That's some good solar panels buddy. How much did you invest in those solar panels? I'm into CPU and GPU mining last 2 years and it's not that good anymore. Asic S9 is so expensive here in our country at the price of almost $1500. I'm finding a good upcoming exchange right now and then i saw this one called [Bitrus](

Trade volumes don't mean anything when it comes to the price of it, actually the trade volume today is more than the trade volume on 11k, but look at their price, its a very huge gap of almost 7,000 USD. I'm looking for a good exchange right now and i saw this one called [Bitrus](

Back in 2014, Vera&amp;John becomes the first licensed and regulated online casino to accept bitcoin deposits. The Malta-registered site began taking deposits from customers on Tuesday, automatically converting them to Euros which would then be paid into customers’ accounts on the site. Customers making bitcoin deposits made at Vera&amp;John will only be able to withdraw those deposits in bitcoin. 
I guess the reason is that bitcoin is hot during that time and the casino owners are very future minded persons. Bitcoin peaked at around $1,000 during that time and it's big compared to previous years.
For now, I'm playing [games]( here and it's a very good site because it's a one stop shop for my gaming needs and they don't tend to drain the money of their players. In fact they have a reminder of responsible gaming at their site.
