Don't worry. It dropped big back in 2013, it was back up to the same level only 3 years later in 2017. Bitcoin will hit 20k again in 2021!
Just some perspective for the people shouting hodl at all cost. The echo-chamber mantra in here is horribly one-sided.

Not at all disingenuous, it peaked round 1100$ late november 2013, then had a massive drop of more than 50%, and it didn't reach into the same levels until early feb 2017. 


My "logic" is to say that you might be seeing no returns, even significant losses the next 3 years or even more. And sure, there might be a new boom at the end of that period, yet there might also not be. History is uncertain and the past is no indicator of the future. But the people saying to Hodl because of past performance owe it to themselves and newcomers to be honest about how long time periods we are talking about when referencing those historical movements. 


It's not a half truth, it's the full truth. **It took nearly 3 years to reach the same levels**. The fact that you don't like the truth because you want to tell a different story doesn't make it less of a truth or a half truth. It just makes you biased.

Seems the prediction model basics are spot on, but he undershot the adoption rate.

Bitcoin forks, value increases.
Bitcoin doesn't fork, value increases...
It's like the [Hawthorne effect](

This is a great representation of the people financing the constant rise of bitcoin while people are pulling out enough money to buy teslas and still keeping their investments in bitcoin. 
People always say "no one looses in an up market" but the truth is that dumb investors like him are the ones losing and paying for the party in the up-market of bitcoin.

That doesn't actually explain anything:


Ok then, so it's a race where contenders get challenges.... From that description for all we know it could have been a three legged race with drinking challenges along the way. 
What were the challenges? In what way was the chosen payment method relevant to the race?

ITT: Idiots with their head up their asses. 
The question is what caused such a sudden movement, it's not about "Is bitcoin tanking, is it all a scam, should I sell my tshirt and move to an island?" 
Whenever fast movements happen, up or down, it's relevant to ask what cause them. They don't just come out of the blue, and a 200dollar drop in 5 min is not "normal" or just regular volatility. If that was the case, the entirety of bitcoin would be set to drop to worthless in a single days time. 
Obviously something happened, and asking about it is a sane thing to do, even if you are holding or buying the dip.
