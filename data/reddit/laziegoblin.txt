Because you shouldn't have to "use proper techniques" to make it work.
Imagine going into the shop with your car and the mechanic tells you "Well, ofc it doesn't work sir, you are using the wrong engine".
you: "Ok, can you put in the proper engine?"
Mechanic: "No, you have to do that yourself EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND DRIVE"
Me: "Or you can just buy another car with the proper engine"..
Also, anyone talking about 'shitcoins' is ignorant or playing ignorant, because there are many coins who work better than BTC. BTC just has the highest market cap, that's the only thing going for it.
"BTC is the best because it's the most secure" well.. If that market cap was in any other coin (All of which work better) so would the miners be.
I'm not even advertising any other coin, but calling BTC the best is dumb.
BTC is the first and worst working coin. Great way to build and improve. Much respect for BTC, but liking BTC gives you no right to shit on things you have no clue about.

Honestly, BTC has been the last coin I bought in a list of many just for that reason. Only reason I have BTC now is because it moves first. 
My main rule is "If the coin can't be moved to a personal wallet without much hassle, it's not worth it". BTC fails, but again.. It'll be the first one to move up.

You can adjust your fee, but in the run up to 20k people had to adjust it to pay more than normal to get it through.

That's a very good point to keep in mind. Thanks

Ok, I guess my holding is still too small.

Didn't people have trouble getting their tx through in the last bull run?

I probably will and just move to my other coins after cashing out.
