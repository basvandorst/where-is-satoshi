whats this site?
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:16:44
sorry but I did not get where I can register as a creditor. Can you tell me how I can do that?

Can you give an exampel? Don't stock markets crash over a longer timeframe like weeks?!

Bitcoin is not scalable enough to serve as a national or even world currency

Just one simple question, does the blockchain save IP addresses or similar personal information associated with transactions/addresses?

yeah, sorry that was a little harsh. I really love the idea of OB. That is why I am a little frustrated with the developments. And I mean what's up with the colors? Take this screenshot 
I mean red on red on red? Have you ever seen a website that looks like that? I cannot imagine that it is so hard to make a GUI that looks like a normal online-shop to which people are already familiar..

Is there a possibility to get updates on this project via email or something?
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:05:57
I don't think so. 
I now managed to get it confirmed with using the viabtc accelerator: 
It is free and worked amazingly fast. If it says they do not have any capacity left try at full hour. Every hour they accept a new batch of txs.

There is only one problem with OB: The GUI looks like shit
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:36:12
I have the same problem and updated to 2.8 but still do not see any of the options when I right click on the transaction in the history tab. Also I have spent all funds and my balance is 0. Therefore the thing with spending an unconfirmed balance to one of my own addresses also does not work. What now?

how is that documentary called?
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:47:17
nice proof :D
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:01:52
I just hope it will be proven that BTC cannot be taken over by a group of an unknown size (NO2X supporters) and no majority support from hashpower and companies building the BTC ecosystem. 
If this would be possible to me that sounds very risky for Bitcoin as a whole.
You all make it sound like that the majority of users support NO2X. I know I don't. Is there any evidence that this assumption is true that the majority of users support NO2X? If yes I would gladly see NO2X as the real BTC otherwise I do not know which fork to call BTC.

Let's say my old mtgox balance was around 6 BTC. The caculator on the mtgox website now tells me that I can claim around 2500€. 2500€ are now worth around 11 BTC. 
When I choose to get payed out in BTC will I get a percentage of the 6 BTC or 11 BTC???
@_date: 2015-04-22 12:21:10
so one can say you could get **one third** of your total BTC balance in mtgox! This is actually more than I thought..

What if I don't support UASF? I cant use electrum anymore?

I have the impression that in Germany it is the same like in the UK. I read one newspaper article and saw some news on TV. 
I noticed that in the newspaper article only in one sentence it was mentioned that 300$ in Bitcoin had to be paid. They did not even explain in like one more sentence what Bitcoin is like they assume everyone knows what Bitcoin is anyway.
