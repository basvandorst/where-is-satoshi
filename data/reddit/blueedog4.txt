Very interesting. 
I would be curious to know the effect of a malicious actor forcing several of these channels to close would have on the overall network. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:13:11
You still need to pay the tx fee to open the channel. Also if few merchants accept LN then you will need to pay to close the channel after a small number of transactions if you want to use/spend the btc tied up in the channel.

The price of bitcoin often moves by 10% or more in a day. The same cannot be said of USDT.

It isn’t like no bank outside the US deals in USD or anything like that...

They probably don’t want to accept a payoff via a bank transfer and want this in certified funds (even if you have collected funds in your bank account). 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:19:59
When you close a channel, an initial transaction is confirmed and if said transaction is not consistent with the most recent state of the channel, you will have previously received a signed transaction from the other party allowing you to spend all of the funds in the channel. After the initial transaction has xxx confirmations, both parties will be able to spend their portion of the settled balance.

Did you have any overdrafts, bounced checks, returned deposits, etc.? If so and you had a lot of money flowing through your account that is why. Checking accounts are very low margin and banks do not want the risk of having to take a loss on an overdraft.

You are safe with a trezor. You should still update because an attacker could potentially try to spend btc, send the transaction to your trezor and you approve it not paying attention.

Circle tried this in a very similar way (they claimed to charge no "fees").
Circle did not end up "crushing" coinbase, and circle eventually stopped allowing bitcoin trades (for all intents and purposes) on their platform.

I have no idea what you mean by this. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:14:54
The transaction size to open and close channels are larger than most transactions you would “normally” make, so technically speaking, you have to pay a larger than normal transaction fee.

My understanding is the laptop was encrypted, however in order to use the laptop, you will need to decrypt the information on the hard drive with the encryption key, which is stored in RAM. After the laptop was taken from him, an FBI agent used a special tool to make it appear that someone was periodically moving the mouse so the laptop would not shut down, and subsequently used another tool to extract the information contained in the laptop's RAM (eg. the decryption key).

The government was able to obtain sufficient evidence to convict Ulbright for crimes that carry a life sentence. Often times when someone has committed many crimes, they will charge them with only the most serious crimes (with the harshest potential sentence), or the crimes with the most evidence against the defendant, and if he is found 'not guilty' the government will prosecute for other crimes that were committed separately. 
While I do agree that Silk Road was generally not hurting anyone, even though it was breaking many laws, it is very difficulty to support someone who allegedly hired hitmen to kill those who were threatening him. Granted the conversations/logs could have been faked, however there were both wire transfers and bitcoin transactions implying an attempted hire did in fact take place.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:48:55
Your post is very misleading. They **tested** LN with a single transaction between two people that trusted each other. This is also not available to their customers. Even what they tested is very far from what LN is promised to be.

BCH already has a larger maximum block size, so they do not need SW for a "scaling" solution. BCH might implement something similar to SW to allow for LN, or something similar.

The government had other evidence against him, so they may still have gotten a conviction. I understand the government did not present all the evidence they had that was in their favor. Having the laptop did make it more of a slam dunk case though.

One inaccuracy I did notice was at the end when they finally got the laptop the group mined with, it was said the wallet was empty, and Sheldon had "downloaded" the wallet onto a flash drive. If this had happened, Sheldon would only have created a copy of the wallet, and the coins would still be available on the laptop. In order for the coins to not be available on the laptop, Sheldon would have had to have created a new wallet saved on the flash drive, and move the coins onto that wallet, and that transaction would have been shown on the old wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:15:21
Actually LN is still vaporware, and as such, I think it is a bit of a stretch to say "LN works".

Actually, the size of transactions opening and closing LN channels are considerably larger than transactions that we know today, so more likely than not, LN will result in much higher tx fees if the max block size is not increased.

Yes a LN channel can replace a potentially unlimited number of transactions, however these transactions may not actually have occurred if it were not for that channel, for example “hop” transactions between channels. 
Also the transaction size to open a LN channel is much larger than two “normal” transactions we see today. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:09:41
This depends on what "newbie mistakes" you made. If you got scammed, then you can deduct the theft after certain thresholds and conditions are met for example. If you were moving money between exchange accounts, you may be able to argue the tx fees are trading expenses (however this would likely be disallowed if you were simply playing around with your coins, and paid a bunch of tx fees while moving btc between your wallets).

It would be a lot more than that. At $5k/BTC, if they found only one block (50 BTC at the time), their coins would be worth $250k. IMO, realistically they would have had millions worth of bitcoin.

To be fair, you can really just download the associated records if you wanted to close your account. 
Also, if you adhered to your logic, you would actually need to keep your account open many years after you paid taxes associated with trading activity on your account because of the risk of audit. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:27:45
You have testimony from multiple FBI agents who witnessed the chain of evidence in regards to the laptop. I understand that multiple technicians performed multiple functions to ensure the contents of the laptop were not changed (I think, not 100% sure on this). 
Even if you were to argue the logs were faked (with is honestly a weak argument based on how the rules of evidence works), this would not explain the keys found on the laptop, specifically the bitcoin private keys to the "cold storage" for Silk Road that were very clearly associated with Silk Road based on blockchain evidence.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:03:57
This is not the case. You have to put on your tax return what you paid for your coins (you can choose to put a lower amount, and pay more taxes if you wish). If you get audited, you may have somewhat of a headache documenting your cost basis, however it would not be impossible.

So you are saying that BCH cannot implement SegWit, or anything similar thereto? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:50:06
The process you describe is not reasonably feasible when you are processing hundreds or thousands of withdrawals per day. 
I would also point out that compromising private keys is not the only way an attacker can steal money from a bitcoin related business. If an attacker is able to compromise the database that keeps track of individual account balances, then you can trick the business into thinking your account has a higher balance than it should, and into processing a withdrawal to an address the attacker controls. If I understand the hicehash attack correctly, the attacker was able to change account balances.

I understand there were private keys on the laptop that would only be on a computer that was in possession of the admin/owner of Silk Road. Also, he was logged onto the Silk Road backend as an admin when his laptop was seized by the FBI.

My understanding of the tax implications of mining is that if for example, you mined 1 BTC in 2016, the value of the BTC at the time you mined it was $1,000, and you had $500 in expenses related to mining, and did not sell any of the BTC you mined, then you would owe taxes on $500 in 2016. If, in 2017, you subsequently sold the BTC you mined for $15,000, then your cost basis would be $1,000 and your profit would be $14,000, which you would need to pay taxes on in 2017. If you moved from South Carolina to Georgia on Jan 1, 2017, you would owe SC taxes on your 2016 income, and GA taxes on your 2017 income.

The OP was providing his services on credit so he would be in no different situation if the transaction confirms in 10 minutes verses in 30 seconds, and after &lt;30 seconds, for all intents and purposes, he knows the transaction will confirm (why would someone double spend a transaction for a payment for services already received?).

If the current state of the channel is, upon settlement you will receive the entire balance, then you should close the channel.

You are correct in that posting the link to the new BU software was against the rules. However threads discussing (critically) BU, and it's software was also against the rules, but was allowed. 
Also, that rule makes it very difficult to even get a reading if major economic players, and the community as a whole supports a particular proposal. The effect of saying "I support this proposal, but only if everyone else supports it" is much less than someone saying "I support this proposal, and believe this is the best way forward for Bitcoin"

Mining at a loss is counter to the economic principals that makes it safe to use Bitcoin and trusting the miners as a whole. The miners have economic incentives to act honestly, and the assumption that miners will act economically rational is what allows a Bitcoin user to trust a transaction will not get reversed after a certain number of confirmations. 
With the above being said, just because current USD rates for BTC and BCH say that BCH is more profitable to mine than BTC, does not make this a fact. The reason for this potential discrepancy is the fact that miners will need to take on additional market risks while they wait for their found blocks to mature (there is a risk the price of BCH declines between when they find a block and when they can sell the BCH block reward). There is also counterparty risk as miners may not be able to use the same channels to sell mined BCH, and/or miners may short 12.5 BCH (or whatever their block reward is) verses BTC, USD, or a combination of both when they find a block and cover the position when the block reward matures, and the platform this is done on may result in a greater counterparty risk verses a miner simply mining BTC. The discount for these risks is going to be different for different miners, however it may result in some miners realizing a higher USD profit when mining BTC when the current price alone would indicate otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:55:38
A malicious miner could do a re-org if he has sufficient hashpower. A re-org that takes place in the "normal" course of operations could result in someone being able to double spend a transaction that at one point had confirmations.

Yea, I read the trezor blog saying they will have a SW beta wallet in the coming days, and I know ThomasV is a SW supporter, and a very good programmer, so I would not be surprised to see Electrum SegWit in the near future. 
The times I have run full nodes in the past, I really have never utilized the GUI, as most of the times I would run them via a rented VPS. The hardware I have at home is really not ideal to be running a full node, as I only have a laptop that I like to put to sleep, and waiting the several minutes (or longer) is not ideal to wait for Core to safely shut down/close, plus the resources required to run a full node is a bit high for a laptop on a battery. In the past I would run a full node in order to play around with some of the settings, the CLI commands, to broadcast some of my own transactions, and to support certain implementations, however it becomes rather expensive when you can use Bitcoin for free (from a cost of hardware perspective) via a light client. 
I would like to use SegWit for real financial transactions that I conduct, however I don't think I would trust that I can sufficiently secure my VPS (I have locked down my VPS in the past, however I have never had actual money at stake), or even that my "VPS neighbors" are not listening to what I have in RAM.

Technically we don't know with certainty. Although it is probably a reasonable assumption this is a SegWit address, especially considering Trezor recently rolled out their beta SegWit wallet for trezor users.

I think his concerns are regarding carefully crafted moderation policies, and the uneven enforcement of rules. 
I remember some number of months ago, there was an exploit that could cause Bitcoin Unlimited nodes to crash. Shortly after a Bitcoin Core developer encouraged others to take advantage of this exploit, a hot fix was implemented and pushed to the Bitcoin Unlimited GitHub repository. Links to the actual page to download the hot fix version of BU was disallowed, while a thread claiming to be the link to the hot fix that was actually a link to the bitcoin.org page to download Bitcoin Core was allowed, as were threads critical of the Bitcoin Unlimited devs. 
The moderation policy should be based on the actual desires of the market, which I don't believe is something r/bitcoin is doing currently. Granted the fact that both sides of the blocksize debate are using shills and other astroturfing methods makes it difficult to tell what the "market" really wants, however I think it is clear the market desires moderation policies other than that of r/bitcoin. I cannot account for the vastly different tones of conversations between r/bitcoin and r/btc

Well Bitcoin has gone through periods of increased inflation, this is why the difficulty has increased to the level it has, because of higher than expected (10 minute blocks) inflation. If Bitcoin Cash is to survive over the long run, it will need to make changes to the EDA.
I don't think SegWit adoption will accelerate because of BCH in itself, although SegWit adoption may accelerate because of long periods of it being more profitable to mine on the BCH network than the BTC network, causing temporary long periods between blocks.

It looks like most of the wallets mentioned in that thread are capable of enforcing SegWit rules but not capable of receiving btc via a SegWit address. So they would be able to reject a transaction with missing signature data (it would never get confirmed anyway) etc.  
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:17:32


That is a pretty big "if". The current price of Bitcoin Cash is ~8.1% of bitcoin, and that procedure would have been horribly unprofitable to this kind of attacker. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:40:10
I would not call the Bitcoin Cash EDA a "bug".
However the EDA feature of Bitcoin Cash does cause the BTC block time to periodically spike, resulting in very high necessary tx fees to get transactions confirmed in the Bitcoin blockchain, which may result in more companies especially adopting SegWit. 
The 75% discount on a $30 transaction fee is a lot greater than a 74% discount on a $4 transaction fee. In terms of USD or BTC at least.

No. Legacy transactions have their entire transaction size counted as space towards the 1MB limit. The signature portion of SegWit transactions are given a 75% discount towards the 1MB limit. The non-signature portion of SegWit transactions are counted towards the 1MB limit with no discount.

This is because hashpower is moving between the BCH and BTC networks depending on profitability of each to mine on. When it is more profitable to mine on the BCH network, block times on the BTC network will increase, causing the necessary fee to get a transaction confirmed on the BTC network to increase. 
Fee estimate websites/software use historical block data to estimate how large a fee to use to get a transaction included in a block. The general minimum historical data it is safe to use is 24 hours worth, so fee estimates will be much higher than necessary for at least 24 hours after hashpower returns back to the BTC network.

bitcoinfees.21.co is good when there are no large changes in the network hashrate.

Ummm, this is literally the opposite case. Exchanges that have policies of crediting BCH did not have massive net BTC withdrawals, and some may have actually had net BTC deposits. 
If an exchange only has 0.9 BTC (for example) for every 1 BTC in customer deposits, they could simply buy 0.1 BCH for every BTC on deposit on their market in order to allow for everyone to withdraw.

If SegWit was implemented via a hard fork (and obtained the necessary consensus for one, the consensus that was absent for the SW soft fork), then it would be trivial to force users (including coinbase) to use SW, but this did not happen.

@_date: 2017-11-18 04:04:08
Exchanges and businesses that regularly process customer withdrawals really cannot go cheap on transaction fee rates. If a withdrawal transaction doesn’t confirm quickly, not only will it cause negative customer experience for those wanting for a specific transaction to confirm, it will tie up additional money that belongs to the exchange while waiting for the transaction to confirm which will delay creating additional withdrawal transactions. 
Also a one input two output transaction is unusual for most businesses if they are going to batch withdrawals because they must consolidate inputs from deposits and spend to multiple outputs if they batch withdrawals. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:44:14
I don’t think this is very realistic. Individual users have virtually zero influence on price nor acceptance of bitcoin and rational users will care more about usability than features that will have (near) zero immediate impact on Bitcoin. 
The miners activated SegWit (likely under false pretenses) and if they had not activated SW, we would almost certainly not have SW today. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:19:53
tether will only redeem USDT for USD. It is other exchanges that allow traders to trade USDT for BTC (etc.), however if an exchange allowed someone to trade the USDT associated with that address, the exchange would be unable to redeem the USDT for USD, so they have very strong incentives to disallow that kind of trade.

@_date: 2017-11-10 05:59:07
This is actually inaccurate. Moving coins to SW addresses/wallets will increase fees (by a fair large amount) because the network will have to deal with a lot of transactions that would not normally otherwise happen. 
I’m order for SW to result in fee-rate reductions, users will have to receive transactions to SW addresses they would normally receive and subsequently spend those inputs as part of transactions they would normally send.

My personal opinion is that he is a fraud, however that is my opinion. If you state things as a fact that are defamatory (if they were false), you are opening yourself up to potential liability for libel. The burden is on him to prove what you say is untrue because he is a public figure— this is true under US law, however he is threatening to take you to court in a different jurisdiction, but I assume libel laws are similar.

A couple of things:
1) BitPay has the right to earn a profit from their business. As long as they are not misleading customers as to what these fees go towards, they should be able to charge amounts above their actual costs.
2) '*most of the time*' or the '*majority of the time*' is not going to be good enough for businesses that send a large volume of transactions.

MtGox halted trading on February 24, 2014, and bitcoin was trading in the high $500's that day, however it fell to around $450 the following day, and was trading at around $800 before they halted withdrawals on February 7, 2014. I don't think this would hold up in court, but one might argue that bitcoin should have been valued at $800, which would roughly double the claims, however even if this happened, there would be a lot of bitcoin left over. 
I am not familiar with Japanese bankruptcy law, however in the US, when a company is liquidated, creditors are paid first, and after creditors are repaid in full, anything left over goes to shareholders. I really cannot imagine a scenario in which creditors would receive many times the amount of money they are owed, if this were allowed under the law, I don't think anyone would ever invest in equity of Japanese companies.

Well disk space really is not that expensive, so realistically blockchain bloat is not really an issue. The same can be said about bandwidth as most residential internet connections would be able to download an 8MB block within 10 seconds (which is faster than it really needs to be for a "retail" user of Bitcoin). 
The UTXO issue would remain, however this would still be an issue with how Bitcoin is now. The UTXO set would have the potential to increase as a faster rate, however SW somewhat gives users incentives to consolidate UTXOs by way of discounting signature data.

This is true, however I believe many people have been buying up BTC (and ETH) with the intent of using those coins to invest in (various) ICOs, including many people from/in China. 
If these people can no longer invest in ICOs then the reason they bought BTC (and ETH) will go away, and they will sell their coins.

That is not true. If you include an additional 144 byte transaction, then it will take (very) slightly longer for your block to be sent to other miners, and slightly longer for the other miners to validate your block. During this slightly longer time, it is possible that another miner will have found a block, broadcast it, and other miners have accepted it and are mining on top of it, resulting in your block getting orphaned. 
The cost of including an additional transaction is the chance that the additional transaction will cause the block to get orphaned times the total block reward.

The problem with this service is exchange rate risk.

Actually, in the past the number of Bitcoin transaction (on chain) has grown at a rate of about 17% per year. The number of Bitcoin transactions is not going to increase by 1000's overnight, and it is probably safe to have 4, or 8 MB blocks today if a 1 MB block was safe in 2010.

I also have never had a deposit get reversed for any reason, nor have I had any kind of overdraft. I suspect one of the main reasons so many accounts get closed is because people are having scammers deposit what turns out to be fraudulent deposits into their accounts.

The doubling of the transaction capacity will make the alleged "spam attacks" many times more expensive and it will take a fraction of the time for a backlog of transactions to clear after a "spam attack" is finished. 
The first time there is a HF, there will be a lot of fear and uncertainty regarding how it will play out, if it is safe, etc. The bitcoin cash HF largely dispelled these fears, however the 'main' bitcoin chain remained, so there is still some fear of a HF. After it can be shown that a HF can be successful without a ridiculous amount of advance notice, and without any major disruptions to the network, there will be less resistance to future HFs.

I am not quite sure I follow your logic. Based on the data I have looked at, many new additional short positions were created when bitcoin was trading in the 4500-4600 range, and many more new short positions were created as the price fell ~10% to where we are now. It looks like long positions were gradually being pared back (closed) while we were at ~4600, however many new long positions were opened while the price was falling. 
I don't see any urgent reason why shorts would need to cover their positions at 4100, or why they would have a need to cover if the price bounces at 4100. If anything, there will be pressure on longs to sell at this price point.

The reason their agreement has any kind of weight is because the market has decided their businesses should collectively conduct the majority of Bitcoin related business. If the people who made the NY agreement were random joes then no one would care about it and it would be promptly ignored. 
Bitcoin is not any kind of democracy. It is defined by consensus rules and those that give it value decide those rules. Part of the reason Bitcoin has value is because users can use their Bitcoin to buy things via bitpay and one of the the reasons merchants accept bitcoin is because bitpay allows transactions to be processed more cheaply than would be possible with a credit card — this logic can be repeated with other companies that signed the NY agreement at least the major ones. 
No one cares that shill joe user wants 1 mb blocks no matter what and the rejection of blocks by this person means nothing. You are free to call SW2X whatever you want however as it stands now, it will almost certainly have more security, value and utility than the bitcoin used via core 15.1

Yes, mod logs could potentially silence claims of censorship, however open mod logs could potentially be abused in a way so that certain accounts make certain statements, AND otherwise violate the rules, resulting in a ban, making it appear there is censorship when this is not the case. So opening the mod logs is not as clear cut a solution as you present it. 
As I mentioned previously, I disagree with some of the moderation policies and practices.

Replay protection only protects the minority chain (eg core 15.1). The idea is that SW2X will replace what is known as Bitcoin today, and not having replay protection means that chain will likely quickly die off.

You only have to pay taxes on the gains you have between when you purchased the bitcoin and when you exchange it for goods/services. So if you purchased $100 worth of bitcoin, you will have paid taxes on that $100 previously, and if you subsequently sell that bitcoin for $125 worth of goods, then you would owe taxes on the $25 gain.

This is something difficult to prove, especially considering that Peter Todd has sufficient resources to engage in this kind of transaction without it being traced back to him. Absent an admission from him, it will pretty much not be proven.
With that being said, there were massive ddos attacks against competing forks, and fork proposals, I don't think this can be disputed. One of the ddos attacks against a fork proposal, bitcoin xt even knocked out the internet for an entire neighborhood because one person in the neighborhood was running an xt node. 
Peter Todd did however make very public a flaw in a competing fork's node software very shortly after it was discovered, ultimately resulting in the majority of those implementations nodes offline.

My understanding of LN is this cannot be enforced. When a transaction is being sent across more than one hop, it is not possible to know where the money previously came from.

SW2X has overwhelming miner support, and has overwhelming support of the economy. The "average joe" users are mostly neutral and ultimately care about the end user experience. The Core Devs are against it, however their opinion means nothing because they have zero skin in the game, and are nothing more than ~~employees~~ volunteers (or they claim).  
Further, and more importantly, one of the (likely primary) reasons the miners activated SW was because of the 2MB fork to happen in November. If the businesses who agreed to SW2X renege on supporting SW2X, then the miners will not trust these businesses in the future, and will not agree to additional soft forks that may be needed to enable additional features in Bitcoin.

7 TPS pre-SW assumes all transactions have one input and two outputs, which does not match reality. Users will need to spend multiple outputs as they accumulate inputs, and more outputs need to be created as adoption increases.

A lot of people sold when BTCC closed down, and from the looks of it, a lot of people are selling after ViaBTC is closing.

It is more than “some” it is very clearly the majority of miners by hashrate and the majority of the businesses by transaction volume both by a large margin. The userbase is more difficult to measure however most users are agnostic about the issue.

I am not exactly sure I would say what he says has any kind of authority. This guy literally pretended to be a pilot, lawyer and doctor, among other professions to defraud many people out of a lot of money, when he had zero training in any of those fields. 
I don’t think Blockchain will solve all of the worlds problems but it does have the potential to upend a lot of industries.

Maybe that is a bad example. But “investing” in crypto is a gamble that has happened to work out well who have played so far. There doesn’t need to be a House edge in order for someone to gamble- if you bet your friend the local team will win there is no house but it is still gambling.

That it not the reckless part of his post. The reckless part is forcing rule changes.

You can use Localbitcoins, however don't expect to use anything except cash if you don't want to verify your identity.

I am  not sure where you are getting this from.

I feel like this is a bit misleading

If this is not faked, this is a single investor who, IIRC, only needed to invest a minimum of a few thousand dollars who is complaining.

Both r/bitcoin and r/btc are not much more than propaganda platforms and neither are representative of the userbase.

He did not sell any bitcoin, but he sold the concept of and the technology behind Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:48:07
If that is true, then your numbers simply do not add up. Sorry

It is interesting how the OP takes a single thread that someone posts to be representative of an entire sub.

When people are thinking BTC will increase by &gt;10X in the next ~2 months, I think we are at the peak of a bubble.....oh wait

You should receive relevant tax forms from the brokerage you used to purchase GBTC 
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:41:56
That article really did not give any useful information/advice. 
At the end of the day, the best advice is to pay the proper amount of taxes as per current law. If you disagree with the tax laws, you should vote for representation in the government who will vote to change the law.

Lol, the day that cobra comes out as Roger Ver is the day after hell freezes over.

Yea I always get a little nervous whenever I withdraw large amounts from Gemini because there is exactly zero delay from when I enter the 2FA code and when the transaction is broadcast. I don't have the opportunity to double check after the fact to make sure I didn't screw something up. 
I have withdrawn over $200k on a couple of occasions with this experience.

If by 24, you mean 36, then yes.

There are certain circumstances in which governments can shut down businesses. Shutting down a business is not punishing their customers, it is punishing their owners. 
To my knowledge btc-e funds that belong to their customers have not been seized, however it is not outside of the realm of possibilities for btc-e customer funds to be seized, and if they are, then the government would be obligated to return said funds, provided certain conditions are met (eg legal ownership of said funds can be established).

I believe Ver is referencing the subsidy that SegWit transactions receive in the form of the discount of their signature data.

Based on the available information, it is unclear if the hacker tricked binance into creating new API/2FA codes for the hacker, or if the hacker obtained these codes from various binance customers.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:58:19
Do you have any links to announcements regarding withdrawal delays from Coinbase, and/or customer complaints of the same?
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:08:51
The rates are this high because polo will not give BCH to BTC lenders.  
Also, it is likely that the vast majority of these loans will be repaid very shortly after Aug 1, so you will probably not get that interest rate for the entire term if it is scheduled to expire/mature long after that. 
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:01:26
if the codes were from binance, the attacker most likely tricked binance into generating new 2FA codes to be associated with each of the accounts. 
I don't think the statement you quoted rules out the attacker collecting all this information from various customers, and waiting to use it all at once. 
CZ is holding an AMA later tonight, and I am sure he will be asked many questions about the hack.
