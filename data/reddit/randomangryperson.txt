I think what probably happened is that the clearing fee rate dropped low enough that your second transaction kinda became CPFP by accident.  Fees around 180 sat/B are currently clearing, so your second transaction at 380 was effectively double the going rate, so it was taken as good enough for both transactions.  Either way, you're in the clear now.

To be completely honest, I haven't the faintest clue... I'm not even in the same universe of smart as Satoshi or even any of his contemporaries.  Having said that, I think the discussion basically centers around that being the only possible attack, as all other forms of attack would be rejected by honest nodes on other grounds, and I think this is the fundamental mathematics that underlies the concept of the number of confirmations that are required before a given transaction can be considered effectively immutable.

Yes. Inputs with bech32 addresses are considerably smaller. 
 See [here]( for the specifics.


Bech32 support is expected to be included in the core reference client in the upcoming 0.16.0 segwit support release.  Once that is out there, I think wider spread adoption will accelerate.

Vendor as in you.  You don't get to keep the victim's money just because you can't get your btc back.  And it's a good thing you didn't know.  Because you didn't know, they'll probably just take the money back.  If they could prove that you did know, and took the money anyway, knowing it was stolen, you would be guilty of possession of the proceeds of a crime, punishable by up to 2 years in jail for an amount under $5k, and up to 10 years in jail for an amount over $5k.

No, the inverse is not true.  I was just saying if it was pre-3.0.0 it was guaranteed not to be a segwit wallet.  As others have pointed out, Electrum creates bech32 addresses by default.  If you had just selected "Segwit" as the wallet type when you created it, you would have "bc1" addresses, not "3" addresses.  As they also mentioned, the only way you can get "3" segwit addresses in Electrum is by importing a BIP49 seed.

There are no such thing as "segwit blocks".  There are segwit addresses, and transactions which spend coins from segwit addresses.  Those transactions go into blocks on the bitcoin blockchain, along with standard non-segwit transactions, like every other transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:26:27
I am really not an expert on how to recover non-viable transactions, cause I've never made one.  There are a variety of approaches.
CPFP:  Child pays for parent.  This has a child transaction pay for the fees for both transactions.  Never done one, no idea on the details of exactly how you go about it.
RBF:  Replace by fee.  Has to be supported by your wallet and you have to have enabled it when you created the initial transaction.  Again, not sure on specifics and it probably varies by wallet.
Double Spend.  At some point, the low fee transaction may be removed from the network and show back up in your wallet.  At that point, you could spend it again with a fee high enough that the new transaction confirms.  This would invalidate the earlier one, and any that depend on it.  If they were ever mined, they would just be discarded because their inputs are now invalid.  Again, never done one myself and not 100% sure on the details.
Maybe someone who has experience in these kinds of recoveries could guide you further.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:28:21
If your wallet doesn't have a feature to re-broadcast a transaction (or doesn't do it automatically) , then I would just resend the transactions.  Once the new transactions confirm, if the old ones somehow re-appear in the mempool, they would just be dropped, because their inputs would be invalid (double spent).
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:36:48
You're confirmed now.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:52:07
It is important to understand, that with bitcoin, you don't have a "balance", and you can't spend arbitrary amounts of it.  You have "unspent transaction outputs" (UTXOs), which are discreet values of coins that you have received from previous transactions, each of them a separate entity.  When you spend an output, you spend the *entire* output.  Any amount that is left over beyond the amount you are trying to send, must be returned to you as "change", which again, is another new, separate, discreet output.
You sent your first transaction, and consumed a single input worth 0.05421821 BTC, and sent 0.0001 BTC of it somewhere, paid 0.000045 BTC in fees (~20 sat/B) and the remaining 0.05407321 BTC was returned to you on an output to a change address.  This transaction has NOT completed, because of the low fee.  The thing to understand here is that the original input is gone... spent... and the change output is not yet fully available to you because the transaction has not yet completed.
You then spent the 0.05407321 BTC change output on your second transaction.  Some wallets allow this.  Personally, I prefer to always use wallets that specifically disallow this behavior (for example in Electrum, enabling the "Spend only confirmed coins" option.) to avoid exactly these kinds of problems.  But you can't actually spend that change output, because that output has not been confirmed yet.  Until the first transaction confirms, the second one will not be able to.  This is what is being indicated on your second transaction by the red "U" beside that input (if you are not seeing that, click on "show scripts &amp; coinbase" at the bottom of the right column.)  This wouldn't be a huge problem if both transactions were paying appropriate fees, but alas...
So yes, the the transactions are "somehow binded".  The second transaction depends on an output from the first, and cannot complete until it does.  Both transactions exist, and are valid, but they have to complete in order, and because the fees are so low on the first one, that's a problem.

If you are sending funds to it from Coinbase/GDAX, you should use standard, because Electrum Segwit wallets use bech32 addresses, which Coinbase/GDAX does not support and will not recognize as a valid address.  When your nano arrives, you can create a segwit wallet on it and send to that.  Alternatively, you can save yourself one transaction fee by waiting and sending it directly from Coinbase/GDAX to the nano's segwit wallet, because the nano uses P2SH based addresses for their segwit wallet, which Coinbase/GDAX does recognize.  Just depends on how paranoid you are about leaving your coins on Coinbase (and I understand if the answer is "enough to pay an extra transaction fee to get them off there sooner")

Because p2sh has been around for quite a while, and everyone has already implemented it, so, to put it simply, it works.  It is nearly universally understood.


It is impossible to know the future, and even more impossible to predict what players like coinbase will ~~do~~ drag their feet on, but yes, of course, it will become more widely adopted.  Bech32 support is currently planned to be included as part of the segwit UI implementation for the bitcoin core reference client in version 0.16.  As it becomes more widely adopted, there will be natural compatibility pressures on all providers to at least minimally recognize bech32 addresses as valid, even if they don't use them themselves.

Lightning network doesn't get added to bitcoin.  LN is a separate, independent system that sits on top of (or beside) bitcoin.  It doesn't change bitcoin in any way.
For things that do actually change the actual bitcoin network and protocol, the answer to "who changes it" is everyone, and no one.  Bitcoin is an open source project, and changes are only made to it by consensus.  There is a bitcoin reference client, to which there is a list of people who are allowed to commit new or changed code to that repository, but if they committed code that people didn't agree with, people would simply fork the repository, reverse those changes, and run that software instead.  If such a change is made, and a large number of people want to run the original software, and another large number of people want to run the changed software, and those softwares are incompatible, then a chain split happens.  This is what most people typically call a "fork", although that's not entirely accurate, and the original coin and the new coin go their separate ways.  No one can force anything on bitcoin and its users, and no one has "control".

It takes 10 minutes *on average* for a block to be found.  Sometimes, 3 blocks are found in 10 minutes.  Sometimes, it takes 30, 40, 50 minutes or more to find one.  Even if it was exactly on the 10 minute average, if it had been 5 minutes since the last block was found, you submit your transaction, 5 minutes pass and a block is found, that's still 10 minutes per block.  The time it takes your individual transaction to get confirmed is irrelevant to how fast blocks are being found.

I'm not going to try and figure out all the balances.  You'll have to figure out who needs to send who what.  I can only comment on the 3 transactions associated with the address you linked, and say that they probably have expired out of the mempool and need to be re-broadcast/resent.  If your friend sent you transactions back that depend on outputs from those transactions, and obviously those haven't confirmed either, those will also never confirm if you resend yours.  At the moment, you can assume that it is as if those 3 transactions, and any transactions that depend on them, never happened.

The shares you are hashing are configured with a coinbase transaction (the transaction that pays the block reward and fees to the miner) with a destination address that belongs to the pool.  You cannot change this address (or any other data) after you have "found" a block without invalidating the block you just found.  If you change the address before you "find" the block, you might as well be solo mining anyway.
TL;DR:  No.

Depends on which kind of segwit address.  P2SH wrapped P2WPKH (address starts with a "3") should be supported by virtually any exchange as they all should support P2SH.  Bech32 native segwit addresses (as most commonly currently seen in Electrum segwit wallets, address starts with "bc1"), are unlikely to be supported by most exchanges at this time.

You are possibly confusing Segwit, which has been an integral part of the bitcoin network for almost 2 years, and became fully active on the bitcoin mainnet in August of last year, with the failed Segwit2x hostile hard fork, which was an attempt by a group of miners, exchanges and companies to force a blocksize increase on the bitcoin network, which because it was far from universally accepted by bitcoin users, would have caused a chain split.  When it became clear that their attempt was going to fail, they withdrew their attempt.  Despite the name, Segwit has nothing to do with and was not and is not dependent on the failed Segwit2x.  (side note, the recently launched Segwit2x altcoin has absolutely nothing to do with the original Segwit2x proposal, and is again yet another completely separate (and completely irrelevant) thing.)  Segwit is an integral (although optional) part of bitcoin, and has been for almost 6 months now.

Yes, your quoted text is simply wrong.  There is no sidechain, there is no majority accepting anything.  There was considerable debate regarding the initial activation of Segwit on the mainnet last August, culminating in the adoption of BIP-141 (and substantial support for BIP-148) which were the formal mechanisms that activated Segwit on the mainnet, but there was no "sidechain" involved in that process, and the matter is long since settled regarding majority acceptance.  Those who did not accept it forked off and created BCash.  Segwit is now just an optional feature of bitcoin.  Simple as that.

Far as I can see, the transaction is fine.  A burst of 200-240 sat/B traffic came in probably right around the time you submitted this, so it's slightly buried, but only slightly.  The network has already chewed through more than half of the 220-240 stuff.  There's only about 5-6MB of stuff above you as I write this, so you should be confirmed soon-ish.

The fee you pay on a transaction is determined by the transaction size, which is determined by the number of inputs and outputs (plus a very small overhead).  Whether your inputs are all on one address or each on their own address is irrelevant.  If you receive 10 orders, you will have 10 UTXOs, and if you want to spend them all (or consolidate them all on one address), you will pay for a transaction with 10 inputs, regardless of whether those inputs are 1 address or 10 different addresses.

As you say, there is the privacy issue, and that's the only real hard, tangible issue... at the moment.
My understanding is that a potential secondary issue arises when you go to spend coins on an address.  Your address is an encoded (double) hash of your public key, so it is very secure, and putting your address out there doesn't reveal any information potentially linked to your private key.  When you spend coins, you must reveal your un-hashed public key in order to validate the signature.  If you have multiple outputs on the same address, and you spend only some of them, the public key associated with the remaining outputs is now known.
There is some concern that someday, there may be an attack discovered, possibly through quantum computing, that compromises elliptic curve cryptography, and having the public key known for outputs that still hold coins would be potentially dangerous in that situation.  Note that there is no currently known attack that would make this an issue, but it is revealing a piece of information that would be useful, and doesn't need to be revealed.  Always completely spending all outputs associated with an address and sending the change output elsewhere (which is easy and the default behavior if there is only one output in the first place) alleviates this concern by leaving no coins associated with an address for which the public key has been revealed.

Load has actually been fairly steady for the last 12 hours at rates above your 325 sat/B.  That said, however, there is currently only about 3-4 MB of transactions above that rate, so it's quite likely you will be confirmed sooner rather than later... hours, not days.

The fees that  you are specifying on the send transaction page are in BTC/kB of data, so 0.00109000 is 109000 satoshis per kB, or 109 sat/B.  On the confirmation screen it is showing you the fees actually paid on the actual size of your transaction at that fee rate.  Your actual transaction appears to be 225 bytes, and the fee you paid is 24634 satoshis, or 109 sat/B * 226, which is pretty close, but I can't really say why there's an off by 1 there, if that's what you're wondering about.

Yes, you have to move your coins to a segwit address in order to take advantage of segwit.  Note also, that Electrum's segwit implementation uses bech32 native segwit addresses (addresses that start with "bc1" instead of "3"), which are very new and not widely supported yet, so you might want to hold off on that move until bech32 achieves wider adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:51:07
You can indeed send money from a segwit address to a non-segwit one without problems, as far as I know, even if it's a bech32 address.  The problem arises if someone else needs to send btc to your segwit wallet.  There are not very many wallets that understand bech32 addresses yet, so they enter your address and their wallet says "that's not a bitcoin address, try again".
You'll have no problem sending from your Electrum standard wallet to your Electrum segwit wallet, because Electrum understands bech32 addresses, so that works fine.  Other people sending to you using Electrum will similarly have no problems.  But if the person trying to send to you is using a wallet that doesn't understand bech32 addresses, they might have problems sending to you.  Once more wallets implement segwit support and bech32 addresses, this will become less of an issue, so that's why you might want to wait. 
If all you're doing is sending your coins from your standard wallet to your segwit wallet, and then mostly holding, maybe occasionally spending, then you shouldn't have any issues.

The block was found only 13 seconds after the previous block.  This is not enough time for the node that services the stratum server for the pool to receive the new block, validate all the transactions, remove the completed transaction from the local mempool, and generate new shares and distribute them to the pool.  Until that process is complete, the pool mines shares that contain no transactions, so that hash power is not wasted.  In this case, during that period, a miner got lucky and found a block before the process could complete.  This is normal, and happens fairly frequently, typically once or twice a day on average.

As with many things in life, it's a trade-off between convenience and security/privacy.  As long as all the address is ever doing is receiving, you don't really have to worry about anything except the privacy implications.  If you ever spend outputs on that address however, for safety, you must spend all of them, and send any remainder to a new address (after which, you should change the donation address to minimize any future outputs to it).  If you've received a lot of outputs, that's likely to be a very expensive transaction, fee wise, because of the size of all the inputs.  If all your outputs were to independent addresses, you could spend them all independently without worrying about that.

Electrum segwit wallets generate bech32 native segwit addresses (start with "bc1"), which are very new, so yes, many older wallets do not yet support those addresses.  It's not really an issue of Coinbase not supporting segwit, since Coinbase can send to a segwit P2WSH address (starts with "3") just fine... they see it as any other P2SH address.  I would say that eventually Coinbase would implement support for these new addresses, but this Coinbase we're talking about... so who knows.
Your alternatives for now are either to generate a standard wallet, send to that, and then send from your standard wallet to your segwit wallet.  The downside of that is that it's an extra transaction with an extra transaction fee.  Alternatively, you can generate a P2SH segwit address and key pair, and then import that into an electrum wallet.  Note that imported keys operate outside of the traditional "seed word" deterministic wallet structure, so you must make sure you back up the wallet file with imported keys directly.  Someone posted a [video]( here yesterday on how to do this, disclaimer: I have not personally watched this, but you can check it out and decide if it's useful to you.

Electrum Segwit wallets use [bech32]( native segwit addresses (addresses that start with "bc1").  The bech32 standard, while it appears is on track to become a standard format, is very new and not widely adopted yet, and Electrum is pretty much the only major wallet that supports it.  Many if not most other wallets and services will not recognize bc1 addresses as valid bitcoin addresses, so you will have difficulty sending coins to that wallet.  
If you only intend to transfer existing coins from an existing Electrum wallet to a new Electrum segwit wallet, and then are primarily spending from that wallet (or holding), you should be fine, but if you need to receive coins to the wallet, you are probably better off with a standard wallet for the time being, until bech32 is more widely supported.

It is important to understand the difference between your public key, and your address.
The address is a hashed version of the public key, and is, within reason, 100% completely and totally secure.  There is absolutely nothing that anyone could do with any known or even anticipated technology that would compromise the security of your coins by being in possession of your address.  
The public key, however, which is not normally visible, and normally would only be revealed when you spend coins, is the raw value, and is derived directly from the value of your private key.  While the are currently no known attacks that can get the private key from the public key (that's the whole point of public key cryptography), it is possible that sometime in the future, someone may come up with a way to compromise the private key from a known public key, either cryptographically through some unknown mathematical attack, or by pseudo-brute-force, via something like quantum computing.  Therefore, the recommended practice is that any time you spend any coins associated with an address (which reveals the public key for that address), you should spend ALL coins associated with that address, and send any remainder to a new address.  The general policy of not allowing addresses to be reused for multiple transactions, enforced by most modern wallets, achieves this by default.  If you deliberately re-use an address for something like ongoing donations, you have to be aware of this issue and deal with it manually.

As with everything in security, it is always a trade-off between convenience and security.  When dealing with software that can potentially hold massive amounts of people's wealth, it is understandable that providers err on the side of security.  The problem with something like a SHA checksum is that it is trivial for someone to set up a malicious spoof site for the software, checksum their hacked software and include that checksum on the page, and people verify that checksum... yup, checks out, must be safe.  And of course, it isn't.
Electrum (and many other software packages in the crypto space) uses GPG (PGP) public key cryptographic signatures, because only ThomasV can produce a signature from his private key that is valid, so there is no way for a malicious site to fake that.  There is no question that verifying this type of signature is more complicated and involved than verifying a simple checksum, but it is worth the effort for the added security.
Reddit user baltakatei has produced a fantastic [tutorial]( on PGP key management and signature verification that you can use to get up to speed on this stuff.  It's well worth your time to learn it, as it will apply in the long run to more things than just Electrum.

Go to 
Scroll down and look at the bottom chart. This chart shows the breakdown of transaction data size by fee rate.  As transactions are added to the mempool, the stacks grow.  As blocks are found, they go down, usually ~1MB, and usually from the top of the stack.
Place your mouse over the very right edge of the chart, and look at the pop-up.  Look for where the the  Data size above the rate is ~1MB.  This is the fee rate range for next block confirmation as of that instant.  If you look at it right now, that's about 160 sat/B.  If you look a little further down, you can see that it's still only 1.5MB at 120 sat/B, so that should confirm in ~2 blocks.
If you click on the 120-140 in the legend, it will hide everything below the 120 level so you can see the stuff above it more clearly.  The next level down, 100-120, is ~18MB deep.  Contrary to some of the other complete shit fee estimation sites (*cough* bitcoinfees.earn.com *cough*), there is no possible way to accurately predict how long transaction in those deeper fee bands could take.  18MB deep, you know it's going to be at least 3+ hours, if no new transactions arrived, which is of course not a reasonable assumption.  Or it could be days if lots of new transactions come in.  Going into even lower bands makes any possibility of estimating even more inaccurate.  So as of right now, I would personally specify a rate of 120-140 sat/B, and expect a confirmation within a few blocks at most.  Even that's not 100%, but it's a pretty reasonable bet.

Showing the absolute amount of fee you paid is meaningless without knowing the size of your transaction in bytes.  For a typical ~225 byte 1 input, 2 output transaction, the fee above is an absurd 1561 satoshis/byte, over 10 times the required fee for next block confirmation.  A transaction made up of 20 dust inputs at 3.5KB total size would be 100 sat/B and probably would be days or more before it is confirmed.  Absolute value is meaningless.  It's sat/B that matters.

The single transaction is the "coinbase" transaction.  This is the special first transaction in a block that awards the current block reward (12.5 BTC) + the fees from the other transactions in the block (in this case, 0, obviously) to the miner.

OK, since you're not interested in the details, I'll give you an answer that I'm not at all confident isn't wrong on some of the major details, but should give you a general idea of what's happening.  Hopefully I don't misrepresent anything too badly.
First of all, you are hopefully aware that it is a property of public key cryptography that data that is encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the public key (and, in general, vice versa, although &lt;technical detail handwavery&gt;).
When the transaction is created, an input(s) with an appropriate amount of coin is selected.  Once all the data of the transaction is prepared, a selected subset of that data is hashed, and that hashed value is used with the private key for the input(s) to create the signature(s).  The signatures and corresponding public keys are included in the transaction.
On the receiving side, the same subset of the transaction's data is hashed, and that hashed value is used with the signature(s) and the public key(s) to check the validity of the signatures.  Since it is a property of the cryptographic system that only the public key can decrypt data encrypted with the private key, if the signature verifies, it is known with certainty that the signature was made with the private key, and thus whoever created the transaction is authorized to spend those coins.
You can find a still extremely technically detailed but much more comprehensive discussion of ECDSA signatures than the one on the wiki in [Chapter 6]( of Andreas's Mastering Bitcoin 2nd Edition.
I am at the same time both concerned that this seems obvious to me, but perhaps it's not to you, and also that I've somehow still been horribly unclear.  I'm sure as hell no Andreas, able to explain these complex topics in simple terms.  Hopefully it helped.

You should certainly be concerned that you are doing business with a company that is unafraid of committing blatant fraud.  That's what you get, however, for dealing with web wallets.  You probably have no choice but to eat their fees to get your BTC back.  In future, use a proper wallet where you control the coins and the fees.

It's really kinda sad commentary that your second sentence is necessary.
Anyway, you don't *need* to back up the file after using a new address, as long as it is a "HD" wallet (which all new wallets for many versions now (0.13?) have been).  It will generate the same sequence of keys from the master private key, so it will always generate the same addresses and recognize that those addresses are in use (assuming they have transactions associated with them).  You should still do regular backups, however, because additional data such as your notes on transactions, contacts, etc. are being added to the file as you use those features, and those would be lost in the event you need to restore an old backup.  Your coins would still all be accessible, but some of that "metadata" might be lost.

OK, so first question first:  No, you do not HAVE to have 2 outputs.  If you are consuming the entire input (such as when transferring an entire balance from one wallet to another), you can have just that one (destination) output.  However, more generally, your understanding is correct.  If you are not spending the entire input, you must supply a change address, or the remainder of the input will be lost (it will go to the miner as fees).
However, moving on, with a wallet such as Electrum, you should NOT be backing up your private keys.  Electrum, like all modern wallets, discourages address re-use by using a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet, that generates a new receive address every time you want to receive, and a new change address for every change output.  It does this by using a master private key which is based on the Seed Words you were shown when you generated your wallet (and that you can see again by pressing the seed icon at the bottom of the window at any time).  It is those words that you need to safely and securely back up.  With those words, you can restore your entire wallet and every key pair and address it will ever generate.
I don't use Exodus, so I don't know what sort of wallets and key management it uses, but in general, in today's day and age, if you are using a wallet that is non-HD, you should probably upgrade to a modern wallet and move your coins to it.  Backing up individual private keys is not only an administrative hassle, it's also pretty damn hard to keep secure.

The current next block fee rate is 1 sat/B, or for a typical 1 input, 2 output non-segwit transaction, roughly 225 satoshis, or approximately 2 cents.  With segwit, less.  The text you are referencing is either a holdover from months ago when fees were higher and doesn't reflect their actual current fee, or the fee is a fee they are imposing and has absolutely nothing to do with actual bitcoin network transaction fees.

It depends on what version of the software is being run.  In version 0.14 and greater, the default mempoolexpiry is 2 weeks.  In versions prior to that, it was 3 days.  In either case, transactions are routinely rebroadcast, so it should stay around easily until confirmed, especially as that is not a particularly low fee rate.
At the moment, there are only 6ish MB of transactions in the mempool above 150 sat/B, so, barring a massive influx of higher fee transactions or excessive block time gaps, it's entirely possible that it will be confirmed in the next few hours.

There is nothing in the bitcoin transaction protocol definitions that requires a transaction to have a miner fee.  There is not even a specific field in the transaction for "fees".  Fees are simply the difference between the total inputs, and the total outputs.  If the input value exactly matches the output value, then there is no fee, and that is a perfectly valid transaction.  The fee *is optional*.  I know this for a fact, because I myself have performed numerous transactions that did not contain any fee.  Satoshi himself was quoted in the early days as his preference being that the network should always process at least some free transactions (and it did, and I fairly sure, occasionally, still does, although I can't immediately cite a specific recent example, mostly because I can't be bothered to look).
Probably one of the better ways of expressing the situation is "Bitcoin fees are optional.  A miner including your transaction in a block is also optional."
As I clearly mentioned in my post 


Which kinda renders your nitpicking of my perfectly accurate description of fees, moot.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:14:30
You have a fundamental confusion about how bitcoin addresses and bitcoin transactions work.
Addresses, change or otherwise, do not contain bitcoins.  Transactions contain bitcoin, specifically, unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) contain bitcoin.  When you spend a UTXO as an input, that UTXO is fully consumed.  You either create a change output for the difference between your actual transaction amount, and the amount of the input(s), or the difference is lost (becoming fees).  The additional change output itself becomes a UTXO.
If you receive 30 payment outputs, and 30 change outputs 
from your own transactions like that, you have 60 new UTXOs.  Whether you received all 60 of them to one address, or each one to a different address makes no difference, it's still 60 UTXOs, and if you want to aggregate them all into one at a later time, it's 60 inputs, regardless of how many unique addresses there are among those inputs.

It is impossible to say whether that fee is appropriate, because we have no idea how large the transaction is... in bytes, not BTC.
How much BTC you are sending is irrelevant.  If your 4.8mBTC was all in one input, and you are sending the entire amount (minus fees) to one address with no change (~190 bytes), then your 74950 satoshis of fees is a fee rate of almost 400 sat/B, which is exceptionally high at the moment, nearly 4 times what is required for next block confirmation.  If the 4.8 mBTC consists of numerous inputs, than the fee shown may be more reasonable, or even low, depending on how many there are.  Without knowing the actual size of the transaction, it is impossible to say.

Stop thinking about fees in terms of fiat.  The bitcoin network doesn't know or care what the fiat value of the fees you pay is.  
Also, you should probably actually learn how fees work, and that quoting fees in an absolute value like "~1mBTC" is completely useless and wrong.  Fees are paid based on the size of the data that is being stored on the blockchain, and are nearly universally quoted in satoshis per byte (sat/B), although decimal BTC or mBTC per KB is also used (the bitcoin core client uses this system).  
Saying a fee of "~1mBTC", which is 100000 satoshis, for a typical 1 input, 2 output (destination and change) transaction, ~225 bytes, is a stupidly large 444 sat/B, vastly more than would have been required to get into the very next block any time in recent weeks and months, and if you paid a fee like that, for a transaction like that today, you will have vastly overpaid.  The same "~1mBTC" for a change consolidation transaction consisting of dozens of inputs and a single output, say around 5KB, would be a much more reasonable (although possibly much slower confirming) 20 sat/B.  Same "fee", two different sized transactions, two totally different fee rates, and probably two totally different expected confirmation speeds.
Fees are the method by which users of the bitcoin network compete for timely access to the limited space on the blockchain.  If you are paying 20 sat/B for your transaction, and there are hundreds or thousands of other people, with many megabytes of transactions, paying higher than that, they are going to get their transactions processed before you.  How much these fee rates translate to in any arbitrary fiat, at any arbitrary moment, **is completely irrelevant to this process**.  All that matters to miners, is who is willing to pay the most.  All that matters to you, in terms of confirmation speed, is how many people are willing to pay more than you, in relative terms.
Finally, the SegWit2x hard fork, if it happens at all, is not "coming up" until approximately November.  Segwit in the bitcoin network however, activates next week.  This will have the benefit that SegWit transactions will, on average, based on what I have heard of the testing, increase the usable space in a block from 1MB to approximately 1.7MB of transaction data.  This will probably have an effect of lowering fees, at least short term, as more transactions can be fit into one block, increasing the amount of space being competed for, and resulting in more transactions being confirmed in a shorter amount of time.  With less competition for space, fees should fall, but this is speculative, and remains to be seen.

Please see my reply to the top post on this thread.  The *number* of unconfirmed transactions is irrelevant and completely useless for estimating anything.  More details in the reply above.
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:12:53
Please note that the *number* of unconfirmed transactions is an almost completely useless metric, and is most certainly completely useless for estimating either the expected time to confirm, or an appropriate fee rate for a given time.
The only useful metric for these uses is mempool *data size* by fee rate, which is what is shown on the bottom graph at   With this chart, you can see exactly how many MB of data is at each fee rate level, and more important, how much of it is above your rate.  If you click on the legend for the range your fee is in, it will hide everything below you, and you can more clearly see what is above you.  Each block (should, but doesn't necessarily always) consumes roughly 1MB of transactions, usually mostly off the top of the stack.  So if there are 10MB of transactions above your rate in the pool, it will take at least 10 blocks before it gets down to you, and that doesn't account for any new transactions coming in in the mean time.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:46:14
Your "master" seed, or private key, is not ever shared anywhere, with anyone or used for transactions.  The master key is used to generate a series of individual private keys and their corresponding public keys and addresses, which are then used for your transactions.  The same seed will always generate the same set of keys in the same order, so the seed can be used to recreate your wallet and all the addresses it ever has or ever will contain.

In bitcoin prior to version 0.14, the mempool was not preserved across reboots, so presumably the node that is used to produce this graph is running a previous version and was rebooted.

Doing so would have revealed that no such drop actually occurred anywhere else.

The network is so busy because of the massive amounts of interest in bitcoin that the massive new all time high fiat prices and extensive media coverage surrounding the Segwit activation battle generated.  You can still get a transaction to go through in 20 minutes (give or take, averages and variance, blah blah blah), you just have to pay a much higher fee rate to get it.
The 10% was just an estimate, and should not be taken as an example of an appropriate fee at any given moment.  I hesitated to even quote something like "10%", because fees are not ever any percentage of the value of the transaction... the value of the transactoin has nothing to do with it... just the size.  The only point that I was trying to make is if you are concerned with the fiat values of your transactions and your fees (which really, you shouldn't be), if you're doing small-ish transactions like $50, at the moment, an appropriate fee for a typical sized transaction for immediate confirmation is going to work out to be $4-5, so at the moment, it is a really bad value proposition to do transactions of that size with those fees. 
In order to determine an appropriate fee, you need to know the size of the transaction in bytes, and a appropriate fee rate based on how long you expect it to take to confirm, which is far from an exact science.  Many wallets have dynamic fee rate estimation, all of them suck, most of them either over-estimate the required fees (most often, and badly), or under-estimate them leading to slow confirmations.
As for transaction expiry, it depends on what software a given node is running.  Older software expires transactions from the mempool after 3 days, but for newer software, it is 2 weeks.  Transactions are also routinely re-broadcast, so in general, your transaction is extremely unlikely to expire before it confirms, likely at the latest, on the weekend.  Fee rates will likely be much more reasonable on the weekend as well, so unless your transactions are urgent, I'd certainly encourage you to wait.  The smaller your transactions, BTC wise, the more I'd encourage it.

Addresses do not contain coins.  Transactions contain coins.  Transactions reference addresses.  Addresses (specifically the cryptographic keys associated with an address) identify you as authorized to spend the coins in transactions that reference that address.  Specifically, what you spend is a UTXO, an Unspent Transaction Output.  Since you can (but usually shouldn't) conduct multiple transactions to a particular address, it is possible for multiple UTXOs to reference that address.  When you spend three inputs, you are spending 3 UTXOs, and what address those UTXOs were sent to, whether they are the same or different, doesn't matter.

1/ Fees are by definition always optional, but the chances you will get your transaction processed with no fee these days is essentially zero, so yes, all transactions incur a transaction fee.  The fee is expressed as a certain number of satoshis per byte, and is based on the data size of your transaction.  So a transaction that spends one input and sends it to one output will cost less than a transaction that spends 5 inputs and sends it to 2 outputs (destination and change).
2/  As mentioned above, the fee is dependent on the data size of the transaction, which is dependent on the number and size of the inputs and outputs.  The number of unique addresses represented in those inputs and outputs does not matter.  So a 3 input transaction where all 3 inputs are from the same address will cost the same (more or less, within a few satoshis) of a 3 input transaction where all 3 inputs come from different addresses.

Define "accurate".  There is no one universal bitcoin price in US dollars (or any other fiat currency).  It depends on what exchange you ask, and no price is "accurate" until you actually go and make a transaction on a specific exchange.  Is it roughly in the right ballpark, to a couple of 1/10s of an mBTC?  Yes, probably.
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:13:27
.000022 is 2200 satoshis.  Assuming a relatively normal 1 input 2 output transaction (destination and change, ~225 bytes), that would be roughly 10 sat/B.  If there is only one output (destination, no change, input is completely consumed), that would be more like ~190 bytes, and a slightly higher fee rate around 11.5 sat/B.
At this exact moment, network traffic is heavier than normal, and the currently required fee rate to get into the next block is approximately 135-140 sat/B.   There are currently approximately 14MB of transactions at a fee rate higher than 10 sat/B.  So... it's probably going to be a while.  Several hours at least, possibly as much as days, depending on how many new transactions continue to come in at a rate higher than your relatively low fee.  The chances are very high, however, that it will clear at some point on the weekend, as the mempool has typically been completely emptying on weekends lately.
A better site for seeing the current state of the mempool is the bottom graph at   Put your cursor on the right edge of the graph, and look at the "10+" number.  That is how many MB of transactions remain above 10 sat/B.  When that number drops to something less than 1MB, your transaction either will have been processed, or will be processed in the next block or two.

I don't see why, no, as long as the transactions you are verifying are newer than your block history.  The validation of the inputs of the transaction will have been done at mining time, so all you need is to see the transaction and blocks built on top of it for confirmation.
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:56:06
Assuming all your numbers are right, 20000 satoshis / 260 bytes = 76.9 sat/B.  As you can see from the bottom chart at  the current next block fee rate is ~220 sat/B, and there are currently ~12MB of transactions at a fee level of 80+. If you look back through some of the longer time frames, you can see that it has not reached into the 60-80 range since the weekend.  Overnight last night it managed to reach into the 100-120 band a bit, and taking small pieces occasionally from lower bands (see 24h graph), so it's possible, but by no means guaranteed, that it might get to it overnight.  At the very worst, it will almost certainly clear out on the weekend, where generally everything down to 5 sat/B and sometimes lower usually gets confirmed.
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:58:32
Your fee rate of ~25 sat/B is roughly 1/10th of what is currently required for timely confirmation, and roughly 1/6th of the lowest fee rate that has received confirmation in the last 12 hours.


Yes, there is a reason.  The network is incredibly busy.  Which means if you want your transaction confirmed quickly, you would have had to pay a substantially higher fee rate than normal.  From the sounds of it, I doubt your wallet even has that capability, given that it set your fees to a flat .1 mBTC, in complete disregard for the size of the transaction or the current fee climate.
Now is not the time to be doing non-essential transactions for small amounts of bitcoin unless you are prepared to wait quite a while... like... until the weekend, probably.  Or get it in a timely manner, having paid ~10% of your transaction's value in fees.  Your choice.  Or in your case, actually not your choice... your wallet's choice, and your wallet appears to have chosen a fee rate that will probably make you wait until the weekend.

Yes, if somehow, two different miners were to test a hash with exactly the same parameters, they would produce the same hash.  The chances of this happening, however, are incredibly tiny.  I'm not sure exactly how tiny.  It's also worth noting that the the difficulty of finding a valid hash is so high, that the vast majority of them are found by mining "pools", of hundreds to thousands of machines, each of which are attempting trillions of hashes every second.  That's what a single miner with a few million or billion hashes per second is competing against.  And the key is, they have to find a valid hash *before* anyone else does.  Once a valid hash is found and a new block produced, everyone has to start over, because the "fixed" data changes.

I wouldn't recommend this, personally.  If you can, I would move the block data files into the VM.  I just recently did more or less the same move, moving my block repository from a windows based bitcoin-qt install, to a ubuntu bitcoind install in a VM, and the blocks moved fine.  I did have to re-index though.  I had the disc space to make a big drive for bitcoin (for /home, actually, where ~bitcoin/.bitcoin lives) and scp the files up, and then I deleted them off the windows drive to free the space after I verified they were working on the new install.

Your transactions have extremely low fee rates of 56 and 80 sat/B, and the second one is spending the unconfirmed output of the first.

Fees are optional, by definition.  I have numerous transactions in my transaction history that paid no fee, although, obviously, they were not recently.  The minimum relay fee of .00001 is the default.  There is nothing stopping a node from setting it lower or a mining node from accepting a zero fee transaction and mining it themselves (for example, for a pool member or paying business customer).  As I said in my post, the are *by definition* optional, but the chance of getting a zero fee transaction processed are near zero, for numerous reasons, including the minimum relay fee setting.

As has already been pointed out, simply moving them into the same address, or even the same wallet, does NOT combine them into one output, and if you want to spend them all, you are going to pay fees appropriate to spending all of those inputs.  If you want to consolidate them, you will still have to pay those fees, but after that, you will have a single output you can spend cheaply.  There is, however, absolutely no reason to involve coinbase in that process.  You can just send them to yourself to consolidate them.

Your fees are quite generous at 231 sat/B.  There is currently about 4MB of transactions above you in the mempool.  You can see this by using the bottom chart at  and click on the "220-240" on the legend (the range your fee rate is in) to hide everything below you on the chart.  Your transaction is about in the middle of the bottom purple band, around the 1000 line, and as I write this, there is a total of about 5000 kB at that rate band and above, so about 4000 above you.  Each new block found removes about 1000 kB from the pool, usually from the top, but new transactions are always coming in.  So it will be at least 4-5 blocks before you have a chance to be confirmed, longer, the more that comes in.  You can monitor that chart, and when the new blocks being found eats down into roughly the middle of that bottom purple band, you will be confirmed.
*edit to add:* It would appear that there is BCH EDA fuckery in progress again at the moment, so that may further slow down the rate of new BTC blocks being found somewhat, increasing the time before you get confirmed.

That is a perfectly reasonable premium for a BTM.  It's a business, not a charity, and it is NOT a bank ATM when you can just withdraw $20 for $20 from your account.  
Look at it this way.  Take the minimum transaction value of $60, at the quoted price, they are selling you ~7.222mBTC.  The actual cost of 7.222mBTC at the moment is $51.26.  So their profit on that transaction is $8.74, or a profit margin of 17%.  This is a completely reasonable margin for any sensible profit seeking business.  Out of that 17% they have to pay all of their costs... the cost of the machine, the power, the networking, cost of driving back and forth to service it, probably rent to the store where it is located, the transaction fees, etc. etc. etc.  And of course... profit.  The people running the machine are doing so to make money, not to sell you bitcoin at cost.  You are paying a premium for convenience.  There is absolutely nothing unusual about any of this.

Yup, well... $20 anyway, you wouldn't pay 360 sat/B, because that would surely be overpaying.  At the time I wrote that, 190 would have gotten you near next block confirmation, so you'd definitely be paying a premium for the fast confirmation time, given that the network is busy.  It's actually gone up a bit since then, but nowhere near 360.
Your 2.8mBTC on an 1800 byte transaction comes out to ~155 sat/B, which is still pretty high, in the grand scheme of things, but at the moment, there's about 7MB of transactions above that rate in the mempool, so even at that, it would probably take a couple of quiet hours at least.
In general these days, if you're not in a hurry and can wait, for example moving your coins between wallets, doing dust consolidations, etc... it's best to wait till the weekends, when it is generally much quieter, and use a good fee rate breakdown chart like the bottom chart at [johoe's]( to get a feel for the current best rates and the general trend.   If you can't wait, and it's busy, as it often is these days, then ya, you'll have to pay premium fees, and yes, that does make sending small amounts, or even moderate amounts with many inputs (large data size) expensive, perhaps impractically so.

Read the text at the bottom of the page.  The chart that is useful for fee estimation is the bottom one, which shows the data size by fee rate for transactions currently in the mempool.  Each new block found (usually) removes approximately 1MB from (usually) the top of the stack of transactions.  Looking at the chart right now, if you hover your mouse over the very right edge of the graph, you can see that there are 1MB (1 block worth) of transactions paying 160 sat/B or more.  There are 2MB (2 blocks worth) paying 50 sat/B or more.  There are roughly 5MB (5 blocks worth) paying 10 sat/B or more.  The total mempool at the moment is ~45MB.  Of course, new transactions are coming in all the time, so it is an ebb and flow.  Observing this chart multiple times over even a brief period can allow you to determine how the fee rates are flowing and make generally very accurate estimations based on how long you're prepared to wait.

At some point in time, your transaction will be mined and included into a block.  That is the first confirmation of your transaction.  After that happens, 5 additional blocks will need to be mined above the block that contains your transaction, for a total of 6 confirmations.  Your funds will not be available to you to trade with until the 6th confirmation is received.  If blocks were being found exactly on the average of 1 every 10 minutes (which they never are, there is variance in both directions, 3 blocks in 5 minutes, or an hour between blocks), that would mean your funds would be available approximately 1 hour after your transaction was initially mined.

There is no need to involve coinbase in the transaction at all.  Just send all of your coins, from multiple inputs, to one new output / address in your own wallet.  You'll still have to pay the (presumably large) transaction fees for all of the inputs, but you don't need to pay any fees to move coins into or back out of coinbase.  Just send them to yourself.  This is commonly referred to as a "consolidation transaction" or "dust consolidation".  And as mentioned, it's best to wait until the network is at its least busy, usually on weekends, in order to get the lowest possible fee rate.

The short answer is, probably yes, but it depends.  If the seed words use the BIP39 standard, then yes, they are interchangable with any wallet that uses BIP39.  One notable wallet, Electrum, uses a seed word system that is not based on BIP39.  You can import a BIP39 seed into Electrum, but not the other way around... you can't import Electrum seed words into a BIP39 wallet.  If Electrum ever fell out of use, presumably there would be tools created to work around this limitation.  Perhaps there already are, I don't know.

The number of transactions total in the mempool is completely and utterly irrelevant.
A slightly less irrelevant, but still pretty irrelevant number is the number of transactions in the mempool above your fee rate of 50 sat/B.  Which at the moment is about 15.5K, vastly less than half of the total transactions in the pool.
A truly useful number is the *data size* of the transactions in the mempool above your fee rate, which at the moment, is approximately 7 MB.  You can see this [here](  Look at the bottom chart, and click on the 50-60 in the legend to hide everything below your fee level.  Downward movement on that chart are blocks being found, and each one removes (usually) about 1MB (usually) from the top of the stack.  New transactions above your fee rate grow the stack, of course.  When blocks being found eat their way down to the bottom of that chart (with the 50-60 filter on) your transaction will be confirmed.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:06:43
It is impossible say whether that is "normal" without knowing the size of the transaction (and thus the fee rate) and without taking into account the current state of the mempool.  If you configure the transaction for sending and press "Preview", it will show you all of the size and rate details.  If it's a standard-ish 225ish byte transaction, then yes, that is an extremely high fee rate.  If it's 20KB of dust, then not so much.
Right now, my electrum (which is connected to my personal electrumx server and it to my core node), is giving me a low recommended fee of 190ish sat/B, and a high fee of 360ish sat/B.  190ish, interestingly, is actually pretty close to being right for next block-ish confirmation at the moment.  In general, I never allow wallets to set the fee rate.  I always look it up and set it optimally according to my needs, by hand.

Yup.  It may seem slow, but guaranteed, it's faster than it would have been without the raised cache limit.  It will get slower the higher up the blockchain you get.  In the early days, almost all blocks were mostly empty of transactions.  These days, almost all blocks are completely full, so the overhead of processing them is much greater.  The improvement from the cache is more pronounced the higher into the blockchain you get and the more work it has to do per block.

Nodes are not votes.  It is not decided by a majority of node count.  There is no "there" to get.  Running a node is meaningless unless you're performing transactions through it. I don't know how I can possibly make this clearer.  Nothing is counted.  It is not a democracy. 
Unless someone is actively using the network to perform transactions, it is meaningless.  There could be 10000 nodes servicing 100s of thousands of bitcoin network transactions, and 100000 nodes servicing a few hundred forked network transactions.  Guess which one is bitcoin?  The fact that their nodes outnumber real bitcoin 10:1 is irrelevant.  If everyone is actually running forked software and doing their transactions through it, then obviously, there is a consensus, and I'm not sure why this is a debate.  If there is a mix, there are 2 separate networks.  Although some may be trying, IMO it is disingenuous to call the new one "bitcoin" when there was no consensus.  They're welcome to keep their forked coin.  A majority may even like it better, and use it instead of bitcoin, but it's still not bitcoin.  At this point, frankly, you seem to be arguing for the sake of arguing, and I have better things to do with my time.  Good luck in your learning.

None of them are "correct".  They are all "estimates" or "predictions", and they all have assumptions built in and time span ranges for the prediction data that can considerably bias the results.  For example, earlier today another BCH EDA event started, where between 2 and 2.5 EH/s moved from the BTC chain to the BCH chain.  Estimations that bias to a shorter timespan, and assume that data from that timespan will apply evenly over the remaining 900ish blocks until the next re-targeting, are going to over-estimate the amount of reduction in the difficulty if and when that hashrate returns to the BTC chain in 3 or so days. 
 [Fork.lol]( has yet another number putting the reduction at ~-16%.  My guess is that's probably closer to the truth than the seemingly excessive ~-24% of bitcoinwisdom and the seemingly pessimistic estimates of ~+1% and ~-4% at the other 2sites.

Running a node does not give you a "say" in the way you mean it.  You run a node so that you know for certain what bitcoin network you are connecting to and what consensus rules the software is enforcing.  Running a node is first and foremost for *your* benefit, not anyone else's.


Running a node does not give you a "say" in anything, so running more nodes does not give you more "say".


Qua bitcoin, they don't.  It's an open source project.  They all freely contribute to it.  That's how open source works.  Many of the people involved in the project also work for a variety of companies who are involved in crypto technology, and no doubt their contributions to bitcoin development probably helped them land those jobs, but that is completely separate from the development of bitcoin itself.


It is an open source project.  All of the code is freely visible to everyone, and there are literally thousands of highly skilled programmers looking at the code constantly.  "Putting in malicious code" without anyone noticing is effectively impossible.

Very few wallets (including core) understand the Bech32 native segwit addresses that Electrum uses.  They're too new.  You will either have to use a standard wallet in electrum (you can then send them from your electrum standard wallet to your electrum segwit wallet, because electrum understands bech32 just fine, but it will be an additional separate transaction), or supposedly there is a way to generate P2SH segwit addresses externally and import them into Electrum, but I'm not sure on the details of that.
Personally, since I'm not transacting frequently, I've just left my coins in a standard wallet and I'm going to wait until bech32 support is more widespread before moving my coins to a segwit wallet.

It is an important concept to understand, that your bitcoins don't ever "go" anywhere.  The only place your bitcoins are, the only place they will ever be, is on the blockchain, ledger entries in an immutable distributed database stored on 10s of thousands of computers around the world.  Your bitcoins are not "in" your wallet.  What is in a hardware wallet, or any wallet, are cryptographic keys.  The keys are used to make addresses.  Addresses identify the destination for coins on the ledger.  The keys prove you are the owner of and control an address, and the coins associated with it.
So to "send" your coins to your hardware wallet, you perform a transaction like any other transaction, with an address from your wallet as the destination.

Running a node does not give you a vote on anything.  Mining does not give you a vote on anything.  Bitcoin is not a democracy.  Changes to bitcoin are not decided by votes.  They are decided by consensus.  Unless you can convince everyone (or near enough everyone, anyway) that what you are trying to do is the right thing to do, it doesn't happen.  This is not a bug, it's a feature.  People who disagree are free to fork the bitcoin code, make their new chain anyway, and try to get people to run their software instead.  That is what a hard-fork/chain split is.  Since they couldn't get consensus in the first place, usually, the end effect of this attempt is failure (or at least irrelevancy), but sometimes the forked coins can survive on their own.  They are not, however, Bitcoin.

Change.  Bitcoins are contained in UTXOs, Unspent Transaction Outputs.  When you spend a UTXO, you spend the entire thing.  If the amount that you are sending to your recipient is less than the value of the UTXO(s), (which it almost always would be), then there needs to be an additional output to receive the left over amount.  That address is another address within your wallet, and for privacy reasons, will change every time.

If you found it later, and it was undamaged and still functional, it would contain the same seed / keys that it originally did.  Assuming you recovered your seed on another device, and then created a new wallet with a new seed and sent the coins to an address in the new wallet (to protect against theft if your original device was stolen), then there would be no coins left associated with the keys on the newly found device.  You could just re-initialize it and use it again, if you wish.  Remember:  Wallets do not hold coins, they hold keys.

Like everything else in Bitcoin, YOU are ultimately responsible for ensuring the security and integrity of your connections and transactions with the bitcoin network.  Electrum will allow you to select which server you conduct transactions with.  You can and should connect to a server you know is connected to a Core node and disable auto-select.
Ultimately, if you want to be as safe as possible, you should run your own core node, your own electrumx server connected to that core node, and electrum with the `--oneserver` option, connected only to that server.  If you don't do that, you'll have to trust someone else that has.

Wallets (and hard drives) do not store coins.  They store keys.  If you store your keys in a hardware wallet, you have a passcode.  If you store your keys in a software wallet, the wallet is (optionally) encrypted with a password.  Without the passcode or password, no one can access your keys, and therefore cannot access your coins.
Restoring your keys with your seed words restores the keys to a new device or application.  Once restored, if you suspect that someone else has access to a wallet with your keys (even protected/encrypted), you can then make a new wallet with a new seed and send your coins to it, and they are safely yours alone again.  If someone did gain access to your wallet, however, by knowing your passcode or password, then yes, they could send your coins elsewhere, and then they are gone.  Restoring your seed would restore a set of keys that no longer have any coins associated with them.

Your address probably starts with "bc1".  It is a bech32 segwit native address.  Bech32 is new, and most wallets, including coinbase, do not support bech32 yet, so it does not recognize the address as valid.
Create an additional new standard wallet in your electrum (File-&gt;New, Standard, New Seed, Standard), open that wallet and send to an address in that wallet.  If you want to later send from that wallet to your segwit wallet, you can do that as Electrum understands how to send to a bech32 address just fine (but it will require an additional transaction.  You should be able to do it relatively inexpensively if you wait until fees are low).

If you are not spending your coins, there is absolutely no reason to move them.  There is no danger of any kind that standard P2PKH addresses will stop working, ever.  Segwit is an expansion of the bitcoin address space, not a replacement.  It is more secure for transactions, more space efficient, and enables other technologies.  If you want or need any of those features, then you have reason to move your coins to a Segwit address.  For long term cold storage, none of those matter.

It's always dubious to think about fees in terms of fiat, because the bitcoin value of a given amount of fiat is constantly changing.  Your 7323 satoshis might be 33.5 cents at $4500 per bitcoin, but when a bitcoin was $2250, it was only 17 cents, and when a bitcoin is $10000, it will be 70 cents.  Still 7323 satoshis though, and still a 32 sat/B fee rate, regardless of how much that works out to in dollars.
But in general, yes, you have the basic math right.  226 bytes is also the right number for a transaction that has 1 input, and 2 outputs, (destination and change).  If your transaction has more or less inputs or outputs then the size will change accordingly.  It's important to understand that in bitcoin, you don't have a "balance".  It's not one aggregate number.  Each transaction that you've received is a separate bit of coin, and if you have to use multiple bits of coin to make up enough to cover how much you're trying to send, that will make the transaction, and the fees, larger.  You're always paying for how much space you're actually going to use for your transaction on the blockchain.
It's also important to understand (contrary to how terribly so many wallets display this information), that "slow" and "fast" are relative to what's going on in the mempool at any given moment.  For example, right now, because its the weekend, and things are not busy, the mempool is virtually empty, and 32 sat/B would effectively guarantee you that you would get into the next block.  Super fast.  10 sat/B would probably confirm in 1-2 blocks even.  However, at the peak heaviest times in the week, even 280 sat/B may not be enough to be "fast".  That fee rate may wait hours... dozens of blocks, and 32 sat/B may wait all week until things are quiet on the weekend again.  It depends.  You always have to look and take into account what's actually happening.

They abandon their current work (or pool share, if mining in a pool) and start again from scratch with new work configured for the next block.


The mining node that received the newly created block verifies it, and then passes it on to all the nodes who are connected to it, who then also verify it, and each pass it on to each of the nodes connected to them, and so on and so on until the new block has propagated to the entire network.
Note that it is entirely possible for 2 miners to find a block simultaneously, or nearly so, and both claim to have found a block at the same height.  This causes a temporary chain split, which will be resolved when the next block is mined, depending on which of the two actually gets built on.  The other will be orphaned.  This is a fairly rare event.  The last time it happened was January 12th.

Short of that level of incompatible change, or some sort of major bug being found, I see little reason (and plenty of risk) to upgrading.

Mining bitcoin does not get harder over time.  Mining bitcoin gets harder the more power there is mining bitcoin.  As hash power is added to the network, difficulty goes up.  If hash power is removed from the network, difficulty goes down.  If it gets to the point where difficulty rises, and price does not, such that it becomes economically unaffordable for some miners to continue to mine, then they will stop mining, and the difficulty will lower to accommodate the lower amount of available hash power.  In theory, this leads to an equilibrium somewhere.

The only graph that has any value for fee estimation is the bottom one.  The top two provide interesting trivia information if you're interested in such things, but they are meaningless from the perspective of fee estimation.
First of all, I would recommend resetting the graph to use the 2 hour view, rather than 24 hour.  Placing your cursor at the very right edge shows the size statistics for right now (more or less).  Since you know that (usually) a block will consume 1MB of data (usually) off the top, you can look down the list to where the number goes over 1000kB.  That is the "line".  If a block was found right this minute, all (most) of the transactions above that line would be included in the block, so that's (roughly) where you'd have to set your fee rate to get included in the next block... but...
First of all, just to get it out of the way, segwit will start to increasingly mess with this, by having the number be larger than 1MB.  Right now it's only a few KB extra per block, but over time, that will grow until blocks may be 1.5-1.7MB or possibly even more.  Secondly, of course, there's no guarantee that a block will be found "right now".  Or soon.  Or even not soon.  Variance happens, and the longer that passes between blocks, the more transactions will be added on to the pile above yours.  The closer you cut "the line", the greater the chance of variance in block times or sudden spikes or higher fee rate transactions screwing you.
For deeper estimations, or lets say you aren't in a hurry, and picked a rate near the middle (or bottom) of the pile.  You can use the same principles to estimate (roughly) how many blocks need to be found before it gets to yours.  Let's say you have a transaction at X sat/B, and there are 7000kB of transactions above that rate in the pool.  You can estimate that it will be at least 7 blocks before your transaction clears, but you have to account for the fact that there are always new transactions coming in, and still there's variance and whatnot.
If you spend some time just watching that chart, you will very quickly get a feel for how the pool is ebbing and flowing at any given moment, and you should, in general, be able to make much more accurate fee estimations than any of the automated estimation sites.

It's actually fairly accurate, although it depends on the key fetched from the MIT pgp key archive actually being Thomas's key.  It is.  You can verify this because the key is also linked on the electrum website's download page.  That presumes that the link on the website is valid... etc.
There is a concept in PGP of "web of trust", where you can depend on knowing the validity of some number of keys to establish trust in a key that is trusted by those keys.  A [fuller procedure]( for establishing this trust is available, but it's essentially the same as above, just with less presumptions and more reliable presumptions about the origins of keys.

The "vertical lines", showing downward movement in the graph, are indeed new blocks being found.  Each one removes some transactions from the pool. The graph is useful because it shows the *size* of the transactions waiting, and the size being removed as each block is found.  Because blocks are (relatively) fixed size (~1MB), you can use this information to estimate how much will be removed by the next block, or how many blocks are needed to remove a given amount.


It just makes the data more current.  A zoomed out longer term view is interesting to look at in its own right, but less useful for fee estimation.


No, it has nothing to do with segwit2x.  Segwit2x is a contentious hard fork on the bitcoin network that at this point has almost nothing to do with segwit.  The segwit technology is active on the main bitcoin network right now, and has been for a little more than a week, so it's still very new.  As wallets and services are updated to use segwit, and people update their wallets and addresses to use it, it will enable more transactions to be put in each block, making the effective blocksize larger than 1MB.  Segwit2x is not required for any of that.


No, there's no way you can predict exactly when a block will be found, or when a long gap between blocks will occur.  It's random (within a given amount of mining power... if a lot of miners suddently disappeared, obviously blocks would take longer, on average, and if there was a sudden influx of mining power, they would be quicker, on average, until the next difficulty adjustment).


Actually 1000KB... normal human being Ks and Ms, instead of computer Ks and Ms.


If you're trying to get 7MB of transactions processed, then yes, it will take roughly 7 blocks to hold it... give or take.


Correct.  The entire system is specifically geared for a block to take 10 minutes to find, on average.  Every 2016 blocks, the network adjusts the "difficulty", so that if blocks are being found faster than that, it gets harder to find one, and if they're getting found slower, it gets easier, in an effort to always try and keep it around 10 minutes, on average.  But sometimes things are not average.  This is known in statistics as "variance".
As for mining, I'll skip those questions.  Mining, at this point in bitcoin's history, is an industrial activity done only on huge scales by organizations and groups using thousands of special purpose machines each doing trillions of hashing operations per second.  Individual users using CPUs and even graphics cards are not capable of really contributing anything to it any more.

There are currently approximately 9MB of transactions above yours in the mempool.  Now that the BCH EDA nonsense is over (for now), and hashrate starts coming back to the BTC chain, the mempool should start getting cleared out.  The weekend will help as well.  It will clear, probably later tonight, but almost for sure at some point over the weekend.

Energy is always a factor, period.  Even if you think you're getting your solar power for "free", you're not.  Panels (and you'd need dozens) cost money.  Batteries cost money.  Inverters cost money. The control systems cost money.  Installing and wiring all that stuff, especially in conjunction with grid power for backup, costs money.  All of these components wear out and must be replaced, and some of them require regular maintenance.  You MUST account for these costs, or you are just deluding yourself about how much money you are making.  You may be able to do these things at "cost", but they are NOT "free".
The ugly reality that the "green" power industry works hard to hide, is that green power is many times MORE expensive on a TCO basis than any other kind of power.  For people who want to pay extra to push an ideology, that's fine... for people who are actually looking for cheap power for something like mining, it is completely useless.

There is no global mempool in bitcoin.  Each node maintains their own copy.  Prior to version 0.14, the mempool was not saved on restart, so if the node that website's block explorer is connected to was rebooted, it may temporarily not have any particular transaction in it.  In general, when something like this happens, you should always re-confirm the transaction in one or more other blockchain explorers to verify.  For example, the [blockchain.info]( explorer is showing the transaction just fine.

There is a value in the block header called the "nonce", that is basically just a throwaway 32 bit value, so for any given block configuration, a miner can try about 4 billion different hashes just by incrementing the nonce from 0 to ffffffff.  If they run out of nonces, then ya, they have to change something else about the block.  Changing which transactions are included, or even just the order of the same transactions, is certainly a valid strategy.

For the most part, no, it does not matter what address type your coins are in.  If there was a hypothetical fork where the other side of the fork removed or did not support segwit transactions and UTXOs, then obviously that would be a problem, but that is not the case with upcoming forks.  You will have your UTXOs on both sides, regardless of address type.

You could certainly ask your employer to pay you every month to a new address.  This would allow your landlord to see your monthly "paycheck", but your landlord probably knows that already, since it would have been on your rental application / credit check.
Privacy and security are always a trade-off between convenience and enhancement.  Only you can decide, in any particular usage case, which is more important to you.  In the case of splitting up what is effectively a single amount such as a monthly salary payment deliberately into smaller payments for isolation, there is also a cost involved, probably for the employer, as each transaction's fees must be paid.  This might act as a discouraging factor to them being willing to do so, or they might require you to eat the fees if that's what you want.

The TL;DR answer to this question is:  If you have to ask here, then "no".
The longer answer is, you will need to figure out how to get the bitcoin core software compiled for the ARM processor the router uses, which probably means figuring out how to cross-compile it on another linux machine and move the binaries and supporting files to the router.  You will also probably have to run some sort of 3rd party OS on the router like DD-WRT or Tomato to give you access to a full, SSH'able linux environment on the router so you can install stuff.  I don't think the native ASUS OS gives you this level of access.  Obviously you also need to know a decent amount about linux systems admin to know how to install and configure this stuff. 
 Even if you managed all of this, I have no idea how well it would perform.  Bitcoin core, especially during the initial blockchain download, wants a decent amount of memory, more than most routers have (256MB in this case, and the router needs some).  So longer answer:  "no".

"legit cloud mining opportunity" is an oxymoron.
@_date: 2017-09-03 02:33:41


A bitcoin transaction consists of a number of inputs, sources of coins, and outputs, destinations for coins.  Every coin you own is an output from someone's transaction (sometimes, your own).  Each of these outputs is known as a UTXO, an unspent transaction output.  If someone sends you 0.01 BTC, that's 1 UTXO.  If someone else sends you 0.01 BTC, that's another UTXO.  You have 0.02 BTC, but you really don't, you have 2 x 0.01 BTC.  And so on, for every transaction where you receive some coins.
Now, if you want to send 0.015 BTC to someone, you will have to spend BOTH of your UTXOs.  That's 2 inputs.  And you'll be sending the 0.015 to someone, that's an output.  But when you spend an input, the entire input is consumed, so the entire 0.02 BTC from both inputs is consumed.  To get the leftover 0.005 BTC back, you need another output, for "change", that output goes back to your own wallet (in modern wallets, always on a new, different address).  So that's now 2 inputs, and 2 outputs.  The actual numbers can vary a few bytes here and there, but in general, that's going to be 2 x 148(ish) bytes for the inputs + 2 x 34 bytes for the outputs + 10 overhead = 374 bytes for that transaction.  (note:  There are a ton of assumptions in those numbers.  Any decent wallet will show you the exact inputs and outputs, and the exact size in bytes, before you send the transaction, usually in a "preview" screen or similar.)


Yes, and that is in fact exactly what you do.  This is commonly referred to as a "consolidation" transaction. [here's an example](  This is a transaction consolidating 0.3BTC from dozens of small inputs (with one extra even tinier bit left over).  Even at a fee rate of ~5 sat/B, this transaction, which was a bit over 30KB in total size, cost 1.5mBTC in fees (~$7 at current prices).  So obviously, when you do these kinds of transactions, you want to wait until the network is as quiet as possible and you can get away with the lowest fees possible.  Once you had done that, though, you could pay your hypothetical friend 0.015 BTC from that one 0.3 BTC input, and get a change output of 0.285 back, which again, you could use as a single input to another similiar sized transaction, and so on.  (for simplicity, all of these example transactions of yours, I'm ignoring fees, which also have to be paid from the inputs).


Wallets don't care about prices.  Wallets only deal with bitcoin, not fiat.  Exchanges generally do lock in the prices at transaction submission time, not confirmation.  Other vendors and other people you transact with may have other policies.  You should always check.


When you initialized your wallet, you were given a set of "seed words".  Those seed words are all that are required to recover your wallet, onto another Ledger, or any other device or software wallet that accepts standard seed words for HD wallets.  With those words, your new wallet will generate exactly the same set of keys that your original wallet had, and you will regain access to all the coins those keys control.  It's important to understand that your coins are not "in your wallet".  Coins are not anywhere.  They are just entries on the immutable ledger that is the blockchain.  Your keys grant you access to spend your coins.  As long as you can recreate or recover the keys, you'll always have access to the coins.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:09:43
It makes absolutely no difference.  Addresses do not store or aggregate bitcoins.  Bitcoins are stored in transaction outputs.  If you receive 10 small transactions to 10 different addresses, you have access to 10 outputs (which if you want to spend all the bitcoin, will be 10 inputs to a new transaction).  If you receive 10 small transactions to the same address, you also have 10 outputs, and 10 inputs to a new transaction.  Sending the 10 transactions to the same address does not aggregate them into one lump sum.  it's still 10 transactions, with 10 separate outputs.
Neither scenario will make it "take longer".  How long a transaction takes depends on a number of variables, including your fee rate and variance in the rate of blocks being found by miners.  Also, security is a very minor issue with respect to address reuse.  The primary issue is privacy.
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:40:17
There is nothing stopping you from reusing the same address multiple times.  It's just from a privacy and security perspective, it is not recommended, so very few modern wallets will reuse addresses by default.  As long as you don't delete the wallet, however, you will still have the private key to the address, and you will be able to spend the coins on all transactions to that address, no matter how many of them there are, and even if your "current" address is different or there have been many other addresses used since the reused one was created.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:51:56
Segwit, the technology, has nothing to do with Segwit2x, the contentious hard fork.  It is perfectly safe for you to use segwit addresses on the real bitcoin blockchain for the benefits they bring, including lower fees.  It is impossible to say with certainty what will happen to bitcoin as a result of Segwit2x, and it is advisable to be cautious about how you transact on the bitcoin network around the time of the fork, regardless of what type of addressing you use, but it won't make any difference to you whether your bitcoins are accessed with a segwit address, or a legacy address.

BCH EDA fuckery.  ~3 EH/s of hash power left the BTC chain and went to the BCH chain to rob them of thousands of their coins.  For the past 6 hours, they have been mining 60 blocks an hour (10 times normal) while the BTC chain has mined 23 blocks in the last 6 hours instead of 36, (~60% of normal).  Because blocks are not being mined at the normal rate, plus all the increased activity from the all time highs, transactions are backed up.  Once the BCH chain hits their next retargeting in ~7 hours, the hash rate will return to the BTC chain, and the backlog will start clearing... until the next EDA fuckery.  Such is the "new normal".
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:03:15
Yup, turns out you were right... not long after I posted that, there were several long gaps of half an hour+ between blocks being found, and there were a substantial number of new transactions.  Those are the two factors you can't predict... variance on the 10 minute average block time, and new transactions paying more than you.  At least you can use the chart to accurately see what's happening.  And it looks like it's eaten its way down to about where it was when I posted that, about 5ish MB above 10 sat/B, so again, hopefully soon.

It's hard to say with certainty what will happen, because there are too many factors that can't be predicted.
Here's a [chart](  Scroll down to the bottom chart, and on the legend, click on the "50-60" (your transaction is paying 50 sat/B) to hide everything below you.  What remains on the chart, is transactions above yours.  If you look back across the chart to an hour ago (timestamps on the bottom), you can see the "50+" number around 16000kB (16MB) as I mentioned.  If you look now, you can see that it's down to around 14MB.  In the mean time, 6 blocks were found (right on the expected average).  So 6M were removed, but 4MB of new transactions were added, over that hour, netting you 2MB less above you over that hour.
Tracking that chart, you can get a feel for how it's going.  Basically, your transaction is right at the very bottom of that stack of stripes (assuming you have the "50-60" filter from the legend on), so when the blocks being found manage to eat their way down to the bottom, your transaction will be confirmed.
It's hard to say exactly when that will happen though, as it depends on how quickly blocks are found, and how many new transactions come in.  In general, any service that puts a time limit on the validity of the address and of the order, should be avoided like the plague.  That address IS valid, and your coins are going there eventually, regardless of whether the vendor thinks it is "valid" for their order.  So if it doesn't go through "in time" to please them, you're going to have a support nightmare on your hands, because the coins are going to that address, regardless.  You won't get them back if they think the address "expired".  So you'll have to work it out with them to get what you most certainly will have paid for, even if it is "late".  I can certainly see that it would be a wise idea to try and be proactive with that...
Weekend overnights tend to be pretty good at clearing stuff out, so I would say there's a pretty good chance that it will go through in the next 12 hours, but again, it's impossible to say for certain.

They are.  And in fact you can substantially improve your net return by mining in a pool instead of solo, even after accounting for the fact that they eat a staggering amount of power, so the net number is substantially less than the gross.  The current network hash rate is approximately 10 Exahash/sec, or roughly the equivilent of 1 million of those ASIC miners.  You don't generate that much raw hash power unless people are making a substantial profit.  I only mentioned those devices in the context of demonstrating how utterly and uselessly feeble a mid range GPU was in comparison.

You can use and re-use any address that your wallet generates.  It will continue to work as long as you continue to possess the private keys/seed for that wallet.  Because there are privacy and potential security implications to re-using addresses, modern wallets will generate a new address every time you want to receive coins, but the old ones remain valid.  It just doesn't re-use them by default.

You get the confirmation time you pay for.  If you paid &lt; 10 sat/B, you might have to wait a bit.  If you paid &lt; 5 sat/B, you might have to wait a good while.  Otherwise, transactions are confirming in ~1-2 blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:53:38
You mostly have the general idea right, but bitcoins are not "in" addresses.  Bitcoins are in the outputs of transactions.  The outputs reference an address.  The addresses reference the outputs.  Since it is possible (and in the past, was common) to send multiple transactions to the same address, it is possible to have multiple transaction outputs all referenced by the same address.  If you have 1 that has at least 1.5 BTC on it, you can just use that.  If not, you will have to spend multiple outputs to get enough.
The basic idea of needing a "change" address (another address you control) to accept the difference left over from your inputs vs your recipient outputs, is correct.  The basic idea of any difference between your inputs and all your outputs including your change, becomes the miner fees, is also correct.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:56:59
No, it is in fact you who is misunderstanding the answer, or more accurately, you are misunderstanding bitcoin transactions, addresses, and where the bitcoins "are".
Your example in the text is sending 100 transactions of 10 mBTC to an address.  Your misunderstanding is that at the end of that process, that address will have "1 BTC".  But the truth is, it will not.  What it has is 100 times 10 mBTC.
Bitcoins are not stored in addresses, and addresses, in and of themselves, are not aggregators of bitcoin.  Bitcoins are stored in the outputs of transactions, and the transaction references an address, and the address references the transactions.  A spendable bit of bitcoin is contained in a UTXO, an unspent transaction output.  You sent 100 10 mBTC transactions, and at the end of that process, your destination address references 100 outputs that each have 10mBTC on them.  If you want to spend 250 mBTC, you will have to spend 25 of those outputs, which will result in a large (and expensive, fee wise) transaction.  If you want to spend the whole 1 BTC, you will have to spend all 100 of those outputs, resulting in a very large and very expensive transaction.  The key point to understand here is that merely sending coins to the same address does NOT aggregate them into 1 lump sum.  They remain many separate discrete bits of coin.
What the previous poster suggested that you do, is to consolidate all 100 of those outputs onto a single new transaction output.  That transaction will, as above, have 100 inputs, and will be very large, so you ideally want to wait until the network is at it's absolute quietest, and pay the lowest fee possible, ideally &lt; 5 sat/B, or even the minimum of 1 sat/B.  The output of that transaction will be a value of 1 BTC as a single output, and THAT can be spent very cheaply.

First of all, bitcoinfees.21.co is complete garbage, and it's block and time waits are not even in the same universe as anything remotely resembling accurate.
If you want to see what is actually going on in the mempool, look here:  
Scroll down to the bottom chart.  That shows the data size in kB of transactions at a range of fee rates.  You can click on the ranges in the legend to filter out anything below that range.  So if you click on 10-20, it will filter out everything below 10 sat/B.  If you look at the left scale (or hover hour mouse pointer over the very right edge of the chart), you can see that as of this second (~0840 UTC) there is about 5000 kB (5MB) of transactions at 10 sat/B and above.  Each block that gets found (on average every 10 minutes) removes ~1MB (a little more with segwit transactions), usually from the top, but new transactions are coming in all the time too, so it's a back and forth.  
So when the blocks being found manage to eat their way down to the bottom of that chart (with the 10-20 filter on), your transaction will be confirmed.  Since it's the weekend, there are generally less new transactions coming in than there are being taken out by new blocks, so your transaction should be confirmed "Soon™"... probably a couple of hours.

Electrum is an [open source project]( and in the extremely unlikely event that it was completely abandoned and no one took up maintaining the project or a fork of it, first of all, there's no reason you couldn't just continue to use the last version that was released to access your coins and send them to a new wallet of your choice. 
 Also, someone would be able to easily take the source code and write a quick script that people could use to extract a standard set of BIP32 HD master keys from the electrum seed words.  It is also likely that if electrum were to fall out of use, other wallets would integrate the ability to import electrum seed words directly to ease migration.  So ya, it's very unlikely that you'd ever lose access to your electrum based keys/wallet.

The addresses in question are in [bech32]( format, the native format for segwit addresses.  They are still very new, and most clients and online blockchain explorers do not know how to deal with them yet.  On the live net, these addresses always start with "bc1", and that's how you can identify them.  The data portion is an encoded P2WSH script, so it probably won't mean much to you, but there's a [decoder/verifier]( you can play with if you want.  You can see the same decoded string in the second OUTPUT script on the blockchain.info page above.

As you mention, the primary point of multiple addresses is not aggregation, it is transaction isolation.  You build person A a fence, and collect the fee on address A.  You build person B a fence and collect the fee on address B.  Build for C collect on C.  Etc, for everyone one of the dozens of fences you build.  The first aspect of isolation occurs here in that each of your customers has no idea who else you have built a fence for or how much they paid for it. 
 
Now you pay your rent.  If your fence fee is more than your rent, you reveal only one of your fence building fees.  Your landlord has absolutely no idea how many other fences you've built or how much you collected for them, or even, for that matter, that those coins came from fence building in general or from any particular fence owner in particular.  If your rent is more than one fence fee, you may have to spend multiple transactions to aggregate enough to cover it, but regardless of how many transactions that is, that's how many transactions are revealed, and no more.
Obviously, in the long run, you will probably aggregate various transactions, and change outputs, etc... The bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger, and not reusing addresses, while it helps increase your privacy, is not a perfect privacy solution.  Enhancement of privacy is an area of ongoing research and development within the cryptocurrency space, both at the blockchain and higher layer levels.

It's part of the same (coinbase) transaction.  The value of the coinbase transaction is the current block reward (currently 12.5 BTC), plus the sum of all the fees from all of the transactions in the block.

Not completely cleared, but cleared down to 7.659 sat/B.  If you 
look at the bottom chart on  you can position your cursor at the far right edge and read that there is currently a little less than 3MB of transaction data at 5 sat/B and higher (so slightly less at 7.6 and higher), so you need to see a net clear of roughly 3 blocks before your transaction is confirmed.  I would say that is extremely likely to happen in the next 4 hours.  If you're not in a rush, I would say that was a very good fee choice.

The "miner" who created the block receives the reward.  A "miner" may be a single individual, or a group of individuals acting as a "pool".  How the reward is distributed within a pool is up to the people running the pool.


In the literal sense, yes.  A transaction is not a transaction until it is included into a block and the block is added to the blockchain.  Each block, however, contains many transactions, typically several thousand, but the actual number varies because the size of individual transactions varies, and also demand varies (there aren't always enough transactions to fill a block)

One of the perils of asking retards on the internet for advice on serious matters is that you get a lot of really bad advice.  And the replies in this thread so far are no exception.
I get the distinct impression that you do not fully grasp the implications of you being "investigated for fraud".  As soon as you heard those words, you should have gone into "I am in deep shit" mode.  Fraud, especially if dealing with large sums of money, as you indicate you were, is a serious federal crime.  So is receiving stolen property, even if you didn't know it was stolen.  Contact the best lawyer you can afford, immediately.  You're going to need one.  You're probably about to lose every penny you ever made trading bitcoins and then some trying to get yourself clear of this thing.
If you attempt to move the money now that you have been explicitly notified not to, you will almost certainly find yourself in jail, your bank accounts and all other assets confiscated, and almost certainly you will never be able to open a bank account again for the rest of your life.  Trying to get away with the proceeds of a crime only compounds the crime.
You are in a very serious situation.  Your ability to get out of it as undamaged as possible depends on you being very, very careful about the things you do next.  Talk to a lawyer.  Do not talk to anyone else about this... the bank, police, anyone, until you have talked to a lawyer.  Really.  It's not just a TV show cliche.  The things you say from now on will almost certainly be recorded, and can and will be used against you, and Canada has no Miranda rights... they are under no obligation to warn you not to fuck yourself.
edit to add:  I just read that you're 16 years old.  That's a shame.  In a way, that's good, it means you won't spend more than 3 years in prison and you would do your time in juvi.  But it's also bad... because you're 16, and a moron.  You desperately need to understand that there are wrong actions you can take here in the immediately future that will completely ruin the rest of your life, and make the next few years of it a complete living hell, and horrifyingly, you are talking about taking some of them!
Are you frightened yet?  You should be.  You probably are, if you're not a complete moron.  Good.  You cannot run away from this.  You cannot handle this on your own with the ignorance of a 16-year-old.  You need help, badly.  Tell your parents, immediately.  They need to know that you are in trouble and that you need help.  They need to help you get a good lawyer.  I hope for your sake you have good, smart parents.  The banks are not playing games with cute internet magic money.  This is not a fucking joke.

EDIT:  At the time I wrote this, I hadn't actually checked the linked page, and since I personally compile from source, I'd never looked at the PPA.  I've now looked at the PPA, and it is maintained by Matt Corallo of the core team, directly, not by a third party maintainer.  There is, in my opinion, no real "trust" issue of any kind raised by using this PPA, as it comes directly from a bitcoin core maintainer, so convenience wise, using the PPA is just as secure as compiling from source.  The other issues of being able to get releases immediately without waiting for a package release are  unchanged, so I leave that text below.
tl;dr:  Unless you're comfortable as a programmer and with git workflow, you're fine with a PPA.  You sacrifice a very small possibility of code compromise/trust, for convenience.
Personally, I always compile from source.  Working with a PPA or other pre-pack is a matter of convenience and trust.  If you have a good working understanding of how to use git and compile *nix applications from source, IMO, doing so is preferable. 
When working from the repo directly, you know that you are using the actual unaltered source code.  When using a PPA, you have to trust that the maintainer is giving you an unaltered binary.  The chances are very low that they aren't, but it's still a trust point in what is supposed to be a trustless system.
With source, you will have access to changes and updates immediately when they are committed, and you can run unreleased but committed code (testing) if you wish.  With a PPA, you will have to wait for the maintainer to compile a new release and make it available.  The negative corollary of that, of course, is that if you don't really know what you're doing, you may compile master branch with some commits that aren't entirely stable and end up using that.  Personally, I always compile from the latest major tag (currently the 0.15 tag branch, which also tracks the 0.15 point releases) so I know I'm getting a stable release.  With a PPA, you know you're always getting a stable release.

1/ You are mostly correct, but the cryptographic process involved is actually called "hashing", not encryption.  Hashing is a cryptographic function that reduces a large amount of data to a small output such that it is guaranteed that no two different inputs will ever result in the same output.  It is like a very advanced and secure form of checksum.  If you hash a set of data, and compare that to a known hash result for that data, and they match, you can be certain that data, and no other possible data, produced that hash output, and therefore the data is valid and unaltered.  The algorithm is also called just SHA-256, no second H.  The letters stand for Secure Hash Algorithm.
2/ No, the nonce is basically just a piece of random data.  There is a certain amount of data within the block that is constant, or semi-constant:  Most of the header values, the previous block's hash, the timestamp (semi, changes relatively infrequently compared to hash speed), and the transactions themselves, although adding and removing transactions is an option.  If you collect up all that data and hash it, and don't get a result that has sufficient leading zeros to meet the target, then you have to change something and try again.  One of the things you can change is the nonce.  It has no other purpose other than to change something to produce a different hash result.
3/ Yes, that is entirely correct.  Also, an additional piece of semi-random data, known as the "coinbase" field, which is an arbitrary field of data that each miner sets for their blocks, and will be unique between different miners.  This field is stored in the script data for the "coinbase" transaction, the first transaction in the block, which rewards the miner with the current block reward and the fees from the transactions in the block.
4/ If you are in a pool, then you submit your result back up to the pool's stratum server, who then process it further.  If you are solo mining, then the processing happens directly.  The mining node adds the block using the `submitblock` rpc command.  The node validates everything in the block, and if everything passes, it passes the block on to all the nodes connected to it, who also each re-validate it, and then pass it on to all the nodes connected to them, and so on, until the new block has propagated to the entire network.

As you set about trying to understand how cryptocurrency technology works, probably one of the single most important concepts to grasp, is that your BTC is NOT "in" your Electrum wallet.  Or any other wallet.  The BTC, the "coins" are just ledger entries on the blockchain.  They don't ever exist anywhere other than on the blockchain.  What's in your Electrum wallet, or any other wallet, are your keys.  Your seed words are used to generate (or re-generate) those keys.  As long as you have your keys, or the means to recover or recreate them (a backup or the seed words), you can never lose access to your coins.

The revenue is exactly zero.  You cannot mine bitcoin with any kind of PC/GPU, certainly not laptops.  Power costs are irrelevant.  You don't have sufficient hash power to solve even one share before someone else finds a block, forcing you to start over from scratch.
It is possible, although unlikely, that you can mine some other coin than bitcoin profitably, but the amount of money you will "earn" by doing so can probably be measured in pennies.  Once a month, you can buy yourself a nice coffee, maybe.  Meanwhile, you're running your laptops into the ground.  In no sense is this a worthwhile endeavor.

More or less, yes.  The field is actually a 32 bit integer, and the usual procedure is to just start at 0x00000000 and add 1 each time up to 0xffffffff.  If you use up all 4 billion-ish nonces without finding a valid hash, then you must change something else.  I am glossing over some deeply technical details here (some of which I don't fully understand myself), but that's the general idea, anyway.
The data is not formatted as you present it (the nonce is one of the fields in the block header, as is the previous block hash, timestamp, etc), but the essential idea is correct.  The nonce is also not the "proof of work".  The "proof of work" concept refers to the entire process of generating a hash to meet the target (the number of required leading 0s).  The target is regularly adjusted (every 2016 blocks) so that the amount of work that needs to be done (the number of 0s needed) increases as the amount of aggregate hash power available to the network increases (and vice versa), such that the average block time stays as near to 10 minutes as possible.
And again, nitpicking, just SHA-256, not SHAH-256.  Secure Hash Algorithm, 256 bits (the size of the output)


I can not purport to speak for "the bitcoin community", nor do I consider myself knowledgeable enough to make definitive statements on many of these issues.  Trying to determine the "community response" to anything in bitcoin is a non-trivial challenge for which there are currently no universally reliable solutions.
Speaking solely for myself, however, I will say that I don't think that limit is "far too low".  Block space scarcity is a fundamental technical design feature of the system.  If there is no scarcity of block space, then there is no incentive for users to compete via fees for miners to mine their transactions, which is both a disincentive to spam transactions, and one of the fundamental incentives for miners to mine, an incentive that will continue to increase in importance as the block reward continues to halve every 210000 blocks (every ~4 years).  Miners do important work that has real costs to them, and they deserve to be appropriately paid, and they won't be if there is insufficient demand for the work they produce.  Needless to say, this is a point of considerable contention between the sides of the "scaling debate".
There are indeed other solutions to potential future issues of transaction throughput (and (further) lowering fees), that do not rely on modifying the way the underlying bitcoin network operates.  These are commonly referred to as "layer 2 solutions", and the most common of those, still under development at the moment, is the Lightning Network, which you may want to investigate further.
And finally, there is nothing dreaded about segwit.  Segwit is one of the best technological upgrades to the bitcoin network... well... ever.  The segwit upgrade has been included in the core client software since early last year, has been live on the bitcoin main network since August, and is increasingly being adopted by users (currently ~10% of transactions are segwit transactions).
Segwit, qua technology, is not Segwit2x, AKA the New York "Agreement" (NYA), which is a contentious (ie. not overwhelmingly agreed on) hard fork and widely considered an attack against the bitcoin network.  It is segwit2x, and only segwit2x, which engenders "dread" among users at least within the community of this sub, and that dread has almost nothing to do with the technical merits or lack there-of of their proposal.  The fundamental goals and motivations of Segwit2x are political, and it is those political goals which many are opposed to.  There are other users, elsewhere, who are opposed on principle to the entire concept of segwit itself, but, again, in my opinion, that opposition is based purely on non-technical motivations, and/or a fundamental misunderstanding (whether by ignorance or deliberate evasion) of what the technology is and how it works.  Most of those people have already split off from mainline bitcoin with the previous BCash hard fork.
By way of saving myself some trouble, aside from what I've said above, I have absolutely no interest in discussing or debating the topic of Segwit2x or the hard fork, so if you have additional questions about that, you'll have to take them up with someone else.

 &gt; the hash problem is not so much an enormous computation, more like an enormous guessing game to guess the right 64 bit hexadecimal hash value.
That's where your lack of understanding caught up with you.  It is not a guessing game.  It is a computation.
A hash is, by definition, a cryptographic computation.  When you compute the hash value of a set of data (the block), the result is a 256 bit value (not 64) that is deterministic (it will always be the same for the same set of data) but random (no two sets of data produce the same value, and changing even 1 bit in the data totally changes the hash value in a completely unpredictable way).
The process of mining consists of generating these hash values, looking for a value that is less than the current difficulty target.  If the value that is generated is not less than the target, then they change a bit or two, and try again, which produces a completely different value to check.  They do this (in aggregate) quintillions of times per second, until a valid (low enough) hash is found.  It's not just a "guess".

No idea.  No clue what the device is capable of.  I guess so?


Yes?  For some definition of "hashing".  Is it wasting power doing calculations that will never be used for anything?  Yes.  Is it actually contributing anything to finding hashes for the pool and actually doing real work for the bitcoin network?  No.  It is literally burning power for absolutely no productive purpose. 


Yes, as evidenced by the fact that you are receiving block found notifications. There have been 21 blocks found by the network (NB) in the 3:40 that it has been running, but your device has not contributed a single valid share (A:0) in that entire time.  The network is literally finding a block before you can complete work on even 1 share, every single time.  Hence, you are contributing absolutely nothing and you are literally wasting power for no productive purpose.

The *amount* you are sending is irrelevant.  What matters is the *size in bytes* of the transaction.  Assuming you are sending from a single input, to two outputs (destination and change), with a non-segwit address, the fee at 2 sat/B would be roughly 500 satoshis (0.000005 BTC).  If you are sending from more inputs or to more outputs, the fee will be more.  If your inputs are segwit addresses, the fee will be less (and bech32 segwit addresses, even less).  If you create the transaction in Electrum, and press "Preview", it will show you all of these details and the exact amount of the fee.

You are correct that 91 sat/B is not an incredibly low fee, but it is in fact too low for immediate confirmation at the moment.  I'd say it's possible, but iffy, that it will go through in 90 minutes.
If you look at the bottom chart on [this page]( and click on the 80-100 in the legend (the range your fee rate is in) to filter out everything below you, and then read on the left axis (or hover your mouse over the very right edge of the chart and look at the 80+ and 100+ numbers, yours is kinda in between those two), then you can see that there is about 3-5MB of transaction data above you in the queue.  When the new blocks being found eat down to about half way through the bottom blue stripe, your transaction should be confirmed.  If a bunch more stuff piles on top and the stuff above you grows, obviously that hurts your chances.  You're at the mercy of blocks being found and hopefully not too many new transactions, but at least you can see where you're at.
In general, you should shun any business that puts a time limit on transactions.  Your transaction IS going through, eventually, and there's no way to cancel it if it's "too late" for your recipient.  If that happens, you'll have to deal with them somehow to get your money back.

Your likelihood of finding a block solo on a mid-tier GPU is indistinguishable from zero.  Solo mining with a current top of the line 13.5 Terahash/sec ASIC miner you would find a block, on average, every 1.5 YEARS (and that's assuming static difficulty for 1.5 YEARS, which... no.)  A mid grade GPU is perhaps 20000 times less powerful than that ASIC miner.  You can do the math.  You're not in 2011 any more, Toto.

First of all, it's very unlikely that the fee rate is actually 0.835 sat/B, because a transaction with that fee rate would not be widely propagated by the network, where the default minimum fee is 1 sat/B.  
That said, if you're getting that rate from looking up the transaction on most blockchain explorer websites (notably blockchain.info), they do not report the fee rate correctly because they don't correctly account for size vs. vsize for segwit transactions.  The real fee rate is actually higher, because the vsize of the transaction is smaller so the fee is actually spread over fewer bytes, and thus the fee is probably at least minimally over 1 sat/B.
Finally, the [current next block rate]( is ~8 sat/B (bottom chart).  There is currently about 6.6 MB in the pool, so ~6 blocks, so even if the fee they used is buried at the moment, it should clear relatively quickly.  In the the absence of the kind of persistent spam we saw in the second half of 2017, it's very unlikely anything will get "stuck in limbo" for any sizable length of time.

Just a technical correction to your OP to start... the current block reward is 12.5 BTC/block, not 25.  "halvenings" happen every 210000 blocks.  It started at 50, was reduced to 25 at block 210000, and was reduced again to 12.5 at block 420000.  We are currently at block 474476.  It will be halved again to 6.25 BTC/block at block 630000, expected sometime in late June 2020.
With that out of the way, yes, pools exist to split up the workload of a single logical miner into many physical miners.  Each member of the pool gets a packet of work to test for valid hashes.  Just like at the logical level, only one of them will actually find a valid hash, but all members of the pool get rewarded based on how much effort they contributed to trying to find it.  Once one of the physical miners finds a hash, it is passed up through the pool back to the mining organization, who then actually put out the validated block onto the network, and claim the reward.  Everyone in the pool is then given a new packet of work to start again on the next block. How they actually split up that reward among the pool members varies... there are different payment schemes, and some pools keep a fixed percentage and only pay out a portion to the pool.  That's why you have to do your research into what those rules are for whatever pool you join if you're mining in a pool.

Spend some time learning how to read the lower chart on   That tells you everything you need to know.  For starters, click on the "5-10" on the legend, to turn off the 0-5 sat/B transactions (which are frequently heavily loaded with dust consolidation transactions at ~1 sat/B) which will make the remainder of the chart easier to read.  If load is heavier, and there is substantial volume at higher levels, you can click further up the legend.  If the 0-5 volume has been completely cleared, you can turn it back on.
Now position your mouse at the very right edge of the lower chart.  The pop-up tip shows the cumulative data size at every step of the fee levels.  For example, if you look right now, the 5+ level has ~600kB of data.  A block holds 1MB (assuming the miner fills the block, which they are not obligated to do).  So if a block were to be mined right that instant, it would take everything 5 sat/B and above, and 400kB more of the 0-5 sat/B transactions to fill a block.  Therefore you can safely say (barring a massive influx of higher paying transactions all of a sudden, or an unusually long wait time for the next block, both of which can potentially happen), that if you set your fees at 5 sat/B, you would get in the next block.  You could probably set them slightly lower, but then your chance of missing the block increases.  Even if, you'd still likely be confirmed within a few blocks, as mempool traffic has been trending lately.  But you have to look and make an evaluation every time to know for sure.

This site is completely and hopelessly inaccurate, as has been pointed out by many people, myself included, many times before.  STOP REFERRING TO THIS SITE FOR FEE ESTIMATION!  It is worse than useless.
**LOOK at the site I linked!**  Look at the bottom graph.  Look ~1:30 minutes ago (~2330 EDT).  At that moment in time, a block was mined, and the mempool was left with **14** transactions for **8KB** of data.  As of this exact instant (~0100 EDT), the mempool contains 1810 transactions for a total of 762KB of data. 
 The mempool is **EMPTY**.  How, exactly, do you propose that miners fill a 1MB block with 762KB of data? 
I run a full node.  I can SEE the mempool.  I don't need some incompetently implemented website to tell me what is in it.
If you don't know what you're talking about, please... remain silent.  You'll make less of a fool of yourself.

You are conflating two separate things. 
1/ Forks.  A fork is a fundamental change in the operating parameters, known as the "consensus rules" that determine the validity of all aspects of operation of the bitcoin network.  A soft fork is a fork that modifies the rules in a way that makes them less permissive, and retains backward compatibility with older clients that do not recognize the more restrictive rules.  A hard fork modifies the rules in a way that makes them more permissive, and because of that, requires that all clients upgrade to enable those rules.  Clients that do not upgrade will reject activity produced by the more permissive clients.
2/ A chain split.  Natural chain splits happen from time to time, as you mention, and are recovered from invisibly and automatically by the network.  A contentious chain split occurs when a hard fork occurs, and some parts of the network refuse to upgrade to the more permissive software.  There will be a point at which incompatible blocks will be rejected by the more restrictive chain, and the blocks built on top of each chain after the split will be different.  All that is required for this to occur is for there to be two (or more) incompatible versions of the bitcoin software in use, and for some parts of the network to run one, and some parts to run another (obviously, all parts require at least some mining power building their own chain).
It is entirely possible to have a hard fork that does not split the chain, by having everyone agree to run the modified, more permissive client.  Doing this, of course, requires careful planning and extensive testing.  I will leave it to you to determine whether you think that applies to any of the current scenarios.

This is false.  Transactions of either address type can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. [example](
Basically, Type "1" addresses are for Pay To Public Key Hash (P2PKH).  Type "3" addresses are for Pay To Script Hash (P2SH).  These types relate to what is necessary to spend the coins associated with the address.
There is a bunch of complicated processing involved in both cases, but to super (over) simplify it, coins on a P2PKH address can be spent by simply possessing the private key that matches the public key that hashes to that address (which is used to produce a signature, which can be verified using the matching public key, which is also supplied, and which can be verified in relation to the address itself).
P2SH addresses, on the other hand, allow the ability to spend to be controlled by an arbitrary script, which may have a number of relatively arbitrary conditions associated with it, such as requiring multiple signatures.  Coins on that address are spendable if you can supply a script that matches the hash, and data for the script that causes it to return true.  While the conditions can be arbitrary, the vast majority of P2SH addresses out there are probably for multi-sig wallets, which require signatures from multiple private keys to spend.
Further reading (mostly very technical):
 (defines the P2SH standard)

Any software wallet that allows you to create your own keys, preferably with a HD "seed" that allows the wallet to be recreated from a list of 12-24 seed words (which you must remember or record and store in a safe manner), is an adequate solution, although obviously not as secure as a hardware wallet.  I have not specifically used either Jaxx or Breadwallet, so I cannot speak to the quality of either of them, but pretty much any standalone app, mobile or PC, is superior in every way to a web based custodial wallet like coinbase.

Step 1:  Take all the money you were planning to "invest" in bitcoin mining and put it in a big pile somewhere fire safe and well ventilated outside.  BBQ/fire pits work well.
Step 2:  Douse the pile of money with lighter fluid.
Step 3:  Carefully use a match, lighter, or fire starter to ignite the pile of money.
Step 4:  Enjoy a few brief minutes of colorful flames and slight warmth.
And... it's gone.

"They" (whoever "they" might be), certainly could make that change.  Doing so would cause a hard fork and almost certainly a chain split.  And absolutely no one (with a brain) would have anything to do with the side of the split that got inflated, and "proper" bitcoin would carry on as normal.

Transactions on the bitcoin network are not denominated in fiat currencies.  Any resource that displays bitcoin transactions denominated in fiat currency is, by definition, horseshit.

which is an excellent demonstration of why that site is pure shit for fee estimation.
@_date: 2017-07-09 05:48:29
I am well aware of that.
To the best of my knowledge, the minrelaytxfee for jochen-hoenicke.de is the same as on my full-node and virtually every other node on the network:  the bitcoin core default of 0.00001 BTC/KB (1 sat/B).  (I base this conclusion on the fact that his data exactly matches mine, and mine is at that default setting.)
From the [wiki]( 


The issue at hand here is why miners are not filling blocks.  The fact that many of them are not mining transactions with a fee lower than the default minrelaytxfee should be obvious.  The fact that there are not, as others in this thread have claimed, numerous 1-30 sat/B transactions, is also obvious to anyone who bothers to look at the actual contents of the ("a") mempool with default settings of a lower tx limit of 1 sat/B.  While the ("a") mempool may not be "empty" by some strict definition of the word, for the purposes of this discussion, why blocks are being mined less than full, the ("a") mempool is *effectively* empty for a substantial subset of mining nodes.

Whoever told you that did you a massive disservice.  That site is absolutely terrible at fee estimation, and you will overpay for fees for certain, especially if the transaction is not high priority, which obviously a transfer between your own two wallets almost certainly isn't.  402 sat/B is not the highest fee imaginable, but it's pretty damn high.  a fee between 30-50 sat/B would have cleared in a few hours at best, or a few days at worst (you could go even lower if you waited until the weekend).
The change went back to the sending wallet.  You were spending a single input of 0.014 BTC.  You must spend the entire input... you can't spend only part of it.  You wanted to send 0.002 elsewhere, and you had to pay fees.  Whatever is left over from that input goes back to the originating wallet, on a different address, for additional security.  Some wallets will send it back to the same address, but most modern wallets use a separate change address for every new transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:07:19
Change.  Input utxo = 0.01421713, output = 0.00270713, fees = 0.00151, change = 0.01

Let's be 100% clear here, this is **NOT** a good graph.  It is complete and utter horseshit.  That ridiculous site claims that the "fastest and cheapest" fee rate is 330 sat/B, when a casual glance at  shows that in fact the appropriate rate is currently 1/10th that or less.  That site continues to show fees rates and estimated confirmation times 10x or more what they should be even after actual fee rates have been low for hours on end.  Please, for the love of sanity, stop telling people to use that ridiculous site to determine fees.  Anyone using that site is quite simply just throwing away their coins and lining the pockets of miners for absolutely no good reason!

In Electrum, go to the Wallet menu, and turn on Addresses.  Then go to the Addresses tab, scroll down, and open the "Change" group.  You should see your change address there, with a balance of 0.01 BTC on it.  You should also see "Balance:  10.00000 mBTC" (or whatever your units of choice are) in the status bar at the lower left of the main window.

You are absolutely correct that  is complete garbage, and absurdly inaccurate, and you are absolutely correct that   is currently showing transactions at ~40-50 sat/B clearing in 1 block.
I do recommend, however, that you use the bottom chart (mempool size) instead of the top chart (transaction count), because that will give you a better idea of what will be pulled out with the next block (hover  your cursor over the very right edge of the graph, and read the numbers down to ~1000kB (1MB, a block worth of space), and that is what will clear if the next block happened right this minute.)  This assumes, of course, that the miner pulls 100% of the top paying transactions off the top of the pile, and that they fill the block, neither of which are guaranteed to be true, but it's a good rule of thumb.

Fact:  If you paid anything more than 10 sat/B for a non-critical transaction at any time after about noon UTC on Friday, you overpaid.  This is normal behavior for weekends (although last week it extended well into Monday.)  I did a transaction Friday night around midnight UTC at 10 sat/B and it went through in 12 minutes (and no I'm not going to post "proof", because I can't be arsed to obfuscate an image).  I did carefully monitor the mempool and carefully time the transaction to achieve that, but it was well worth the time for the savings.
Note that the total size of the mempool is not a particularly useful piece of information.  What you really need to know is the size of the mempool that is sitting above your targeted fee rate.  If you look at the mempool right now sure, it's 27.8MB, but 27.4MB of that is at &lt; 10 sat/B. There is only ~400KB above 10 sat/B.  What this means is that, barring a massive influx of high fee transactions (which happens... with suspicious regularity), or an abnormally long break between mined blocks (which just happens, period, variance is a thing), a transaction at 10 sat/B is guaranteed to go into the next block if that block happened right this minute.  By far the best tool for monitoring this is the bottom chart at   Click on the 10-20 in the legend to turn off the 0-10 and more easily see what's happening above it.
Happy fee saving.
