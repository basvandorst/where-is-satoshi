Dont sent the same amount twice! They have automatic system checks to prevent that your funds are credited double! If they detect the same amout, there will be dalays!

I think it's not plain wrong. And of course there are issues and uncertainties because its so new. It wouldn't be at $3000 if everything was crystal clear and perfect developed. It's new - so give it time.

haha, just store your coins at 
good luck

if lost coins can be recovered calculating the private key, bitcoin would be worthless. because you can "recover" (calculate) EVERY private key. 
if sha256 maybe will be insecure in the future, is it possible to change the algorithm to a better one? like a fork?

Why use amazon as a middle man when bitcoin aims to be decentralized? In my optinion this is completely useless.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:07:48
What happend?

I think most of these who invested in 2010/2011 already sold their coins, or cant find the keys, or the exchange got hacked. I dont have any numbers, but I think very much sold before or dont have access to "their" coins anymore.

Dont push him into Bitcoin. He clearly dont want to buy Bitcoin, so it's completely his own decision.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:34:07

@_date: 2017-08-18 18:16:36
why not just use bitcoin again? jj

why aslmost no one understands how it actually works? thanks daguito81 for poiting this out.
you sign the transaction with your private key. no one can "extract" your private key from your signed tx.

Is it true that 0.5 % of the population own bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:18:34

@_date: 2017-09-08 23:33:15

TenX for example made a youtube video and showed some of the characters of the real ETH address. The founder of TenX was also in the video.

Why only today and not even later? I mean ... if they own x % of bitcoin. In the future they will still own the same amount of % so they can still manipulate it as they are doing it right know?! Dont know if they actually are/can manipulate the market. But based on your assumption they still could do the same thing in a few years.
