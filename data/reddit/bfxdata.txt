Not available for viewers outside the UK I'm afraid. It will be broadcasted on BBC World News multiple times this week, if I'm not mistaken

did you read the little help section (blue link above the charts?):




Same two charts below, but these display Long/Shorts vs LTCUSD price.
Also atm there are not 25 million dollars worth in shorts on bitfinex but ~5.5 million (5.26 million in BTC shorts and 246k worth of LTC shorts). The green area in the charts represents USD Swaps (= long positions).

Personally I find that  gives the best overview of Long and Short totals on bitfinex, as it allows to compare BTC and LTC swaps (shorts) to USD swaps (longs) in USD value.

I'm the developer of [Bfxdata.com]( Would you (and the users, do reply if so...) be interested in having a similar stats service for p2p swaps on okcoin? contact me if you are (and provide me with api details) and I'll build a similar platform for okcoin p2p swaps. bfxdata ( at ) gmail.com

look at this page:  Shows you long and short totals, both expressed in USD to make the value comparable.

This is because of how swaps are opened on Bitfinex. If a trader wants to short, he can sell coins and the system will automatically match the trader's swap demand with existing swap offers. These demands won't first appear in the demand book, as they are executed immediately (think of them as market orders when you buy or sell coins) only if you manually enter a swap demand (for instance if you feel the current offers are at a too high rate) will the swap demand be added to the demands list, as it's not possible to match the demand to an existing offer. To sum up the offer side will almost always have a lot bigger volume than the demand side, and this supposed to be so as 99% of the traders let the exchange open a swap automatically (you can define some parameters when you trade on margin) for them when they want to open a short or (leveraged) long position. Hope this helps

all bitcoins traded in shorts on Bitfinex actually DO exist: someone opening a short and selling bitcoins on margin, first needs to loan those coins from a swap provider. These are not bitcoins created "out of thin air" as I interpret your post. Bitfinex has a peer 2 peer swap platform. This means the BTC used to short are borrowed from another user (not borrowed from the exchange (just on paper)). So in theory at least on Bitfinex everything traded should be real Bitcoins. As for shorts on other exchanges, we just don't know as these exchanges do provide the liquidity for opening shorts themselves, and don't provide data on those borrowed coins or fiat. Just my 2 pennies.

You do know Bitfinex is not Chineese right? The company is registered in Honking but is operated by Europeans / Americans.

To open a short on Bitfinex, you need to borrow btc (or Ltc) to sell and buy back later at a lower price. Bfx has a peer 2 peer lending / borrowing system to provide liquidity for shorts (and leveraged longs). This means when you open a short of say 10 btc, the system matches your liquidity demand with a liquidity offer from a other user. These offers/demands of liquidity are called swaps on bfx. You pay interest on the swap you use set by the swap offerer. The chart represents the total sum of all active swaps. The green area represents all USD swaps used for long positions. The two red areas represent btc/ltc swaps used in short poisons. As it is hard to compare Btc/Ltc to USD I made a chart where the shorts are converted into USD equivalent. There are also chart displaying absolute btc/USD/ltc totals on other pages. To profit from a declining market you have to make sure that the profit from your short is bigger than the interest you have to pay plus the fees. There is a calculator on bfxdata for calculating profits and losses on shorts (it doesn't take into account swap interests though)

Always nice to add a racist comment... It helps to improve the discussion so much, thank you very much for your insights

Actually its 15 million in leveraged longs at the moment.
You might find these charts informative as well:

actually [here]( are the live stats of BTC swaps. If you want more historical stats take a look [here]( and if you want to see absolute numbers on the total sum of shorts check [here](
