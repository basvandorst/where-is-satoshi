Like always, human giving bad use to things, we will repeat the same mistake again and again. Bitcoin was originaly created for make anonymous desentralized money transactions, now 99% of people they just see like a Invest, like Ibex35 price goes up or down and they win or loose money.
I think bitcoin started good, but when something becames very popular, people came to make their shit.

These is happening in my country since 2012, just read bitcointalk forums, more than 30 sellers banned account from bank in localbitcoins just for trade with cripto, Bitcoin will be a huge potential danger for the banks, cause its descentralized, and people dont want to be not free. And banks they are fucking those who buy/sell cripto. The war just begans
