okay cool. thank you &lt;3 do they store multiple currencies? Can I put IOTA on it too?

Do you lose the wallet and the money if you lose/break your phone? I think I prefer one on my computer. It's brand new and doesn't walk around with me

Yes, how suspicious that a person who recently found out they've earned a chunk of money would be interested in repeating that success with other investments. Thankfully there are several Reddit Detectives on the job.
I quite obviously do not own a wallet and don't know how they work, so I'm asking about them.

damn straight

wow holy fuck! so what is the answer? just hardware wallets all the way? you can't store IOTA/ADA in hww's yet though, so what do you do?

Don't worry. I'm like a black hole. Information only travels one way with me.

it's always so nice to meet new people, isnt it
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:06:50
man this is scary. I'm so new to all of this that it all just sounds like a bad idea.

oh and if you dont mind me asking - what are the ways in which digital wallets are stolen from? is it just like, someone phishes your password? or someone hacks the company that stores the wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:14:53
Is a paper wallet just as susceptible to hacking/phishing as a digital wallet? I read about them and I don't really understand the difference.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:14:42
thank you! I will definitely message you

My two chief concerns are security and ease of moving BTC out of the wallet and selling. Especially when i decide the time is right to sell everything. Will a paper wallet allow me to move the money around very quickly?
