Stop loss orders on the exchanges can also pose a terrible risk depending on how volatile your chosen currency is and how much loss you're willing to accept before liquidating. Placing a stop loss order can both save you from total disaster, or very quickly realize a loss for you while five minutes later the currency marches on.

Noise levels from equal sources only stack like that if they are perfectly synched. Peaks and troughs only line up if all the fans are perfectly equal and started at the exact same time, so the wavelets will see both destructive and constructive interference. Without correlation, a 6 dB increase will never happen. Assume a 3dB increase.

One comment to that last bit is: Never make 100% moves, ever. Ladder them. If you're going to sell, do it in stages. Same thing if you're buying back in during a slide. You'll never get maximum value, but you'll never be left behind by the support or resistance level that turned out to be a trampoline either.

It's just yet another regurgitation of the same talking points critics have been using for ages.
1) Neither does fiat currency since none of them are tied to a tangible asset any longer. 
2) Bubble, bubble, bubble. True, but irrelevant if you believe in the technology. A bubble is the phenomenon of people overpaying relative to actual value. Adoption is low and so is actual usability. The future is a fluid thing. That doesn't mean crypto can't succeed. And if it does, the bubble becomes reality.
3) Regulation will happen one way or the other. The world doesn't run on anarchy, so rules will pop up. Nothing unexpected there, and there are both upsides and downsides to this. Doesn't mean anything ends. 
4) Yes, yes, we know the fees are high. That's why developers are working on solutions. I mean what the..? People need to figure out things don't happen overnight.

Yes. But taken into account that some countries already have accepted it as a form of payment, companies offer to pay salaries in bitcoin, governments let you pay taxes with it, ATM's are popping up all over... it's well on the way now. It's hard to miss bitcoin these days. 
As for the people who bought high... well. They kind of brought that on themselves. And 99% of them likely didn't buy in because of anything but simple everyday greed. I can't feel sorry for them. Especially if they panic sold after the fact. From my point of view, that kind of people are more than welcome to stay far away from crypto. I'd much rather have people buy in who are looking forward to spending their coin than people who want to convert it back to fiat and become rich in whatever currency they use.

The argument is that Bitcoin can and does change when there is consensus for a change. The bcash proponents did not have it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:09:29
Cheers, that's what I meant. 
I agree that they're making the same sort of sound. However, that doesn't mean they'll sum at all. Ever worked with speakers? Have a few of the same kind of unit, reverse the wires on one of them, and you'll find the overall noise level drops dramatically because one driver is actively countering the others. In any case, there's no governing unit here to sync the fans; they'll run at whatever rpm they happen to have out of the box - the odds of having two that never go out of phase are astronomical. 
Any sound above 1KHz is bound to reinforce or cancel very unpredictably in a three dimensional zone. You won't see 6 dB. Just think of your PC (if you have one with a great many identical fans). For instance I'm running a watercooled rig with no less than 21 120mm fans. If there was a 6dB noise level stacking effect here, I'd have gone from whisper quiet to jet turbine long ago. My SPL meter definitely agrees with me on that.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:45:39
Anyone who have been around for awhile, I think. It's not the first plunge, and the future no doubt holds many more. 
Best advice I can offer when bitcoin has taken a deep dive is to keep calm and remind yourself that reacting now is reacting to something that's *already happened*. The damage is done already. Selling after the plunge means realizing the loss. Trends reverse. Have a plan, always ladder in and out, and don't react to the moves bitcoin already made.
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:18:12
Exactly! Hindsight is always 20/20. For instance, I'm pretty sure anyone who's been in BTC for more than a couple of months remembers the days leading up to December when it was closing in on 10K. I felt it was crazy. Surreal even. So I mentioned this to a colleague (the CFO in fact) of mine who knows I have bitcoin. He told me I should really sell because it was bound to run into massive resistance and there would no doubt be a sell-off. It seemed like a fair analysis at the time, a good time to get out and wait to get back in. Nevertheless I held. And bitcoin? Straight through the roof. Had I sold then, I still wouldn't be able to get in at anywhere near a profit.

All transactions are written to the blocks. Logically, the smaller the block size, the less transactions can be written onto the chain per block.

Just keep in mind how much said investment is up since this time last year. Dumb money flowed in, dumb money flowed back out. It has changed exactly nothing for the people who didn't buy in because it was trendy. 
If you think of it as an investment - which I don't even like to do - one might be tempted to say it's been awesome. But no matter what you throw your money at - when something's suddenly has doubled in value over a period of three weeks, take a step back and realize that's it probably not the time to buy in.

There *is* only one Bitcoin. When someone "fixes" whatever they perceive to be an issue with the blockchain, they need to seek consensus for the change. If they end up being the minority, the changes are rejected. A forked coin is a *minority* that breaks away from the blockchain. Like when you want larger blocks and can't get consensus and end up with the bcash fork. When you're the forked chain, you aren't the original.

Changes to the Bitcoin protocol happen only if a consensus can be reached. If you propose a change and can't reach said consensus, it's not happening. You can then implement the changes anyway, and given miner support a hard fork can then result - the minority chain will be the forked chain.

Inflation can happen no matter what currency you hold. It's simply a sustained increase in the price of goods, and that can happen for a great many reasons.

Investors call us stupid bag holders. We don't think so. We're just the people who believe in Bitcoin. We don't want to sell back into fiat... that's not the idea.

Bitcoin was - very rapidly - appreciating through summer and fall. Then came December with a regular stampede of unhinged bitcoin shoppers. It should not be a surprise to anyone it's coming back down. Everything we're seeing is a result of mad panic moves, first in one direction, then the other. So what if it drops a month of gains nobody sane would have believed sustainable? I for one welcome getting rid of all the opportunistic get-rich-in-20-minutes people.

Not true. Price follows normal supply and demand. If someone has a shit ton of bitcoin and doesn't want it, dumps it on the market, supply is increased.

Also, explain to me why the new chain was dubbed "bitcoin cash" if nobody wanted to use that name to begin with? And absolutely explain to me why it is acceptable to anyone that now, half a year later, we start pretending bitcoin cash is in fact called bitcoin?

Yes sir. People just need to accept that it's not there yet. Yes, cryptocurrencies have developed a great deal in a short time, but we're still in the very early adoption phase.
Besides, a block size increase does not equal usability as an everyday currency. First of all, the entire idea is based on a trustless system of payment. Decentralization is key. Increasing block size increases the cost of running a full node, which then decreases the number of people who can run one. That's moving towards centralization. Second, if Bitcoin were to adopt a larger block size, it would just be a matter of time before that'd be full as well. It's a bandaid for a severed limb. Without second layer solutions, cryptocurrency blockchains will never be viable as a means of everyday payment for everybody. That's why we need to demand SegWit from pretty much every entity that accepts bitcoin transactions. Then the road forward for LN is properly paved.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:26:12
What the bcash consensus thinks doesn't matter one iota (hah) to bitcoin. The hard fork already happened. It's already been determined that the large block advocates were the minority and bcash split from bitcoin. Done. Bitcoin goes on as always under the BTC ticker.

1) Had SegWit2X achieved consensus it should have been called Bitcoin, certainly. A minority that does its own thing against the will of the majority creates the forked chain. Bitcoin relies on consensus. If we can't trust that, we can't trust Bitcoin at all.
2) There can be lots of Bitcoins, absolutely. There already are! But clearly, we need to be able to differentiate between them.

It also coincides very well with the 60-day cycles we've been seeing for a year.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:07:21
Indeed. But bitcoin mining is becoming frighteningly centralized as it is and there's no reason to make it worse. It's peeing your pants to keep warm. Personally I think increasing the block size would be a mistake of epic proportions. We need to demand SegWit from exchanges/vendors/everybody - it's basically unacceptable that they're dragging their feet. And then give second layer solutions time to work. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:27:00
Not quite sure I'm getting it. You can just look up the transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:48:30
Fair enough. I will say it was sudden though. The Avalon miners started popping up early 2013, and the hash rate increased by an order of magnitude from spring to summer of that year.

Yeah, none of it has ever impacted a (real) market. Find somewhere else to troll.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:14:18
That's exactly what it is. Or, at least *one* such solution. There's a bunch of different threads about it here. Basically it all boils down to committing an amount of funds and then being able to make transactions that are not immediately written to the blockchain (hah, immediately being somewhat delayed thing these days), but rather you can have a heap of transactions take place and only the final sum of them gets written.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:09:01
Original direction of bitcoin is entirely subjective unless you're Satoshi, so that's not really a point that can be made. Also see the point made about Satoshi reducing the block size.
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:06:20
Know the difference between hacking bitcoin and hacking your way someplace that allows you to access someone's wallet. No hack here.
And it most certainly is a currency. Granted, adoption is low. But in Japan, people are getting paid wages in it. Pretty sure they think it's a currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:15:02
True, but still not quite. We aren't hearing their CEO telling everyone how bitcoin is dead or how he can't possibly imagine SegWit being at the top of any customer's priority list.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:51:23
I'm inclined to agree. We had a huge influx of dumb money in December, a long awaited correction, some additional FUD from Korea and China, then add to the mix the January dip if you believe in that sort of thing... I'm not the least bit surprised. Nor nervous.

1) Increasing the block size increases centralization, which is counterproductive in a decentralized currency. We're looking for trustless here. Also, no amount of extra block size will ever be enough - there can be no viable payment system without second layer solutions.
2) SegWit was necessary to enable second layer solutions like LN to work correctly (malleability).
3) LN is being developed just like everything else in the crypto universe. Go ahead and use it.
4) Of course BTC loses dominance - it was sitting on ~100% so there was only one way to go.

@_date: 2018-01-09 17:27:36
While I agree that increased adoption means an increased number of nodes, I think you're working off a flawed premise. Increased block size does not necessarily mean increased adoption. It absolutely does mean it gets more expensive to run a full node, which reduces the amount of people with the means to run one. If block size keeps expanding, fewer and fewer players will be able to. And besides, it's a bandaid when someone's had their leg ripped off. You'll never get where we need to go without second layer solutions.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:01:36
You don't think that would be harmful to crypto? I feel pretty certain the exchanges aren't just going to "rename coins". It's not their business to do so. It would likely harm their reputations as well. Except of course with the some people bcash crowd who lie awake thinking about this all night, every night. I assume you'd want the BCH ticker changed too, right? Or maybe just change the spelling to bitchoin (then running around telling everybody the h is silent). This is ridiculous.

That's what they say. Doesn't mean they get to take the name though. I'm pretty sure the Core developers feel that their work represents Satoshi's vision as well. Hell, let's say the bcash people get their way and hijack the Bitcoin name. Everybody starts calling bcash bitcoin. Then I fork their chain. Do I get to claim the bitcoin name then, since I feel I'm representing Satoshi's vision better? 
The fact remains: Bitcoin trades under the BTC ticker. That's not their currency.

Yeah that's pretty damn thin. I especially liked the part where he mentions bitcoin is trading sideways within a channel between 20000 and 12500. Now that's what I call a channel. So basically if we were to ramp straight back up to 19K, it'd still just be sideways trading within the channel. That's... yeah. Please stop smoking the funny stuff before doing technical analysis.

I don't see how that even applies. I absolutely do not advertise centralization in any way, shape or form. What I do is oppose concerted efforts to brand one cryptocurrency as another already existing cryptocurrency. It is false, misleading to newcomers and does nothing but damage the reputation and legitimacy of the crypto market as a whole. We've got enough scams going on already.  I've said nothing to indicate "there can be only one". Only that there can be only one of them called "bitcoin". I've hedged my bets and am still holding both BTC and BCH since the split. I'm no fanatical BTC supporter. The same goes for BCH. But I'm damn well not liking what some in the BCH crowd are up to at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:48:40


That's it in a nutshell. In the beginning, there was Bitcoin. Bitcoin evolved over time into what it is today. Some people disagreed with the direction development was taking and baboom: Hard fork. Fine. Disagreements occur. But when the general developer sentiment is against your ideas, development goes on against you. When this culminates in a hard fork, it doesn't mean the malcontent party gets to rebrand the original chain.
This sort of activity increases confusion and decreases trust in cryptocurrencies as a whole. We've got more than enough scam coins already.

Can you spend bitcoin in more or less places than two years ago? Has bitcoin been declared an actual currency in several countries? Do some companies offer to pay their employees in bitcoin? Adoption is most definitely growing. 
Yes, we're in the early stages still. Speculation is rampant. Transactions are expensive and slow due to much discussed technical issues. But that doesn't mean you can't spend bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-01-16 10:30:07

This is true. However there were many things Satoshi did not / could not foresee. He didn't see mining suddenly concentrated in a select group people who could afford to run an ASIC. From that perspective, even Bitcoin Gold could make a claim to being "closest to Satoshi's vision".

Simple. Fecking. Fact. 
If you're really so damn sure your solution is better, whatever the name you give it, it should shine on its own, shouldn't it? Why are you trying to hijack the name? I can't see any other reason than you're afraid bcash won't make it without help.

More importantly, we now have a few places we can actually spend bitcoin. We have a sliver of adoption. Yes, yes, it's too expensive blahblahblah, I hear you. But it's there. Lightning is coming. Adoption is going to follow the same chart Bitcoin price has been on this last year.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:02:37
December kind of put a huge dent in rational behaviour. You know something's going wrong when you check the price before bed, get up in the morning and manage to not be amazed that bitcoin is up another 1000 dollars for no reason in particular. 
Hopefully we can just drop and settle at a late November-ish level. And then pray the newcomers don't start another feeding frenzy. All this 1K up, 1K down every day volatility isn't really doing us any favours credibility-wise. Price changes have been insane all of last year, but from December until now it's been completely unhinged.

@_date: 2018-01-06 12:54:25
I never thought I'd say it, but I wish they would ignore SegWit and try to restore some semblance of basic functionality to their site. Like logging in without winding up with a CloudFlare timeout page every other attempt. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:48:50


Umm.. I'm thinking the exact opposite. Price runs up and down 1000+ dollars almost on a daily basis these days. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:52:11


That's a matter of adoption. I've bought several things with bitcoin already.

What is this HOLDING of which you speak?

Kraken has been notoriously flaky whenever there's any action price wise for at least the last half year. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:53:39
Absolutely. It's mindboggling, all this damned trading. I mean god damn, make up your minds people. Either bitcoin is good, or it's not. Make a decision and try to stick with it instead of buying and selling your coins five times a week because OMG crash / OMG moon launch. Don't let people manipulate the market. Make no mistake, there are people out there angling to buy your coin at a discount.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:49:25
You said it. Screw speculation, crypto wants to be a usable currency. Patience, grasshopper. We'll get there.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:51:21
I have a stake on that moon also. The people who know I have a bit of bitcoin keep asking me when I'm pulling out. I keep telling them they just don't get it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:52:07
Indeed. It's nothing short of mindblowing how anyone can consider him credible in any way, shape or form. His statements regarding Mt Gox should disqualify him from any serious crypto discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:21:52
I'd probably say the value comes from the complete lack of faith in the banking institutions instead of the last bit. That's usually something people can get behind.

I love my trezor. Was wondering how sturdy the things are so I started carrying one around with me whereever I go. It's been in my pocket for a year and it just keeps on trucking. And it reminds me [what to do.](
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:32:32
I hear ya. Bitcoin rallies, bitcoin corrects, sometimes bitcoin crashes. What else is new? Yes, what's just happened has a distinct smell of despicable people, but it's not the first time. It won't be the last time either. 
The only thing I know for sure is: Panic costs money.
So pop open a beer, zoom out your charts and consider the situation before freaking out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:40:14
Yeah that sounds about right. Panic-HODLing is my thing too.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:23:05
Are you sure? It seems to be a neverending pattern to me ;)
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:40:34
Great. I get all confused when I see strange words I'm unfamiliar with :P
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:23:53
And since everyone with a realistic bone in their body was expecting a major correction following a major rally, only every 5th number was a red one.

As an aircraft technician, let me just assure everyone that buying a private jet is a very, very safe and reliable way to negate any profits made from your crypto. :)

Agreed, people are too bloody impatient. Let the devs do their jobs and deliver solutions when they're ready. 
Right now we're basically on horseback for transportation, and wanting to instantaneously skip ahead to space shuttles - you know, so we can go to the moon. Patience.

Just plain, simple, ordinary hysteria fueling a market move. Business as usual. Every time this happens it's "but this time it's different". Over and over and over again. I'll just stick with the IDGAF approach. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:28:14
I expect to eventually buy myself a second one with BTC :P
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:59:35
That's why you don't do that - you ladder in and out, always. It's downright incredible this isn't common sense to everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:12:26
And which developer team has managed this? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:38:47
That's true. Present events do not change anything regarding the tech either. And now we have countries regarding bitcoin as legal tender.
No, we can't draw any conclusions from the past. But Bitcoin could bounce back from the gigantic shitstorm that was EmptyGox, back when it was a weird blip somewhere in a dark, musty back room of the internet. Now it's legal tender in Japan. An entire industry sprung up around it. If there ever was a likely time for Bitcoin to kick the bucket, this is certainly NOT it.

Weeding out the crap can only benefit us.
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:41:22
A sorely missed point, I'd say. Keep the bulk of it locked away safe somewhere off the exchange, and trade the remaining fraction whatever it might be. 
Never, ever make 100% moves. Ladder in, ladder out - you won't get the optimum result, but you're far less likely to make a big mistake and get mauled by an unexpected market move.

Smoking cigarettes = risky.
Buying bitcoin = risky.
You're a regular daredevil ;)
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:33:31
Sure, the profit takers can choose to appreciate the tech. But clearly, they're more about finding an investment vehicle. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:31:32


That's the point. *Everyone* signifies a consensus can be reached. BCH forked off because of inability to agree on proposed changes. Hence, it is a minority chain and not Bitcoin. Which the creators are perfectly well aware of.... they did choose the name Bitcoin Cash on their own, didn't they?
The fraud talk comes into play when people start buying BCH because they've been led to think it is Bitcoin. It's truly scummy behaviour.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:03:46
Yeah, just saw Bitfinex now has a 24 hour volume of 167121. Slightly above average, one might say.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:23:15
Hold on a second there mister. It's cheese. It's ALWAYS a good idea :P
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:16:19


It's almost funny how you don't get it. If you had 1 bitcoin in December and held on to it, you still have 1 bitcoin. Zero holdings lost. It's never a loss until you realize it by selling.
You're the one thinking in dollars. Clearly, you do not believe cryptocurrency is anything but an investment vehicle for you to exploit. People like that are what caused the overheated market in the first place. 
Let the hodlers hodl. Make fun of us all you like if it makes you feel better. People said we were stupid after Gox as well.
As for the answer to your original question: It's working out just fine. Hodlers can't be faulted for everyone else seemingly having the same problem as the guy from "Memento". See if you can dig out some long term memory somewhere in the back. History goes back a little further than two months.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:42:20
Indeed. Increasing the block size will never get us anywhere close to solving the problem in front of us. It's a bucket of water to fill an ocean. Sure, it can be increased; it likely will be at some point. But it can never be the solution on its own... it's just a way of postponing the problem. And having the unfortunate side effect of making it more and more problematic to run a full node. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:28:02
For a fraud, they sure process a lot of transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:07:08
Sure it is. According to Webster's:
Something transacted; especially :an exchange or transfer of goods, services, or funds.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:26:09
Well, if that's true they're taking their time buying anything. Certainly not keeping up with the sell volume.
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:29:53
Indeed. But you know there has to be more than a few in there when the market can bleed 10 billion on an unsubstantiated rumor in the time it took me to sweep my driveway. The volatility is just staggering sometimes.
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:20:51


Always give yourself room to react to the unexpected.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:28:26
If you've been around for more than one crash, you know exactly what they'll say. Over and over and over again. Bitcoin = Dead. Bubble. Obsolete. We've heard it all before. It's a cycle.
Disregard what *everyone* says about what happens next - nobody knows the future no matter what their "analysis" shows. As has been proven in this market time and time again. Do a bit of investigating what Bitcoin is. Decide for yourself whether or not this kind of tech has a place in the world. Then either buy some or don't. 
And if you absolutely have to trade... ffs stop reacting to market moves after they already happened. That's how you lose your money. We've just witnessed a major downturn from the other side of 19K. Selling at 6K... omg! A bit late, aren't you? Sometimes I swear people are actively trying to see how cheap they can get rid of their BTC. When in doubt... just hold your coin and try to see more than a few weeks or months into the future.
Bitcoin is not dying. It's from the Iron Islands, okay?

The existence of cryptocurrency and the terminology associated with it did not redefine the word "transaction". 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:15:02
Yes. But you'd need a crystal ball to tell.

What's really mind boggling is the amount of weak hands there are. One would think we'd have gotten rid of the worst lot in the first dump earlier this week. I guess they must have bought back in, eh? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:46:08
The hodlers aren't jumpy. If they are, they're probably not really hodlers, are they?
