Personally I'm an atheist, but, didn't the Bible predict something like this though. 
Everyone will turn their backs on God, or something like that

Right, but the argument could be made that it was not God at all. Maybe Abbadon, maybe Satan? Maybe humans are just goddamn terrible, and they try to justify anything to make them feel better.

For being selfish, humans sure are interesting to me.
