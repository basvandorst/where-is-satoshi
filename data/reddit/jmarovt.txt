This is more about coins that have real value aka Bitcoin et al.

One of the creators of Coincall here - that's a good point. We'll think about it and potentially add it. Tnx!

Here's also the full crypto �� announcement:

Interesting, tnx!

Yup, the site is shaky, at least on the front-end side. They need to step it up seriously.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:08:57
Of course it doesn't mean much. 
But look at their list of investors ( and you'll see some known names from the Bitcoin investment community (Chris Dixon, Founders Fund etc.). They are probably pitching Bitcoin as we speak.
On the other hand, Sequoia seems to have a massive share of the company and its Mike Moritz (who sits on the board) has previously expressed skepticism towards Bitcoin (
Those board meetings must be awesome.

Another interesting point: Khosla Ventures and its Keith Rabois recently led a massive financing round in Stripe. The guy used to be high up in PayPal and does not look optimistically on Bitcoin (at least in the states): 
Btw. there seems to be half of Paypal mafia invested in this company: Thiel, Elon, Rabois ...

They have 2FA, you just need to enable it in the settings.

Thanks for the typos, will fix!
Mochizuki and Nash are good leads. Will research more and add. Thanks again!
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:18:42
Yeah, that was my initial idea too. But I didn't want to draw additional attention to the poor man who is obviously not the real Satoshi. Might reconsider, thanks for your input!
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:00:34
Tnx for this thoughtful comment!
So from my research, it seemed very unlikely that any of the three people I mentioned created Bitcoin by themselves. All of them had at least one strong argument against it.
It could have been a completely random 3rd person creating it by themselves, but there are too many arguments pointing in direction of Szabo being at least partially involved (writing style, no citation of his work in the whitepaper, him changing timestamps of his bit gold posts to a date after the whitepaper was released, etc.).
That said, I will take a bit more time and dig into this. Do you potentially have any pointers to Szabo's code?
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:27:49
Ok, this slip up is pretty meaningful. Might include it in the post later, tnx!
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:22:01
Haha, just HODL, don't stress ;)
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:28:20
Thanks, that's right, will fix!
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:21:20
Well, tried to pull together all the interesting info on Satoshi that's available out there. Finding his or her identity, with the information we currently have, is unfortunately impossible :(
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:45:01
Thanks! Currently category definitions are not set in stone. I just made them up "on the fly" as they made sense to me.
Platform = vey versatile service with consumer wallet, ability to purchase/sell bitcoins, a merchant platform and an API
Good idea about putting definitions somewhere on the side!
Also: if you know any other services, let me know.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:48:46
Just bought it. Great price. Keep it going!
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:57:33
I think all the mentioned "platform" companies are brokers as well. But there are also so much more and have, what I consider really important once we get to scale, developer APIs.
Thanks for those 2, will check! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:53:03
But I guess targeting the world? (I put home countries in parenthesis.)
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:47:56
Tnx, just added. Looks solid!
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:24:51
This kind of rounds are typically around 20%. So, in this case post-money valuation would come around $125M.
Because this is a very hot deal, the number might be as low as 15%. Post-money valuation would then come around $166M. 
So, IMO, Coinbase is currently valued somewhere between $125M-$166M. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:31:06
Tnx! I'm slightly new to reddit, but will try to figure out a good way to do it.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:55:00
Honestly, wouldn't know much about it.
From what I can see there are quite a few exchanges and trading platforms on the list, that make it possible to trade litecoins as well. But haven't seen services/companies specifically dedicated to the litecoin ecosystem at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:19:03
Tnx! 
If you know any good services that I'm missing, let me know. I intentionally skipped quite a few that didn't look very promising or didn't reveal much about what they are doing.

The most interesting thing about it is the support for multi-signature wallets:
Really interested in what you guys think of it.
