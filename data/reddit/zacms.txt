Ya, thats what they said on their site, but I'm not entirely convinced that nicehash didn't just use shapeshift or some other service to exchange alt coins for Bitcoin. I'm not sure how deep the market is for people looking to rent hashing power and there were a lot of people using nicehash to mine. I never meant to imply that nicehash actually mined anything.

No, not necessarily, some of them have new and different technologies that Bitcoin and other alt coins don't have. Each alt coin has its own strengths and weakness, diffrenet featutes, many people mine coins that they feel are superior to the rest based on their functionality.

Maybe in the future, but not yet. There are new alt coins popping up all the time too, you could always switch to a newer coin if you think the tech looks promising.

Anyone mining with a single 1070 isnt really driving up graphics card prices. Probably just another gamer utilizing their computers downtime for something productive

I'm sure there are some. Most commercial miners run specialized hardware that is really only useful for mining Bitcoin, most alt coins have algorithms that are resistant to purpose built hardware. Basically they are designed in a way such that consumer hardware is your only option for mining (at least so far).
There definitely are people out there with rooms filled with consumer graphics cards that switch their hashing power based on what gives them the best return. They are the ones that are responsible for the recent rise in graphics card prices.

You're right, you probably could, at least with coins that have open ledgers. Maybe in the coming days someone will do the analysis and find out thanks to this hack.

Personally I'm a fan of monero, but it all depends on your specific. Nicehash was nice because it basically picked the most profitable alt coin for you and just paid you in BTC. Whattomine.com is a good resource that can help you pick a good alt coin to mine.

You can't mine Bitcoin with consumer hardware, however there are a number of alt coins that are highly profitable to mine with consumer hardware. Nicehash bridged the gap. You would mine alt coins with your hardware. Nicehash would then take the alt coins, trade the alt coins for Bitcoin and send you Bitcoin.

In this day and age there's almost no point in saving fiat anymore. Central banks around the world have pushed interest rates so far down and printed so much new money that there's really no incentive to save traditional money. 
Don't be too hard on yourself OP the system is setup to encourage you to spend everything and save nothing.

Gold may go down vs the USD but it generally maintains the same level of purchasing power in terms of other hard assets.

It really depends how nations around the world act during the next financial crisis. If they try to print their way out of the next recession, like they did with the last one, the price of BTC relative to USD will shoot up, because the value of the dollar will plummet. 
If they let markets crash and deflate then the price of Bitcoin will likely deflate the same as every other bubble. But your purchasing power with Bitcoin may remain similar.

Well I see what you are saying, but Bitcoin may be a game changer. Unlike gold it can't be siezed and can easily be transfered out of country. Which could be important in a large scale financial disaster that goes global. And like gold there is a limited supply of it so politicians can't print it into worthlessness.
