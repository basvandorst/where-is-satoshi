In what alternate universe is Montreal on the coast?
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:42:12
Is it absolutely necessary? Maybe not. But it certainly gives the customer a better sense of security. Personally, I like that they are using 2FA.
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:54:26
Sure it does. But Montreal does not. Quebec City is closer to the ocean than Montreal and is still not "on the coast".
That's like saying Dallas is on the coast because Texas is coastal.
EDIT: I love how I'm getting downvoted for correcting an obvious factual error. Guys, I live in this part of the world. NO ONE in Montreal thinks they live on the coast, nor does anyone who *actually* lives on the Canadian coast.

And the thing is, *almost everyone* who has ever bought bitcoin at ANY price is up right now. Only those few who bought at the ATH from last month are still down a couple hundred, but if they wait a bit, they will more than likely be up too.
When I bought at $80 after the crash in April, people said it was crazy. When I bought at $100 in July, people said it was crazy. When I bought at $200 in November, people REALLY said it was crazy.
Who's crazy now?
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:44:12
I know and it's crazy. They haven't actually "lost" anything until they sell. So they they panic sell and complain that they lost money. Way too many people around here who don't have the nerve to be invested in anything this volatile.

Wrong. It is in the St. Lawrence river, which is not "the coast". It connects to the Atlantic, sure, but so does *every river on the eastern seaboard*. 
 Nova Scotia is the coast. Newfoundland is the coast. New Brunswick is the coast. Montreal is in no way, shape or form on the coast.
The fact that you called it "the largest coastal *state*" makes me sincerely hope that you have never been to Canada and are hopefully from somewhere other than the U.S., in which case the mistake can be excused.

As someone said in the r/bitcoinmarkets daily thread yesterday, bitcoin is like the cocaine of investing. Once you get used to the massive swings and daily (hourly?) sentiment changes, it becomes incredibly hard to look at your boring old stocks with their 5-10% gains the same way.

Yeah, "destroyed" their private key. Right after someone wrote it down.
If this had happened in 2011, sure. But when this happened last May, there was huge attention already and the price had already spiked over $200 (and fallen under, but still).

I dunno. I'm Canadian so I use Virtex. And maybe Gox is okay but with everything that's happened there this week I certainly wouldn't send them any money. The price is low there because no one can get their coins out so they are selling them.

@_date: 2013-10-28 15:16:41
Agree with all of this. 
Don't end up becoming BTC-E where they add a new currency every couple of weeks based on what seems like the changing whims of their users. 
For Canadians, you've already got a big plus over Viretx in your fees. What you don't have (for me and many traders) is the volume, as you well know. Focus on building BTC volume and the traders will come. Temporary 0% fees would go a long way towards getting people to give you a shot.

Just buy small quantities over time. Then you are [averaging out your cost](
Sometimes you will buy high, sometimes low and it tends to even out. 
I've been doing that for the past 5 months and my average buy in (including buying some yesterday at 193) is $116.
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:21:41
There will almost certainly be a drop. The question is when. If it shoots up to $1,000 and then drops to $500, that's a 50% drop but you should have bought at $200.

I would think that the best way to approach this would be to market yourself and what you have to offer first, without focusing only on people with Bitcoin. 
Once you've found a few potential clients and had people show interest in your services, you can then mention how Bitcoin is your preferred method of payment ("What's Bitcoin? Well, let me show you..!").

@_date: 2013-12-02 10:03:09
Who cares if it's premined? To me that's only an issue if they try to hide that fact, which they clearly don't. The trading volume of Quark coin is insane. Let the distribution and decentralization happen via a free market. To me, that almost seems like a better system than ASIC miners jogging all of the hash rate, doesn't it?
On top of that, Quark is the only coin out there with a unique hashing algorithm and multiple levels of security. Regardless of whether or not that means it's actually better is irrelevant. It gives it a hell of a leg up perception-wise. Based on that alone I could legitimately see Quark outcompeting Litecoin for day to day transactions.
I am not invested in Quark and have nothing to do with them, but I've been reading a lot about it and I have to admit, it seems like one of the very few coins to offer something fundamentally different from all of the bit clones.

@_date: 2013-11-07 00:22:31
The main reason people around here say that is because we've all seen people who sold at what they thought was a good price come back months later and hate themselves for it.
But I agree with you 100% -- everyone has their own situation and needs to do what's right for them. Just don't panic sell because you think it's crashing. The price of bitcoin moves around a LOT.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:18:30
It did exist. Bitmit. But it shut down.
@_date: 2013-10-20 00:42:34
But it won't break even. That's what they're saying. The chance of ROI on pretty much any miner on the market right now is suspect, if not next to zero.
Once the next generation of ASICs is rolling, those will be profitable for the first few buyers, just like the current version, and FPGA before that, and GPU before that, and CPU before that.
Listen man, I get where your head is at, I truly do. But it's a pipe dream. Mining is not profitable for the little (or even medium-sized) man anymore. We missed the boat.
Just buy BTC directly with that $12,000 and I guarantee that you will see a better ROI.
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:27:09
Like all other ASIC miners right now, this will never ROI and will generate a considerable net loss. Buyer beware.
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:36:34
Very true. 
I usually convert into BTC immediately, but you could hold and perhaps make more. Or less.
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:11:27
I mine scrypt coins with two Radeon 7950's (arguably the 2nd best GPU available for mining) and make about $2 a day. 
I don't pay for electricity so yes that's technically profit, if you want to call it that. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:13:13
I get slightly over 0.5 LTC/day at current difficulty. If you could run both at max you could get close to 1 LTC/day, however they are beasts of cards and with two of them installed directly in the MB, even with a high end gaming case with 8 fans, I can only run one of them at 75% due to overheating (the other is at 100%).
Yes there are ways to max them out, but for the slight increase in income, I really don't care. They paid themselves off when I could still easily mine BTC with them.
The point is that for new people thinking about mining, GPU mining is no longer financially feasible even for alt coins (unless you already own the gear).  
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:51:30


Don't store your bitcoins in online wallets.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:32:03
Lower volume on Virtex is one reason. In other words, it takes a smaller purchase to move the price a lot.
@_date: 2013-09-30 09:02:24
Definitely missed it. Most miners will never see ROI with the difficulty increases we've had the last few months, and it's only going to get worse as more gear comes online. If you had started in June or even July you might have made it. But even then would have been tight.
Definitely better off to buy and hold bitcoins themselves at this stage.
@_date: 2013-10-27 10:37:22
It just needs to be massively more simple to use for non-technical people. I work in IT and it took me a good bit of researching to get it all worked out when I first got involved. You can't expect people who have no interest in programming/computers to get past that barrier to entry on their own.
In fact, I think this is the single biggest threat to mass adoption that bitcoin faces today. It needs to be ELI5 simple for the average person to use, but still have the security that makes it attractive.
Tall order, I know, but that's what needs to happen. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:27:11
When I first bought in at the bottom of the April crash, I doubled my money in 7 days, cashed out half and bought a new computer. Since then I have doubled my money twice more, once through buying low in the SR crash and once from Asicminer stocks in July.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:45:23
Fair enough. My point is simply that GPU mining isn't the money maker it was even a few months ago. I see a lot of new people asking "how much can I make with my GPU?" and they need to know that that ship has largely sailed.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:17:39
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:55:06
Volume always seems to go down on the weekends. I think it largely has to do with getting money into the exchanges, like mentioned above. I think there might also be a lot of people just waiting to see if the price goes down before buying. If a run starts next week (which I believe it has a better than average chance of doing) I expect it will pick up steam quickly. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:40:21
What these guys are saying is that you will lose money on pretty much any miner available on the market today. ANY miner. I don't believe there is one out there right now that will give you a decent shot at ROI. But don't take my word for it:

I told my wife the first time my initial investment doubled (back in April) and now she's on board and gets excited about it too. 
She knows that we are many multiples up on the amount I put in, and that we could theoretically lose most of it, but letting her in on it allowed us to discuss together what our "exit number" would be (enough to clear all debts), and that number is not that far away.
By involving her in the process, rather than her saying "cash it all out now and we can be free and clear", she is very much of the same mind as me: cash out only when our total holding is enough that we can keep at least half of our bitcoin and still help ourselves today.

One of my favorite ways to lay it out for people:
If you can amass 21 BTC (not totally impossible but quickly getting out of reach for a lot of people), mathematically no more than 999,999 can ever have as much BTC as you do. 
1 million people sounds like a lot, but it puts you in the top one-hundredth of one percent (0.01%) of humans living on the planet today. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 15:23:20
I'll be honest. IMO (which may not be worth much), I'm seeing a lot of these 'new physical bitcoin' designs lately, and they all suffer from the same, probably insurmountable, problem: 
They aren't [Casascius]( coins.
Casascius got a really early jump on the physical coin market and his coins are used in nearly *every* news article, blog post, banner ad, header, etc. The Casascius coin has become *the* look of bitcoin in the minds of a lot of people and I think it's going to be very hard to carve out more than a small niche of what is already a very niche market. 
I own Casascius coins and people who aren't even into bitcoin immediately recognize them because they have seen the picture all over the place. I personally wouldn't buy physical bitcoins other than these because I think (perhaps incorrectly) that they will be harder to sell than Casascius because he has a huge jump in perception that his coins are what a bitcoin looks like.

This is key. Those of us who have been around bitcoin for a while have learned that these drops (which DO happen) are, if anything, buying opportunities. Don't panic and lose half of your investment because you think it's "crashing". If it's really crashing, you'll know.
@_date: 2013-10-29 10:48:12

I disagree that they don't want temporary micro-subscribers. That's probably not their ideal scenario, sure, but times are changing. Micro-subscribers are better than no subscribers at all. 
Personally, I would pay a reasonable amount for time-limited access to the G&amp;M in a heartbeat. I'm not paying $19.99/month for it.  
EDIT: Also, you're wrong about Bitcoin not "allowing" recurring payments. The Coinbase API (and others, I'm sure) can do exactly that.

Exactly. But Canada has a history of being a bit of a 'testing ground' for the US when it comes to unproven technologies. We had each stage of internet and phone technology considerably earlier than the States in most cases. This gap has largely disappeared, but I remember in the '90's and early 2000's being shocked to learn that things we'd had for years were just emerging in the US.

Very good point.

Actually the 7950's were still decent for low level mining in early 2013. I have two that I mined with until July or so when the difficulty went bananas.

I grew up right alongside the personal computer revolution (got my first when I was four -- a Texas Instrument TI-99) and I was in high school when the Internet really became a thing.
I see a lot of parallels with bitcoin. 
I feel like we're just at the stage where interested, fully capable, but maybe non-technical folks are getting involved in growing numbers. We're just emerging from the era where it was only really small groups of dedicated hobbyists who were involved and into the part where the technology becomes *slightly* more mainstream. From really early adopters to 'cool' factor. 
Simply going with my gut feeling, I'd put where we are right now with bitcoin at right around 1981-82 if you compare it to the personal computer revolution (just as Commodore 64 was being introduced to the market and the Apple II and Vic-20 had been top of the line machines for a couple of years). Maybe even a couple of years earlier. But we're definitely moving into the second stage.

Because buyers want to pay less than market price.

Oh yeah, I know. I've had tons of issues with them not related to BTC. That's why I don't do my regular banking with them anymore and just keep the account for BTC purposes and paying bills.

Well mine tells me I made $14, so you can't say it's "not true". For me, it is.

No problem at all with RBC (so far).

Usually 10% of every paycheck. 10% to debt, 10% to regular fiat savings account, 10% to RRSP and 10% to bitcoin.

More than I did last week.

Not true. This reeks of FUD. Up until a few months ago, you couldn't easily buy bitcoin through your bank account anyway. You used wire transfers and cash payments and things like that for the first 3.5 years of bitcoin's existence. The worst that happens is we go back to that. So the new people lose a bit of convenience. Oh well. Shit happens. It will in no way stop people from buy or selling bitcoin.
