This would probably take up most of the 7 minutes if you want a chance for them to (even vaguely) see what is going on..

Make sure the chicken doesn't cross the road though.

Do you think it might possibly have something to do with the fact that I wasn't the most specific as to the particulars of this parking lot in particular? Have you checked you are at the one with all the cars parked all around and the white lines on the ground?

The guy has cancer, so I really hope he takes the money and uses it for that.
@_date: 2014-03-18 09:28:57
Sure! Let's go!

Is GangnamCoin really a coin? This is awesome. How would you mine that?
@_date: 2014-02-09 13:54:49
Thank you so much for this. At last something that calms down the hysteria.

I'm not rooting for either side, but they do have a few papers in their documentation, including this one: 
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:08:24
Source or example in past history? (Genuine question)
@_date: 2014-03-18 09:28:21
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:26:01
still down for me, actually
@_date: 2014-01-08 08:16:57
Let's meet in an underground parking lot at 2am. What could possibly go wrong?

The first thing someone on reddit wants to do when they see "don't x" is to x. Is this a trick to get to the front page?

Wait, subway takes bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:35:18
Just wait a bit, it will go back up. This is the conjunction of some guy selling at 102$ and people freaking out more than is reasonable about Mt Gox having a technical problem.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:59:51
I have just been able to withdraw 0.3 BTC from Gox.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:40:32
That's a real gotcha right there
@_date: 2014-03-20 11:41:06
Same here.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:28:34
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:27:18
not for me
@_date: 2014-03-13 09:41:47
Is this a public event? If not, are you talking to the whole senate or only those from a single political party? And if yes, how can one attend?
@_date: 2014-02-16 00:44:28
How about an mp3 direct download? I'd like to listen to it offline..
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:23:56
I agree with pluribusblanks' points personally, but won't these people be more bent towards regulation and thus be alarmed when speaking of going around the banking system?
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:48:00
I know that. I meant to ask what the sentence was supposed to meant. Vice versa here reads like when you're smart at everything doesn't mean you're smart at a particular thing, which doesn't make much sense.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:45:25
Which in itself can give you a pause as to whether this guy is SN. Can't you even buy a decent lunch for a few hundred million dollars in LA anymore?

I think one interesting angle would be what it can bring in terms of democracy, development and emancipation around the world, since France likes to see itself as a propagator of those values:
- Bitcoin the currency can help entrepreneurs in corrupt countries (e.g. China, Russia, etc...) avoid having to bribe officials because it removes part of their leverage through the local banking systems (although this might backfire because they don't want people circumventing the banking system in France). If I remember correctly, this is a point made by A.M.Antonopoulos.
- It can also help small companies in developping countries by being able to become international businesses by accepting bitcoins, but also clients of French businesses;
- Bitcoin the protocol has potential applications in truly secure, anonymous and unriggable voting systems.
- Software like Bitmessage, directly inspired by Bitcoin, and although still imperfect at the moment, has the potential of helping dissidents in authoritarian regimes communicate safely and anonymously.
- Namecoin, with a decentralized DNS system, can break the current U.S based system (what Frenchman doesn't like a little American bashing :-) )
That's all I can think of around this theme now. If I think of anything else I'll add it.

I was really aiming at the first post, I didn't really pay attention to the amount of your bet :-)

Yes, they were reserved for the supreme leader.
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:06:48
Chuck Norris can double spend. Your bitcoins.

I couldn't imagine giving away 0.5 BTC to someone that stupid. It's like lending your brand new car to you alcoholic uncle.
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:57:30
It is! And it could easily be funded every year. 1000 BTC crowdfunded? That's like a day of trading fees :-)
