I had to send a second email but they did fix this for me today.

He hasn't been active all week.
Some of us are having issues with getting a different rate for our purchases than what was indicated both on their website and via their support:

How does the cancellation option work?
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:44:00
I would avoid them for now. 
I posted about my experience with coinbase [here](
After placing an order to buy four bitcoins and seeing my trade pending, I emailed coinbase to see what price I would end up getting once the transaction was completed and got the following response:


Of course there was no option to cancel, and when I emailed support they were no help.  I figured I would just let the transaction clear at the future exchange rate when the funds cleared.
This morning my funds from my bank cleared and later today the transaction was completed, however I only received 4BTC (they used the exchange rate from when I placed the order) instead of the 10 and change I should have received using the current rate they have listed ~$90/BTC.
Some [other redditors]( are having the same problem.

I got a response back from support:


Problem is I don't see the button to cancel either?!?!

I received the same message the first few times I tried to buy through coinbase.  It's a rolling limit so I figured that means that some buying capacity would open up throughout the day.  I opened my account and linked it a checking account around 11:30 AM EST.  I tried buying about once or twice an hour and finally purchased four bitcoins around 4PM EST.  
I am assuming I locked in the current price at 4PM EST (~235USD/BTC) as the transaction detail listed on the coinbase website says:
Amount Received 4.00 BTC
From: Coinbase
To: You
Date: April 09, 2013 at 12:55PM PDT
Status: Pending - Your BTC will arrive on Friday Apr 12, 2013 around 01:55PM PDT after the bank transfer has completed
Notes: Paid for with $941.47 from xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

The buying cap was hit all day on Tuesday.  I received the message under (2) and assumed I was buying under that scenario.  Their support team also confirmed this for me.

I was going to call my bank last night and even dialed the number but had to run to meet my gf before I got on the line with someone.  Good luck.
Emailed coinbase support and trying to get my account credited with the correct amount of bitcoins.  Couple other people had the same issue: 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:32:34
I would avoid coinbase, they're not delivering the amount of bitcoins they're supposed to be delivering:

I'm not registered on that forum but thanks for pointing it out.  They haven't replied to my last email from yesterday - were you successful at getting them to cancel the order?
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:20:33
I emailed support today and this was corrected.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:02:32
I sent a email into support - I'm sure they're inundated.  I may find out sooner just by waiting for my transaction to clear!
I hope your edit is the correct case, it does make sense as it is less risky for both the user and coinbase.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:21:00
I had the same issue today, I emailed them and hopefully they will correct it.  I agree, it's fucked.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:16:47
They updated the site, you now get this message:








@_date: 2013-04-12 21:22:40
I did.  Hopefully it will be corrected.
Seems like other people are having the same problem [here](
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:07:27
Well this is terrible, my transaction was completed but I received only 4BTC for the $941 transfer that went through....
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:08:01
I replied to their reply yesterday and also sent another via the website.  Hopefully one or the other does the trick.  
Otherwise, I'll just take the coins, move them to an exchange and sell them.  Hopefully I'll be able to get out with just a small hit, or in a ideal scenario even a small profit.  We'll see.  At this point I'd rather just cancel and avoid the hassle.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:28:03
They replied and said they can't cancel now that the bank transfer has been initiated.
I may call up my bank tonight and try to reverse it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:42:44
Any luck getting your order canceled?  The buy/sell spread on coinbase is about $70!  That's insane. The spread on mtgox right now for example is only $5-6 between the bid/ask.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:39:04
Just happened to me too.  I emailed support, quoting a previous email from them.  Let me know if you were able to get this resolved.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:22:02
Have you tried?  
I got that message a few times but it wouldn't let me actually put a transaction through.  After waiting a bit, and trying a few times during the day I was actually able to buy.
I bought four bitcoins yesterday around 4PM when the price was ~235.  My transaction is currently listed as Pending.  The current status is listed as follows:
Status: Pending - Your BTC will arrive on Friday Apr 12, 2013 around 01:55PM PDT after the bank transfer has completed.
Notes: Paid for with $941.47 from xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Obviously if the price continues to fall I'd love to go ahead and cancel the order.  
Although I'm also wondering if they're just going to credit me $941 worth of bitcoin whenever my funds clear?
