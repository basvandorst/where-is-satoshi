I think that's what I'm going to have to do. I have a bitcoin so I'll just sell it now and transfer the money to my account. :/

I have never felt so many clenched butt holes in unison before, I kinda like it.

All of my coin is from this year. I only started buying this February so either way it'll be on my taxes if I sell.

That makes sense, but just last week I had used the ACH to buy coins and it only took three days from the day of purchase until I had the coins in my dashboard. I guess its just random. I'm still new to the whole buying/selling. Thanks for the info!

That's actually a good point, I might look into that tomorrow morning. Thanks!

That actually makes me feel a little better, thanks dude! :) happy it worked out for you though.

Haha it's the damn Wendy's that's gonna fuck me good. I knew I shouldn't have gotten those two junior bacon cheeseburgers. With coinbase you have to wait 7 days for the coins to show up in your account, so hopefully the price either stays the same or doesn't drop too badly. That would be pretty neat if it worked out in my favor though.

Awesome, thank you! I've been looking at  Gemini, I've just been used to Coinbase. I'm getting a little tired of their response time and constant crashing whenever there is news. I think I'll make the switch to Gemini now after the 2 week wait time. That .025% fee sounds really nice too. I tend not to sell unless I really need the money. but that's definitely a cool feature.

Feynman technique is great for this stuff.
