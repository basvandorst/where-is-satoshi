Foundations that are savvy should consider to keep some of their Bitcoin donation into cold storage in the form of Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be worth anything between 10 to 1000 times more in just few years when all the institutional players join in. If Wikipedia kept even 10 % of their donation into Bitcoin they would not need to worry for further donations for many years to come when Bitcoin makes it big.

How am I tailoring? I made very simple assumptions. 
1) there is an underlying logistic model explaining the growth of users pattern
2) the total number of users will reach 1 billion users
These are pretty reasonable assumptions.

When we send probe to Mars we make also assumptions and use models. 
Physicists and mathematicians use several assumptions and models applied to financial analysis and hedge funds adopting these models have made many people extremely wealthy: they do work.

In fact, the price follows a very predictable power law that is very close to Metcalfe theoretical prediction. The empirical law for Bitcoin is that the price is proportional to the number of users to the power of 1.7 while Metcalfe predicts 2. 
Still pretty amazingly good. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 15:14:40
NO ! Otherwise science would not exist. There is signal and there is noise. Past growth can predict future growth of course ! It is true in many systems from biology to cities. Of course at a point the growth stop, the right mathematical model is called a logistic curve. Look it up. The point is to understand the time scale under which the growth will happen. Bitcoin has a long way to go before saturating and leaving the exponential growth. It will take at least another 3-4 years. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:38:47
It doesn't work in this way. The motivation of single agents is not important. Of course they join the network because they see some advantage. The ant does the same when it "joins" the colony. It benefits from it. But the rate of growth of the number of users has nothing to do really with the motivation of the single agents. The attractiveness of the network as whole is important of course but that is what determines the growth rate per se. There are more important factors though that are the propagation of the information given the current technological media. My main point is that these factors are not random and once established determine in a very predictable way the evolution of the system. They become characteristic of the system. In fact, as the system grows it becomes even more stable because it has its own momentum and it is very difficult to make it change its course. The only factor that will change the exponential growth is saturation. This why the real underlying model to use is a logistic curve (the famous S shape of adoption).

But the order of adoption is strongly correlated on how well you were prepared to understand BTC and mining it and get involved with it. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:17:10
Also what confuses people is the stability of price over few weeks or sudden jumps and so on. This is noise. The system is stochastic of course. But even there it follows precise mathematical laws (it is a Pareto distribution, look it up). Again that is what data shows. So there is a general trend that is supported on time scales of months with a stochastic noise behavior on top. But noise is irrelevant over scales of months and years. If you are long time investor the noise is meaningless. Right now for example the price of BTC is about 60 percent ABOVE the trend line, so it is perfectly ok for the price to stay put for few weeks or even go down a bit, but if you zoom out and look at the trend over months or years then the trend line is what is dominant. That is what counts for a long term investor.

Plot price vs price in a loglog graph and then fit. You would not get a slope of 2. It is more 1.45 if you use last year prices for Bitstamp and 1.7 if you use 3 years data from Mt. Gox.

@_date: 2014-03-30 15:36:15
Notice I do not use the price as a function of time to predict anything. I used a model that is a well established model for adoption of technologies and fitted to the empirical data of the growth of users of the network. 
Then I applied the observed power law between users and price to predict the price value and made the observation the trend is in between two theoretical predictions, one that is an idealistic upper limit and another that is a more realistic one that has already shown to work for other social networks for example Facebook. 
So it is not just playing with numbers but fitting models to empirical data that is what science does all the time with extremely good track record.

Well, if you do something more mathematically meaningful, that is to fit an exponential to the the price over the last 3.5 years you get a trend line that will tell you what is the baseline value of BTC. We have deviated very little from this baseline over time scales of months. There have been times before where the price was flat to jump and then oscillate around the trend line. The fit is statistically significant more than usual social or economical data are generally. Right now we are actually about 60 percent above the trend line so it is ok for the price to flat for a little while. We are still going to the moon but we are parked for a rest stop because we ahead of schedule. Let's wait as you said a little longer on time scales of few months. By March the price should be higher than now significantly and stay there without going back below 1000. Let's see if that happens.

People talk rubbish when they say invest what you feel you can do without and nonsense like that. Bitcoin is a 1 time life opportunity. Investing 20 K now at your age is something you can recover pretty quickly and you WOULD NOT lose it. Bitcoin would not go to zero. It can go just up now for long time to come. But even so, even if it could go to zero (it is more likely an asteroid hits the earth) 20 K loss is not a big deal at 26 given your income. But what is the other side of this? You could become a millionaire in few years. It is not a lottery ticket, the chances that your money will double or become 10 or 100 times more than now in few years is more than 80 % at this point. Bitcoin could have died in its early days, it didn't. The network is too strong to be killed by any government and if anything we see the major players as US trying to accept it and regulate it. Look at all the smart money that is pouring in the economy. Research it. Look at how many multi-million start ups are investing in the BTC economy. You are an angel investor in BTC. Very few people have such opportunities in life.

When you are considering exponential growth factors of few are really meaningless. Imagine that you have a population that is doubling every second. Let's say you want to know how much it takes to reach a billion limit for this population. Let's say it takes 10 years to reach 500 million. How long it would take to reach 1 billion? 
Just one more second. 
Think about that and see what factors of 2 mean when you are dealing with exponential growth. 
They are meaningless. 
So it doesn't matter if you start with 1 million or 300,000. What matters is the order of magnitude and these numbers are basically the same from a magnitude point of view.

Do not use Bitcoin volatility against it. Right now you are investing in a growing technology if you buy Bitcoin and participate to what is equivalent to an early alpha testing.

You are all wrong. People are just opinionating without looking at the data. Are you able to plot a graph? Go and grab number of wallets versus price. Wonderful perfect correlation. The point is that Bitcoin at the moment is above the correlation trend because sometime the price goes over the trend line by quite a bit and then it stays stable for weeks or even months to jump again. But if you look the overall trend the correlation between number of users and price is there. More merchants, more users, higher price.

Sure any model needs to make some assumptions. The fact is though that these models are really useful in predicting population growth. It works for many natural and artificial systems. Please look at the TED talk i have linked above. 
It is a prediction but at the same time it is a model fitting of current data. So far the model has held very well. That is interesting per se given that theorists have made theoretical arguments of the value of a network. 
My conclusion is that so far Bitcoin has outperformed Zipf's law but not quite done as Metcalfe's law would have suggested. This to me is reassuring because Metcalfe law is pretty idealistic and not really valid for realistic social networks. 
It is nice also to see that it outperformed Zipf's law that is much more somber. 
What is important though that the growth pattern is pretty predictable, at least so far. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 16:12:41
Which vertical rise? People do not understand this point at all. The vertical rise is an illusion of seeing a regression curve in a linear plot. When you plot a regression curve in a log graph the vertical rise is not there. You realize then that the "rise" is pretty constant and it was happening all the time. This is why it is easy to predict the price of Bitcoin in 2014. Bitcoin will continue its pretty constant rise in an exponential fashion. Plot Bitcoin price in a log graph and see how predictable and constant it is over its history. There are very fundamental reasons for this constant growth and it has to do with the physics of networks. Eventually Bitcoin price will reach a plateau but even that is pretty predictable (at least with some minimal assumptions). It should happen in about 3.5 years from now, when Bitcoins will reach a price of 1 million USD.

Just realized that using market cap to establish a value for Bitcoin is absurd. It makes no sense at all. If everybody that has anything of value would go to the banks to retrieve their saving or put for sale what they have of value (house, land, gold, bonds, etc.) there would not be money in the world to redeem these items. The same applies to BTC, you cannot say the value of BTC would be so if the market cap would be 1 trillion and then divide for the number of BTC. It makes no sense. The value can be much higher than this.

You the same opportunities now that you had then. Bitcoin will continue to grow exponentially for at least the same time period it has been traded so far (3.5 years). By then it will be worth 1 million dollars. This is not wishful thinking. It is a serious prediction. Unless something catastrophic happens to BTC it will be worth anything from 100 to 1000 times more in few years.

Yes, Bitcoin will be worth 1 million dollars in 2017 if it continues its exponential growth that exhibited in the last 3.5 years. 
There is no reason why this exponential growth will stop or slow down for the next few years. The price of BTC is about 70 percent what it should be according its trend line. If you extrapolate this conservative trend line you get 1 million dollars by mid 2017.

I did similar graphs and found out really the price depends on the number of new wallets. It is a strong correlation. The price depends on the 1.7 power of the number of users. When the number of users grows by 130 times the price will rise by a factor of 1000. Given the pretty stable growth we see since 2009 (that follows a logistic model or adoption curve) the price of BTC should be 1 million dollars by 2018 (much more realistic prediction). 
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:12:38
The point is that a network doesn't know consciously about these things. There is nobody planning the growth rate or deciding the value of the network. It is like what happens with ants, each ant is not clever enough to understand what is going on at the super-organism level but the collective intelligence of the colony can do amazing things. It is the interaction between many agents that create these regularities. I asked you only one thing: look at the data. I just talk about the data. You can take the first 1.5 years of BTC and project to predict the next 1.5. If you did that in 2011 you could have predicted the price now. The prediction is about 600 dollars for BTC that is slightly less that the price now. The correlation I found is not between the future number of users but the current number of users. The system doesn't know anything about the future number of users but it reacts continuously to the present number of agents in the system. There are some feedback loops of course (for example more users in the system more users are joining in) but this is already included in the model (it explains the exponential growth). Please do not use your intuition, start from the video I linked and research the topic. Here a more detailed version of the above talk:

Here what I have commented sometime ago about networks laws and Bitcoin: 
@_date: 2014-01-18 19:23:19
Again, absurd and meaningless. Why the people lost money? Because they sold in panic. Yes, Bitcoin will continue to do what has done for a while (growing in time scales of more than a month) because of very fundamental reasons like being a new technology that is being adopted by more and more people. Of course sometime in the future the exponential growth will taper in a slow up or constant value but this is several years away from now. I don't care what a definition of crash is in a normal financial situation. Bitcoin is not crashing when it has grown exponentially since it has been traded. I'm sorry, maybe it is something that people do not understand easily 50 % changes in value compared to exponential growth (where order of magnitude are relevant) are basically equal to nothing. It is called an order of magnitude estimate. I have shown different time scales to demonstrate this growth is not a fluke but time scale invariant that is another property of system like Bitcon, a network. A network value grows with the square of the nodes in the system (the users here). If have demonstrated elsewhere in Reddit that the growth of Bitcoin price is proportional to the power of 1.7 (almost 2) the number of transactions (that is a good proxy for the number of users, nodes in the network). This is probably more profound that most people understand but this why they will miss the opportunity that Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 15:10:14
It is NOT misleading. Go back to school. When you have a phenomenon that has covered many orders of magnitude this is how you represent it. !!!! Common people why don't you get it? I have done science professionally for 20 years now. This is what we do all the time in physics, astronomy and economics. If you have several orders of magnitude you use a log graph (or a log log graph) to look for patterns !!!! I see this incredible resistance in people understanding things that are not linear. Look at the idea of power law on Google. Look at the work of Geoffrey West that has studied non linear growth in biological systems, cities and corporations. Please do not talk about stuff you don't understand. That is misleading. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:53:59
I can assure it is. I have done science professionally since 25 years. You can increase the complexity of your model but as you do that you can introduce even more assumptions. 
Models are not an exact picture of reality but a good approximation. There are tools to show if your model is a good fit to the underlying data and when I applied this tool the answer is that the fit is pretty good. The only way to tell if the model is useful is to wait and get even more data. You improve your model as you acquire more information.

In this graph I have used a logistic model to predict the number of wallets downloaded. Then using the empirical relationship between wallets and price I extrapolate the price value according to a pure power law estimation. Using the last year values you get actually a power law of 1.45 (and not 2 or 1.7 that you can derive from 3 years Mt.Gox data). Bottom line is that Bitcoin is doing better than Zipf's law but worse than Metcalfe. Still it is pretty amazing that it does follow closely a power law indicating that some deep interesting network physics is going on. 
What is also interesting that BTC is the first direct test of value of a network given the strict relationship between number of nodes (users) and the monetary value of the network in dollars.

It is faulty thinking. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:30:21
Why do you have to use market cap? Do you think that if everybody with anything of value (land, houses, gold,..) would go to the bank to redeem it there would be enough cash on earth to cover these assets? Not, at all. Market cap is not what to use here to assign value to BTC. It is not a correct approach.

Network theory takes into account these distributions of usage. It turns out that in general 80 percent of activity in a network is done by about 20 % of users. It is a rule of thumb but works pretty well in most cases. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 07:01:03
I studied the price of Bitcoin carefully. The value of the network grows with a power law that is in between Metcalfe law and Zipf's law. 
The power law for bitcoin is that the network value goes with the power of 1.7 the number of users. 
It is not as good as Metcalfe'law but close.

There are 10,000 people getting Coinbase accounts every day. There are about 9000 blockchain accounts created every day and 8500 downloads of the basic wallet every day. So about 30 K users every day join the network. Every single day, and these numbers are growing exponentially. The same with merchants, investors, start ups.

Better to fit a logistic model though. And the good. But you can do better. There is a relationship between the growth of the wallets and price, it is a power law that is predicted from network theory. The empirical data fits the prediction. The ups and downs are just noise (try to do an histogram of it and see how predictable at all scales it is). The large events are coming up about one each 9 months (the "bubble"). People should learn math instead of finance.

Here a very nice article on adoption in different countries. Your assertion is not supported by data. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:07:29
In which way? What is difficult to understand? Here broken down to you so you can finally understand (I hope):
I explained clearly what I have done. 
1) Used the empirical data of unique addresses as a function of time.
2) Fitted a logistic model to the data in 1) with only one free variable (number of final users)
3) Fitted with a linear regression model the data points in a log-log graph with price in the y axis and users in the x axis. Derived a power law with a power if 1.45 by measuring the slope. 
4) Used this power law and the logistic model to predict the price. 
5) Calculated how well the model fits the empirical trend of price vs time and obtained a highly statistical significant value. 
6) Plotted as a comparison what one would obtain using Metcalfe's or Zipf's law. They don't fit very well at all. 
So is it clear now? 
I have a PhD in Physics.

It is rambling to you because you don't understand the math. What is wrong in what I said? The Metcalfe law chart is not showing clearly anything. It is just a suggestion that there is a similar trend between price and transactions or number of users.
 It doesn't show what is this relationship and it doesn't show the law underlying the number of users. Any power law close to 2 would work in that graph. What I have shown instead is that the true power law is not Metcalfe but something in between Metcalfe's and Zipf's. Notice if Metcalfe's would be really true we would have Bitcoin worth billion of dollars in few years, quite unrealistic. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:39:29
About the issue of correlation vs causation in general you are right. Correlation doesn't imply causation and for sure it could be there are feedback loops that is part of the network idea. 
As people see value in the network they decide to join in. 
But I did use Granger causality and it does show that the main causation direction is towards users increase -&gt; higher price and weakly in the other direction (so there is a loop but it is driven mostly by more users joining in).

Yes, I can that is the point. Look at the Metcalfe's law and the more realistic Zipf's law. 
Actually Bitcoin is something in between the optimal case (and not realistic case) of the Metcalfe's law and the too pessimistic and conservative Zipf's law. What is funny is that I studied the data, but many people seem to talk about what Bitcoin is doing or will do without even looking at the data or having the tools to analyze them. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 07:35:29
Here is really what is going on. It is an adoption curve and if plotted properly (in a log graph) you see a clearly, unique pattern. The times when it stays stable or goes up and down by a factor of 2 are just noise on the overall trend. Also BTC will continue to grow following this same exponential growth until it reaches a saturation point several years from now. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:57:12
It is a good introduction to the topic but the video's author doesn't really use real data just makes guesses and explains the general topic in simplistic ways.  I like it but it is not correct technically. For example he doesn't realize that the price is not a linear relationship with the number of users. It follows a power law. Also there is no real vertical growth, that happens really all the time as the price grows. It is a kind of optical illusion of plotting an exponential process on a linear graph. At a point the changes are so big that they look like a sudden jump in comparison with previous changes but the rate is basically the same until you reach saturation when you get basically a constant value (it is never reached really just coasting towards it).

It is one of the best investment ever. I would not say this if I was not super-confident. I have posted here several times about the growth of Bitcoin and how it is a very predictable pattern. It will continue to grow with predictable rates for several years until a single Bitcoin will be woth 1 million dollars or close to that. It is very safe investment. Just hold if price drops even by 50 % (that will not happen again very likely). It will recover again within few weeks if that happens and as it has done over and over again. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:30:12
Besides the sun goes up every day, there are few predictable patterns in life. There are systems that follow precise power laws that have to do with the nature of the phenomenon. Bitcoin is such a phenomenon. That is what is not understood. Regulations, pump and dumps, news are almost non a factor. They can momentarily jump the price up and down but BTC then goes back to its trend line or oscillates around it. In average we have been 14 % away from this trend line in both directions with occasional 70 or 80 percent discrepancies (rare events). But even factors of 2 are meaningless when you talk about exponential growth. The exponential growth is driven by one factor only, not millions. The rate of adoption. Period. In fact there is a strong correlation (R^2 = 0.82) between number of users and price. All these things are not understood by too many people, unfortunately. Also the price doesn't grow linearly with the number of users but instead with the power of 1.4 of the number of users. That is nice because for the price to increase 1000 times you need only 140 times the number of users of today. We have about 2 million BTC users. So 300 million people using BTC is very reasonable. That would bring the price up to 1 million dollars. These are not numbers I made up but I have spent hours studying the data and I have extracted the information from 3.5 years of BTC history. There is no reason why this predictable growth, that has been very smooth and not affected by news or other irrelevant factors, would not continue until saturation that is very far from now. Look up Geoffrey West, a physicist that has worked on growth patterns of organisms, cities and corporations to understand what I'm talking about:

This type of analysis is meaningless. You need to use tools scientists use like a log graph to see what is the underlying pattern. It an exponential growth with a stochastic process noise superimposed on it. The big fluctuations have the same nature that the small ones, they are rarer but larger, they obey the same statistical pattern and distribution of the smaller fluctuations.

In this graph I have used a logistic model to predict the number of wallets downloaded. Then using the empirical relationship between wallets and price I extrapolate the price value according to a pure power law estimation. Using the last year values you get actually a power law of 1.45 (and not 2 or 1.7 that you can derive from 3 years Mt.Gox data). Bottom line is that Bitcoin is doing better than Zipf's law but worse than Metcalfe. Still it is pretty amazing that it does follow closely a power law indicating that some deep interesting network physics is going on. What is also interesting that BTC is the first direct test of value of a network given the strict relationship between number of nodes (users) and the monetary value of the network in dollars
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:40:16
I have already discussed on r/bitcoin that the real empirical law is not N^2 but N^1.7 for Bitcoin, close to the Metcalfe law but not quite. Superimposing the graph in this way in a log chart doesn't reveal the correct law. It makes a huge difference if we are dealing with a power of 2 or 1.7.
The power of 1.7 is still pretty amazing but not as 2 but much more realistic.

The guy said he could not talk about it but all what he meant that he could not talk about the stuff he did when he worked on government projects. He said he was misinterpreted. It makes complete sense. 
Dorian background is just vaguely technical. To be the Bitcoin Nakamoto you need a very specific set of skills that even people that have PhD in the field do not possess. This is why many real clever people that looked into this believe Nakamoto is a group of people instead of a single person.
It is clear from the post and videos of Dorian that he is mildly senile and he has not the cognitive abilities that are necessary to solve a problem that was considered unsolvable in the hard field of cryptography. 
The Bitcoin Nakamoto (if one person) has an amazing mastery of the English language and very high verbal skills while Dorian talks in simple English full of grammar mistakes and nonsensical sentences.

Well, what matters in my model is the final number of adopters. I used a total of 1 billion people (about 10 % of the total world population). It is a pretty conservative number. Then you apply a logistic model (the S shaped adoption curve that has worked for many other technologies) and fit it to the number of unique addresses (the blue curve on the top of the graph I have shown). 
You use then the growth pattern and the empirical relationship between the price and number of unique addresses to predict the price. As you see is a pretty good fit (very statistically significant). 
And what is interesting that it comes close to the theoretical prediction. If nothing else Bitcoin is a very interesting experiment in network dynamics. It is the first time we can actually compare directly the expected value of a network with its real market value.

The bumps you see, up and down are meaningless in terms of the overall exponential curve. I have repeated this dozen of times now. There is just one pattern. Bitcoin is growing exponentially since it has been traded. You have just to look at time scales comparable with the tau (at least few months).

Bitcoin is not a bubble. It has grown exponential over its entire public life of 3.5 years. Even a change in price of a factor of two is absolutely nothing on a scale of few months when you deal with an exponential trend.

I created this graph using the projected growth of Bitcoin based on the observed exponential growth over the last 3.5 years.
It is the accumulated value of a Bitcoin account where an investor buys 100 dollars worth of Bitcoin every month (that is less and less Bitcoin per transaction every time because the value grows up relative to USD). Still over a period of time on the scale of the current history of Bitcoin (3.5 years) you could retire with $ 1 million in your account.

Yes, x3
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:29:19
3. is not correct. 
Only financial institutions cannot deal with bitcoin not businesses in general. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:00:42
But that is my point. Regulation is not affecting the general trend (China tried and it is looks like a small bump when you plot it on a log chart), hacking is not affecting the underlying trend (it happened before and it did just cause small bumps on the overall trend). As I said the general trend is a fundamental phenomenon and therefore pretty strong and predictable. Of course it would not last for ever, it will assume a S shape, but for the next 3-5 years there is absolutely no reason why the trend would not continue. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:36:41
It is a MatLab plot first of all. And yes, it is a simple regression model, that is a standard in science. Your point? 
But understanding the data and what it tells requires some thinking. What these data tell you?
To me the data are saying something simple, that bitcoin will continue to do what has done for several years to come. I cannot see any particular event changing this overall direction. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:09:22
Do you have some link about the problem with the transaction rate? I was not aware of it. Hopefully they can fix it, so far the developers at the Foundation have solved all the challenges and problems. I expect them to do the same in the near future. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:24:23
You are thinking about a mathematical abstraction, real data are just approximated by mathematical functions. What I have said is that right now the trend is exponential, eventually the trend could flatten and assume a S shape. There are phase transitions in real life power law like phenomena. But you can see the overall trend is pretty predictable. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:00:20
This is a much better fit. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:33:47
Here the underlying exponential growth based on the historical data of Bitcoin. There is no reason why such growth would not continue because it is based on fundamental principle as the speed of adoption of new technology (very universal pattern). 
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:53:12
Ok, thank you I will try that. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:37:02
I don't think you get it. This trend is not like any other trend in the financial world. It is more like a socio-techno-physics law. Very similar to Moore's law or other exponential growth phenomena involving digital information. They are very universal trends.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:04:03
People that say absurd things about bitcoin going down haven't seen the historical chart of bitcoin. It is an exponential curve over 3.5 years (since bitcoin has been traded publicly). It will be 100 K in 2016. It is a mathematical prediction. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:04:53
Right, my estimate is pretty conservative. I used a lower bond for the historical exponential growth. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:03:07
Notice that according to this graph (very conservative) Bitcoin will reach a price of 1000 in the middle of 2014. That is a fundamental price, in other words even if the price could oscillate up and down, by that time it would stabilize at 1000. Also notice that the predicted price of the model for now is about 500 $ (that is what it seems to be at after the Chinese exodus). 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:26:57
Forget about the powers. This is what bitcoin is all about. The powers are useless. They can ban bitcoin, they can punish people for using it but in the end they cannot stop it. It is the same thing that happened with the internet. The internet is bigger than any government. Bitcoin is the internet of money, it is unstoppable. It is not an exaggeration. Do you realize that bitcoin is only 4 years old (less in terms of when it was publicly traded). This is just the beginning of the revolution.

My fit gave me more like 0.27 % per day.

Here the exponential historical data graph in Imgur:
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:06:01
See this chart using the log scale. Do you see a pattern? The bump up and down due to the China affair is insignificant on the overall trend. Think. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:03:59
565 dollars = dead. LOL. LOL 
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:08:09
Smart people have made prediction of 1 million. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:52:28
Please give some. Bitcoin has gone through some much and if you look at the exponential growth, these events are just small bumps, basically noise, over the strong long term signal. The signal is very typical of what you get when you have a new disruptive technology. A very universal pattern. There is interesting math behind, like how nodes in a information network spread. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:10:51
Not sure which part of this graph you don't get it, I guess all of it. Even a factor of 2 is nothing when you are dealing with an exponential curve. Probably people do not understand exponential trends, too fixated with their linear way of thinking. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:58:05
Horrible fit. You need to show this on an exponential graph and then fit it. The exponential pattern is pretty obvious. Just try. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:42:15
Even it it was possible, it would be the stupid small move ever because it will make the value of Bitcoin crash to zero. Unless this entity would want to destroy bitcoin on purpose it would be meaningless to do such an attack. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:04:54
For now it is, and it would be for a long time. Until at least the last coin is mined (decades from now).

Imagine I told you in the 90 you could own a piece of this thing called internet. Imagine it is a finite resource. Everything that it is done now on the internet would need your chunk of internet ownership to be done. Would not that valuable once the internet becomes essential to do almost anything of value in the modern digital world? When bitcoin would be widely adopted people would need to pay you quite a bit to have that resource available to do trade and commerce. With owing bitcoin you own a piece of the future financial global network. Very valuable resource.
