You seem to believe the points you mentioned somehow exonerate him from being a moron... they don't, not even remotely. He's an idiot, all you have to do is listen to him talk to figure it out.

I'm questioning your claim it's discrimination... what is he being discriminated against for?


Personally I'd classify what's happening to him as censorship, and I'm fine with it.
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:42:48
So what are they discriminating against? Stupidity?

Jumped straight to the comments after seeing what was in the thumbnail to find out how bad OP fucked up... good one OP, got me.

Moved the rest of my btc and ltc from coinbase into my trezor, hour later get a notification about the drop. I sold 1/2 of my investment at $10.5k, now I really want to log back in and buy again. Fucking shit is already rebounding, I'm so pissed coinbase is down.

Apartment buildings and storage units.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:55:18
Eh, you said you'd work part time, so why not just let that be managing the apartments. One building would bring you in a guaranteed $6k/month even in a lower cost of living area... you going to get that from CDs? And storage units are even less maintenance... around here you see a guy build a storage unit, then the next year he puts up another building, then the next year he puts up another building. There's a reason for that.
If I get to $250k that's what I'm investing it into.

What exchange do you use? I only have a coinbase account right now.

The average income in my area is $53,000/year so no one is paying off a house in 3 years. Lower cost of living comes with lower wages. 
If you really are patient and wait for a deal, you can get a 1,000 square foot place with a garage for $395/month, which is what I have right now. The higher end is more like $1200/month for brand new buildings or entire houses. If you don't plan on living here forever, because winters do fucking suck, it's not a bad idea to rent. I rent because I absolutely hate the winters, and always planned on moving; I'm planning on moving to Utah next year. If I invest in property, it'll be back in Wisconsin though... great returns.

He's a piece of shit for selectively releasing information.
@_date: 2019-04-13 03:07:18


No, he's a piece of shit that selectively released information for his own agendas... if he truly sought justice, he would have released all the information. Maybe you are the one "too accepting" for believing this man is some kind of martyr, try thinking a little more critically.

If you have a lot on it, I'd do the following.
1. Take picture of written seed with a camera not connected wirelessly in any way.
2. Boot up your computer *without* an active internet connection with a distro like TAILS.
3. Encrypt the picture with Veracrypt, then copy it to two entirely new sdcards, then securely (overwrite) delete the contents of the original sdcard that was used by the camera.
4. Put one sdcard in a fireproof safe at home, put the other in a safety deposit box at your bank.
5. Don't forget your fucking password you used to encrypt it.
If you're going to have a paper copy of your seed, I'd changed one or two words, then store it the same way aforementioned. I would keep the changed word(s) in either my memory or on another medium on my body at all times, either in my wallet or usb drive. It wouldn't hurt to do both of these for redundancy.
I just don't like the idea of storing the entirety of it in clear text on paper or digitally, or having it on anything with an active internet connection. I know my seed is safe and secure by doing this, I absolutely no worries about it.
