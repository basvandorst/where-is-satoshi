So you're saying that a whale wanted to sell bitcoin \*and\* manipulate the price downwards while doing so?  Not sure I follow.

You last week: "Would BTC please drop below 10k so I can buy again?"
You today: "RIP BTC"
 today: "I told you so."

I would bet the major players are all working on a BTC integration as well as pursuing their "own" crypto solution.
Thanks for the interactive chart link... I've been looking for something like that, and it helps visualize the balance of power so to speak of the crypto landscape.
What is your take on the current comparative changes of BTC, ETH, LTC?  I ask about those three in particular because they're the only 3 available on Coinbase. With a massive influx of US investors via Coinbase since Thanksgiving (seems obvious) these 3 are being focused on by many who have limited access to the rest of the alt coin spectrum.  While ETH charts are showing variation, they seem to be nearly 100% pegged to the BTC/USD charts. However, LTC has seen a massive increase independent of BTC, peaking a few minutes ago above $225, and now falling a bit but still in the $215 range. Why?

Does a market for BCH even exist now?  Serious question.  I started poking around looking for a way to buy or trade into some BCH (not a lot, easy on the "why?"s).  I couldn't find a decent option to acquire BCH.  Even Ver's site has a "buy bitcoin now" and it's for BTC not BCH, which surprised me, but maybe that's how he decided to offload some of his massive BTC holdings?  (It's a *high* fee cc-&gt;BTC provider.)
When I tried to find exchanges that supported BCH and were available to a US resident, I couldn't find anything that didn't scare me. Poloniex seems like an option, and then I found horrible stories of people loosing funds and support tickets that took weeks to resolve. And that's not just a matter of the last few days of high volume, this has been going on for a while it seems. So is there a suitable source for BCH in the US?
I guess based on the OP, maybe I should be patient, wait for Coinable to release the forked coins and then the market will perhaps dip hard.

Yes... paper fiat currency is SOOOO much safer.
That's it, I'm cashing out and moving to Poland.

Please sticky this post. Seriously. I was actually trying to buy Bitcoin Cash Bcash whatever today and had difficulty doing so. Even Ver's own site (bitcoin dot com) only offers BTC, not BCash. After watching this, I fully understand what's at stake and sincerely hope Bitcoin Cash will not succeed with a sociopath at the helm. And if it does, I don't want any part in it.
There is no way to defend the Bitcoin "brand" other than to just allow the forks to further dilute their pool as "Bitcoin-whatever". I predict we will see dozens of Bitcoin-somethings over the next few months and hopefully BCash will disappear into the background noise.
