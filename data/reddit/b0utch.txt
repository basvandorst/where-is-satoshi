I have no idea who these moron are, it's very unlikely that it will go up 10x anytime soon but someday when the average citizen start using it, it will.  Bitcoin are meant to replace the banking system, in order to get rid of the "too big to fail banks" who are ruining the economy like a fucking bunch of bloodsuckers.  Will some people get rich in the process?  Yes and we hope they are there to change to world, not just to become a fatcat. I can why, I can't say how, I'm not a dev or a programmer.  If it fail?  Well, failing is the first step to success.

Oh no, bitcoin mining might become more decentralized...  and the offer will be reduced a little.... so  great success?
@_date: 2016-04-06 18:14:00
You haven't grasped the concept yet, study harder.
@_date: 2016-04-18 15:09:54
Stable, not stagnant.
@_date: 2016-04-20 20:01:25
You are brave.
@_date: 2016-04-06 18:15:50
I have no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:36:49
I never trust people who say never, Hell I can't even trust myself.
@_date: 2016-04-06 18:10:51
Very few people bought bitcoin to get rich quickly...  I bought bitcoin because banks are inefficient and they must dissappear and they will.

Currency of the future minus the stupid people of today.
@_date: 2015-06-12 06:33:10
And how corpulent are you? I never subbed to that sub but I do hate fat people for what they represent and the bad example they represent.

Blaming the government for the wrong doing of the people leading it, which is biased political ideologists elected by the under educated voters, seems to be a mistake to me, beside that I have no problem with what he is saying and I didn't watch it all.   Minus the fluoride miracle bottle ads.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:33:43
Get on the cryptoboat and be left behind.
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:41:20
Cypher what? We couldn't care less about your ideology, honestly, you need to grow the fuck up. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:44:08
Doing what's right makes you a leader,  we used to do the right thing before the conservative ruined everything.
@_date: 2016-01-27 15:35:11
low level manipulation attempt, these people are the worst kind of the worst...
@_date: 2016-03-19 13:56:31
On what charges? This is ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-03-13 22:48:18
That's not what the graphic says.
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:12:28
He quit?  He failed.
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:16:29
Wait for the dump.
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:23:52
 ?
@_date: 2016-01-27 15:31:42
I'm staying away from this shit.
@_date: 2016-06-08 01:11:55
Miss Lepen doesn't understand shit about crypto currencies: "Ultimately, this is a hostage of citizens by private banks and by monitoring all transactions. On behalf of the digital progress and the fight against terrorism, to remove cash in favor of virtual currencies is a man's alienation in favor of the global banking system."
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:01:07
Why do you feel the need to influence others?
@_date: 2015-08-14 19:44:17
Move to voat.co to begin with... And don't argue. Reddit isn't neutral enough anymore.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:58:43
Are you serious?  That's disgusting.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:29:07
That's a lot of upvote...
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:28:17
What attack? Criticism is an attack?  Lel
@_date: 2015-07-25 17:16:04
So your parents are dead? I suppose...  
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:06:51
Elaborate? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:00:56
Who ever ban posts do not understand the idea behind the upvoting,downvoting system and should kill themself right away. The only stuff they should ban is spamming or off topic post,  everything else is none of their business and they have no right to decide for us.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:37:23
We on low orbit.
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:37:57
Yes, I am ignorant, and any human who says otherwise is an idiot.
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:48:43
Ideology?  Belief?  What are the facts? Let have a rational decision and you get lost with your beliefs.
A is the only logical choice. Bitcoin were created to destroy the banks that have too much influence over our politicians, not side with them.    Correct me if I understood this wrongly.  
@_date: 2016-02-18 18:17:45
You don't make much sense.
@_date: 2016-02-18 18:21:35
These people are going to be murdered hopefully, if they ever get caught and I'll be completely fine with this.
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:52:05
Totally right, I ain't even mad.
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:32:25
Not understanding the innovating factor, you missed your chance...
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:35:24
Saying you are a libertarian is as good as saying you are retarded...
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:34:21
Did you read the white paper? Most likely not. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:59:00
To understand the innovating factor?  If you can.
@_date: 2015-04-30 21:06:36
Can't stop natural selection from happening, life is cruel, deal with it.
@_date: 2015-04-14 16:58:15
@_date: 2015-11-12 14:32:11
Because you say so?
@_date: 2015-10-27 05:51:25
Still building the launching ramp.

Leave facebook for tsu.co instead, they give you back a large % of the profit from ads.
@_date: 2016-05-18 19:36:31
Not again.
