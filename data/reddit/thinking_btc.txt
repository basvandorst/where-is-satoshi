No. This isn't Wolf of Wallstreet or The Big Short. It is absurd that so many have to come up with some dramatic narrative to explain every bit of price action. There is not as much institutional money as you might think right now. While there are large players capable of moving the price (and do just that), that's not what's going on here. Buyers likely don't find this price low enough, and sellers are probably not sure if we're about to have another bull run. Breakouts don't happen until price approaches (and breaks) previous levels of resistance or support, and we're right in between right now, so not much volume.

Happens all the time, and in larger quantities

No they didn't, just regulating out of code mining operators, essentially. "China just banned Bitcoin mining"? Please, tell me where it says that. You're just being a sensationalist for your own excitement

See how it goes? Kraken's system upgrade is irrelevant now. That much downtime for an exchange is unacceptable and cost many lots of money. The way they handled the upgrade and the fact that it took them so long proves that Kraken is incompetent and unreliable. Absolutely NO ONE should have any open positions with Kraken. Extremely risky.

Ya which is about 50-75mm, and *each* of the top 5 coin exchanges by volume trade *10x* that volume *daily*

Did you use US bank account or somewhere else?

Oh that's good to know, thanks. Do you know if there is a limit to how much they'll credit instantly?

Thank you

Okay I might have to try that. I thought I had read that it was taking some people 10+ days for bank wire on there, at least within the last week. I made a bank wire there 2 weeks ago and it only took 48 hours.
