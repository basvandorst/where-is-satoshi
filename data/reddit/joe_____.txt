Haha, there's a very real possibility I was being overly sensitive. &lt;3 no hard feelings on my end if there are none of yours!

I'll make a point to start adding a note when I post about the company.

You realize that Moolah  like 3 months old right? Even if they are releasing a v2 they are still brand new.
Well, first of all there's a thing called the burden if proof. This would fall in you since you are asserting that things are not as they appear. But I'll ignore that for now.  He's met with several people, he has an actual corporation that is registered in several countries, he's skyped more than a few people. There's no doubt that he's a real person. The fact that the business is incorporated proves that. I don't understand how it was a fake 20M doge tip, he had the doge, and he gave it to the fundraiser. I'm a bit confused on how he destroyed the dogecoin foundation as well. From my perspective it looked like there were a handful of people who played around on Google and decided the way he issued the PIE wasn't legal so they grabbed their pitchforks and started libeling him and his company. He's posted a few times that there are several exemptions that they fall under, but the damage had already been done. There were people and even a mod who were breaking site wide rules and several laws with their posts and everything got hot so the other mods put an end to it 
If you don't like him for personal reasons I can't fault you for that. Hell, if you think he's not trustworthy and you elect to never use his products that's fine too! I have no issues with that. But the fast that he has so many people who did invest into their company and that we, as investors are pretty happy with it should say something.

Please do a bit of research about Moolah.io before forming your opinions. I've not had any bad experiences. They're a brand new company and there have been a few delays on things. The vast majority of the people I've known that have tried out prelude have been happy with it. Its a bit small on the volume side, but once again its a brand new company.
You don't have to like them, but please realize there are the majority of people who use prelude and other Moolah.io services are pretty happy with it.

I have zero issues telling people I've made a small investment into Moolah.io. My investing with them should lend more weight to my testimony. I was happy enough with their service to trust them with more of my money. But, even if that weren't the case, my investing with them doesn't negate the fact that I  also a customer of theirs. And a happy one at that.

Probably only in situations where the title is literally defaming a company and the poster is only guessing.

What kind of poster am I? Am I a non-existant account? Or one that only has 10 posts or so? Or am I one of the ones that's been inactive for the past couple of years? 
I've had nothing but pleasant experiences using Prelude, and I think has done more than enough to show he's not a scam. Sure, some of his stuff is a bit clanky at times but its a brand new business. I can't fault a guy for not having everything perfect when a new business launches.

No problems :)
