Just got those 0.10 BTC, whoa.
@_date: 2012-08-13 12:59:28
Looks like they are non-transferrable. I sent them out at the moment I got them but
the transaction is still pending. Well played, coinbase!

    &lt;riX2000&gt; that bullshit right
    &lt;riX2000&gt; ?
    &lt;pirateat40&gt; zeek?
    &lt;badbitcoin&gt; zeekfund
    &lt;pirateat40&gt; Is that a new startup?
    &lt;badbitcoin&gt; zeekrewards*
    &lt;pirateat40&gt; ???
    &lt;badbitcoin&gt; no, its a ponzi
    &lt;badbitcoin&gt; that folded just around the time that you closed up shop
    &lt;pirateat40&gt; um
    &lt;badbitcoin&gt; affilated with your investments, y/n?
    &lt;badbitcoin&gt; 
    &lt;pirateat40&gt; badbitcoin, i had no idea it was going on and no nothing to do with me.
    &lt;badbitcoin&gt; ok.
    &lt;badbitcoin&gt; there was speculation you yourself were acting as a passthrou into zeek.

That's just not true, there's a ฿ (&amp;

I got nothing on signup. "Get 0.10 BTC and Give 0.10 BTC when you refer a friend"
Well, [here's]( my link then. Pay in upvotes.

Sorry pal, it wasn't gmaxwell.
@_date: 2011-06-18 20:22:49


Gosh. Just to clear things up - you don't have to "sign" anything that was transferred to your address. Just leave poor wallet alone! Leave it alone!
@_date: 2011-06-18 21:36:25
Define work? Your quote again:


You don't have to turn it on when "RECEIVING a transfer from your trading client". The network does all the job. There's absolutely no reason to "decrypt it temporarily" unless you're SENDING funds from it.

The pool continually expands so it's always 100 unused keys ahead.
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:12:47
Meh. I do just the contrary. Still stuck at 3 though, decoding huge lists of "lost treasures". It'd be great to get another hint for 3.
@_date: 2013-05-12 17:59:32
"The Riddle of the Sphinx" is not a very good password.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:06:43
Carbon wallet? LOL. Nope.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:20:27
Too much of it is not healthy, that's for sure.
@_date: 2013-05-13 04:58:34
Just figured out the hint for cryptobin 5 was skipped, that's why it was so confusing:
level 1:  The Riddle of the Sphinx (hint 1 - They had to answer this riddle to gain entrance)
level 2:  Hall of Records (hint 2 - They had to answer this riddle to gain entrance)
level 3:  The Fifth Element (hint 3 - You can count the treasures on 1 hand )
level 4:  Boron (hint 4 - Atomic number)
level 5:  Carbon (NO HINT!)
level 6:  Graphene (hint 5 - It's pure)
level 7:  Bacon (hint 6 - Too much is not healthy)
level 8:  Victory (hint 7 - Follow the capitals, hint 8 - There is more to the opposite)
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:38:55
Sorry! It's getting too easy, I'll stop for a while.
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:25:27
Oh, it's "The Fifth Element", great.
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:49:06
Phew! Seems it just got relayed despite the low priority, sorry.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:59:36
It's not done yet - the last transaction doesn't match fee rules (5kb and just 0.00002 fee) so it's likely won't be ever confirmed. Those 0.127 BTC are still available.
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:14:05
Too late.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:30:36
The only new thing that comes to mind is "A Boy and His Atom" where they moved carbon monoxide molecules but it won't work.
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:07:45
"Hall of Records" too.
