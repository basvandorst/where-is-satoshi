Thank you. Someone admits it. Those boys do well in their cause. I hope they can keep their head down long enough.

lol "anarchists". Getting interviewed in a public magazine. The best best part is they're trying to make something "untraceable" and you just made yourself a target, great work, really, quality. WIRED needs to go back to writing about the latest tech. Leave anarchy and destruction to the professional, please.

yes, simply yes. 
every 10 mins that goes by is another loss. there is a time limit to all this. Look at RIM and Blackberry when they didn't adapt to the market. too late to recover.

I see many contradictions here. Including your question. “Boiling” it down to semantics. Anarchy is a state of disorder, an absence of a government and an absolute freedom of the individual. To be an anarchist is to be a supporter/enactor of. Those boys do that on occasion, obviously. Not arguing that. But to create anarchy in a country that already lets you get away with a bunch of shit isn’t much of anarchy to me and the fact that WIRED is exercising their free speech to talk about it makes it even more to the contrary. Talk about it somewhere they don't allow it. I’m also wondering why they agreed to have a target painted on the back of their heads and let WIRED publicize something that, in the wake of silk road, is still deemed a unstable commodity. In this article, they are portrayed as comic book heroes. Maybe they are to some, but isn’t this all just a little too “MTV”? When i read this article I couldn’t tell if these guys were serious or in a movie coming out soon. I say, shut your trap and go back to work. We don’t need to know who you are. Stop putting yourself out there. The gov keeps information from us, lets keep SOME for ourselves. Using free speech to support anarchy or even just to document it is a little contrary to me. The word "anarchy" gets thrown around too much. Its not about who's saying it its about who's listening. Down vote all you want while i create anarchy on this post.
