Generate the keys using a Raspberry Pi, fair dice, or other entirely offline method.
Keep the keys in a Truecrypt file container.  Or if I'm especially paranoid, put the keys in a Truecrypt file container, then put that inside another Truecrypt file container, and maybe three or four levels more.  You may, if you wish, do this with both the hidden and outer partitions to implement a system of multiple passwords shared among multiple parties, so that a 3-of-5 or whatever could be used to access the keys.
Keep said containers on multiple hard drives in geographically separate locations, so that Yellowstone won't wipe them all out.

No, we absolutely don't, unless you want the same quality of service that the VA gives to veterans.


One of my uncles was almost one of them;  his VA physician refused to even look at his larynx for several months even as he was having trouble speaking.  If you guessed "laryngeal cancer", you're right!  He guessed it too, which was why he was going in and demanding to have her stick a scope down his throat, but she kept putting him off and refusing even to look.  Why?  Because that costs the government money, and she wanted to save budget, and she had no incentive to bother.
Welcome to government-run healthcare.  It's the same shit that happens in glorious Canada and perfect Britain, but the media never quite bothers to mention that little detail.
Sort of like, you know, Venezuela being a great example of socialism, with Bernie saying how wonderful it is, at least up until they ran out of things they could confiscate from people to keep the scam going.  Now all the little commies whine that "that's not Real Socialism!"  Well, yes it was and is.  And that's what happens every single fucking time.  Welcome to reality.

You would have to depreciate the hardware, most likely on a three-year schedule.  For the electricity, that would be treated as a business expense, although you'd have to separate it out from your household electricity usage if you were mining at home.  Either using previous years' bills and calculating the difference, or doing the math on what the mining rigs are supposed to use, would probably be acceptable, but check with a qualified tax specialist first.

Instead of writing the addresses down on paper, use a Raspberry Pi that you never, EVER connect to the internet after you start generating addresses on it.
Load up the Pi, connect to the internet, download Truecrypt, Firefox, and the BitAddress webpage onto the Pi's flash drive, test to be sure they're working, and then disconnect.
Now you can generate addresses whenever you want and leave them on the Pi.  Store the addresses in a Truecrypt file container for security.  Note, DON'T EVER save them temporarily on the flash drive outside of the TCFC, because someone with mad 1337 haxx0r skillz could maybe undelete them or something and steal your magic beans.

You know, if you spread it out between this year and next year, your tax consequences will be a lot lower.  Not to mention that if you keep the kids' funds in Bitcoin, although you do risk it falling, you also have the possibility for more gains.
Also keep in mind, you got this Bitcoin from mining, not from paying post-tax money into an investment.  That might or might not cause different tax treatment (earned income rather than capital gains).  You can probably overlook the fact that you didn't report the, umm, three dollars and eighty-five cents that they were worth back in 2010, but it's a hook the IRS could use against you if they decide to make some examples of people.

Be aware that "financial professionals" often manage money based on the commissions that they receive from the things that they are investing in.  Back during the dot.com boom there were a lot of people who got wiped out because they gave their money to a "financial professional" who then made a zillion trades in the space of a week, racking up enormous commissions and wiping out the money that was given to them in trust for investments.
Then there were a lot of lawsuits against the "financial professionals" for intentional mismanagement and breach of their fiduciary duties.  But such lawsuits rarely recover more than a small fraction of the initial balance.
And let's not forget the 2008 financial crisis, when the "investment professional" geniuses insisted on shoving retirees' money into high-yielding GM debt instruments just before GM declared bankruptcy, because "these bonds are paying great yields!"
Never, ever trust a "financial professional" to manage things for your benefit.  They will manage it for their own benefit.  You have to make sure that their benefit aligns with your benefit.  Otherwise you WILL get fucked.

@_date: 2017-12-10 16:46:26
You have to go back into the history of the whole mess to understand it.  Note, the below is my understanding of the history and rough timeline.  Any characterizations or statements of opinion are my own.
1. Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin (BTC) and got things rolling.
2. In around 2012, a couple of European guys came up with an optimization for the mining algorithm that reduced the amount of work necessary. The optimization was called ASICBOOST.  They sold the patent application to a company called Terra that was going to manufacture ASIC mining hardware.  The patent application published in 2013.
3. After the MtGox debacle, which caused a collapse in the price of BTC, Terra went bankrupt.  Interest in mining dropped and Terra had already burned its cash but wasn't far enough along to start selling.
4. The ASICBOOST patent application went abandoned as a result.
5. Jihan Wu was already in the mining rig business.  He saw the patent application publication, realized he could make a fucking fortune by using it, and secretly implemented ASICBOOST in his mining rigs -- he didn't turn it on in the ones he was selling to other people, just in his own private-use mining rigs.
6. The great scaling debate started, as Bitcoin's decentralized nature was too slow for replacing MasterCard/Visa.  The first thing people wanted was something called "segregated witness" (SegWit), which would allow for many further optimizations.
7. SegWit would break Jihan's secret ASICBOOST optimization.  He therefore began spreading FUD about it and stalling the implementation.  He convinced a whole bunch of complete shitheads to follow him.  Some were in it for the money or power, some are just idiots.
8. Someone else finally spotted the ASICBOOST patent application and realized that some odd things that were happening in Jihan's miners were related to it.  They disassembled the firmware and found the code.  They also found a "kill switch" that Jihan could use to shut off the mining rigs of people who didn't do what he wanted, although this didn't end up getting used by him, probably because people now knew who to blame.
9. This caused the user community to force the issue and demand a user-activated soft fork (UASF) for SegWit.
10. With his secret blown, Jihan got desperate and started doing all sorts of batshit insane things like demanding the doubling of block sizes (the so-called "New York Agreement" or "SegWit2" which only about a dozen mining companies "agreed" to), forking off his own "pure" coin that he named "Bitcoin Cash" (BCH) in an attempt to capitalize on the Bitcoin "brand", and engineering a financial attack on the Bitcoin price by dumping his BTC and pumping the cash into his BCH.  As an aside, the "SegWit2" thing failed hard when the code they released was so buggy that it failed before it even began its chain-split.  Also, the BCH implementation had been intentionally written to allow "replay" transactions to steal coins on the other chain when coins on a first chain were moved, which wasted a lot of time for BTC developers as they rushed to put together a fix so that that wouldn't work any more.
11. That brings us to today.
The upshot is that BCH is barely being used in the real world, with the only use that I have heard of being that Jihan is demanding people pay him in BCH for his mining rigs because he's trying to get people to use it.  It is going to dry up and blow away eventually.  He'll be happy for you to dump money into it if you want to, though.
Oh, and you can tell pretty easily who the "useful idiots" and shills are in this thread -- they're the ones who are telling you BCH isn't a scam.

The problem is, if you don't understand what someone means by "SSD over spinning media", you're clueless.
That said, I don't know why one would prefer an SSD to a hard drive in this situation.  In fact, I generally find hard drives preferable because they don't suffer from bitrot and they are far more recoverable after a disaster.  If an SSD glitches, the data is most likely completely unrecoverable.  Hard drives have built-in error correction systems that make undetectable errors rare, they're a lot cheaper, and you can make multiple copies to avoid that risk as well.

There are other models of upconverters, some larger.
And I've never lived anywhere that did not have 220V available -- the standard in the U.S. is to run a pair of 110V lines into residences.  You get 220V if you use both, 110V if you use a single line.  Normally half the house is hooked to each line, and there are a few outlets scattered around that connect to both for e.g. air conditioners, electric ovens, and clothes dryers.
During a windstorm a few decades ago, one of the two lines going into my home broke, and half the outlets in my house stopped working -- which is how I was easily able to deduce that it was time to call the power company to get the line from the power pole outside replaced. . . .

But seriously, "nationalization" is just the process from converting a PCT, which is merely a placeholder priority document, into an actual application that is being prosecuted and can result in an issued patent.  Prior to 2013, all patents were national in scope, which is part of why the term came about, and it's infuckingconvenient to make up a new term just because the (failing) EU made up a brand-new multinational "unitary patent" only since about 2013-ish.
See for example 35 USC 371.  It's just the terminology that has been around ever since the PCT came into existence. . . .

OP, your title is completely misleading.  The article says that one member of the village council ("a chairman of the Yelyzavetivka village council", a subunit of Dnipropetrovsk) has started "investing" council funds by trading cryptos (looks like random shitcoins), with the "intention" of distributing the funds to people some day.  It's Ukraine, so like that last will ever happen, LOL.  He also states that "social parasites" will not get crypto dividends, so basically anyone he doesn't like.
There's absolutely nothing about anyone in the village taking crypto for anything (other than these officials who are almost certainly going to steal it all for themselves).


Oh shit, [three guys one hammer]( :-(
And apparently it's been renamed to just "Dnipro" because the "-petrovsk" part was a Soviet-era appellation and they're de-Russifying things since the Putinvasion.

Just to shit up the thread a little more with a pointless anecdote, a few years ago I had to take an offsite/out-of-state training class, and rented a room from some stupid fuck via Craigslist.  He bitched me out one day for leaving the bathroom vent fan on for a few minutes after I took a shower, because electricity costs money.  A typical vent fan is about 25 watts.
He ran four big-ass computer servers 24x7x365 in his office, each with a 1000W power supply.  Two of them were used as web servers for his two shitty half-a-dozen-static-pages websites for his church and for some club he belonged to.  The other two were just up and running because he liked to have several computers up and running to play with whenever he wanted.
His bathroom wallpaper had mildew spots all over it because of his refusal to vent the place.  Oh well, not my house, not my mildew.  I was glad when the class was over.
Anyway, he's the spirit animal of the "Bitcoin uses too much energy!!!!!" tards.

It's basically a disinformation campaign.  When it came up a few months ago, someone did the math and found that Christmas tree lights used more energy.  But in the absence of anything to compare it to, the big number sounds scary.
The reality is that when you can turn electricity into money through some device, then there is an economic incentive to do just exactly that, and more devices will be used to do that until the earnings are offset by the expenses.  Whoever has the cheapest electricity will win.

The same place money comes from and goes to in the stock market -- it appears and vaporizes.
Look, when Company X announces record results "after the bell" and the stock gaps up 3% at the next open, was there ever any money involved in driving it up?  No, it's just what people say they now demand in order to sell.
When Company Y's stock gets halted prior to a major announcement, and it announces that it just got caught faking its financials for the last decade, and its stock instantly drops from $15 to $0.15 when it reopens, where does the money go?  It vaporizes.
If you can pull up historical numbers, take a look at the stock symbol "EYE" back in the late 1990s or early 2000s.  They got an adverse court ruling in the EU and their stock went from $70 to $50 from the close to the next open.
Look up the marketing company that ran the McDonald's big-prizes games.  They got caught handing out the winning tokens to personal friends of the family that ran the company.  Their stock went from $5 to pennies.
Look up any of the major tech companies when they announce great results after the daily close.

You need to understand the guy who is behind ZeroHedge.  He is a Russian immigrant to the U.S. who committed securities fraud and who lost his stockbroker license as a result.  He then started his own personal blog site -- which is all that ZH really is, despite his claim of 40+ staffers.  Mostly, he copies-and-pastes news articles and blog content from a few dozen sources, then writes brief filler snippets around those authors' comments.
On things like Bitcoin, he spews garbage on both sides of any issue, and then cites back to whichever side won out to show just how awesomely brainy he was in seeing the outcome way back when.  He's posted articles that were mocking Bitcoin and articles that laud it.  Whenever it's doing well, he links back to the laudatory ones.  Whenever it plunges, he links back to the ones calling it a giant Ponzi scam.
And other than that, he mostly spews Russian agitprop about how the American economy will implode at any second, and promotes fake news stories such as about how Putin definitely didn't send military personnel into Ukraine to seize Crimea, most assuredly had nothing to do with the shootdown of MH-17, and how Ukrainians are living joyous lives under peaceful Russian rule.
In the end, he's just a giant asshole who makes money off people dumb enough to view the ads on his website.  Get an adblocker and deny him the revenue.

BCash was an attempt by Jihan Wu (a founder of Bitmain, manufacturer of ASIC mining rigs) and his cronies to seize control of Bitcoin.  It was a last-ditch effort after he failed to prevent SegWit from being adopted.
Wu wanted to block SegWit because he had found a mining exploit (ASICBOOST) that allowed him to generate vast profits for himself as long as he kept it secret, but that exploit wouldn't work any longer if SegWit got implemented.  So, he ran a two-year FUD campaign to try to scare the community off from SegWit.  This caused significant harm to Bitcoin as a whole, because without SegWit, Bitcoin couldn't scale to meet real-world transaction processing needs.
When someone finally disassembled the mining rig firmware from Wu's mining rigs and figured out that there was a hidden exploit, the shit hit the fan, and the community finally understood why Wu and his troll army had been blocking SegWit.  SegWit got adopted through a UASF.  Wu then created BCash to try to destabilize Bitcoin.  A short time later, he tried to pull what his crowd termed "the flippening" to slash hashrate on Bitcoin and promote BCash as a functional alternative.
Wu may also have been behind some of the games with flooding the network with transactions -- for one, his pool was a frequent miner of "empty blocks", refusing to include transactions in blocks they mined and thus creating congestion -- driving up transaction fees to the point that several major sites that used to use Bitcoin gave up.  It's hard to sell $5 in Reddit Gold or $100 in electronics when Bitcoin transaction fees are $15 or $50 (peak).  All of that shit stopped right around when Lightning Network first became available.
Fortunately, he failed, and that's where we are now.  Jihan Wu severely damaged Bitcoin's reputation -- even now, you find people asking about high fees and long delays, even though those days are gone -- and set back adoption by at least a year.  His scams also allowed the current mess of shitcoins to arise, which has further damaged the reputation of cryptocurrencies as a whole because so many of them were scams, error-prone (e.g., Ethereum and the DAO reentrancy hack among other screwups), or simply useless.

There's no such thing as "bulls fighting back".  The intrinsic value of a sequence of bits is zero.  The only thing that gives Bitcoin value is that it can be used in commerce as a way to prove that value has been transmitted from one party to another.
Unless Bitcoin is used for real-world transactions, it is valueless.  Unless Bitcoin's use in real-world transactions increases, it will stagnate.  If Bitcoin does not get accepted for use in real-world transactions, it will die.
As Bitcoin's use in real-world transactions increases, it will grow in value.

The risks come from spending and returning change to the same address, or spending from the same address multiple times.  Supposedly it's no longer secure, although it's not clear that current (i.e., non-quantum) computers would be able to break the private key in any useful amount of time.
Receiving to an address multiple times only makes those multiple transactions associated, which may or may not matter to you.

The main difference is that Bitcoin has provided something that occupies that niche already, and is being used -- in some cases quite heavily, such as in remittances.
A second difference is that where Bitcoin grew organically, Ethereum is trying to cram its way in as a second option -- along with Dash, Litecoin, and several hundred other "hey we're cryptocurrencies too!" coins.  Last time I looked, there were over 300, and none of them are actually being used for anything other than premining scams (or, in the case of Dogecoin, "for the lulz").
A third is that some of the other altcoins have actually gained a little traction in real-world use, such as Litecoin and even Dogecoin.
A fourth is that Ethereum already has a track record of fucking up royally and then rolling back their "irreversible" blockchain because someone well-connected was the one who got fucked.
A friend of mine has been buying into the Dash scam.  Apparently the only thing Dash might be useful for at present is buying hardware to mine Dash, and even there they seem to prefer to sell hardware for evil wastepaper fiat currencies, go figure.
Why not Litecoin instead of Ethereum?  Why not Dash instead of Ethereum?  Why not Doge instead of Ethereum?  Why not Potcoin instead of Ethereum?

Hyperinflation probably won't.  Inflation is and will, and will continue to rob you of your savings.
The government lies about how much prices have increased, and they even tell you that they're lying -- they routinely change the "basket of goods" by which they calculate the CPI, because they assume (correctly) that people substitute lower quality goods when the good stuff gets too expensive for them.  So instead of steak, you're buying hamburger;  instead of organic apples, you're buying the shitty early-picked-ethylene-ripened red not-very-delicious ones;  your Wal-Mart burritos went from 12 for $2.98 to 8 for $3.98 and dropped in quality until they became practically inedible (I know this one for a fact, since I used to buy them regularly).  But "inflation" barely budged between 2% to 3% during that whole time, yay!
The real rate, calculated by independent economists such as ShadowStats, has consistently been found to be more like 6% to 8% per year.  Russia, China, and others have been cutting bilateral trade deals negotiated in other currencies.  And with the world grumbling about the weakening of the USD, if the rest of the planet gives up on USD as a peg for trade (especially in oil), it will be cut in half in purchasing power so fast that you'll actually bother noticing.

The IRS notice also calls it a "virtual currency".  The question this Ohio judge answered is whether it falls within the insurance policy's definition of and therefore limit for "money", not whether it is or isn't a "form of money".
I would note that the Shavers case was decided in 2013, long before the IRS issued its notice.  Also, the issue was whether he had defrauded investors of something that fell within the fraud statute as "money".  I'd have to look up the caselaw to see whether/how that statute had been interpreted before -- whether they'd decided it applied to any asset of value, or had been narrowly limited to a nationally-issued currency such as dollars/euros/rand.
Something that people often forget is that the law is flexible and is applied by humans.  Even if the IRS notice had come out before Shavers's case was tried, I would expect nothing different to have happened.  He ran a Ponzi scam, having people give him things that had value so that he could waste that value on partying.  (And holy shit, I did the math, the 764,000 Bitcoin that he took from them would be worth five BILLION dollars today if they'd just hodled it themselves.)
Judges tend not to like highly contrived arguments, despite what the popular mythos claims about people getting off on "technicalities".  Most "technicalities" are for things that the government did not intend to regulate but that some butthurt whiner or asshole bureaucrat thinks they should have, for example the "gun show loophole" -- federal law says that federally licensed gun dealers have to run background checks.  It wasn't a "loophole" that individuals selling off a few guns don't have to run background checks, the feds explicitly decided not to require that.  Similarly, KYC/AML doesn't apply to people buying vegetables at the farmer's market with Bitcoin;  it's not a "loophole" to sell alpaca socks without verifying that your customer got his Bitcoin legally.

What's the point of any software project?  Why does Microsoft Word add ridiculously narrow features that hardly anyone uses?
When Bitcoin made its splash, dozens of groups decided "we can do it too, and we'll add something to ours to make it 'add value' so people will adopt ours instead!"  Ethereum chose the concept of smart contracts and rushed out a system to handle it.
They made some very badly flawed design choices and that's why/how they ended up with the DAO hack.  Various people commented after that hack about why the language design was a bad fit for smart contracts -- that a functional programming language would have at least avoided the reentrancy problem that destroyed their big automated investment system and forced them to do a hard fork.
Then along came their concept of ICOs, and once again, they got hit with multiple hacks.  I didn't bother to follow the details on those, so I don't know if they happened in part because of design flaws or if it was just plain bad programming.
Regardless, the concept of "smart contracts" sounds really kewl but in practice it's sucked quite badly.  For one thing, there's no reversing the transaction if one party committed fraud, short of a hard fork or central authority like Ethereum.

One thing -- please DON'T try to spin up the drive at home, and DON'T have Microcenter(? whichever one you mentioned) try to do it in-store.  If any soot got in, for example because the little stickers covering the air pressure vent holes got melted, doing that could cause the head to grind into the drive surface.  Even worse if the platter warped (which isn't likely, hell, half the label is still readable, that drive was barely warmed up).  It really should get looked at by a professional data recovery service that will open it up in a cleanroom and sanitize the platter before they try to read it.

Is there a Bitcoin exchange in Iran?  Or a BTM (Bitcoin ATM) in your area?  If neither, you will have to try to find someone locally who has some, and buy from them.  Some possible exchanges:
CoinATMRadar doesn't list any BTMs in Iran, but you can check back from time to time to see if anyone has started one.
You can generate a Bitcoin address pair (public address and private key) by downloading the code from bitaddress.org onto your own computer.  You'll want to get that code from a known-good repository, and maybe even download several copies from different repositories and compare them to make sure they aren't modified.  You can publish the public address (which begins with a '1') to receive BTC at that address, and keep the private key (which begins with a '5') secret from everyone.
For best security, run that on a dedicated OFFLINE computer in a web browser.  Personally, I use a Raspberry Pi, and I never connect it to the internet.  You can use these keys for cold storage, and use a sweep transaction to move BTC to a "hot wallet" for spending when you need to.
As others have mentioned, you can also use a hardware wallet.  They usually have good security, [although a major flaw was just found in the Trezor that allows a hacker to bypass its security features](
For quick spending and distribution, rushwallet.com might or might not still be working.  The last time I used it, my browser crashed and the BTC that I had sent to it got frozen.  I haven't tried using it since then.  Someone told me that the BTC is recoverable, but I haven't managed to do it yet.  Be very careful if you use online services like this.
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:54:44


Wrong.  Any transaction can be a "taxable event".  There are specific rules about what DOESN'T constitute a taxable event, such as selling one piece of real-estate and using the money to purchase another (typically selling your existing home to buy a new home) -- but anything that doesn't fall within one of those rules IS BY DEFAULT a taxable event.
If you barter (which is what the IRS considers swapping cryptocurrencies around to be), you are required to figure out your gains on what you "sold" in USD-equivalent and pay taxes on that.

The decision is less than you guys are thinking.  This was basically a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that the insurer already paid out what they were supposed to, because as "money" the lost Bitcoin would be subject to a policy limit of $200.  The judge decided that the case could proceed because the plaintiff argued that Bitcoin is "property" (which he decided on the basis of that IRS decision, which was apparently the only document from a legal authority that was submitted as an argument -- the insurance company's lawyers filed some news articles calling it a "digital currency", which is about as binding or persuasive as all the reddit leftards who keep calling me a "Russian bot"), therefore not subject to the limit.  This was NOT a final judgment.  
Here's the court's ruling:
They still haven't even gone to trial yet.  Plenty of time to look into the possibility of fraud, make the customer prove that the property was stolen, and decide whether or not the theft of a digital asset even qualifies as something covered under the policy.
In particular the judge mentions this on the top of page 2:


Plaintiff 
moves 
for 
judgment 
on 
the 
pleadings, 
as 
Plaintiff 
failed 
to 
submit 
a 
proof 
of 
loss, 
pursuant 
to 
the 
contract. 
The 
Court 
finds 
this 
second 
argument 
to 
be 
outside 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
pleadings, 
and 
therefore 
more 
suitable 
for 
summary 
judgment. 
Accordingly, 
the 
Court 
denies 
this 
claim 
as 
procedurally 
improper. 
Defendant 
is 
welcome 
to 
raise 
a 
similar 
argument 
in 
a 
motion 
for 
summary 
judgment 
after 
the 
proper 
amount 
of 
time 
for 
discovery 
has 
passed. 
"Proof of loss" is going to be difficult, since the plaintiff is going to have to show that they were in fact stolen, not merely moved to a new address still under his control.
If I were the insurance company, I would argue that the Bitcoin was stored on "the Blockchain" and therefore was never present in the guy's house.  All the guy was in possession of were the addresses that the Bitcoin was stored on, and he still retains those addresses.
Not clear is whether the guy suffered a physical loss, such as the theft of a hard drive during a burglary.

There are plenty of rich people who got rich because they managed to ride some wave up, not because they put in the hard work.  Remember all the dot.com millionaires?  For every Elon Musk, there were half a dozen guys who imploded.
I got stock options in a company I went to work for right at about its peak dot.com value.  I saw my coworkers who had been there for years lose nearly everything when the stock crashed.  One in particular did a lot worse -- he figured that after the initial plunge from $80 to $20, surely the company couldn't go any lower, so he negotiated an absolutely mindbogglingly stupid deal with a brokerage firm to let him buy on margin against his shares, with the margin not being callable during any of the company's "quiet periods".  By the end of the first period, with the company stock at around $5, he wasn't just bankrupt, he was completely fucked.
I never gained anything from those options, so I didn't lose anything.  In fact, I made about $2000 off the ESPP stock I bought (they gave a 15% discount on the buy price) by dumping it.
The same is holding true nowadays.  Twitter, Snapchat, and all the other second-generation "dot com" companies have been slowly collapsing in value.  I wonder how many of their employees didn't realize that it was all just bubble-blowing.

I originally had that in my comment, but having read through the whole thread and the thread in TIFU that he posted about it, it sounds like the fire started around or in the computer.  Could have been the power cord or octopus outlet, of course, rather than inside the computer.
A few years ago, some scumbag expat sold me a space heater, and I specifically asked him if he'd had any fire-related problems with it.  He gave me what was probably the most obnoxious answer that I've ever heard -- "No, but I hope you do."  I almost walked away, and it turns out I should have, because the plug was defective (internal arcing from bad wire-to-prong contact) and it set the outlet on fire.  If I ever run into him again I will beat the shit out of him, and I don't mean that in an abstract sense.  There's absolutely no way that he didn't know about it.

If he has an extra $100K laying around, currently stuffed into the stock market, that he wouldn't miss if it evaporated, putting half of that into Bitcoin isn't going to ruin him, and doing that may insulate him from the current outrageously-overvalued stock market.

I have.  Bitcoin has very little utility for day-to-day transactions.  For buying stuff across borders, it is great.  I've also used it to fund a few projects that I support.
IMHO the real value will come when it is used regularly on the web to pay for purchases. Right now, filesharing services want ridiculous amounts of money for a month (or a year) of "subscription".  I have absolutely no interest in paying $30 for a month, when that one filehost has just one single file that I want.  When the model becomes "send us five cents in Bitcoin", it becomes worthwhile for me to pay for downloads.
Same goes for countless more services and virtual products.

Let's try a couple of experiments.
1. Take USB drive
2. Write critical information onto USB drive
3. Put USB drive in closet for six months
4. Take USB drive out of closet
5. Plug USB drive into computer
6. Recoil in horror as error messages spew out of machine telling you that the USB drive is unreadable
Flash memory has to be re-powered-up frequently in order to retain data. The electric charges that are stored (or not stored) in memory cells leak out over time, no matter what.  The time varies for every data bit on the drive;  beyond a few months it can get very flaky.  USB drives should never, ever be relied upon for long-term cold storage.
In contrast:
1. Take hard drive
2. Write critical data onto hard drive
3. Put hard drive into closet for ten years
4. Take hard drive out of closet
5. Plug hard drive into computer
6. Enjoy your data, as fresh as it was a decade earlier
The only significant dangers to hard drives are physical, such as from a house fire or losing it in a landfill, and obsolescence, such as from trying to find a SCSI-to-USB2.0 adapter for that 80MB hard disk that was blazing fast super new technology in 1992.

Not really, a patent is enforceable until it has been invalidated.
With that said, this isn't a patent, it is a "utility model" (see the 'U' on the end?), which under China's system means that it hasn't been examined yet, and the examination occurs WHEN they file a lawsuit.  So it will now get examined, and most likely it will get thrown out.  It would be useful for people to crowdsource prior art against it so that it does get nuked.

In less than one year,they've expanded by 5X over all previous years of their existence.  How are they going to survive?  Everyone has to run Hadoop with an array of drives to handle a 100TB blockchain?
ETH did one thing right -- they found an actual economic use case for crypto in the form of ICOs.  Unfortunately, most of the "companies" that flocked into ICOs were scams, which is going to cause them problems.
Then of course there's the whole "you can run CODE on our distributed network!"  So one silly little cat game brought the network to its knees. . . .

Yes, the U.S. government requires you to pay taxes on any net gains you make.  The two possible taxable events are acquisition (if you receive it as income or from mining) and disposition (when you trade it for something else, whether cash or a boat or food or whatever).
Upon acquisition, unless you acquired it for its fair market value by paying for it, you have to pay taxes on it at its fair market price.  In other words, if you get paid in BTC for mowing lawns or programming software, you pay taxes on it as income.  If you trade for it, you pay taxes based on your gain (if any) in the transaction.
Upon disposition, you pay the difference between your basis cost and the present cost.  In other words, if you bought some BTC at $240, and you sell it at $3288 to buy a boat, you pay taxes on the $3048 net gain.  You may be required to prove your basis cost (especially if audited), i.e., the government may try to pretend you got it out of thin air and have to pay on the whole $3288.

Futures aren't settled in BTC, so it doesn't matter whether the price of Bitcoin rises or falls, no BTC will be bought or sold based on them.
Consequently, I do not see how they can hold back (or boost) the price.  There's no link between the underlying BTC and the futures contract.

But the gold content could, and can, still be checked through assaying.

1. You're an idiot.
2. Currently, it obviously helps Venezuelans because they are running mining rigs to generate BTC, which means that instead of getting $200 per BTC that they mine, they get $7000 per BTC that they mine.
3. Even if they end up buying BTC with their shitpaper, it's neutral, because they get just as much overseas purchasing power at $7000 as their shitpaper would have gotten them at $200.
4. If the price rises after they buy, they get a little bonus.
5. And in fact, even if the price falls after they buy, it doesn't matter because their shitpaper's "value" willl drop by roughly 20% every DAY at the current rate of hyperinflation in Venezuela.
6. Their shitpaper is completely worthless anyway, especially since the government appears to be about to default on their bonds at long last.

1. Generate a list of public-private key pairs using an offline computer or even a hardware wallet.
2. Put a list of all the public keys into a file.
3. Use each public key once as a payment address for any customer requesting the Bitcoin payment option.
4. Figure out how you're going to handle the price volatility -- do you want to sell your glasses for a fixed amount of BTC or for a fixed amount of USD/EUR/THB/whatever?
5. If you want to fix your prices in something other than BTC, write a script that grabs a price quote from whatever source you want, converts from your selected currency to BTC/currency, and displays the price to the customer.
6. Be very damn sure you keep your private keys and the seed to generate them private.
7. (not essential as long as your security in \ is good, but may be more convenient for you) From time to time, do a transaction that transfers all the BTC off the individual addresses and sends it to your cold storage addresses or a series thereof.

That's actually not humor, Goldman pulls that on its clients all the time.
Remember the 2008 mortgage crisis?  Goldman prepared for that by creating CDOs to sell to clients, dumping their exposure to the market on their hapless fools of clients.  Goldman then SHORTED the bonds, doubling their money.
Remember the dot.com boom?  Goldman was one of many firms that, in their private inside-the-company emails, called certain stocks garbage, yet pumped them to their clients.
This is even more true for public announcements to anyone who wants to read Goldman's propaganda.

Up initially, then down very hard.
What doesn't understand is that "money" in the sense of fiat can be destroyed.  My favorite example is a stock that I had been following on the recommendation of a newsletter I read for a while.  It was some sort of eye surgery center chain.  They got an adverse court ruling in the EU, "after hours" for the U.S. stock market, and overnight the stock plunged 40%.  The money didn't move anywhere, it simply evaporated.
If that happens enough, then while early movers can shift their money into other stocks, bonds, commodities, pieces of paper with complicated printing on them, or whatever, the ones who held out simply lose everything.  Then, for at least some of those, they have to cover other expenses.  Suddenly they're selling all the things that didn't lose money in order to pay off debts.
So, if there is a big enough crash, then everything goes down.  This is "deflation" in the fiat world.  There is less money to chase after stocks, bonds, blah blah blah, therefore these things all cost "less" in terms of fiat.
This is why, during the 2008 meltdown, on some days gold got slammed -- all those hedge funds that owned gold as part of their inventories had to dump it to cover margin calls on their stocks, otherwise they'd blow up completely.  You'd see a stock crash, then they'd get a notice of having to cover the losses within the next couple of days, and then gold would drop as they unloaded that too.  Yes, the overall trend for gold was up because it's an unrisky asset and people were fleeing for safety, but in the aftermath of the crashes they were forced to cover.
When you are pricing bitcoin in terms of U.S. dollars, you have to deal with reality as it applies to U.S. dollars too.  If the economy were 100% bitcoin, or 100% gold, there would be no destruction of wealth during a collapse -- the physical (or in the case of bitcoin, the virtual) just gets transferred.
Eventually, people are buying stretch limos for $100 on the streets of NYC.
Bitcoin has the "lost coins" phenomenon, though, so the comparison diverges there.
Edit: hi True dat.

There are basically two ways to stop it: (1) somehow force a hard fork over the objections of the cheating miners, such that the change in algorithms makes it impossible for them to use covert asicboost, or (2) have the patent owners sue the cheating miners into oblivion, if and when they ever get a patent in China (since that's where most of the cheating miners appear to be).
The first option would be cheaper, but runs the risk of harming Bitcoin's reputation even further and possibly even causing those miners to gain control (if the side of the fork that the economic activity follows turns out to be their side).
The second option would probably require financing from the community, because litigating in China is expensive and uncertain.

I appreciate the thought, but let's hold off until we know whether a third-party observation needs to be filed.  If SIPO doesn't know about the Hanke application yet, then I'll crowdsource the filing fees (I think last time I had one filed, it was about US$1000 -- SIPO doesn't charge much, but the Chinese attorneys do);  if SIPO does know, then all we can do is wait to see if they reject Jihan's application -- and if they eventually allow it, we can then worry about whatever post-issuance proceedings SIPO has.
One good thing, this means that Jihan doesn't have a patent (as some comments have claimed -- I don't know if they're quoting him on it or are just assuming).  So he can't yet block anyone from using ASICBOOST in China.
With their much earlier priority, and having filed in China, the Hanke group should be able to shut down Jihan once they get their patent issued.  I'll have to remember to ask about that application as well.
I really hope the U.S. application hasn't ended up under a secrecy order.  There was one crypto patent filed around WW2 that just issued as a patent in the last few years, long after the inventor died -- the feds finally decided that cryptography had advanced so far that they could give his heirs a totally useless participation trophy.

The current patents are already prior art against anyone else filing.  Any new filing on the basic ASICBOOST method would be invalid.
You either have to come up with a different way of doing the same thing, or an improvement upon it (which is then dependent on the basic patent and would not be usable without licensing the basic patent, at least in the countries in which the basic patent was valid).
This is why I am saying that the Chinese filing is probably invalid -- from the comments I've seen, they didn't invent anything new, they just copied the original and hoped it wouldn't be noticed.
If anyone has the patent numbers of both the European patent (whatever country or countries it was filed/issued in) and the Chinese one, I am willing to take a look at them.  I looked for the inventor names in the USPTO database and didn't find anything there -- just an unrelated application about some sort of webpage server method.

Only if and after their patent issues.  They filed in China, so eventually they can.
Google Patents, when looking at that Chinese application CN106415530, shows that it was just published a couple of months ago, and doesn't mention that it has entered into examination.  I am guessing Jihan paid for accelerated examination (depending on the country, you can sometimes get a patent to issue within a few months), whereas Hanke is letting the application follow the default path (typically 3-5 years).
I'll ask a colleague to look into the applications to see what's going on. Depending on the situation, it might be worthwhile to the community to help Hanke crowdsource the fees for accelerated examination.  Depends on a lot of different things.

@_date: 2017-04-19 08:40:57




That's not what happens when something is patented.
First, nobody has a patent on it yet.
Second, Jihan Wu sells his mining rigs in addition to using them himself.  Even if he gets the patent, by selling his mining rigs that use the technology, the buyers would get a license.
Third, Jihan Wu's patent application is only in China (AFAIK).  That means he can only enforce it (if it ever issues as a patent) in China.  Other countries don't have to worry about his patent application.
Fourth, the true inventors, who are in Europe, filed in China, the U.S., and possibly elsewhere.  They also haven't been issued a patent yet.  They are looking to license their technology.  So, any company that buys a license can make, use, sell, etc., an ASICBOOST miner.
Fifth, anywhere where the technology isn't patented, anyone can use it anyway.
Sixth, if there were no patent system, the original inventors would never have had an incentive to disclose the method, and they probably would have ended up using it as a trade secret -- which WOULD ABSOLUTELY have led to massive centralization, unquestionably above 51%, since they would have had a constant 20% advantage over everyone else for all time.  Eventually they would have owned the entire system, period.
So thank whatever gods you believe in that there is a patent system and that they filed in it, because otherwise we would be absolutely fucked.
Tagging so he'll see this.
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:40:31


That doesn't even make sense.  How does any specific mining rig know whether it is owned by the same pool as another mining rig?  What prevents centralization of the ownership of the hardware?  What prevents an investor from buying voting rights for everyone's mining rigs?  "I'll pay you 1BTC to set your dozen miners to signaling for BU."
The only way to try for something like that would be to get every government on the planet to agree to go after mining pools with antitrust/competition laws.

Ah.  Well, if you want to create some sort of DNSCoin that is tied in with DNS, go for it.  But they are two completely separate things.  It's like why we don't write MS-Word documents using DNS records.
As far as why you need "long strings", IIRC the address is 256 bits long, and that gets encoded into a human-readable string that is 53 bytes long.  Security is a function of length;  every one bit shorter means half the computational time to guess.  If you want a 16 bit address because that's really easy to use, then that address can be guessed in under a second.  Right now, some group is using GPUs to randomly guess at addresses and has found a few -- and they're ahead of where they should be, either through luck or because there was/is a RNG flaw in (at least) some address generators.
Your statement is sort of like saying "I think we should use existing Newtonian physics when trying to describe quantum mechanics."  Ok, good luck with that.

Maybe there are some uses for that, but for the most part addresses shouldn't be reused. Wallet software can handle the change addresses automatically, and when you transmit a payment request, the other party's wallet software can just read it in and send to it.
It is useful to make domain names memorable because people are typing them in by hand.  Nobody is going to type a payment address in by hand -- you want the security of knowing that you've used the correct address, which means automation.

Yes!  That looks like the Chinese one.
The summary you linked doesn't list an issue date, which makes me hopeful that it can still have third-party submissions filed against it, but I don't know if SIPO publishes its patents separately.  (The USPTO has two different search tools, one for applications and one for issued patents;  it's a bit of a pain TBH.  SIPO might or might not do the same thing, I dunno.)
Google Patents likewise doesn't list it as issued, but does list it as having entered into the examination stage on February 10 2016.
The priority date on their China application is 2015-08-21.
The AsicBoost.com website says Timo Hanke and Sergio Lerner are the inventors, but doesn't list the countries.  I have searched the USPTO publications and there is nothing in those, despite their company having a U.S. phone number.  If they had filed in the U.S. prior to 2015-08-21 then it should have published by now (unless it's gotten bottled up on a national security hold, which can happen on cryptographic applications).
I've found it on ESpaceNet:

It looks like they've filed it in China as well as the EU and US.  What's really strange is that the U.S. application isn't showing up on either Google Patents or the USPTO search site (even when searching under the US publication number that the EPO lists in their summary) -- the only thing I can think of is that it may have gotten put under a national security hold because of cryptography.  But considering it's been filed and published elsewhere that would be bizarre.
In any case, the filing date was a couple of years before Jihan's, so it is definitely prior art against Jihan's and should already be known to SIPO.  I'll talk to one of my local colleagues to see if he can pull the OAs from SIPO and tell me what's going on there.

@_date: 2017-04-07 01:38:49
Jihan is the one who would be suing for infringement.  As a Chinese citizen, he would have a relatively easy time winning.
The way to negate that threat is by stopping the patent from issuing.  SIPO gets prior art submissions anonymously and will consider them fairly.  That is why it is important to file oppositions, which are done to SIPO before the application is allowed.
tl;dr: I actually know how this shit works, and you obviously don't.

@_date: 2017-04-27 18:51:48


Well, let's face reality here:  with Jihan demanding that "his" miners not signal SegWit as a condition of doing business with him, this killswitch means that we can get rid of all of Jihan's products and retake control of the direction of Bitcoin without his interference.
We should immediately brick all of his miners.  Every last one of them.  Eventually, the hashing power will return -- with Jihan having to play on a level playing field, and without his having any more say over SegWit or LN.

I doubt that your hunch is correct.  Microsoft would have no say in that.  It's a question of whether the courts would accept it as validation that the document was the same.
Much looser evidentiary standards than that are used to validate documents all the time.  Things like "records kept in the ordinary course of business", for example (because it's not like a business would forge its records, ever, right?).

I can't say I love what they're doing, but one of the marketing points for Bitcoin has always been that your coins are secure.
They are demonstrating that even though the keyspace is huge, they can still use specialized hardware to do a brute-force attack and get lucky occasionally.
Concern over this type of attack is why I don't keep everything on one address.  Scattering my funds makes it more likely that I might get hurt, but limits the damage.
It would be glorious and terrifying if they stumbled onto the key for Satoshi's fabled lost stash.
@_date: 2017-04-27 19:22:08
Doesn't work that way.  If BTC is not used in the economy, then any real-world valuation is as shallow as a penny stock.  One sucker buys, and it spikes 2000%;  one sucker sells and it crashes to almost zero.
You kiddies keep jawing about "muh security" and "muh hashrate".  They are completely meaningless if Bitcoin is not actively being used for commerce.  Just look at how great PotCoin is doing.

Serious answer, you wanna know why crypto in general is crashing?  Because the valuation got waaaaaaaaaaaaay ahead of the actual economic uses for it.
Bitcoin soared because everyone was piling into ETHEREUM to get in on all the ICO scams.  It was easier to buy BTC and exchange for ETH than to find an exchange that dealt in ETH directly.
But now there's a huge -- justifiable -- crackdown on the ICO scams, and people are realizing that, hey, these were all scams anyway, and so money is no longer flowing in and through Bitcoin.
Suddenly, there's no economic use for it.  A few places accept it, many more want to accept it, but hardly anyone actually \*is* accepting it.
So it's crashing.
Because unless and until something is actually used for real-world things, it is valueless.  As in, it doesn't have a value.  No one gives a shit about having an address populated with some "unspent outputs" (whatever the fuck those are, amirite?) sitting on a bunch of hard drives, SSDs, and flash drives on people's computers all over and around the globe.
You want to see Bitcoin rise again?  Get it to be *used in commerce*.  Spend some, you idiots.  And replenish it if you feel like getting more.
Because if nobody is spending 10,000BTC on a couple of pizzas, or 0.0529937BTC on a new laptop, or 0.00001027 on a Snickers bar, or 0.00000582 on a new Lamborgini, then 21,000,000BTC is worth NaN.
 there's no such thing as a "store of value" for a thing that isn't used for economic purposes.**

@_date: 2017-04-17 10:33:48
Can it?  Ok, I confess my crypto isn't anywhere near up to knowing.  I guess I misunderstood some (probably most) of the debate.
Anyway, with the patent side, they need an enforceable right -- i.e., an issued patent -- before they can sue.  I don't know how the Chinese damages calculations are done;  in the U.S. it's only post-issuance, with 35 USC 154(d) for preissuance "reasonable royalties" in *very* limited cases.
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:21:45
Sure it can.  If they really have a Chinese patent, then no other company **inside China** can use that particular method, or make and sell equipment implementing it -- but anyone in any other country can do either.  (Note, this assumes they haven't filed any applications or received any patents outside of China.  I have seen nothing in the reports so far to indicate that they have done so.)
But so far it sounds more like they fraudulently applied for a patent, even though they didn't have any rights -- the information was created by someone else with no relationship to the company.  If so, all that needs to be done is for someone to file an observation with SIPO showing that this is the case, and then the false applicant will lose all of their rights to the application.
But in any case, nobody WANTS this particular energy-saving method, because the computational simplification is based on a defect in the protocol, and using that defect breaks everything else that people want to do.  Therefore, the rest of the network should simply stop accepting defective blocks, and should move forward with other BIPs that (i) repair the defect and (ii) use features that will improve the ecosystem even if that causes those who are using the defect to lose money.

Try living in Venezuela.  Would you rather be paid in bolivars or in Bitcoin?
Try living in South Africa, where the government recently announced that they would print enough money to give everyone a billion dollars if necessary to drag them out of poverty.  Think that's gonna work?  They're also trying to pass a new law that would allow for confiscation of property (any property of any kind, although it's being pitched as a way to seize farms) from whites without any compensation.  Would you rather hang on to rand or your land, or grab some Bitcoin?
How about Brazil, where currency controls make it a pain in the ass to move money around, especially out of the country?  Even if you want to buy business equipment?  Would you prefer to have a way to make those transactions instantly without getting government approval?
Or maybe you aren't lucky enough to be born a financial wizard in the U.S.  Maybe you're some Filipino maid working in Hong Kong.  And you need to send money home every month for your kids.  Would you rather give Western Union a 20% fee, or use Bitcoin for a few pennies?
And who could possibly want to set up an online shop on the web and be able to accept payments from anyone around the entire planet, instantly and securely?  No possible use for that, right?
As for volatility, you can use an exchange to convert instantly into your local currency in most countries.  Maybe you'll gain a few cents or lose a few cents, but it's likely to be a better rate than that 2% for credit cards.

The author is claiming that because some countries have decided that converting EUR-to-BTC doesn't incur VAT, that you can then buy a computer with BTC and not have to pay VAT on the computer.
This is flat out wrong, and following this advice -- either by the sellers or the buyers -- will result in criminal prosecution and tax penalties if the government ever notices people doing this.

He held for less than a year, so it's taxed at ordinary income rates.  IIRC it's 39% for income in the six-figure range, which he hit by selling 8 BTC in December ($80K to almost $160K depending on his transaction date) after buying at $900 in early 2017, on top of his income of $47K.  Also, it looks like he's in California, which hit him with another 10% or so.

Yeah, the author did say that. and guess what, the author is a moron.  The assets fall under the same provisions as any other property settlement in a divorce.  Speaking generally (and using typical U.S. laws), if they were purchased with marital assets, then they are equally shared between the spouses;  if they were purchased with separate funds (e.g., an inheritance) then they are usually the purchasing party's sole property, including the gains on them.  A prenup might also affect the outcome one way or the other if the parties signed one.  Divorce court judges often fuck over the male party to the case, however, "because it's not fair!!!!" so there's always that.

Probably not, then.  Big media companies pick a bias and then shill it as hard as they can;  they are not now and never have been neutral actors.  The most famous was undoubtedly when ["Dateline NBC" used model rocket engines to ignite a grass fire behind a truck and then claimed that the truck caught on fire because of a gas tank rupture](  However, ["60 Minutes" has also been caught at similar frauds, as when they used a compressed air tank to fake a scene where an Audi transmission began "spontaneously" accelerating](  And of course there was Dan Rather's forced retirement from "60 Minutes" as well as from CBS News after [he kept pushing the fake Bush National Guard memo long after it had been proven a fraud because it claimed to be written in 1973 but miraculously used MS-Word fonts and spacing](

Are you affiliated with Little Dragon?  Did you acquire the rights to the U.S. application?  Was the U.S. application revived?
I am skeptical and think you are trying to scam people with this, because AFAIK the original application went abandoned after Terra went out of business.  In any event, it is far too late to file a PCT, because the original application was published years ago, and you have at most one year from the earliest possible priority date in which to file a PCT.  Even if a PCT had been filed, it dies after 30 months (31 or 32 in a few jurisdictions, I think, I've only filed a couple of PCT applications).
The original application is already prior art, and if it's dead, then it is already "dedicated to the public", nothing more needs to be done.  If it isn't already abandoned due to failure to respond to the USPTO, then all you have to do is file for abandonment and voila.
The fact that you are "accepting donations" and are mentioning that you will make the "patent" available defensively "once the PCT patent has been granted", even though it's way too late to file one, screams SCAMSCAMSCAMSCAMSCAM at me.

People need to chill out about these "patent attack" terrors.  If you think that someone is going to be able to significantly affect Bitcoin through patents, then you don't understand IP.
* Satoshi's original white paper is prior art against all patent applications everywhere.
* An application is not a patent;  it may never issue, or its claims may have limitations that mean that they cannot be applied to the current Bitcoin ecosystem.
* Patents are national in scope;  an Australian patent doesn't mean shit to people outside Australia.
* Method claims in particular have to have all steps of the method performed in the same country by the same actor.
It's not "OMG he haz patent application, Bitcoin iz d00000m3d!"  Pretty much the only way that someone would be able to have a significant effect is (1) to come up with something new that nobody else has thought of doing already, (2) file applications in multiple major countries, (3) talk the Core developers into implementing the never-been-heard-of-before technology, (4) get the patents, and then (5) demand control over the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.  At which point, (6) he will be laughed at, because there are laws that restrict standards-essential patents, such as FRAND licensing terms.  This happened in the DRAM memory space a decade or so ago, and the company that tried it got its asshole expanded by the courts.

No need to worry, at least in the U.S. your assets acquired before marriage are usually your sole property as long as you don't commingle them.  To be extra-safe you can move them into a trust fund and define how they are to be used and how to dispose of them upon your currently-inevitable death.  Check with a lawyer in your state (and in any state that you and your spouse move to and gain residency in) to be sure, though.
Frankly, men in the U.S. have a lot more to fear from child support than from divorce, since there is no way to protect yourself and judges routinely ignore the law to apply their own biases, e.g., refusing to acknowledge paternity fraud when the woman had a baby from an affair, refusing to reduce child support obligations when the father has a material change in employment or health, and giving lottery-winner-level support when the father happens to be well-off.  And marriage will actually help with that since then you don't have to cut a separate post-tax check to her every month. . . .

It's being used all over Asia for remittances, such as Filipina maids in Hong Kong sending money home to their families.  They are paying 3% for the service instead of the former 20% that they were getting robbed of by their labor companies, WU, and other sleazeballs.
As an expat living in Asia, not being able to get a credit card locally thanks to Obama's FATCA nonsense and not being allowed to keep one by my bank back home thanks to "you're not in the U.S.", I've used it to purchase and ship goods internationally.
People in Venezuela are keeping themselves from starving to death thanks to Bitcoin.

How is gold a "reliable store of value" when governments historically just dictated the price ratio and often alloyed it without telling anyone?  Since abandoning the gold standard, have you seen what gold is priced in in dollars (or any other currency)?
Oh, right, it's a reliable store of value because *despite all of that* it still can be exchanged for goods and services at rates that are significantly advantageous to savers when compared to how their fiat currencies hold up.
In case you hadn't noticed, the USD has dropped against other fiat currencies by about 12% in just the last year.

1. They want power.
2. They think that they can force everyone to go along with them.
3. They think that if they can force everyone to go along with them once, they can do it again.
4. They think that centralizing control over Bitcoin will personally enrich them far more than non-control would do, even if everyone else loses.  See also: Kim Jong Un.
IIRC, Jihan's proposal six months or so ago would have given him centralized control to change whatever he wanted.  Remove the 21mil limit, force fees higher, whatever.  He'd be able to rake in the cash no matter what -- and even if that meant the complete ruin of Bitcoin, he'd still end up worth billions instead of mere hundreds of millions.  So, yay?

In reading this clause, what it says is that if P1 licenses Patent from X, and X sues other P(n) for infringement of Patent, then all licenses to P1 under the BDPL are revoked.
Yes, it's a poison pill.  These are what defensive licenses are always about, although this particular clause is much more aggressive than most.  It's like the difference between the older GPL versions and the newer ones -- the newer ones are trying to force companies that use GPL'ed libraries to open-source their own private software, while the older ones were just trying to prevent companies from making GPL'ed code private.
If it works, it will mean that all companies that join the BDPL cannot use significantly-related patents from non-BDPL companies, because any threat of enforcement by those non-BDPL companies will cause the licenses to be revoked.  This will likely lead to more things being kept as trade secrets if they are major competitive advantages.

No specific experience, but if you are holding on a foreign exchange then you would probably be required to report it as a foreign account.  If you bought and transmitted it to an address you control personally, then you do not;  this was the subject of a crypto bill in Congress last year, but I don't believe it gained any traction.  If you find out differently, please let me know.
I have to report the stock grant that a former employer gave me through a foreign brokerage (in the country the company is headquartered in).

It was mostly because of all the ICOs.  Even though those are based on Ethereum, there are so few Ethereum exchanges that people found it easier to buy Bitcoin and trade that for Ethereum to get ICO tokens.

It's pretty simple, really.
1. Jihan Wu built a business selling mining rigs and doing his own mining.
2. One day while reading patent applications, Jihan discovered that someone had come up with a technique to reduce the computational needs for mining.
3. Jihan found that the company that had filed the patent application went out of business and didn't file in China
4. Jihan secretly implemented the technique.
5. Meanwhile, the entire community was moving forward with a technology called "segregated witness", or "segwit" for short, which would allow for all sorts of neat things.
6. Jihan found that the technique that was making him rich was incompatible with segwit, and if segwit was implemented, he'd be just another miner.
7. Jihan spread lots of FUD about how horrible segwit was.
8. A lot of people were brainwashed by the FUD.
9. Jihan attempted to use all the BTC he'd made with his mining scam to sabotage Bitcoin and drive up mining fees, which would make him even richer.
10. Jihan got caught on all of this.
11. Jihan came up with other schemes to sabotage Bitcoin and further centralize control.
12. The people who believe in the lies, or who benefit from making others believe in the lies, are the ones who inhabit Feel free to look at both sides of the "debate", but in the end it boils down to a few people who gained some power early on trying to screw everyone else for their own profits.

OP, your title is bad, and you should feel bad.  It's very misleading.
MS is talking about its valuation research/forecast for AMD, whose main business is selling GPUs, which are used in Ethereum and Litecoin and other altcoin/shitcoin mining.
Ethereum took off because of ICOs, which governments are (justifiably) banning (because 99% of them are scams).  Someone else wrote here a few weeks ago, "People are going to go to jail."  I believe that that is going to happen too.
Bitcoin isn't mined by GPUs any longer.  MS may not be differentiating -- maybe they think people will give up on Bitcoin too, or maybe they think people will just give up on all the shitcoin scams and flood back into Bitcoin (which already has been happening, soooooooo. . . .).  The article doesn't say anything about that either way.

If you were to have the gain in one year and the loss in a subsequent year, you would owe the taxes on the $100 in the first year and would have a loss in the following year.  You could apply that loss against the rest of your income, though (up to some limit, and then you have to carry over the losses from year to year until you have some gains or income to apply them against).

At today's ETH price that was around a $1,500,000,000 screwup.  So, yah, "giga".

This is false.  If you purchase a product that uses a licensed technology, then you get a sublicense with the purchase.  Otherwise end-users would never be able to use the equipment that they purchase without entering into separate licensing agreements, which is obviously not how the world works normally.

Anyone who watched the stock market in 2008 should remember that during a selloff, initially money flowed into gold, and then gold took a leg down because funds were forced to liquidate their holdings in order to cover other losses.
Hedge funds aren't big on Bitcoin yet, but individuals who get hurt may do the same.  The few hedge funds that have bought in may also need to cover other losses.
Also, one of the major finance news outlets oddly enough made a decent point a few days ago -- that Bitcoin is a "risk asset" and therefore does have some correlation with other markets;  as people seek risk-averse trades, they are NOT going to pile into something that has many times the volatility of the stock market and that has zero intrinsic value.  At least with a stock, the company has physical assets that make up its "book value", and regardless of whether the economy is in the toilet or is soaring people will need to buy certain things such as food to eat.

Therefore Bitcoin can be exchanged for goods and services.
The borrowers don't have to create more BTC out of thin air.  They have to create value, somehow, so that they can earn more BTC to pay back the loans.  This may mean working as a hairdresser, or producing the next great computer game, or begging on GoFundMe so that idiots can donate to virtue-signal, or blowing guys in a bus station bathroom.  Then they get BTC and can pay back the loan.

I'm well aware of the halvenings (halfenings? whatever) and the eventual near-zero mining reward.  That's why there are transaction fees, and also why I mention reducing capacity.  If it's not profitable to mine, then miners will shut down their rigs.  The system will adjust.  It's the same way that when the Florida orange crop gets hit with a bad winter frost, orange juice futures skyrocket, and a few months later people buy less orange juice because the price has risen.

If anyone had, for example, *registered a trademark* for Bitcoin as cryptocurrency, then BCash would not be able to use "Bitcoin Cash" as its intentionally-confusing shitcoin name.  If there were any *central authority* that could speak for Bitcoin as a whole, then that authority could still file a common-law trademark suit against Jihan and Coinbase for their *intentionally misleading and confusing* use of the term "Bitcoin Cash" to refer to their shitcoin -- in fact, this could have been done last August when the fork happened (holy shit, it hasn't even been a year?!?!) and saved everyone a lot of headaches.
Unfortunately, Nakamoto didn't think that far ahead, so he didn't register bitcoin.com, and didn't register a trademark on the name, and there is no central authority figure to do that at this point -- it would basically be a fucking legal nightmare to deal with.  Maybe the government could step in, but that of course would be *against the crypto-anarchist principles* ^^^waaaaaaah that so many pussies here whine about.
Too bad the Bitcoin Foundation was a bunch of shills and assholes who just tried to promote themselves and take great vacations on other people's money.  It's minimally possible they might have been able to present themselves as having standing.  I don't know if it would have worked (any more than PeTA trying to represent the "Selfie Monkey" in court to get recognition of the photo copyright, enforce it against places posting copies of the photo, and take all the money "in trust" for ~~their vacations and mansions and yachts~~ umm the monkey really I'm sure), but what the hell.
Anyway, at this point the main remedies would either be a class action suit against Coinbase and Jihan Wu for promoting their shitcoin under the confusing name "Bitcoin Cash" and defaulting users to use their shitcoin, or getting the government (like maybe the FTC) to step in and push Coinbase's shit in.  There may be other possibilities, but those would also likely violate *the crypto-anarchist principles* ^^^cough that so many whiny assholes here try to promote.

Example: move to Puerto Rico for a year (or maybe it's six months) and cash out all you want.  Example: move overseas for a year to a jurisdiction that doesn't tax capital gains (Hong Kong, Taiwan, a few others) and you can cash out your full exemption of whatever it is now (ten or twelve grand, I think) while getting the FEIE for your income.  Example: go get citizenship somewhere else that doesn't tax cap gains, renounce your U.S. citizenship, cash out, email Phil Greenspun and tell him to kiss your ass about taxes.

It's not that USD isn't popular, it's that there is no easy way to use it on the web or internationally without going through a bunch of intermediaries.
Cryptos will eventually be integrated into the web so that you can pay to download a file, view a newspaper article, or get a camslut to take her clothes off for you, all without converting from USD to JPY/CNY/CND/THB/TWD/EUR/RUB/whatever.  Filipino maids in Hong Kong can send their pay to their families without paying Western Union 8%.  People in tightly controlled systems like Brazil and Venezuela can buy goods internationally without having to hire people to stand in lines to get government approvals first.  People in third-world shitholes can save their money in a form that their shitty governments can't devalue any time that some Prime Minister decides he needs a new fleet of Mercedes, and they'll be able to use that money to buy goods anywhere in the world.

As I've mentioned before, I'm reasonably sure that their U.S. application got buried under a secrecy order -- either that or else the USPTO screwed up and forgot to publish it, which *can* happen, but that would be an odd coincidence.
It will be interesting to see what happens with it since the application was already published by WIPO and was filed in China.  Not much point to keeping it secret if it's already available on the internet, although I suppose it's possible that some of the arguments and references during prosecution could be why the PTO is hiding it.

Amazon is the one running the "shady business" or "scam".  They receive inventory direct from a manufacturer for the manufacturer's own "Amazon store".  Amazon promises, in their contract, that they won't mix that inventory with anyone else's.  Then Amazon sends out counterfeits from all the shitty Chinese companies that pretend they're selling "genuine" products that are "from" that manufacturer.  Then Amazon denies doing it and refuses to deal with the problem or compensate the manufacturer.

There's a difference between the quantity going up and the value getting diluted.  As long as the issuance is slow enough that the value doesn't get diluted, it's not "inflationary" in the sense that most people think about it.
The 1970s were inflationary for the dollar because the Federal Reserve was dumping so many fiat units into circulation that it was almost pointless to hold on to cash.  From 1972 to 1982, the purchasing power of the dollar dropped by about 80%.  (Yeah, I know what the government's stats say.  They lie constantly to understate purchasing power loss because they don't want people to start screaming.)
Bitcoin's purchasing power is going up.  Fast.  Because the increase in the number of units in the pool is much slower than its utility value is growing.

I mean, what else could have been done?  Their coins weren't at separate addresses, there was no way to figure out who owned which coins.  The withdrawals (if that really happened) were supposedly spaced out over time.  It might barely have been possible to figure out which specific addresses were used, but then people would need to find out whether those were used for legitimate purchases, resold to genuine buyers, or were sitting in "the hacker's" cold storage for eventual use.

Preface: I actually *am* a patent attorney.


You don't understand the system.  WIPO just does a preliminary search;  it doesn't get to "reject" any claims.  That is solely the provence of the national offices, because every country has different standards on what constitutes prior art.
When I looked for the application in the U.S., it appeared that the patent application had been sucked into the "[secrecy order]( netherworld.  One of the longest-pending patent applications in history was filed around WW2 and just issued within the last three years, because it was cryptography-related and got classified.


He does, it was filed years before Jihan's.  Jihan apparently paid for accelerated examination, while the European group did not.

If the thief got the password through "social engineering" at the exchange, then the exchange should theoretically be liable, but the guy is going to face a ridiculously hard battle proving that and forcing the exchange to refund his money, even assuming it's at all possible.  If the thief got the password by installing a keylogger on the guy's computer, he's fucked.

I haven't more than glanced at the secrecy order stuff since I studied for the patent bar;  I'll have to go look at my notes, but I don't remember anything that would stop the PTO from doing that.

Unfortunately, no.  I'm still struggling to understand the basic blockchain myself.
Also note, the reason it takes so much power is because there are so many miners desperately seeking to mine blocks.  If every mining pool were cut in half, the electricity usage would halve, and the only resulting effect would be that the difficulty would adjust down to allow one block every ten minutes at the new hash rate.
The network wouldn't be as "secure", but it's already secured beyond any rational point.

Only in common-law countries;  in registration-based systems such as China, Jihan could file to register "Electrum" all by itself and then extort the original authors and block them from using the name.  (There are a few hybrids, like Germany, but registration still takes precedence over mere past use and is a pain in the ass to fight.  And then there's Brazil, where they have multiple competing systems, at both federal and state levels, and protecting a trademark there is a fucking nightmare.)

I think you're missing the point.  People tend to stick to the same tools;  if someone bothered to use LaTeX to write a paper eight years ago, odds are that that person would use LaTeX to write a related paper today.  The fact that the two papers were written using very different systems (even if it wasn't LaTeX for the first one, but rather OpenOffice) gives one more bit of weight to the notion that they are authored by different people, and that Craig Wright therefore isn't Satoshi.
Same with the stylistic differences, the incorrect mathematical handwaving, and so on.

No, that is his avocation.  I would be surprised if he got hired at a law firm;  is he in solo practice?
At least as far as the gun stuff, his methods are counterproductive.  People have been legally making guns at home, following the 1968 Gun Control Act, ever since its passage.  Wilson jumping up and down and screaming "SEE WHAT I CAN DO!!!!!" only made it likely that GCA68 would get amended to prohibit that -- if Hillary Clinton had won last November, I have no doubt that she would have done exactly that (and even with Republican "control" of both houses of Congress, they'd be happy to sell us out to get some not-entirely-negative news articles about themselves, see Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, and any number of others).

Oh, and I'll just add -- if there were no way to get a patent on ASICBOOST, whoever came up with it would have just tried to use it internally as a trade secret -- eventually taking over the entire mining ecosystem thanks to the higher efficiency and MUCH higher profits, and being able to do whatever he wanted to do with Bitcoin because eventually he'd own way over 50% of mining and could make his own rules.

So, you're not actually "short", you just lost their money because the exchange you left their BTC on went out of business?
Sounds like you were negligent, but they were foolish for not taking an active role in handling their own finances.  Negotiate with them and see if you can agree on something;  if not, then maybe you'll lose them as friends, or maybe they'll sue you.  Welcome to adulthood.

Yes, the image in the OP is one such example.
What you posted are two more examples.  Neither one is the be-all-and-end-all only-possible-model.  There are an infinite number of possible distributed system maps.  Any or all of them may be best suited for any particular purpose.
The one shown in the OP image is just fine for what the Lightning Network is doing.

No it fucking isn't.  He has an application on file, not an issued patent.  And if you mean Jihan Wu, his patent is a ripoff of an earlier-filed one that some Europeans filed for a U.S. company, and so Jihan isn't going to get his patent unless SIPO fucks up.

And the huge backlogs can disappear.  Especially if it prevents Jihan from gaming the system so that he can mine lots of empty blocks, thus tying it up further.

Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.  That was one of the charges he was convicted on.

You think that's bad, you should look at the purchasing power of a dollar since the Federal Reserve was legislated into existence. :-(
(BTW, gold's purchasing power has gone up quite a bit since then . . . which is largely why FDR confiscated it from everyone.)

There would likely be high volatility when major players who have other liabilities are forced to cash out in order to cover their other losses.  However, overall, it would likely rise, and then fall after the broader economy begins to recover.
For an example, look at what happened to gold during 2007-present.  2-3 days after any major stock market drop, gold followed suit because the major players had to cover their margin losses by selling off other assets.  However, on a broader time scale, gold rose to a peak of around 1800 or so.  Then it declined to a new higher base range of 1100-1300.
One issue is that Bitcoin tends to be held less by hedge funds and more by random geeks, so I think the volatility will be more randomized -- some days, a hedge fund that doesn't have any BTC will get hammered and will sell off its gold, other days a hedge fund that has BTC will get hammered and will sell off both its Bitcoin and its gold.
Some people may see it as a safe haven, others may see it as having no intrinsic value.  I would expect it to rise since it is not tied to any one currency or central bank -- no one can devalue it or confiscate it.

How are you going to prevent it?
And yes, we should "allow" them.  Because if the Euros had gotten their patent (in China) instead of shutting down their company and sitting idle for four years, they could sue Jihan into oblivion now.  Wouldn't that be nice?

The fact that it is pending means that there aren't any "legal actions" that can be taken yet.  Quotes from your article:


There's no "infringement", because infringement only occurs when there is an issued patent to infringe.  The law firm was blowing smoke.  Frankly, the letter (yes, I read the whole thing when it first came out) seemed to me to border on being sanctionable.


Yeah, notice that "pending application" and "once"?  Nothing yet.  Oops.


Again, read the letter excerpts, it's NOT FUCKING PATENTED YET.  He's filed an application.  I hate all journalists who write about patents and other IP, they should all be lined up and shot.  None of them get it right, ever.


Again, the attorney is blowing smoke.  I question whether he's even a patent attorney, because no one with a brain who works in IP law is going to call it a "pending patent", it's a "pending application".  See above regarding "sanctionable".


Nope, anyone can use information from applications until such time as the application issues.  That's universal, not just U.S. law.  Because there may never be an issued patent, in which case why delay progress, right?  The risk, though, is that whoever uses the information might end up having to shut down production and might get sued anyway for any sales or whatever during the immediately-after-issuance period before they realize they're fucked.
Also, as I've mentioned before in previous weeks of this saga, the Europeans' application isn't currently published by the USPTO.  That most likely means that it is in the black hole of having a secrecy order issued against it.  (There is a minimal possibility that the USPTO goofed and forgot to put it in their search database.  I've run across exactly two publications that somehow got screwed up in the last 13 years.)  You can still see it on WIPO and elsewhere, but not on the USPTO's site.  When there's a secrecy order against an application, it can take literally half a century to issue.  There was one that was filed during WW2 which was issued about three years ago.  What is odd, however, is that they are not U.S. nationals and it was already published elsewhere, so a secrecy order would be pointless.  But that's bureaucracy for ya.
Anyway. That's the situation as I see it currently.  The Euros are going to have to get their little butts in gear if they want to stop Jihan.
