There's an Australia site that lets you have your pay deposited directly into the exchange and then they'll convert that to BTC for you. The fee is $1AUD too which is pretty cool.

I personally use Independent Reserve. They have 0.5% buying/selling fee with $10,000AUD/day limit once you have verified your account. You also have buy/sell limits.

Independent Reserve has 0.5% fees and they're based in AU.

Independent Reserve is also doing this

Depending where you are, there should be a number of different exchanges in your country that allow you to deposit money via bank transfer so you can buy BTC. From there you can withdraw the BTC you bought with cash to your Electrum wallet.
Different exchanges have different verification processes and fees. Localbitcoins.com is a good place to start if you want to buy BTC quickly.

GDAX is an easy way to start

There could be an alt coin that is more efficient in terms of transaction speed and costs that some large companies could favour over Bitcoin. People then jump ships and that could case BTC to slowly fall in price due to lack of demand. 
Right now, Bitcoin is the first thing people think of when the word cryptocurrency is mentioned.

So firstly, a cold wallet is stored offline (Paper wallet &amp; Hardware wallet) and a hot wallet is stored online (Electrum,  &amp; Mycelium). 
When you create a wallet with Electrum you are generated an address which is recoverable using your 12 word seed (Or up to 24 words). You enter these words into Electrum (Or any other compatible wallet) and you gain access back to your address in the event that need to access Electrum or new computer. 
Additionally you can set a password for your 12 word seed wallet so if someone did recover your seed they would also need to know the password.

A hardware wallet is the most secure. 
Other desktop/mobile wallets include Electrum, Mycelium and Bitcoin Core.

It sure sounds better saying I have 58 mBTC than 0.058btc :(

This is similar to what I saw another redditor comment.
Instead of buying those packs of smokes or eating out, use that money and buy some bitcoin. It'll add up over time and potentially be worth something in the future.

Yup! Also in AU. 
I figured if I'm spending $100 a week going out for food/drinks then I could at least cut back and spend half on Bitcoin. Alternatively you can do the same for smoking.

Well he isn't wrong lol

Yep you can use Coinbase as a wallet to store your BTC for the time being. Though the general consensus is that it's better to have a paper/hardware wallet because you don't actually own the BTC on Coinbase, you're really just borrowing them.
Well you can buy from any exchange and transfer to Coinbase but that would require a bit of searching around to figure out which is the best method. If you wanted to you could buy from Independent Reserve and use it as your wallet too rather than having to transfer to Coinbase.

You would need to transfer it to an exchange, sell then transfer the funds into your bank account.
Paypal and BTC don't work well together.
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:50:22
I buy through Independent Reserve because they have a 0.5% fee. When you withdraw your BTC to a paper wallet it's about $3USD for fees but even then that's still much better than other exchanges I've seen.

Cool theory I read on the forum, whether the name might be a sly portmanteau of four tech companies: 








My favourite theory is that he's the first time traveler from the future, gone back to the past to establish Bitcoin as the first digital currency, lol.

The general consensus on the current state of Bitcoin is that it's better to simply buy BTC and hodl rather than mining or trading when the market swings.
Mining is viable in certain scenarios e.g. free electricity, enough computing power, Venezuela
