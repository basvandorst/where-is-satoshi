it's like dynamic, interactive television. content so far only includes the playing of video games, but that is an immense beginning as there are so many millions of kids (and adults like me) who love to watch and learn while other people play our favorite games.
i sound like i work for them, but i don't. (now i REALLY sound like i work for them).
however i went on there after seeing this post and could find no option to use BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:02:36
likewise, don't know shit, followed a guide i read years ago on how to make paper wallets. never lost a satoshi. 
(actually i lost like 3000 satoshis that were sitting on mtgox which i forgot about and honestly wish they'd forget about too instead of sending me letters every 6 months updating me about their legal affairs)

am i relieved? not really. i have a couple of coins in there in case i somehow messed up when making my own offline solution. so far it seems that i didn't, but i'm a total noob who has learned everything to do with this tech from youtube videos, online guides and helpful people like you.
cheers for the hard work theymos
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:18:03
yeah right. this will just lead to people saying "i'm not tech savvy, if your exchange is secure i should be able to leave my btc there fearlessly. make it secure, stop sending me these emails"
and they kind of have a point. but we seem determined to keep trusting these stupid companies.
oh well, this is how growth happens i guess.
i'm honestly laughing this time. have exactly as much btc as i did when this was gox and not finex and a smile was definitely not on my face back then, but you get used to this after a while.

brilliant post. it's worth pointing out that bitcoin turns conventional wisdom on it's head:
"don't keep your money under the mattress, put it in a bank where it's safe"
with bitcoin you're safest keeping an encrypted version of your private key under your mattress.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:26:46

they have lost values greater than this thousands of times now. and they have lost values greater than this for the *same reason* before many times as well. 
you really do get used to it, this comes with the territory, but the sand thing is that far too many people keep leaving their funds with third parties.

why? people losing your money is why we need bitcoin, but most bitcoiners seem to be unaware of this.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:54:07
computation does not require the internet. movement of coins requires internet and signed transactions.
signing transaction is just computation, so do it on a machine with no internet.
use the signed transaction it generates on a computer with internet to broadcast transaction. computer is hacked? no problem, all they have is information you were trying to put in the blockchain.

u have to rely on the exchange splitting them for you. the shitter and more scammy the fork the less likely they are to do that.

You're still seeing this as a way to make more dollars. The ride is a lot less pleasant that way as that really isn't the point.

How do you make such a judgement? There is no practical way of making blocks larger anyway, you end up with a fork-coin....which is what bcash is....so just use that?
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:04:37
you don't exactly "give them your private key" though their software _may_ maliciously do that to you. but even if it does, you should have moved the real bitcoins away from whatever private key controlled them before the fork anyway for safetey's sake.
if you move coins after the fork on real bitcoin chain they won't move on the fake chain (probably. depends on replay prot, most coins have replay prot except 2x which isn't a thing anymore anyway).
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:16:55

bcash is worth a lot more than these other forks.
2x was the most lucrative if you were prepared to let bitfinex handle the split for you, but that's dried up now.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:00:35
yes exactly.
though i had to start twice because it's impossible to increase a hard disk size in an ubuntu virtual machine and i didn't give it enough memory initially. (so yeah check that whatever machine your doing this on has 180GB free or so.
every time i did any stuff moving files or folders around diamond would insist i restart the entire sync so get it right from the off.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:39:49
Yes but segwit means when you make blocks bigger you also add in a hell of a lot of efficiency and an actual means to scale with other methods too.
Crude blocksize increases never get adopted because they're the solution a 5 year old comes up with.
I am happy to concede that there are disadvantages to smaller blocks: they make TXs more expensive.
Can you acknowledge that there is a disadvantage to making blocks larger?

Their block explorer is fucked. Just work out where your coins where at the time of the fork and use that address/privkey.

this is nonsense.

@_date: 2018-01-05 19:55:42
well in theory if there's another fork you could have claimed that happens some time in the future (but forks at a blockheight from the same period that whatever fork client u just uploaded your private keys to) they could steal your fork coins.
no bitcoin are at risk though. also not great for blockchain analysis and privacy stuff either though.

it's easy, it just depends on if an exchange decides to create the relevant tokens.

that would require balls so large that the orbits of various celestial bodies would be impacted and cause the earth to hurl itself at the sun which would cause disruption to the bitcoin network so i'd rather this didn't happen.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:36:42
it provides a sort of collateralised testnet which would inspire more confidence in some ways than regular testnet. OTOH certain scenarios can be brought about more easily on the testnet than litecoin.

Consider the opposite scenario: you sold and watched as the bitcoin you no longer had became worth twice as much.
That is far harder to stomach imo.
It comes down to this: what do you believe in more? The USD or BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:14:23

yes but it's perhaps more complex than that, as we don't have a clear way to SF changes in right now. yes we won't use BIP9 again, but that's not to say there's a definitive alternative method.

i think what MAST offered got replaced by taproot and that that is where focus is now going. Schnorr has had a couple of bips merged and there's a few decisions left on what its final form should look like exactly and then how to go about SFing it in without incurring any segwit style drama. The obvious choice is straight UASF but there are tradeoffs in every direction iiuc. BTW this is all not very recent knowledge, things have probably moved on a lot since I last heard from a dev on these matters.

very cheap computer that uses very little electricity. therefore can run a node that's on 24/7 and that you can SSH into when you need that is pretty secure in comparison to any windows laptop you might have. also, get into the weeds of bitcoin's source code just a little bit, build it yourself, set up rpc credentials, run stuff that accesses bitcoind, like lightning etc. great fun!
oh wait, eli5 'node'? um, well i can try and define "full node" which is....um i support running these things but actually have a hard time defining it. it basically is software that interfaces with the bitcoin network, that keeps a full history of the entire blockchain. in bitcoin if you really want to verify whether something happened or didn't, there is nothing better than checking a full node that runs on software you compiled and verified yourself.

@_date: 2019-07-21 13:22:29
Ouch. But...there is a small chance that that is solvable. And tbh, I am 99% sure (but don't actually know) that coinbase won't have implemented segwit yet, which means legacy address (starting with a 1). That means coinbase TOTALLY HAVE your bcash, and...well can you search for the bitcoin address that you sent the bcash to in a bcash explorer? They are there and coinbase should pretty much have automated the process of recovering them. They are obligated to given that they support this brand-confusion based scam in the first place. Bcash should have switch formats, but one of the many unethical things they did was to not do so which has caused millions of dollars worth of either coin going to addresses on the wrong network. It's 1000x more difficult to recover if you send to a segwit address but thankfully that hasn't happened. (Segwit is awesome btw, but not if you send bcash to a P2SH segwit address lol).

i'm not sure, they haven't done an explanation for plebs like me yet.
i feel like it would cause the node to crash, so i understand the DoS part. don't understand why there'd be 2chainz tho. the attacking miner would be making his own chain, crashing the nodes that disagreed and er...is that is? the miner doing the attack literally knocks everyone else off the network and mines blocks no one would ever accept?
edit: as theymos said above me, 0.15 onward would accept the block as some semantic was changed where nodes started only looking for a UTXO's existence, not its unspentness.

no, it's not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:31:42
nice video! i'll write an explanation for you.
this is the best way to explain this:
there is a long history of currencies existing on the internet before bitcoin. no one remembers them because none of them managed to solve the double spend problem without designing the network around some centralised entity which would essentially end up being the bank.
none of these got very far because of this one unsolvable problem which satoshi managed to figure out. but that being said, blockchains don't magically fix everything. they only work in certain circumstances. a large number of nodes need to be enforcing the rules of the network to ensure that (a hopefully large and diverse group of) miners play by the rules.
without these qualities people are just reinventing the old currencies that no one remembers because they don't know their history. this is to be expected because there was no bitcoin hype to reflect light onto these otherwise tiny experiments.
in reality if any alt manages to get anywhere they will just encounter the same problems bitcoin has, but all the good devs know this and are already trying to work out long term scaling solutions like LN and they are already doing it for bitcoin.
a centralised coin will suffer the same fate as everything that happened before bitcoin. except you will have to hear about it because everyone is obsessed with bitcoin.
bitcoin wasn't the first, but it's the only one made to last. why? because it's large enough to be legitimately decentralised wrt to nodes. sure the mining side doesn't look great, but it's better than any alt and it's improving rather than getting worse.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:30:23
many people i sent a small amount to forgot their phone wallet password.
hurts me more than it does them but still sucks.
what's happened a lot recently is those people i gave $10 to now have $80 or so, and they try to send someone else $10 of their $80, and accidentally send the remaining $70 as a fee cos wallet software sucks and they have no clue what they're doing.
this has happened three times now.
@_date: 2018-09-15 22:38:56
TXs are huge making scaling even more of an issue afaict.

It is surrounded by terrible people and is being exploited (and was initially created) for political purposes sure.
But ultimately I can ignore all that stuff.
I can't ignore the fact they they **removed** segwit thus denying themselves the option of proper L2 scaling methods.
@_date: 2018-09-13 03:44:47

bitcoin is not becoming more centralised? alternatives to bitmain are finally materialising so our centralisation has perhaps peaked - at least wrt mining.
node count seems to be roughly the same.
exchanges - well i'd like to see coinbase collapse under the weight of its own stupidity which seems to only be a few months away from happening. even then, we have enough diversity there and that will also increase rather than decrease. once we had mtgox and pretty much nothing else.

unless someone actually figures out how to scale blockchains while keeping them as decentralised as possible. which is what people are doing. lots of devs. on bitcoin.

No, as adam states, everyone would like bitcoin to scale. How we go about this is not by lobbying, hardforks, secrecy and being dismissive of a collaborative process.

because that keeps the blocksize smaller and therefore more people can run full nodes. It's a tradeoff between centralising nodes and centralising blockchain access.

i don't know what else might come up.
what i do know is that all the best devs in the world like to focus on bitcoin rather than make scammy alts.
this is because they have a higher purpose than the likes of roger.
yes in theory an alt might come up with something better, but this is the internet of money.
pretty sure we could design a better internet too than the one we came up with decades ago.

@_date: 2015-06-14 08:47:49
The point is the analogy is purposefully wrong. Bitcoin will not replace banks because it's not a bank. It is creating something that has never existed that is not 'banking' but will make banking largely irrelevant. Much like the internet was never designed for the purpose of replacing the fax machine - it has a far greater utility.
@_date: 2015-12-27 13:05:52

I am a layperson, and frankly I should not be bothering the technically capable community with my thoughts. But it appears to be an appropriate compromise. 8x the potential blocksize allows for  a lot without causing as large a decrease in the number of full nodes.

Bcash isn't just an altcoin, it's a fork which means it once shared a UTXO set. It's also backed by heavy players in the industry which gives it credibility - I should say authority rather as on a technical level its credibility is a joke. The thing is held together with duct tape and I don't expect we'll be hearing anything about this coin by 2020.
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:43:12
I don't agree with increasing the blocksize from 1MB.
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:17:07
The future is sidechains, that are linked to a powerful blockchain that can exist because of bitcoin. It's all linked together but each part does what it does and shouldn't be warped drastically to try and do something it does not.
Keeping the block limit small has the benefit of forcing more transactions to use the actually anonymous lightning network. This is where I would like to see most transactions taking place. 
I don't think I need to point out the surveillance nightmare that the internet has enabled. By leaving bitcoin **as it is** transactions can (and perhaps will by default) be carried out privately and anonymously. 
Why waste this opportunity and risk so much?
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:07:05

wow. wasn't even aware of this. anyone with a brain knows at this point knows who the codes and the code-nots are. imo it's a separate issue to the "how do we scale?" question, though core are (unsurprisingly) correct in their opinion on that also.

there's no fixing the human being. the internet was a bastion of hope and now it's 99% people using facebook.
i don't see much speculation about what bitcoin will turn into, only speculation on how much a coin will be worth.
what do we think here? i see the first layer as surviving the attack from big blockers, i see mining as becoming more decentralised too, but i see everyday people using wallets that have no respect for their privacy and insisting upon KYC bullshit and bitcoin becoming very largely de-anonymised.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:01:25

can we tag some SPV wallet dudes in here for comment? i personally want to hear from mycelium
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:13:11
that is all brilliant. i am hesitant to become optimistic though. for some reason i feel like we're never going to deal with 99% of users just not understanding that they need to protect their privacy.
and ultimately, end points will store information.
everything can be private except....well amazon maybe? if you're buying a product and it's getting shipped to your address, it doesn't matter that they can't track the bitcoin transaction; every time bitcoin interfaces with the real world, a medium will be involved that is compromised.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:07:50
fair, but it's a discussion i'm pretty fed up with. i don't think larger blocks are a good idea. i haven't for a long time now, i spent from roughly may 2015 to the middle of 2016 learning what i could. and came to the conclusion that i now hold. plus the behavior and competence of BU...
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:38:19
not a good precedent imo

@_date: 2017-03-15 01:57:33
i disagree. their ability to code and their vision for scaling are separate things. i have concluded that they are wrong on both counts but they are independent of one another.
making larger blocks has always been, and will continue to be my reason for not running BU. crap code is another reason.
hopefully more people will start to question their emotional commitment to larger blocks as a result of this but anyone who thinks 1MB is now the way forward after today is building their house on sand.

It requires a lot of work keeping a database such that as many people as possible can independently maintain and verify what is in it. This work translates to reliability wrt what is contained within it. One person can maintain a ginormous, free database that can include 10m TX a minute if they like, but what is the value in that? It's just a spreadsheet. Big deal. Bitcoin is pretty much immutable - and that's why it is "hard money".

miners don't want BU it's a bluff. Jihan is not serious about running code written by cowboys. he will run it while it is not dangerous to do so to suit his goals. the longer this toxic attack continues, the slower we will scale and the more money he will make. very simple. i imagine Wu goes to bed every night stunned that there's a whole subreddit seemingly unaware of this obvious plan.
good scaling solution finally presents itself (segwit)? support the most popular alternative. obfuscate and confuse. rinse and repeat.
it's what i would do if i was Jihan (and also an asshole).

they control a large enough amount of the hashpower that it's a net gain for them if they mine an empty block, force the fees up, then mine a block which includes transactions with unnaturally high fees.

@_date: 2017-03-16 15:32:49
just realised i made a mistake too. it was summer 2013 that someone first pointed out on bitcointalk that malleability was affecting BTC withdrawals from gox. 
but you missed my point. people could withdraw btc, but if you remember, you had to pay silly fees for the transaction because gox misunderstood why their transactions weren't going through. the 0 conf transactions were actually being exploited to steal BTC from gox, who would just assume something went wrong and redo the transaction, thus slowly paying out more BTC than they had. this became a game of musical chairs that was fine for a few years because they could subsidize the thefts from fees accrued from users and from most people just leaving their stash in gox.
at the time Ver made the video, gox was already being hacked.

go back to the earliest threads on bitcointalk.org when the malleability bug was first being exploited. i can't remember the exact date but it was 2014 some time. it was largely ignored but it meant that **mtgox had less money in its system than what was showing on people's accounts**.

@_date: 2017-03-27 06:47:03
well IMO the reason this recent war was (and still is) so awful is because one side is trying to destroy the anti-fragility by compromising decentralisation. so i REALLY don't buy the "oh we're all to blame" sentiment. no. core, theymos, /bitcoin etc have all acted in accordance with the old phrase:

LMAO that just made my night.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:58:13
in that case let me explain a little more about the context you find yourself in. you have an excellent scaling solution called segwit that is currently under a PR onslaught from a team of n00bs called BU. they are so far the most effective effort against bitcoin to exist. and this is precisely because it's not so easy to tell them apart from people who have legitimate concerns.
however their concerns are well and truly debunked, and it has become tiresome and annoying to deal with constant rehashing of the same nonsense. i have wasted countless hours talking to people who have committed to a fundamental mischaracterisation of the current situation. once you take away hurt feeling and complaints about censorship (every reddit sub is moderated) then you are left with this: scaling is complex. it took a long time, but eventually a solution was presented, tested, and is now ready to be deployed. this is segwit. there are other hopeful methods on the way. BU isn't one of them. everything about it sucks. i treat it with the same contempt that i treat anyone trolling this forum about how great LEOCOIN is or something. they may be genuine in the criticism, but they have no idea what they are talking about.
edit: oh and sorry, i should have added. my instinct tells me that i am debating people who have more resources to spend all day misinterpreting my arguments than i do. it is also fairly well established that ver has deep pockets so i think it's reasonable to assume that a lot of the BU guys are professional antagonists. this doesn't make their arguments wrong, but the purpose of conversation/argumentation is to make eachother aware of more so that you might reconcile your differences. that is impossible in this case.

@_date: 2019-03-25 17:47:52
You seem really genuine and I understand where you are coming from so let me explain why I disagree:


Network effect. So many more nodes. This makes the chain far harder to attack. Bcash pushes through HF changes to the code unilaterally without contest. This is a major red flag as this should be as difficult to do as changing TCP/IP. The IPv4 mess is a sign that __everyone is using the internet and it is difficult to modify it__. In short, bcash is not "hard" money.
And put even more simply, if I have 10 coins on the bitcoin chain and 10 on Roger and Jihan's chain, I have 100000x more confidence that my coins would still be there and spendable 10 years for now on bitcoin's chain.

The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

It's not, but no size is. It's a tradeoff in either direction. Can you explain why performing the essentially impossible task of increasing it would give us the perfect size that 1MB currently isn't?

Trump is not "conservative" in any sense. He is far more disruptive in nature which is a trait found far more in liberal minds.
The irony is that what i referred to as "the left" are displaying the narrow minded behavior usually associated with right wing attitudes. Everything has been flipped on its head. 
But what I am trying to refer to (without getting too semantic) is that classical liberal values are more conducive to disrupting the status quo - i.e inventing bitcoin. And classical conservative values will be found in the mind of a person who is capable of kipping the ship afloat.

some unsafeness: slower validation giving larger mining pools an advantage. IBD (initial block download) increasing at a greater rate than bandwidth is increasing. those two reasons alone make you ask the question "are we really solving the problem by making blocks larger or are we kicking the can down the road because we haven't found a real solution?" - this ignores whether a HF to increase blocksize is possible at all which it doesn't seem to be. basically it is rational to come to the conclusion of "scale some other way." it isn't practical to carry on as we have been - treating blockspace as cheap and trivially available. scaling with layers is far more intelligent and once you use LN it clicks that bitcoin is much better suited to long term hodling and final settlement - not quick and cheap payments. trying to bundle the whole lot together is a mistake and we've realised that now. puritans who claim this isn't the "real" bitcoin don't mind making far more drastic deviations from original bitcoin from what I've seen.
looking at the size of harddrives now vs future is obviously the first "huh?" moment when this discussion comes up, but it makes a lot of sense to look deeper.

ethereum didn't fuck up. a smart contract on top of it did. this is like blaming bitcoin for gox (which gox tried to do).
the fail is them trying to fork ethereum to undo this mess, **that** is the fuck up.

ah yes of course i'm not dismissing physical private keys by any means. it's the sensible thing to do - providing you did it yourself. my only complaint here is that you walk away from the security of bitcoin when someone else has done this.
i'm sure the man who made these is trustworthy given his standing in the community, but i'm conscious of the noobs in this subreddit given our price increase and a physical bitcoin would have confused me a lot when i understood less than i do now. (spent 5 years down this rabbit whole).

private companies have research departments with money that has to be spent on something. blockchain has become a meaningless buzzword and people who are tasked with doing blockchain stuff go and do blockchain stuff.
utterly useless technology will come of all this because 99% of people are missing the point of why bitcoin needs a particular type of blockchain and why that type of blockchain is the only type worth bringing into existence.

It's difficult to achieve perfection. Hardware wallets are obviously great, but you're still reliant on certain things (as already mentioned).
The source code by bitaddress and the like I am not capable of reviewing myself, however I am capable of checking the signature and I imagine that if there was something nefarious going on with the source code the community would be aware of it fairly fast given how many people use it.
Yes airgap.
And wow regarding KenThomsonHack. The fact that bitcoins don't immediately get stolen whenever anyone makes new private keys still staggers me knowing things like this exist.

the person i was talking to does. and to some extent it does look like a ponzi scheme. it's a hard claim to refute. the most shaky element of this whole thing we're doing is based on other people continuing to recognize bitcoin's utility. but in this sense it's no more of a ponzi that any national currency is.
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:19:09
they found a few blocks since they wrote that (i think) - i don't have an ABC node and none of the block explorers are working so can't confirm this.
on each block the price plummets because that's when new Bcash hits exchanges - though for every dump someone had to buy so....maybe this thing lasts a while idk. i imagine it will die from poor development.
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:05:27
that's true for covert, he's doing overt so i believe this isn't relevant.
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:39:59
that's true, but altcoins don't have whales with coins left over from 5 years ago that they can dump.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:29:51
Yes, I'm aware of all this. I ask more out of intellectual curiosity, and also because it is actually possible to use a source of random information offline to make a private key and have no reason ever worry that an electronic device that you used was compromised.

Bitcoin is completely different in my mind to what I perceived it to be back in April.
I really didn't think we'd get this upgrade in and I thought that just meant we were stuck as a store of value and that was it. Other coins like LTC would have to do the heavy lifting.
Now I am delighted to find out that I was wrong.
But I'm even more delighted to find out that my perspective was clearly shared by others.
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:18:31
they've been inconsistent on everything else. i see no reason why this would stop them.
"while we still believe everything can be done on chain, it makes sense for us to open ourselves up to the wider community"
also, LN allows cross chain atomic swaps - nothing to do with scaling.

I don't think we'd have an overwhelming majority if we did that, and the miners would necessarily continue mining on the legacy chain because....well what other choice would they have?
I believe PoW change can be done as a soft fork meaning a bit of extra work would have to be done by miners to run their own softfork that rejects non old-style PoW blocks. They would certainly do this.

well, MtGox was slow drained I believe? (To btc-e it seems).
I am confident in the hardware wallets, it's just that I wish there was an easy way to flip a coin 256 times, tap it into the wallet myself and then use that!
It's a risk vs effort scenario. That should be easy to do, yet the best I can find is methods that involve using a 6 sided dice and javascript to convert it from base 6 to base 58. (As Greg pointed out in this post this is unreliable - yet lots of the suggestions here say to do just that).

the fact that people can't verify the code and whether or not it's spitting out really random numbers (or storing them correctly, or that someone in the company has access to them) is something you can only take on faith.
seems wrong on principle, but in practice you're probably fine. (i still wouldn't do it).

depends where your coins currently are. all i had was private keys, and there are no (working) SPV wallets for BCH **for which you can directly import a private key**
so i have to fire up an ABC full node and spent 15 hours syncing it, the second it was done I sent to an exchange that only required 2 block confirmations.

They take their purpose as a rejection of something else. A lot of people end up doing this when they unresolved issues. The currency is largely of interest to people with unchecked ego problems who interestingly tend to not be actual developers, and tend not to have the humility to listen to basically every dev who spent years saying that even if big blocks were a good idea, HFing in a contentious manner ends up with two currencies. HFs are only acceptable when they aren't contentious. Bcash was contentious to put it generously. In reality it was largely rejected by bitcoiners. They own that subreddit, bitcoin(.)com, and have a tonne of important companies like shitpay pushing their shitfork. Yet they do nothing but lose value against bitcoin. Why? Because fast, cheap online payments is the most trivial possible thing you could focus on when it comes to this monetary revolution.
@_date: 2019-08-09 00:32:20
As I said, it would help. You check the address you actually want to send to, and make sure that's what on the trezor screen.
edit: this has a large advantage over just sending from some interface on a browser. The addresses there can be changed after you press 'send' even if it looks correct upon pressing it - I would imagine anyway, though this is apparently more sophisticated than the virus OP had.

No bcash doesn't work like that. It really is a centralised database. In reality if there was a contentious transaction that they wanted to get rid of, it wouldn't result in a &gt;=51% attack, they would just HF like they always do and get rid of it a la ethereum and the DAO.

it's very rare that someone would just straight up explain a meme like this.
who are you and why haven't you been corrupted yet?
@_date: 2019-08-27 05:49:20
The product is a centralised database as a result of approaching scaling the most naive possible way. The fact that they can and do unilaterally hard fork so frequently tells you that this is not so different to a private company making their own private money. It competes for the most uninteresting aspect of this whole space - cheap fast payments. Bitcoin is about so much more than that - namely the fact that payments can never be reversed and that supply can never be increased. In bcash these are nowhere near as set in stone as so few people are involved that coercion and corruption become genuine concerns.

@_date: 2019-08-09 05:45:31
Sorry to say "actually" again, but yes, actually the point of trezor is precisely for when you can't trust the computer that it's attached to.
But wait, I think we're talking about slightly different problems. I imagined that OP was typing in, or pasting a correct address, and the virus was changing it to something else before he pressed send.
Pressing "send" on trezor would make that address show up on the trezor screen, where you would check it again the correct address and if it's the same, if you send it it 100% generates the correct transaction. 
If the problem is that OP is __copying__ an incorrect address in the first place then nothing is helped here. But I don't think that that is what is happening.

you can create bitcoin addresses completely anonymously, but getting someone to send coins to that address will in most cases require you to sacrifice your anonymity. the reason for this is that people don't send money to random places for no reason.
there are exceptions. for example you can try and mine a block yourself connecting only through the tor network. though this is essentially impossible to do now. and you can create ransomware.
but even then if you want to do anything with those coins, your going to sacrifice your anonymity again.

It's a nuanced question that there are a million answers to.
The pedantic and undeniably correct response is - if you run a bitcoin node from 8 years ago, it will connect to what we call the bitcoin network, it won't connect to the bcash network because it's not the same network. It hard forked away by breaking consensus, and thus became a different coin.

Confidential transactions. Sounds great - just like how having more blockspace sounds great. Unfortunately it degrades other essential elements of the ecosystem as far as I can tell. I need to look further in to this but verifying things becomes harder this time as the knowledge barrier becomes prohibitive, like how with a blocksize increase, the resource requirements become greater (thus sacrificing decentralization). 
From what I understand, so few people understand CT and it is so bleeding edge that almost no one will be able to verify that it is doing what it is supposed to do, while not allowing silent inflation due to bug exploitation.

That's generally true, but in this case we are talking about maintaining the integrity of the first layer so that second layers may have something robust to operate on top of. There is a reason the bitcoin chain is where serious L2 development takes place - it's the most reliable chain. A SF to decrease blocksize increases reliability.

I don't know, I think mining is going to be very different now that we've reached 7nm, and asicboost isn't screwing up the balance of things. I hope to see a re-decentralisation of mining occur.
Interestingly though, I mine, and I also run a full node, but my mining has nothing to do with my node. I mine in a pool, and I assume pretty much everyone else does, and always will. There is no advantage to running a node when mining in a pool that I know of?

I still don't think a split could happen. Either the SFers are small enough that they just get ignored and the network continues as normal, or they become sizable enough that everyone else is forced to switch over or risk wipeout. I'm not sure where the threshold is for the latter, but it's probably around 10%. UASF1 worked with about 1200 nodes. Miners pretended it was 2x but we I think it's fair to say that it wasn't.

A node is to bitcoin what a browser is to the internet. (Kind of). It's how you interact with it. It allows you to broadcast and relay transactions, download and verify the blockchain and run second layer tech like lightning.
When you use trezor, they are running the full nodes, and your transactions get sent to them and they interact with the actual network on your behalf. You are still in control of your keys with trezor which is very very important, but if you get sent bitcoin to your trezor, you are relying on them to verify weather or not the bitcoin you are receiving are genuine or not. (Very very unlikely they would lie about this, but the whole point of bitcoin is not having to trust any specific person or company).

ah, you have forgotten SF theory my friend. People continuing the 4mb chain will forever live in fear that their chain gets overtaken by the SF chain while the SFers will never have the same fear as they cannot accept 4mb blocks. This means even if 10% go with the fork and 90% don't, the 90% acting rationally will most likely have to switch over, this has a cascading effect.
I also don't expect to see this merged. BIP148 was not merged into core which imo was less controversial. (Though the vast majority of "core" were supporters of BIP148).

Chain splits don't last with SFs usually, the SF chain eats the other one. The non-updated nodes don't care because SFs don't break old rules. There is no easy way to reject a SF that just insists on have 300Kb blocks.

Centralisation of mining is partially improved by insistence on the importance on running full nodes. Miners are the only people who can reasonably be expected to always run full nodes, that doesn't mean they should be the only people who do. (edit: i should say, they are one group, there are others of course such as exchanges and wallet providers).
This is largely an issue in its own right though. We are trying to make it so that people do not have to rely on third parties wrt their money. Full nodes are the only way to achieve genuine financial sovereignty. If you use an SPV wallet then you are relying on someone else for a source of truth. And they do not have to prove their assertions the way that miners do with PoW. It can be fine of course, but it's a dangerous deviation from how this thing is designed.

RPi + 1TB HDD equals roughly $100. Having blockchain previously written to the drive makes this pretty plug and play and this (plus a very user friendly interface) is what CasaHodl is.
Once someone makes a version of this OS that you can download and save to an SD card, the kit really will just cost $90 or so.
Only issue here is that the RPi will be syncing from scratch - takes about a month, and that's getting more and more difficult to do, hence the reason we are considering the SF to smaller blocksizes in the first place.
edit: you can just use your normal computer to download the chain in a couple of days and then use that drive in the RPi. Saves you a month but more fiddling about.

Well if you transact, it means you get to rely on no one but yourself for validation. Otherwise, if no one runs nodes then your hodling is very very insecure. Full nodes are what keeps the network reliable.

@_date: 2019-02-10 06:26:45
Not trying to be preachy because telling people they "need to do the right thing and run a full node" is a waste of time and most likely counter productive.
Have I come across as judgemental in this post? We are considering pushing a SF that would lower blocksize and thus make it easier for people to run full nodes. There is no point doing this if the reason people aren't running nodes has nothing to do with blocksize. Hence my post. I'm not judging anyone, just trying to gather information.

i disagree, they are old and reliable. both have been hacked and survived which is reason to think they are in it for the longhaul. 
though i will say that bitstamp was recently sold to a different parent company. perhaps things are less reliable now. binance i do not consider particularly "safu". coinbase is not unsafe, it's just doing everything wrong morally.

ok i was there about 2 years ago. i literally had to make decision to stop. but now everyone know a _bit_ about it. and this leads to a new problem:
people always end up asking you what you do. i don't even tell them "i bitcoin" i just say i do a bit of this and that, and usually they end up asking "well how do you make money?" 
and after that i'm the "bitcoin guy at the party" because someone will here me answer the question and say "oh bitcoin you're into that?" follow by a lot of questions.
...and i can't not answer them.
it's always a trap.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:34:21
while not cheap, they are certainly still fast.
your understanding lacks any nuance.
as we have established in the last few years, it's a trade off between the security provided by decentralisation, and the ease/cheapness of use afforded by crude blocksize increases (carrying a price of centralisation of nodes and pools).
so yes, maybe the site could be updated to include some of this - it's perhaps a good idea.
however bitcoin.org a scam? that's certainly over the top.
bitcoin,com promoting bcash instead of bitcoin? that's just obviously abuse of the domain name. you may think that bcash is the real bitcoin, but even jihan himself would disagree.

@_date: 2017-11-12 16:08:22
oh man, what didn't happen?
i'll update this post later when i can be bothered
ok so first off, USD withdrawals kind of...stopped. so that meant everyone started buying BTC as fast as possible because it was clear that that would be the only way to get anything out of MtGox. this (and something called "willybot" - another of gox's many scams) caused an artificial price rally in last 2013 which preceded gox collapsing completely a few months later (after having been operating for months/years with no where near the amount of bitcoin they were supposed to have). this would cause a hellish bear market that lasted for at least a year afterwards.
let's add the fact that they were getting hacked of all their coins by people exploiting TX malleability (which gox were made aware of but didn't manage to properly work around - this meant you could withdraw your coins, the same coins, multiple times from gox. this was done repeatedly while gox just kept paying higher and higher fees wondering why their transactions kept not making it in to blocks).
then shall we mention how when they finally collapsed they blamed "a bug in bitcoin" causing yet more PR damage. (yes TX malleability is (was) a bug, but the issue was that they didn't take the KNOWN bug in to account).
ok hmmm what else? how about the massive withdrawal delays? the continuing to allow trading after bitcoin AND fiat withdrawals became impossible? this would lead to a bizarre market called "bitcoin builder" where you could trade imaginary coins and imaginary fiat - all of which would ultimately disappear in to a black hole.
now the CEO - after all the legal ceremony - a few days ago somehow gets a few hundred million dollars out of the bankruptcy?
how about when they lost all their password hashes? 
oh - and did i mention the fucking trading engine lag? i think it reached 45 minutes once (this is the amount of time it would take for your bid/ask to actually be tradeable).
yep lots of fun with that exchange. i used it to buy most of the coins that i still hodl now. i feel very lucky that i managed to not get rekt (or Gox'd as we say here. you can understand why now).
one more thing - it was basically *the only exchange in the world* - yes there were others but all of them combined barely added up to 20% of what gox handled.

Agreed that mining is (at least) a serious issue. However with the collapse of bitmain and the reaching of 7nm chips, things are moving in the right direction, unlike node count which is doing the opposite.
Central miners can also try to pull off HFs like they did with 2x. To use your analogy, they can get too big for their boots and dictate that the goose lays something other than golden eggs.

The point is coinbase can turn around and tell you your money isn't yours anymore. And you go "wtf, it's my money. damn if only there was a way to have been my own bank all along. someone should invent a system based on that. oh wait, they did and i didn't use it properly."

wow sorry. I somehow misread your post (just woke up).
but yeah, HK agreement stands for fuck all. It included an ignore-ably small number of people from "core" who nonetheless lived up to their side while some miners went ahead and started mining classic anyway.
Politics is irrelevant in this space. Everyone wants segwit apart from a guy who won't make as much money if it happens. Further analysis is completely unnecessary. 
If you don't like core's software for some esoteric reason run your own. There's a reason that the software that works isn't software that increases the blocksize.

It wasn't ignored if I recall. A solution was not found, but debate was had. Gavin opposed modifying the code, while Todd and a few others disagreed with him.

@_date: 2017-04-11 07:34:55
Well naturally, that's a zero risk power play that furthers the main goal at this point: delay progress. EB are untested and if, somehow we decided that we would scale that way rather than with SW, months of testing and convincing would have to be done. Just like BU, it is in no way designed to succeed, it is intended to confuse and delay - for which quality code is not particularly necessary. Hence endless bugs in BU.

very very difficult. software has to basically be perfect from the get go. if witness data had just been segregated to begin with we'd be flying high right now. 
but there were always going to be problems. i think we shouldn't lose heart. we managed to get bitcoin to where it is right now and if it cannot progress from here it is STILL good enough.
@_date: 2017-04-20 20:11:38
the numbers are utterly different. this pales in comparison to "willy" times. bitcoin trebled in value in about 5 days. since BFX issues began it went up maybe 20%. 
And it's not the only exchange now.
AND it's not preventing BTC withdrawal.
So yes, similar, but the numbers make it a much smaller issue.

i don't know, that's for the network to figure out. but me moving coins off my old phone that have been sitting there for 2 years to my new phone is obviously not spam.

that seems unlikely to succeed, and frankly i'm not sure that we will be in a better situation for attempting that than the situation we are currently in.
if the idea matures and the code starts to get some serious players reviewing it that will be a good sign. i was gun-ho for it a few weeks ago but /nullc's post reminded me of a few things that i had forgotten.
@_date: 2017-04-06 07:27:00
this time there's 100s of millions at stake and a massive propaganda war.
before the bUllshit was only in the mainstream media and the odd troll like stolfi. everyone that was on bitcoin's side was roughly aligned.
scaling was always the best way to try to divide the community. it's taken a long time for everyone to come around to segwit and i wasn't entirely optimistic that that would happen.
we seem to be getting on with it, but every week there's just more scandal and doubling down by these malicious entities. 
one day ver and wu (and gavin too?) will go the way of gox. and i hope we won't be fondly reminiscing over that as a result of even worse problems.

do BU? no

or you know, grassroots communities with no obvious hierarchies naturally separate into two groups which trend toward polarisation.
i wouldn't disagree with you, i feel that a certain element has been manufactured and the origin of this would logically be to suit the aims of the person sitting on top of the most obvious throne i.e Jihan and his huge pools/hashpower.
but that is not to ignore the fact that we are working as a community to undermine him.
we are undermining banks and governments, i'm sure we can include Jihan.

there's massive evidence against blockstream emerging recently, such as the revelation that they run a mining pool that has an unfair, patented advantage that they claim they aren't using (but they probably are) and they've hidden this from the public, while blocking a great update from taking place in order to protect this advantage.

Calling devs to explain this to further.
Does this take the pressure off SW for having been a block to using covert ASICboost?
If so this is huge and would presumably prevent the selfish, pragmatic side of Jihan from blocking SW.

SW being blocked most likely because it undermines an advantage being made use of by a single large entity. 
if you understand bitcoin you know that this is an untenable situation which requires action.
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:07:00
Something is wrong. The price for sure is artificially high due to there being a run on BTC within BFX. I don't think anything Gox like is happening though. Even if it was, we survived the last time it happened.

Proposing things is not what's been rushed, it's the idea of implementing things we that haven't had much testing that is worrying.
Was pretty much sold on UASF until I read this post. Was waiting for a rational voice on the other side and his reasoning far outweighs mine.
I need to remember that bitcoin works to the extent that it does and before I try to improve things I should try to maintain what it already is.

what i said 2 posts ago. other miners aren't using this optimisation because they are prevented from doing so. there's no logical reason otherwise.
@_date: 2017-04-23 03:26:54
i've spent ages debating gox/BFX similarities. i do believe the situations to have similarities, but consider BFX a more reputable company frankly, and given that BTC withdrawal is unaffected i find it plausible that the problems could be what they say they are.
the same rule of course always applies: if you aren't the sole controller of your private keys.....

well yes, but they can just accuse us of the same thing.
it's a particularly hard problem to deal with, mainly coming down to the "order of magnitude more effort to refute BUllshit than to create it" rule.
i'm trying to avoid gratuitousness and making our side look bad.
hard line to walk, because if we say nothing then they control the narrative, but we all know you shouldn't feed the trolls either.
i'm torn and just praying that bitcoin is still small enough that the people involved are mostly enthusiasts and that the community isn't diluted enough to have no connection with it's original goal of decentralisation.

@_date: 2017-04-26 20:56:32
well, let me backtrack a bit. that will give a fairly accurate price, it's just that coinbase is a nasty way to buy the coins that's all (they take a shit load of ID, tend to deny access during times of high volatility and close accounts of people doing anything they don't like). and of course, if you leave them in the exchange (which a lot of noobs do) then the exchange gets hacked...."your" coins are gone. the golden rule: if you aren't in control of the private keys, you don't have any bitcoins.
for just price checking bitcoinity.org is excellent, and you can choose the exchange you want to go by. i usually consider bitstamp's price to be the most reliable. certainly bitfinex's price is to be considered unreliable right now.

they would help us get to difficulty retarget faster though, and sacrifice their own hashrate in order to do so.
for some reason i feel like it's not going to come to this. i feel like we're just stuck with bitcoin in its current state. 
Jihan compromising and suddenly signalling segwit would set a terrible precedent tbh and i hope it doesn't happen. the point is the centralisation is undermining everything we should be hodling dear.

when one large entity turns up with metal bats and points out that there's no rule against it, and we say, let's not use metal bats and it turns out that they have fucking robot arms that only work with metal bats which they kept secret the game becomes fucking unplayable unless something is changed.
it's PoW change or the ship sinks.

They do, for the reason originally stated: if "legit" transactions incur higher fees then the favorite miner stands to gain those fees, as well as get his own fees back. A net gain.
It's a problem that gets worse as pools centralize. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 10:15:37
I think the idea is to not allow UASF to be tested on litecoin. This is the most the anti-SW people can do to delay things.

Your first statement makes no sense.
They do not "say" 95%, that is the threshold required for it to become active. That doesn't mean that if we want SW before it reaches that threshold that we can't move goalposts to make it so. That is also within the rules.
Heck the rules are whatever the majority of the players want the rules to be.
THAT'S the game.


I understand it, it's just a false assumption.

I think if they are above board (which imo is likely - maybe i'm being too optimistic) then should their banking issues get solved, they should be welcomed back by the community. BFX have been fairly consistent in the performance over the years. gox was a shit show from start to finish.
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:42:37
Mt Gox lost coins **because** of malleability. (The fact that they shouldn't have is another issue).
Bitfinex are also *not blocking BTC withdrawals while hoping to make what they've lost in commissions from the trading frenzy*
This is a lot more legit IMO.

@_date: 2017-04-27 09:30:33
If ASICboost wasn't, why should this be?
What you are perceiving as the other side of the community is a bunch of sockpuppets and shills hired by none other than Jihan, so the only fallout for them will be the tiny few who are over at /btc who temporarily fell for their lies.
The split in the community lies between the users and one huge bad actor.
This is NOT how this is supposed to work and it is the defining use-case for a UASF. 
Actions to take:
* Patch your fucking miner
* UASF to fix ASICBOOST
Then we can get back to the battle we thought we were fighting for the last 18 months: getting SW activated.

Yes, but with an unscrupulous marketing department and a bunch of scammers playing politics as opposed to actual engineers.
Read up on SegWit. This is a fantastic upgrade that engineers hit a home run with. It's in bitcoin because it's excellent. It's not in bcash because Roger Ver is an idiot and Jihan Wu wants to continue using less electricity when he mines via a patent called asicboost.
That is pretty much everything.
There are smart ways to scale or pretend ways. Making blocks larger doesn't solve the hard questions, it just delays them until later on. This is the method of a politician - they never consider things in long terms.

i'm telling you, there would have been more obstacles. and who knows? you might have sold. or lost them. or got sucked in by a fork coin.

Nice comments everyone.
First off, we don't know he has loads of bitcoins. Sure, he's been in the space for a long time, that doesn't mean he didn't have to cash out at some point given that he has a family to support.
Secondly, his work on bitcoin has been a huge part of making **you** all an insane amount of money (you know, if you hedl the whole time like you're assuming Luke was able to do). So show some Goddamned gratitude perhaps?
Bitcoin makes it easy to help other people financially so that's what I'll do.

Your villainy is defined by your disagreement with the principle of decentralisation above all else.
If, say you disagreed about what colour the bitcoin logo should be, then for example you wouldn't be a villain, but if you were to, say, actively participate in the hostile cooporate takeover attempt that is 2x then you would be a villain!

i joke, 2x is an obvious corporate takeover attempt whose outcome results in two conflicting chains - given the refusal to implement replay protection.

I think we have a pretty healthy immune system frankly. We've not only fought off attacks, but have actually managed upgrades that were being blocked. BIP148 was a very delightful surprise. (I ran a node myself but was not so optimistic - I was prepared to go down with the ship).
Bitcoin is under more attack every day, but it is also more robust every day - wrt the actual software.
Yes the community will get more and more diluted, but at the same time the code will eventually ossify (close to that point already, just hoping we can get schnorr and MAST done before that happens). 
Once ossified, bitcoin can become used for tragic purposes a la 99% of the population mainly using the internet for facebook without actually killing its utility for those that want to use it for higher purposes.

edit: Downvoted, but I think this. Yes it has actual negative qualities too but I meant what I said. Look for positive, interesting things about it - I haven't found any. It's not decentralised, its development is haphazard, and the decisions behind what happens are politically driven. None of this is interesting.

I agree. I dumped nearly all my bitcoin for bt1 and bt2 tokens and sold all the resulting bt2 tokens instantly.

I agree, and I'm seeing more nuanced suggestions about how we would actually go about "opt-in" HF to a new PoW. The idea is slowly gaining traction and I shouldn't shit on it so hard perhaps.
It does seem rather vindictive though? To brick all of bitmain's hardware, and it will have the effect of securing bcash's future as they will have nothing else to do with those miners.

@_date: 2017-09-26 15:33:21
I'm not an expert.
This sounds like a great idea though, though I think it's simpler just to use a phone wallet for small amounts. What can happen? You lose your phone and the person who finds it can't spend your coins anyway because password. And you will have recovery seed somewhere else.
Phone could be compromised but for maybe $100 worth I'd take the risk. (In fact I do, I have a small amount sitting on my android that I take everywhere. I wouldn't care if I lost it - and I won't because I have the backup seed).

Always needs mentioning: miners and pools aren't the same thing. The game theory still holds fairly tight regardless - no one who wants to not burn their own house down does anything except add to bitcoin's security.
Supposing China wanted to - for instance - rollback the chain to 100 blocks ago. Ok, hashrate goes down for a while, then suddenly a new longest, most PoW chain shows up. Double spends could potentially be a part of this, massive disruption to the network in general, but they've blown their load. Price drops a tonne, miners and pools are all pissed off. Bitcoin carries on regardless - while this sucks, it's not like there is any better alternative - everything else can be attacked the same way, and centralised solutions aren't what we're looking for. It's like with the internet - entire nations can be firewalled, have tor blocked, certain social media sites during civil unrest etc. It's far from perfect but it's good enough, and there's no better alternative.
Bare in mind what I just described is a worst case scenario too. In reality it's very unlikely to happen. There's just not enough incentive to do this because it doesn't really make any long term difference.
But you can sleep easier at night knowing that those with the kind of money/power/connections to put something like this in motion are probably just smart enough to figure out that they would benefit more from just investing in bitcoin and thus be disincentivised to attack it.
Lastly I'll point out that social attacks and straight up laws creating barriers to entry/exit are far, far more effective.

Thanks for the info. It's hard to know where to begin when people try to defend this putrid attack.
My perspective is that bitcoin is a messy, ungoverned group of cypherpunks, users, and crazy talented devs. 
There are also a few businesses with marketing departments. This means they can attempt to push bitcoin into a direction that favours them, and they can *appear to be doing so successfully* as that is how corporate communication is always perceived - they come across as heavy, collected and as having a lot of weight behind them, while bitcoin itself being just a protocol has no marketing department. So perception becomes warped.
But it means nothing in this space and businesses are just as stupid as governments when they think they can gain control over the software we all use. Even if their whole business model actually relies upon bitcoin's resilience to their hijack attempts, this doesn't mean they are capable of recognizing that fact - then throw in a couple of inflated egos such as Roger with his whole Jesus complex and anyone else with an axe to grind and those that want to pump alts and you have a community of sorts with aligned goals. But this has nothing to do with bitcoin which remains the ever nonchalant honey badger.
I am currently in love with this community. The amazing response and public acknowledgement of the emporer's nakedness has been so well articulated by so many in this sub, on slack, on twitter along with the future price of bt2 on finex being currently only a quarter of bitcoin's is hugely encouraging.
This is what happens when your governance model is zero governance.
When correct ideology manifests.

This is a terrible contradiction. I'd argue that those with a communist past that wanted to join such a place would be exactly the kind of person you'd want. They are politically aware and obviously think for themselves. They have changed their mind about an ideology they identified with for thinking better of it. This is a person capable of changing for the better and questioning closely held beliefs.

you could always have bought at a better time. don't deny yourself future gains, and protect yourself by not putting in more than you can afford to lose (this is a sliding scale of course, which no one mentions).

it's funny because once we got segwit luke was encouraging everyone to stop using it as it was putting more pressure on nodes given the invisible blocksize increase that accompanied it.
Luke would have been more content if it had taken until one month from now to actually get segwit.

BCH is a massive social attack, literally described as such by initial big blockers like gavin, mike, roger etc. That caused an unbelievable amount of disruption. I was sure we were fucked during the final onslaught - segwit2x but we survived basically thanks to bitfinex. That was a worrying time but we have what we need to scale now thank god. We can ossify without TX mallaebility.
No other attack has been anything like as disruptive, and 51-100% attacks remain theoretical (within bitcoin at least) it seems.
Exhaustion of the entire community fighting off big blockers was very demotivating and sowing discontent in a progressive movement is a time honoured method by the powerful to drain energy. Fortunately the actual attack basically became a dividend to all those who took the time to understand bitcoin scaling at a nuanced level and offered us a very real financial reward for having done so - tonnes of big block forks all with a market value that transferred money from clueless noobs to the pockets of those with a better understanding.

All nodes can validate transactions. And the node's are the backbone of the network. It's silly to dismiss the value they have.
Yes some nodes are more economically significant than others, but those ones are only kept honest by the sheer volume of lesser nodes.
It's a very sorry state of affairs if only large companies have nodes. Collusion would become inevitable.

it's advice from the veterans. it's less relevant now because the custodians used by people such as coinbase, bitstamp etc are more trustworthy than the likes of MtGox, but the point of bitcoin is that you don't need a custodian.

Everyone that would like UASF to happen is well aware of this (I hope).
But with a change of this nature, nodes comes first. Then small business, then large businesses. If ~5% of miners come on board then the legacy chain becomes a dangerous place to be.

I think we can agree that currently, anyone running 148 is doing so voluntarily. Should they (or we - disclaimer: I am pro 148) reach critical mass (let's say 20%) and others become fearful and switch chains due to reorg concerns then your point would be that this is not a "decision" it's somehow coercion? 
Yes technically you're correct, but how else are changes supposed to happen? Kek's point remains valid that it couldn't be more user activated.

It burns a little that the fee market is artificially high because we could have scaled somewhat by now if it wasn't for the ass-hat miners stopping us. (Who are now making more in fees than they might have so the motivation for the blockade makes sense).

The authority is the 95% of the users who run core software.
The reason for the blockade is that miners are required for activation, but they will not allow it because:

Banks losing my money doesn't worry me at all. If they do, it's their fault. This is a little flippant I will grant you, but it's better than any of my other options. Bank transactions are reversible. Bitcoin is a dumb technology as beautifully pointed out by the wonderful Andreas Antonopononounulpos. That forces the intelligence out to the edges.

That means tolerating sky rocketing fees in order to maintain a status quo that benefits miners who can continue to benefit from (genuinely) unnecessarily high fees, and who can engage in the anti-competitive practice of ASICboost usage.

i.e town planners decide to route one highway off the edge of a cliff, a bunch of people drive off and your conclusion is "that's what the drivers want."
i feel like an r/btc troll coming up with an analogy like that, i don't mean to sound condescending here, I just really hope you can see why segwit not activating due to core's mistaken method of deployment does not mean the network doesn't want segwit.

The correct chain is a matter of opinion. I will personally be using 148 because I support UASF. this chain also does not run the risk of getting replaced by the other chain. the "legacy" chain will (the one that isn't BIP 148).
The more traction BIP148 gains, the more likely any transactions done on the legacy chain are to be erased.
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:51:42

High transaction fees are an increasing factor in blocking segwit also.

Temporary disruption, then back to where we are now. The greater the disruption, the more likely we are to actually just *gasp* scale bitcoin.

ok i'll bite
first, there ARE hundreds of trolls.
second, anyone at this point that ignores the problems that larger blocks cause must be trolling. i haven't even stated my opinion, and you say i'm in the minority?
as always, if you want larger blocks RIGHT NOW then go change the code and run a node that allows for that. 
(for the record, i think 2mb blocks would probably be fine. it's not a black and white issue though and people here get so VOTE HILLARY/VOTE TRUMP about everything)

This is pretty unethical but at the same time if it crashes the legacy chain and therefore helps get SW into bitcoin there's good reason to do it.

Yes I agree. I spent most of 2015 unsure about the path forward. But the insufferable nature of what happened from 2016 onward can be put down to a few hostile actors. 
It is not reflective of "the debate" or somehow enlightening to bring into consideration the "silo effect" that polarizes people in situations where deeply held opinions are contradicted which causes emotional and defensive behavior. In this instance this behavior is entirely justified given. The decentralized nature of bitcoin is something I am emotionally attached to - perhaps unhealthily - but also for good reason. When an important project I've devoted years of my life to is under attack I'm going to defend it. I'm not the type of person who will sit there and calmly say "Oh well, if it fails it fails." 
Be as passive as you like/as the Oatmeal suggests.

it is something like 10^60 times more likely to be a fault of blockchain.info than a result of a genuine generation of a previously used private key.

miners will never fork anyway. they bluff support for "alternatives" (see BU, bitcoin classic, BarryCon etc) to stall whatever the most popular scaling method is to continue creaming it in while the network attempts to chug along.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:31:35
but...it is a soft fork. that's *literally what it is* that's why people on the legacy chain have to be careful. if it was a hardfork everyone could just ignore UASF if they didn't want anything to do with it.

buying bitcoin in the UK has always been a pain. though bitstamp has been around a while now and made it fairly easy. but not for orders this large.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:59:03
There's no way it can be a):
1. They commit to a timeline that cannot possibly be honored.
2. They mistakenly assume that an agreement between a few high up folks in the world of bitcoin business = consensus among a few million users.
3. The proposal - even if they could get the code together in 4 months (lol? entire new SW from ground up **and** a hardfork?) is actually pushing something we **still don't want** i.e 2MB blocks - (read back to point 2, there **isn't consensus).
Option b) it is then.

Yes true, but I'm not about to write a novel. The are many in this space who believe institutions like the NHS to be inherently evil.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:20:30
There are no technical details at all (for good reason). My hunch would be that it would allow AsicBoost, but even if it didn't, it's not "vanilla segwit" for many reasons, the most significant one being that it's on a different bit, so has to be completely rewritten and tested from the ground up.
it's just more delaying tactics coming to your straight from guys in suits who still haven't adjusted to not having unilateral control over the space they operate in. (indeed, they have no power to enforce this unwritten, untested, empty promise that will serve to do nothing but delay segwit for more months/years).
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:33:34
All that's happened is a bunch of people in suits have shaken hands. A few hundred people (at best) does not equal consensus of a few million users. That is a bizarre fantasy.
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:50:40

There are other more subtle qualities to bitcoin.
The best devs in the business.
The most under attack and therefore, presumably the most robust.
The highest hashrate (though to be honest that is not as good as it looks due such a large amount being under the control of a small group of people).
And plenty more if you'd like to develop some nuance to your opinions :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:26:57
You are confused wrt a few things.


Unclear what that is. Do you mean the increasingly risky legacy chain?


Exchanges have nothing to lose by offering temporary economic options to those on the BIP-148 fork.
Ah, now I'm starting to see where you're coming from :D


You mean like like bittylicious? They seem to understand a lot more than you think. If you are a customer of their and are concerned I suggest you tell them what it is you think they don't realize.


Even if this is the only way to get SW? Also, what do you call what Jihan is doing if not "strong arming"?
Well if you would rather have rule by a few CEOs and pool operators be my guest. Though I suggest that bitcoin is not an appropriate project for you to be a part of because it can't operate that way.




To combat BIP-148 run a full node because nodes are unreliable at indicating what users want? That is incoherent.
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:05:15
Yep. That all looked like politics rather than crypto-anarchy to me.

@_date: 2017-07-12 15:49:37
it's nice when you state the subtle strawman that /btc adheres to so explicitly so I can refute it directly:
Activating upgrades through softforks is how it's supposed to work, and how it always worked until a new, potentially expediting method was tried: BIP9, which allows miners to suddenly veto upgrades. This was the first and last time this would ever be used because this gave miners political power that should not, and did not exist in the original design. 
If you are genuine in your statement then you are just failing to realise that PoW is how we trust that transactions are in a certain order, not how we decide on network upgrades.

buying now into what may get dumped back into the 400s would lose you more than you'd save by hedging again the pound potentially falling. maybe that would lose 10% of its value, even 20% in a nightmare scenario.
what would that be? BTC=$430?
not really a sensible hedge.

well, not really, it leaves a sour taste but it gets us segwit.
and no, we have already failed this activation period, but the next one may very well activate BIP91 - that's the one that starts in - now only 26 blocks! (and we have to get 80% of the 336 blocks that follow that signalling BIP91 or it will fail to lock in).

The tragedy is that people jumped in without understanding what they were getting themselves into. Email is a great system, however GMAIL is a terrible product because it masquerades as being free, when the reality is that it steals from you whilst offering you a trivial service in return.
Bitcoin is difficult to use for most people. I'm relatively tech-savvy and it honestly took me a few years before I found a satisfactory solution to keeping my coins safe.
I had to get familiar with linux, be able to boot it off a usb stick, get a driver for a dumb printer, copy html code from bitaddress.org and open it in an offline firefox, generate a wallet, print it off, LAMINATE IT (there's that guy who lost his coins because of spilling liquid on his wallet) and then.....well then it's about physical security, not digital.
All done away from a window I might add....on battery operated devices (ok that's being insanely paranoid, but still.)
Most people will not approach anything like this level of sophistication. Just like most people can't maintain their own email server. It's a pain in the ass, and just something that people are unlikely to ever understand the need for.
They WILL become bitcoiners, just like they all got email addresses, but we REALLY need to try and avoid a serious problem that happens with wide scale adoption of a decentralised system: predatory middle men who capitalise on the general public's inability to cope without them.
The mtgoxs and gmails need to stop happening.
In summary: when engineers design the future, they do a brilliant job, but it's way beyond the rest of the population. They will use it because they have to, but they will use it in a very ignorant manner.

This is true for everyone, not just you. It is all but guaranteed that no other effort to bring SW into bitcoin will get anywhere near as far as UASF has already got.
Thank you for having principles.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:24:52
yes, and the idea was that those interests would align.
now they do not, and if we don't UASF, the miner's interests will continue to dominate those of the users.
what we are doing is consistent with what you say, and we are making the miners interests change: if you want to mine on a chain that doesn't run the risk of disappearing at some future date, better get on board.

You can download a binary of that. Signed by (I think) Andrew. Only reason to not use this in lieu of an "official" core release is if you were contractually obliged to only use the latter.
Bare in mind Peter Todd, and Greg - who was outspoken against BIP148 - are now advising that it is safer to run BIP148 than a normal core node. You have a smaller chance of getting re-orged _and_ you lessen the chance of network disruption from miners playing power games.
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:15:48
Miners only capitulated to our desire for segwit because we gave them an ultimatum: "If you don't start signalling segwit to the extent where it will lock in, we will cause a massive amount of disruption."
So they said "ok". While pretending that they were the ones who decided of their own volition to activate segwit. 
"You can't fire me, I quit"
Now they are actually ahead of where our planned chaos was to begin (one week's time), but people are relaxing and perhaps becoming complacent, when in fact the fears people had over joining us are **less and less valid with every new node that joins us.**
Advice? If you run a full node, make sure it's running BIP148.
Good luck friend.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:25:34
if you send coins created before Aug1st, the transaction will be included in both blockchains and can continue to move around on both chains. splitting your coins only happens if you mix a _newly mined_ coin in with one of your transactions, then one chain won't recognize the transaction. this could of course happen unintentionally, and conversely, some people will be trying to get hold of new coins mined by a BIP148 miner just so that they can commit their coins to one side of the fork.


if the coins were mined before the Aug1st split then both wallets will see them at the new address. it wouldn't matter which wallet you used. (there's exceptions, like if you paid a low fee and somehow your transaction never made it into the legacy chain but did make it in to the 148 chain etc).

It's nowhere near as bad as you say. Scaling is just delayed because we have to wait until the end of BIP141. I feel as doom-and-gloomy as you some days, but really, the whole thing will probably be fine.

At the moment miners are signalling bit4 which is undefined in core software, but it is not something to be concerned about. (It was the miners signalling BIP91 which has now activated and no longer needs to be signaled. Nonetheless, many haven't bothered to flip bit4 back yet.)

@_date: 2017-05-23 17:56:12
Those coins are safe, nothing changes wrt to the fact that you are the only one who knows your private key, therefore no one can steal your coins, or undo the transactions in which you acquired your coins.
There are other things to perhaps consider regarding potential disruption in the market place, perhaps the price plummets, perhaps we get SW cleanly and the price rallies.
Also, in the event of a temporary chain split it's possible that you will (temporarily) be in a situation where you have your coins on both chains. If exchanges start making allowances for this, you can sell on one of the chains. (If 148 was anything above 10% hashrate I would not hesitate to do this, because it's likely that the transaction would disappear for what ever unlucky soul bought them once the 148 chain got longer than the legacy chain).
edit: to clarify, I consider this pretty unethical, I would not do this myself, but the fact that it can be done means people need to be wary of it.

There are also other options, such as running core modified to enforce BIP91 (segsignal).

here is an excellent guide 
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:43:25
bitcoin can always fork. it just means people either make a new rule, or get rid of an old rule. which means there are two sets of rules which means two bitcoins. in a softfork a rule is added, this means the forked chain doesn't break the old chain's rules. **this** means the if the forked chain ever gets longer than the "legacy" chain it will automatically be accepted by everyone, not just the forkers. 
in a hard fork a rule is taken away, this means 2 bitcoins will most likely continue to exist forever a la ethereum/ethereum classic.
Aug 1st is a necessary date because it gives the community enough time to upgrade to BIP148 while not leaving it too late to mine enough blocks before BIP141 expires in later in the year.
Predicting forks is predicting that someone, somewhere will start running a version of bitcoin that either adds a new rule or gets rid of an existing rule. Then predicting if any, and how many other people in the community will go along with it. i.e pretty difficult to do. however a softfork that enforces something as popular as segwit is very likely to overwhelm the legacy chain. I certainly hope so anyway.
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:10:29
but if they stop signalling segwit, they won't get orphaned until Aug1st (unless some people are actually running BIP91).
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:11:36

hmm, I'm curious, in what way has blockstream ever influenced bitcoin's source code?
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:40:19
There are many reasons why mining needs to be decentralised.
Yes you have a point when you say users and nodes are replaceable while hashpower isn't, that **doesn't** mean that hashers can decide a hardfork is going to happen. If they could, we'd (or rather **they**) would have larger blocks by now. But guess what? They need users to come with them and they have no way of forcing that to happen.
The miners could potentially force through a **soft** fork if the wanted, but not a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:28:05
this guy counts
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:49:00
BIP149 would redeploy segwit after it would have expired in November, but instead of expiring like BIP141, it would just activate after a certain date, but this would have been way into 2018. There were pros and cons. I chose to go nuclear with BIP148.

Yes exactly. My point is that if you can use the things I mentioned, then bitcoin isn't practical for a lot of things (though it is vastly preferable as a store of value to even Europeans and Americans).
And yes, Argentinians have horrible things going on with their currency. Again, maybe it remains a little unpractical but it's vastly preferable to losing vast amounts of wealth in tiny spaces of time for merely not spending your cash fast enough.

Of course I'd believe evidence. In this space it's very easy to prove certain things. You're making a very silly assumption in saying that I would refuse to believe actual evidence.

A man called Jihan Wu has a large amount of hashrate under his control which he is using to veto an upgrade the network wants.

I'm running 148. It's impossible to coordinate anything better than that, and it still does a lot to enforce miners behaving. They will get slapped, but there will be a week or so in which they can cause chaos if they so desire. 
This is vastly preferable to them just ignoring BIP91 and going back to mining BUllshit or whatever.

If you have your coins safe in cold storage that's totally reasonable.
(Just to point out, segwit HF momentum was never a real thing. "Consensus" between some businessmen and some pathological miners is not the same as having code that anyone would ever use. Indeed, they have nothing except a deadline which everyone who *can* write code says is laughably unrealistic.)

right? spent longer than i'd like to admit arguing with this troll yesterday.
to answer u/carrudi 's question, segwit is effectively being blocked by one company (antpool). this is ultimately the fault of core for using BIP9 to roll out segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:08:02
There is no way of knowing if any miner is running BIP91. They have merely mined 80% of blocks with bit4 flipped for one period to make it lock in. That doesn't mean they're actually running it. And yes, they can signal bit4 without running BIP91.
If the miners had nothing against BIP91, then they would likely have had nothing against BIP141 (the actual BIP for segwit). They had to be forced by UASF - BIP148.

BIP148 means non-segwit blocks get orphaned after Aug1st. This gives non-zero incentive for miners to mine segwit blocks or risk wasting their work. The greater the amount of nodes, the more incentive.
BIP91 means this too, but that's for miners only. And the more of them there are (signalling BIP91), the more incentive other miners have to also do that.

yes, in that most people "support" whatever is in core software. which means if core just merged 148 we'd have segwit on Aug15th.
yes, it's a little more nuanced than that (perhaps these core users only support segwit in the event that it is activated by miners - which it 100% won't be without further feet up backsides) and so on...

there is always the ethic "it's the code itself that matters, not who wrote it" indeed, this is sort of the principle behind the entire project given satoshi's continued anonymity, **however** jeff's code also seems to be a pile of steaming feces so.....

BIP91 was made for 2x, but it can be combined with normal core software in much the same way as BIP148. Someone has already posted links for doing this, but it's only really miners that need to run this. Users can just run core (though, preferably they'd run 148 so as not let the miners off the hook until segwit is activated).

If the network would have forked to BU, the network would have crashed and burned as you are presumably well aware.
Miners aren't suicidal, they run code that works (core) and then pretend that it's BU they're running. They do this for political reasons.

Segwit at fault because an arbitrary private fork of bitcoin can fuck with it? What?
I can see your point in the rest of your post though. I however think it's a lot more justified given that bitmain's fork is something they are on their own with (it's not even NYA style consensus) whereas UASF has a lot of devs and nodes - who are indeed trying to force through a feature that most passive users of bitcoin have wanted for a long time - as well as ~45% of the hashrate.

@_date: 2017-07-17 12:06:49
apparently their effort in spreading the hashrate around to make it look like they didn't have so much was temporarily undermined? or are they trying to overstate their power now as much as possible?
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:10:44
segwit threshold is 95% and until we have any reason to believe miners are actually going to enforce BIP91 (BTC.com just stopped), when you take into account the fact that **zero users** are going to enforce it, we are back to needing the 95% threshold for plain old vanilla segwit.
I mean, ultimately I'm happy if the whole 2x bullshit just disappears and we get it the non gaffer tape way, but this means a very nervous 2 weeks once again.

Well if you read what I said:
"(Miners have) the power to not put transactions in any blocks at all"
Miners currently have the power to block BIP141 because of how it was deployed. Do you want to debate weather or not that is true? Or do you think the other jobs they do (listed in my previous response) = "control bitcoin"?

I'm not sure. Shaolinfry wrote the BIP which initially had a later deadline. It then got brought forward to Aug1st because that gives more time to lock in segwit in the event that we only have 15% of the current hashrate come with us.
It was probably Shaolinfry who did this, but I don't actually know. I believe a few different people were pushing for this. Some complained, but we managed to agree thus avoiding there being two BIP148s :P

No. If they did I'm not sure what difference it would have made? At best perhaps an (unenforceable) agreement that is more technically feasible? (i.e HF in a year rather than before current SW expires making Barrycon essentially impossible).

I don't think it is personally. If a few large miners turned on 141 today the price would surge. Currently it looks as though any scaling might be impossible, in which case I would hope the market reflects that rather than live in a fantasy.

Segwit means bitcoin can do way more transactions.
Segwit2x is a weird effort to get miners to stop blocking the regular segwit.
UASF is users tired of miners blocking segwit and saying that come Aug1st they will ignore blocks by miners who don't start using segwit.
BIP148 is the code for UASF.
ASIC is hardware used for mining.
Bitmain is the company that makes the majority of ASICS.
BU is crap software that no one who takes bitcoin seriously runs.
Blockstream is a company that employs a few core devs. It is the focus of conspiracy theories enjoyed by nutcases who usually also support BU.
Jihan Wu runs a huge mining pool (or 3) and refuses to signal segwit.

they are merely writing into the blocks they find that they **intend** to signal segwit2x on bit4 in the future. this is in no way binding and is no more significant than them tweeting "segwit2x bruh!"
until pools start flipping bit4 (**real** signalling) nothing has happened.
edit: you can check by looking at any [blocks they mine](
as you can see where it says "version" it says 0x20000000. this means they are signalling nothing.
bixin however are [signalling the real segwit]( as you can see by 0x20000002. segwit2x signalling looking like this: 0x20000016. and signalling segwit **and** segwit2x (i believe) looks like this 0x20000018.
at the moment you have people confusingly referring to no-consequence messages being written into blocks as "signalling."
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:43:41
nope. they have made only symbolic gestures while doing precisely nothing with regard to actually making segwit more likely to happen.
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:59:33
Amir gets it.
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:57:14
There are other reasons that are more nuanced.
1. He currently has an advantage over other miners called "ASICboost" which he loses if segwit happens.
2. There is a political power grab going on to try and take software development away from bitcoin core. In reality people use core because it's the only software without fatal bugs in it. BIP148 is an exception because core (collectively) refuse to take part in this particular UASF. However, the software has still been reviewed and approved by 3 core devs and so far has performed reliably.

great question! absolutely, those 24 words are in accordance with bitcoin's standards, specifically BIP39. there is nothing specific to the ledger about them. it has to be this way, otherwise no one would ever in their right mind buy one of these products for precisely the reason you mention.
just to be clear, there are different derivation paths. so if your scenario were to occur, it's possible that your heart would stop for a brief moment where you were told that your 24 words were "invalid" only for you to have to select a different derivation path to get it working properly. ledgers and trezors may very well use different derivation paths, on trezors it depends on whether you are generating segwit addresses or legacy addresses. this doesn't really matter, the point is the word generation is universal, not proprietary nonsense.

@_date: 2017-06-10 00:09:53
Well there's nothing to approve really given that nothing really exists yet.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:30:04
Yup. Though it of course validates those who said the timeline was unrealistic.
I will continue praying for SW to become active in ~6 weeks.

They aren't signalling it. They are pretending that they will signal it in the future.

Or so the case may have seemed, but one day, among the noises and the groaning of the umpteenth protest, slinging shit at the wall hoping some would stick, a guy sat at a booth, handing out flyers. An old fossil stood above him saying: "It'll never work, the government will shut it down." "They can't" responded the man, "It works the same way the internet works." The old man shook his head, frowning at the piece of paper. "They'll shut it down" he said again. 
At the sight of this, their life was changed for ever. A short trip home (i.e anywhere with 4 walls, a laptop and wifi) and a small amount of investigating turned into a 5 year journey. Some shit was finally sticking: the world had hope again.

ah but how fleeting our friendship was. as wild as our passion may have been, we both knew it would be a temporary situation.
cos u know, $2600 came...like an hour later.

i do see aug 1st as a chance to make some free money. though i'm not sure how to take advantage just yet tbh.
i'd be happy if we just transition smoothly.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:47:15
I do.
Do you realize that there is no way in hell that working code will meet those deadlines?

I am a fool who will be accepting payment on UASF. No way I'd rely on legacy chain (that would violate my principles and sense)
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:28:46
It's available as a tested, signed binary (you can find it if you ask in the UASF slack). Core won't merge it, and I can understand why. 
That said you should **definitely** run it if you ever want to segwit to happen.

why buy bitcoin when you can buy something that promises to track the price of bitcoin?

You assumed correctly.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:19:08


you mean the thing that literally zero core devs want?

So do other, untested, unwritten, un-agreed upon potentially perfect ideas.

Great summary. Thanks!

Thank you kindly!

No it doesn't. Bitpay didn't write it but very few wallets support it - for good reason.

lol Civic tells me you listen to idiots like Vinny Lingham.
Blockchains don't solve the identity problem.
Read Nick Szabo, get a clue.
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:16:52
erm ok.
core devs want _segwit_
core devs don't want miners running a poorly written and basically untested bunch of software thrown together quickly, even if it meant just getting segwit, but it also means getting lar....
why am I even bothering?

Assuming OP meant BIP 141/BIP9.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:27:58
"sides" fallacy.
you have everyone
then you have bitmain.
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:10:05
something like that.
@_date: 2016-07-10 22:18:33
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:21:24
BIP9 was such a stupid idea :(

Equal rights are what gay people already have everywhere I have ever lived.
Positive discrimination is _preferential treatment_. If you ever argue for _downtrodden group_ having more of _x_ you in the same playing field as someone saying _downtrodden group_ should have less _x_.
It's a stupid game, and you know what kind of prizes those yield.
edit: for god's sake, why can't we agree on this? i agree with what you are defining as fascistic. resisting that is admirable. doing the OPPOSITE is NOT.

To probably no end. (Maybe it has the function of taking steam out of BIP148s sails). idk

I would also recommend trezor and that's an excellent point, 100% buy from the manufacturer!

at best, he's an idiot who got rich somehow.
it's most likely dishonesty at this point though, he has never once acknowledged the trade-offs that come with making blocks larger. i tried to speak to him in 2015 about this to no avail. i gave up assuming good intentions in 2016.
