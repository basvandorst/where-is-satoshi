I don't know where you get the 'facts' you've stated above, but many of them are simply false, if not inaccurate.
Of the many board members the BF has had, only two have been arrested: Charlie Shrem and Mark Karpeles. Each were arrested for their own personal actions and not BF actions. There have been &gt; 15 separate board members over the 3 terms. Saying 2/15+ is "many" is simply inaccurate... and besides. These people no longer serve on the board. Nobody on the current board has been involved with any bitcoin scams/crimes.
You claim you didn't like sweeping statements that accuse astronauts, social security clerks, janitors as being murderers by virtue of having a government job...
yet you make sweeping statements of your own and claim all 2000+ members of the Bitcoin Foundation are wingnuts, all board members are kooks/scammers.
You say you see the Bitcoin Foundation as representing some extremist political agenda that you don't agree with. I'm not sure how you see the BF representing ANY political agenda because it tries hard to NOT get involved in politics and to stick to its mandate: development, education, and technology.
 
You talk about the Bitcoin Foundation doing policy work. That is not in the BF's mandate. Their mandate is fostering more developers in the bitcoin ecosystem, educating the masses about bitcoin, and encouraging technical solutions over regulatory solutions wherever possible.
Coin Center's mandate is US policy.
I understand you have an apparent hatred and/or negative impression on what you *THINK* the Bitcoin Foundation is, but the more you type the more clear it is that you don't even know what the Bitcoin Foundation *actually* is/does.
By way of example, it's like me getting mad at Microsoft because of all of the puppies I "see" them kill. Sure, it's my choice to be mad at them for that, but saying they've killed puppies doesn't mean they've actually killed any, and my anger really serves no bearing in reality (and makes me seem like a wing-nut because I'm spouting ignorant and unsubstantiated claims).
You're welcome to continue to "see the Foundation as representing some extremist political agenda that you don't agree with" but if you one day choose to base your opinions on facts instead of conjecture, you'll sound a lot less like a wing-nut yourself.

Yes the old guard at The Bitcoin Foundation weren't the best, but they did get a lot of things done.
A risk assessment for Bitcoin was a GREAT initiative that the old guard did.
The new guard held DEVCORE events to train new developers. They also supported the Blockchain Training Conference that educated hundreds of attendees about bitcoin including banks, audit firms, lawyers, accountants, and a variety of public servants.
Your assertion that the Foundation is "a collection of kooks and scammers" is a sweeping statement that is provably false... just like me saying "All humans are murderers because that one guy killed another guy." You can't blame a group of people for the actions of one.
I'm not downplaying the good work that Coin Center has done in the United States. They also have done good work alongside the Bitcoin Foundation's work in the US, Canada, and abroad.
@_date: 2016-08-18 04:45:44
I can't yet speak about the specifics of an ongoing Investigation. I know - it's always lame to hear that - but it's true. 
What I can say is that in general, every cyber attack has multiple actions that result in the final goal. 
There's the initial breach or attack vector. 
There are usually 0-n escalation actions that grant the attacker more access than was gained in the initial breach, or prepare the environment for future action
And there is the final action that accomplishes the goal. 
It's possible to know details about one or more actions without knowing details of others. As a result, it's also possible to implement controls to mitigate the known actions too.
@_date: 2016-08-20 15:52:59
Yup. 
Miners are just bank tellers who process our cheques for us and update the banking ledger. But instead of being paid by the bank that owns the ledger, miners are allowed to create small amounts of coins for themselves as a reward for their bank teller work.

@_date: 2016-04-23 17:41:38
Correct. No system is 100% secure. It's a theoretical impossibility to have 100% security. 
There are many risks that bitcoin manages, but some risks it does not. 
I've spoken about this in many of my talks; I can share the slides when I get home or you can look them up on YouTube yourself. 
Even if you use the most secure hardware and the most secure software in the world, it's still possible to write your password on a sticky note and stick it on your monitor. 
An information system is made up of many more components than just the tech: policies, procedures, and trained staff to carry out the system's functions. All must be equally secure like a chain; of one is weak, the system is weak.
ShapeShift implemented many new technical  controls in its hardware and software, but also implemented new policies, procedures, and I personally trained their staff. They are now significantly more secure than they were before but it's impossible for anyone to reach 100% security. It's a law of information sciences that's similar to trying to reach the speed of light or reach absolute zero. The closer you approach the limit, the harder it is to get even closer.

It absolutely was not an operation to expose data for laundering charges (what data? ShapeShift keeps no user data), nor did it have anything to do with the Panama Papers.
Erik is a smart business man, but frankly he doesn't have the technical knowhow to orchestrate the hacks, the drama background to script the reactions of his staff, the planning skills to predict what I would do upon calling me in as an independent investigator and having me poke around their infrastructure and interviewing his staff completely unscripted... and all of that to magically have the events unfold exactly how he'd like them for "PR purposes" or to "expose data for laundering"
I know conspiracy theorists like to theorize, but sometimes you get exactly what the label says on the tin. This was an inside job carried out by a former employee whose bitcoin addresses are now under such severe scrutiny by the global bitcoin community that he'll have an incredibly hard time liquidating them.
Stop your folly. It's tiresome.

@_date: 2016-04-23 17:31:11
I'm sorry, but you're incorrect. 
All security solutions have "security leaks" - which I assume means unmanaged risks. 
The study of security is the study of information sciences, and one of its core principles is risk management. Security is not a binary state, it's a gradient composed of how many risks are adequately managed. 
Solutions that are "secure enough" manage most risks, whereas less secure solutions manage few risks. 
It is theoretically impossible to manage ALL risks.

The US Government? That's fine - they're not a US company  and already block New York users from using the exchange.

FWIW, The Pirate's Bay has been a centralized site since it began and has been chased _aggressively_ by multiple governments for years, yet it's still up.
I don't see this as a problem for ShapeShift.
(Disclaimer: my opinions are my own and do not represent ShapeShift)
@_date: 2016-04-23 17:12:34
By that reasoning, NOBODY can claim they "are secure."
Security is not a binary yes or no proposition. It's a gradient of many shades of gray where most risks are handled but other risks aren't. 
I agree with you that "ShapeShift is not completely secure" because it's *theoretically* impossible to be completely secure let alone practically impossible. 
I do know this, though. ShapeShift is SIGNIFICANTLY more secure now than it was before, and their roadmap for the rest of 2016 will only increase their security even more. 
@_date: 2016-04-18 21:47:33
Every production server should record logs to help in the event of an investigation. The specifics of what to record is largely up to the business case.
At minimum I would recommend logging the launch of every process (i.e. execve) and log changes to files that should not be changed without admin intervention (i.e. operating system files, source code, etc.)
Each server should be configured separately based on what its role is for your business.
@_date: 2016-04-26 01:10:56


ShapeShift does not process withdrawals. Users can't even request withdrawals. 
I'm all for asking questions to seek clarity on a few unclear points - especially when (as was stated up-front) some details were purposely removed for security reasons - but you should stick to asking questions rather than imagining how ShapeShift works under the hood. 


If your imagination lead you to this conclusion, who are we to hold you back? If you ever decide to look at facts instead, they're right here on the floor where you left them.

C4 did not demand 54 satoshis from OP. We don't do this for the precise reason you mentioned: received bitcoins require fees to spend.
In cases like this, C4 always comps the outstanding $0.01 amount so that the user is able to take the examination immediately. 
It seems that in this particular case, the user wasn't willing to wait a couple of hours for resolution, so took to to complain about Bitcoin's fees instead.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:06:41
Hello! My name is Michael Perklin, and I currently serve as President of C4.
First, I'm sorry that you've been inconvenienced by this issue. It's quite common for payment processors (including C4, BitPay, and others) to use fiat values for payments and ask for the BTC equivalent at time of sale. The BTC equivalent is calculated at the time of payment, and continually updates every ~5 minutes to keep up with the ever-changing price of BTC. As a result of this, a payment sent at the end of this 5min window could be received at the beginning of the next 5min window which uses a different price. This is what has happened here, and why your incoming payment appeared to be $0.01 off.
Next, I've checked our system and while I can find your email asking for assistance, I do not see any replies from any C4 staffmember who responded or demanded anything of you. (Your email was received only a few hours ago). Typically, when new Bitcoin users run into this common price-updating issue and send us an email, our standard response is to waive the outstanding satoshis to allow you to take the examination immediately. I would be surprised if any C4 staff responded with any "demand" to pay these 54 satoshis because this is not our standard operating procedures. If you have an email from any C4 staff "demanding" this, I'd like to ask that you forward this to me so I can ensure C4's standard operating procedures are carried out consistently across our enterprise.
Finally, I understand your frustration with the current fees on the Bitcoin network. Sending $35.88 CAD in fees in order to pay $0.01 CAD is frankly ridiculous. It's important to note, though, that this is not C4's fee; this is the Bitcoin network's fee for processing your $0.01 payment. Like every other individual and corporation who depends on Bitcoin for payments, we too find these fees so high that it has almost forced us to stop using Bitcoin altogether. The only reason why we continue to demand payment in bitcoin other than Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, or other payment mechanism is because it requires potential CBPs to USE Bitcoin. It's our form of a "Practical Exam" that shows the applicant understands Bitcoin enough to send it to us as payment. Using Bitcoin as a "practical exam" in this case is more valuable to us than the *significant* Bitcoin network fees we incur when spending the bitcoins we have received.
I hope I've brought clarity to your situation. Please don't hesitate to respond if you have any further questions.

No. You are incorrect. 
Fees cannot be taken “before” a transaction gets on chain because coins cannot move unless they are moved on chain.  
If you are losing coins as you say you are, the evidence is either present in one or more blockchain transactions OR you aren’t losing coins at all. There is no in between.

Both Olivier and Bobby posted their versions of what happened. Comparing the two, they both agreed on facts however both differed on their impressions of those facts (I.e. Opinions)
As an investigator I know full well that there are always 3 versions of every story:
1) what you think happened
2) what they think happened
3) what actually happened. 
Since only Olivier's story referenced that, and since it was a reason for an action and not a fact that occurred  (i.e. it was an opinion) I wouldn't put too much stock in it.

The smoothie example isn't 100% accurate with Zero Knowledge Proofs, but it does a great approximation. The key is that the observer (Victor) has no knowledge of the truth, but he can be assured with almost 100% accuracy that Pam does.
With respect to a bitcoin-specific one, consider this.
Right now all coins are 100% traceable through the blockchain as a means of counterfeit detection. When I send you coins, I reassign my coins to you. There's always a complete trail behind all coins.
If a ZKP were to be applied to that part of Bitcoin, we can know that "someone" transferred 100 coins to us, but we cannot tell where those coins came from (which utxos were spent to send them to us)
As a recipient, we don't necessarily need to know which utxos were spent to give us our cash... we just need to know that we've successfully received cash. A ZKP could allow us to assert we received it without compromising the privacy of the sender.

Specific examples get complicated, but this would be possible with a type of homomorphic encryption that would implement this ZKP.
Let's say someone's driver's license (and the data included on it) are all encrypted so you can't just read someone's birthday. You could perform a homomorphic operation on the birthday field in such a way to assert:
    CurrentDate - BirthDate &gt; 19
The bouncer at the door could use a scanner that would perform this homomorphic algorithm on the encrypted birthdate and all he would see is "true" or "false" without ever knowing the actual birthdate.

2) they funded the bitnodes project which had a measurable impact on the number of full nodes on the Bitcoin network - addressing a clear need in our ecosystem
3) they lobbied against the BitLicense that was released in NYC. Although they were unsuccessful in preventing it, they were successful in changing pieces resulting in a comparatively better result
4) they organized and funded 3 developer-focused workshops in Boston, London, and San Mateo where they educated people on developing with Bitcoin - another clear need in our ecosystem 
5) they developed Bitcoin.org into what it is today and paid for its hosting
6) they commissioned a thorough risk assessment / threat analysis for Bitcoin which continues to be extremely useful for security professionals like myself when addressing risks for our clients (i.e. The public infrastructure)
That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but I only spent 2-3mins. I'll let someone else chime in on  through

Unfortunately has the facts wrong in this case. 
The board did not fire 2 board members. 
Jim proposed a vote to disband and Olivier seconded it. Everyone else said no, they were committed to the mission. 
As a result, the board said "if you guys aren't interested in working with us, perhaps you should resign"
Jim resigned, Olivier didn't.
So they voted to remove Olivier since it was clear he was not willing to work with the board.
This is no different from having an employee refuse to help their company. Why are you here? Move out and let someone else pick up your slack.

@_date: 2015-06-22 15:07:38
Nope. You've got it backwards. 
Price depends on the security of the system, just like every other valued commodity. 
There are a variety of risks to bitcoin including the probability of orphaned blocks, forked codebases, whether or not it will be adopted by end-users, institutions, etc., regulatory issues and more. new risks are realized every day and the price follows the aggregate risk landscape. 
Security does not depend on the price. Just because bitcoin reached $500 doesn't make it more secure than when it was at $400. But when a government releases a licensing scheme that adds a new type of regulatory risk (decreasing security) the price does move down. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:16:11

This wasn't a good idea when he first started talking about it and it's even worse now that it's coded and implemented by a mining pool. 
F2Pool should think critically about the benefits vs the drawbacks here.

I recommend mSIGNA for your offline wallet. 
It supports all major operating systems and complies with all of the latest standards in Bitcoin including BIPs 16, 32, and 39 while having EVERY component 100% open source. 
No need to rely on closed source pieces of hardware or platforms. 
It can also communicate with ANY public bitcoin node natively so you have the choice of either pointing it at a local copy of Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin-XT, or to any node you find online if you'd rather not maintain your own copy of the blockchain. 
Install it on your offline machine and create your keychain offline, then import the public halves on your online machine to watch. You can also import mSIGNA's xpubs into any mobile wallet that supports BIP32 extended keys and multisig to watch your balance from your phone.

Hashrate is only one small piece of security. There are a variety of other risks that affect bitcoin in addition to the risk of orphaned/rolled-back blocks.
There have been many cases where price has changed that did not directly change the hashrate too.
Price does not drive security. Security (of which the hashrate is just one component) drives price.

No, they can't start mining on an empty block and then fill it up to continue.
When building your block to mine, you need to include the merkle root in your block header, which is a digest calculated from all of the transactions included inside your block.
If you started mining on an empty block, the merkle root would reflect 0 transactions. If you then added transactions to the block after-the-fact, the merkle root would change, so you'd need to throw out all of the mining you've done on the empty block and start fresh on the full block.
Miners build the complete block they want to mine first and calculate the merkle root to be included in their block's header. Once that's created, they can begin incrementing the nonce to find one that makes the block fit into the ledger.
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:31:39
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:52:59
You're right - it's not a problem, but conceptually they are mining a completely different block the moment the merkle root changes. None of the previously-tried nonce values can be reused, and every one of them would need to be retried since any one of them could be the winning value.
Probabilistically, there's a higher chance of trying a nonce value within a set you've previously discounted 1,000,000+ values than there is trying a nonce in a completely new set.
Yes, each value statistically has the same chance of being "a winner" but probabilistically, if you've tried 1M values on this set, the next value you check has a higher chance of being "the one" than creating a new set and trying it as the first value.
Then there are those miners who say "screw the network" and ignore transactions altogether, always trying to mine empty blocks just for their reward.
Mining is fun :P

The victory is having a governmental body whose report shows they clearly understand bitcoin technology including the benefits and risks it has to Canadians. 
We've all read reports from other governments bodies (NY) whose recommendations demonstrate a lack of understanding of how digital currencies operate. 
Canada has taken a very reasoned approach to this new technology by gathering facts before acting... And their first report says they recommend allowing the technology to grow and take another look in three years before regulating since there are use cases which haven't yet been imagined. 
Those types of words are regularly spoken by Bitcoin proponents like myself or or so to hear them spoken by a governmental body is a breath of fresh air.

Seems to me that Cryptosteel is designed to be reusable. You can remove and rearrange letters as you decommission old wallets.
If you store the extra letters alongside the Cryptosteel you won't leak any info and will be able to take advantage of the reusable feature.
A dremel is cheap, but I know I can't trust operators to use it to write legible letters on steel, and even if I could, that slab of steel would not be reusable, OR easily destroyed.
It seems with the Cryptosteel, I can open it up, dump the letters, and now the key is destroyed. As long as it can't open'n'dump easily (so it takes effort to do this), it seems like a win/win/win/loss over the Dremel (reusable/easier-to-readwrite/revokable/more-expensive).
For an additional $15 over the dremel, I'll take reusable/easier-to-readwrite/revokable.

@_date: 2015-05-20 15:07:04
I've been waiting for something like this for ages.
Awesome work!
I was going to suggest a change for v2.0 where the CryptoSteel would store 112 characters instead of 96 so it could fit a complete BIP32 Extended Key (i.e. an "xprv").
But then I realized. It can already do this if a convention is applied.
BIP32 Extended Keys have a lot of starting information that is identical for every single root key: the version bytes (which always map to "xprv"), the depth (always "00"), the parent fingerprint ("00000000"), and the child number ("00000000").
This means that all **ROOT** xprvs all begin with the same letters: xprv9s21ZrQH143K.
If you take a 112 character BIP32 extended key and remove those starting letters, there are 96 characters left which can fit perfectly on this CryptoSteel.
I've ordered 10.

I'm not sure what you mean by "stays in the same place."
Once you've upgraded mSIGNA to the latest version, you will have to recreate the transaction (and re-sign it if you are using offline signers) before submitting it to the Bitcoin network.
If you haven't done this yet, right-click the transaction and delete it. You can then re-make the transaction.

I do derive benefit from my non-profit work, yes, but I do not derive income from them.
The benefits I get are the same benefits everyone in the bitcoin space gets. When looking for bitcoin professionals it was tough to find them. Now it's a lot easier; my security company demands that our principals hold CBP certifications. This assures us that we're dealing with people who truly know bitcoin and not with people who say they understand it based off of a few news headlines.
So yes, everyone - including myself - derives benefits from these non-profit organizations, and no, no director of either C4 or BAC earn a salary.

Great question.
Every new technology is met with the exact same scepticism because the benefits of the new technology aren't immediately recognized. Humans are walking pattern-recognition machines and we always compare new things to what we already know so we can categorize it in our brains. Unfortunately, new technologies like bitcoin are so unlike other technologies that new users only compare small pieces of them to what they already know - Bitcoin vs. US dollars in your example.
* "Why do we need railways? Horse and carriage works fine."
* "Why do we need cars? Horses work fine."
* "Why do we need phones? Letter mail works fine."
* "Why do we need email? Phones work fine."
* "Why do we need the Internet? Who cares if computers can talk to each other?"
Obviously today it's easy to look at each of these older technological revolutions and immediately recognize the HUGE benefits that each gave society because we see the outcome. My hindsight is 20/20...what's yours? :D
With new technologies like Bitcoin, the possibilities aren't immediately recognizable to people who only see today's use cases. It takes a lot of time with the new technology to browse websites, send/receive emails, and interact with people on the other side of the planet before you hit your "aha!" moment and say "Wow, this Internet thing will really change the world!"
And that moment is always a personal one that you need to reach on your own.
So to answer your question more specifically, I'd respond to the sentiment by drawing allegories to things your audience is already familiar with, and with patience.
Bitcoin technology isn't just another currency or payment processor, it's a prototype for a completely new type of technology like the Internet was. It will take time for anyone to completely grasp it (it took me a full month!) but they will eventually cross that bridge when they're ready and pushing them across it will only make it more difficult.
"You can bring a person to bitcoin, but you can't force them to transact"....or something about horses and water.

I support any standard that provides discrete measurable criteria on meeting minimum requirements.
I would model these standards after the existing standards we already see and use every day, whether they be safety standards for food, electricity, or personnel knowledge/education.
When you take a look at these models, there's a core committee of people who are both knowledgeable about the particular field as well as committed/motivated to help build and maintain the standard. With respect to the Bitcoin Foundation, I would establish committees and invite community members who are willing and able to join and help build great things together.
A lot of work has been done by a lot of people in our space because of our inherent decentralized nature. As a result, there are a lot of resources posted online by people who are chipping away at the pieces. I would reach out to each of these "doers" to build a team and help lead them to produce something we are all proud of that will help bitcoiners around the world.

I was a full-time investigator in my previous career, but that is not the reason why I am running for a seat on the BF's board.
I'm running because after BF's recent pivot I realized that my non-profit work in standards and certification is suddenly highly relevant to the non-profit work that the BF is now concentrating on. Our goals are complementary, so it makes sense to work together.
That said, I've been known to hold my fellow directors on the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada's board to high levels of disclosure when it comes to conflicts of interest. If I see something that could be construed as a conflict by other BF members, I will definitely call it out for open discussion. Wherever appropriate, I will also ask the conflicted members to recuse themselves from either voting on resolutions or participating in discussions about upcoming resolutions in accordance with the BF's bylaw 5.15.

I am not an accredited investor, and this is not investment advice.
The current trade price of bitcoin is the least important thing about bitcoin.
What I do know is, every day there are more and more people who own bitcoin. Every day there is an average of more and more transactions seen on the network. Search engines track more and more searches for bitcoin and website services track more and more users of their services each day.
Bitcoin lets anyone send any amount of money anywhere in the world at any time for little-or-no fees at all.
Bitcoin is a blueprint for a new way of interacting with others on the Internet - in a completely decentralized way without any need for a central server.

I will continue to work on standards and certifications in our industry.
Standards help developers, businesses, and end-users know what is necessary to "meet the bar" when it comes to protecting coins and information. Certifications let people know you successfully meet those bars.
I want the BF to publish clear standards for our industry in the realms of personnel, security, and business practices with cryptocurrencies. I also want to help the foundation provide workshops and training in these areas so that people can learn what is needed, and certifications to let them prove to the public that they are doing things properly.
Standards and Certifications have been my primary focus for the last year, and with BF's recent pivot, it's a perfect match between what I'm already doing and what the BF needs to do.

Anyone who makes a point and backs it up with cogent arguments influences someone else's opinions; that's how rhetoric works.
I don't think anyone can say that they are immune to the influence of well-formed thoughts backed up by cogent arguments.
That said, I am not influenced by any company that competes with me or my interests. I've made my interests clear and "put my money where my mouth is" by creating a non-profit organization to further my interests of seeing bitcoin succeed worldwide. I believe that proper standards and certifications will help bitcoin achieve this success, and I will continue to pursue this for the good of the industry regardless of what hat I'm wearing or what name is on my door.

I believe that in most countries, bitcoin is already regulated.
We have laws governing theft, sale of dangerous substances, money laundering, etc. Each of those laws applies to any form of value whether it is cash, gift cards, or bitcoin.
Consumer protection laws protect consumers from bad merchants, and they make no mention of whether payment was rendered in cash, credit card, debit, paypal, or bitcoin. These mediums aren't mentioned because they don't matter to the regulation; the acts of people matter.
So my view on regulation is: bitcoin doesn't need any new regulations whatsoever. The existing regulations that govern crimes either already cover bitcoin, or they should be expanded with the *least amount of changes possible* to include bitcoin alongside every other form of value that the regulations already cover.

There are two questions there.
I don't see bitcoin ever fully replacing fiat any more than email will ever fully replace letter mail. We've had email technology since the early 1970s and even after 4 decades we still have a use for lugging packages made from dead trees around our planet, whether it is legal (real signatures vs. scanned ones) or societal (wedding invitations via email are still tacky)
I think bitcoin will take over the vast majority of financial transactions in the future just like email has taken over the vast majority of mail, but there will always be a use for "classical" currencies.

I can list a few off the top of my head for dev standards, legal standards, security standards, and business standards but listing them here in an informal AMA would necessarily exclude some who may provide as much - if not more - valuable input as those who are at the tip of my tongue at this moment.

I don't take a "softly-softly" approach, I take a reasoned and measured approach. Anyone who acts on incomplete information is taking an unnecessary risk that could harm the community as a whole rather than help it with their action.
The way GAW has conducted itself does not meet the definition of a [ponzi scheme]( and a quick 10min glance at a forum will only yield opinions of people who are emotionally invested in the situation rather than the "whole story" that you claim it will provide.
I've been employed as an investigator full-time and understand completely what the full weight of evidence brings to the table in comparison with allegations and opinions. Any acts I take as a director of the BF or any other office I hold will always be dealt squarely with the facts and not the opinions of the masses.
I hope you don't interpret my words as a vote of confidence for GAW, and while we're on the matter, I hope they're not interpreted as a vote of non-confidence either. I am confident that the facts will speak for themselves, and I am patient enough to wait to review them before forming any opinion - or worse - taking any action as a result.
Now... while my campaign for a board seat has been formed based on the standards and certifications that I believe will help bitcoin, perhaps my experience as a forensic investigator will be helpful to the board in cases such as these to ensure that proper procedures are followed in order to yield the best possible outcomes. At the very least, I'm sure we would both agree that this experience wouldn't hurt.

I commend Mike Hearn for completing this project and placing it online. Having a semi-decentralized crowdfunding platform is a great addition to our community and I look forward to seeing what people do with it.
Despite this achievement, I have to disagree with your claim that


The fact is, bitcoin development is already truly decentralized and has been since Satoshi published the code online for anyone to use.
Anyone can copy the code, make their edits, and merge those edits into the code via a pull request, and this has been possible long before Lighthouse was released.
The Bitcoin Foundation's "centralization" of bitcoin core development is no more centralized than the Linux Foundation's "centralization" of Linux development. There are dozens of companies (RedHat, Suse, Canonical, Mandriva, Oracle, etc.) who continue to contribute to Linux in a decentralized fashion in the same way that many companies in our industry are stepping up to the plate today (BitPay, Armory, etc.)
The fact is, Bitcoin Foundation has never had a centralized control on bitcoin core development, and claiming that it does represents a fundamental misunderstanding of what the BF is and its mission statement. Spreading this inaccuracy only serves to mislead the public.
Despite this, I applaud Mike Hearn's hard work and recognize Lighthouse's utility in our industry.

With mSIGNA, you have full control over all private keys in an easy-to-use UI. The only reason it isn't a "mainstream" or popular wallet is because the developer - Eric Lombrozo - is notoriously cautious. Despite this, mSIGNA is ready for public use and provides the UI+control over keys you are looking for.
My security company recommends the use of mSIGNA software for our enterprise clients, and we feel it has advantages over Armory despite Armory's popularity.

Interesting questions.
For your first one: the current trade price of bitcoins is the least important fact about Bitcoin. I've abandoned a career as a well-respected cyber-investigator to pursue bitcoin endeavours full-time, and that includes both for-profit companies (like my bitcoin security company) and non-profit companies (like my standards/certification company). I want to work on bitcoin because I believe in the technology and I find it extremely interesting. Being able to wake up in the morning to work on your passion is a great way to live.
As for your second question, I am directly involved with 3 bitcoin organizations which are listed on both my BF candidate thread and my LinkedIn profile.
Despite my involvement with them, I can honestly say that I hold no investments (major or minor) that would influence any policy positions I could make as a director on the BF's board.

You're right, I did know that, and I'm happy I cleared up any confusion you may have had regarding income or financial benefits with my involvement with both C4 and BAC. Neither of them pay me.
After careful consideration, I'm going to agree with your assessment of my motives. They are self-serving. I will personally benefit by helping promote bitcoin world-wide and elevating bitcoin to the next level by helping the foundation publish standards and certifications in our industry. Not only will my personal bitcoin holdings increase in value, but I will achieve a sense of personal pride in what I helped the industry accomplish through my efforts.

Bitcoin development has been "fully decentralized" since Satoshi placed the code online. Anyone can already fork the code, contribute features/bugfixes, and have those merged into the mainline client.
Others can fork the code and release it under different names, like we see with the thousands of altcoins that exist.
Lighthouse is a great platform, but we don't need it to decentralize bitcoin development. That is already decentralized.

I think BF should focus solely on the Bitcoin protocol and reference implementation (i.e. Bitcoin Core), and projects related to the standardization and certification of these.
There are some wallets which are launched with security vulnerabilities that the authors weren't aware of. The fact is, crypto isn't easy and it takes properly educated programmers/security professionals to implement cryptography properly.
I'd love to see the BF host conferences dedicated to developers, programmers, auditors and cryptographers and offer in-person training, workshops, and certifications. Anyone who wishes to fill one of these roles can attend one of these conferences to learn real skills from professionals and take them back to their place of business/home. This would make bitcoin software much more safe and secure for everyone using it.

If you sacrifice the decentralization of bitcoin, it is no longer a disruptive technology. I personally wouldn't be here today if bitcoin was a centralized idea because there's nothing novel about that.
I would support a hard fork if and only if the benefits to all are clear and it's done in a way that has the full backing of the majority of people using the technology in advance. i.e. a voluntary hard fork that many of us choose to follow.
I would not support any hard fork that would undermine the core tenets of bitcoin.

Good question.
In my capacity as director for the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, I helped organize outreach efforts to provide quality information to our government about Bitcoin. The last thing I ever want is someone to make a knee-jerk reaction to Bitcoin without fully understanding it as it could lead to irreparable harm to the innovation and growth we are seeing in Canada.
In this capacity I [approached the Finance Critic for Ontario]( to help explain Bitcoin, highlight the benefits, and correct any misconceptions. I've met with the [Ontario Securities Commission]( twice with BAC's legal counsel Stuart Hoegner to help explain Bitcoin to them as well. Most recently, I spoke to the [Canadian Senate's hearing on Banking and Commerce]( about Bitcoin alongside Stuart Hoegner in the same round of witness appearances that brought Andreas M. Antonopoulos to Canada.
With regards to your second question, ~~I have to make a correction: C4 is a *not-for-profit organization* and not a *for-profit* organization as you are alleging. We do not "sell" training and certification services in the Bitcoin space.~~ C4 was formed to fill a need that was recognized in our industry - a way for hiring managers to identify bitcoin talent in applicants. We recognized right away that providing this to the industry in a for-profit model would represent a conflict of interest between "making money" and "certifying professionals."
The revenue that C4 takes in from its very modest exam fees goes towards covering the organization's costs and we've pledged to donate ALL profits to other organizations in the Bitcoin space that can make the best use of it.
With respect to potential conflicts of interest between me serving on C4's board and BF's board, I do not perceive this as a conflict. Instead, I see it as synergy. Both boards are non-profit boards and in both capacities the goal is the same: provide the industry with clear standards and certifications. I plan on working towards this goal regardless of what hat I'm wearing or what name is on my door because I firmly believe [like Patrick Murck believes]( that standards and certifications are needed and will help bring bitcoin technology to the next level. I'll happily carry out whichever is the best method of accomplishing this with input from my fellow directors of C4 and BF.
EDIT: oops you sniped that for-profit mistake while I was writing. Fixed.

There are many lobbying and education groups around the world who are dedicated to those missions in various regions, whether they are in specific countries (Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, Fundação Bitcoin Brasil, Chamber of Digital Commerce) or online (Bitcoin Education Project, CoinAcademy, etc.).
I think the BF's recent pivot to concentrate solely on Bitcoin's protocol, reference implementation, and standards and certifications surrounding these aspects is a great way to focus efforts on things that aren't necessarily being handled by other groups.
Allowing these other groups to tackle lobbying and education frees BF staff up to concentrate on the code.
TL;DR: I like it.

I was able to answer almost all questions asked of me at the senate. With respect to being able to understand, I believe you're talking about the question that was asked of me by Senator Massicotte at the 53:30 mark.
The simple fact is, while I speak both English and French, hearing both languages asking the same question at the same time (through the earpiece) threw me off. It resulted in me not understanding the question in either language which is why I asked Senator Massicotte to repeat his question. I've sort of kicked myself in the shin over this ever since it happened.
Hindsight is 20:20 and I provided clarification to this question via email after the session was complete to hopefully clear the air. The question was about whether or not bitcoin transactions are traceable and whether or not it's possible to identify actors who have participated in bitcoin transactions.
This is the email that I had sent to the senate committee after that hearing:

This has bothered me a lot too, and I agree that most people who use 'blockchain' as a proper noun don't fully understand the technology. 
'Blockchain' is a common noun, like 'car', 'boat', and 'database'.
It's not a proper noun like 'Michael', 'Toronto', or 'Google'.
Common nouns need another word to identify the instance (Roger's car, or that boat, the accounting database, or Bitcoin's blockchain) whereas proper nouns identify them implicitly.
I imagine they do it for similar reasons most of us assumed Bitcoin was a company or a product when we first heard the word. Blockchains are a totally new concept. Education and training are definitely needed.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:48:03
First off, I have to reject the premise of your question. That's like asking someone "Does your boss know you're a pervert?" Whether they answer 'yes' or 'no' they are implicitly agreeing to being a pervert.
The Bitcoin Foundation is not criminal in nature.
Now yes, there was a board member who resigned due to criminal allegations, and he plead guilty to those allegations, but those actions were undertaken by an individual and not the board itself.
With respect to paycoin, as it's clearly a very fresh story there is still a lot of information that is yet to come to light and become verified. I'd prefer to "wait and see" before making any knee-jerk reactions - very much the same strategy I support governments taking with respect to bitcoin.

To be fair, their cameras were clearly visible so I wouldn't call it "secretly" filming any more than the event itself was "secret"
That said, I'm with you 100% that the attendees expected no film and were surprised to be filmed. When I walked out of the meeting towards the bathroom, suddenly I found myself on camera inbetween the hosts and whichever attendee they were filming at the time. This was sudden and unexpected, and I can totally understand someone not wanting to be filmed at all... especially when there's only 1 corridor between the room and the bathroom!

But if you unlock with another pin, you get a second set of addresses. - a "duress pin"
You can keep 95% of your coins on your regular set of addresses and 5% on your "duress addresses"
If someone is forcing you to unlock your ledger, type your duress pin instead. They'll see you're poor and only have $100 worth of coins, steal it, and hopefully that's that. You appear to be complying with them and letting them take your crypto but in reality you're hiding your true stash by typing your duress pin instead.

If you’ve received 50 small payments to 50 addresses and you try to send one large payment, bitcoind will automatically choose all of the small inputs to pay the one large output. 
If you want to specify which inputs to choose manually, you can activate coin control and choose them in the GUI or build the transaction manually on the cli.
I would not recommend trying to build the transaction manually on the cli unless you have a thorough understanding of how transactions work under the hood. You can accidentally lose a lot of bitcoin if you’re not careful.

Bitcoin is a protocol for value over IP.
Email is "letters over IP", Skype is "voice over IP", and Bitcoin is "value over IP"
Give your bitcoin address to someone and they can send "money" to you over the Internet just like they can send email to your email address. 
The big difference is it is decentralized, so there is no middle man. It goes directly from sender to recipient without going through a bank or payment processor... and once it's sent, it can't be undone sorta like email.
It's much cheaper because there is no company taking their cut of your transfer.
You can download one of many bitcoin clients - wallet apps - for any OS on your desktop or mobile device.

Blockchain is a company based out of the UK. They take security very seriously, so they benefit security by keeping their products and services secure. 
Blockchain gets their name from a concept by the same name. A blockchain is a computing construct similar to a database but that does not support edits. It's a write-only Information store where immutable snapshots of state are added sequentially by anyone in the world. Blockchains benefit security by proving integrity of an information store in a distributed network like the Internet where disparate parties do not necessarily trust one another. 
Blockchain the company develops products and services on top of Bitcoin's blockchain which is the world's oldest/first blockchain.

Nothing prevents the use of someone else's public key, but using it doesn't do anything useful. 
Anyone can create a transfer from anyone's bitcoin address to any other bitcoin address; all you need to do is find bitcoins in someone's account that you want to move. 
It's like writing a cheque; you can write in anyone's name, account number and any amount you want. 
The tough part is the digital signature. You need someone's private key to generate a digital signature that will match. Without a valid digital signature the network will reject the transaction the same way a bank teller would reject a cheque that is not signed.  Where it's somewhat easy to forge a handwritten signature on a cheque by making the signature "close enough", a digital signature immediately highlights even the tiniest difference. 
TL;DR: the public key doesn't authorize the transfer of coins. The private one does.

You're mixing the token with the purpose. 
Fiat money made of linen bills. Coins made of gold or copper. Tokens traded on a blockchain. The unit doesn't matter. What matters is that the community all collectively agrees that "this" is worth "that much" value. As long as we all agree it doesn't matter what unit we use.
Miners are NOT the equivalent of shells. Miners are bank tellers. They update the ledger of who owns how much and they get paid for doing that job. With fiat, the banks pay the tellers. With bitcoin, the tellers are allowed to create new tokens out of thin air and assign them to their own accounts. 
There are exactly 0 trades you can facilitate with bitcoin that you can't with fiat cash. There are exactly 0 things you can buy with euros that you can't buy with dollars. Money is money. Bitcoin isn't made to let you buy new things; It's made to let you transfer value instantly without needing a middleman. 
PayPal can freeze your funds. Western Union can charge you high fees. Banks can close your accounts and leave you without the ability to write cheques. 
But bitcoin payments cannot be stopped, bitcoin accounts cannot be frozen, and bitcoins cannot be confiscated. It gives you all the things fiat dollars/euros/rubles give you with the added ability of being unstoppable and not being counterfeit either by crooks or devalued by governments deciding to will $10B into the economy with a stroke of a pen.

You've introduced regulation as a savior to a lack of supply for rare shells. This confuses two unrelated concepts in what appears to validate your misconception that regulation is required. 
It is not. 
If Farmer Fred pioneers an island-wide farm and ends up with a monopoly of rare shells, you are right that the economy would collapse. Every currency has a risk of one entity cornering the market and there is no tradable good that is immune to this. 
While forcing Fred to pay Gerry the Govermentarian a tax for his monopoly seems to solve the problem in the short term (then there's more shells for everyone else to use!) it's not a solution; it's kicking the van down the road. Over time, Gerry and his Government will end up holding the monopoly since all islanders need to pay yearly taxes, and all monopolies pay him too. Gerry is a Fred without having another Gerry on top of him to spread the shells around again. 
Regulation doesn't fix cornering the market.
Every two generations or so a currency dies. It's happened since the Roman times and today is no different. Bitcoins are just as good as shells are today, but that doesn't mean bitcoin or shells will still be good ten years down the road. A huge cache of shells may be found on the other side of the island that devalues everyone's shells. A printing press may print counterfeit bills. But bitcoin's cryptography protects against devaluation. 
What matters for any currency is its ability to facilitate trade amongst its society. Bitcoin does that. Yes, like EVERY other currency it will fluctuate in value based on its perceived utility. Yes these fluctuations could mean you lose value in a period of time. And yes, tomorrow our society may find that it is no longer serving us as well as it does today.
Currencies rise and fall. Bitcoin is new and has high utility within our community of bitcoin users. We'll continue using it until it doesn't make sense for us any more. This is no different than you using Rubbles, Euros, or Dollars today, or whatever we were using 300y ago or what we will use 300y from now.

Every currency requires regulation?
I'm not being a zealot, but I am challenging your preconception that regulation is required. I had this misconception too before I understood bitcoin.
It's easy to say currency requires regulation when we've grown up in a society that has a regulated currency because that's all we know. The reality is, regulation isn't necessary for a currency to serve society. 
Consider an island with 10 participants. It's too complicated to trade rainwater for vegetables for shelter for chickens etc. so we decide to use a rare type of shell on the island as a common tradable good. One chicken is 4 shells, a carrot is 1 shell, we establish prices ourselves and adjust as necessary. 
There is no government regulating our use of shells, only a free market where we set our prices and trade when parties agree. If things are overpriced, our community members don't buy. When we lower the price, trade happens again. 
These shells - and our bitcoin - are perfectly good currencies within our communities despite the lack of regulation

I'm a hardcore 1Password user. I'm also an infosec professional who has focused exclusively on key management and blockchain security for the last 5 years. I've investigated dozens of breaches and advised end-users, enterprises and exchanges on the  design of vault systems with the highest security. 
I do not store any seeds in my 1Password database. 
Seeds must always be stored offline. 
Usernames and passwords can be stored in a database, but I store my seeds in physical form (paper or steel).
Furthermore, none of your 2FA tokens should be backed up in 1Password in case someone makes a physical copy of your DB and manages to bruteforce the master password. The 2FA token is designed to secure your account against password discovery so storing these beside your password defeats the purpose.
I'm happy to answer any questions you have on secure storage.

No. 
Digital signatures include a cryptographic digest of the original message. The signature has a hash of the transaction. 
This means that any change in the transaction will make the signature fail to validate.
Signatures can't be copy/pasted like they can on handwritten cheques. Each digital signature is unique to the transaction it signs.
@_date: 2016-12-03 17:40:37
Yes some malware can change the transaction before it's signed by the user and trick them into signing the wrong transaction
It's like the old stack of papers trick that tricks someone into signing a different sheet than they thought they were.
But this is an entirely different concept from changing the signature of an already-signed transaction

Bitcoin is a protocol, which can be considered as "a way of talking" - similar to a language.
Even if every government and civil servant colluded to ban anyone from speaking French, there's no way to actually stop 1 person speaking a French sentence to another.
Bitcoin is the same thing. Even with laws making it illegal and firewalls blocking port 8333 and deep packet inspection looking for computers speaking the bitcoin protocol, nothing can stop one computer from sending an encrypted bitcoin message to another.

Some miners took shortcuts. 
Instead of doing full validation of a block before mining on top of it, some miners ignored validation and just mined on top of any block that was found regardless if it was valid to increase the chances they could mine the next block.

You may not need to crack it if your private key is in WIF format.
In WIF, the last 8 characters are a checksum. You can strip off the last 5 characters of what you have (the missing 3 + 5 = 8) and recalculate the checksum, append it, and the private key will once again be complete.

I've only skimmed the code but from what I can glean from it, this allows for contracts that have an end date and end condition. 
In the case of Lightning transactions (payment channels) it's possible for one of the two parties to stop signing their transactions resulting in a stalled channel. 
If Alice and Bob are making regular payments between each other, they establish a channel and regularly update the progress of their payments by signing transactions. If Bob really pisses off Alice, Alice can choose to stop signing. (Or Alice could die resulting in the same thing)
There could be 5btc locked in Alice's side of the channel that should go to Bob, but Alice is either dead or saying "I don't care if I lose 2.5BTC, I'm making Bob lose 5BTC because he's an ass!!!"
Normally this would result in the last-signed transaction being the only recourse.
With this patch, I believe it means you can specify that if 10 blocks pass without any signatures, all funds in the channel are returned to Bob. It's basically a time limit on the channel with a return address specified.

They are not gone. 
If you build a Bitcoin redeem script with the same keys that you used for litecoin and in the same order, you will get the same P2SH address for Bitcoin. 
Importing this script and keys into a Bitcoin client like Core or mSIGNA will work and you can then rescan the chain to see the balance. 
You'll then be able to spend the coins and return them to your regular wallet. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:36:28
Yup. 
Pycoin is an easy pythonic way to do it. 
Within a transaction, addresses are represented by the ripemd160 hash of a public key. Addresses themselves are not present. 
So you'll have to parse the Tx to identify the hash160s receiving the outputs and then do some base58 manipulation to turn them into readable addresses. 
Pycoin automates a lot of this for you.

the difficulty target requires a block's hash to start with a certain number of 0 bits.
Let's walk through an example. Let's say the current difficulty dictates that blocks need to start with ten 0 bits. A valid block hash could then begin with the following sixteen bits: 0000000000101010. If we were to convert these sixteen bits into hexadecimal format we'd get 0x002A. See how that starts with 2, a "low" number?
Because byte boundaries exist at every 8 bits, and because difficulty targets could require 10, 11, or other quantities of leading zeros, it's common for the first few bits of a byte to always be zeros.
You can still get an F as the starting non-zero byte if the difficulty target happens to land exactly on a byte boundary and the next 8 bits are all 1s, it's just less common since difficulty targets have 7/8 opportunities at landing mid-byte and 1/8 opportunities to land exactly on a byte boundary.

That is correct. Simple substitution like that will not work.
But the owner of the pubkey can take the real pubkey (not the hash160) and build a redeemScript with it that is identical to the redeemScript used when he sent bitcoins to the litecoin address.
That redeemScript can then be hashed so that OP_HASH160 &lt;hash-of-script&gt; OP_EQUAL will work.

Security is a lot more than the tech. Saying to someone "just use mSIGNA" or "just use a Trezor" can be incredibly insecure if the operators don't know how to use these tools securely, or if they don't have proper procedures and protocols in place to handle key compromise events.

Your problem isn't with Electrum. It's your current understanding of Bitcoin. That's ok though! We were all where you are right now!
With Bitcoin you should be using different addresses for every transaction. This protects your privacy and makes it easier to keep track of where your money came from. Every time you accept money for anything, give the next address in your list to the sender. 
Almost every Bitcoin wallet uses multiple addresses like Electrum does. Once you become familiar with Bitcoin you will understand that multiple addresses is a good thing.

I don't think Bitcoin lacks these wallets, but I do think some of the best wallets lack popularity.
[mSIGNA from Ciphrex]( does everything you've asked for and has been used to successfully secure MILLIONS of dollars worth of Bitcoin.
It has all of the boring features that everyone should EXPECT from a software wallet (hierarchical deterministic seeds, multisignature, 100% offline signing, and bip32/bip39 compatibility) but it also has some really cool features that others don't.
The coolest is the ability to speak bitcoin's wire protocol natively. This allows you the freedom to choose to point mSIGNA at a local copy of the blockchain (bitcoin-qt/core/classic) that you've downloaded yourself, OR you can point it to [any IP address]( of any bitcoin node anywhere on the Internet to use their copy of the chain. This lets you run it with complete privacy over TOR, or if you're lazy it lets you quickly connect/broadcast your transaction without downloading the chain.

Well, let's say you want to spend bitcoin stored at the address backed by the key on your SD card.
How do you move the funds?
You could sync a new bitcoind node and then importprivkey...but that'll take a few hours and now the key is online making the whole SD card thing useless.
You could sync a bitcoind node online and then copy the blockchain to an offline computer, importprivkey the key onto the offline machine and use some more CLI commands to build+sign the transaction and move it to an online machine...
but again that's a process that takes a few hours.
The key is technically in cold storage and is offline, but it's not really usable at all.
If you take that same key and put it into a wallet file (either an mSIGNA or Electrum wallet file) and put that file on the SD card instead you can *use* it much more easily than a text file with the private key inside. Both mSIGNA and Electrum have nice GUIs that make it easy to prepare the transaction online, transfer it offline, sign it, and transfer the signed transaction online again.
...and we didn't even get into technical issues that could cause your SD card to fail, have its data corrupted, or otherwise be lost because they're so tiny!
The other posters in this thread have an even-more-usable suggestion too. Just buy a hardware wallet and back up the seed securely. Back in 2011 we NEEDED to jump through lots of crazy hoops to maximize our security. Now we can buy a device to do it for us.

Technically yes. Cold storage is a key that is not available from any online device. 
But a WIF key in a text file on an SD card is not usable. When you want to spend from that key you will have a hard time. 
You may wish to consider mSIGNA or Electrum. You can put the key in a wallet file on that SD card and plug it into your offline laptop when you need to sign (which can be running OSX or Windows or Linux)
You'll be able to watch the balance on your online with an online copy of your wallet file, and when you need to spend you can use QR codes to pass the signing request and the signed transaction back and forth.

Trusting the contributors to the Factom client is no different than trusting the contributors to the Bitcoin client, and the maintainers of bitcoin.org. The risk of malware, compromised signing keys, etc. is no different. As long as the code is open for any to peer-review, and there are trusted personnel who review changes before including them in releases (just like we trust the collective Gavin/Garzik/Wuille/Lombrozo/Wlad/Luke-jr) who call each other out on bad updates (Luke-jr), the risk to the community-as-a-whole is minimal.
If someone wants to pay a few cents to secure a PNG of child porn, AND they want to host it on one of their webservers so people can confirm that PNG hasn't been altered after the hash was made, that's up to them. As you say, they will go to jail.
I personally don't mind holding the full chain of hashes since a hash of a dirty PNG isn't the PNG itself, but there's no way I'm going to mirror/host that PNG on my own.
Your point about 4-5 centralized services offering similar features to Factom is a good one, though. Yes it's possible to pay 5 companies to hash your data 5 times each, making it easy to detect when one of them alters a hash, and protecting yourself against one of those companies disappearing.
But that's 5 API calls for 5 services and a requirement for your users to use 5 API calls at 5 services to validate what you give them.
Frankly, it's easier to use 1 system to secure data, and let your customers use 1 system to validate it. 
But you're right. Let's let the market decide.

Better in one way but worse in others. 
If you're storing your own data and hashing it yourself, I have no way to know you didn't alter the data and rehash it. I can ask you for the hashes and you can give me the new ones and they will check out. 
Using a hashing service like Verisign's fixes some problems but not all. They are centralized and can disappear or change their hashes for a sum of money or insider collusion. 
A peer to peer network validates itself and assures everyone that the hashes have never been altered. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:32:58
See my comment here: 
The specifics of what is stored doesn't matter because a porn file and a link to a porn file and a torrent that facilitates download of a porn file are all considered the same (i.e. we already have that problem with Bitcoin and so far it's going well? but you're right it's a risk - it's just not a new risk to Factom; it's a risk shared by all blockchains)

Again: this is not a problem that plagues only Factom.
It's a reality that affects every data storage mechanism everywhere. 
People can upload CP to Google Drive, Microsoft SkyDrive, Apple iCloud, Storj, the SAFE network, and hell they can even tape it to the side of a bus. 
The fact that Factom is building a system that can be abused in the same way isn't a drawback with Factom. That's like blaming the bus because some idiot taped a poster to its side. We trust the authorities to analyze the context here and deal with the person who taped the poster rather than suing the bus company for displaying porn in public. 
Good luck indeed.

I don't know what happened exactly, but if the linked article is true, this was an impersonation attack. 
The [CryptoCurrency Security Standard]( has provisions to prevent such a thing by requiring all cold storage withdrawals to be verified by cryptographic signatures or voice authorization prior to being carried out. 
Had BitPay followed the CCSS standard, impersonation attacks of this kind would be ineffective at exfiltrating bitcoins from cold storage. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 19:50:05
You don't need to host a full node for mSIGNA, but it supports the use of a self-hosted full node for privacy.
If you don't want to download a full node (and you are OK with the privacy implications of using someone else's node), you can point mSIGNA to any bitcoin node anywhere on the Internet instead.
The author of mSIGNA, Eric Lombrozo, is notoriously shy on social media. He's a great programmer who has contributed many enhancements and bug fixes to Bitcoin core, but he likes to stay relatively quiet on the Internet.
Many pro bitcoiners use mSIGNA, but it's not really well-known amongst average users because it's more technically complex and harder to use than "easy" wallets like breadwallet/etc.

No, a code signing key that is used to sign a release is a very common thing in the software world.
Take a look at Bitcoin's signatures here: 
The private key that signed those hashes is held securely by the trusted contributors to the Bitcoin client. We place a LOT of trust in Wlad et al. to not abuse that key and sign malware-ridden binaries.
This trust is technically centralized, just like the trust in Factom's client will have to be somewhat centralized.
My point is that the two yield equivalent risks and rewards. If we're fine with trusting this model for Bitcoin, I don't see why it's bad to trust this model with Factom.

@_date: 2015-04-10 15:42:47
Before I reply to your blog post, I have to disclose something. While I am not a Factom employee, I am a contractor for them and delivered security-related services to them.
During the past few months, I had the opportunity to interact with various Factom employees and I learned quite a bit about their design. As a result, I personally purchased Factoids in their software sale.
Take that how you will.
Here are my responses to each of your points:
1) The Easily Inserted Data Problem
Yes it's a problem that bad chain data can be inserted that may leverage a vulnerability in an auditor program, causing it to crash. This is no different than a weird transaction being included in the Bitcoin blockchain that causes bitcoind to crash. Satoshi was able to build a very robust "auditor program" with no prior history/experience in blockchain technology. It's a bit naive to think that the Factom team (with the amazing minds they've gathered) won't be able to equal Satoshi's achievement using the 6 years of blockchain experience that developers have today.
Also, fixing the auditor program is the correct thing to do, just like bitcoind has been patched in the past. The difference here is that Factom can use one of their highly-protected offline signing keys to digitally sign the new auditor and publish the hash on a chain, allowing everyone to verify that a) there's a new auditor program available and b) the Factom organization attests that this specific one is legit. There's no need to start a new chain or ruin old timestamps - simply append a new entry.
2) The Illegal Possession Problem
This is a non-issue as has been proven by the Bitcoin blockchain itself. People have already published links to [child porn on the Bitcoin blockchain]( as well as [malware/virus fingerprints]( the [copyrighted DVD "AACS" keys]( and other shady things.
The world didn't end.
Instead, law enforcement personnel and DMCA lawyers both showed an amazing amount of understanding with the particulars of these cases. Nobody was jailed or sued for holding the blockchain on their computers.
With Factom, it's up to YOU to host the data that's secured by the Factom blockchain, and it's up to YOU to serve it to others upon request... so if you're going to be securing child porn or copyrighted materials, it's you who will be serving that data to whoever requests it, meaning it's you who will bare the consequences. Not Factom.
3) The Game Theoretical Problem of Keeping Data
You're right that people who choose to run open Factom nodes to host everyone else's data will do so either altruistically or for financial benefit, and you're right that the financial benefit approaches nil/negative if they need to serve giant amounts of data that change infrequently. However, you're missing the point of Factom.
The Factom chain holds the hashes for all of the secured data, but not the data itself. It's up to other webservers/fileservers to host the secured data as necessary.
If I am a government that is securing land titles, I'm going to have a few hard drives hosting the title data to whoever needs it. If I'm a Bitcoin exchange publishing my proof of reserves on the Factom chain, you better believe that I will be hosting all of the data necessary to prove my proof of reserves haven't been tampered with. It's not up to the public to host my data, it's up to me. Factom just makes sure I haven't modified my data afterwards. While a centralized service like Verisgn's may work in this case, it depends on trust of a centralized Verisign. Factom's solution distributes the hashes in a peer-to-peer network so I don't have to worry about Verisign disappearing, or even Verisign silently altering my hashes. The peer-to-peer network ensures it's easy to detect anyone altering any piece.
Your blog post definitely did raise concerns about securing data, and I'm happy to say that the Factom team has not only already considered each of these problems, but their design addresses them properly. Now it's up to them to execute on their design and deliver what they've promised so they can earn the bitcoin that's being held over their heads.

No. 
This is a bad idea from a security POV.
Every biometric identifier is inherently public. Every glass you touch has your fingerprints, every photo has your facial geometry and maybe your retina, and every hair and skin cell you shed has your DNA. 
This is equivalent to walking around with your private key on a note taped to your forehead. 
In addition, every biometric reader has threshold value because our bodies change naturally. This threshold lets the system identify you even if you have a scratch or are subtly different from the enrollment sample. 
That's the equivalent of typing your 30character password with 8 typos but still getting in. 
Biometrics should be used for identity. Not for authorization. 
Treat all biometrics like a username (or email address) and you're fine. Always prompt them for a secret.

@_date: 2015-04-10 16:43:42
And I'm not sure you understand either.
Factom isn't a distributed storage service like Storj or the SAFE network (Maidsafe). Factom secures data, but it does not host data.
It's up to you to host the data separately so others can compare their own hashes with what has been published within Factom. Alternatively, you can choose to not host the data now and publish it tomorrow for proof you used it. (think Satoshi Dice's provably fair system)
If someone were to pay to secure a PNG, they still need to host the PNG so you can retrieve it out-of-band. That means they need to host child porn.
The porn is not in Factom's chain, however its hash is.
EDIT: I apologize if the above post came across as combative. I realize now the cause for your concerns over Factom are based on a misunderstanding that Factom stores all of the data. I hope I've clarified this and addressed your concerns!

Without knowing what the error said it's hard to help. 
Two things: make sure mSigna is pointed to a current copy of the blockchain. If you're running Core yourself, point mSigna to localhost. 
If you're not running core, go to  and choose one. MSigna is awesome like that - it's like electrum where you can choose your server, but EVERY node is a server :)
When mSigna's light at bottom-right is green you should see your coins. If there's an unconfirmed transaction that has your coins stuck: simply right-click it and delete that tx. (Or, right-click it and rebroadcast it if you want to try it again. Make sure you've included appropriate fees though!)
MSigna is an advanced wallet, not a simple one. It's my go-to wallet of choice but I recommend it only to experienced bitcoiners not newbs.

It seems we have disagreement over what Factom actually stores. Since Factom is still just a design and is not yet an implementation, we can't easily reference the source to know for certain. I'm sure a Factom developer can chime in here to clear things up with facts.
Regardless of that, though, we do know that the legal precedents for both child porn and copyrighted materials have been set.
Whether you host contraband, link to it, or host torrent files that facilitate their download, ALL of these are considered equal to hosting the file itself. This is not a drawback with Factom itself, but is a drawback with all forms of data storage including the Bitcoin blockchain, Storj, and Factom.
There will always be idiots who think it's fun to put this incriminating data into a chain that distributes it across thousands of HDDs around the world. We can't stop them from doing that, and Factom isn't designed to stop them from doing it any more than Bitcoin is.
We just have to accept the fact that this will happen and place faith in authorities and lawyers that they will understand the difference between someone actually dealing with these files or hosting a generic blockchain. Thankfully so far (at least with Bitcoin) it seems the authorities and lawyers understand the difference.

This point was explained to Olivier by 3 of his fellow candidates during the election debate. 
His belief that the Bitcoin Foundation has "centralized" core development is simply incorrect. 
Yes, Gavin and Wladimir's salaries are paid by the foundation, but Garzik's salary is paid by BitPay. 
Peter Todd earns his own salary. 
Ciphrex pays Lombrozo. 
Blockstream pays the salary of a few more. 
The BF might have 20% of the core devs on their payroll, if that.
That is not centralization. 
It's analogous to the Linux foundation and he developers who work for RedHat, Suse, Mozilla, Ubuntu, et al.
Despite laying these facts on the table, they were ignored with fingers in ears amid repetition of the original claim.

It's definitely still active. I actually just exchanged a few emails today with Ciphrex's CTO about adding new features. 
mSIGNA doesn't have hardware wallet support because it doesn't necessarily need it. 
Electrum was primarily a single sig wallet until recently when they added hardware support. mSIGNA was designed from the ground up to be multisig, with a combination of multisig and deterministic trees.
So all 3 signers have their own trees built from 3 seeds. Every address is multisig between the m/2/i paths of all 3 seeds which give you the security benefits of both multisig and regularly changing addresses. 
As long as all 3 seeds are on 3 offline devices, it's secure. This is one reason why mSIGNA is more of an advanced wallet than a basic one. Not everyone can be trusted to use advanced software. 
I'd even say that in many configurations, mSIGNA is MORE secure than electrum since mSIGNA can support 15 signers compared to Electrum's 1+Trezor or 1+Ledger. 
When comparing security though, you can't just look at the tools. The users using the tools need to follow secure best practices too otherwise it doesn't matter how secure the tool is.

NFC is finicky. Here is some background info to help your success rate. 
NFC cards have two antennae: one that receives power from a reader and one that transmits its data.
When an NFC tag receives enough power it energizes the chip inside which broadcasts its data through the sending antenna. Once this job is done, the chip usually goes to sleep.
Sometimes it's possible to put the tag close enough to the reader to power the chip inside, but it's still too far for the data antenna to receive the data. This makes the card appear to not work. 
Also, removing/re-adding the tag too quickly won't fully power off the chip, so it won't know to retransmit the data again. 
Now that the theory is understood, here are some tips:
 put the card directly to the reader in a swift motion without delay. This will ensure that by the time the chip inside powers up and begins transmitting, its close enough to the reader for the transmitted data to be picked up.
 if it isn't read after a few seconds, remove the card and hold it away from the reader for a few seconds. This will ensure the chip inside powers down completely, making it ready to be powered up on your next tap. 
Good luck!

Better wallet?
mSIGNA *is* better than those you listed, it's just an advanced one. It's not for newbs, it's for pros. It'd likely be confusing for new bitcoiners who don't understand bip32 trees, multisig, and manually connecting to bitcoin core nodes.

Nope, I didn't ignore it, although you may have ignored the contents of the email update that came from The Bitcoin Foundation.
The update email did not promote bcash as bitcoin. The email stated that our Executive Director attended the Satoshi's Vision conference to get a better understanding of how that project was evolving.
Any issue you have with promoting bcash should be directed to the people or organizations that are promoting bcash.

Magnetic Secure *Transmission is just a fancy way of communicating a payment card number to a card reader without physically swiping the card on a reader. 
The transmitted number is a one-time "tokenized" payment card number so that if it's captured it can't be reused like credit card numbers can.
It's a fancy technological bandaid that makes new-style tech interface with old outdated tech.
MST is less secure than cryptocurrency transactions because they do not make use of digital signatures like ECDSA that is used in most cryptocurrencies. They would have to talk to a centralized server (Samsung's) to prepare a payment code and transmit that to the merchant.
Any mobile wallet that would be written to use MST would be less secure than a cryptocurrency wallet because a crypto wallet would calculate a digital signature over the amount being spent and the recipient of the funds in a way that cannot be altered or reused. Also, the crypto payment requires no third party (Samsung) to authorize the payer to send, or to release the funds to the recipient.

A digital copy can be accessed without your knowledge by physical or remote attackers. 
A non-digital copy can only be accessed by physically-present attackers. 
If you add a tamper evident seal you can identify when it was accessed, and if you store the cryptosteel in an access-controlled location you can prevent unauthorized access. 
TLDR: digital storage of mnemonics is less secure than physical storage.

There definitely was a lot of people who felt that _both_ 2MB blocks _and_ segwit were a great compromise as it paved the way for the future lightning network _and_ released pressure on full blocks in the short term.
These people agreed to the Segwit2x plan so that their desired 2MB blocks would be complimented with segwit.
Those people felt disenfranchised when the "segwit now, 2MB later" promise/agreement/proposal was changed at the last minute to be "segwit now and who cares about your half of the compromise"
So yes, there's clear evidence that the segwit2x proposal *DID* help the activation of segwit.
And no, I don't think anyone who was pushing for segwit2x could possibly believe they deserve "credit" for segwit. All network upgrades are based on consensus, not the actions/beliefs/commitments of any one person.

Fair enough. At least you didn't twist the words themselves, you just mis-labeled it as a question directed at Greg instead of a general undirected observation.

I disagreed and reiterated that I was simply making an observation and comparing two curves. "The only way people will get upset about what I said is if they misunderstand and take my words out of context"
They both replied "Yeah! Because those NEVER happen on Reddit!!!"

It wasn't a scam. It was mismanagement and theft. 
If you listen to Ver's statement he says Mark gave him bank balance sheets to review, and those showed everything was OK. 
Considering we now know that Mark misappropriated Gox funds into his own/company's bank accounts and hid this from his employees, it's not a stretch by any means to speculate that the balance sheets Mark showed to Roger were falsified. 
Roger's mistake wasn't backing a "Gox scam" because a) it wasn't a scam and b) he didn't have reliable information. 
Roger's mistake was staking his reputation on inaccurate information given to him by a thief and making an auditor's determination without being an auditor. 
He's long since learned his lesson: if you're not an auditor, don't publicize your audit findings.

The analogy does not fit bitcoin. Forks represent divergence in consensus. 
All money is a shared delusion; we accept it because we can spend it tomorrow on what we need. 
A hard fork represents divergence, and split the community into two camps: the left fork and the right fork. Suddenly there are two shared delusions and two communities. This breaks the fungibility of bitcoin. 
A stark difference exists between a small and soft fork - which happen regularly - and a hard fork which creates two chains. One is natural and one is a huge risk

"Bucket shop" is a defined term under the criminal law of many states in the United States that make it a crime to operate a bucket shop.[3] Typically the criminal law definition refers to an operation in which the customer is sold what is supposed to be a derivative interest in a security or commodity future, but there is no transaction made on any exchange. The transaction goes "in the bucket" and is never executed. Because no trading of actual securities occurs, the customer is essentially betting against the bucket shop operator in a game based on abstract security prices. While trading in a legitimate exchange also provides a similar game or wagering aspect, the one distinctive characteristic of a bucket shop is the mimicry of trading securities when no actual securities are traded. The bucket shop's exchange is a fiction, which the parties agree to imagine as following the events occurring in a real exchange. Alternatively, the bucket shop operator "literally 'plays the bank,' as in a gambling house, against the customer."
Prism is not a bucket shop. 
1) Prism isn't a shop, but a smart contract. Only the participants of the prism can interact with it as it is neutral and trustless by design. By contrast, users of a bucket shop give their funds to the bucket shop to handle directly. This does not happen with Prism. 
2) bucket shops don't execute any trades. By contrast, as is stated in the Coindesk article, ShapeShift is currently the entity that takes the "other side" of every prism, and it executes trades on exchanges to hedge against each prism's makeup. Bucket shops don't do this. 
3) bucket shop trades don't actually occur; they're fiction, whereas Prisms are smart contracts that are created, updated (rebalanced) and destroyed by its participants. Each of these actions transfer real value and have real trades executing on real exchanges underneath. 
TL;DR Prism is not a bucket shop.

Hi. 
Michael Perklin here, board member of TBF.
First, I have to correct a quite a few inaccuracies that you made in your post which seem to have lead you to inaccurate conclusions. 
First, while it’s true that Llew (our Executive Director) is a colleague of Vinny, it’s untrue to claim that the entire board has been taken over by BCH supporters. 
I am a technology supporter and believe there is a place for both chains (I support both). Other board members are BTC-only supporters and vehemently oppose BCH, and I have no idea of Vinny is a BCH-only supporter but even if he is, there are a wide array of viewpoints from the board. 
Next, Llew is not a board member and does not have the ability to vote on board resolutions.
Third, your claim that TBF has “a substantial budget” is entirely incorrect, and you acknowledge this yourself towards the bottom of your post where you say that bitcoin has a PR budget of 0. This is the truth. TBF has 0 budget for public relations. 
Finally, while your claims about Roger are true (he IS mounting a PR campaign), that fact has nothing to do with TBF. It would be equally relevant to TBF’s recent update email to cite Elon Musk’s recent work on automotive construction. While it’s a notable fact, neither the man nor the fact have any relevance to The Bitcoin Foundation at this time. 
You may now return to your regularly scheduled straw man bashing.

Hi. "Guy on the very right" here. 
You misunderstood me along with many in the audience who approached me after the panel. 
I agree with you that inaction will not kill Bitcoin. I also agree that careful thought is prudent before making any changes. 
What I said in that bit was contrasting two good/bad curves against each other. 
On the one hand, there's the good/bad tradeoff of choosing a plan to address the block size issue. Having the community discuss 30 options without having consensus on one runs the risk of Bitcoin use rising while the network continues to grow. At some point the use could be greater than its capacity which may drive people away from Bitcoin since it can't keep up with demand. 
On the other hand, I was speculating about a good/bad curve based on a fuzzy dictator like Satoshi who lead the maturation of the Bitcoin network. It's bad to have a central deity control the network, but the good side is that problems can get fixed more quickly because there's a clear command and control structure for dealing with differing opinions. 
What I said on stage (or tried to) was that these two good/bad curves will ultimately intersect somewhere, meaning that at some point, if no decisions are made for a long time, the "bad" will grow to the point where it's as-bad or worse than having a centralized deity in charge of Bitcoin. 
I was not advocating for a central figure to control development
I was not advocating for blind action without careful thought
I was just comparing two curves and commenting on their inflection point.

While you're technically correct, the spirit of what he said is still true. 
Receiving coins at an address (either a P2PKH or P2SH address) is quantum safe (including receiving multiple payments) up until the point you spend any amount of those received coins. 
As you know, Luke, spending coins involves publishing the public key associated with that address to the blockchain which makes it *possible* for someone to begin a brute-force attack to recover that public key's associated private key. 
As long as coins have never been spent from the script associated with an address, the public key is not published, so a brute force attack cannot be mounted. 
But you are right: there are no "from addresses" in Bitcoin. Heck - there are no coins either!! ;)

Side chains don't make sense for a project like Factom. Side chains allow you to move bitcoin off of the bitcoin blockchain and onto another blockchain. 
Factom is about securing data, not moving value. Factoids allow you to publish the data with a cost which disincentives spam.

There are standards. 
BIP 32 is used for key derivation. 
BIP 44 is used for multi-currency BIP32 paths. 
CoPay uses BIP44 but Electrum just uses BIP32 with a basic path structure. Technically the seeds are compatible but they use different subtrees to get their addresses/keys

Yes, but only after coin has been spent from that address. 
A P2SH address (that starts with a 3) is just a hash of the script. Alone it has no information about the script that was used to create the address. 
In order to spend from the address, the script must be published to the blockchain. Once published, the script can be analyzed by anyone which will yield the public keys involved. 
If you need to know its 2of3 in advance, ask the recipient to spend 0.01 coin from itself to itself so the script is published.

Is BIP32 centralized crap?
That's a standard too. It's up to you whether you choose to follow it or support its use in the industry.

It's always a little frustrating when I see new bitcoin services exclaim "Secure!" on their site as if it's their main feature. 
When I choose a bank account, credit card, or other classical service they don't advertise security as their main feature because it's implied; all financial services should be secure. 
All bitcoin services should be secure too. Period.

If their database was compromised, and an attacker has your credentials, he can log into accounts and change the email addresses so you, the rightful owner of the account, receive nothing. 
By taking the time to call everyone who maintained a balance they can ensure that they reach the account holder and not the attacker. 
They told me they were going through every account and it would take a while. I don't know what order they're going in, perhaps they reached the "P"s this past weekend.

It's most definitely a false positive. There are no keyloggers in mSIGNA.
mSIGNA is an advanced wallet; it's a bit harder to use, but it puts a LOT of features at your fingertips.
HD+Multisig lets 3 people create 3 keychains (BIP32 seeds) that only need a single backup. From there, mSIGNA lets you create millions of multisig addresses from those 3 keychains, with any combination of signers. 2 of 3? 5 of 7? 15 of 15? The only restriction is the bitcoin protocol itself.
Furthermore, you can choose to either run your own full node locally to protect your privacy, OR you can point mSIGNA to **ANY** node on the Internet (a list is here:  ) to leverage their blockchain.
It's an advanced wallet for advanced users. The UI will get better over time, I'm sure.

You may be fine. Just don't write to the disks. 
Bitcoin keys are small and would likely fit within a single stripe on one drive. The keys might not be split across both drives. This gives you a 50/50 chance it's on the good drive.

If it's true that Bruce only invited people to support his candidacy for BF board election,
Why did he invite his opponents too?
...or is that just a show to keep up the facade?
Occam's razor suggests the most likely reason to put a bunch of bitcoin leaders together is to help organize a plan for bitcoin to reach the next level. 
By way of comparison... When personal computers were just starting to make their mark... Do you think there were planning sessions undertaken by Microsoft, IBM, Xerox, HP, Compaq, Dell, and others to figure out what the next best steps would be for computer adoption? Would these companies be nefarious for meeting in 1985 for planning how to increase the adoption of the computer?
I'll be direct. Regardless of whether Bruce's intentions were selfish or altruistic (it doesn't matter), the outcome is the same. The results of this meeting will be beneficial to Bitcoin regardless of whether Bruce earns positive or negative PR for organizing this.
It's more important to recognize the results and not the motives, especially when there are no casualties.

Unfortunately, he's right.
If it's possible to prove the way a specific person voted, then it's possible for someone to buy votes effectively.
Without proof, vote-buyers have no incentive to pay $100 to voters since they have no way to prove the $100 was effective in having that voter vote the way they want.
But if the voter can produce an address that allows the vote-buyer to audit and prove that the voter cast his vote as instructed, now money can successfully buy votes.
It should be noted that this is also possible with Helios if you ask the voter to divulge their voting ID (A11 or whatever)

No, there will not be _fewer_ blocks.
Changing the size of blocks does not change the difficulty targeting mechanism, so there will still be (on average) the same number of blocks (approximately 6 every hour)...it's just the blocks _could_ be bigger. For sake of argument, we can assume that the blocks _would_ be bigger.


While this is true, and while it's also true that the difference between validating 200 ECDSA signatures vs validating 400 ECDSA signatures is 2x, the computation and electricity increases would still be negligible... The computer would be on regardless and would already be consuming electricity, so if you count the spike in CPU activity it'll be a very negligible amount over-and-above the computer being on and idle.
Furthermore, the requirement for vast amounts of energy is actually what *secures* the Bitcoin network by making it near-impossible for any bad actor to acquire enough hashpower to roll back blocks and orphan the chain from some point in the past. So while I actually disagree with your point that additional power will centralize things, even if I agreed, having *more* power required to mine blocks would actually be a security _benefit_ and not a hindrance. So that's a wash.


Home networking connections stream gigabytes of information in real-time to homes worldwide so they can watch Game of Thrones and every other show-du-jour in high definition clarity. If home networks are good enough for gigabytes of streaming, they're ready to handle a few megabytes of download as well - probably in addition to the streaming without interrupting either. So no, I don't see a strong correlation between server farms and the ability for anyone to broadcast/receive mined blocks to other miners.


The electricity and cooling requirements for SHA miners already mandate that if you want profitable miners you gotta run data centres with industrial cooling. It stopped being profitable to mine as a hobbyist back in 2012. Now that we're in 2019, the centralization effect of ASICs has already taken place, so saying that larger blocks will result in data centre mining is a dead argument.
Putting the argument with an analogy, it's like saying you're worried about drowning a patient who has already died from a gunshot wound. While yes, keeping water away from his airway would have made sense in the past... he's already dead, jim. Mining is already centralized and it had nothing to do with block sizes.
I can't believe I'm even arguing FOR larger blocks in this post... but it's just to neutrally understand the claim that larger blocks leads to centralization.
After picking apart your arguments and analyzing my counter arguments... I'm still at a mental stalemate.
I don't see how larger blocks *definitely does* have a centralizing effect, and I don't see how larger blocks *definitely do not* have an effect on centralization.
The way I see it, there is still no strong correlation between the two measurements. I welcome being told I'm wrong because it gives me an opportunity to improve. If you see how I'm wrong, please don't hold back! I won't be offended!

It sounds like you're seeing change outputs.
Bitcoin works with "utxos" or Unspent Transaction Outputs. 
When you received bitcoins in the past, you received 4.67 bitcoins. 
When you send coins on the network, you spend the ENTIRE batch in one go, or you chain multiple batches together to cover the amount you want to send. 
So to send 1.0 coins, your wallet will spend the 4.67 coins and send them to two places: 1.0 will go where you/the user specifies, and the remainder (3.67) will go to a new address created by your wallet. This is called a "change" address because it receives the change/remainder of your transaction. 
This isn't an mSigna thing - this is a Bitcoin thing. All wallets do this.

Bitcoin users like us can then identify services that are keeping our funds safe if they are Level I, II, or III.

They explained to me verbally that they wiped all withdrawal addresses for this reason and are confirming information verbally with every account holder who held a balance there before locking in the new/verified withdrawal addresses so they could not be changed by the attacker. 
Now they've enabled withdrawals so I can get my coins out to the address i confirmed with them verbally. 
Your scenario is backed up by speculation and theory. 
Their scenario is backed up by facts and direct communication from their staff. 
I'm inclined to believe their version of events instead.

Yes there is, but it's a hack and there's no way to prevent more showing up in the future. 
There was an old project PyWallet that allowed you to edit wallet.dat files directly. I've found it here: 
I don't know if it still works but give it a go. 
Always make a backup first before you start!

Take the backup of your 2FA token you made when you created your Electrum+2FA account and simply scan its QR code into your Google Authenticator / Authy app on your new phone. 
Then remove the Authenticator from your old phone. 
Very simple process.

Your sarcasm is misguided. 
Erik is an advisor to a company that deals with infosec. His advice is specific to cryptocurrencies - a topic with which he has a lot of relevant business experience.

That’s entirely my point. 
Delaying a payment isn’t a valid solution to the problem of high fees. I’m happy to hear you agree.

You've made numerous factual errors in your post, and your conclusion is equally incorrect. 
Crypto is treated like barter in Canada. It should be voluntarily declared.

Yes. 
mSigna does. It lets you use as many as 16 bip32 seeds together in a HD+multisig setup.

Today the CryptoCurrency Security Standard (CCSS) was launched which I believe addresses your concerns.
CCSS provides an open framework against which any security auditor (like myself or any of my competitors) can assess the security of services such as BitStamp.
Once ratified, services will begin displaying "stamps" or "seals" of approval on their sites that identify their compliance with CCSS Level I, Level II, or Level III best practices. A link to the auditor's report that provides details of the security assessments will also be available for the public to review.
Having an open standard that's freely available to any/everyone to reference makes it easy for businesses to achieve proper security, AND makes it easy for users like you and me to know whether a service is worthy of holding our funds.
Standards such as this are a very important role for the Bitcoin Foundation to support, and if elected I promise to continue working on other standards with professionals in our ecosystem to make it better for all of us.

You should have backed it up when you first scanned it into Authy/Google Authenticator. 
Did you not make a backup? :/

It's likely someone with an advertising campaign OR someone distributing stolen coins to obfuscate analysis. 
When you view the transaction details on blockchain.info do you see a tag on the address they came from? If so, it's likely an ad for one of their products or services. 
If not, thieves regularly try to distribute a portion of their stolen coins to as many benign addresses as possible so that tracking scripts have a hard time following the bulk of the coins. If every address is tainted with a bit of stolen coins, using blacklists won't work because it'll block innocent people too. 
In either case: don't worry about it. There's nothing you can do, so carry on :)

If you bought 10btc at $10 each ($100 total) and then you sold 1btc for $100 to recoup your cost, that 1btc appreciated from $10 to $100 which is a $90 gain. 
You'd report a $90 gain to the CRA and they'd tax something like 50%. You'd owe them $45.

Welcome to cryptocurrencies. 
Every transaction is *always* valued at the exchange he rate at the time of the transaction. Not at some point 3 days later when you are chatting with someone about it. 
That isn't a ShapeShift issue - that's a reality that everyone and every company in this space operates under. If you're paying an invoice with BitPay? It's valued *at the time of transaction*. Purchasing a tshirt from bitcoin.com? The value you transfer is calculated based on the rate *at the time of your transaction*
All of us were new to this world at one point, and had to learn this same lesson. I'm sorry you learned this lesson after sending a transaction instead of beforehand but the good news is you're well-informed in advance of your next blockchain transaction. 
Happy blockchaining!
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:14:45
I can attest that ShapeShift is most definitely not a scam.
If you lost money in the past, I urge you to contact ShapeShift's support team by creating a ticket here: 
ShapeShift does not steal money from its customers. It simply does not make sense to ruin a sterling reputation in this industry by stealing your 0.2btc.
If there was a technical issue with your attempt to shift 0.2btc, the amazing support staff at ShapeShift will figure out what went wrong and either fix your shift into your new coin or refund you the amount that didn't make it through the system.
@_date: 2016-07-15 02:46:18
Yep. Their security "audits" are single-page statements saying the equivalent of "I did teh audit and saw X new coins were created on their private blockchain"
They have videos too of the security auditor. Analyzing the body language of both the OneCoin CEO and the security auditor was a fascinating exercise.

Shifts from one coin to another can fail for a variety of reasons, all of which are spelled out upfront. 
A user could send fewer coins than the minimum amount, or higher than the max limit. These would cause a shift to fail. If a refund address isn't provided you'd need to tell ShapeShift where to return your funds after the fact. 
In addition, some coins require a payment ID or other supplementary data attached to a transaction that the user may have forgotten to add. This could also cause a problem. 
Furthermore, if a user waits too long to send their transaction and the rates change (users are shown a time limit to send their transaction before the rate changes) this could also make a shift have an error. 
It's never a gamble.
It's up to the user to understand the particulars of the coin they're sending and to provide the necessary info needed to shift their coins before using ShapeShift. 
Thankfully every member of ShapeShift's support team is an expert in knowing what is needed for each type of shift and how to resolve these kinds of things. They can help you every step of the way. 
If you've had a problem with your shifts, don't hesitate to reach out to customer support. They'll take care of you.

I’ve heard this argument and have tried thinking through various scenarios to confirm or refute it but I haven’t been able to conclusively do so. 
Can you provide colour on how an increased block size is related to security?

Bitfinex refunded 100% of all stolen money.
If you're under the impression you lost money with Bitfinex, you are misinformed. Take a look at Bitfinex's statements on their blog:

Take a look at mSIGNA.
It uses BIP32 seeds so each keychain is compatible with other software. 
Every multisig address is created from the keychains you specify (2 of 3, 5 of 15, whatever). 
You can then let your users create their own BIP32 seeds offline with mSIGNA, and share the public half with you so everyone gets the same sets of addresses without seeing any of each others' private bits.
Moreover, while its intended to be used like Armory where you have your own QT node fully synced locally, it can also be pointed to ANY node on the net ( to leverage their copy instead. 
It's full control over all keys by you and your customers without having to trust another keyholder

I was retained to analyze their audit reports. 
My conclusion was that while they claim to show proof of creation of coins, there was insufficient evidence included in the reports to verify their conclusions.

While its discouraged to reuse the same receive address for privacy reasons, it works perfectly. 
You can post any of the receive addresses you find in Breadwallet to your blog/vlog and your viewers can send you the funds without issue. 
Note that any of them can watch the blockchain to see how many tips you've received and where you've sent them. If you're OK with this privacy risk then you're good to go.

25 word mnemonic will let you recreate the wallet entirely and reg a new 2FA device, so it's almost equivalent. 
The 25 word word mnemonic won't let you change the 2FA device on an already-configured split wallet. 
Use the restore wizard and when it prompts you to pair a 2FA device via QR code, use your new phone. Copy the secret key (it looks like 12-or-so capital letters) to a safe offline location (or print the QR code itself) for a backup of your 2FA so you can easily change phones in the future.
Don't keep a copy of this QRcode or secret key on your computer!
