remember the posts around Christmas, when everybody was saying "yeah I know it's down, but it's still up 30% in the Month". Well now it's down 50% (monthly speaking). Is it time to panic now?

Americans, I salute you, for having brains &amp; not being scared like Europeans. Buy NOW!

Americans waking up - Don't be cucked like scared Europeans &amp; BUY at the dip now! You'll laugh at Europe later.

what the fuck is wrong with this fucking coin (and every other), who is ALWAYS falling when it goes up like 1-2-3k? Hate myself so much for not selling around Xmas, my 0,55 BTC was over 9k€ then, now it's around 3k€. Goddammit, I'm hodling for a while now, but I don't understand why doesn't it rise again.. or at least stays somewhat stable, so all the other fuckin' coins don't lose as much value.

Personal ATH:    vs. now: 
Note to self; remember to take more profit next time. If there is a next time.

I've been out of the grid for a week and it's almost 40% down. Is it really crashing now? Or is the market being manipulated? I have 0,51 BTC. Idk I guess HODL 'till worthless.
