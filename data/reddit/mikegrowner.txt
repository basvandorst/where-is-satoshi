layers and layers of complexity on top of politics... sounds like its going to be an interesting few (months?) lol
Anyhow, thanks for the info! this beats anything i have been able to piece together via google
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:41:10
great detail... but i dont think im fully keeping up. 
Does btc1 mean Bitcoin Cash? or is that in references to the new fork in November? 
Im starting to paint a picture of this segwit 2x fork coming, but im still scratching my head about Bitcoin Cash. is the NYA behind that fork as well?

Yikes, sounds like rough upgrade options all around. "adding links to their companies"... sigh
Just read up on transaction malleability, i think i may be in over my head on this. 
Is your take that BTC is good right now with segwit and we'll cross the 8MB bridge when we get there? In hopes that there will be a better version of 2x? Or is that the lighting network?
The only reason i even posted this thread is because early yesterday it took 7 hours for my confirmation to happen (three).

Thanks for the detail, its never simple, eh?
So if Lightning network gets activated will that eliminate the need for Segwit 2x? (or are they one in the same)
0.15 -&gt; 1.15 does sound odd, but (and this is where i'm having trouble understanding the fight) isn't that an upgrade? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:48:22
Whats the right decision for the transaction limitation as you see it?
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:17:35
I think i get the view BTC has on BCH.
Does BTC still have the transaction problem?
Is Segwit 2x for BTC the solution?
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:16:25
Thank for the tips, ill let my BCH rest. hopefully this 2x fork doesn't stir the pot too much.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:14:14
does segwit (the one active now) solve the transaction problem BTC has? or does that require Segwit 2x?
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:56:12
1. Does the block size limit of 8MB not solve the transaction problem?
2. What is the future enhancement? (Segwit 2x?)
3. I see what you;re saying, makes sense... but seeing them both rise just causes me to scratch my head more haha (in a good way)
4. I didn't know that about ETH, whats your take on LTC, how do you see it fairing in this whole debacle? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:33:24
The current price would lead me to believe the trend is to split out and sell my BCH, but it rubs me the wrong way seeing how i think the coin is going in the right direction.
You think there is a place for BCH?

1) I personally experienced a 7 hour confirmation time in mind August. So there must have been a problem at one point. I'm being told this was part of an attack but its challenging putting it all together. 
3) So is a possible outcome this new 2x fork comes and dies only for core to introduce segwit 2x down the line?
5) From what i have read about segwit its not the perfect solution from the technical side of things. if at one point all groups agreed to a hard fork why only apply a fix that could have been done on the fly (if there was consensus). To me if the direction of a hard fork is chosen your going back to the drawing board, why not use that opportunity to correct a number of things and position BTC longer term? This is where my confusion of Bitcoin Cash comes into play, to me that sounds like the better option if the hard fork has been committed to, or is the tech behind Bitcoin cash not all it could be? 
For example, lets say in another 5 years Bitcoin continues to getting more and more popular causing transaction problems @ the 2,4 or 8MB range. with BTC and segwit you're toast and will have to introduce another fork. But in the Bitcoin Cash situation you could then apply Segwit in an emergency situation. 
I suppose my question is more around upgrade logic, why go through all the effort of a hard fork only to apply what was intended to be a on the fly software patch?
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:29:44
But the link you provided "bitcoin-mempool-empty-high-transaction-fees-no-longer-required" credits BCH as the reason pressure has been alleviated from BTC... so the transaction problem is not fabricated, just one of the solutions has done its job?
I can say first hand in mid August it took over 7 hours for a transaction confirmation. so there "was" a problem, no?
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:49:18
This may be the part i'm missing.
The transaction issues i saw in August were a result of a mempool spam attack of some kind?
Is bitcoin still susceptible to this type of attack? if im reading correctly did the introduction of segwit 1 fix this?
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:32:13
Wow, great detail, thanks.
Im getting the impression the segwit 2x is exactly what you say, but what are your thoughts on Bitcoin cash? Was that fork tied to this group or does that have real value behind it?
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:27:16
Does that mean "they" could start up any time they wanted? 
Has a fix been applied or did they just stop?
