I second this.  The community needs to know if there is a present security risk regardless of where in the infrastructure it occurred.

It would be nice to see some general details on how the hot wallet was compromised (be it BitcoinD, an insider, bad network protection).  The community is eagerly awaiting to hear if we need to take steps for protection.

* Always take advantage of wallet security features such as encryption and offline transaction signing. 
* Don't leave your personal bitcoin on any wallet that you and you alone do not directly control the private keys to.
* Use multi-signature at all times when dealing with shared, corporate, or mission critical wallets.
* All transactions should be signed with an offline computer and secured operating system.  Encryption should be used on the OS and the wallet file itself.  There's a few pre-baked Linux distributions that do this already.
* Use 2FA at all times when possible. 
* For any wallets on a network computer, ensure the operating system is patched and contains an anti-virus/malware solution as well as a firewall.  It does not hurt to have ACLs and firewall policies at different layers.
* Don't brag or disclose your bitcoin holdings to anyone.
* If any paper wallets, backups, pass-phrases, or seeds are being retained - one should ensure the physical security aspect as well (who has keys/access, is it a monitored location, can it be seized)
* Avoid bitcoin ponzi schemes (HYIP, doublers)
* Use escrow when applicable for trades and purchases
* Periodically test your security controls to ensure validity
* Utilize unique usernames and passwords for bitcoin exchanges, websites, and marketplaces.  It is advised to use a password manager that encrypts and generates passwords with enough characters and entropy.  Passwords should be changed once every 90 days.
* For phone and mobile based wallets, screens should be set to auto-lock after a minute or two of inactivity, and require a password or passcode to get back in.  The wallet application should also use it's own separate authentication/2FA.  This should also go for personal computers and screen savers.  
* For wallets on PCs, do not use wireless or bluetooth keyboards to enter passwords.  These can be sniffed for keystrokes very easily. 
* Always double and triple check the address you are sending funds to
* When transferring large amounts of coin, send a small test transaction of a few satoshis first.  You can confirm everything is correct (transaction, address, confirmation) on the blockchain before sending the large transaction.

I didn't get it.  Sending you a PM.

I may be interested in this.  Can you PM a price and we can go from there?  Willing to pay in BTC.

If this is to be used for offline signing, don't forget to disable the wireless and bluetooth functionality.

Why not offer the option of them paying you back directly in BTC?
