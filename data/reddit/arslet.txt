Some exchanges offer cold storage as well. I guess keeping it in an exchange helps with trading. And I would not suggest anyone to store it on their own computer. If anything personal computers are way easier to hack in general.

1 retweet and 1 like. Yeah that is about how unaffected price is. And you know, price is set by confidence in the currency. I for one am out for now.

That's it. I'm pulling out until things settle (if ever). I have a strong belief in digital currency but the shit that has lately stirred up has made me lose confidence in the way BTC is heading. To much uncertainty and centralisation right now. Hope to see you again soon though!

You dear Sir are of course an exception to the rule. 99.9% of BTC users (now and forever) are likely to use it just as they do with any old fiat, that is out of pocket or using a bank/exchange in some way. At least until it gets easier and safer to handle in the first place.

I'm sure that is what most people who lost a lot of BTC is feeling too :P

I meant in the sense of even having a cold storage? Coinbase has and is situated in the US? Or am I misunderstanding something here?
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:21:51
Then why is CFTC even involved in preventing a Honk Kong based company from using a cold storage?
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:48:55
How does this relate to Coinbase cold storage?
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:35:49
Except the value but yeah thats probably not important dealing with a currency...

How is public verification "just" a thing? I think your are under-estimating that concept pretty hard my friend.
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:01:45
178 actually. It can't hide from time.

And I sold beginning of 2017 because of the fucking drama. Feel like shit every post right now.

I'm taking about one coin. It's run by a chain of companies ask the way back to Romania
@_date: 2017-04-30 08:59:10
It's a scam run by some guy in Romania.

Zimbabwe used free-fonts.com for that font

What if he is actually aiming to undermine bitcoin because he owns bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:36:53
Well he also likes to get shit on

@_date: 2017-07-08 09:51:47
You never heard pedagogical before?
@_date: 2017-07-08 09:50:43
