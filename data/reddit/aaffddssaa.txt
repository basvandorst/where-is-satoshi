How does suppressing the price have any effect on how "affordable" bitcoin is? I can buy $1,000 worth of bitcoin whether it is $100,000 per bitcoin or $1 per bitcoin. It obviously changes the amount of bitcoin I will end up with, but it doesn't make it any more "affordable." You people are all delusional.

Since people are just downvoting without explaining, I'll fill you in: "cheques" is the British spelling (it's pronounced the same as "checks"). Correcting an Englishman on his English is probably one of the main reasons the English love to poke fun at us Americans so much.

So $50,000 per bitcoin by January? Am I reading this correctly? So... nearly 10,000% return in 5 months? You must either be joking/trolling, or have a Nigerian-prince-scam level of gullibility.

Because they're not using bitcoin as an investment scheme like you, so they really don't have much incentive to induce wider adoption. It's just a gimmick for most retailers.

You're still looking at it backwards. The US government has 50,000 bitcoin that they have no use for and do not want; they are getting rid of them... that's 50,000 bitcoin worth of sell pressure. When the US Marshals Service auctions off some drug dealer's fleet of Ferraris, do you think people show up at the auction thinking, "Gee, I can't wait to pay what I would've paid at the dealership!"
@_date: 2014-09-15 05:07:56
Yeah, you said, "You can't divide a bill exactly evenly __*WITH FIAT*__ if you share in a certain way." I gave an example using bitcoin, not fiat.
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:48:50
Bitcoin isn't legal tender (and never will be), so you can't use it to pay someone who doesn't agree to be paid in bitcoin.

A Freudian slip, perhaps.

What about *selling* 50,000 coins in a single day? Because that's what's happening here—it's 50,000 coins looking for a buyer, not the other way around.
@_date: 2014-11-22 15:43:07
Regardless, it's 50,000 coins that are being unloaded, which is supply-side pressure. People are making the claim that buying that amount on an exchange would cause the price to shoot up, so bidders must be willing to pay above the current market price. If that were the case, then said bidders would just buy the coins on the open market. The whole point of bidding in the auction is to get them at a discount, especially when you consider that the price has already fallen more than 40% since the last auction.

Better imagine what? When he says "better," he's not *describing our ability* to imagine, he's saying the thing which we can imagine is something better. He's using "better" as a noun, not an adverb. The way he phrased it is perfectly fine. The way you phrased it would be an incomplete sentence and doesn't make any sense: "...we have the power to *better imagine*."
@_date: 2014-09-15 05:14:43
So basically your argument is "it can do what fiat can't, as long as you ignore the instances when *it can't?*" Got it. FYI, 1/30 is not an irrational number.

Honestly, this is absolutely the worst place to ask for advice on investing in bitcoin. This place is full of bitcoin kool-aid drinkers, of course they're going to tell you to buy.

Three of us share a steak dinner that cost exactly 0.10Ƀ in total... how do you divide the bill three ways exactly evenly?
@_date: 2015-05-02 13:38:35


Different trim levels. There's a $9,000 difference in MSRP between a Wrangler *Sport* (the models you linked to) and a Wrangler *Rubicon* (the model in the original link). The Rubicon comes with larger wheels/tires, heavier-duty axles, heavier-duty transfer case, and just all-around beefier off road components.
That being said, I think it's still a bit overpriced for being used with 64k miles. You could get a brand new model with 0 miles for just a couple grand more. Unless I could talk the guy down to closer to $25k, I'd just walk away. I don't give a shit how much he paid to have the interior painted with Rhyno liner or those custom flat fenders, I think I'd actually prefer it stock.

The solution suggested by Andreas Antonopoulos during his AMAA: Ignore it until it can no longer be ignored, and then someone will definitely probably figure out how to fix it maybe!
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:46:25


Yes, we are all already aware of that. The question asked by the OP isn't how people are going to afford a whole bitcoin, the question was about valuation. The higher the price climbs, the more incentive a holder has to sell. How is it that the most basic mechanisms of price determination escape you people?
@_date: 2015-01-22 05:27:41
Depositing fiat into your Coinbase USD Wallet, converting that USD to BTC, and then sending that BTC to a merchant who in turn converts it back to USD... those are all off-chain transactions that are handled internally by Coinbase. I believe his point is how could it possibly be about "proving the legitimacy of block chain technology" when the entire purpose of this service is to *avoid* using the block chain altogether? It would seem it actually proves the opposite.

Yeah, but that analogy works both ways... you don't have Mad Dog McGee do a couple flaming skulls and a tribal armband while you have the patient waiting for the ER to be prepped.
It's just bad PR to make inconsequential cosmetic changes when people are genuinely hurting, waiting for you to get your shit together.

Then they should have no trouble answering the original question: "Is he going to explain how they lost $5 million..."
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:16:50
What does that have to do with his question? Bitcoins are divisible therefore bitcoin is going to magically make it to a stupid high valuation?
edit: Downvote all you want, it doesn't change the fact that the question was about valuation and not about how people are going to be able to afford a whole bitcoin at $500,000. You people are fucking morons.

Yeah, so pretty much what I just said:


@_date: 2015-08-25 08:40:50
What he said is true, though. We've been reading this "weak hands" and "cheap coins" stupidity for nearly two years now:
* Feb 08 2014 (~**$690**): [If gox comes out with a positive statement on Monday you might never see it that low again. If gox are fooked it could go to 500...and we have no real reason think they are, only rumors from people probably wanting **cheap coins**. Tough call! Personally I would buy now though.](
* Jul 30 2014 (~**$560**): [So what I'm expecting is a small downtrend for a month or so, which will shake out some **weak hands**. And after that, the hype cycle starts again, likely backed by institutional investor demand and because of the way things are progressing in politics around the world, new crashing economies/possible war.](
* Sep 03 2014 (~**$485**): [Dear **weak hands**: If you haven't been hodling for at least a year, you're not doing it right. Everyone who has bought and held their bitcoin for at least 12 months is in the black. Remember, you haven't lost money until you sell.](
* Sep 28 2014 (~**$380**): [It's very simple. If you sell, you're a **weak hand**. If you hold, you're a strong hand. That's all there is to it. [...] I fully agree with OP. The turning point is near.](
* Oct 27 2014 (~**$360**): [Something downward pressure also does is stabilize the price as the more risk averse lose interest in Bitcoin, AKA "shaking out the **weak hands**".](
* May 07 2015 (~**$240**): [We know that once few enough hands hold most of the bitcoins, the price will go up easily and the public will begin buying feverishly. When this happens and most of the selling has gone, a bull market will occur. [...] The market bottom is near.](
@_date: 2015-08-07 21:46:33


Let's be realistic, that conversation would go more like: "oh, that Bitcoin guy tips imaginary internet money." So I honestly don't think taking the tips back after a couple years would make much of a difference.
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:10:34


I'm glad to see you acknowledge this, but it makes me curious why you think bitcoin would ever reach mass adoption in light of this lack of incentive to actually use it.
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:47:34


So places with low financial access, but high internet penetration? Does such a place exist? Most places without much financial infrastructure are countries with corrupt, despotic governments that are run by warlords. Lack of financial (and internet) infrastructure is a symptom of that, not a cause.

Then you have to buy 9k to fill the short, which will nearly counteract the original 1k and 9k short. His logic still doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2015-03-24 17:05:22
That's not manipulation, that's arbitrage... and 9k of demand is still 9k of demand regardless of where you're making your purchase.
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:41:48
I don't know what you mean by "modify a single market's value." It's all the same market. I assume you mean a single exchange, but that's still not manipulation. If you have a large supply of bitcoin available to you at a lower price than what's being sold on an exchange, and then you dump them on that exchange for a profit, that's just arbitrage. It doesn't mean it's a "downward price manipulation," it means that the bitcoins on that exchange were overvalued because there were cheaper coins available elsewhere. It's a very basic market mechanism. That's just how markets work.

That's not the proper definition of inflation. Supply is only part of the equation. If a month ago I could buy a large pizza for about Ƀ0.1, and if today I could buy four large pizzas for that exact same amount of currency... what do you call that if not deflation?
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:55:39




As I said, the money supply is only part of the equation. It is possible for inflation or deflation to occur independently of small supply increases. If the purchasing power of a currency is *increasing* over time, then that would be considered deflation regardless of the supply of that currency.

Right, which is to be expected with a young tech stock whose IPO is barely a year old... the P/E for Amazon is over 1,000, but their earnings are fairly stable and I doubt they're going anywhere anytime soon.
I wasn't trying to hype Facebook as a great investment, my point was that it at least produces value, as apposed to bitcoin which produces nothing. I understand that it's supposed to be a currency and of course currencies don't serve the same function as equities, but in its current form, bitcoin provides very little utility as a medium of exchange and is basically being used as an investment scheme with no underling asset.
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:06:54


True, but the big difference is when you buy Facebook stock, at least you have equity in a *productive* asset.

Okay, so that's not an unreasonable way to look at it, but I still think the actual chance of that happening is much less than 1%. I'm not the kind of guy who plays the lottery, but I can't say I've never bought a ticket.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:19:07
I'm sorry, but that just sounds delusional. How much trade is actually conducted in bitcoin? I mean, how much of the currency's value comes from people actually using it as a currency, and how much comes from speculators who believe their small "investment" will allow them to own a multi-million dollar villa 20 years from now?
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:32:41
I'm just saying, if you're banking on bitcoin somehow becoming the one world currency, there's a high probability that you're going to end up sorely disappointed.
