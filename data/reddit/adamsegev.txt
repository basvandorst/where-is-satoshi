Yep, tried that as well. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:25:55
I believe you are talking about backuputil? I've tried that. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:03:29
Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:53:56
But the key I have IS encoded... 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:34:18
Unfortunately no, I don't have the wallet, just the PDF. I don't know of any other wallet that accepts xEnc private keys. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:01:20
The backuputil gives the same damn error. What's driving me crazy is that I've restored at least 3 times using this very same PDF and same passphrase. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:43:22
Tried. It just keeps saying that the passphrase is incorrect and cannot decrypt. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:03:27
It is scanned correctly (I suppose, because I've used a different QR scanner and it produces the same output as on the PDF). It just fails to decrypt. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:26:55
Not phrases, chars. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:06:15
Thanks for at least putting a smile on my face! 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:36:55
Obviously :) 
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:57:39
Did you ever figure this out? I'm in the same boat.    
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:34:19
Hahaha no sir. I even have a picture of the phone displaying the letters. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:04:40
No not words, letters, like AKJ UUY OPT DEI ERQ M. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:14:17
It's not a master seed. It's the decryption key for the encoded private key. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:55:44
I've made sure it's on English. On.. 6 different phones. :(
I have the original PDF so... No faded ink. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:56:25
Yeah, so I thought.. I still get an error. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:03:52
Yeah, I built it, doesn't work for me. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:22:30
Try to scan a private key... 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:42:38
With the debt I'm in, this is my second chance at life.. So... 
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:58:19
Work pays for the phones, why not :) 
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:26:37
I've tried it. Again, I've restored at least 3 times using the same QR and 15+1 chars. I only have one copy of it... 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:41:44
Yeah android. I've tried a whole range of versions, self compiled and apks
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:57:22
Is coinomi capable of using xEnc private keys? 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:36:36
Are you serious? Please tell me you are joking. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:27:41
You got it spot on. I'm not getting a checksum error. Tried creating a wallet and restoring.. Worked.
I'm baffled. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:32:49
Which old version?
I've tried to get giszmo to help me... He ain't got time for that. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:34:57
Mycelium automatically adds spaces, but just for UI. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:05:24
Use and sell. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:22:43
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:27:01
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:44:35
I'll give it a shot. Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:29:01
Yup. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:39:24


Yeah, scanning the public address shows me the balance.  :(
I've never backed up again, only restored.
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:38:49
 Nah. Not hodl. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:35:44
I've tried every single combo possible. Like I said, this same string worked for me before. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:32:18
Yes, but how does that have to do with anything? 
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:28:17
Mycelium auto caps it. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:39:51
I've tried every version from 1.01 to 1.29 using an old phone running cupcake. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:24:10
Nah, this was the only mycelium wallet I had.
Thanks for trying! 
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:54:24
I'd rather tip someone on reddit. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:29:45
I'm positive I'm scanning the right QR.
I never had another mycelium wallet. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:02:01
And how would I go about doing that? 
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:03:50
I sure do. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 04:33:54
Have you tried backtracking your steps? 
@_date: 2018-10-23 04:37:34
The trezor is broken. I don't have the correct seed. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:34:40
Thanks a bunch! Waiting for your reply. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:03:37
When it asked for a password, did you use the 16 chars? 
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:53:07
Haven't solved it.
