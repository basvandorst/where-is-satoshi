Not true. 99% of shitforks are fine are segwit addresses. The ones that aren't don't deserve to be claimed.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:22:01
Afaik they can but only with the master public too.

Fortunately quantum entanglement was put into place in the latest Star Wars 
Fibre network upgrade.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:10:11
Star Wars came out in 1977. Maybe they were using it all along. The dates are too close to be just a coincidence.

Not talking about signing. See forks like bch and btg
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:21:07
I am talking about child keys. Should have made that clearer. Can child key leakage compromise master private key (seed)
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:53:20
It's really not. The point of PoS and PoW is to secure the network. Lightning still relies on bitcoin's PoW

How does this not kill B2X? When users of slushpool were polled on which they would mine, only 8% responded B2X. Would expect a similar result here.
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:14:01
Are people really that out of touch? [Their response]( to Segwit2x is what caused the backlash
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:57:03
You don't have to buy 1 full bitcoin. Forget about the actual number and just invest
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:03:53
Yes next in Nov
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:12:28
Same guy just mined another one:
Less then 6kb in size

1) Economic majority - a few big businesses trying to control the future of BTC?
2) "Simple 2mb update" - extremely contentious and technically dangerous. Deleting the entire codebase would also be a "simple update"
3). Bitcoin core losing control - to who? From 100+ developers collaborating over many years overseeing the insane gains we have seen over the last few years to 1 main developer with comparatively no activity.

They will follow consensus and not just hashrate.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:14:40
Why would that happen? Certainty = rising btc

Reading is a scam. If everyone can read, the value of reading goes down. Simple supply and demand.
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:36:00
Not likely. Most of his channels have significant funds put at risk. If he wanted to do this he would just open tons of small channels.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:06:46
If Korbit drops out what other large exchanges are even left other then Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-07-11 01:04:43
Yeah looked like a brain fart. PS loved your presentation and your new wallet
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:06:53
So the only real developer on S2X is actually off coding his own 20% premine shitcoin? No wonder the btc1 github is barren. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 22:59:25
Channel size is how much money you have in it
@_date: 2018-07-10 02:40:51
Just tested the software. Can't connect to own node and zero coin control features. Absolute junk.
@_date: 2018-07-10 11:28:58
Guess it was just my disappointment showing through. I love my nano s but hate the hoops I have to jump through to use it as it should be used by default. If only they put a little less effort into supporting alts and a bit more into btc. But that's not where the money is unfortunately. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:25:12
Probably not. Roger Ver has too much say what goes on there and it's not in his interest to implement it. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:42:35
Not quite. By security he is talking about private key storage. Hardware wallets do this well as the key is never exposed. You are refering to the trust metric with regard to blockchain validity.
@_date: 2018-07-01 23:45:47
Just making sure you weren't getting mixed up with internet bandwidth.
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:07:49
Yeah thats just the client. Utorrent sucks nowadays anyway. Adware bloated crap with many better free open source alternatives. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:09:05
I said exactly that in the email I sent to which I received this reply.
@_date: 2018-07-01 22:28:08
Channel size limits transaction size until atomic multiple paths are implemented.
@_date: 2018-07-09 22:47:28
Would like to know the answer to this too. Would be nice to have an out of the box solution rather then using electrum with electrum personal server. Also does it have coin control features?
@_date: 2018-07-17 07:34:10
Didn't he just buy a client. Didn't think anyone owns the bittorrent protocol.
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:21:11
Which is a good thing. People will migrate away from these services eventually. Competition is growing for wallet and exchange services and the better products will win.
