debt is actually a mechanism of getting rich though... unless of course you borrowed money to blow on take-out branded clothing and sporting events. Then yea you probably need to learn the purpose of debt.

He has always been bad at calls. 
- In 2016 when btc was at ~$400 bottom of last bear he was calling for it to go lower. 
- In 2017 at $7k he called for it to go lower and it went to $20k 
- In 2018 at $17k he called for it to go high in bull trap and it went lower.
- In 2019 he call for it to go lower at 6k lower and it did, but then sold some of his hodl at $5k as it went to $14k
He calls everyone else a scammer and bad but his whole business is selling a trading strategy he didn't come up with and educational lessons about it. The irony is that he doesn't stick to this strategy, he often just fomo's into a trade based on his feelings and when the indicators says one thing his feelings overrule it.
At the end of the day he is no better than all the other clowns who sell trading systems, advice and trading calls. They all want to make money from you.

Yea a lot of these guys flip flop depending what the market does, always boils down to 'market can go up or down' and when it does I will react and be right.

Weekly looks bearish. SAR flipped bearish, MCAD falling, RSI making a new low, Ickhi cloud support is down at 5k... sure the daily needs to flip bullish first but they'll be some false signals along the way if this bearishness momentum continues

This'll be a down quarter as it broke a parabolic rise, plenty of time to buy.
