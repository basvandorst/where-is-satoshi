Wow. Over one hundred years. Almost as if the market can adjust it's self accordingly based on slow movements in the vaule of their currency.
Bitcoin lost more value in one week than the dollar has in 50 years -- decreasing 2,600x faster than Bitcoin.

Y'all mf's really think Goldman Sachs and JPM are scared of Bitcoin? This is pure r/im14andthisisdeep material.

You're the same person who told people GE was a *"good deal"* at $20, aren't you.

Banks make billions of dollars every week by trading financial products so complicated you would need a 16 week college course to understand them. They are not losing sleep about the fees generated from sub-$100 checking accounts like the ones you have.
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:11:39
No they haven't. The biggest drop we've seen has been GE -- which has taken place over a year and a half.
You're pulling false numbers out of your ass.
And to counter your 1-5% argument. A lot of times that doesn't make sense based on the crazy fees from trading platforms.

*Argues the banks actually give a shit about your bitcoin and are scared of it because it will take over

It will completely crush Bitcoin without a freaking doubt. 
A.) People need food, rent, shoes. Bitcoin will be the first to go before most stocks even
B.) People tend to not dip into the market for years after a recession. The bull market saw many tumbles from 08-12. Gains were often followed by large sell-offs.
C.) People don't invest in risky investments following a crash. Bonds soar, ETFs and mutual funds increase in popularity. I assure you that Bitcoin will be the last item on the list of things to invest in.
D.) Your analogy makes no sense. Crashes are followed by periods of growth. Every. Single. Time. Stock market has gained an average of 7%, every year since creation. It's a long term bet that you can count on like your dad and your grandad did.

So you're saying because some tech companies lost vaule over the course of weeks (and then quadrupled in share price over the following 6-7 years) that the stock market is the equivalent to Bitcoin which regularly sees it's vaule rise and fall by 50%.
Also your metrics came from THE GREAT RECESSION. You're comparing one of the largest drop offs in market history (over the course of one year) to the weekly price of Bitcoin.
I honestly can't believe the crap you're saying.
EDIT: I should add that Google fell from $360 to $131 during the recession which was in-fact not 5 years ago but a decade ago. Again, you're BS-ing facts to prove your non-existent point.

Probably shouldn't of invested "everything" in a highly risky investment that's been trending down for uh, a full year now.

Are you 12? Likewise, is this 9gag?

I'm even for the past three months kid, as are most people -- I'm acually up for the year. Up 44% last year from my collection of blue chips.
Bitcoin is down over 50% from ATH. It's a substantially riskyer investment that should not be considered a safer investment to the SPY under ANY circumstance.
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:34:48
How much Bitcoin at $20k do you have? Your comments are borderline retarded. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:21:08
Stopped reading once I got to your stock market "analysis".
I swear people into Bitcoin have absolutely zero idea on how the market functions.

I've said it once and I'll say it again -- bitcoin needs some sort of regulation.

Eh, I work in finance and a lot of people who actually work front office on the buy-side say it's a decent look into what happened. 
No movie is going to get it down pat on the technicals -- would make for a boring as hell movie, read a book if that's what you're after. But it offers a good perspective to the severity of what happened to someone whos 14 years old. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:50:32
"downside is minimal"
A 35% drop in one week is minimal? Are you delusional?
I'm not against Bitcoin. I'm against people going out and saying it's a better/safer investment compared to the stock market. It's extremely volital and not really a suitable investment unless you're absolutely ready to lose half of it at any given time 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:23:12
"I'm not going to take advantage of the greatest wealth building tool of all time because it's RIGGED. No, I'll buy Bitcoin which surly hasn't been easily manipulated by Asian governments and billionaires who own more than half of all Bitcoin. It's different"!
@_date: 2018-11-06 13:52:34
Holllly shit you're young. Go watch "The Big Short" and follow that up with "Margin Call" -- probably the easiest way to understand what happened during the crisis. Both are great movies and a decent introduction into what makes the market tick.
More finance books/movies that are really damn good
\- Why I left Goldman Sachs (book)
\- Smartest Guys in the Room (book and documentary, on Netflix. Really, really good)
\- Liar's Poker (book, would recommend this if you like the first two).

Please tell me you don't base your investments off this strategy. This is single handedly the worst DD I have ever seen.

Wonder how many "hodlers" who didn't sell at $16-20k around this time last year feel now.
Simply holding an investment *just because* is insanely stupid. Do your own research and come to conclusions.

You MIGHT want to cut your losses and start thinking about rebuilding your savings.
You could be making 15-20% a year in some mutual fund instead of holding some heavy Bitcoin bags.

Lmao. You think a 6% drop in the market is the sign of a global downturn? Get back to me when the S&amp;P looses half of its value in one day.

$20 says this is a completely fake story written by a guy who bought $10k of coin at the ATH.
Hope this and the circle jerk in the comments makes him feel better.

I mean, you did post about how "cheap" bitcoin was after it came off its ATH.

This happens. You seem like you know absolutely nothing about the market. 
Today's drop is not even in the top 30 of percentage drops in the history of the market. A day like this happens usually once or twice a year. Last year it was in August, year before that it was in June/July during Brexit -- so on and so forth. 
Stocks are indeed, safe investments over the course of a period. Amazon is down today, do you think they're still going to be down next month? next year? We don't know for sure, but historically we know the answer is often yes.

There's a term for that and it's called losing unrealized gains.
Gained less than before makes no sense.

Not sure if this is a joke or not. Debt is fine as long as it's a healthy range within the GPD. We have never even come close to testing those limits.

They ran a huge ad on Snapchat for MONTHS. Acually went through the whole thing, it was very well done and had some good research. I'm sure some 1st year analysts had some late nights making it.

Well for starters, the price of Bitcoin rose so quickly due to everyone and their grandma learning about it.
The people who bought during bitcoins 15 min of fame lost their shirts. I'd wager a vast, vast majority of people who have bought Bitcoin lost money on the transaction.
So what's going to make the price rise next time. Even MORE people learning about Bitcoin? Doubtful.
