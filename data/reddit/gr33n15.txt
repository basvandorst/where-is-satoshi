The same people who will buy your XRP or ETH or LTC. The same people who currently buy things online using Dogecoin. It's no different than BTC. Bitcoin is just the "Store of wealth" "Gold standard" or whatever you want to call it. People put their money where they like and it's not always going to be Bitcoin. That's the reality. If a coin has a huge market cap and people hold/trade alot of it, me as a business owner would certainly think of using it for day to day transactions so long as it worked. Bitcoin has an advantage of being the most known and first coin. Eventually that dies off if innovation, support, and usage doesn't increase. The current state of BTC makes it severely unappealing to a business/use of payment.

Dogecoin does the same thing as Bitcoin faster and cheaper... Why in the world would people use Bitcoin when transaction fees are exorbitant and processing times are excruciatingly slow? Not hating on Bitcoin but the ideology of some of the people in the crypto world is ridiculous. It's like saying why would people use a car when horse drawn buggies do the same thing... Because horse drawn buggies came first... Sure thing

Seriously? People down voting this? You guys are children, you should be accepting to the crypto movement as a whole and not down voting every post about dogecoin or any other coin for that matter. Grow up.

This bitcoiner/dogecoiner agree's.

Logically speaking, i and many others feel more comfortable with whole numbers. The price due to supply and demand make bitcoin only usable by the every man in the form of fractions of a bitcoin and that isn't efficient.
Shower me with your hateful down votes, not expecting alot of fans of my opinion here.

As an active crypto-currency user(DOGE,LTC,BTC,PPC), the only deterrent to BTC for me is the price and supply to the masses. I want to see BTC grow and expand but the amount of people who have hoarded them and the overall supply make it seem impossible. I commend BTC for changing and revolutionizing the way we view money and how we use it but i don't see it as the be all end all. That being said nor do i see DOGE,LTC, or PPC being the "ONE" coin. I am just happy to be a part of history and i will support which ever coin helps forward this digital movement.

Why does it have to be one or the other?
I have BTC, DOGE and LTC i support them all because it should be a cohesive effort to push mainstream adoption.
