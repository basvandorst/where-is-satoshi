You’re an adult now. You need to leave the school yard name calling if you want others to take you seriously. You’re embarrassing us bitcoin holders right now.

You’re not really helping. Learn a little about commerce and finance. Don’t be too empowered because randoms tell you you’re superior because you “invest”, “gamble”, or HODL cryptocurrency. 
This is what scares me. The vast majority of users holding up this currency’s value know very little about how the world runs. 
No idea why they would want to spear head it into a post-apocalyptic wasteland. 
Maybe you don’t. But your tone is not dissimilar to tinfoil hat paranoia. 
What if Forbes has done a deeper research and has an understanding you can’t comprehend. And their conclusion is that you should leave the box and view it from the outside, once more.

That’s not how percentages work...

Gosh. That’s atrocious. They literally stole your investment return. 
Why am I not surprised it’s Ghana.
Sorry buddy. Is there any other exchanges you can use not from your local country?

Agreed. There are already places around the world with “packaged internet”. 
Social media packs
Banking packs
Entertainment packs
Most people who don’t know better or are indifferent attack individuals as fear mongering. Completely ignoring the issue at hand. 
A strong counter argument would be explaining what is the BENEFIT of getting rid of NN?
The benefits of NN is clear. So if you’re against NN, then explain with the crux of your arguments about NN not another individual’s semantics, or emotional plea, or if their grammar rubs you the wrong way.

It’s $250T of true value vs $250B market cap. There isn’t $250B of fiat in crypto. Try selling out and the market crashes by the time $50B is changed to fiat.

No not really. Bitcoin would skyrocket in market cap. Probably to 500T market cap.
Fiat would still be worth relatively the same, given that no extra fiat was “created” to buy this bitcoin. It has global economies backing it. Housing, trillion dollar trade agreements, plantation and farming, jobs and salary, hospitals, education, government.
