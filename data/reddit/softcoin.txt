Many have tried and was out competed. 
And yes you can buy asic miners from Bitmain. They do want mining to be decentralized so they don’t hoard the miners all for themselves. But demand is so high most of the time a restock is sold out in days.

That’s too bad. 
With Bitcoin’s latest refocus to be a store of value, for me, I am in BTC now purely for the huge pump and will try my best to get out before the eventual dump.

Still is the right thing to do though vs knowingly putting users in harms way. Also it’s looking like a hard fork is unavoidable, just a matter of doing one before or after the fork.

Miners are our slaves. Suppose a gold mine had 100 miners and for some reason 90 miners decided to leave to mine in a coal mine. What happens? Production rate of gold may drop, but does it make the gold worth any less? Probably makes gold more expensive since inflation rate went down. Sell coal and buy more gold.

This is getting closer to how I view the relationship is between mining and non mining nodes. 
Essentially mining nodes are like voters and non mining full nodes are like election auditors. When a block is produced, it is as if a new vote is casted. The auditors can say whether the vote is valid and count it or not. 
This is all fine if the invalid votes are low. But if auditors start having to reject 80-90% of votes, then there are bigger issues at hand (may be revolt or unrest is coming). The situation gets worse if the auditors themselves are at risk of getting replaced (btc1 nodes) as the majority can directly threaten their legitimacy.

CME cash settled futures can achieve that pegging :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:10:37
This is incorrect. 
Non-mining node vote is like a vote written on a random piece of paper. Anyone can spin up several nodes cheaply and quickly and get their votes counted multiple times. 
Mining node vote is like voting on official ballots. Each hash unit gets counted once and hash power cannot be faked or added quickly in short amount of time. This is the vote that gets counted just like your vote on official ballot is the one that gets counted.

Wow wall street is really set on pumping bitcoin sky high! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:08:26
I am afraid the boat has already sailed for BTC. The primary use case for BTC is store of value now. It’s the perfect tool for wall st to pump so high that when they crash it, the mainstream public will be so burnt, they will stay away from crypto space for next 10-15 years. We are witnessing the build up to a repeat of the dot com bubble. 
During the 10-15 years of disenchantment, the banks will quietly develop apps and integrate their services on the blockchain. Then they will pull the users back to a platform they control. 
A few of us will see this playing out, but we may not have the means to do anything about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:18:07
The rational course of action should be for core dev to put in some kind of replay protection in the interest of keeping users safe. It’s the responsible thing to do. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:13:56
Don’t worry. Hodling is free. As a store of value, all you need is to hodl.

The technoogy won’t go to shit. It’ll just be back under the controls of the banks and nation states. Similar to the internet technology didn’t disappear, but it became a highly centralized surveillance and data collection tool for corporations and state agencies rather than the decentralized, open network it was intended to be. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:51:50
Bitcoin’s current central point of attack is the handful of coders with commit rights. If I was a state agent, I’d find under the table ways to coerce, blackmail, or threaten these individuals to stay in their position and do my bidding.

I try not to turn to a “leader” group for confirmation when arriving at a decision. Instead I’d like to consider all aspects (technology, economics, politics) and make an independent decision. 
The reason I am not too worried about developer support is because developers come and go. Top developers tend to put in work on the projects they believe in. We’ve had good developers leave in the past, and will have good developers join, because of the direction we’ve decided to take the Bitcoin project. The most important is to choose the best direction for our project, and good developers will join/come. If we pick the wrong direction, then we’ll just end up turning away good developers and keeping the bad ones around who can’t go to a better place.

Other manufacturers have competed and were out competed with this PoW. What makes you think they can compete better with a different PoW. 
Also I am sure there are other miners out there (bitfury), only they don’t sell their equipment to public. Why would they when they can have mining all to themselves?  
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:14:28
Bitcoin is a digital representation of value that can be exchanged in an open, secure, and decentralized manner without needing an intermediary or central authority. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:27:08
Awesome story and thank you for sharing your experience. 
Where do you see bitcoin in the days ahead, especially with bitcoin cash/gold, and upcoming s2x and no2x forks? Will you stay invested with some variation of bitcoin or perhaps see better opportunities else where?
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:47:58
Blockstream wouldn’t as it would be too transparent. But investors of Blockstream could create separate entities that run one or more of these large layer 2 hubs and reap profits off of the small block arrangement. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:05:27
What if miners keep some hashrate on segwit chain to mine empty blocks just to earn block rewards? Then they keep converting those segwit coins to some other coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:06:43
The “dirty work” is actually more profitable though if segwit chain is the higher value chain immediately after the split. The collusion part will actually be to mine the lesser value segwit2x chain even if it’s not immediately profitable to do so, which is what NYA is signalling.

In Bitcoin, think of user consensus (full nodes) as right to protest and miners (mining nodes) as right to enforce. If enough of us mine, then it wouldn’t be easy for a select group or state to take away/change our Bitcoin.

Based on my understanding of networks and network routing, I am anticipating LN will end up being closer to hubs than flat p2p structure. But I am willing to see how the final implementation turns up and admit to being wrong if that is the case.

No, 14TH should produce around 0.003 btc per day. That’s no where near $100 usd.

I am sure many supports s2x. I think no2x support is mostly voiced through twitter, polls and forums while s2x is expressed through hash power signalling. So it’s quite easy to equate loudness to be majority. Anyway, we’ll all find out one way or another at the fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:20:23
Great! Let’s take out the only company that’s still selling affordable ASIC miners to retail consumers. We’d be doing state actors like Putin a big favor in helping to ban mining equipment for general public. Well done.

Yes anyone can run LN, but not everyone has the resources to run. 
An oversimplified analysis (and excluding border conditions) will show roughly that LN requires 2N funds to achieve N times scaling. For example, if a cup of coffee costs $5 and I lock $50 to open a channel, then I could buy 10 cups before closing the channel. This amounts to 10 tx on LN and 2 tx on chain vs 10 tx on chain without LN (or effectively 5X scaling). But to get this 5X scaling, I had to lock in 10X amount of funds initially. The merchant would have to commit resources external to the LN channel as well, since he/she would have to sell me 10 cups of coffee before receiving payments on chain. 
Ultimately the amount of scaling achieved will be limited by the resources that’s required to be locked into LN channels, or alternatively entities with huge resources would have to act as intermediary between channels to alleviate the resource requirement.

Assuming that 93% miner signalling really do mean they intend on letting segwit2x chain survive, then the optimal play wouldn’t be to switch 93% hashrate to mine segwit2x chain, but rather to move 50% hashrate there and leave 43% to mine empty blocks on segwit chain (at least while there is more value on segwit chain). 
This achieves 2 objectives. First is to capitalize on the higher segwit chain price, and the second is to drive down the segwit chain price quicker.

If Bitmain is taken out (either by Blockstream or Chinese gov), then centralization of bitcoin will be complete. Mining equipment and code commit rights will all be in the hands of a select few. If you are serious about Bitcoin, buy miners and start mining asap to help secure the network.
