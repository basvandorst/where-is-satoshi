The price increase became double-logarithmic recently, which pretty much spells crash in the next few days if not today.  I think it'll get close to $400 before a crash.  However, don't expect it to go too bar below $200 and don't expect it to stay down either.

Money has value not because it's useful, but because people trust that they will be able to exchange it for goods and services in the future.  The US dollar is no more intrinsically valuable than the paper it's made from, but people trust others to accept it as payment, so it has value.
The thing with Bitcoin is that not many people accept it yet, but a lot of people think they it will be widely accepted in the future, so they're getting in while Bitcoins are still cheap.  If they turn out to be wrong, then it will be the tulip bulb of the 21st century.  If they turn out to be right, then they stand to profit massively by adopting early.

I'm not the guy to ask about that.  I don't buy them with a credit card.  I don't have a credit card verified with Coinbase.

Generally 5-7 business days.  They need to inform the third party that moves the money from your bank to them, then the third party needs to act to notify your bank, then your bank needs to approve the transfer, then the third party needs to deliver the funds to Coinbase, then Coinbase likes to wait a little while to ensure that there will be no chargeback, *then* you get your coins.
I've seen the funds removed from my bank between 6 hours and 48 hours.  Bitcoins show up in my Coinbase account after ~5 days.
Also, until your first purchase completes, Coinbase will not allow you to make another purchase.  So if you want to buy 10 BTC, don't buy 0.1 BTC tomorrow with the intention of buying 9.9 BTC on Friday because they won't let you.  I made this mistake and ended up paying $30/BTC more on my second purchase than I did on my first purchase because a week had gone by.

Don't worry about it.  It's a learning experience.  Welcome back to $300.
EDIT: I spoke too soon.  Give it an hour.
EDIT 2: (one hour later) Ok, *now* welcome back to $300.

I'd be interested in seeing some stats for people who *currently* hold coins.  What is the average for us owners?
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:52:01
15 coins total puts you very easily in the top 5% of Bitcoin owners.  Maybe even 1%.  I'd wager to say that most owners don't even have 1.  You're not missing the boat - you're already on it.

Yeah, it's not a bad idea to buy even now that they're at an all time high.  Long term, they'll go higher.

This is one of my favorite things about Bitcoin.  Instead of paying Reddit for a comment someone made (Reddit gold), you can directly pay that person.
(I hope it was your intention to give ฿1 and not $1.  That would be a really unfortunate mistake.)

It wouldn't take as many as you think at $2,000/BTC.

If it reaches $2000 I'm quitting my job and moving to the Bahamas.  I do not expect it to happen.  Not during this bubble anyway.

Seconded on tonight.  Once China goes to sleep, Americans on Mt. Gox will panic over a tiny dip, then the site will crash, spurring more panic.  It'll probably get up to almost $400 before it happens.
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:49:00
It'll crash.  You'd be a fool to say it won't.  But eventually it will come back up and go even higher.

Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places.  Who said you have to buy a whole coin?

It is happening, but only a few people have the means to make it worthwhile.
Transfer fees eat up some of your profits, and some exchanges make it very difficult to get your money in/out.  also, with the price changing on a minute-to-minute basis, trying to do this might actually see you selling at a loss, plus fees.

What general area are you in?  My apartment has electric heat, so if you want to run your equipment in my apartment, it wouldn't cost me anything more than usual, since I'll be getting the same amount of heat whether it comes from my heaters or from your equipment.  Maybe we can work out a deal.

You're panicking.  This is Bitcoin.  $50 drops are the rule, not the exception.

Obviously there's nothing official, but [there's an interesting read here]( about distribution of Bitcoin wealth.  Note that it was written over two weeks ago, so a lot has probably changed on the low end of the spectrum with several thousand new people entering the market and testing the waters.
You thought the wealth distribution problems in the US were bad?  Think again.

It's like finding a penny.  Or 1.7 pennies more accurately.

I've had nothing but good experiences with them.  I've never had an order cancelled and they deliver when they say they're going to.  I have no idea why some people's orders are getting cancelled.

It's nice to see that there are still a few sane people on this subreddit.

It's really difficult to analyze Bitcoin logically.  It defies logic.  If you want to try to predict price, your best bet would be to analyze herd mentality, not economics.

If this turns out to be another April, the price will reach almost $2000 before crashing.  This is not another April.

True, but there's a tipping point where there's so much mania that it can't be propped up by China.  I think that now is one of those times.
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:45:22
Question: I just bought a bunch of coins on Coinbase.  It's not my first purchase through you, but I am worried about the "cancellation due to high risk" that I've been hearing about.  Is there anything that I can do in order to prevent that from happening to me?
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:43:24
It's *mostly* speculation.  Some stores (mostly online) do accept Bitcoin as payment.  Ebay and Amazon are in the news for considering accepting it.  I envision it becoming a cheaper way to transfer value, since it eliminates the middleman between consumer and vendor.  It will be used in the same way you use a debit card today, except that the vendor won't have to pay a fee to be able to accept Visa, etc.
