Please point the broken part with the right solution if the information leads you to be able to. I'll send your report to them.
**The Problem**
Suppose somebody (M) wants to implement a MiTM-attack on Diffie—Hellmann Key Exchange between A and B, so that the spoofed shared keys between A and M and between B and M have same hash value (used for key visualization and verification).
Let us denote the hash function in question by H(x); it takes b-bit values. For our application, b=128 and H(x) = first 128 bits of SHA1(x).
Let (p,g) be the public Diffie-Hellman parameters; it makes sense to use the same parameters between A and M and between B and M, which can be accomplished if the parameters are supplied by M (as in our case). Denote by n the number of bits in p. In our case, n=2048.
Now, once A supplies M with its g_1 = g^u mod p and B supplies M with g_2 = g^v mod p, the problem is to find x and y, such that H(g_1^x)=H(g_2^y).
**Birthday paradox**
An obvious approach, based on the birthday paradox, is to scan 2^{b/2} values of x (say, from an arithmetic progression, or by taking powers of two modulo (p-1)/2, so that the next value of g_1^x mod p is computed from the previous by one multiplication modulo p ), store and sort resulting H(g_1^x), repeat the same process for 2^{b/2} values of y, then compare sorted lists looking for the collision sought.
However, this requires O(2^{b/2}) modular multiplications and hash (SHA-1) computations, and, more importantly, O(b.2^{b/2}) bits of memory to keep the intermediate results.
There are several approaches which require less memory, but still O(2^{b/2}) modular operations, this time exponentiation mod p (which is usually a thousand times more complex operation). They use cycle finding in some form.
**Cycle Finding**
Cycle finding is usually applied for detecting collisions for one hash function. In our case, we have to find collision between two hash functions H_1(x):=H(g_1^x) and H_2(y):=H(g_2^y) from {0,1}^n into {0,1}^b.
However, this problem can be reduced to that for one hash function, if we are ready to replace n with n+1: consider H_0 from {0,1}^{n+1} to {0,1}^b, given by H_0(2x):=H_1(x), H_0(2y+1):=H_2(y). Once we find a hash collision for H_0 on arguments of different parity, we obtain a hash collision between H_1 and H_2. On average, one collision in two will have the required property, so we'll have to find two-three collisions for H_0.
Next, we need a projection function g from {0,1}^b into {0,1}^{n+1}, so as to reduce finding collisions for H_0 to finding collisions for f(x):=H_0(g(x)). An obvious choice is to map {0,1}^b into {0,1}^{n+1} by adding n+1-b leading zero bits. This has the advantage of making the exponents for modular power elevation smaller.
So we are reduced to finding pairs distinct b-bit values z and z', such that f(z)=f(z'). We might start from a random z_0, construct z_n:=f(z_{n-1}), and use, say, Pollard rho method to find a loop in this sequence. This would require O(1) memory, but O(2^{b/2}) unparallelalizable computations of f(z).
**Distinguished values**
A better approach, allowing some parallelization at the expense of some memory, is to start from a randomly chosen z_0, construct sequence z_n as before, stopping if a loop is detected by Pollard rho, but in addition storing triple (z_n,z_0,n) into a special table whenever z_n happens to be distinguished (say, has t leading bits equal to 0, for suitably chosen t &lt; b ). Once a distinguished value is reached, processing stops, and a new random value of z_0 is chosen to construct a new sequence z_n.
This might be done in parallel, starting from several randomly chosen values of z_0.
Once the same value of first component in the results table appears twice, we are likely to have found a collision, reconstructing the two colliding sequences from their (distinct) values of z_0.
This requires O(2^{b/2}) n-bit modular power elevation operations with a table for O(2^{b/2-t}) b-bit values. The computation can be done in parallel on up to O(2^{b/2-t}) processor cores if t is suitably chosen. For example, we might take t=32 for b=128, thus requiring several gigabytes of memory, but allowing parallel computation on billions of cores.
**Required Resources**
We still need to compute O(2^{b/2}) = O(2^{64}) powers with 128-bit exponents modulo 2048-bit prime p, and the same amount of SHA-1 hashes.
Each such power computation would require several million clock cycles on a modern CPU core (tens of thousands cycles for each modular multiplication). Let us assume that it requires two million cycles on a 2GHz core, so that one core can perform thousand such operations per second.
A modern 8-core CPU (with hyperthreading, which will barely help us here since the problem is CPU-intensive) costs about 500$ and consumes about 50 Watt of power.
In this way, we can perform 8000 (let us replace this with 10^4) such operations per second on 500$ equipment consuming 50 Watt of electric power.
We have to perform about 2^{64} ~ 2 * 10^{19} operations (actually, several times more — say, twice as much) to find a collision of requested form.
If we wish to achieve this, say, in one month (clearly too long a time to expect the parties not to worry about the delay of their DH key exchange), i.e. in 2 * 10^6 seconds, we'll need 2 * 10^9 (two billion) 500$ CPUs, worth a trillion dollars. They will consume approximately 50 billion kW.h of electricity in the process, worth hundred millions of dollars. Deployment of FPGA and ASICs might lower this estimate by an order of magnitude, still leaving such an attack to be infeasible.
All this to intercept one secret chat!

Whatsapp is a fail imo, innovation wise it's pretty shit.
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:14:44
The report from i posted the costs is from 2015 so it still cost an incredible amount of money and within the means of a very well financed adversary. It's not feasible if you 'just want to prove a point' and those who would be worth it for a 3rd party to spend such crazy amount of money and time aren't even using messaging apps to communicate, even not textsecure, open whisper systems or whatever.

i dont like whisper app u try too hard to promote by bashing others, telegram offers more than whisper. For me its secure enough
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:35:58
But it still wouldn't be feasible for one secret chat, costs would be too high in the hundred millions usd, see my post below. It could be possible but not feasible, even then, Telegram can update their code. For a day to day messenger it's perfectly fine. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 11:10:37
This is how you engage mainstream to Bitcoin, clever approach.
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:54:17
"Overall, I would estimate that a full attack costs in the tens of millions USD in infrastructure and electricity to pull off and get a full fingerprint collision in reasonable time."
Good luck wasting your money for some private chats.

@_date: 2015-07-27 13:37:41
They had a reply on this claming that it would even cost much more that that. There is also a detailed calculation on this.
**Man-in-the-middle attacks**
Telegram has two modes of communication — ordinary chats using client-server encryption and Secret Chats using end-to-end encryption.
Client-Server communication is protected from MiTM-attacks during DH key generation by means of a server RSA public key embedded into client software. After that, if both clients trust the server software, the Secret Chats between them are protected by the server from MiTM attacks.
The interface offers a way of comparing Secret Chat keys for users who do not trust the server. Visualizations of the key are presented in the form of identicons ([example here]( By comparing key visualizations users can make sure no MITM attack had taken place.
**Hash collisions for Diffie-Hellman Keys**
A 128-bit fingerprint is used to create the key visualization. If there was a way to efficiently cycle through DH parameters, an active man-in-the-middle attacker could theoretically spoof the fingerprint.
Our calculations show that for this kind of attack to succeed in one month — even with all possible optimizations using cycle finding, etc. — the attacker would need modern equipment worth around a trillion dollars. And the attack would consume approximately 50 billion kW.h of electricity in the process, worth hundred millions of dollars. All of this for just one secret chat. Deployment of FPGA and ASICs might lower this estimate by an order of magnitude, but the attack would still remain infeasible.
Note that it would also take such a spoofed secret chat an entire month to be created, which is likely to be noticed by the victims.
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:26:54
I don't think you understood the whole point, it will cost billions in usd to pull an attack, it's just not feasible, why would anyone do that? Not worth it, worst case scenario they improve their code, but as of now its perfect for the average user, because not just its security is hard and expensive to disrupt but it has many customiseable features to offer, just look at the bot store devs can add many innovative features to the app like Julia, textsecure is 'just a secure messenger' nothing more. If money wouldnt matter you probably could disrupt textsecure aswell.

You can't expect from the big financial institutions/banks to make something better than Bitcoin because it won't be decentralised. He is just protecting his ass.

What's the point of bitcoin when it only can handle a small amount of users, i believe xt got some attention because some core devs didn't want to scale bitcoin in the first place. If Bitcoin stays like this then many will just see it as a prototype and not as a worldwide online payment processor at all.

@_date: 2015-10-08 17:12:21
And being the 'minority' doesn't mean is doing the right thing either. Building a Bitcoin app that aims to engage with famous social media platforms is actually a great idea and something that we are missing. I bet even people like Andreas and Nick Szabo agree with me where Nick mentioned being fan of Changetip.
For someone who claims to be free and enjoying life, you've spent some time on Reddit trying to make your point. Not just regarding this thread. But you've commented on more than one GG thread. What I'm trying to say is that you contradict yourself. You say one thing but prove something different with your actions. Just be consistent and don't just say things to make a point. If you don't trust GG feel free to stop using it, and also don't feel obligated to comment on EVERY GG thread or topic. Go live my friend.

The guy is all doom.
@_date: 2015-10-08 16:40:15
Or maybe because you make a negative point but don't offer any reason? This is what you posted just a couple weeks ago.


So suddenly you recomment people using the app, i thought you didn't trust it, but when it's posted in r/bitcoin you talk different, doesn't really make sense.
There are already tons of stand alone bitcoin wallet apps, no need for more. We lack social wallet apps, something the mainstream is more familiar too.


I must say that you are the minority here thinking social media is darkness, it has billions of users, thats where you need to aim for imo to attract these users and the majority doesn't actually care much about making just bitcoin transactions, most of the times they actually like more buying sticker packs within the app or using gifs than using bitcoin. Not to mention the app has actually great innovation such as tipping in group chats/ group payments.
You need to ask yourself who the users are, the app isn't only made for Crypto users, they also focus on groups with users outide the crypto community. This was their aim from the beginning. I haven't really experienced issues with the wallet, but apps have bugs that are constantly being ironed out. I would also recommend reading this Thread.
