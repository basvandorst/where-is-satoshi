You don't understand, just because Jihan isn't throwing all of his mining cartel's hash rate to bcash doesn't mean anything really about his motives. 
The profit motivates everyone, he has no option but to mine bitcoin because otherwise he is losing money. 
He still will do what he can to move the dominant currency to bcash since that is what he can control easier.

@_date: 2018-05-04 21:53:11
We shouldn't even be using this website. 
CMC lists tether as being worth 1$.
Is that not bullshit? 
We know tether is not worth 1$. There is only 1 USDT/USD pairing and it does not have enough volume to justify this price.
The bubble starts with CMC pretending that tether is worth what Bitfinex says it's worth

if there is a deep state, his comments definitely come off as someone the deep state "got to"
he basically is pretending that there is no way for USD to be inferior to Bitcoin and therefore it couldn't possibly ever appreciate in value.

I'm talking about USD/USDT.
If USDT is inflated the pairing to BTC will also be artificially inflated.
USDT is not worth a dollar just because there are some people that are scammed into thinking otherwise.

LOL, you don't know
It's just funny to me that you're telling me that "people" call him Bitcoin Jesus and when I asked where he earned it from you just said google it
and no, he "got the nickname" because he was in the media promoting bitcoin, supposedly. I never saw any of these appearances other than him reading from a script that mtgox was solvent when they weren't
He's only bitcoin jesus because he paid people to call him that, and it became his claim to fame. A self perpetuating nickname.

@_date: 2018-05-18 21:05:28
No, again, you literally just don't get it.
If you believe in yourself, you will of course short bitcoin if you say it is "rat poison squared".
That is an extremely strong position to take. If someone is not willing to put their money where their mouth is on such an incredibly strong position, then why should I even listen to them?
Not buying bitcoin is nothing like betting against it. I don't have the time to explain that, lol. I never said he had no way to "bet against bitcoin" other than shorting it. But of course, if it is worthless, shorting it would be EZ money.
It should be obvious to anyone that he is hedging himself by NOT shorting bitcoin. Which again, points to the intensity of what he is fucking saying. If he believed it, he would short it. 
Why wouldn't you short an asset that you 100% *KNOW FOR A FACT* will go down in value? Not just go down in value, but to ZERO. 
Anyway, I don't feel like responding to your inevitable pathetic reply. Toodles bitch.

Sorry, you don't understand. The entire point is put your money where your mouth is.

Bitcoin.com? Who ever used that website?  
Memory dealers? Who the fuck would go to his website for computer memory?
Bitcoin Jesus? Again who the fuck are you?
I have been around bitcoin since 2013 and I never heard of Ver until 2017 when I came to the bitcoin subreddit and saw all this controversy about this guy.
Andreas was the only person "Bitcoin Jesus" could ever apply to. 
Seriously, how many people have bought bitcoin because of Roger Ver? I'm sure they are out there...but they PALE in comparison to someone who selflessly works to further bitcoin like Andreas
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:31:29
Lol, no you still don't get it. 
Not wagering money because you can objectively look at how with gambling the odds are in the House's favor is, in fact, "putting your money where your mouth is". 
It stays in your pocket.
The gamestop analogy just fails, horribly. 
Warren Buffet is not saying that bitcoin has value that is deteriorating because video games are now being sold digitally and how DRM is preventing the used game market. He is saying it has ZERO value. 
If he really believes it has ZERO value he should short it. Because obviously the market will recognize that the asset has ZERO value.
Can you say that Gamestop has ZERO value? It has assets. I wouldn't short it because it obviously not worth zero and waiting to collapse when the markets realize it.
As far as my opinion on Gamestop: it's meh. Decent dividend, I don't have strong of an opinion on it. My position? I own it in index funds. My opinion, which is not strong at all, is backed up by the fact that I have enough belief in my opinion to actually put money on it.
Sorry if you don't get it.

No...there is no market for usd/usdt. Have you even looked at that pairing?
There are two exchanges that offer the pairing AFAIK and the volume is a joke. Its likely all wash trading. 
So no, you are mistaken in thinking that USDT has a fair market value pegging it to 1.
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:14:59
* We spent a tremendous amount of energy on speculation on the Tether issue while they have a system that has kept the peg always. At least let's stop spending the majority of the crypto discussions on weather they hold the reserves after 1 year because we can have this discussion in eternity it seems.
Jesus christ, you started off alright then end with this Tether bullshit. Tether is not pegged to a dollar. It is not redeemable for a dollar. At best, you could sucker someone into exchanging their dollar for your USDT.
Tether is a very real issue. Many people are going to be hurt when it's realized that places like CMC are just propping up its value.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:12:59
Is a hard fork inevitable?
This isn't only a block size question, nor am I concern trolling. I am asking a serious question. I know I am not willing to hard fork for \*JUST\* a block size increase to another static variable. I have never once considered that a reasonable idea. 
But I guess the question does come down to is a block size increase necessary? I am not willing to make this a rhetorical question. I am being serious, is it necessary? I can see the arguments for both sides.  
I know for me personally, I am only willing to deviate my full node from the current consensus to another one if there is a seriously thought out proposal to long term scaling in place in the change. There is no way I would ever hard fork for a static variable increase like bcash 
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:21:21

I didn't realize we had a time frame, or an ideal  usage % of adoption to say if it failed or not.
From where I am sitting bitcoin is still being adopted more...so it's still succeeding in being adopted.

If a different person says, hey we don't have massive adoption in 10 years, adoption has failed, I would also call them a fool.

It's hilarious. I point out that Coinbase is not giving me access to my account (that, honestly, I could have drained a long time ago and not remembered) and apparently I'm bitter.

@_date: 2018-06-13 15:47:46

@_date: 2018-06-14 13:57:03
So...in the face of there being zero evidence that tether is solvent, you will go with the fact that they *could* be? 
I don't understand what there is to even question. 
There is zero evidence that Tether is solvent. The audit was never finished. You even admit that is a bad sign.
Why even pretend like they have any credibility when they cannot produce the audits like they promised they would?
Yes, shame on you. You are "just asking questions" that will lead a neutral party to believe there is a chance Tether is solvent. No one that isn't being paid to do so should do that. 
I don't know about you, but I don't want someone holding a bunch of tether when it crashes to be on my soul's karma.
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:00:10
Yeah I'd say it was pretty noob to even use this company to begin with. The fact that you now have to use a legal court to recover what was taken from you is because of mistakes you made.
I hope you recover funds, but I doubt it. Sorry but you will probably spend money in legal fees and then end up further in the negative. 
Good luck.
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:23:08
So. You don't care at all the sources of the money. You don't care at all to know if fradulent tether was printed before a corresponding USD deposit was made. You don't care if this happened and they then bought bitcoin with it, sold for real USD, and then put it back in their accounts to match reserves.
You really don't care about that? That's interesting to me.
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:26:43
For some reason I think you are saying that Bitfinex is buying your USDT for 1$ each. Am I mistaken?
This is quite different than someone buying USDT from you and bitfinex handling that transfer.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:46:26
but to be fair, it seems like in both situations the fake trading/ tether propped up demand and made it even more powerful. 
Don't get me wrong, tons of people that bought bitcoin want someone to blame. But this seems like a valid thing to point at.

This is not how evidence works. Tether claims to be backed by dollars. It offers no proof.
you: "well you can't disprove it!"
Your evidence of the pegging being 1:1 is CMC. Think about that.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:37:41
So adoption = failed if it's not 100%?
Again this is the problem with private definitions. Bitcoin's adoption is trending upwards, still. Most reasonable people would think that means it has not failed "yet", at the least.
Who gets to decide adoption timeframes to declare it failing or not?
Who gets to decide the adoption percentages to declare if it's failing or not?
Clearly this is a silly conversation, good day.

This entire post was unnecessary. I understood completely what you were trying to say in earlier comments, I think you misunderstood me.
You do not mention the USDT/USD pairing having incredibly thin volumes. That is the basis of what I am arguing. The "free market" is not determining that 1:1 price ratio. According to CMC only .09% of all volume is USDT/USD. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:06:09


There are obviously clever ways to get around this, the longer the market is around the more stable it will be and the more options will come out. I wouldn't ever take a BTC loan out without negative interest.

And honestly, to me, it seems like if Lightning Network really works and has a good UI wallet , we don't need anything more than 1mb. It seems like there will never be a good enough reason to change this. 
Plus this is ignoring my whole reason to own bitcoin. I am owning bitcoin because of the 1% chance that the USD collapses. It's 1% (in my head) every year...so over 30 years that adds up to being a decent chance. Transaction spam isn't ever going to make me worried about bitcoin like those bcash idiots.
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:46:55
LOFL. This is SAD. you gave your self a score. WOW, pathetic really haha.
What you are saying does not make sense. The reserves are not there to 'preserve a peg' THEY ARE THE PEG. That is the only way it is worth 1$ is if the reserves are able to meet the demand to cash out. 
If there are not reserves to match the market cap, it is NOT pegged. That is what you do not understand, at all. This kind of willful ignorance is disturbing.
"but how the system works it cannot keep a perfect peg if they don't have the reserves during market turbulence. "
Why is this true?
I can only assume you mean this is a fact because The fact that Tether redeems USDT for USD? You realize that they don't..............right?
You are hurting the community with your ignorance.

I'll just leave you with this one comment. In this bear market, where asset values have decreased SUBSTANTIALLY. Some coins are down 98%. Why is tether's market cap the same?
If it was possible, shouldn't people be withdrawing their tether to real fiat?

It's okay, in a few years you'll see your mistake. 
Sad that you think you could say im the one lacking logic....when you cannot.
You have not researched the market enough. The artificial pegging of USDT:USD is not based on the free market. The USD/USDT pairing has not nearly the volume for you to pretend its a valid exchange rate.
Like i said, your ignorance hurts the community.

Honestly the funniest part is that I stopped using coinbase before you probably even used Bitcoin. Lol. 
I'm not crying that my fortune is gone. I literally don't even know how much is in that account, dimwit. The point of the matter is that Coinbase fucking sucks and I am highlighting that.
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:17:15
Yeah I figured as much.
If tether was legit, the market cap would have decreased substantially while everyone else lost their shirts.
Are we really supposed to believe that people in crypto are keeping their USD in USDT form instead of withdrawing? Some cryptos have gone down 95&amp;
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:52:46
I believe in affirmative proof. I will believe that Tether is a legitimate institution when shown the proof of such. Until then, with all I know about their business model, I have zero reason to believe they are legitimate. I would absolutely never accept USDT for any payment.
I would accept a lot of shitcoins for payment.

That's fair. To me it's like getting volcano or flood insurance. You hope you don't need it. a 26% chance is decent enough (for me) to take some steps to mitigate the risk, that's all I'm saying.
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:33:23
??? you linked me to the same post. You didn't say shit about what I said.
You calling tether pegged to the dollar is an insult to human intelligence. You are furthering the narrative that tether is a representative currency when there is zero evidence to support that claim. I'm not calling you a shill, I'm just pointing out that you don't understand what is happening enough to have a valid opinion. 
I fear for someone that reads this and feels validated in thinking tether has anything backing it.

I'm not going to go in depth but obviously USD/USDT is the only exchange pair that matters for determining a fair market value in terms of FIAT because it is the only trading pair where FIAT is being used. I don't see how this is confusing to people.
"If I'm understanding you correctly you are saying that unless there is $1 USD in the bank for every USDT issued that means that Tether is responsible for most of the Bitcoin Bullrun."
No, you're not understanding me correctly. I never said these words. I'm amazed you can say that. Tether obviously pumped the price a bit, maybe even a lot,  but most of the run to 20k was FOMO. There was obviously real money getting involved on some level. 
"And as a follow up that for some reason Tether has some kind of special privilege that allows them to pump the price that the other 2000 unbacked altcoins don't have."
I love how you keep trying to come back to this like it's a smart point you're making. I've ignored it because it's pretty dumb. How many stable coins have a big exchange propping them up? 
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:47:32
My theory? you are legally required to spend USD to pay your taxes. It's nice you can pretend that doesn't affect your decision making process and pretend it's your choice, haha.
What other options exist for day to day commerce in America? You can argue that alone validates your point, since there's no underground black market demand for a different currency, but the fact remains that you use USD because everyone around you uses it because the system is setup to facilitate this. 
But I do love how you speak for most of America.

When I say "paper wallet" realize I am just talking about a physical representation of the keys, could be stamped brass or whatever. The point is that it is not digitally available. 
For the most serious 'life savings' key I have, I generated the keys offline by hand. Buried in the ground in multiple spots. 
The rest of my wallets I have a special purpose PC that has never been on any network. It will never be on any network. Ever. This PC I use to generate keys through bitcoin core. It's fairly easy to do so just using console commands, 5 minutes of google can help you for that. You can then generate a QR code that a hand scanner or similar device can use to copy the public key to another computer if you don't want to copy it by hand. 
The private key can then be stored digitally, printed out, etc. These all open their own safety concerns of course. I assume anyone reading this far would have already some idea of those concerns. I have a printed out copy of many pre-made wallets for when I want to use them.  Yes, they are stored in a hidden safe. Yes, the printer was not a network enabled printer. Yes, the printer is not connected to online devices. Yes, the printer does not have a local hard drive for storing spool files. 
Anyways, the key to the Offline PC is to maintain the air-gap. It will be used to generate the raw transaction data that is necessary to transmit to the network. You maintain this airgap by the hand scanners to transmit the address key/signed public key when it is necessary. 
Realistically, you will need two hand scanners. The reason for that is part of the greater theme here - anything that is EVER connected to an online computer can NEVER be plugged into the offline computer - AND MOST DEFINITELY cannot ever go back to the online computer if you were to do that. I think you should be able to understand why.
If you are really trying to protect your shit you will go to the extreme lengths to do so. I am always trying to improve my methods. I'm sure someone will tell me that a hardware wallet with a duress password is better, but I'll just cut that off by saying I don't like trusting someone else's hardware

Yeah, no. Paper wallets are just fine. This is fud.
If you want to educate noobs to the downfalls that is one thing.
Some people have taken serious security steps to generating their paper wallets. I generated mine by hand, never even been on an offline computer. 
Please be more complete in the future.  Giving a small part of the story does not help anyone.

The only reasons to buy bitcoin is to hedge against the us government confiscating your assets, dollar inflation, stock market crashes etc. See it for what it is, an non confiscatable, uninflatable currency.
With that being said I would be very surprised if in 3 year the price of bitcoin is lower than it is today.

No, I believe you came in here like an asshole calling me an idiot because I gave my opinion on how I am treating it in my portfolio. Maybe you should try and understand why I value bitcoin. It has extremely little to do with the amount it's worth in USD. 
You are the one that is deciding how and what a currency needs to be and how I need to use it. 
Honestly, you come off really unintelligent.
I think you should tell all the central banks that they are using gold wrong by hoarding it. Unless you're gonna just cop out and say gold isn't a currency, or something.

....the USD is decreed by the government as legal tender. 
You can google fiat currency if you are interested how that is different than monopoly money.
Any state/bank issued currency back then was not fiat because it was actually linked to something else. 
States did not make new fiat currencies. They issued IOUs tying them to something else.
I won't resort to name calling like you did, but you are just wrong. Fiat money is intrinsically worthless (or atleast very very close to), not backed by anything. The only reason it has value is because of government decree.
Unless you want to say that monopoly money is fiat money, also.
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:56:31
Here's a pro tip, if you are starting a sentence with "so you are saying" you are going to be misrepresenting what someone said and building a strawman.  I never said that.
USD became truly a fiat currency in the 70s. Before that it was still largely a representative IOU note. FDR outlawing private ownership of gold effectively made USD a fiat to US citizens. Under breton woods it was still a representative IOU note that was backed by something.
Again, you are misconstruing representative currency and a fiat currency.

I understand the point of it, and the origins.
My point is that the HODL meme is likely a negative thing. It is funny, I thought the thread was an absolute classic.
"im a bad trader and i KNOW im a bad trader". Classic shit.
But if someone is about to panic sell, telling them not to is only going to delay it. They obviously are too leveraged and don't know what the fuck they are doing if they are that panicked.  
We need to have more reasonable discussions on what bitcoin is, what your timelines need to be, how much of your portfolio to invest. 
One of my friends does not make much money but he put in 300 dollars into bitcoin - even for him that's a lot of money, but with this downtime he hasn't said "damn maybe I should sell" because I've explained to him how the timeframes with bitcoin should be looked at. Even though it's a lot of money to him, he's still not hurting that bad. He wasn't putting in rent money trying to make a quick 10% profit like some of my retarded friends that make 70k+.
I don't know you allergygal, I don't know how long you've been in bitcoin. Me, I lost coins in mtgox. I have perspective because of that. I am FULLY aware that bitcoin could crash waaaay lower than 6k. I don't even sweat this. This is nothing...for me to legitimately be worried about bitcoin it would have to drop to 3 digits again. Even then, I'd have to be worried for a particular reason besides market forces.
The whole reason for me to own bitcoin as an asset is to hedge against inflation, hedge against a possible tyrannical government, and to shield my assets from a divorce/lawsuit/crazy IRS shit, what have you.
None of those reasons are short term, as you could tell
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:00:53

@_date: 2018-03-30 14:05:32
no i don't see any issue with a currency gaining acceptance and the people that own it wanting to keep onto it
If bitcoin actually is a better currency than the others, why would they want to exchange their bitcoin for a different currency? Frame the question like that and it makes no sense.
If you look at the reasons why I place significant value in bitcoin it is not simply because I can use it as a USD replacement to buy coffee. It also has nothing to do with the USD value people place on it. 
If bitcoin stayed the exact same price it is today in 10 years I would still be happy with it. Well, i'd be pissed I lost value to inflation i guess, but I would think you get my point.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:27:42

The reason why I think the HODL meme is not great for bitcoin is that you shouldn't need to remind people to do that.
If someone is only holding an asset because of a meme, they do not understand why it has value. It means that eventually they will panic sell. triggering other HODLers to sell, which cascades. 
If you are not okay with bitcoin being the price it is now in 3,5,8 years then you need to re-evaluate why you own bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:04:00
Like what do you want me to say? That the miners should blacklist the addresses satoshi owned?
Again, permissionless currency.

If Jihan Wu's cartel all switched 100% to bcash, though, it wouldn't make bcash bitcoin. 
Because they won't switch to 100% bcash...because the USER BASE is not there. There is no economic incentive for them to do it, so they don't.
It all comes back to why someone is mining bitcoin, and it's for rational selfish reasons. You maximize your profit by mining what the market dictates has value.

Moore's observation would cover the hard drive storage concerns if you inaccurately apply his findings to that
Moore's observation would have nothing to say about the bandwidth/latency concerns for a global distributed network

Litecoin is useful in the sense that it should be atleast somewhat tied to bitcoin's price, so it should also see positive trending with bitcoin adoption. It has value for every reason bitcoin does but it's less rare and with less of a network currently

It is *far* closer to stealing than you want to admit.
They forced them to sell their gold for a price they deemed sufficient.
Imagine the government telling you to sell to them every bitcoin you own for 1$ each.

I could have been more clear, but I never disagreed with you.
It would have frustrated me if I read someone saying "the marginal utility can be rounded down to zero" because that is just....ignorant. People do make that claim though. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:17:46
i think it can be boiled down that i trust the community to be greedy and therefore do the best thing for bitcoin, they will not adopt something put forth by the devs that hurts us
it's almost like a herd immunity given from healthy greed

@_date: 2018-04-27 14:18:42




then he has even less of a point. he is absolutely misguiding people by calling bcash the real bitcoin. it's not, and likely never will. the flippening would have happened by now. the market has dictated that bitcoin is bitcoin.
Moore's law applies to the density of transistors in a given space. It has nothing to do with storage capacity. Moore's law is not even a true law, it is really an observation. It likely soon will no longer be true.
Hard drive space is far from the only concern. To even state that hard drive space is the main concern is an infantile approach to the issue. Bandwidth data limits and network latency have absolutely nothing to do with the cost per TB for storage.

I literally never said to not run a node. I run one for all the reasons we all know about.
I think you need to read what I posted in response to. I answered why people say there is no benefit to running a node, because of the marginal utility angle. I mentioned that they clearly are forwarding an agenda to round that marginal utility to zero.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:17:17
I'm not giving any authority to miners. I am pointing out that their rational selfish self interests will be served by mining the real bitcoin, as decided by the user base.
That's hardly controversial. I feel like you just saw my post as disagreeing with yours so you feel the need to disagree also. I simply pointed out why the mining power does follow the real bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:34:04

What they did was fucked up and evil. It is extremely close to stealing.

Lol, I don't think you understand what I am saying.
The marginal benefit that an additional node adds is very minuscule at this point. Obviously when a network has 100 nodes a single additional node adds a lot more marginal benefit than when there are 100,000 nodes.
I said people that have an agenda round this small marginal benefit to zero, because they have an agenda.
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:47:38
Lol. I recommend you read the OP I responded to.
"Why do people say that running ones own full node with zero hashing power do nothing to secure the network?"
I responded by pointing how the "full archival nodes do nothing to secure the network" crowd are pushing an agenda. I don't know what to tell you, keep up in the future I guess.

"The USERBASE has not switched to bcash, so they won't switch to mining bcash 100%" 
if you really can't follow
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:36:06
I think this is pretty similar to the flat earth non sense
There is a clear consensus to what is true. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Earth is not flat.
It's just annoying when the 1% try and argue otherwise. The mental gymnastics they have to preform are annoying to even read let alone respond to like it's an argument worth taking seriously. I'm just glad they have their own subreddit.
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:37:31

Makes sense to me. Bitmain having 99% of the hash rate (obv exaggeration) doesn't change the protocol of the full node I am running.

forcing people into deciding to spend their assets now because in the future they know it will inflate and be worth less than it is now is not a good thing
people should be making the economic decisions that they want to make, not because of some constraint that their currency (and by extension, their cumulative labor) places on them
Me wanting to buy a donut should have more to do with me wanting the donut than the fact that in the future this donut will cost me more
and besides, negative rate bitcoin loans are possible. it's not like we can't think of clever ways to implement that.

@_date: 2018-04-27 16:32:02
I think this is a case of the tail wagging the dog
The reason the miners would switch to Bcash over Bitcoin is because the users have, and the values in fiat have made the miner's rational self interest mine the more valuable coin
@_date: 2018-04-13 04:05:37
You didn't follow the conversation.
If there were 40 nodes and I decided to start another node, it will for sure benefit everyone.
They benefit because now the network is 40+1. The network just got marginally more decentralized. The block chain was saved across an additional location for further redundancy. 
This is always true.

Lol. "i guess you're new here"
Once a bitcoin transaction is sent, it is permanently gone. That is unrecoverable. 
This shouldn't need to be explained.
BTW, you are trusting the hw wallet with generating your private keys. I wouldn't do that. I generated mine by hand.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:23:54

TamponShotgun made a valid point. Most people are not willing to risk their wealth in a crypto that is unrecoverable if stolen and not insured

You're talking non sense. You intentionally misrepresented what I said to appeal to some weird victim mindset, or something. Just because you feel someone disagreed with you doesn't mean you are allowed to quote out of context.
"If Jihan Wu's cartel all switched 100% to bcash, though, it wouldn't make bcash bitcoin. 
Because they won't switch to 100% bcash...because the USER BASE is not there. "
Clearly this means that the reason the hash power is not there is because the users have decided that the real bitcoin is still bitcoin.
I don't know how to more clearly explain this.
If bcash was the real bitcoin, the users would have flipped. the values in fiat would be flipped. the hash power would also have flipped.
I never "gave authority" to miners. You need to read better, or at the very least ask for clarification if you are confused..
