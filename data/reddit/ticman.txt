Check coinspot.com.au, it's what I'm using to buy and sell.

The steering wheel might be on the wrong side of the car and the planet for you as I'm in Australia :)
I'll PM you a link to the ad in case you're here anyway

I'm selling my VW Polo GTI and put in the ad will accept BTC for payment.. Haven't had any enquiries yet :(

At least the steering wheel is correct though! :D

I thought it was just blocking POLi as a payment option? I read BPAY and DD were still OK (to Coinspot at least).
I'm not surprised really, you have to give a third party your internet banking username and password to do the transfer..

Ah ok, I know when I use it with my bank, Suncorp, it asks for username and password for my internet banking.
The only time I've used POLi was to deposit into Coinspot.
Lately I end up using Coinbase to buy LTC using my Visa debit and then sending to Coinspot to sell. The fees eat up a little but it's not long before whatever I buy goes up a little to make up the lost amount.

The use case of Bitcoin is a currency, you swap it for goods and services. 
I've been toying with the idea of accepting payments in BTC for my company (.NET development focused on Umbraco, mobile apps and ironically integrating credit card payment solutions).  The piece holding me back is that not many of my suppliers or sub-contractors are interested in taking payment in BTC yet.
I'd end up accumulating BTC which is great, but then cashing it out to currency to live off. I'd rather look at using it to pay people.
Use case for block chains are a different story though, there's some really cool things happening out there like Ethereum, Power Ledger, etc.

Working only on the clone, including booting Windows is the first thing to do.
I'd start by opening a cmd prompt as an adminstrator, going to C:\ and doing a search across the HDD for the file name.
1. Search command prompt in the start menu, right click and select Run as Administrator.
2. Type "cd \"
3. Type "dir *wallet* /s"
4. Pray it shows up!
Above everything, only use that cloned drive!
What wallet software were you usin?
