I am currently based here and funnily enough there is not that much scare factor that is perceived in the West.

Yes. Antshares or (Antcoins) is just one of them and is not directly linked to the govt. Antshares haven't been doing that well since it launched last week and Alibaba are collaborating with Onchain (Onchain are the creators of Antshares, which is a Digital Asset protocol) for a blockchain-powered email evidence repository. I think they are using the Antshares technology for the project. But again this isnt bitcoin, this is just coins that fuels a system for a larger purpose

If they try control the exchanges to limit the amount of bitcoins people can transfer outside the country, then it could probably mean china's role in bitcoin would be less centralised. In 2013, China barred financial institutions from dealing with Bitcoin, and if these sources are true and that they can limit exchanges then they might hit hard on miners soon. I dont think this will happen though, bitcoin is outside the realm of their control

In the long term its better, he goes on borrowing, debts of U.S. increase and slowly slowly fiat currencies will be worth less and less, living off the central banks life support machine

China is hugely supporting Blockchain and regards to Bitcoin in particular, the authorities still allow people to exchange it.
