Dude i call bulshit. Im a college student (22). Senior. Paid for my community college. Paid for my university credits working internships, and night job on the weekend. Invested in crypto and made great money. The fact that you said you are able to save just proves your parents pay for 100% of your shit and you dont even know your privilege. Nothing wrong with it at all. Just count your blessings day by day.

The man did make two top 10 crypto currencies and the first large scale exchange for bitcoin. Is he to blame for the failure? No. The claim is a little conspiracy theory. He has done harm. if you want to say that but he did WAY more for the space than other founders....

Macro-econ lesson for you. Retards still dig into ground for valuable asset but the return on investment leaves the entire environment in dust. Replace that with a better alternative and what becomes environment A resulting from asset B. Asset A turns to what when Asset B becomes what? A is old B is new...get with the program you old head
