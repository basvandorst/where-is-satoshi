They did cancel the dollar withdrawal request and I did withdraw the coins successfully.  
Just won't be able to use bitstamp again.

It doesn't make sense.  Do a full KYC, that makes sense.  Asking me to prove the source of every coin I ever traded is far beyond any existing KYC requirements in the financial world.  
I provided all the original information they requested.  They continued to ask for more such as my personal wallet.

Bitstamp: The new Goxxing?

It doesn't make sense though.  I understand the need for KYC and was already verified.  But to ask me to sign my "most used personal wallet" goes beyond that.

They told me it was because I hit a volume limit, though I don't know what that limit actually was.

Because I didn't have proof of receipt for the source of every coin I ever traded on their platform.  In their words *"We kindly ask you to send us a signed message of your personal, most used wallet so we can establish the veracity of your statements."*

Never said the coins couldn't be recovered.  Actually stated that the withdrawal was canceled and was able to withdraw coins.  
I wouldn't have used bitstamp if I knew these measures were even in place because I was already verified.  Was sandbagged by requirements bitstamp never informed me of.

Wasn't trying to spread FUD but wanted to make others aware that to withdraw dollars they could have to prove where their entire trading volume came from.  I could prove where I bought the current coins (because it was recent) but that wasn't enough.
I've never said, nor think that Bitstamp is insolvent.

You were asked to prove the source of every dollar you ever used on paypal?  And then provided all your employment cheques and banking statements to prove it?
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:03:20
Pretty much have to now.

What other proof would you want?
