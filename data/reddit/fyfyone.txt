Has someone written an article about why you shouldn't own a dollar yet?
Featuring: The money making machine can be hacked, linking to a story about banking costumers that were subject to phishing attacks.

If I got this right, all they want to hear is a quote from Satoshi who said the 1MB limit is only temporary. That is why they think their chain, which increases this limit to 8MB, is the "real" Bitcoin. on the other hand, says this would only lead to more centralization because smaller miners would not be able to keep up with the storage space necessary. This subreddit is therefore focused on finding other scalability solutions.

S2 had Odin right? So it should be pretty easy to install TWRP and delete the gesture file.

Just to be safe, you may want to disconnect your bank account from Coinbase. I have read about people having negative balances which they want you to pay for...

I had a better deal. Once, a weird platform told me 1 USD = 0.87 USD. That was defenitly the best deal ever.

Get TWRP from [the device-specific teamwin.me page](
I think the first part of the [LineageOS install guide]( (up until "Install LineageOS from recovery") should help you installing it.
In TWRP, dismiss the prompts (you will not need to write on the system partion) and open "Advanced"&gt;"File Manager". Open /data/system and copy "gesture.key" to "/sdcard". Reboot to system, your lockscreen should be gone.
If it is not gone, boot to recovery again (Power off, hold Power + Home + Vol Up) and look for other .key files in the /data/system folder that sound like they could contain your lockscreen.

Edit: It will be saved to your device that it has been modified, this voids your warranty but it has probably expired by now anyway. Edit1: Typo.

From what I've read, Coinbase has pretty bad costumer support. Please move your coins out to a cold storage ASAP.

How can a miner specify their address? Do they just mine a block and include a transaction with no inputs? But how do they generate it?

I've seen two PayPal ads, two times each, directly after each other. They told me I could easily pay back a friend with them.
Them: PayPal can do that.
Me: Bitcoin can do that. FTFY

When I wanted to withdraw, I actually just donated my ~1$ to mozilla and went to the delete account page. There was still a not really noteworthy amount of Bitcoin left on my account so I told them to send them to my other wallet. Then they actually gave 0.0001 BTC (0.1 mBTC) to me and instantly sent it to my wallet.
Best part was when I checked on the blockchain they had actually paid over 2$ in transaction fees. It got a confirmation the very next block.
