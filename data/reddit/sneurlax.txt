You won't be private if you go BTC-&gt;ShapeShift-&gt;XMR-&gt;ShapeShift-&gt;BTC.  You won't be private if you go BTC-&gt;ShapeShift-&gt;XMR-&gt;XMR.to-&gt;BTC, but you'll be *more* private than the former.

No, it's not the same, especially if you use any centralized service for the conversion.  There will always be a link.  But your country may not be able to trace payments as well as, say, the US, UK, Germany, France, etc. etc.

The difficulty is that a malicious client can be constructed that disregards the good intentions of the protocol in lieu of peeling back layers maliciously.  Forcing clients to connect to random peers--which would negate the effectiveness of saturation attacks--is a legitimately difficult problem.

I didn't propose a solution, I proposed thought and suggested an effect of using a national fiat currency.
Although the man was incredibly evil and it certainly doesn't do anything to help my argument in the image department, Osama bin Laden concluded that citizens of democracies (as voters and taxpayers) are culpable for the "crimes" of their government and thus terrorism against civilian targets in the US was justified under his code of war.  Now, again, I'm not saying that that's right and I definitely think that using Osama bin Laden as a source in favor of my argument could be a very bad idea...  But my thought isn't new, at the very least.
We are all responsible for the actions of our government to some degree unless we are genuinely doing the best we can to change those actions.

Any service that uses bitcoins, however, encourages the growth of the bitcoin market in the same way that use of the dollar encourages the growth of the dollar market--which is headed by the United States Federal Reserve and, by extension, the USG.
It is exactly in line with my argument if you take the time to step back for a second and consider it.
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:38:56
It doesn't just apply to meshnets, but rather allows for members of relay networks (like onion routing protocols, for example) to reward content providers (even if they're not the source, but rather just a relay/proxy) *intrinsically* -- that is, a guaranteed, decentralized (set purely by the market) payment per bit transferred.
For example, this posits a solution to the current disparity between tor users and those that (charitably) run nodes.  In a greater sense, it will help level out the ratio seeds to leeches by providing tangible returns to seeders.
Personally, I would like to see rewards for bandwidth come in the form of preferred routing (as in the eigenspeed proof.)

They're incredibly low-tech, but I'm starting from square one as far as fabrication equipment is concerned.

"Literally zero" is simply wrong.  You might have an interesting argument in there, but "literally zero" simply isn't it.
Does paying in bitcoin do *more* for its market growth?  Certainly.  However, the ability to convert BTC to a fiat currency is valuable.  From a chicken-and-egg perspective (animations aren't needed here, but metaphors might help you, eh?), BTC may never have become so popular and may never become more popular unless it is practical to convert between currencies quickly.
If you'd like to agree that it's far better for bitcoin for end users to deal with it / businesses accept it, then yes, of course I will agree with that.  It's certainly the best way to encourage growth.  But you are at least exaggerating that BTC-&gt;USD conversion systems do "literally nothing" for BTC.

Personally I highly doubt that you would play such a dangerous game with a protocol you are so clearly devoted to... right?

There is no usable code, but a similar payment layer called ström (or stroem) exists and powers the microtransaction service called StrawPay.
The lightning network envisions "bundling" many relatively small transactions in large chunks and then resolving how those coins are ultimately distributed in a layer that's separate from the main bitcoin blockchain.

Unconfirmed transactions have *worked.*  If I see someone transfer me bitcoins from their official-**looking** Breadwallet, Blockchain, Mycelium, Multibit, Armory, *whatever* app on their phone, laptop, etc., I can/could generally trust it.

Every time I have been able to "trust" a zero-conf transaction based on the protocol in place.

It has a lot more options, especially the feature of having deterministic wallets that can be easily backed up onto paper -- that is, the wallet can be regenerated using a short string of letters (kind of like a seed) or a QR code that is easier to stick in a safety deposit box than a long text document that has to perfectly re-entered by hand.

| Millions of people all acting in their own self interest is far far more reliable than an algorithm that someone will find a hole to exploit.
How does this mechanism not meet that criteria?  Millions of people would still be acting in their own self interest in order to change the rates, the change would just be delayed in order to protect people who aren't invested in the currency any more than it allows them anonymity and security.

Separate yourself from BitCoin, if you will; suppose that this mechanism would be a feature of an entirely new cryptocurrency (I think that, practically, it would have to be this way - too many people profit without adding productivity to the system by preying upon market whims.)  How would this mechanism not serve the interests of people that are interesting in utilizing the anonymity and secured provided by a cryptocurrency
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:29:58
As for wallets - I like coinbase and blockchain.info, but only use those for "hot wallets" (active buying/selling)
I definitely recommend Bitcoin Armory for a computer (even an offline!) wallet
The account amount is stored in the blockchain - the blockchain is the basis of bitcoin and is a public ledger of every bitcoin transaction (ever.)
A ticker chows the current exchange price of bitcoin.  Look at bitcoinaverage.com and bitcoinity.org/markets
100% anonymity is hard because bitcoin is merely pseudoanonymous - eventually your bitcoins will be linked through an exchange (or wherever you trade a national currency for bitcoins.)  Mixing is a good way of protecting your identity.  Look at blockchain.info's "shared send" feature or the Bitcoin Fog.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:11:19
Your wallet contains an arbitrary amount of addresses because that's how the system works - bitcoins are sent to the hash of a public key and the private key is used to prove ownership of the address and, ergo, all of the bitcoins credited to that account as inputs.  So a wallet can contain as many keypairs - and thus addresses - as you want.  Each transaction can have its own address if you want (and as you *should*, if you have a concern for privacy.)
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:36:57
I agree with all of your points, and sorry for not consolidating my replies above.
But how would this not be directly linked to "what people are willing to pay for it"?  The only real change here is that it delays price changes.  So if someone only wants to use BC as a laundry service, they have, say, an hour's window where they're guaranteed not to lose money on across the exchange.

@_date: 2013-04-12 15:01:39
And yet, this hurts the BitCoin - many people only want to use the protocol for the anonymity and security that it can provide and end up losing a lot of money because of market volatility.

I realize that


... but I see USD as under the stranglehold of centralized banks.  As the "little guy," I want a currency that isn't so susceptible to manipulation by whoever will pay top dollar.  This is why I'm switching to BTC for more than just financial gain / investment, but as a political and ideological shift that I hope frees our money.
It's not even so much about freeing our money: in my mind, money is simply a way to facilitate human interaction - so when I say "free our money" I really mean "free ourselves."
Am I putting too much into this?  Is asking r/bitcoin mostly rhetorical and going to most likely result in a circlejerk?

Both bitaddress and bitcoinarmory are both good options imo, with bitcoinarmory allowing the option to create watch-only wallets.
