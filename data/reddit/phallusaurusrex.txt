Where else in the US can I purchase coins? I use GDAX and transfer over to Binance, but GDAX is Coinbase. I'd love to know of an alternative I can use.

Oh great, I'll check that out, this sounds exactly what I'm looking for, thank you

Using a site like Binance and exchanging BTC for different crypto, I need to track all of those exchanges back to USD. since everything I'm using on Binance traces back to BTC, I need to do the extra step of tracking what that is in terms of USD.
I'd rather play it safe for 2018 tax code and track this year

Neat thank you!

Binance has the cost in BTC but not USD. With all transactions for 2018 requiring conversion to USD, I'm trying to keep track of some transactions that I've done earlier this week

What are alternatives to purchasing with cash?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but why is the article written by Editor and when you go to the about me section it only mentions Editor and not the person? 
If this is how people prefer to read their news, from no name sources and claims that cannot be checked, it's a sad world.

I've emailed Fred a number of times and he's been VERY helpful in getting back to me.  It doesn't take more than 24 hours before I hear a response.
Did you send an email to support

Do you know what the alternative functionality of the PPCoin and freicoin is?  I'm going to look them up myself, but figured I'd ask as well.

True, I just preferred the safer route of allowing the verification process to happen.  I did forget about that, thanks.
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:49:36
At the end of the day, I like the extra security Coinbase provides.  But receiving a text from them followed by a couple of spam texts seems very fishy.  I don't put my cell phone online normally; this is a very rare case.
Anyway, thanks for the reply. It could be a bug and what not.  I emailed their support since Fred should know if some information has been compromised. I just don't want anyone to get their accounts broken in to.

I guess that's the standard now for a number of users.  Try to post some contribution to the subreddit, attach an address, and hope for donations.
Pathetic to be honest.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:26:26
He responded to me from that email, otherwise I'd PM it to you.  I've emailed them on several different occasions and have gotten pretty quick replies; I'm a bit surprised they're not helping you with your issue.
The only thing I can say is if you're transactions are still pending.  Users complain that they're not receiving their coins or funds from coinbase right away.  I've purchased 4 batches of coins and each batch lists the time and date of when the transaction will process.
If you go to your transactions page and click on the specific event, it should tell you when it will process.  I bought a batch last week that is due to process tonight by 7PM EDT.  Previous orders were right on time with their estimations.
Hope that helps!
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:25:23
And that's why I'm not as concerned about the dip; I feel there are plenty of buyers to mitigate the sellers.
Could I be wrong?  Absolutely, but the risk can be respected

Many online banking systems allow you to have a security question when trying to access the site from an unknown computer.  In fact, once you answer the question, usually you can allow the bank site to remember your computers credentials or forget it so that it will require the security answer again.
You should make sure that your bank has this type of verification.  On top of that, Coinbase does allow two-way verification.  You establish a phone number as your primary phone.  When you go to log on, Coinbase will ask for a verification code, which is sent directly to your primary phone via SMS.
If you have two-way verification via Coinbase, even if someone knows your email address and password, they'll need your cell phone to even log in.  If for some reason they get access to your account or the Coinbase DB and grab your account number and password for your bank, the banks security question will prevent them from accessing it as well.
A tip about the security question.  Just because it's a specific question, doesn't mean you have to answer it with the correct answer.  If it asks what city you were born in, your valid answer could very well be PurpleMonkeyDishwasher.

This is what this subreddit should be about.  I honestly wish there would be heavier moderation to remove memes and fluff.
I get that reddit has a voting system in place and the stuff people wish to see will rise to the top and correct itself.  Well, there are a bunch of stupid people online and it happens across a large number of subreddits.  
The subreddits I actually enjoy going to have heavier moderation.  Meme posts will be pointed towards a meme version of their subreddit while the original post is removed.  It helps people to continue to circle-jerk if they'd wish in a specific meme-subreddit while maintaining a cleaner and more constructive main subreddit.
@_date: 2013-03-28 18:09:54
Great heads-up, but this should apply to any site really.  I've seen it happen with Paypal and eBay.
If you need to verify it for your own safety, log into the site like you would typically and don't click any links in the email.
At least if you have the two-way verification with Coinbase, they would need to get a hold of your cell phone to actually log in beyond your username/password.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:26:51
That's completely fair.  What I'm pointing towards is only speculation and should be taken with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:26:05
Well, hash is still involved, just not what they think it is
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:44:30
Not sure if you're going to get back in, but sites like Coinbase have two-way authentication.  Even if my username and password go public, they'll need my cell phone for the final verification code that they text to you.

Are the bit addresses generated from third party sites and wallets safe from meeting with these brain wallet combinations?
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:13:14
No problem, and I don't want to sound like a dick about it.  I just think that good content delivered to this site will be tipped via the [bitcointipbot](  
It's better to strive for that than flood the subreddit with posts slapping your address on it hoping that you'll get a portion of a bitcoin thrown your way.  Read up on the tipbot if you're not familiar with it; it's tied to your username.

I don't think it's going to be a typical weekend dip due the 4-day weekend in the UK [(Friday and Monday off)](
If the correlation between Banks being closed on the weekends, especially with the UK, and the dips are true, I would speculate that this dip will be a bit longer.

I think a crypto-currency will exist in the future.  I don't think it will be Bitcoin.  Bitcoin has helped to shape what a crypto-currency will need; however, I think there has been a significant amount of damage done to the name that it will never break the mold.
The crash isn't a good thing, at all.  Now you have all of the "told you so" people chiming in.  A correction was due, but I don't think this was a correction.

Could you expand on that a bit more?  How is it trying to decentralize the internet completely versus the economic portions?

Who knows if it was actually a bug. I was able to view my account and info fine, but Buy/Sell certainly was taken down.

Got it.  I haven't withdrawn money from coinbase but I have had outside transfers into coinbase, which doesn't detail when the payment will be complete.
I think it took about 5 days for it to officially complete.  The transaction showed up in the coinbase list fairly quickly, though.  Hopefully this gets resolved soon.

I've heard about the whole "sunken treasure" concept and didn't give it much thought.  You've got a great point about older security issues that might not be understood at the moment.  As bitcoin iterates, it's possible that older lost wallets can be recovered.
I wonder, though, if private keys can be cracked with a dedicated processing network.  I feel like it could, but would take an extraordinary amount of time due to the length of the keys.  Are there any safety measures that prevent someone from trying numerous private keys against a wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:44:34
But it would be possible, and this fits the model of security issues now compared to the 23rd century.  Not saying that 248 encryption is a problem, but as decades pass and processing power increases, it wouldn't take as long to break a private key.
In that same scenario, a newer security encryption could be used.  People still active with their wallets could switch to the latest measures while old and lost wallets will have this easier to break private key.
That's a really great point about security being viewed from now until many many years from now.  People of the future would need to find wallets that have the older encryption, so it would be more of a sunken treasure hunt.
Very neat, this makes sense for expansion and cost-efficiency of "mining" for sunken treasure in the future.

Displaying your bitcoin address is pretty tacky.  You've conveniently labeled it "Bitcoin PRIDE" and, while I appreciate the creativity, begging/asking for donations when posting is annoying.

Why wouldn't you just cash out what you've put in leave the rest to continue to grow/diminish?
I've personally put in money I can completely lose, but at a certain point, I will cash out a bit to mitigate some of the risk.

It's great that you can buy some products with bitcoins; the more businesses the better.
But, people have bills to pay, be it utilities, rent, food, etc.  Until those services can be purchased via bitcoins, people will continue to use USD/EUR/etc as their primary source.
I'd love for Bitcoins to become the currency it is striving for; decentralizing the economy can truly stop the fabrication of money out of thin air.  I do worry about how that will affect the world as a whole.  I'm no economist, but what would happen to the debts of the world?  Current countries use this debt as a means of protection against each other, wouldn't it be dangerous if this debt were to become null and void?
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:34:30
Oh, I agree on that part, which is why I don't see the point of the other coins.
I just don't see the benefit of any of them, at the moment, and was seeing if other people do see potential.

I see that with Litecoin and, unless there is a significant difference, I can't see any alternative digital coins having something better to offer.  Especially since they don't have different physical properties that can benefit anyone in any form due to cheaper costs in materials.

First of all, don't ask for donations here.  There are other subreddits in the bitcoin area that are for beggars as well as charities.
Secondly, this sounds like a scam.  You've just written a story on this site with no actual proof of who you are and what you've been able to do with the "very small support locally".
On top of that, your account was created less than an hour ago.

Best way to support the currency is to take the fiat you would have used to buy your item, convert it to bitcoin, and pay using your bitcoin for the item you wanted.
Yes there is some risk involved.  The price could go down or up.  But, if you were to buy a $50 game anyway, why not buy $60 worth of bitcoin to cover the cost of the game in case of dips. The value might go up as well, but more importantly you're supporting the use of bitcoins as a currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:58:51
I was thinking of the finite number 21 million and, overtime, having a larger number of them lost.  While the bitcoin can be subdivided into smaller fractions easily, wallets likely hold more than 1 bitcoin.
It could potentially reach a point where there are very few coins.  Sure, it would take time, and maybe another digital currency would evolve from Bitcoins, but it seems like a decent issue.

I've been using Coinbase, but there are delays to be expected with it.
Verifying a bank takes about 3-5 business days.  Once verified, you can make an initial purchase, which takes about 3-5 business days.  
You cannot make multiple purchase orders until your first order is complete, so if you purchase 1 BTC today and decide you would like more the next day, you'll have to wait until the initial purchase went through.
After that, though, the process is smooth.  Multiple purchase orders can be started.  There is a limit on how much you can buy/sell per day; however, that limit gets bumped up after 30 days from your first purchase with a verified account.
There have been complaints that the rolling limit of purchasing coins prevents users from buying.  I've found that if I click 'Buy' a few times, the order completes.  Note that a pop-up is introduced to confirm your purchase, so you're not actually submitting a ton of purchasing orders.
While there was some lag with Coinbase earlier, if you understand the processing time, they handle it fairly well.  People have complained that the transaction is still pending, yet if you look at the transaction history, it will tell you when the order will process to the hour.  I have not had an issue with this in any shape or form.
The amount of verification to sync with your bank as well as the two-way verification via cell phone SMS makes me feel a bit safer about someone accessing my account.
Edit: I know this isn't the fastest method; I just find it to be one of the safest

Right, and like Miner_Willy pointed out, security changes would occur over time to combat the increase of computing power so that wallets remain safe.  Older wallets that were lost would probably not be upgraded and be vulnerable to plunders, which isn't a bad thing if those coins were lost for a long time.  It would bring them back into circulation.
And you're absolutely right, it wouldn't be an issue until a very long time.  I was just curious if it would be possible to ever get them back so they're at least in circulation again.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:36:02
They could have been miners or held their bitcoins on offline wallets from before.  Waiting to be verified so they could transfer and offload.

If the code can be modified to make them divisible even more, and propagate across the network to all existing wallets, then this changes things a ton.
Then the market wouldn't be 21 million bitcoins, but 2.1 billion bitcents were a bit cent would be trading for $100 (if bitcoins were up to $10,000 for example).
I didn't think it could be even more divisible, but if wallets and all are tied to the network, it should be able to synchronize them all for the real value.
