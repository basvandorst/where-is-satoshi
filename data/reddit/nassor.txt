That is a damn good question that I have been asking myself for the past year! I honestly don't have a good explanation as to why they won't take my money. Unfortunately this is far more common than you'd imagine.

Thank you I appreciate it. I am very lucky indeed, it's a good company. They definitely did a background check with a credit screening but it didn't matter.

I was apprehensive about being interviewed but I know there are literally millions of people in similar situations so I figured why not?
@_date: 2014-06-19 22:48:06
No, but I believe in it. Just haven't made the leap.
@_date: 2014-06-20 01:55:24
Thank you! The actual amount overdrawn was ~$550 it was because I forgot about a couple automatic bill payments that came due all on the same day. So I had less money than I thought I did. In hindsight I should've shut those off long before that happened but lost track dealing with job searching and trying to make ends meet. That's not an excuse. I fucked up.

I was wondering when this would get posted to reddit. That guy is me. My Bluebird account was compromised over the weekend and I made this [post]( over in A lot of people commented on why I had $23k all in one spot, on a prepaid card nonetheless. My explanation caught the eye of Washington Post Business journalist Danielle Douglas. She sent me a PM here on reddit then she interviewed me via email over the past few days.
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:04:55
It is isn't it? As soon as I saw it was posted I camped out  waiting to see where it would land on reddit. Glad to see it was @_date: 2014-06-19 23:14:29
Thanks man!
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:53:54
It's all from direct deposits so that's considered to be "safe" from a bank's perspective. I don't think you're allowed to load straight cash to those amounts on these cards in the US.
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:16:14
Thanks man!

They aren't bad! I think it's the way banking should be.


Having to log into your app, type in the number, get the confirmation code, then write the check with the confirmation code on it is the awkwardness. Yes writing checks is awkward they made it even more awkward. Seems like there should be a better way (with the same protections).

Thanks! Took a while but I finally figured out how to claim it. The FAQ in the tip doesn't make it clear that you have to command the bot to send the tip to your personal wallet. Seems to be more focused on giving rather the receiver.
Anywho thanks again!

Can you elaborate? EC2 is what you make of it. Instagram which handles many Gbps of terrible pictures being shot across the globe runs fairly solidly and is built entirely on EC2. 
EC2 gets a bad wrap because Amazon offers a lot of packages of questionable stability but at it's core you can fire up a pure VM in seconds and deploy whatever home brew system you have running in moments. That's the real power. 
Edit: Instagram's engineering blog 
Edit: This will likely never get read but ironies of irony NASDAQ uses Amazon Web Services now lol

Thank for the link I'll check it out.


I understand the need. I'm not worried that I'd be buying from a scammer I'm worried about my personal information being stored with an unknown entity that I've never heard of. What happens if they get hacked?
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:42:13
The information I'm talking about I've given to federal, state, and local governments (required to), two banks, apartment management, and employer. They could very well get hacked. My apartment could get robbed. I refuse to add an anonymous website to that list. It's a valid excuse.

One quick suggestion before you guys start getting too far ahead. Can you make it agnostic of what's being traded? Rather than BTC to USD it would commodity to value. Like if someone wants to build a baseball card exchange using seashells as currency with this platform they should be able to. 
Anyhow I'd like to help out as much as possible I'm a software engineer contractor between contracts at the moment. I'm not sure I'd be much help because 99% of my experience is in digital imaging in real time systems but I guess you never know!
@_date: 2013-03-31 00:25:10
Will do!
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:10:46
Amazon now has a tier that satisfies the DoD security requirements. NASDAQ has also rolled out a financial records cloud platform using Amazon. 
Yes there are risks but right now MtGox is dead in the water I would've thought this would be rock bottom?
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:37:27
It was obvious bitcoin was in bubble mode when I first started researching it a few weeks back. Exponential growth in a financial market is not normal or healthy. My gut is ~30 USD/BTC. With it finishing out in the $40 range by years end. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:12:15


Weird NASA, the DoD, and NASDAQ are all migrating services to public cloud services. Maybe their foolish or maybe you guys are wrong.

I have a game I posted to XBox Live Inde Games a few years ago that was a spectacular flop. I open sourced the code a while back so I think this community will appreciate that. To test the bitcoin waters I'm going to spend a few weeks to redo some gameplay I thought that sucked, and get it running on Windows plus Linux. I'll post it pay as you wish in BTC exclusively and see what happens. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:03:19
I'm down with that. I have no idea how to do this. Please explain...
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:13:19
Thank you I was just wondering about that.

Shorting? IIRC none of the exchanges have this capability right now... In fact short selling probably would stabilize a fair amount of the volatility because the only possible bets you can make these days is that it will go up. If you want to bet that it will go down in value the only option (that I'm aware of) is to not participate.   
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:45:11


I'm a newbie interested in joining your community which would benefit you. I have some concerns and this is your reaction?
What about the countless others that are just hearing about bitcoin? Do you think I'm the only one who thinks this way? You do realize in order to grow this into something viable it's gotta more than a few redditors. Hostility to valid concerns about identity theft at a level that could ruin a person's life?
I was here looking for ways to participate now not so much.
Edit: added the quote.

It's not backups did you watch the video? It's first line financial record storage. The link you looked at points to AWS usages for backups and storage. 
Anyhow the meme you are spouting is cloud computing isn't secure enough for anything sensitive yet right now NASDAQ is building a cloud distributed system for financial record storage (probably the most sensitive data out there). 
What I find hilarious is MtGox has been hacked in the past, currently can't handle a DDoS, and also dead in the water waiting for servers to delivered in two weeks. I don't understand how anyone can honestly argue that cloud services would be worse because right now they're at rock bottom. You literally can't do worse. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 23:01:21
I understand where you're coming from. Identity theft is a major issue that will follow for you your entire life. It's ruined careers, marriages, and people have committed suicide over it. I'm extremely diligent about about who I send that level of information to. Everyone should be. That being said this particular branch has been about me not wanting to give an amount of information I consider need to know basis to some entity I haven't gained a level of trust with yet.
Since then a lot of great folks have posted great alternatives to Mt.Gox. So I'll explore those.
