The growth is more exponential than it is parabolic. Sure, over smaller scales these two curves can both be similar in shape, but there are infinitely many unique curves that can also fit.
It's in the nature of asset growth that at any point in time, the expected growth/decline is going to be a percentage of its current value, and at any point in the past or future, that same fact will still hold. This is true of exponentials, but not parabolas.

You could tell me the moon is made of cheese and I'd be convinced.
Name checks out.

If a global depression hits, Bitcoin is going to drop 95% in price. Speculative investments don't bode well in times of crisis.
And even in the off chance that crypto becomes the adopted global currency that we're all hoping for, why would it be immune to a global depression? It wouldn't.

The computing power required for that difficulty is so enormous that you'd actually be able to crack most passwords stored today with brute force. Bitcoin in its current state will be long dead by the time that could possibly happen.  
3Blue1Brown made a great video on Youtube titled "How secure is 256 bit security?" which is exactly the same problem as you've posed.

That makes perfect sense! I didn't think of the hash as being an actual number. Thanks.

If the hash result is in hexadecimal, then making the difficulty increase from 13 to 14 starting zeroes will mean it's 16x harder. If the hash is in binary, adding another zero still makes it twice as hard. Is the difficulty multiplier really this discrete or can it be more fine-tuned?

If that nano-Bitcoin isn't 1/7382547 of a Bitcoin, then that's un-American.

Put that into a calculator and 2478/2478 = 1 will be calculated first. Your brackets needs to go around the numerator only.

Simple password, many hints, requiring a computer repairer to restore windows, viruses.
It's an expensive lesson you've learned today.

It'll come when we least expect it, which is apparently a date that you can predict lol

When Bitcoin gets to 1 million dollars, a Satoshi will be worth 1 cent.

And don't run in the exact opposite direction with 540, no, put them off their game with a 520.

For crypto, anything ticking on a few months of income I'd count as a big amount. A couple weeks of disposable income or less is a small amount.

The bolivar has just hit 40,000&amp; inflation, which means that if this inflation rate holds true, the bolivar will have lost 99.5&amp; of its value in 6 months. Compare that to the current bitcoin crash of 70&amp;

Couldn't you disable the reload option then?

Which is different to the median. Check and mate.

Replace fiat by Bitcoin and your argument is the same - moot.
