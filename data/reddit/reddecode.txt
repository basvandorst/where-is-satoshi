I had the same situation and I tried to shut it down and got the usual pop up not to shut down the computer till that window disappeared; but it remained long and the client seemed frozen. However after checking the log file I noticed that it was Rolling Forward although it seemed frozen. Just waited and after quite a long time it did shut down.

It is absolutely admirable to donate to those who are really in need. However it is disappointing to see that in all such cases more often than not, those who have profited from open source technologies, often forget the developers and the contributing communities. I sincerely hope that they do not forget the goose and focus only on the golden eggs. There are so few working on Satoshi Client; the block chain and secondary associated cryptography and many of them at personal costs, especially if they are developing the technology in innovative way. Helping through financial clout to nudge Coinbase to implement Segwit or other innovations that will keep blockchain adaptable to present and future challenges by supporting such causes and the technological breakthroughs would be no less a contribution. 
No doubt the situation has changed a bit, Buterin could in fact raise a huge sum within a short period of time. But I wonder if Finney, Szabo and Dei ever were rewarded for their contributions fairly and of course there are many more.  Helping the decentralized technologies to develop will in fact be greater service, since it will have the potential to make much of the present charity partly redundant; as it has the potential to empower people financially.
