The paranoid side of me thinks this is the point of their legislation. A kind of "we can't get our crap together, so let's force (via regulation) them down to our level".

He did at the very end. The interviewer kept hounding him. Essentially he states the get-rich-quick people (i.e. The Winklevoss bros) have turned it into a game of "who is the greater fool". He seams to think of bitcoin solely as an investment vehicle.

You've probably already given your talk by now, but here is the app I want:
A payment app that releases funds for something being shipped to me after I have signed for it and entered a pin/code. I have had USPS and FedEx leave stuff at other peoples houses (and they signed for it out of pure habit) and tell me they delivered it my my house.

The whole "blockchain is awesome, Bitcoin not so much" argument is getting old. I think I'm going to start telling people that is like saying "HTML is great, but I don't think the internet will succeed."

Two things need to be communicated:
1. Bitcoin is more secure than credit or debit cards
2. Bitcoin is also just as easy to use (or easier)
I think analogies work best, so here it goes:
Customer is purchasing something at a big box store that looks suspiciously like a cross between Home Depot and Target. Customer hands over a large key that says "credit/debit" on it and tells the checker "I trust you won't overcharge me or give my account number to anyone else". Or something to that effect.
Cut scene to checker handing a copy of the key to a telecommunications worker and says something like "I trust this transmission will get there securely". Checker hands over one copy of the key, but a copy stays in their hand.
Cut scene to telecommunications worker outside of large non-descript building that reads ""Secure" transactions" ("secure" is in quotes on the building sign). Tons of scuzzy looking criminals are standing around watching the transaction with binoculars and bolt cutters in hand. Telecommunications worker hands a copy of the key (with one copy still in hand) to an IT worker with a combover and says "I trust only the amount authorized will be withdrawn, and no one else gets a copy of the safe key".
Cut scene to combover IT worker at a bank vault with lock boxes. He puts hands a copy of the key (with a copy still in hand) to a low level bank employee and says "I trust only the proper amount will be withdrawn". The low level employee mumbles something to themselves goes to the safe, opens it and takes out some money, flips through it, pockets some, puts the remaining amount into a different box that resembles the Home Depot/Target looking store and says "We're good".
Cut scene to IT combover guy tells telecommunications worker "We're good". Cut quickly to telecommunications worker telling cashier "We're good". Cut quickly to cashier telling customer "We're good". All scenes clearly display that all actors involved still have a copy of the key on them.
Cut back to bank. Criminal uses a copy of the key to open the customer's lock box and says out loud and with merriment "We are good". He proceeds to empty the box.
Cut back to store. The second customer in line comes up to the cashier, shakes her cellphone and a Bitcoin drops out of it. She hands it to the cashier, who verifies its value immediately (maybe he chomps on it like they used to do with gold). Cashier says to customer two "We're good"
End scene.
