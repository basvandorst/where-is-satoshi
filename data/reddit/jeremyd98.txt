Same over here in NZ!
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:37:39
Same thing has happened to me - two days ago sent a transactions with low fees and absolutely no confirmations. Just accepted it and waiting till it eventually gets picked up 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:58:28
I did a similar thing a couple of days ago but from blockchain.info to ledger nano. Took me 31 hours because i used the lowest possible fees

In the exact same boat but the opposite way around - ride out the wave and just wait it out I guess 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:56:53
Please pay more than 500sat/byte unless you want to be waiting more than 30 hours for a confirmation - many unconfirmed confirmations so you’d want your transaction confirmed ASAP

Irrelevant - there are many other Indians in India who have 200,000x the amount as other Indians in their currency and life still goes on. Use smaller bits and your problem is solved

My transaction is 30 hours unconfirmed

@_date: 2017-12-09 08:10:50
It is a myth - no matter how low the fee it’ll either get included in a block in due time, or get orphaned back to the origination

what's the evidence that we haven't already hit the correction? Asking from a perspective where I want to increase the amount of btc I own so waiting for the perfect time to get as much value possible
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:25:55
Hey, to be completely honest I'm win you in the sense that I'm not 100% sure on what Segwit has to do with it - but I'm a strong believer in how bitcoin can help change the future of currency. There is no way to be able to time the market and I've learnt that the hard way.
I first bought btc at 3900, and regret not buying a full btc. Now is always the best time to buy, planning on buying 2k worth more tomorrow (all figures in nzd)
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:59:22
Buy on Localbitcoins.com - takes a few minutes to get yourself verified with a server, but safe option and then transfer to a blockchain.info wallet imo
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:52:38
Were you trying to send money to your blockchain wallet? If so the receive address does change 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:16:11
Thanks - actually got that tip from this subreddit. I also factored in opportunity cost if I missed out on gains we've been seeing for the past year 
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:10:51
Thanks for that, I will look into electrum and possibly buying a trezor - although I have heard dodgy things about trezor recently 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:06:38
Okay so you purchased coins from BTCDirect, put your bitcoin wallet address as the address you copied and pasted from blockchain's receive option? If so, I don't see how that could go wrong

Beware - there is a dip coming, no one knows when, how or how much it will tank. Only invest the amount of money you wouldn't mind loosing. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:41:52
blockchain.info is the best in my opinion - never store your btc in exchanges 
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:44:41
In a years time, the current rate might as well be considered cheap coins
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:05:17
we can't time the market remember?
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:05:03
wow, never ever looked at it in that way - Hopefully one day 1 satoshi will be worth atleast 50c
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:36:45
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:25:39
As far as I know there is a difference between the receiving address and the wallet address
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:01:03
Any sources to back up these claims?
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:31:45
That's correct - for example I use localbitcoins.com almost daily and it takes about 2 minutes to transfer from my lbtc to my blockchain wallet
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:42:12
out of curiosity - what was the rate you first purchased at?
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:58:31
100% agree, im in for the long haul
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:19:44
Okay well if you're saying that you put your blockchain wallet address then I think you did loose it. I almost made that mistake because I saw that the receive key changed but searched it up online and found out you're not supposed to give out your wallet address
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:59:48
thanks for the advice, which wallet would you recommend excluding hardware wallets like trezor
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:41:30
Hope you don't mind the noob question, but can you buy btc off blockchain.info

Now is always the best time to buy bitcoin - you can never time the market but if you believe in what bitcoin stands for you shouldn't think twice if you're investing safe amounts 
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:47:43
Okay cool, I live in New Zealand so I'm not actually too sure if I have the option of buying straight from blockchain.io - have been using it as a wallet and transactions appear quick so far good experience with it 
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:23:45
Sorry - bad phrasing on my behalf - edited

Exactly what I was thinking, he is in early 20's so i'm guessing he's been working full time for maybe 5 years? which is around 30k per year. Unsure about the facts behind my claim, but 150k in savings is no small achievement imo

Wow putting your life savings is risky - Congrats for having balls bigger than my dreams
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:09:00
I work around 20 - 25 hours per week, earn 21.60 nzd per hour (14.85 usd atm) plus benefits, minus taxes plus i'm a full time student. Live at home, no real expenses just yet except for basic items like gym memberships and streaming services, so saving my money isn't too hard right now. Once I move out and have to start paying bills and all it'll be much harder. 150k in savings is alot, but I get where you're coming from, where I live that's not even enough to put down for a house deposit. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:04:17
That's a really good idea - the only issue I have with that is you get less and less each time you buy at the rate the price has been growing. In saying that it's impossible to time the market, so you would be better off if china decides to fuck with us again.

When I tell people who ask me about how bitcoin works they are flummoxed by the fact that it does not inflate. There is no reason that a handful of families should be able to control the worldwide circulation of money. Not enough people know the truth 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:13:03
Whilst that would be amazing, I think it's more of proving that as a team we have the ability to form a new currency without the help of the government. I know how corrupt they are and the fact is that most people are happy going their whole lives without ever attempting to research what's actually happening behind the walls of the federal reserve and the petrodollar. I could get called a conspiracy theorist but imo that's far better than acknowledging you know nothing about something so vital to our everyday lives and yet don't find any importance in seeking for the truth. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:43:45
This is exactly what i've been doing, also cryptopia is a NZ exchange which allows you to buy and sell many different coins with NZD, but local bitcoins by far is the easiest
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:07:51
This isn't aimed at you by the way, it's just what I say to myself to pull the trigger 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:09:14
I'm with you brother! I wish I went all in when I made my first purchase and it was sitting at around 2200usd per bitcoin. But no point looking back i guess. The faucets completely shocked me - I read somewhere that the original ones used to give 5btc per faucet 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:16:29
Good to know we're in the same boat! I hope when the day comes I can buy my dream car using just bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:16:17
Yes, I have the 12 word key - thanks for that explanation, cleared some of my worries out

@_date: 2017-10-26 20:14:47
I wish I got into bitcoins at that age, but I was still at college and barely had $500 to my name 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:57:30
What if I do make the switch to these wallets, and for some reason my computer crashes and fails completely? Will I be safe if i've got my private keys? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:07:23
Look at the long term - That's how I convince myself to buy in large chunks. So what if it's $300 more expensive today? Don't you believe that one day it'll be worth tenfold what you invest?
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:04:45
i'm a guy lol 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:17:20
That's a good plan - I'd never invest more than what i'd be willing to loose. Good luck with the job search! 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:15:22
Good luck man! Props to you for knowing what the real struggle is like 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:14:15
You made the right choice to invest in yourself - keep buying bitcoins and you'll thank yourself when your on the moon (figuratively)

I'm sorry if you're calling Dollars and Pounds real money, you need to educate yourself on how the federal reserve works and how the petrodollar plays a big part in it. But then again i'm 99% sure you're a troll spam bot

@_date: 2017-10-26 07:12:17
Yup, they can! I've had a look at their website, haven't used them as yet. They are an Australian company but offer btc trading using nzd as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:34:47
Those were my famous last words - i'll buy when it gets lower 
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:14:54
It all depends on your financial situation - I first bought a chunk of bitcoins at $50nzd when the rate was $3500 nzd (2406.60usd). I wish I went all in and bought half a bitcoin right then and there because I did have the money, I just thought I was playing it safe. Dollar cost averaging is the safe option, but if you believe in bitcoin and understand the potential it could one day have, I would go all in from the get go. Anytime i'm about to buy and get cold feet I always remind myself that i'm buying bitcoin because of the potential I know it has of reaching 6 figures, and would rather willingly invest a small amount (in relation to what i'm going to earn over my whole life span) in something that could make my life a hell of a lot easier when i'm older. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:59:09
is money not a store of value? Are you implying that cryptos are not a digital currency? And who is They? and what they not want us to have? Drugs? Alot of confusion from what you just said

@_date: 2017-10-22 21:13:51
Can we make up our minds about timing the market, is it something we do on the daily and claim we shouldn’t do or are posts like this just here to hype me up and and buy more btc (because trust me it works)
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:00:38
imo it is possible, but it does depend heavily on what your living arrangements are, I am lucky enough to still live with my parents so I haven't yet had to pay any outgoings such as rent. If you are an 18 year old, getting any job is worth it because you work your way up into higher paying jobs (atleast that's what happened to me since I first started working) you take whichever jobs you can to build up skill and most importantly have a reference who can help you out and get you into a better job

I guess if you are using a home printer which is your own personal one, it shouldn’t bother you about someone having access to the file. I haven’t completely disregarded the option of a trezor is something similar, but I’m a student and money isn’t as free flowing as I’d like it to be :) but it is something on the Christmas Wishlist
