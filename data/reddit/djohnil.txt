This is the exact reason why early adopters like us will potentially be handsomely rewarded.  We are working through the learning curve and bearing an extreme amount of risk by backing such cutting edge technology.  We have decades to go!

Luckily there are projects working on this problem.  I'm thinking the internet service SpaceX is trying to create should be beneficial as well.

If I can hold fedcoin in my hardware wallet and it is stable it would be better than going to fiat on an exchange during times of uncertainty.  Fiat backed with cryptoassets will probably be a good thing.

Perhaps; however, I doubt I will live to see that day.  We will likely experience violent revolutions and potentially world war 3 first.... Time will tell!  It is certainly one of the most interesting times to be alive from a human history standpoint.

That wouldn't surprise me.  He keeps my faith in humanity alive.

You should give some to the planetary society to fund space research.  They will be my number one non-profit to give big to when/if I am worth over 5 million.  I hope there are more people out there like us!  Give back to society, hoarding more than you need is negligence!

No one knows what will happen.  I would prefer a situation where the world doesn't end as we know it.  That will require the powers that may be to get with the times and introduce proper regulation.  A thousand years from now I doubt fiat will be a thing, so if you live that long you may see a day where central banks are no longer relevant.  :)

That is precisely the reason all of my liquid wealth is in crypto.  Adoption by central banks will ultimately be a good thing.

Why don't people trade their bitcoin for litecoin, send off to an exchange offering bcc pairs then trade back for bitcoin?  Took 10 minutes....
