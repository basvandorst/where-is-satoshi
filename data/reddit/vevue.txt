I think right now its tough to see the true vision of Swarm because what they're doing has never been done before.  Because "equity crowdfunding" is still illegal, Swarm had to take a step back and redefine/create an entirely new business structure in order for the public to participate in their vision of what crowdfunding can become with a new technology, the Blockchain.
I highly recommend reading their Whitepaper on this new business structure they've built, Distributed Collaborative Organizations (DCO) - 
When you visit  you can see the beginning of their efforts to help educate the public.  Also, you can scroll to the bottom and enter the forums where there is a community of Swarm Agents willing to answer any questions you may have.  
You can browse the current projects; 
Soon our team at Vevue, will be launching our first crowdsale with Swarm.  Our infographics do a good job of explaining the DCO structure; 
You can also visit our website for a more detailed explanation of DCO's   At the bottom we link to a DCO FAQ, DCO contract and Step by Step guild to building your own DCO.
Once the next round of crowdfunding projects go live it will be much more apparent just how innovative Swarm and their DCO business model will be in changing the future of business.

Swarm is still a crowdfunding platform and always will be.  Over the last several months they have innovated and redefined what crowdfunding can become with the DCO model.

Mr Varoufakis told the Telegraph that the Mr Schauble has made up his mind that Greece must be ejected from the euro, and is merely biding his time, knowing that the latest bail-out plan is doomed to failure.
"Everybody knows the International Monetary Fund does not want to take part in a new programme but Schauble is insisting that it does as a condition for new loans. I have a strong suspicion that there will be no deal on August 20," he said.
He said the EU authorities my have to dip further into the European Commission's stabilisation fund (EFSM), drawing Britain deeper into the controversy since it is a contributor. By the end of the year it will be clear that tax revenues are falling badly short of targets - he said - and the Greek public ratio will be shooting up towards 210pc of GDP.
"Schauble will then say it is yet another failure. He is just stringing us along. he has not given up his plan to push Greece out of the euro," he said.

Currently 5 Bitcoin left at Gemini then $10,000 per coin. 
Moon time!  
Could we possibly be nearing a point where exchanges run out of Bitcoin?  Short squeeze across all exchanges would be massive.  ATH here we come!
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:55:21
@_date: 2015-11-14 04:01:25
All Time High!
All though technically $2200 is now the ATH.
@_date: 2015-11-14 13:23:57
cool, the article quotes Vevue!  
I thought about it more last night.  I think its safe to say that since Gemini has started trading most of their volume comes from people acquiring Bitcoin without the purpose of selling anytime soon.
Which makes me think with only 14,838,200 BTC	 available and at least 10-20% of those tied up between Satoshi and lost wallets.  How much longer do we have until 99% of all coins are held by people with no intentions of selling.
Maybe Gemini running out of coins is just the beginning of a major short squeeze!

They've been pretty vocal about having institutions lined up.  On CNBC the other morning they said they're watching the deposits flow in.
Hopefully the buying starts soon...

Our start-up, Vevue, is close to launching a Beta version of our App.  There are similarities to Pokemon Go; visit a location, record a video and receive Bitcoin.

We like to think we're bringing Google Street view to life through real-time/live content.  We hope to see our API being used by Yelp and other sites that provide business profiles.  
Locally 
- you could pin a Vevue Request to your favorite bar to get an idea of how many people are currently there
- businesses can create Requests to draw in customers 
    - video reviews next to written reviews on Google Local
Internationally 
- travel the world from the comfort of your couch
We hope to literally push bitcoin into every last crevice on the planet.
