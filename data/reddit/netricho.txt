All we need is a nice pump, and we can buy &amp; build our city there. Cryptopolis! Just perfect. :D

Actually i copy pasted your comment. " Bitcoin can't go to zero. " But originally i wanted to react to " Bitcoin CAN go to zero. " with the "here we go again"  meme thing. It was just a joke. Nevermind. I will not edit that. My bad.
Anyway, if you ask me, tho. I think it can, technically speaking, it's a highly speculative asset. So, like everything else it can. But, i hardly doubt it will, at this point.
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:24:33
Yapp, i feel sorry now, you can believe me. :I

So, you say that the $125 million insurance money it's only the beginning. Measuring the need for it?  
I think we can't really excpect a huge impact on Sept 23, or soon after that. Later, tho... :)
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:15:27
Dunno, i use to censor words like that. Which is funny, because i talk dirty in public most of the times. I guess i compensate here. :D

I became a no coiner. The Market f me in the b\*tt lately. I sold BTC for alts, right before the +1K BTC pump, i bought back, and now a mini altseason happened, BTC did nothing. Now i sold all. I feel like sh\*t right now. Somebody please punch me in the face. Seriously i did anything wrong what i could. This can be an indicator for you guys, because now BTC will pump again for sure. And this is a hide the pain smiley right there -&gt; :)

Don't know. I'm looking at the charts, and this triangle, which we are in right now, looks like the mini version of the 2017-2018 pump &amp; aftermath. Just instead of the 6000 support zone, we keep revisiting the 9500. I'm scared that a November like one year ago will be happen again. But as i said, i know sh\*t. Do the opposite, and hodl.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:48:34
November, oh Jezz. You won, bro. Let's hope so. :)

Greed. Yeah, i know. Funny, because when i'm actually trading with leverage, i use only 2%.
@_date: 2019-09-02 09:09:26
Compare to the Tradingview (BTC.D), it's different. 72% already. Which is more accurate?
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:30:43
The feeling when you sold all your BTC yesterday, right around 10K, because you thought it'll gonna go back down, and your plan was buy more after...but now you fcked. Priceless.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:58:00
I'm only about 2 years in crypto. But without a doubt, this September was my worst of all. All my decision was a pure garbage. Just like now. I bought myself in, right before the crash. Literally half an hour before that. I said to myself, it's too obvious, it's gonna dump, that's why i buy now. This triangle, will end soon. It's too obvious...LOL...no sell, no loss, right guys. Auch. :D
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:56:36
Thanks man. But, i'm not leaving or anything. I truly believe in crypto overall. And in some sick way i like this behaviour, i'm just fighting with the good old greediness. Quitting from this, seems nearly impossible. It's like a drug, and made me an addict. You can't help me, i'm appreciate your advice, tho. Only Rektness can stop me. This sell is just temporary, i paid the price, and the market is always right. :)
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:09:04
All this time I thought I had learned my lessons. I went through such things many times before the years. But i guess there's only so much can learn a person until he reaches the limits of his capabilities. The greed kicks in everytime. I want more &amp; faster. Now my profits are melted, and i'm back to the baseline.  
And sure you can trade the patterns, no problem, but money management is the real issue here. I moved my whole stash in, and out.

Resistance, but obviously it was not a strong one. ;O
@_date: 2019-09-02 10:13:40
Dunno, on Tradingview i see a double wick from 2017 May and June. Maybe will reach that top 77%, and then drops to about 60% - 65% region while still remains in the uptrend channel. That would give some breath space for alts aswell. Will see.

Surely Xi Jinping could do something against Bitcoin. Just imagine the amount of mining farms working in China. He makes a Thanos snap to them, and apocalypse happens on the market. They are smarter then that, sure, but he could.

Is that quantum resistance can be a real issue for Bitcoin in the near future? (NSA Reportedly Developing Quantum-Resistant Crypto - Coindesk)
