Yes..WE don't worry..Cheers man!!
Sorry for assuming. I guess i just overdid the LN evangelist thing there.

Please quote instances where they have done that rather than making claims. Do you have data pertaining to these alts from real world usage to support your argument? Or you just BELIEVE in your coin and devs like everyone else?

Why do we worry about making big transactions on LN? It is supposed to be for several, relatively smaller transactions..micropayments..
Once those micropayments don't clog the main chain, the higher value transactions on-chain too will become faster and cheaper..

Can i tip this post with some of that BCH i got from

Not everyone can be a prodigy or a girl genius but looks like we can still build things..Nicely done!

So thats only as far as you know. None of your altcoins are yet comparable to bitcoin in terms of length of chain, PoW infrastructure, real world stress tests(working at ~2500 Tx/Block and not being defrauded/ hacked), security and decentralization
You think all alt coins can do the same because they all CLAIM that. None of them have gotten even close to that scale to prove anything.
Only ETH has and everyone knowa the kind of sexurity problems it has faced. You still wanna bet against bitcoin. Most welcome!

Full nodes validate all transactions. Transactions are propagated to nodes and are only accepted if they are as per the agreed set of rules that make bitcoin, bitcoin. When majority of nodes are running the same rulesets (version of the core client), then these full nodes ensure that those consensus rules are followed.
If only miners ran full nodes, they could all collude to change the rules, run the version of software that suits them (say increases fees, decreases blocktime) and nothing can stop them. What does stop them is non-mining, user-run full nodes running the core client.
Full nodes are not compensated in any way except the satisfaction of having supported the network. That could change soon with LN though.

The group of you basically just shilled Bcash as the one with better chances because they are willing to play dirty if the need be..Compulsive argument for someone who thinks they missed the bitcoin train and want to make money with the hope of finding next bitcoin..
The replies from your accomplices simply try to drum up the old "censorship" cry to make this sound legitimate. 
Judging from the sly manipulation, you guys must be part of Roger Ver's A-team.
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:28:06
Most people at r/bitcoin who care enough are fed up of telling each new wave of newbies about the scammy marketing tactics of Roger Ver, Fraud by CSW and Jihan Wu's bitmain interests in having a centralized coin.
Now most new people know that its easier to own BCH than BTC. They too want to have the win of buying a sub-1000 coin and seeing it get to 10K. (That all BTC hodler had and that all newbies resent in varying degrees). Most people who owned huge stakes in Bitcoin also have BCH. I don't think they give a shit where this "marketing democracy" goes next. This is as far from their cypherpunk, sharing ideals as it can be. People who have been here don't want to expend energies on the BCH debate anymore.

Could you use a SegWit address next time and have something more engaging nearby?? Like a reference to LN. Links to bitcoin.org.

I think its a well-intentioned question to ask. A lot of us wonder about it  Yet, this cannot be settled till the adoption and affect of LN and other scaling technologies is established.
Only then can we have enough information that can help community/ devs to form a metric to determine optimum size. 
Till then, 2 mb, 4 mb..? How do you decide?
The "Lets just increase it to 2/ 4 mb" approach wouldn't work as things have moved too far along the path of using other scaling technologies.. I think it is still a waiting game..

This is getting so irritating..Newbies overdoing the meme thing with silly, stretched references that are not even funny..
A meme is supposed to be fucking funny..Not a bloody moral story..

LOL...You just validated what was being said above.
These discussions always end with laymen (talking about socio-political-economic experiments)
at the throats of Engineers (trying to explain sync time and latency or still available options for optimizing block usage)
Appreciate your willingness to understand but you are way out of your depth now. I have been through this stage and I understand its way more tempting to believe that "Blocksize increase will solve everything". This is because you are constantly told that it will increase adoption and increase price.
Stop thinking about price for once and just think about the importance of keeping bitcoin network robust and uncompromised in terms of centralization.

Now this is scary. So we are at something like 7K now. That means the biggest holders (Those who held through like 500-1000$) are still not wary of that.
Once it gets to some psychologicsl mark like say, 5K, A lot of these old holders may just decide to cash out rather than see their newfound riches vaporize.
If this analysis is correct, then that is when the real gory, blood-curdling massacre will start. We'll be seeing some real steep falls.
Hope none of this transpires. I'll be buying in with a loan if it ever goes to &lt;5K

My bad..! Thanks for pointing it out..
Atleast, the point on collision being too energy/ time intensive stands furthered with the 0.2% figure i googled..
@_date: 2019-09-23 04:11:33
LOL..Don't know what you meant by "Most of Earth's energy". Sounded like Final Fantasy.
 Bitcoin accounts for only about 0.2% of world's energy usage..Its a common deflection point to complaim about energy usage. Yet, its much lesser than all the other banking consumption.
The world can afford this with the value/ opportunities bitcoin has generated for people everywhere.
