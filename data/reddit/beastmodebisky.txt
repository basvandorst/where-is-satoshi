Classic attempted a ridiculous campaign of lies, manufactured urgency, network attacks, and misrepresented support in January with code designed to hard fork after 28 days. 
If that's not rushing a hard fork then what is?
How any single person in the Bitcoin community can trust anyone who actually went along with that plan is beyond me. Sure, some regular users got deceived into supporting Classic and I think most have probably realized the mistake now that they can clearly see all the scare tactics and such were complete lies. But the major players who supported it? If the 'free market' is supposed to hand out economic justice, those people should never see a single satoshi in business again.

Don't try to learn on a machine that holds some amount of money that you seem significant seems like common sense to me. It's the same as ever, only keep as much as you're willing to lose in a hot wallet. It doesn't matter if it's your phone or it's your computer running a node or doing Bitcoin development stuff.

Hey man, don't shoot the messenger. I highly doubt he would support such a plan. But thinking out loud and examining the incentives in a situation like this is valuable. Either the incentives exist, and it's a fundamental issue with Bitcoin, or they don't and we become more confident in the current economic model.

Fiat is an attempt at a decentralized consensus mechanism through cryptography?
I mean, I don't know if a sufficiently robust PoS system will emerge and be proven over time or not, but that comparison seems a bit silly.
Also people should realize that if PoS does become viable someone could fork Bitcoin and the PoW chain would stay in exactly the same state(ie no splitting miner resources). And everyone would have money on both chains. So there's no real need for everyone to get their panties in a bunch about it. It's only relevant if and only if it a specific system actually turns out to be able to work for decentralized consensus. And there's no more 'corruption' any more than there is with PoW. It may be flawed though, we'll know eventually whether it is or not. But we only have to gain really if someone pulls a Satoshi and comes up with a legitimate system. 
The only people I think who should rationally be against the concept are people heavily invested in PoW mining. For obvious reasons.

In January when Classic burst on the scene they heralded it as something with widespread consensus and even had a neat list of miners who supported it on the website. Turned out that they were lying about all the support. And after that from my observations the actual support was far from being close to widespread consensus. 
As far as 'serious support' goes, sure there were a fair amount of people serious about hard forking and put their reputations and money behind it. But nowhere remotely near any kind of consensus at all. And in my opinion it the amount of support in general was always overstated. But it's not easy to quantify such things, so that's just my estimation based on being in tune with the Bitcoin community for many years.
Sounds like there's going to be a 'hard fork' from some people happening. i.e. one with a check point that won't require any sort of mining support. I'm actually a bit surprised it's taken people this long to figure out that's the only way it's going to happen. Many times I wanted to tell people just to go do it with a check point since they don't remotely have anywhere near the support to actual hard fork Bitcoin. But I didn't think it was a good idea to push for further drama and such since we've already been through so much.
I doubt there will be too much support for this new effort. It might actually be better for everyone that all the people who really aren't happy with Bitcoin go off and do it themselves. I guess it will be pretty interesting to see how it goes. With ETC I see a very solid reasoning behind people's wish to continue to back their original unchanged ledger. But with this Bitcoin hard fork I don't see the fundamental issue being as serious as the motivations behind ETC. More like most people's prime motivations are based on falsehoods and Blockstream conspiracy theories.
At least now some people will be able to put their money where their mouth is on both sides by shorting the opposing currency and/or going long on their own.

Not sure why you're being downvoted. Obviously novice users should not be told to download Core. If they want to run a node then they shouldn't be keeping a hot wallet on that set up anyway. They can if they want, but if they're worried then it's such an obvious solution just to not keep BTC on the box.

Signing with the genesis block, or the 9th block coinbase reward that was known to have been used to send Hal one of the first Bitcoin transactions would be pretty significant.

Hard fork with 75% activation threshold (750 of 1000 blocks), 28 day activation grace period.

It's just not that simple though. You can't just evaluate the action as if it were in a vacuum. Refunding those investors who lost their money is an unprecedented move in a system that was very specifically designed to avoid such subjective decisions like this. It's certainly going to complicate things down the road and also questions the very incentives that were believed to be a fundamental part of the economics of permissionless blockchains.
Even without delving into the ethics of the fork, just the word you use, 'justice', is highly debatable. Some might argue that Stephen Tual's greed taking his $500k funding target and raising $200 million in a completely new, untested, and dangerous system instead qualifies him to be the one on the receiving end of 'justice'. I'm not necessarily going to make that argument, but the whole situation is far from crystal clear.

Yeah, if their product was supposed to be value added Bitcoin security it's pretty hard to look at the results and claim their service was effective.

@_date: 2016-08-11 19:49:58
Well, it's true that people do seemingly often lose large sums of bitcoin. But this case in particular is about a bank wire and doesn't have anything to do with losing BTC. 
Also, Bitcoin is actually safe to hold and transfer if some basic security is practiced. If you can safely store some information written down on a piece of paper then you can safely store bitcoin.
Using it securely and safely might be inconvenient though. Which is why people recommend you only deal with small amounts when spending with a hot wallet that is potentially vulnerable.

Kim Dotcom has been spouting off Bitcoin related BS for a long time now. I wouldn't take anything he says related to Bitcoin seriously at all.

Yeah I guess. But yesterday when we were talking about the dangers of Coinbase and their CEO's tweet that all funds were secured, people complained about Coinbase's lack of cryptographic verification to back that statement from the tweet.
And then in the same thread people were hailing Bitfinex as an example since apparently they had public cryptographic proof of reserves. Even though now it seems that their system was deeply flawed, I can see why people might have assumed that it was secure since it was seemingly being praised. People could have easily confused cryptographic proof of reserves with those reserves actually being physically secure in a cold wallet. I wouldn't have guessed that all those reserves would be in hot wallets.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:30:11

Still, lots of people seem to frame it as everyone being against the very concept of hard forking. Which like you say probably isn't the case. 
I think I may vaguely remember a couple of people who might have been opposed to doing any sort of hard fork, but I'm not even really sure I'm remembering correctly. Either way, I don't think it's a common enough opinion to ever threaten consensus should the time come for Bitcoin to do an upgrade via hard fork(which I think it will at some point).
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:38:35
That is a feature of crypto. At least the burning or blacklisting coins part. The business failure should just be a natural result of that anyway. But no one is actually going to do that I don't think.
I don't think it's worth it in the long run to hard fork or soft fork to change the ledger unless it's something like a fatal protocol error that means certain death.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:10:40


Would you happen to have a link to that statement by any chance? Because I've been following it a bit since the DAO failure and by and large the impression I got was that the attacker's funds were in no way a threat to PoS.
Also I think ETC will end up forking into two chains, one that keeps PoW, and one that goes along with PoS. If that happens it will be very interesting to observe.

Yeah, once banks start adding Bitcoin services to their regular menu of financial services that's when a lot of people who would never have touched Bitcoin will take a look at it.

How was their service sold to you, roughly speaking? Like is it offered as a secure way to manage BTC and prevent and/or limit theft?
Everything I'm seeing so far seems to point towards that being what they do. But if that's the case I don't see how a company focused on providing security can survive after what's taken place.
Unless they somehow are not at least partially responsible I really hope that all that VC money goes towards making people whole again. There's got to be a lot of people who've already contacted their lawyers. 
And now everyone is also probably waiting to sign up for a class action as well. Someone will start organizing people towards that goal soon I bet. Since BitGo themselves don't appear to have lost anything it's not one of those 'blood from a stone' situations where it's not worth going after them. They are VC funded and the quicker people get together and organize the better.

Hmm. I don't think taunting is such a good strategy personally. If Mexicans do actually end up having trouble moving money home, and Bitcoin can act as a solution to that issue, then it's probably best to draw as little attention to that as possible.

But if Mexicans were actually blocked from sending money through traditional channels back home, it could be a pretty big deal for Bitcoin.

That would mean massive amounts of LTC and ETH(/ETC?) get dumped on the market to regain 80% of the BTC that was stolen, right? 
If that is the case, that kind of complicates it a bit since the x millions of dollars of LTC and ETH they have don't necessarily equate to a similar amount of money when liquidated for BTC.

I think a lot of people had the expectation that the storefronts would be decentralized and hosted on the network by various nodes. Rather than people having to maintain their own server in order to sell things since that's already the current paradigm with the web.
Maybe they're working on making it like that. If someone wants to sell something online, they can run a website and accept Bitcoin. If people could sell things in some kind of decentralized hosting network sort of like how storj is going to work with storage, that might be a solid advantage over the traditional website for commerce.

That's true and that's how he sounded at the start. But I don't think he had time to really think through what happened and consider the fact that BitGo's system completely failed them in addition to their own systems being breached. It sounds like BitGo had one job and what they provided completely failed.
I guess we'll eventually find out more later on.

What is the purpose of 2 of 3 multisig if BitGo was automatically signing after Bitfinex signed?
I don't have any insider knowledge. But if the situation is different from the way it's been described by Zane Tackett on here and by this person in the posted article, someone from BitGo is doing a horrible PR job, since as far as I've seen there's been nothing offered to indicate otherwise. 
This person in the article who apparently is a BitGo customer describes the setup, and it seems silly to me for a company whose value proposition is supposed to be Bitcoin security, to have it where compromising a single server with its private key and it's API access is all it takes. It seems analogous to downloading a 2-factor authenticator program and using in on the same system you're logging into a website with. It kind of defeats the purpose of 2-factor authentication.
It effectively resulted in their whole wallet being a hot wallet. Sold as an improvement over traditional cold wallet storage which makes it worse. Unless there are some new facts here that have been held back for some reason. Which would seem crazy, since it's in BitGo's interest to communicate otherwise if the situation was different.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:22:36
I haven't read anything indicating that, no. So far it sounds like it was just Bitfinex. Don't take my word on that though, I'm just following along here and don't have any other information than what gets posted here.

Competing against an extremely well funded attacker would require a similar amount of funds.
Since Bitcoin is permissionless there's nothing to stop them. It's not like you can just cut them out, stop them from mining, stop them from launching other attacks from multiple vectors. The result would be a Bitcoin that's just a shell of its former self with a few enthusiasts trying to keep it alive for ideological reasons. But it would be economically destroyed.
It's been acknowledged for years that a full on attack on Bitcoin by a motivated actor with the resources of a modern state could effectively destroy Bitcoin as we know it. Anyone thinking otherwise is delusional.
It's censorship resistant. It is absolutely not censorship proof.

I agree that die hards will find a way. But didn't Localbitcoins stop serving Germany as a result of some government related issue? If they shut out Germany I can't see why they wouldn't do the same if the US government gave them reason to. Sure something else can replace it, and would, but by this point it's probably going to have a negative effect on demand if it gets this difficult to use in the US.
The cost of the spreads on Localbitcoins and other p2p type deals are often very high. Mess with accessibility and spreads are going get even higher, and the higher they go the less attractive Bitcoin becomes as an option to transfer fiat from point a to point b. Paying the spread twice can be expensive. By that point using the old style p2p method similar to Hawala where you need trusted intermediaries starts looking good again, unfortunately.

Was the CIA still involved in trafficking by the time the war on drugs started? I don't know all the details but I thought I remembered being something that went on earlier.
Also even so, people in the CIA taking advantage of their power to make money isn't quite the same as a top down strategy that condones those actions.
If Reagan actually knew that the war on drugs wasn't the best strategy, he still could have thought that doing it the 'war on drugs' way could still work. Not the best method, but maybe the method that scores the most political points with the public. Like it makes it appear that they're actually doing 'something' and being 'tough on crime'. It's one thing to make a suboptimal choice because you have other incentives, but it's another thing altogether for him to know from the start that it would work out as bad as it has. It's been an absolute failure of epic proportions, but I think a lot of people actually thought it could work.

I really hope this 'bob' guy gets caught and outed soon. It's good that Erik is pursuing the criminal angle here on behalf of the company, as I assume if it was a strictly a personal matter for him and someone had stolen his own personal funds he might not see criminal charges as a valid option.

It's obviously just some kind of marketing bs. The multisig is meaningless if it's setup like it appears to be.
It's about the same as having 2FA on your computer rather than a separate device. You put your password in and then generate your token with an app on your desktop. It's meaningless since you're only authorizing from one machine with no separation. And it appears that Bitfinex was acting in a similar manner, they sign their key and then give some sort of signal for BitGo auto-authorize the withdrawal. I hope I'm wrong here, because it sounds ridiculous to use such a system as an alternative to traditional actual cold wallets that are cryptographically secure and only susceptible to physical security breaches.

The reality is and always has been that it's not great at consumer payments in general, and especially in person consumer payments. It's not a big deal, but apparently this reality shatters many people's perception of what they thought was going to make them rich. Or something like that.

Something like this in writing would be much better than some nebulous 'social contract' that everyone has their own personal perception of what it is and what it isn't.
It seems a lot of people behind Classic genuinely feel that their own social contract of what Bitcoin was supposed be(on chain scaling over decentralization I guess?) is being violated. Although what you're suggesting here is different and specifically for how miners should act.
Even now I don't like the SPV mining that goes on. But the people who do it obviously think that no one cares enough for it to affect their profitability. But if the community at large lay down some explicit expectations of how miners should act(with the consequences of violation being a potential change in PoW) then at least they'll know exactly what lines they shouldn't cross. And that would shift some power back to the community I think as well.

If all this acting as if he doesn't really understand the underlying issues and such is just him feigning ignorance that's pretty shady.
Maybe I'm naive, but I think he believes the stuff he says/tweets. Now saying that, there are definitely other people involved with Classic who are operating at a much more duplicitous level. But Roger has probably been mislead more than anything based on what I've seen.

I think we're passed the point where anyone is going to get 'rich' off BTC now. The upside potential now isn't like what it was back when Bitcoin was a few dollars. People who are already rich can become richer. Regular people who invested 1k, 5k, maybe 10k can get some excellent returns maybe 10 or 20xing their money if things go really well. But that's a far cry from getting rich off BTC. That ship has likely sailed.

The thing is that 75% miner support and 28 day timer to fork doesn't necessarily imply anything other than just the miner support. Classic's strategy in January and leading into February with the code release was to try to ram through this hard fork. And they tried to do so by misrepresenting the amount of consensus they had. A lot of people were told, and a lot of people believed that Classic actually had that consensus. And while the plan failed due to people sounding the alarms and calling out the bullshit, it probably could have worked. And that's pretty scary.


Well, no one has control over Bitcoin. Especially not me. I don't see how rejecting Classic because I think it's inferior is sabotage. Classic represents a very specific political movement among what appears to be small but not insignificant amount of Bitcoiners. If someone isn't on board for that they can either walk away or try to continue what they were doing before. It's possible that trying to continue the 'old' chain would end up in failure, sure, but I don't see any harm in trying if that's what people believe is the superior economic and technical configuration and team working on it. And really I think as long as a lot of the same people stay around, that as a decentralized cryptocurrency it will very likely be able to outcompete the Classic chain.
If selling BTC on the Classic chain and trying to work on stuff separate from that counts as trying to 'burn it to the ground', then I guess we're all just economic arsonists.

Based on everything I've read from multiple experts and academics it would seem Satoshi's comment from 2010 is one that is not true for 2016 if we take decentralization in to account. There were so many unknown variables back then, and I think we can forgive him for not being omniscient.

The thing is though that the speed of development and the enhancements are right now better then they've ever been. Two years ago I thought that Bitcoin was likely to stagnate and there would be very little innovation. In 2016 it's far better than I could have ever expected.
Yes, Bitcoin companies are failing. People threw a lot of money at a lot of nothing.
Yes, unsurprisingly big players don't want to use Bitcoin, they'd rather create their own systems. That is not surprising in the slightest. I always posed the question of 'what incentive do these organizations have to actually use Bitcoin itself?'. And the only answer people really had is 'network effect'. So yeah, I can't say I'm surprised about that one either. Why would they want to make a bunch of Bitcoiners rich when they can take their billions and do what they're doing now with Blythe and such? Enough people here have their straws into that pool too now, everyone and their brother now has some kind of 'blockchain' company trying to get a piece of the action there. Good for them, no reason why people shouldn't capitalize on their years of experience here in this space.
People had some ridiculous expectations of what they thought was going to happen with Bitcoin. But the good thing is that now the community (minus a certain subsection) is more mature and realistic, and the technology itself is looking better than ever. So as long as distractions like Classic can be kept at a minimum, Bitcoin keeps progressing and if there's really demand for a decentralized, secure financial instrument like Bitcoin then time will tell. For now Bitcoin seems alone in that space with very little serious competition as the primary product.

He playing the political game again and moving the goalposts to the very vague general idea of 2MB blocks on the Bitcoin network. Trying to equate people not outright rejecting the idea of eventually having 2MB blocks with support for Classic. It's annoying that he's still playing the game. I don't know why, but I kind of assumed he would have stopped by now.

It might be able to survive an attack by a powerful government, but just surviving isn't necessarily good. It could be heavily damaged economically if confidence is lost due to a wide scale crackdown or something similar.
Like for now, China seems fine with Bitcoin. But there's so much mining going on there now that if they seriously decided to step in and physically take over or shut down big mining operations it would be a big deal. They can't kill it, but if they really wanted to they could limit its potential by actively attempting to prevent people from using it.
China has the mining, but the US has a lot of the Bitcoin economic infrastructure. Any sort of war on Bitcoin by the US would be bad news. So I think it's best to avoid giving them any reason to start thinking it's a threat.
@_date: 2016-04-13 09:36:11
'tipping' in general is a very US-centric concept anyway.

Except your opponent in this particular case has virtually unlimited resources. Hashrate attacks are just one potential angle of attack and it's not a one shot type of deal. Yet it gets cheaper and cheaper the lower the price of BTC goes. So think about how it would play out if the NSA was willing to spend some serious cash on it.

Why doesn't someone just build something similar that's entirely web based? If people on OB have to run their own servers/stores anyway, why is it on an entirely separate network that's off-web rather than something that does the same thing but runs as a simple http server? Google is the most powerful tool available, and shutting any business off from that just seems counter productive.
What's the design or engineering reasoning behind building a network that's completely separate from the web? If there was privacy or redundancy or something then I could see that(nodes privately serve all the shops and such and they act like hidden services), but from what I can tell it doesn't offer any of that, and removes the inherent network effect of the web.

Every single issue that's been pointed out thus far by Classic supporters has been a wallet level issue as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2016-08-01 12:33:39
I know that the ETH/ETC hard fork isn't directly comparable, but I still think it's somewhat comparable because the minority chain will likely have to at the very least manually lower the difficulty, or replace the difficulty algo in general, and maybe change the PoW algo for security reasons. So the minority Bitcoin chain will also probably have to do its own hard fork to survive.
I didn't mean to imply that you supported Classic necessarily, which is why I used the general term 'people'. 
I support a hard fork with consensus at some point in the future when it's appropriate too.

Because you have to host your own store on the clearnet similar to how you can host your own website. Which opens you up to the same censorship issues you have when hosting a website. Considering Amir's political views I doubt he would really consider the result of OB in the same spirit as what I'd imagine his philosophy would be behind Darkmarket. As far as anarchism goes, Amir is just about as extreme as anyone.
Not that there is any obligation at all for the OB people to carry on his political philosophy through their own project. Nor would I expect them to or anything. Just saying that it's different.

Part of the reason Poloniex is so great though is that they don't deal with fiat at all. Which means they're good for any crypto to crypto trading and have very minimal KYC stuff, but if you're buying or selling BTC for USD they're not a replacement for those service providers.

Why do you think that?
Personally I see it more like it's more interesting or entertaining for him to try to push the limits of Bitcoin. And so his risk profile is far more liberal than most, and he thinks of it more of as an experiment than most are comfortable with. I think he's probably pretty financially secure and Bitcoin failing might not have much of an effect on his lifestyle. So the consequences for him personally are minimal. But the upside potential may be quite high.
If that's really how he feels it's kind of selfish to push so hard when there's clearly many people involved in Bitcoin who don't agree with his aggressive strategy. But I can see where he's coming from and I'm sure there are a decent amount of people who are on board with 'moon right now or bust' mindset. I personally don't think it's very responsible, but people are welcome to try act in whatever way they feel is in their self interest.
I don't think he wants the price to tank, rather some people like him are prepared to follow a path where a higher risk of that is an acceptable trade off.

There doesn't have to be anyone to co-opt to economically destroy Bitcoin though. It won't take much.

@_date: 2016-04-09 12:53:20


It's not nearly the same thing imo. Because a hard fork to Classic represents what many people would consider a failure condition for Bitcoin. Maybe Hearn's failure condition of XT not being accepted is somewhat similar, but I don't think it is since lack of change(XT failure) and a major change via contentious hard fork(Classic successfully hard forking) are quite different from where I'm sitting.






I think we'll be getting a 2MB hard fork or something similar with Core anyway at some point, so you'll probably have it all eventually.


I'm not sure what you're referencing here. Adam Back and others at the Hong Kong roundtable? If so, they're the ones who are advocating/agreed to a 2MB hard fork, so if anything it sounds like that's a change you want to see.


This is not what I bought in to, this is not the bitcoin I have been telling people about over the years and currently I don't mention it to anyone these days as I really don't know what will happen with this experiment.
Seems there are a fair amount of people who feel this way, and it's unfortunate, but the community historically has stifled criticism and debate over the years. Which seems to have resulted in quite a few people with some unrealistic expectations of what a decentralized Bitcoin is capable of. Personally I sympathize with people who feel like they've been mislead, but at least now I believe the community has improved in this regard and isn't quite the hivemind pump machine that it once was, silencing any dissent with shouts of 'FUD' or 'trolling'. 
@_date: 2016-04-30 15:08:47


Which is surprising, as you would think someone who is known to hold such a large stake in BTC would realize that he's costing himself far, far more money by damaging Bitcoin the way he has been. The pennies he gains from assisting the division to drive people to his website and sub are in reality costing him way, way more than he's ever going to gain back by being the overlord of the most toxic and anti-intellectual people in the Bitcoin community.

I think you're over reacting to their post. I'm not sure why you think they are suggesting that.
Also, if you do in fact do six figure volume then I think you're probably a bit naive to think that you haven't drawn any attention to yourself. Banks are required to report transactions over $10k, and that's just completely standard across the board.

If someone threw another million dollars at them right now with the express purpose of it all being spent on design, UX, and marketing professionals, what do you think would be different? It would take some kind of special magic to make a network that seems fundamentally inferior to the web attractive for commerce. Not only that, but we already know that Bitcoin itself is inferior to credit cards for consumer purchases, consumer protection, and general consumer experience(and you know that from your own first hand experience as an online retailer). So they'd have to work two miracles there anyway.
I think a team that could somehow turn such a fundamentally disadvantageous position into a consumer success would probably be deserving of an award recognizing them as the greatest marketing team of the century. When you're competing against the world wide web, the greatest network in human history(and I know we all love to talk about network effects here), as well Google and Amazon, who are probably going to continue to further their technological domination of modern society, I don't think it can be really understated just how big that mountain is to climb here. If someone can pull it off I'll bow down to them and be happy to do so, because they'll probably be in every business textbook published for the next 50 years.
@_date: 2016-04-09 07:27:33
Right, and the only other proposed alternative right now with code is a hard fork away from all the top talent in Bitcoin development to give us...wait for it...an increase to 2MB. As you said:

Hell, even the Federal Reserve is constructed in a way that's intended to be somewhat decentralized. Obviously not by Bitcoin standards, but the idea behind it is not as crazy as many people seem to think.

If you're going to eventually take it back if it doesn't get redeemed make sure to write on it something like "good for 1 year" or something like that at least and try to make sure they understand. Someone could actually like it and just decide to hold the BTC in the paper wallet indefinitely. It would suck for them if BTC ever blew up and they thought they had a bunch of money they could redeem when they didn't actually.

If 21 eventually had like 30% or more of the network(in a hopefully decentralized manner, p2pool v2 as they said) it could work quite well including device transactions for free on chain in a reasonable amount of time I think. Free on chain transactions could open up a lot of use cases maybe. And saving a few cents on every transaction could also in a sense add to the ROI of buying a 21 device in a roundabout way. Especially if we keep seeing high transaction fees like we sometimes have.
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:29:09
Thanks for the detailed answer. I've been curious for a while about how it was all divided up.
@_date: 2015-12-20 13:16:42
Bitcoin doesn't work well with microtransactions due to the relatively high fees percentage wise.
The flipside to that since it's a flat fee it becomes extremely cheap to send larger amounts of money.
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:51:21
I disagree. Those are actually really useful terms in context with Bitcoin. Settlements can take various forms, but one relevant and realistic form that we will be seeing in the near future is the settlement of off chain transactions on the blockchain. n number of payments will be settled on the blockchain with some of the new technology that's being developed.
@_date: 2015-12-07 11:40:26
It should be the reverse. The hash rate follows the price.

What's wrong with n of m signing? PoW would be the last thing you'd want to use on a distributed permissioned ledger. And there's no need for any unit of account or reward.

There are a few different projects that are working on inter-blockchain operability. To me the big question is whether we end up with all other relevant blockchains just sidechained to Bitcoin, or if they'll be independent and people will use some protocol to transact between them. Either way is fine for me, at this point I'm pretty sure that Bitcoin itself isn't going to handle everything itself.

I agree that the more lopsided the ratio is the more dangerous it is for the fork with less hash power.

Segregated witness, which should effectively increase the amount of transactions able to be stored in a block by 2-4 times from what I understand.

And then there's privacy related stuff that gmaxwell is working on like confidential transactions. And I'm sure his gears are turning about ways to implement privacy focused sidechains and such.

Not on the day when it got hacked/exploited(or whatever term you want to use).
Of course the ledger was reversed to the previous block. Else we wouldn't be having the conversation right now.
Also, calling the Bitcoin the only unhackable database is really naive. And not because it was exploited in the way that the person you replied to mentioned, but because there's many security configurations that can result in something more secure than Bitcoin. The only interesting question is if something can be both as secure and as decentralized. Launching an attack on Bitcoin is not cheap, but it's not nearly as secure as what we may see in the future, as I roughly described in a post I made earlier today: 
That would be incredibly secure and fairly decentralized. It wouldn't be 'permissionless' though, so it's not an apples to apples comparison. But security wise a properly constructed n of m scheme is always going to win over something that by its nature is permissionless, and thus allows anyone to participate, including attackers. Given that the cryptography is sound of course, which applies for Bitcoin as well.

I don't know the specifics, but that doesn't sound particularly confusing to me. Them integrating that technology in to their cloud infrastructure would just allow people to deploy it using Microsoft's servers, right?
Some people use Amazon's AWS stuff to bootstrap new blockchains, but they do it all manually. I'm guessing having this stuff integrated just makes it easier to do.
I think it would be pretty cool if Amazon integrated Bitcoin blockchain deployment, and you could start your own chain with a few options specified via command line. 
People have been offering similar services to launch altcoins for years now, coingen for a hundred bucks or whatever. Having cloud providers provide that service for cheap or free sounds like a logical step from there, and a good service.

So? People were naive and optimistic. The Bitcoin community has always had problems with objective self analysis. Since so many people are heavily invested in BTC it was often like pulling teeth to get anyone to deal with harsh realities and limitations. And anyone who tried to discuss the tough topics was often dismissed as a troll.
Things haven gotten better over the years though. Less people are spouting misinformation and people are more open discussions that don't follow the whole 'pump' narrative of Bitcoin is perfect and it's going to take over the world. I don't think many people still hold the delusion that Bitcoin is going to replace the global financial system anytime soon. But that was a surprising common view over the years.

When you think of 'using Bitcoin' for this type of thing, what were you expecting? Isn't throwing a hash on an immutable ledger pretty much what we would expect a company to be doing by using Bitcoin?
I'm not a fan of 'Bitcoin as a Database' type usage at all other than the most basic handful of transactions that result in timestamping/proof of existence/putting a hash on the blockchain. I don't think it makes sense at all for anything more than that given the transaction fees.

I'm curious how it's actually going to go. But in general I don't get my hopes up since over the years there have been quite a few things that were built up to be game changers, but the only thing I can think of that really caused a paradigm shift in the last few years has been the emergence of Chinese exchanges. Other than that things have been underwhelming to say the least.

Here's a couple of the threads that were on here: 
@_date: 2015-12-31 16:00:24


I get in a lot of discussions here about 'blockchain technology' and for the most part I don't really think that's the case. Mainly because none of these projects have(publicly at least) given any indication that they plan to issue any form of cryptocurrency on their blockchains or distributed ledgers. 
Using the blockchain data structure without cryptocurrency is interesting, and I don't really doubt that some of these newly created fintech companies are going to produce some improvements for banks and other financial organizations. But I feel it's really just fundamentally different than Bitcoin. 
For now maybe the blockchain posts are interesting. They seem to push some buttons with a lot of the posters here and invoke some emotional reactions(mostly dismissive or negative). But eventually I think they'll be pushed to the side as off topic, as there isn't really much to discuss as it relates to Bitcoin. The lack of cryptocurrency means that they're not even competitors to Bitcoin. 
Altcoins are actually more on topic if you consider that their technology is either  directly competing with Bitcoin, or it's technology that Bitcoin may choose to assimilate at some point. Either through sidechains or more direct integration. And altcoin discussion seems to have been heavily censored as a policy for as long as I can remember, with the very odd post slipping through once in a while. So from a consistency stand point, it doesn't make much sense to censor one while allowing the other. I'd probably prefer no censorship of anything, but that's obviously not the policy here.
Also strongly agree with disliking those political posts that you mentioned. Even though I'm against censorship, having to deal with those all the time is definitely annoying.

I was pretty skeptical in general until I saw someone mention the actual numbers and it turned out that the chip was actually very efficient and actually produces more BTC than it burns on even fairly high kWh rates. That doesn't mean it will offer a positive ROI of course, but I was under the impression that it would lose money compared to the cost of electricity which apparently isn't true. I was thinking something like it would cost you $15 to pay for a $9.99 Netflix subscription or something which wouldn't seem to be the case right now. Who knows how it will be in the future though if the difficulty rises/block reward reduction.
@_date: 2015-12-10 09:06:52
First off, be weary of people contacting you privately now trying to 'help' now that they know you might be coming in to a decent sum of BTC soon. There are lots of opportunistic scammers out here. Be careful about clicking links, and definitely don't download and run anything.
Cashing out $40k BTC in general is no problem, the market regularly turns over tens of millions of dollars per day in volume. Cashing it out immediately as someone who doesn't have verified accounts on sites like Coinbase is harder since they're a regulated American company that has to comply with local laws. But if you're willing to verify your identity and such with them you will eventually be able to cash out all of the bitcoin. Maybe have a discussion with Coinbase support first and they can give you an overview of what they're going to want from you exactly in terms of verification. 
If you want to take out smaller chunks of it quicker, you can find some people buying BTC on localbitcoins.com. This is just a person to person exchange, but the site acts as the escrow and is reputable. There may be some scammers on there, but there are also many professional traders who have high feedback and high volumes.
I'm not familiar with the escrow service that the person offering the contract is using, so I can't help you there.
Assuming you're American, I guess I can sum up the advice as open a Coinbase account and get it verified as soon as you can. Coinbase is well known and well funded, with many high profile investors including the NYSE: 
Also, using two-factor authentication on your phone to help protect your Coinbase account is a must. As is making sure the computer or smartphone you use to do all this is clean and malware free.

Well yeah ASIC designers, mining hardware manufacturers, and some miners working at scale are probably doing quite well. But that's kind of a specialized sub-section of the Bitcoin economy.
So far I don't think there have been very many consumer facing companies like Purse who have been growing at a good rate. And when you look at how many companies and how much money was invested in the Bitcoin sector it's good to see at least some promise of a successful business model taking shape.
If Purse truly does have a handle on fraud prevention like they claime then it's great to see real growth. Hopefully more companies will have similar results.

Yeah, I've said a few times on here that realistically any decent group of organizations with a sane block-signing protocol can easily create a more secure blockchain than Bitcoin's. But really no one seems interested in doing anything related to cryptocurrency right now so it's far from being any sort of 'threat' to Bitcoin.
The 'more decentalized' thing is debatable, and really depends on how they set it up, but if they wanted to make it pretty decentralized they could. It just wouldn't be permissionless.

How is a decentralized blockchain with its own method of distributed consensus not fundamentally different than those? The only difference between what I described and Bitcoin is PoW is inherently permissionless in theory, anyone can calculate hashes and mine a block. Which makes it fundamentally different than Bitcoin, yes, but still ticks all the other boxes except the permissionless one(and the cryptocurrency one, probably).
I far as I know ACH/SEPA/SWIFT are not decentralized immutable blockchains where the ledger is decided by distributed consensus by cryptographic signatures.

Programmable money. Smart contacts in crypto-dollars backed by regular dollars? Lots of people who wouldn't touch Bitcoin for various reasons will love this idea.

It's almost like they knew if they lay it all out upfront that people would know its BS right away. I mean, in the end there was no evidence at all.

I haven't seen anything to indicate that any bank or organization is interested in creating a cryptocurrency.
If the worlds top banks get together to create their own decentralized cryptocurrency where 20+ banks are signing off on blocks and anyone can use the currency itself as we can now with Bitcoin, I'd be worried. But so far what they seem to be interested is in completely unrelated to Bitcoin. They just want distributed ledgers, not money.
I don't think the banks would even have the balls to create their own currency. Too much of an aggressive political move for them considering they're still under the thumb of governments. Maybe in the future they might try something like that as a power grab.

Maybe, but they were paying some dev salaries for a while so a good chunk of it would have been for that. From the beginning I don't think they had a sustainable financial model or anything other than relying on BTC to continue to exponentially increase.
The thing too is that all of the money and past decisions were made by people who are no longer involved at this point I believe. Although if I were them I'd probably just trash the Bitcoin Foundation entirely and start a new organization if they're that serious about trying to make something happen. Otherwise you get posts like these where they get tripped up on shit like old bylaws that were implemented by someone else. Not to mention the Bitcoin Foundation name in general carries a lot of baggage.
It's good that people are still trying to do things that they believe will add value to Bitcoin overall though. They ran a dev conference recently and I keep seeing positive mentions on here about that, so stuff like that is good no matter how controversial all the other issues are surrounding the organization are.

Especially considering Intel's latest mobile chips(z8300/8500/8700) are built with a 14nm process(not that they're directly comparable, I just happened to notice because I was shopping for a x86 mobile device).

That's simply not true at all. You can have a permissioned blockchain secured by an n of m blocksigning scheme.

As long as they're using a half way sane system of n of m signing, there should be virtually no chance of hacking unless we see some major failure of established cryptography.
They could easily make it more secure than Bitcoin's blockchain by properly distributing keys around the world's financial centers and organizations. Combined with the existing state security that exists(police, military) the dollar cost to mount a successful attack would be hard to calculate. It would be something unprecedented in human history. Even if we say it costs a billion dollars now to launch a 51% attack on our current Bitcoin blockchain, that doesn't seem comparable to commandeering a large number of private keys from the richest organizations on earth who are also supported and protected by existing states.
I mean, maybe the US could pull it off. Would probably result in WWIII though. Or maybe not if they went back to Cold War style nuclear threats. But see how silly and speculative this gets? The idea that a consortium of banks can't secure a set of private keys is absurd. And consider the fact that each n of m key for each organization would likely be a result of a lower level(or multiple levels) of n of m. Maybe HSBC's key that is one of the n in the m that signs blocks on the real deal r3 chain, but the local key functions when signed with its own 5 of 9 that would require 5 separate major security breaches within HSBC. And even then that's just a single key that's compromised. How many banks are in this thing? 42? 22 of 42 to sign blocks?

Pools are fine, but these days the Chinese mining farms are huge.

It can easily be vastly more secure than Bitcoin. You don't think that global banks can secure some private keys better than we can protect some Chinese miners from their authoritarian government? Or even in a non-takeover attack where someone spends a large amount of money to buy enough hashing hardware to attack the network, the cost is far less than what it would take to attack or coerce banks in multiple global financial centers at once. Even if we get to the point where it would cost a billion dollars to attack Bitcoin's blockchain, that's nothing compared to launching an attack on multiple organizations protected by state forces(police, military).
It's just different than Bitcoin since it's permissioned and not really an apples to apples comparison. Whether it's more decentralized if it were run with 30 banks as I suggested is debatable given Bitcoin mining has concentrated itself in China the last three years. I hope that mining redecentalizes itself and stops the centralization trend so that Bitcoin becomes so decentralized that it's not even a question whether it's more decentralized then even a 100 banks. 
The thing is too that I haven't heard any mention of banks being interested in issuing their own cryptocurrency. So it terms of whether all this blockchain stuff is a competitor to Bitcoin, or even relevant at all, for now I don't think it is at all since it looks like it's going to be so different with an entirely separate purpose than Bitcoin. I do believe they will easily be able to make it ultra-secure though.

It's weird, because I've been reading this as the main crux of the blocksize conservative argument.

Yes, the whole thing being based on economic assumption that Bitcoin will continue to appreciate over a long period of time is kind of crazy when you think about it. Doesn't make Bitcoin any less cool or anything, and it BTC certainly could continue to appreciate. But I'm not thrilled about the fact that sustaining the long term security of the network first rests on demand outstripping supply, and then after when the block reward becomes less significant, fees alone. Especially when it's clear that off chain commerce is going to likely be a major part of the Bitcoin economy.
I think in ~2020 when we go down to 6.25 BTC per block we'll be a tipping point. If the network can sustain or grow its level of security(which follows price) then things will look ok. But if network security shrinks in response to lowered block rewards it might be the beginning of a downward spiral.

So if they had a major incident and there was a significant loss it could really undermine faith in Bitcoin by all the newer people that were given a false impression. That's just the reality of the situation, not saying it's a good thing, just that we're still in a phase where lots of people rely on Coinbase.

Given how often there have been disasters with Bitcoin companies and exchanges, it's simply the market pricing in its perceived risk.
Bitfinex was apparently built off the old Bitcoinica code that Amir mistakenly open sourced. And they're somewhat known for having technical issues with trading. So it's not a stretch to say that there's some risk there. Whether or not the reward outweighs the risk is the big question. And at 11.5% it's pretty clear that the market believes it's fairly risky.
I think it's probably a positive expectation investment at those rates personally. I wouldn't be throwing everything on there though obviously.

But he's saying it was at the time, and he was ignored. One month later the exploit was fixed. But don't you agree that if what he claims is true, and it was a valid working exploit at the time of reporting(that incidentally maybe have been independently discovered and fixed), he should get a bounty rather than just an 'informative'?
If his report of the situation is accurate some people are going to think that someone at Coinbase read his report, closed his case on hackerone and then took that information and fixed the exploit on their own to avoid paying him. Now personally I give Coinbase the benefit of the doubt since doing something like that seems like poor practice, and it was probably just a coincidence. But still if what he's saying is true(and he seems to be pretty insistent about it), giving $5k for the first exploit and then zero for the second seems very inconsistent.

There's incentive for Bitcoin users to create sidechains to add utility to Bitcoin, but the incentives related to securing the sidechain itself are not as clear and simple as it is with a standalone chain, since all the tokens are fixed to BTC. If the sidecoins are just fixed to BTC, there's no way to increase their value other than BTC itself increasing. Which is an incentive, but it's a different proposition than the existing status quo with standalone blockchains.
Merge mining with Bitcoin itself might work, but there seem to be a lot of people skeptical of the security of that alone.

And considering they just had a whole conference in Hong Kong discussing it openly it's kind of hard to agree. I for one as an observer feel that their communication about the current issues facing us has been at the very least fine, and probably better than fine really.

Well other people claim that Chinese miners could effectively collude to use larger blocks to win more races and drive further centralization behind the great firewall since their connection between themselves is fine. Are they incorrect? I don't know.
Yes, their connection to the outside world is not good. Also, whether the Chinese miners realize the stated large block centralization scenario or not isn't really relevant. Actually it's good if they're not actively thinking of ways to collude and harm Bitcoin(obviously). But that doesn't mean that we can ignore potential issues because we trust them not to take advantage. Or maybe we can trust them if the community decides to.

I believe the issue is more related to power costs rather than access to hardware. Apparently at least some of the Chinese farms are getting cheap hydro-electric power that's costing them around 1 or 2 cents per kWh. With the average home residential rate being an order of magnitude higher than that, it's just not economic.

Pretty much all of the Law Enforcement/DOJ agencies are completely fucked up from what I can tell. Legislation is shit. Homeland Security is ridiculous, especially the TSA. Department of Education may or may not be doing a good job with what they're given, but the results are bad(it may not be their fault though, not sure). 
Federal Reserve seems to do a pretty good job of keeping inflation around their targeted rate of 1-2% or so. There have been a couple of bumps a while back, but in my lifetime inflation has been fine and consistent. And transparency wise they're much better than most people seem to think. Especially in comparison to other agencies:

Just saying because in many countries you just do an instant bank transfer from your online banking app or site and then the person you're trading with releases the BTC. 
I'm not saying that doing this is easy for random people, but I'm wondering how Paxful has improved upon this and made it easier for people.

Any reasonably sized government can take down Bitcoin as well, what's your point?
The database comment that's so often used on here is just a semantic game. Whether or not different organizations use actual distibuted and/or decentralized blockchains, or some new form of distributed ledger that doesn't use a blockchain data structure is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is that whatever data structures are used, or whatever technologies are used they don't exist today and there are many companies building various implementations that are made to offer some combination of the attributes I originally listed.
People saying that they can implement a distributed, cryptographically secure ledger built on top of some existing database framework are welcome to go collect some of that billion dollar plus VC money that's flooding into the sector. Not only that, but I've seen who appears to know what he's talking about argue on here that trying to achieve all the desired characteristics in existing database software is no walk in the park.

The thing is that when someone sells something on Amazon, both Amazon and the seller make money. So Amazon is incentivized to provide the best possible user experience and optimize their own site towards maximizing sales. As well as bringing as many people to Amazon.com as they can to browse around.
So having no fees might be nice, but it is possible that someone like Amazon actually provides a similar(or maybe more in somecases) amount of value to a seller then they charge in fees.
I hope OB works out, but as far as it competing with something like Amazon I'm highly skeptical for many different reasons. Decentralization doesn't inherently make anyone more money, and the bottom line is going to be what it comes down to when it comes to commerce.

This person who seems to be in contact with all of the major miners gave me some interesting numbers eariler: 
So if 75% of Antpool is their own local hardware with the remaining being people using their pool, and Bitfury and BW.com are all their own hardware, that's already dangerously close to 50% of the hashrate being mined on Chinese soil. There's probably enough other hardware around to put it above 50%. I hope there isn't but it's pretty close.
Each bank's master key that they sign blocks with can also be unlocked by its own n of m scheme to help protect against a single person abusing it. 5 of 9 or similar with the sub-keys geographically separated, something like that anyway.

Close to zero imo.
I love Bitcoin but I also think for international bank level commerce it would be irresponsible for them to rely on something like Bitcoin's blockchain at this stage. They could easily create a permissioned ledger that's orders of magnitude more secure than Bitcoin's blockchain. Even if attacking Bitcoin now requires hundreds of millions of dollars, a consortium with organizations like r3 with that could easily devise a blockchain that is secure beyond a simple &gt;50% attack like Bitcoin is by nature always inherently vulnerable to. When permissionlessness and PoW is irrelevant they can create a security paradigm with a sane n of m signing scheme where an attack moves far beyond something that you can simply quantify with a cost estimate, and on to historical world changing events like war or political coercion.
A couple of posts I've made recently on similar subjects, second one describes how an r3 bank blockchain might be secured: 
Bitcoin is cool and fun because it's decentralized and permissionless, but really we're not even talking about the same thing here. What they have the power to create is far beyond what we have in terms of blockchain security, and Bitcoin seems quaint in comparison. Doesn't make Bitcoin worse or anything, it's just different and I can't imagine why some of the most powerful and wealthy organizations on earth would ever decide to rely on a bunch of miners in China(who when it comes down to it are subject to an authoritarian communist government) when they can easily create their own ultra secure blockchain(s) that they can control between themselves. I'm not really a fan of banks, but it just seems irrational for them to ever rely on Bitcoin to that extent when they're already so powerful. Bitcoin makes sense for us, the people. Not so much for the already established power structures.

Tasks that benefit from parallelation. I believe Balaji was the one who branded Bitcoin as 'embarrassingly parallel'.
Saw this a a day or two ago and was wondering why it wasn't being discussed more here. Everyone agrees that quantum computing is a very real danger for Bitcoin. Saving grace being that we can always change the algo to be more quantum resistant. I hope there's a solid plan of action if it turns out that we're going to need to do that. And I also hope that we know in advance, rather than having some opportunistic researcher with access to one of the computers do something that's going to cause damage.

I disagree vehemently with many of the policies on this sub, but hiding scores is fairly common around reddit, and can help stop people just mindlessly upvoting or downvoting something just because they see other people doing it. So it might be an improvement here since that's pretty common in this sub. 
Normally they set it to hide scores for a couple of hours before showing them again. Not sure what the policy is here right now. Probably 1-4 hours though I'm guessing. edit: People pointed out that you can hover to see the time and it seems my guess was way off.

In all seriousness though if crypto-commerce is going to flow away from Bitcoin, I really hope it goes somewhere more advanced than Litecoin.

Yes, but that group consists of those who could single-handedly do the most damage should they choose to(or be coerced to). Also the ones operating in China represent an easy target for the Chinese government to attack Bitcoin should it desire to do so.
That 6 billion dollar market cap definitely rests on the assumption that the Bitcoin network is safe and secure. If that were to no longer be the case it's not too much of a stretch to assume it would shrink to a much smaller value.

Outside the US, many countries in Europe and Asia also offer instant free p2p interbank domestic transactions. Bitcoin was never ahead in this game anyway, so don't worry about it too much. It only seemed like an advantage to people living in the US who are stuck with their archaic banking system.
Bitcoin's value in the long run is not going to come with directly competing against centralized finance in speed, cost, or availability of small everyday transactions. There might be some short term advantages in places like the US, but eventually even the US will upgrade their systems. It's not something we should rely on. Moving big money may be competitive though if Bitcoin's market continues to grow in liquidity on an international scale.

Their cheap power is like 1 or 2 cents per kWh and they're buying these units discounted at scale. I'm not sure what you think these companies are doing fabricating 16 nm chips and expanding their farms if they're losing money. Sure, over the years some companies get out competed. But there's definitely companies making profit. Some have even mentioned publicly that they'll still be able to profitably mine after the halving. And this was back when the price was much lower. Difficulty has shot up much higher the last few adjustments, but a lot of the big names are still hashing large percentages of the hashrate.

From what I read the mining chip itself is actually quite good and efficient, 50GH for 15w. If they wanted to release one with ten chips instead of one, it would be a different story all together. Also, they purposely locked the chip at 50GH to avoid dealing with people pushing it too hard and creating support issues/harming the UX. So theoretically it could be even better.
I wonder how much each chip costs them.

Sounds good to me. I wanted BIP 102 before this anyway as a stop gap measure.
Not sure about only needing 75% to go into effect. These recent soft forks have used 95% I believe, and seeing as it's a hard fork wouldn't a similarly high consensus be a good idea? Unless there's some fundamental difference here that I'm missing...

That amount might as well be penny shavings for China though.
What would be good though is having some high ranking government officials with personal interests in Bitcoin. Either through making money off the miner's electricity consumption(via corruption), actually owning some or all of a mining operation in China, or the best thing would be them owning significant amounts of BTC themselves.
China alone is the single biggest threat to Bitcoin. And I'm sure everyone would sleep a little easier if a bunch of the high ranking party officials had some self interest in keeping Bitcoin free and clear of any government interference.

Is that really an attainable market though? Large wire transfers are not very expensive to begin with. It's the small wire transfers where the flat $30 fee ends up costing a significant percentage. Plus Europe has SEPA that seems fairly decent, and in Asia there's multiple non-wire transfer ways to more or less instantly transfer money affordably or free, depending on the country.
Money transfers in general outside the US will be a hard market to compete in, because outside the US banking has actually evolved over the last 15 years to offer better options.

Surprised that people here are approaching this movie as something that Bitcoin would have prevented. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I did read the book and if anything it was a market failure that resulted from rating agencies incompetence, or possibly something more sinister. Also issues with large pension funds and incentives for the people who manage them.
Also, I haven't heard anyone argue yet(but I'm sure someone has) that less regulation would have prevented this. There was no incentive to prevent the investment banks from loading up the CDS/CDOs or whatever with absolutely shit loans, while adding a small tranche of AAA loans to exploit the idiotic way that the instruments were being rated by the ratings agencies. People who were ignorant of what they were buying were played. And even people who weren't ignorant of what they were buying, like that one pension fund manager who got paid whether they failed or not, were the ones playing the people whose pensions he was supposed to be managing. Was there any law against what they were doing? I haven't heard of any of the people who took part in this clusterfuck going to jail.

Emphasis mine. I hope this doesn't become a common way to refer to mining. Can just picture the media putting out stuff like "American company 21 Inc processed millions of dollars of terrorist funds, including ISIS."

How would it be a massive raid? You already have multiple farms setting up in the same area so they can tap in to that ultra cheap hydro electric power station. We've seen the pics, they're huge. Add in a few other mining farms and the Chinese government could have it under control in a matter of hours if they come prepared with people who have the technical knowledge to maintain the mining operations.
It would be a decent size raid I guess. But taking over say 5-10 mining farms in China wouldn't be very difficult.

Hopefully anyone who purchased a Trezor realized this beforehand. Part of the reason a Trezor makes sense is because Slush has been a member of the Bitcoin community for so long(he even invented pooled mining in 2010 as some might not know).

I don't see how the first is possible since the Bitcoin has to come from somewhere. Could maybe do something like someone else mentioned Etherum is doing in this thread, making an additional token that is two-way pegged with BTC. But that's not really the same thing.
But the second one sounds like something that will happen in the future with successful sidechains where the users decide to hard fork away from the two-way peg. If people feel that a sidechain is being held back by being pegged to BTC it would make sense to leave the nest so to speak. In a way sidechains might end up being an altcoin incubator where different technologies can be tested and grow without being dominated by the market forces that can negatively effect a developing free floating currency.
@_date: 2015-12-19 08:42:01

Fed's target is price inflation though, not money supply inflation. I don't think the fed has any money supply target at all and will print anything from 0% to infinite percent depending on what they think will result in prices inflating at an average of 1-2% per year. And maybe they would even destroy money if price inflation got too high. Theoretically at least, lol.

I thought a lot of the people against high block sizes believe that higher blocksizes can lead to further centralization in China. And that this is pretty much the biggest issue and biggest reason to be cautious and conservative.
It's already really bad, the massive shift towards mining centralization in China that's happened in the past couple of years or so. If something changes that allows that trend to continue or even increase it's potentially game over.
Imagine if 3 or 4 years ago someone said that over 50% of hashing on the Bitcoin network was going to be done in China, an authoritarian single party communist(when it's in their best interest) government, most people would probably say that this future is a failure.

I read Bitcointalk for many years and I think you might be slightly underestimating how common the concern was. Yes, tons of people answered 'we'll just raise the block size, easy. stop trolling with these arguments', and concerns were often drowned out and ignored(and I bet we could probably find a lot of people now raising alarms guilty of that now too). But the concern was definitely there. Especially from technically inclined outsiders and others who may have had an interest in Bitcoin, but weren't full on drinking the koolaid like so many on bitcointalk.
Honestly, it seems like the most common first impression that a non-biased technically inclined person has when taking a look a Bitcoin was 'it won't scale'. I think if people weren't so motivated by price pumping over the years and more objective it would have been better addressed earlier. I do understand why so many feel like they were mislead. It's the same dismissive price pumping cheerleading squad that has always existed.

Yes, and the people who decide what gets merged determined that a scheduled hard fork that would take the current 1MB block size and set it at 20MB was a poor idea.


He can be as rigorous as he wants on his own ideas, but at the end of the day what matters is the peer review. And I've read many of the opinions of his peers on here, the mailing list, IRC ect and I found very few people in the technical community seem to agree with his ideas related to scaling over the last year or so. Especially the 20MB proposition that started this debate. He put his reputation on the line and claimed that he had researched that and it was safe. He was wrong.




A two week old project that's aiming to hard fork Bitcoin and alienate a large part of the technical community who have expressed explicit support for Core should have very high standards. The numbers are less important than the actual people. And based on what I've seen I think someone would be crazy to choose Classic over Core.
As for the last question, I'm not really sure how to answer. Having the code work is a necessary condition to having the system run to begin with, so I guess you could say it's more important only because it's fundamental. But I don't think that it's a substitute for economic decision making. Ideally you would have both. Setting the economic formula for Bitcoin is very important, I don't necessarily think it's optimized right now or anything. So far we've just taken what Satoshi presumably thought was the best configuration and run with it. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:58:47
Well it seems he's not the only one that feels they were deceived about Classic, although he has that specific issue of being told it was going to be a soft fork.
Good for him though for seeing through the Classic bullshit and realizing they're just trying to fork as a political maneuver to increase their power over Bitcoin and remove the Core devs entirely. Reading this makes me happy to see that they are able to quickly correct their mistake of publicly supporting Classic as soon as things become clear.
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:41:51
Considering at the time Gavin convinced himself that a hard fork from 1MB to 20MB full stop was the right thing to do and safe the beer hat analogy isn't far off.
He may be a reasonably good software developer overall, but when it comes to *Bitcoin*, compared to Wlad, Pieter, and Greg he might as well be the beer hat guy. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 14:22:43
Doesn't really change the fact that if 50% of the physical(as opposed to pooled) hashing is not currently performed in China, it's pretty close and trending that way.
Pools are one thing, and they're not great(but something we can live with) since right now collusion between 2 or 3 pools have the ability to perform one attack(presumably people will pull their hash when they learn it's being used maliciously). But the real issues are:
1) The government subsidized power that enables Chinese farms to operate with extremely low overhead.
2) The fact that due to 1) and other factors(hardware manufacturing is probably one), mining continues to centralize in China.
3) Many technically inclined people whose opinions I respect have suggested that larger blocks will contribute to further mining centralization due to the Great Firewall slowing the relaying of their blocks. Since Chinese miners are pseudo-segregated from the rest of the world, this results in them being more likely to build off of each others blocks since there's no firewall slowing their domestic connections down. Some people believe that bigger blocks will actually re-decentralize Bitcoin mining though, because of the Great Firewall. If that's so people should be bringing this issue to the forefront and debating it, it's a big deal.
4) China has an authoritarian one party government. In the future they may have reason to believe that the existence of Bitcoin is at the very least assisting in capital outflows, and what they might view as harming their economy. There are many different situations that could result in the Chinese government seeing Bitcoin as a threat. We know that a single entity controlling 50% of the hash is a huge issue were it to occur, and the idea that the Chinese government might one day decide to take control of mining farms on their soil isn't exactly the most far fetched idea.
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:57:51
Well, that's a pretty reasonable concern really. That's probably the biggest existential threat to an economically successful Bitcoin.
And he sold when it was just Ghash. Now it's far, far worse. With huge miners likely obfuscating their hash as well as unashamedly ready to game whatever short term profits out of the system regardless of the long term value costs. Jihan Wu is a total shithead and a good example of a bad actor. Ghash shouldn't have let it get to where they did, but they eventually tried to work with the community and took action.
On the plus side if Bitcoin (economically) survives a bunch of centralized short term thinking Chinese miners then that's pretty huge.
@_date: 2016-03-05 15:27:24
I'm not angry about people who choose to leave. Especially if they do so based on an objective analysis of the situation. But it's hard to read lies and see people who have been manipulated and not feel anything at all.
edit to add:


Then Bitcoin is worthless anyway if someone can launch the tx spam attack, get the media writing some bullshit stories, and then parlay that into forcing everyone into something they don't want. And by everyone I mean the people involved in the economic and technical consensus of Bitcoin who have clearly made their opinions known recently and rejected Classic.

And why are people ignoring the fact that Core will soon effectively have ~2MB with segwit? But all of a sudden everyone must move to Classic because it will have 2MB? 
This feels like it's a purely political move. And it's really sad to see to be honest. I don't think people realize what kind of brain power and technical expertise is behind Core. And apparently many people are just willing to throw that away for nothing.
People have shifted this entire thing away from being a technical debate into a strawman about conspiracies. Despite the fact that the capacity increases document was signed by a large portion of the technical community that has a solid plan that will act as the first step.

I honestly don't blame you if you feel deceived. The Bitcoin community has been notorious over the years for misleading people about what Bitcoin actually is.

Oh, so people did end up agreeing on completely removing opt-in RBF? That's interesting.

Well I'm sure some pumpers have jumped on the bandwagon to try to cause more discord, but considering who's involved in Classic I think it's safe to say that it wasn't born as an attempt to pump ether.
Just a happy side effect for people probably. Unless you see Coinbase add ether in the next little while, and Gavin start getting involved I think their goal is control of the Bitcoin reference software, rather than anything to do with alts for now. Perhaps Classic will be launched as an alt with a different PoW though.

@_date: 2016-03-07 19:16:16


During what time frame? Do you have any more information about this?
If they said 'eventually', then yeah, eventually miners will have to be getting a similar amount in USD per transaction since it's not like the blockchain itself appears to be able to scale up to tens of thousands of tx per second and stay decentralized. So as the block subsidy winds down, if they don't start getting similar or greater compensation than what they get from the block subsidy for mining then Bitcoin has a good chance of failing. This is probably many years away though unless things go really well and off chain transactions flourish and growth explodes while the blocksize is kept smaller. If there's enough demand for high fee transactions to be included on chain like that. I wouldn't expect it anytime soon though. But that would be a good growth indicator.

If your answer is, I don't know yet, but I think someone will eventually develop some superior technology. Then I acknowledge that this could very well happen.

We just had a big discussion thread on this topic recently. From what I can tell, at least part of the reason Gavin does not think block size caps are necessary, or at least something like BIP 101 with massive increases is fine, is because he has no trouble with the idea that putting everything on chain will eventually put individual nodes out of reach for regular people.
Bitcoin could scale on chain that way, with data centers like I'd imagine Visa uses for their network. But I'm not so sure that's a very good path to follow if decentralization is the only thing that makes Bitcoin special.

If the question is 'how many objects can you fit in the pail?', then yes you have increased the capacity of the amount of objects in the pail by choosing a different type of object. And segwit, assuming wallet developers implement the changes they need to in order to take advantage of the upgrade(and there's no reason they shouldn't as far as I know), will increase the capacity of transactions that can be mined per block.
@_date: 2016-03-06 12:47:37
He could just vote by signing a message with a few of those unspent 50 BTC coinbase reward blocks from early 2009 and that would probably be sufficient. The eariler the better. Also if they're ones that were highlighted by Sergio Lerner in his research to be blocks likely mined by Satoshi then that should be fairly decent. 
Signing with the coinbase reward from the genesis block or the first one after that would be better. I might be a little too loose here on just taking a bunch of blocks from signed from early 2009 as sufficient evidence, but it would be something. The coinbase of the genesis block, or the one after that would be perfect though.

Uh, if the Chinese government has taken action that requires exchanges to stop BTC withdraws for a month because they're concerned about BTC being used for money laundering(and with it probably capital flight which they are quite serious about) this is actually probably the biggest 'happening' in the history of Bitcoin in terms of government intervention in a major market.
The last thing you need is an authoritarian government who likes to control its economy concerned about Bitcoin. Especially when the fact majority of large scale Bitcoin mining complexes are within their borders.
I wouldn't try to downplay anything related to actual action by the Chinese government vs useless paper recommendations and warnings. This is pretty serious. They think they're going to be able to implement something to control Bitcoin in a month? And when they realize they can't, what's the next step?
@_date: 2016-03-07 20:17:40
I would love for that to be possible, but if the way to put them out of business is to depress the BTC price long enough for them to close up shop, then I don't think anything like that can realistically happen for obvious reasons.
Putting miners out of business by changing the PoW algo though would probably be quite effective. But this second option is like the yang to the first option's ying. The first option is like staving yourself to kill a parasite, and this option is more like a nuclear bomb. Problem with this one is some good guys will probably go down as well with the bad guys.

I wonder who's going to be the first person involved with Classic to break rank and try to salvage some of their credibility going forward.
I think for many of the people following Classic to 'snap out' of it and realize the lack of substance behind it all it's going to take of their own to step up and condemn the dirty politics, conspiracy propaganda, misleading information ect. 
On the other hand, from an admittedly selfish viewpoint, having exist and acting as the sub that manages to attract many of the more undesirable people in the Bitcoin community really makes this sub a lot better. Signal to noise is much better these days.

Absolutely not. Surprised there are people who still think that so many would go along just because 75% of miners did. There are many, many people who would insta-sell any BTC on that chain and certainly not update their node.
The myth of everyone being 'economically forced' to go to the 75% chain only applies to SHA256 miners. The economic majority, the thing that matters, can easily still abandon that chain and stick with Core. Perhaps with a new PoW algo.

I was writing a similar post about my impressions of that event once the dust settled. Will probably pass on it now.  But the main point that you seem to cover as well was going to be that the software is the weakest link for user experience rather than the protocol itself. Every single complaint post I've read about bad user experiences were failures of wallet software in estimating appropriate fees and presenting that information to the user.
Also your second point is quite good I think and I wouldn't have covered that.
@_date: 2016-03-08 13:35:01


Only because people were using software that failed to provide a proper user experience. That's not the network's fault at all.
@_date: 2016-03-10 08:23:11
Yes, that's a possibility too. But even if we assume it was an attack from say an altcoiner, the Classic people really didn't lose a step in playing completely into their plan. Those threads on were just full of Classic supporters and users. Not only that but those ridiculous media articles were even referencing posts from Classic supporters that were either intentionally, or very ignorantly trying to blow the issue out of proportion and make Bitcoin look bad.
I'll put it this way, if the attack was done by some altcoiner or other outside looking to damage Bitcoin, I think they got way more of an effect than they ever could of dreamed thanks to certain groups of Bitcoiners going Chicken Little. But if it wasn't an outsider, and it was an attack by someone sympathetic to, or behind Classic, with the intention of creating more consensus for Bitcoin Classic and block size increases in general, I think we're seeing now that it failed miserably and is having the opposite effect. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 08:05:57
It's not really the same thing imo. Because Classic isn't a conspiracy theory. I don't think anyone denies that it's a political effort to push Core aside from developing the reference implementation and replace the team. In terms of manipulation, all you really have to do is evaluate the statements by people like Gavin, Brian, and Olivier and it's clear that their chosen rhetoric is not simply accidental.
I do think that it's quite possible that a lot of the conspiracies and falsehoods that are rampant in the Classic community have arisen 'organically', as in someone makes something up and then everyone just goes along with it and it spreads throughout the community with very few questioning whether or not it's true. The biggest problem I have with that is the lack of people behind Classic, or at least other respected members of that community calling the bullshit out when they see it. Instead it seems the status quo is just to let anything that riles people up just go on unquestioned. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 13:26:32
Still. If this person supports Classic they should put Gavin and Brian on the bench and have him step up and act as some interim leadership figure. I remember reading his series of articles before about mining and hard forks and such, and very much disagreeing with how he saw Bitcoin functioning from a top down view. But Stephen Pair in general seems to be miles ahead of both Gavin and Brian in his objectivity and intellectual honesty. It would be an improvement I think.

While Bitcoin is bad for spontaneous discretionary micropayments that would require a single transaction, something like what Changetip does here, but on chain. An ad network alternative could use some implementation of payment channels which would work quite well for microtransactions of these types.
We have all kinds of neat tricks on the horizon for making money flow. Regular transactions never had potential as something that would be particularly good for microtransactions. Even Satoshi said something to that effect back in 2010. Which really tells you something.

You don't think that from from 2011-2014 there wasn't a 'pump Bitcoin, anyone who disagrees is a shill or a troll from Buttcoin' type of culture on reddit and bitcointalk?

The transaction fees in Electrum for example were locked at 0.0002 back in 2013 and 2014. So 10 cent fees aren't really new for anyone using wallets that set their default fee to 0.0002 like Electrum did. And it was probably not the only one.

These guys have been around forever in the Bitcoin community providing their expert opinions and research on various issues. All of their contributions and research has been extremely valuable for Bitcoin over the years. Decker and Miller especially have been around like 5 or 6 years now. Not sure how long Gün Sirer and Eyal have been around, but their blog alone has resulted in tons of interesting discussion in the last few years. And they're constantly putting out new research on top of that.

While Blockstream may have many devs who contribute to Core as part of their company, the way the company has been designed doesn't result in an organization that would be effective in controlling the development of Core.
Their contracts, their incentivization, and their social structure indicate no ulterior motives. And there's even evidence of their practices unfolding right now under everyone's nose, with multiple employees disagreeing publicly over major issues such as the summer 2MB patch and such. That type of freedom is apparently exactly what was intended from the start to avoid Blockstream as a company infringing on Core development. And clearly it's also obvious now that their revenue streams are going to be coming from products like Liquid, corporate sidechains, partnerships with companies like PWC and so on. None of those things have any effect on Core development.
I think if more people would take the time to study and learn about the philosophy and design behind Blockstream, instead of jumping to conclusions about their motivations, we would have a lot less problems in the community. Instead people have tried to turn the existence of Blockstream into politically motivated vague and untrue propaganda in order to help them achieve their goals.

Seeing this complete bullshit on there is depressing.
Especially seeing all the "BlockstreamCore" conspiracy retard posts.
Are people now trying to make Bitcoin look bad in the public eye out of spite? Now that Classic has failed and has little support, are the tx spam attacks and reddit posts trying to damage Bitcoin by feeding outsiders bullshit stories what they are doing now because they want to damage the reputation of Bitcoin?
Seeing their political strategy shift to one that's going negative on Bitcoin towards outsiders/mainstream non-Bitcoin users it makes me wonder what the point is, and what their next step is going to be. Classic has failed, and trying to pull down Bitcoin doesn't make a lot of sense unless they're planning on competing with it. So what's the next step here, altcoin? Is this the transition strategy to try to create the new narrative that Bitcoin has failed, here's our new solution?
They know it requires consensus within Bitcoin to change anything. This new political effort isn't the type of thing that's going to help Classic gain any sort of consensus with the people who know what's going on in Bitcoin(the people who matter and make up the economic and technical consensus). So other than pure spite, what's going on?

I didn't say that 2mb would result in that. If 2mb is satisfactory for you then just stick with Core and be patient like everyone else. But it's well known that Mike and Gavin's philosophy is one that's comfortable with scaling Bitcoin to a point where home nodes are out of reach for most people. I don't see how that's scaremongering at all. It's a pretty common opinion actually, and we just had a big thread on here discussing the concept recently: 
The fact that you would consider me mentioning the data center thing as scaremongering makes me think you're not on the same page as many of the people who support on chain scaling.
I don't think I'm jumping the gun at all. From what I can tell Classic doesn't have anywhere near the economic, technical, and miner consensus to hard fork Bitcoin like they wish to. I don't see how time is going to change any of that. Especially when the original argument back in January was that Bitcoin needed to fork *right now* or bad things would happen. But the longer Classic goes unsupported, the closer we get to all of the alternative scaling puzzle pieces and a likely Core hard fork to raise the block size at some point.
I think that there are so many people that would refuse to go with Classic under any circumstances, and that it's so contentious that the chances of it actually happening now are close to nil. What do you think the probabiliy of Classic hard forking before the end of the year is?

It's a security issue and opens up new attack vectors. And if they were filled legitimately or otherwise, there would be serious issues. People need to design around the worst cases with something like Bitcoin. I guess it needs to be repeated since even Gavin admits it was a mistake now(good on him for being honest and doing so as well).


I don't see it as a conflict of interest. Very few people are against LN. It's kind of laughable that people think because Blockstream threw some money at an open source project to support it, one that could very well be the most important factor in scaling Bitcoin, it's somehow a conflict of interest or conspiracy for them to make money.
If LN allows many more transactions per byte on the blockchain, then it's not about it being valid or allowed. It's about it making it efficient and possible to scale beyond the standard limits of Bitcoin's current technology.


I don't think it is personally. But either way, the market will determine what they choose by using whatever fork or implementation of Bitcoin they want to.


It's pretty evident that if people are willing to fork away from Core for something as trivial as 2MB, that they don't believe that Core is willing or capable of following through on their plan.

Google translate is pretty weak for Chinese. I've tried it and there's  a lot of idiomatic language which makes it difficult to understand without asking someone who understands Chinese to clarify.
Like for example if you're reading something where they're talking about a market, people will say things like '500 knives' or something which refers to something like death from a thousand paper cuts, but what it actually means is more like a slow price drop of the market over a period of time.

Don't forget that we can always change the PoW algo if it ever gets too bad. I agree that it's bad now. We'll see how it goes. PoW is always a fight against the tide of centralization due to economies of scale.

Yes, you wouldn't call it Bitcoin unless for whatever reason it eventually surpassed PoW-Bitcoin economically. But even then I guess calling Bitcoin is arguably wrong depending on the state of the original chain. I think calling it something other than Bitcoin is definitely the right choice for a few reasons.
It's a bit of a unique situation it seems. If PoS technology actually does result in a real robust and secure consensus mechanism, anyone holding Bitcoin essentially gets a free ride on the forked chain. As long as they don't immediately sell it in an attempt to make their feelings known in an economic manner, they don't actually have to do anything since their coins will still be their coins. So it's an interesting situation, since unlike these aggressive PoW hard attempts/attacks, this hypothetical fork would attempt to build rather than destroy, since it affects no one's property and carries no downside for the PoW chain. I could be wrong and missing something on a technical level here that makes it worse than I'm imagining though. Almost seems too good to be true.
Plus, Bitcoin likely has the best distribution in cryptocurrency, which is a critical part of that hypothetical working and secure PoS system, so it gives it a massive advantage from the get go. Distribution is definitely one thing that many alts have failed miserably on, with many resulting in what are effectively out right scams due to poor and deceptive distribution.

Yes, like Core would continue to push something that has serious issues...
Either they're trying to jump in to the political game now(which imo is very stupid of them given the fear surrounding Chinese centralization), or they're saying that they believe Core would try to push something that's dangerous as a soft fork and they'll need to try prevent that. It's a pretty stupid statement overall and doesn't help build trust for the group that everyone knows already has too much power(in the short term, in the long term users will win via a PoW change if absolutely necessary).

If they do even a half ass job of making their federated blockchain it will be the most secure blockhcain in the world, and it will probably work great for them.
But it's still permissioned, and as far as I know there's been no mention of cryptocurrency being involved(yet?).
So in terms of competition with Bitcoin, they're not even in the same category. So nothing to worry about on that end so far.
That link you posted is really good though and everyone here should read it. It seems very few people here have any idea whatsoever that the ideas behind what the banks are doing are solid. They think everyone's an idiot who will "come crawling back to Bitcoin after they realize their private blockchains are a joke".
I still don't think we need to really care too much about what their doing in any sense other than it's pretty interesting, and it's the real deal. If they say they're going to issue a global cryptocurrency, then that would probably relegate Bitcoin to some niche, but it could still be successful if its really private, fungible, censorship resistant.

People were buying and selling drugs back on IRC in the 90s, and probably before that on BBSes or something. But the original Silk Road becoming a minor scandal in 2011 brought in a whole new generation of people who very likely had no idea that such things were possible.

Many people were fine with a 2MB fork, but since segwit came along and should effectively provide a similar amount of capacity increase, people though it would be better to do that first. That's a more complicated solution that's being developed very quickly.
stuff is kind of complicated. But I think people are allowed to debate scaling if they want. I don't know what the exact rule is, but there's a difference between wanting to debate a certain technical proposal and promoting a contentious hard fork.
Maybe it would be better if there was no moderation of anything but blatant spam. But I don't really know. I do know that by comparing to I find to have a much higher level of discourse comparatively. So while I was fully against the censorship when it was first implemented, over time I've come to see that it's a pretty tough issue to deal with and there's downsides on both ends that need to be considered.

There's a pretty huge issue with vote brigading though. Regular community members and contributors 'organically' up/downvoting stuff is fine. But when you have people soliciting votes from their friends(who in turn solicit their friends and so on), and in some cases vote manipulation here by bots, it can kill a community very quickly if there's not some at least widespread awareness or action taken to combat those issues. 
My default was and kind of is to be against censorship in general. But I've also come to see what kind of problems that are faced on here. The reality is that reddit is just not that great of a site, and it's not good platform for serious discussion. And that leaves my opinion of what the best policies are kind of in limbo, since I don't think they are any easy answers here.

Taking very few, off handed, casual, out of context comments from 2010 to try to extrapolate that into a technical opinion is a bit silly don't you think? 
To say that he thought we could 'easily' scale on chain is a big stretch. And with no technical debate or deep discussion about it there's no evidence that he gave such a topic much thought at all, Especially considering that from his viewpoint back then the idea must have been so far out into the future as to be almost irrelevant during a time when there was maybe a few hundred people involved and BTC was just only recently worth more than a single penny. It's a complicated topic and Satoshi was a busy person trying to make sure Bitcoin was given a decent chance at becoming what it is today. I can imagine anyone would find it annoying that people were are trying to derive their technical opinion for a few off handed comments from 6 years ago.
@_date: 2016-03-30 18:29:35
Too many people seem to have been mislead into believing Classic has or had any kind of significant consensus.
Also, there are lots of people who apparently refuse to recognize the fact that a successful contentious hard fork effectively renders Bitcoin a failed system in many people's eyes. If Bitcoin is so easily changeable it's just not that interesting and unlikely to be as world changing as people may have once thought.
The correct and arguably ethical thing to do for a group that is so sure that their solutions are superior is just to fork off themselves and let the market speak for itself. Rather than trying to force a  potentially economically devastating situation that bears resemblance to the classic mutually assured destruction scenario that keeps nuclear powers at bay. No reason to attack the mainchain and attempt to force an unwanted change on people. 
Luckily it appears that the odds of Classic succeeding at this point are very slim, so it's more of a philosophical issue now rather than a immediate danger. Hopefully we learn a lot from what's happened so we can avoid repeating history and further damaging Bitcoin.

At best this is neutral news for Bitcoin and I'm not expecting any governments to want to use Bitcoin anytime soon, if ever.

So even when all governments move over to digital currency, the primary use case for censorship resistant money still stands.

There is wide consensus on a 2MB blocksize. But since segwit was announced, as long as wallets update themselves to support the new style of transaction, Core will effectively have an increased blocksize that can reach up towards 2MB. So if segwit never happened we would all probably be waiting now for a Core hard fork to 2MB. But since segwit changes the game, adding 2MB now on top of segwit is a different proposition altogether, since it could effectively result in a max blocksize closer to 4MB.
So people on Core will be getting an effective increase, but Core can't just raise it to 2MB now since the situation is different, and technical consensus for 2MB is not the same as technical consensus for 2MB + segwit. And since segwit is apparently a huge improvement, adding segwit first and waiting 12 months to observe and plan exactly what approaches people will use to increase capacity sounds reasonable to me. 
Taking all of that and dumping Core to go to a client that just changes the cap to 2MB doesn't make sense to me really. Seems like a very extreme measure driven by egos rather than reality.

That was mostly caused by poor fee handling by wallet software, but it also appears that the problems that people are experiencing are similarly caused by poor fee handling by wallet software. Although the cases are two different types of failures by wallets, the root cause and the weakest link again seems to be end user software rather than the protocol.

Donations or not, having one person running 800 nodes really defeats the purpose. That is unless the network was under some sort of strain and it was necessary for the community to take some temporary measure to relieve it. Even then, it's a lesser of two evils situation.
If Bitcoin's node decentralization starts to go the same way mining has then we're really pushing it. Even BTCC who I'm fairly certain had perfectly good intentions caught a lot of shit for spinning up 100 nodes. This is much worse, and I thought the whole point was for Classic to show that all the people who've run nodes over the years, and are basically the backbone of the network, were supposed to switch over to Classic has some kind of demonstration of support. But what we're seeing here seems to be anything but that.

I don't think Bitcoin is remotely politically capable of ever implementing a viable PoS solution should one be proven robust and workable. So if that happens then it's going to have to compete on other merits, because there is zero chance there's ever widespread consensus to fork it. However, I guess this also presents a unique case where a minority fork can survive with  an interesting advantage being that it won't have to rely on PoW to survive, meaning it can fork without any sort of hashrate battle. And since it probably won't die from being attacked due to Bitcoin's   reasonably widespread distribution(other than Satoshi), it's possible that that might motivate some people to hold rather than dump as a way to hedge their bets with both chains. 
I hadn't really thought about it too much, but unless I missed something there it's not as bad as I originally thought. As long as someone forks Bitcoin to PoS, assuming for whatever reason that this became the more economically dominant chain over the PoW one, anyone who didn't sell would be sitting pretty.
This doesn't address the point about Bitcoin being outcompeted. But after writing this I'm actually much less worried about that happening specifically from something like a hypothetical robust PoS system outcompeting it. I've actually always thought that was theoretically possible assuming that it is technologically possible. But if Bitcoin does get outcompeted, it looks as this may make it less likely that PoS itself could do it. And that it will take some sort of other competitive advantage to overcome Bitcoin, maybe.

Well, it's not really a one or the other thing though too. So far the total crypto market cap has grown to include Ethereum in addition to Bitcoin. At least that's how the chart looked to me. I didn't do any sort of quantitative analysis on it, so take that for what it's worth.
@_date: 2016-03-11 18:39:50
Which of course is why while a 51% attack is considered a major risk, it's theoretically an attack which will have a fixed cost and can be recovered from.
Why people are going out of their way to add attack vectors that appear be absolutely devastating is confusing to say the least. The probability of attack would have to be infinitesimal and the benefits from whatever is gained by this new addition would have to be huge. And even then, Bitcoin is already a pretty risky experiment. The idea of adding something like this when you give an honest answer to the 'what are the risks?' question, is already making me cringe.
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:29:27


This is true. The Bitcoin type node by its nature has less control. But if the federated node is designed correctly it shouldn't really have any appricible power over your money. Also, theoretically the federated network could easily be more physically secure than the Bitcoin mining network. But of course that's only in theory and doesn't exist. 


I guess where we differ in opinion is just how much is lost for a Bitcoin type network when nodes require data center level power to participate on the network.
@_date: 2016-03-09 08:34:27
Yeah, I've always believed that the insistence on microtransactions being on chain or decentralized is kind of like using a shotgun to kill a mosquito. Topping up an account with a few bucks worth of BTC once and awhile should be ok. Worst case scenario is that you lose your $5. And anyone who has the disposable income to be loading $5 onto a system like this isn't going to miss their rent because their $5 got goxxed. Not that anyone wants that to happen, and of course people would want to be using what appear to be trustworthy services. But the worse case scenario should barely make anyone blink should it come to pass.
If we can get low overhead microtransactions through Lightning or something, then that will be great too. But I don't mind a bit of centralization if the stakes are pennies.
@_date: 2016-03-12 18:48:11

Actually it is. It's ultra cheap government subsidised power in what appear to be remote locations near hydro plants. We're talking like 1 or 2 cent per kWh. Someone has 2 cent power in very remote northern Canada. So it's not only in China, but China has all the pieces to the puzzle that makes it the most competitive mining location.

He may have never signed anything, but there's lots of blocks from 2009 that show a specific pattern and are believed to be mined by him.

I think it's uncovered a deadly weakness: That a lot of powerful people in the Bitcoin community are susceptible to very basic political maneuvering.

It's kind of sad that Classic people are still executing this political attack even though it's clear that they have failed to get consensus. But now at a whole new level that takes it outside of our own little internal fight and makes Bitcoin look bad infront of the whole world.
Watching them spread the bullshit around and having the media and reddit pick up on it like this is sad. They're actually doing some real damage here to the public perception of Bitcoin. Long term it won't matter, but it's still really annoying and disappointing as hell to see.

I guess that's probably part of the reason people like Lukejr are trying to make nodes one of the central issues in these debates.
I've been pretty apathetic about the whole node diversity and count issue so far, but if it's really that bad then maybe it's a bigger deal than I thought.
For now my primary issue that I want resolved is mining centralization. But if the node count on the network is really just a thinly veiled mirage to give the illusion of decentralization, then that's important too.

They use a version control system called git, and there's a master branch of code where you 'merge' in new code that has been written and decided upon as ready to add.

Over the years I've seen a couple of comments alluding to Satoshi not having actually invented the blockchain data structure, and I wouldn't really be surprised either way. And it's not like he claimed that he did as far as I know. I just don't know enough about the history of the technology to know exactly what came when, and what Satoshi's version of a blockchain was an iteration of exactly. We know that the PoW function was based of Adam Back's Hashcash. But other than references to other e-cash/digital money/cypherpunk stuff that was developed over the years, I don't really have a good grasp on what specifically lead to what in Bitcoin(other than the PoW function as I mentioned.)
So if anyone is more familiar with how these things evolved and how Satoshi ended up with the Bitcoin blockchain, please feel free to enlighten us.

So what has stopped 21 Inc from releasing these devices with their 18nm very efficient chip?
I respect the work they are doing, especially on the software end of things, but I think it's clear that they have some big challenges that they face with regards to integrated consumer device mining.
They've been at it since 2013 and we've seen multiple prototypes or concept machines that obviously didn't pan out. Maybe they're getting geared up now to release some new ones this year though, not sure.
Either way, mining centralization is a far bigger issue than many seem to think imo. It's easy to say 1 billion devices, it's another thing to actually have that happen. If smart people like 21 have had difficulties making that happen, the chance of that being a realistic scenario for 2016 or beyond is probably not so high.

They've made it quite clear that they're not targeting the illegal market sector at all, and that makes sense.

I agree with everything you said except this. Since there's a market for botnet control and/or DDoS as a Service. Which means there is either someone paying for the DDoS attacks, or a botnet operator is performing their own DDoS in lieu of getting the current market rate. So it's an opportunity cost, even if they technically don't have to pay to use their own botnet.

Thanks for the answer. Was curious about that for a while now. There was a recent post in the last month or two here where a major gambling site(Bodog, not targeting US customers at all) was recommending Coinbase as a way for customers to deposit and withdraw BTC. It kind of implied to me that it would be fine for non-Americans, but I guess that's not the case at all and they made a mistake.
@_date: 2016-03-14 19:16:31
Well, there are quite a few Core developers and associates who are comfortable with a 2MB hard fork, and a group of them are even publishing a patch for that in three months or so. Including two of the most targeted developers by Classic supporters, Adam Back and Lukejr. The question is whether or not there is enough consensus for that. But if people want to back that and try to increase the consensus towards Core going to 2MB, then I think that's a good option for people.
I don't know what the right answer is, or really who in Core supports what at this point tbh. But it's there if people are serious about wanting 2MB.
@_date: 2016-01-14 12:01:03


Yes, lest we forget about how this whole thing started.
It's crazy to think about what kind of DoS attacks we could have run into had everyone went along with that. Especially considering now there's concern about the 2MB transaction that takes over 10 minutes to verify that is one of the potential attacks that people have to consider now.
It's so crazy that I feel like they owe everyone an explanation. Especially with how confident they were about 20MB being just fine and dandy. And Gavin doing his so called testing to confirm it as well.

Well another scenario that could happen is Bitcoin would just 'die', that's pretty unspecific, but a wide scale loss of confidence leading to price decline could happen. People are already very nervous about the trend towards Chinese centralization. My first scenario in the other post with people supporting a different PoW chain with Core and everyone else might not happen because people might just think it would eventually end up with the same fate of Chinese dominance. 
The scenario where the Chinese chain continues to exist due to support in China might be pretty probable too. I'm not sure how much the Chinese Bitcoiners and gamblers who use Bitcoin trading as entertainment view decentralization as important. There's a decent chance that they don't really care, and their economic activity is more than enough to sustain this 'China Bitcoin'. If people such as yourself are happy to use the Chinese Bitcoin then that's some added support too.

Botnets are already a non-issue for reasonable sized alts. Even ones that are/were meant to be GPU resistant. They exist, and people mine with them, but they don't dominate any reasonably sized network. And Bitcoin's would be orders of magnitude larger most likely, with software optimizations written to max out specific hardware performance on what would likely be high end GPUs. Even the biggest botnets in the world would be a drop in the ocean in this case. 
The number of slave computers on the botnets can be huge, but between the variety of different hardware and the rarity of high hashrate hardware being a part of any botnet, there's no chance of a single person gaining enough power through botnets alone to pose a threat of &gt;50% attacking Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-14 11:45:37


Yeah, botnets as an issue is massively, massively overstated by many. Even tiny alts(relative to Bitcoin) don't really have major problems with botnets. Sure, some people do mine with botnets, no denying that. But they don't dominate the hashing as you might expect, mainly because the slave computers aren't really optimized for mining, and they also add to the network security.
Botnets would be a complete non-issue with something on the scale of Bitcoin.

I'm going to have to agree. 
I have nothing against the people building Open Bazaar at all, and I support the spirit of their efforts. But based on my reading so far it seems like another Bitcoin solution in search of a problem unfortunately. 
I hope my impression is wrong. But I can't help but notice how many people in Bitcoin are pinning their hopes on Open Bazaar being some sort of game changer without actually realizing that it's not a censorship resistant marketplace, it's a desktop app where you can host your own storefront and sell things. And buyers can use a 2 of 3 escrow to help avoid fraud. 
Nothing about that is inherently bad or anything, it's cool that some legitimate new technology is being built. But it's also a completely new paradigm of commerce, that's separate from the World Wide Web. Think about that for a second. We like to talk about network effect here a lot, Open Bazaar is trying to build something from scratch on a separate network, off web, that as of now has zero users. That's an incredibly tall order. I hope they can do it, everyone wins if they can, but whoever is in charge of user acquisition probably has the most challenging job of their career ahead of them. You can't just direct them to your website, you need them to install your software. And they need to know how to use Bitcoin.

This seems to be a widely held opinion in the Classic community, but personally I highly doubt that. Unless you mean that most of them would continue developing on an alternate chain with the original paramaters(minus a PoW change if necessary), and that Classic would be free to merge their developments. Then sure in that sense they'll probably still be developing.

Regarding the China stuff, I've been told that at least one Chinese pool's hashpower is largely coming from multiple sources within China. I don't have any proof though, and I don't want it to be true either. But either way based on everything I've seen I think it's likely that the majority of the hashing now takes place in within China. But that's just my opinion. I'm not going to claim that as an objective fact until people can post some data from the pools showing their geographical breakdown of workers. It's might not be in their best interest to release such data though too. But like I mentioned before, I was told that at least one pool actually does make that data available to its users. I'm not a miner though. Maybe someone here is and knows what I'm talking about.
Regarding the federated chain:
Well, what I describe could very well potentially be a sidechain. But nothing about the way I imagine it would be closed as you put it. It would be decentralized, but with a different consensus mechanism than Bitcoin.
It could maybe become closed, if it was co-opted by some special interest groups seeking to change it from the open and decentralized network that I imagine it as. But that only happens if people let it happen. Similarly with Bitcoin.
But the main issue is that when you get to the point where running a Bitcoin node requires a data center, you're effectively creating a defacto federated system. In my hypothetical federated blockchain, anyone who would be able to meet the technical requirements should theoretically also be able to join the network and become a validator. There might be some further requirements due to the additional task of validating, and in a small network that had say 3 of 5 block validation, trust would be much more of an issue. But the larger you scale up, the less of an issue it should be as long as there's even a minimal economic incentive attached. 500 of 999 is a lot different than 3 of 5 for example. Being able to do it this way offers tremendous advantages over the additional overhead that trying to use Bitcoin for this type of network would bring. Requiring a Bitcoin node to be a data center really kind of defeats the purpose of permissionless validation. A low-permissioned federated system where someone who has data center capability to participate in the network is allowed to do so based on having that ability makes more sense. Bitcoin makes more sense when the barriers of entry are kept lower, else you bare the cost of being permissionless, while erecting barriers that keep the only real advantage that it's meant to have(decentralization) limited by technology.

If we agree that a decentralized Bitcoin is in Bitcoin's best interest then I don't think it's a stretch to say that he doesn't have Bitcoin's best interests at heart. 
If you disagree on that fundamental point, then that's fine. And I agree that he thinks he's trying to do what he believes will result in the maximum return for himself and his investors. I don't think he's right at all, but I do understand that some people think sacrificing Bitcoin's decentralization for the sake of on chain scaling will result in some kind of adoption incentive because they also believe that it's being 'held back' by the current capacity. So I don't think I'm ignorant on what different people's motivations are. But I'm also not comfortable with the idea of Bitcoin nodes requiring dedicated data centers in the future so it can compete as a payment network with centralized alternatives and such.

I'm sure it will still get raised eventually. But there's no reasonable endgame in relying on raising the max block size to scale Bitcoin. 
My impression of Classic is that they thought that it needed to be raised right away. And that once the binaries were released in February they were hoping there would be quick consensus and then 28 days later the hard fork would happen. I think the disagreement is more about when and who, rather than whether or not the block size will be raised.

Why would it need consensus in the case of PoS? Can't anyone just fork to PoS at any time? It doesn't cost anyone anything, and they're welcome to hold or sell their BTC that exist on the new PoS chain, right? Or am I missing something here? Or do you specifically mean a hard fork to fully end the PoW chain? Is there a way to do that? Wouldn't people who mined before just mine as long as it's profitable to them? 
@_date: 2016-03-06 21:29:04
There are many things that miners can do with the Bitcoin protocol. Some of those things are objectively unproductive, or damaging. In general, miners avoid doing many of the things that they could potentially do because it's in their interest to try to keep the price of BTC as high as they can.
They are allowed to do anything they want. And other people are allowed to perceive their actions any way they please. I don't have a technical solution for this problem, but in the future if I have an economic choice to make that involves Antminer or the people involved in making these decisions at Antminer I think the rational choice would be to seriously consider not enabling such actions by supporting them. After all, that's the only power anyone really has.
To use an extreme example, Ghash.io was caught gambling site by double spending transactions from a gambling site. Now I'm not saying that this is equivalent to what is going on here. It's not, it's worse, but by your logic I should just accept it unless I can solve that specific attack with a technical solution. I don't really see how anyone can want to try participate in what is supposed to be a free market, but eliminate the idea of reputation and consequences from actions. The protocol does not dictate what is productive or beneficial. Notice I'm not trying to make this into a moral issue either. I think that Antminers actions are economically damaging to Bitcoin(this hard to measure exactly, but I don't think anyone can argue that these actions are even neutral rather than negative), and by extension they are economically damaging to me. Thus if given the opportunity to provide an economic disincentive to them and anyone else participating in these types of practices I can't see how it would be rational to do anything but that. The protocol allowing something shouldn't dictate how another economic actor responds.

Even if we had a quote from Satsohi saying something like: "I expect we'll be up to 1TB blocks when things really start to pick up.", it doesn't mean that at the time he necessarily fully understood all the implications of what larger blocks would mean. The idea that using casual off hand statements he made in the context of 2010 should hold any weight in the technical debate of 2016 is a bit silly really. It really just makes no sense to do so and I don't see why so many people insist on trying to extrapolate Satoshi's technical opinion on our modern issue from a few words he wrote on the forum 6 years ago.

They're co-founders of the company. They're not going to quit Blockstream itself.
Classic or this weird miner plan would be a disaster for Bitcoin should either come to pass. Blockstream will continue working on something, but I'm not so sure it would be either of those blockchains. The miner thing is even more outrageous than Classic, the way its been presented at least. Unless Core accepts their request/threat to hard fork to 2MB at some point. In which case things will be business as usual. But if Core refuses, and the Chinese miners really do pull of a hard fork by themselves then in that case especially people would really have to go work on a different chain. Probably one with a different PoW algo. 
Classic is silly and unwise imo, but compared to this miner thing at least it's still Bitcoin. Chinese miners threatening to make their own hard forks as they please is a full realization of centralization in China. If it happens they can just go on with their new blockchain. Anyone analyzing the situation objectively will see how and why a group of miners doing this is about the worst possible scenario for a decentralized currency. Short of the Chinese government doing something similar or worse.

It's more about supporting those in the industry who seem to understand and share the philosophy that Bitcoin's only really useful if it's truly decentralized.
I wouldn't say 'I don't trust Coinbase' in the sense that I think they're going to steal anyone's money or anything. But after reading Brian's articles and thoughts on Bitcoin, I think it's pretty clear that he may not have Bitcoin's best interests at heart.
@_date: 2016-03-07 13:49:52
What you say is true. But I think it's also good to have some sympathy for people considering how vicious the community has been over the years at doing things like promoting misinformation, false dreams and ridiculous scenarios, silencing 'dissenters' and playing the 'FUD!' card at anything they believe might have the slightest possibility of negatively affecting their investment, ect.
There's no one person to blame. But the community has really only recently matured to the point where critical discussion of Bitcoin is openly welcomed, and 'pump' tactics and shilling is now openly disdained by what seems like a good amount of people.
(edit: Although the thought just occured to me that maybe people didn't mature as much as got a dose of reality. Or just the fact I don't read other Bitcoin subs is making me draw a very stupid and naive conclusion here!)(edit2: But I want to say optimistic. I definitely think there has been considerable improvement one way or the other.)
So even though I'm against Classic, I feel that people that are angry for what I consider to be reasonable reasons like getting swept up in a community that was honestly just really shitty are not wrong. People getting angry over false information spread as propaganda and conspiracy theories though I have much less sympathy for, but still some. Although they should really learn to be more resistant to this type of manipulation. The public figures in Bitcoin who these people follow and allow the false narrative to continue are the ones who are really acting poorly though.

I don't see Core's plan as one that's specifically intending to raise fees  or make people pay more in the short term. I think some people are saying that in the short term, if fees rise because of increased transactions, it's not the end of the world. That's because Core is not just saying, 'hey let's raise fees and that's that, deal with it'. That's not the way I see it at all. I see them actually attempting to scale Bitcoin in a reasonable and sustainable way. Which will increase capacity and keep fees down one way or the other. Whether that's through increased capacity from segwit, increased blocksize, Lightning, sidechains, or some of the other areas of research mentioned on their roadmap, it doesn't matter which it is specifically, or what combination of those things result in increased capacity. As long as it happens one way or the other. 
I'm not sure where you get the idea that Blockstream is trying to limit capacity to raise fees for miners. But I don't think that's the case at all. But you're not the only person who has come to a similar conclusion because that seems to be the narrative that's been actively spread among people over the last 8-10 months or so. 
edit: How does your opinion change if your premise that Blockstream(and I presume you also mean Core by that) doesn't hold the plan that you think they do and that they're not actually trying to limit transactions or increase fees? And that they're attempting to scale Bitcoin the best way they see fit. If that were true, would you have a different opinion?

He was high on acid(LSD). Huge difference. 
Also, to be fair he was the brother of one of the leaders of Classic but still involved to a seemingly large degree by acting as some sort of representative in the Core slack, running that consider.it site that apparently was supposed to be some sort of official voting system for Classic, as well as the Toomim Brothers mining pool which supported Classic. So you could probably make a good argument that he could be considered one of the 'leaders' of Classic, but his brother was the one who I believe was the actual Lead Developer for Classic at that point. 
And there are *a lot* more reasons than this why people rejected Classic, but that's probably veering to far off topic for a nice summary as you've done here.
@_date: 2016-03-15 19:12:14
I was thinking someone a little closer to the people behind the project rather than a third party. Seems lots of third parties that were claimed to support Classic have either changed their minds, or were erroneously reported as supporting from the start. Because when Classic was revealed they made some claims of huge miner consensus as well as economic consensus. But it seems it was all a mistake and misunderstanding. Or possibly a deliberate long shot at steamrolling that 28 day hard fork by giving everyone else the impression that everyone was already behind it anyway, so they might feel forced or obligated to go with it. Thankfully the collective WTF from the community shut that down relatively quickly.

Doubted what? The economic formula or the technology?
The economic formula is still yet to be proven. So what if he doubted the economic formula from day one? Why does everyone need to be some kind of dogmatic follower of Satoshi? 
I still have my doubts and skepticism about the economic formula personally. But it will be nice if it works out and the network stays secured with the continued lowering of block subsidy due to sustained or growing demand for BTC. I certainly don't see it as any kind of guarantee though.

I think the point was for the poster just to point out how much Classic has diverged from Core, since back when it was presented as a serious alternative part of people's argument for it was that it was just a 'simple' change of the blocksize variable.

I don't know what the law says about it either. If someone dumps a bunch of actually classified documents somewhere and you go out of your way to download them or even read them, is it illegal? Probably not, I guess? But still I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was, either explicitly or through some loophole.
Thing is that I'm actually not a paranoid person in general. Except when it comes to anything internet related.

People who supported Classic at the start really jumped the gun there didn't they. I think most people saw Garzik's name and immediately assumed that it was a solid project. As soon as people starting talking about it and more information spread, it didn't take long for many to see just how bad of an idea it would be.
Core has a solid plan and a very solid team of people to scale Bitcoin. Rejecting their work and trusting something like Classic to take the reins of Bitcoin is honestly just an incredibly bad idea. Too many people putting their emotions before their rationality. People eating up the manufactured crisis, and believing in the character assassinations of Core developers and associates. Even the name 'Bitcoin Classic' should have been ringing alarm bells in anyone's head.

I think using the term 'permissioned blockchain' automatically implies no PoW, as it would make no sense at all for a permissioned blockchain to do that from what I can tell.

If there was significant consensus for it, it would be different. But if somehow things went a bit differently back in January and February and Classic somehow managed to get 75% of miners on board and 28 days later execute the fork, despite massive technical opposition, many major holders, and a large amount of regular users, it would mean the system is too easy to change.
After something like that happening many people would consider Bitcoin a failure most likely. That is unless people keep what they would consider the old chain alive and it becomes the economically superior chain in a reasonable period of time. Even if that happens, some people will still quit because the nothing could ever change the fact that a highly contentious hard fork happened, when theoretically many people believed Bitcoin to be strongly resistant to that.

They are creating customized sidechain products like Liquid, as well as having a partnership with PriceWaterhouseCooper. This whole 'blockchain technology' thing is way more lucrative than anything in Bitcoin land(at the moment at least).
Doing all this business to business stuff is almost certainly why they got their large second round of funding. They basically have the objective claim of being the company with the top experts in the world in this field. Even just something basic like consulting could net them massive hourly rates from banks exploring blockchain tech and stuff. 
Out of all the Bitcoin related companies that I know of, I actually think they have the easiest path to monetization. Their personal compensation is apparently a good amount of time locked BTC too, so they also have incentive to make Bitcoin as good as it can be to maximize their personal gains. But as a company I think they'll be making money regardless of how things go with Bitcoin. Which is actually pretty great since it means a very solid source of funding for top devs who work on Bitcoin.

It's absolutely ridiculous. The fact that the leaders of that part of the community haven't spoken out against such a pervasive falsehood really reflects poorly on them imo. So many people apparently base their entire Bitcoin-worldview on the belief that these conspiracy theories are true, and it's sad to see. People love to latch on to exciting conspiracy theories that paint them as the victim or target of some insidious plan that's holding them back from achieving their goals. The end result is just a complete lack of rational discussion for a decent size minority of the community.
I would really love to see Gavin or someone step up and acknowledge that the conspiracy culture that dominates that section of the community is just doing more harm than good, and stalls progress. (edit: Actually I just learned that he did do a call out of these things on the Let's Talk Bitcoin show. That's good, but I still think something in writing like a serious blog post to address the issue would be better.)
Those threads from earlier this month should have been a huge wake up call. They were absolutely ridiculous and filled with bullshit like "Blockstream has taken over because they dream of becoming the next Paypal.". How do the less crazy people in that part of the community manage to stop from pulling their hair out at all the ridiculousness that gets thrown around day after day?
They need a hard reset of their narrative asap.

I find it common that these things are often much more complicated than they appear on the surface in cryptoland. Which all the more reason I find it insane that there seems to be a significant portion of the community that wants to alienate a large group of people who really understand the system.
Rarely are any changes to such a complex system trivial or without trade offs.

I doubt there would any going back to Core after something like Classic happening. Sure, a few people could fork the Core repo and take it over. But I highly doubt after an event such as a Classic hard fork very many people will be interested in continuing to develop Core. That or some of them will be continuing on what they view as the better chain, the non-Classic one(probably with a different PoW for security reasons). Hard forking to Classic is a full commitment to Toomim taking over the lead maintainer role of the whole Bitcoin project. Simply switching back to Core if people don't like what they bought into just won't be an option.
I just fundamentally disagree with you perception of people involved with Core and what their intentions are and whether or not they intentionally mislead people. The community can complain and demand as much as they want, but there's real constraints and real trade offs that need to be considered. 
Theymos censoring his own sub and message board has absolutely nothing to do with Core. Personally I don't agree with it, and I see that his actions have resulted in many people supporting something like Classic as some sort of misguided protest against it. The only thing people can really say is that Core didn't condemn the censorship, but as gmaxwell pointed out in another thread Core isn't some single entity that can just voice an opinion like that.
I saw that random person post the out of context chat snippet too and thought it was a bad post with bad intentions. But even so, the whole idea of democratic governance in Bitcoin(especially done through something like consider.it) isn't a very good idea for a highly technical project like Bitcoin.
On hard forks vs soft forks, I don't really know. Maybe the dangers are overblown a bit, maybe not. We've had multiple soft forks, and the most recent one resulted in some miners losing a block or two due to a big Chinese miner SPV mining. I don't remember the exact circumstances, but I remember some people lost some money by being on the wrong side of a fork, and Gavin personally refunded them their lost money out of his own pocket. Whether or not everyone would execute a hard fork properly in this day and age, I don't know, but it's certainly not impossible that there is a danger of people losing money from being on the wrong side. I don't have a strong opinion on this subject either way.
I don't buy in to any of the Blockstream conspiracy theories at all. They donated money to an open source software project, not some private solution for scaling.
A hard fork to Classic would alienate(or drive away) a world class dev team with multiple PhDs and professionals with lots of experience. They've already proven their ability and produced some impressive improvements. From what I can tell people support Classic based on a fundamental mistrust of Core. I trust Core and I think their plan to scale Bitcoin is far superior to handing over the project and the faith of it's current 6 billion dollar market cap to something Gavin literally called "a startup" to me today.

I read that when he found out they were irritated at that he changed it back to being signed as the president of Blockstream. The original document as you say was just a draft anyway that wasn't meant for release to begin with. But either way in that thread on Bitcointalk where this all came up it was said that he changed it back.

So is that the protocol's fault, or is that poor user experience a result of their wallet software?
@_date: 2016-03-10 08:29:43
I think at the time that statement sounded reasonable.
However, it's reasonable because no one at the time could really reasonably believe the following two things about the two biggest countries in Bitcoin:
1) That the American internet infrastructure would be completely strangled by monopolistic corporate interests to an extent where the US internet is vastly behind the rest of the modern world.
2) That it would seem that both the majority hashrate, and a super majority of mining pools who relay most of the blocks on the network are actually in authoritarian, communist China behind an abomination like The Great Firewall of China. That adds an additional layer of complexity to the bandwidth issues.
Although I will stay that I think storage is in decent shape from what I can tell. Although my opinion is just one of a casual observer, not someone directly involved in Bitcoin development.
@_date: 2016-01-21 12:33:21
There's a decent amount of early adopters who don't even particularly like Core at all, but would insta-dump what would probably end up being a six figure amount of BTC the moment it hard forks away to something like XT or Classic.
Of course that works both ways and it's possible there are some mega whales that support XT/Classic. If anyone knows some feel free to post, I'm curious. edit: Looking myself I found Roger Ver and Oliver Janssens behind Classic. Wonder if they would dump on the other chain or not. Or if they'd rather hedge their bets and hold on both.

Honestly, it's very unlikely that Bitcoin will work out cheaper in this situation since I imagine people buying and selling BTC in Nigeria are taking a high spread. However, it's good that you're looking into these types of options, and hopefully in the future when BTC is more liquid on a worldwide scale it will make sense.

From where I'm sitting the most intelligent people in the community tend to be behind Core.
If I have to choose one group to defer to, I think it's blatantly obvious that Core and their roadmap has the most thought put into it, as well as backing by a very large amount of notable players in the technical community.
It seems the only way people seem to be able to look past the obvious fact that Core has the most talent behind it is to continue spreading the whole Blockstream conspiracy narrative.
What if it's *not* true? And Blockstream isn't trying to influence Core development in a way that creates a situation where they can exploit the congestion of Bitcoin for profit? Believing this seems to be the basis of many peoples Bitcoin worldview now. The idea that it might not be true doesn't even seem to register.

Yeah. That's kind of the one big economic question/assumption mark about Bitcoin's long term sustainability. As long as demand continues Bitcoin should at least retain its value. But eventually, slowly fees will have to take over as the primary method of incentive for miners to secure the network.
In theory it could work fine if the variables work out. But no one can say for sure until it happens.

So was the issue with the Bitcoin protocol, or the end user software?
@_date: 2016-03-13 20:58:08


It's novel when the quorum is cryptographic money and the consensus is one that is decentralized.
Bitcoin maximalists should be all for a robust PoS system to emerge, since it would appear a hard fork to that for Bitcoin holders has no direct cost to the PoW chain. So it can exist and flourish on its own if it works out that way and everyone who held Bitcoin wins. And if it doesn't work, then Bitcoin hasn't gone anywhere at all. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 18:42:52

Yes, I'm not really trying to make any claim either way with regards to Jeff's development. He's been in the mix and active in the space. And of course github commits never tell the whole story at all. Gavin specifically stated that he purposely stepped back from active development to try to work on the bigger picture issues. And his results from that speak for themselves. So I'm definitely not trying to group Jeff and Gavin in the same boat here. Jeff didn't really go anywhere.
I'm mainly puzzled as to why Jeff decided to go this way. I don't know what his reasons are, but like I mentioned above I really hope that BIP100 isn't a factor.

As someone who's known him a long time I honestly hope you're able to let him know how far he's gone off the deep end. Maybe he'll actually listen. Maybe not, but he's obviously not going to listen to anyone he perceives as part of some crazy theymos and blockstream conspiracy theory.
He's caused and is causing some real damage to Bitcoin and it needs to stop. Bitcoin is already a big deal, and the history books are not going to reflect kindly on people like him and Jihan. So if he can even get a glimpse of reality from someone he knows, he might decide that being the villain who has no problems with turning Bitcoin into the next Paypal isn't actually what he wants his legacy to be.

Some of us realize the issues that Bitcoin faces with decentralization, and trying to help promote a future where Bitcoin can at the very least not become more centralized. There are quite a few people who don't seem to be very concerned with keeping nodes decentralized and such, but luckily they seem to be a minority. 
I promise you that there are lots of people who will not stand for a centralized Bitcoin. Some people might go off and make that themselves after being disappointed that their get rich quick scheme isn't working out in the short term. But whether you believe it or not people really do value decentralization here in this community, and to make it a priority to attempt to solve issues that continue to push the trend towards centralization.

The entire purpose of Classic was a political move for a group of people who want to remove Core from their position as maintainers of the reference software trying to find the least contentious thing they could in order to attempt to do that.
At this point I could probably write a book about why I'm against Classic to be honest. I've written a lot of posts about my various issues with Classic, the way it's been presented and marketed, the actions of the people involved, the supporters, ect.

I wouldn't call it a conspiracy. It's just Bitcoin Classic.
Some might call it a conspiracy, but without getting into a debate on semantics, I don't consider it a conspiracy because I don't think their intentions have ever really been secretive or anything like that.
It's certainly an organized effort though. With considerable resources and support from major players like Coinbase and Roger Ver. And their main weapon is their political strategy, framing false narratives, and propaganda.
The thing is at this point it's far beyond being something that has any chance of happening. And all of this continued political attack is just seemingly out of spite to damage Bitcoin's reputation outside of the community(see: recent tx spam attack leading to chicken little media articles and reddit posts outside of our own Bitcoin subs framing Bitcoin as a failure and supporting that by laughable things like the whole Blockstream conspiracy theory stuff that anyone with a clue knows is complete bullshit.).

@_date: 2016-03-08 13:15:28
The thing is nothing went out at all either. I've yet to hear any report of anything other than poor user experience solely because of the wallet software someone was using. Rather than any sort of issue with the actual function of the Bitcoin network. So it's probably even a lot more minor of an issue, if even an issue at all, than you put it. Anyone with a decent wallet would have had no issues making transactions and paying a fee according to how quickly they required their tx to be confirmed.

It's something that can only be measured in hindsight I believe. And even then, not really 'measured' in the scientific sense. But that's why doing something like Classic is so damn dangerous without clear technical and economic consensus. You look back on the destruction of value after the fact and say, yup, I think there was some serious misjudgement there.
Hard forks that completely change Bitcoin should not be easy to do. Do people still claim that Classic isn't a contentious hard fork attempt? I mean, clearly there's many against it. Why are people still trying to make it happen, as well as trying to damage the public image of Bitcoin as evidenced through those threads on @_date: 2016-03-05 21:30:59


Eh, I definitely feel where you're coming from with this statement and can agree with that sort of general vibe here, but I don't really think we missed much there. Having a bunch of companies use Bitcoin as a distributed database service doesn't really have too much potential imo.
I agree with you that there's not really any consumer incentive though. Not sure there will be until way down the line though if/when Bitcoin becomes a common store of value and people might gain utility by having the ability to spend it sometimes.

It seems to me(based on reading the debate thus far) that a Bitcoin that's at least as decentralized as it is today can't really be anything other than a settlement system. And it needs to be more decentralized than it is today, period. In this state Bitcoin is arguably a failed project from a decentralization perspective. But thankfully there's a fair amount of people who realize that the current situation is dire and want to do something about it.
I mean even if blocks were unlimited right now, 10 minute average blocks that too often seem to take 30 minutes to an hour(confirmation bias of course, not that it matters) doesn't result in a very good payment system anyway. So what's the big deal? People will build some awesome payment systems on top of Bitcoin. Bitcoin will hopefully stop the trend towards centralization and life will go on.

@_date: 2016-01-20 18:16:18
It's quite possible that there's enough economic firepower behind Core that could drive the price of Classic down and make the Core fork viable again. There's at least one group who probably controls a low six figure amount of BTC who will definitely be dumping should a Classic hard fork occur. And they're just a few people in an IRC channel. Who knows how much BTC will be unloaded. 
Of course the same could be said for the Core chain. The market action on both sides would probably be pretty significant. It would be pretty existing to see actually.
I think there's zero chance that the main Core developers work on Classic. Some of the people who contribute to Core may do so. But a lot of people won't be interested.

My bank balance might end up as a number on their blockchain, but that's all in the backend and I don't get any of the advantages I would with Bitcoin. 
I know you're not saying that it's the same as Bitcoin, just that their blockchain will contain real value as the ledger may replace the systems they use today to track value. I agree, and I also agree that it's very likely to be a big deal for banks. I'm not sure any of the benefits will be passed on to consumers/regular people. Maybe, but I'm not holding my breath and I'm glad Bitcoin is available to give me options.

Doesn't make someone a communist to be careful and concerned about what would happen to Bitcoin if it was run by something like Coinbase who clearly would prioritize growth over decentralization.

Classic is just an absolute mess in general. I really don't know what Jeff is thinking. Was really surprised when I first saw his name associated with it.
Classic just seems like it wanted to be the first thing out once XT passed its expiry date or whatever. Like someone just pulled the idea out of their ass, tried to figure out what would be the most likely way to fork away from Core and gain political power, without actually putting enough thought in to what one would normally expect for a project that's intended to take the reins on a 6 billion dollar economy.

@_date: 2016-01-25 20:44:09


Which makes it even more of a head scratcher. Because I've been reading Classic proponents sell one of the main benefits of Classic being that 2MB blocksize + the segwit multiplier to bring it up closer to 4MB. But if segwit is barely on the Classic devs radar, and there's additional work that will be needed to implement it, then it could be a while before Classic gets segwit.
So then it's looking likely that for the immediate future the actual throughput difference between Core and a 2MB-no segwit Classic is going to be rather small. Assuming the popular wallets update to support segwit.

Honestly, it's an interesting conundrum. On one hand your position makes sense, and it doesn't sound too far fetched that law enforcement might not be on board with this. On the other hand, it's possible that Bitcoin gets out competed by another product with better privacy. 
The middle ground might be to make sure Bitcoin has the best privacy tech ready to go on a sidechain.

Meh, the more they try to play politics like this the worse they make themselves look. If anything it just keeps demonstrating to people what their game is.

I think you missed the point. That's because they're not accepting RBF transactions. 
If they were accepting RBF with no confirms we would start to see complaints about being double spent most likely. Maybe not for a coffee, but it will happen.
I'm not necessarily against opt-in RBF or anything. Just wanted to point that out since OP there put in a good effort to make that post.

I know that Bitcoin's algos that are not quantum resistant can be changed. But I wonder if this brute forcing of private keys can be significantly improved by using some of the newest quantum computing tech that's being developed now.
Or maybe quantum computing doesn't add anything over current methods. I don't know, but I'm curious.
@_date: 2016-03-20 16:59:53
Fork the blockchain and use a checkpoint for a while or some other solution where it ignores the longest chain, or start a new blockchain from scratch. That is if they're so sure that Classic and the philosophy behind it is superior.
I assume they would want to do like Mike suggested along time ago and just use the checkpoint idea. Just because they probably already have BTC, and I think they're attached to the idea of Bitcoin and will want to eventually surpass it economically as a 'told you so' type of thing.

Bitcoin is very unlikely to ever be able to compete with credit cards overall as a payment method. Credit cards simply have too many advantages for consumers who use them properly.
That being said, 8 minutes and 0.0008 BTC is like pretty good for sending someone $10k. So there's still a lot of utility. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 14:56:27
Yeah definitely. People in Macau were buying $100k pieces of jewelry with it and then 'returning' the item for cash in hand on the spot. Seller is totally in on it and takes a percentage.
Lots of different ways to work around the $50k USD per year limit that's supposed to be enforced.
Bitcoin is unlikely to be any sort of leader in capital flight, but even getting a small chunk of that market could be big.

If it was a one off joke thrown in there, then yeah. But it's a pattern, and just adds more toxicity to the whole debate/discussion.
I don't think you can say that SW is going to be integrated for the sole purpose of enabling LN to function. Especially as it results in an effective increase in transaction throughput, and that's what people are asking for. The fact that it fixes malleability is a bonus, and something that people have been asking for long before LN was even an idea.

Not sure how it would work out, but it does sound dangerous to stay with SHA256 if you have a small minority of hash power.
People haven't even really been able to make SHA256 alts now for a while because their pretty easy to attack. Presumably the fork that Core is on would be a lot harder to attack than some random alt, but still. Hard to really gain confidence.
Sounds like either way would be a bit sketchy. If it happens it will be a tough position to be in I think. If there isn't strong consensus it could even end up in another fork situation with some people staying on SHA256 and some going to the new chain. That would be pretty bad.

Really though. How is it that someone like that can continue to put their reputation on the line by backing such plans and still continue to be listened to?
You would think that Bitcoin, with no authority and no leaders, would be the one place that reputations would be very highly valued and sensitive to being affected by massive failures and miscalculations(especially those who are engineers). But reputation here seems to matter much less then one would expect.

I don't know about Jeff Garzik, as he doesn't appear to have any public issues with anyone and has always at least publicly seemed fairly neutral. But Gavin and people on the Core team have not been getting along at all a for long while now.

Well, they're not the first person to think that it would be nice to discover some new idea that adds additional incentives for people to run nodes. It's just I don't think anyone has ever really figured out a good way to do that, even after all these years. So it will probably just stay as it is now, with people supporting the network or companies running their own nodes for verification purposes.

@_date: 2016-03-20 15:33:21
Then fork Bitcoin and go make your own version of Bitcoin where if successful you scale it up all on chain to the point where nodes will need to be hosted in data centers. Clearly enough people vehemently disagree with putting on chain scaling head of decentralization that Classic isn't going to succeed. Maybe you'll need to change the PoW, maybe not if you get a decent amount of hash and don't think that miners on Bitcoin will go as far as stopping their own mining to attack your chain. 
Out of context Satoshi comments from 6 years ago are irrelevant in a modern technical debate. If you want to say that you and others feel deceived, and that you expected the project to be able to scale on chain easily, I don't argue with that view. I agree that the Bitcoin community has been very deceptive since it first started getting popular back in 2011. If it were more open and criticism wasn't drowned out or mocked maybe people wouldn't be so angry because they bought all the pump talk.  
Either way I think there's a high probability that we're going to see a block size increase at some point anyway. Unless things have changed and it's not going to be needed that is. But as far as I know we'll be doing a hard fork that will probably have a few different things thrown in, including a block size increase.


I guess the difference between us is I don't see any reason at all to distrust people involved with Core.


I don't really care too much what Theymos does to be honest. At this point I see the whole situation is a big can of worms with no easy answers since it's pretty much out of control. Reddit is just not a good platform for this type of interaction.

Segregated Witness also seems to be a huge innovation by all accounts as well.
Confidential Transactions looks promising too.
Before recently I didn't think there was much of a chance of Bitcoin getting much more innovation. And to be honest I talked a lot of shit about how I didn't think it was likely that Bitcoin could compete in the long run against better technologies. But in the last year or so the code and ideas that are coming have been phenomenal. It's too bad so many people are too far up their own ass with conspiracy theories and such to take an objective look at what's going on. And who's responsible.

Does anyone have any data on whether the total crypto market cap is expanding, or is there a correlation between BTC's market cap dropping and ETH's raising? I don't follow too much but I've noticed each of them often trading inversely for a while and I'm probably biased to checking only during big movements(and even then, sporadically), can't draw any strong conclusions from just that.
Even if there is a correlation, the same type of stuff was happening with LTC for a long time. Traders have always loved uncertainty in Bitcoin and used that to exploit the volatility. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 07:45:45


I think it would be more likely people using Bitcoin would say that before any government would. But I hope you're right. It's not about the direct damage an attack can do, it's the collateral damage and loss of trust.
The only time we hold an inherent advantage against the government is now while we have an exahash of ASICs and they don't. As soon as we fork to a new PoW it's a fight on equal terms that we can't win.

People here probably just assume that everyone follows this stuff as much as they do. But in reality lots of people have no interest in wading through all the crap on here.

Yes, from what I've understood that is the most important point of debate. However it's not receiving nearly enough spotlight for some reason.
I don't know if your comment's tone was meant to make the statement in a dismissive manner or not, but it seems many people have downplayed how big of a deal the relationship between the future de/centralization of Bitcoin and the Great Firewall is. 
If bigger blocks will promote further centralization of mining in China due to the GF, then alarm bells should be ringing, as I believe centralization in China is Bitcoin's biggest existential threat. 
Some people seem to believe that bigger blocks will do the opposite, and re-decentralize mining outside of China. If that's the case, people need to be making that argument loud and clear, with the appropriate amount of technical rigor as well.
@_date: 2016-01-02 13:07:11
I had the same initial thought when I orginially made the post.
If BTC tx fees go up a lot this year things are going to be a bit weird since a lot of people do like to use BTC to buy things online for a few bucks.

Gavin and Mike envisioned a future where nodes were only run in data centers and apparently people who support Classic are fine with going down that path. Even though it would be trivial for governments to shut down those mega nodes if they wished to do so.

Not true for me at least. Although when Classic came along obviously it captured a lot of my attention. But I never had any intention of posting as much as I had and I'm not particularly happy about the amount of time I've spent doing so to be honest. But it's an important issue for sure.
This was an alternate account set up for reasons entirely unrelated to Bitcoin(other than just standard privacy) that I happened to be using all the time when Classic came out. It's not like I only post in this sub. I doubt I posted in this sub too much before Classic came out anyway. Could have still been my  sub before Classic just because I always check it though, not sure. But it would be obvious to anyone from some other subs I frequent exactly what this account was made for posting about, and it definitely was not Bitcoin.

The website seems pretty good and is a solid start. I don't know if PR is exactly what's needed for and open source software project. by PR I'm mostly referring to professional PR/marketing/reputation management. That kind of stuff seems a bit dirty and too political for this type of open project. But I do agree that there is still something lacking. Some people that could help foster improved communication with the public(not in a marketing type way, but more honest/non-manipulative) would go a long way I think. 
I think taking an open communication approach that demonstrates honesty in the best kind of 'marketing' anyway, in the long run at least. Plus, building people's trust in the people developing the protocol behind their money is important. It's difficult to know what's going on unless you hang out in IRC and/or have personal relationships with some of the developers. I think things are getting better and as long as the effort continues and the developers are open to working with people who can assist them and take some of the communication load off their back things will work out. Ideally it would give them more free time as well. Anyone can see how much time has been wasted in the past year or so. Add up that hourly rate that's been wasted, on top of the emotional distress and it'll make you cringe.

It's supposed to be free software where anyone can run their own network I believe. So there can and probably should be multiple networks(I think?). But I have seen some of the standard venom/conspiracy stuff of late directed at that project/Matt mostly based on something about centralization or whatever. I didn't really understand any of the arguments they were making, but to be honest given the tone I didn't really bother putting much effort into doing so.
So that might have contributed to him not wanting to maintain that. I'm not sure though. Could also be unrelated and just be a lot of extra effort to maintain, and he just doesn't have the time or something. Or some combination of factors.

I agree with you there about the difference between incentives and conspiracies.
In this case I specifically disagreed with the notion that Mike's post was a result of direct action by R3. The thread on it here was filled with people who thought it was, and I thought it was very unlikely. 
Not that Mike's post here eliminates the possibility of this all being a plan executed by R3 in an attempt to harm Bitcoin, but I still highly doubt the notion. And also agree with the quote from the R3 person in Mike's post here that R3 and Bitcoin aren't in competition, and R3's success if anything would help Bitcoin gain credibility as an alternative system.

That's not how it would work. If the longest fork of Bitcoin is a centralized Chinese one then it's irrelevant really. 
Plus there's lots of ways they can become profitable if they needed to. They have a lot of people who could charge huge hourly rates to banks and all these other organizations interested in blockchain technology. Their names alone pretty much guarantee them enough consulting work to last probably indefinitely.

You were mislead. It's not the first time it's happened in Bitcoin's history, and unfortunately it's unlikely to be the last.
People were also told Bitcoin was anonymous once upon a time.
People who questioned Bitcoin's ability to scale were dismissed as trolls and told it was as simple as changing a max blocksize variable in the code(while technically true, is extremely naive or intentionally misleading).
Bitcoin's community has never been good at being objective. For many people reality is less important than the price of their Bitcoin.  The good news is that I think it's gotten a lot better over the years, and I hope it continues.

Context was in contribution to Bitcoin Core in the last 2 years or so.
Apparently the results of his research were pretty poor, or we wouldn't be having this conversation right now. Otherwise his ideas would have been merged into Core. And since they haven't been he's gone on a personal crusade to position himself in a way that gives him more power to add his ideas to Bitcoin without having to go through the same level of rigor and peer review that he would with Core. Big assumption? Yeah it is, but looking at the caliber of people behind Core and the ones announced so far for Classic, it's pretty self-evident behind which implementation the technical expertise aligns itself:

Transitioning to segwit for now which will add capacity if wallets integrate the new type of transaction, and observing and working on projects like LN and sidechains for the next 12 months or so sounds reasonable to me.
12 months from now we'll have a clear picture of exactly where we are and lots of data that should clearly indicate either way whether or not increasing the blocksize will be necesssary. And it probably will be, it's not like people involved with Core are against raising the the blocksize, quite the opposite really. It's just something to be approached with caution given the current push towards centralization in China. 
You especially have the most at stake here, and I'm sure you'd do anything you could to avoid putting Bitcoin in a position that could allow the communist, authoritarian Chinese government to access enough hash power that they're in a position to attack Bitcoin. At least with Core you know that decentralization is going to be their biggest concern, and rightfully so since it's what makes Bitcoin what it is.

Depends on the spread where you're cashing out the BTC. If you can cash out somewhere like the US where it's pretty liquid then it's not bad. But say you want the money in Macau or something, you might get demolished by the spread paying multiple percent using some method like Localbitcoins or something similar.
In that case there can be a huge hidden cost. And outside of the US and parts of Europe, and I guess inside of China(although irrelevant for this topic since we're talking about moving money out), Bitcoin is pretty illiquid and spreads are high. Which really limits the use cases as a way to send money internationally.

Great comment.
If Bitcoin as a whole doesn't become more resistant to these sorts of political attacks, there isn't much hope for the future. Maybe we survive this one, as people are probably starting to come to their senses now with this whole Classic debacle(I hope). But now that it's been shown how easily so many businesses, miners, and users can be manipulated it's probably not going to be the last time.

Cold wallet should be able to open every port wide open, set every config file to allow connections from anyone, anytime.
And it shouldn't matter since it should *never be connected to the internet*. Anything else is just a wallet, not a *cold wallet*.

More accurate would be to say that despite previous hacks it hasn't failed, which demonstrates a robust system.

Honestly, the fact that the Bitcoin market/community is apparently even receptive at all to the idea that Classic could take over from Core makes me think that this whole thing is worth a lot less than I thought it was. Not in terms of price per coin, but in the most basic sense of it being a viable idea/project long term. It sounds like the project is going to be perpetually threatened by anyone who can come in and play the political game. You would think that the businesses, miners, and even users of Bitcoin would be savvy enough to see through bullshit, but that clearly does not seem to be the case at all.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:23:19


Back then 70% of total mining including pools, and probably close to 50% actual hardware didn't reside in China behind the Great Firewall.
The question is whether raising the blocksize will continue that trend. If it does, then Bitcoin will lose it's most valuable feature(if it hasn't arguably already).
So anything said by Satoshi or whomever really doesn't apply to 2016. Satoshi didn't even predict pooled mining, Slush invented it in 2010. So as cool as Satoshi is, it's kind of irrelevant now.
But really the times people were mislead was every time the topic came up from 2012-2014 and was dismissed as trivial when it clearly is not.

Yes, exactly that document. I'm looking for technical experts('rocket scientists' in context with this thread) who *didn't* sign that.

I heard that it was designed to be resistant to those types of attacks but I don't have any proof either. So I'm not really sure as I haven't bothered to really look into it since I've mostly been distracted by all that's been going on in Bitcoin for the last long while now, lol.

It's false because Core is committed to scaling Bitcoin. Not freezing anything.
Where have you seen that Core is proposing to freeze the network with an arbitrary transaction cap?

@_date: 2016-03-23 13:32:19
Yeah, it will probably be pretty bad. Which is why it's really important not to try to ram through contentious hard forks. Even in the better scenarios, it could take a long time to undo the economic damage.
I figure Classic going through with a hard fork on their terms is something like a Bitcoin equivalent of nuclear war. Where both sides end up very badly damaged.
@_date: 2016-03-09 20:59:55
Possible, but unless you consider Coinbase part of that group, considering we know all the people behind Classic(or at least we think we do) and they're long time Bitcoiners as far as I know, it seems somewhat unlikely to me.
But I understand why many people are thinking this. Especially after the threads and media articles that were effectively an all out attempt to smear Bitcoin in the public eye. But I think these Classic people are probably desperate enough to try something like that, even though it's clearly a very anti-Bitcoin stance. It's the type of last ditch effort I'd expect from people who've decided it's all or nothing and plan to leave and/or compete with Bitcoin somehow in the future. And if the choice is to compete, then the collateral damage to Bitcoin is just a plus to them.
But really, you have to wonder what someone like Roger Ver is feeling when he sees that attack and the subsequent public shitstorm that followed. Considering he's been known to be one of the largest holders of BTC for a long time now, even if he supports Classic, something like that has to sting when you hold the amount of BTC that he's been known to hold.
@_date: 2016-03-12 12:40:39
Well, like Bitcoin it's not a single technology that makes it special or novel, but the sum of the parts as chosen and integrated by Satoshi. He didn't invent anything other than the system as a whole from what I've gathered.

I think that at this point the charade as gone on long enough that even if sanity prevails and Core continues the good work it's doing, it's already been shown that the social structure of Bitcoin is very weak and susceptible to anyone who knows some basic populist political tricks.
If it were just the users, the fat part of the curve Joe Six Bitcoin on Reddit complaining and mobilizing it wouldn't be very notable. But the fact that there are apparently a good amount of businesses and miners behind this joke makes the whole thing a lot less funny. And reveals that a large part of the market is weak and less than savvy.
It really has shown that this whole project rests on a much softer foundation than many believe/believed.

Wow, this is very surprising given the previous relative lack interest in Bitcoin there. Maybe something's changed. Or maybe this is just an odd day with a big volume spike. But that's still pretty significant I think.

I'm not saying anything about a corrupted ledger. A Bitcoin run by a cartel of miners can have a perfectly uncorrupted ledger and function normally. It just stops being very interesting if it turns out to be a psuedo-centralized blockchain.
The reality is that Bitcoin has had a massive shift towards mining centralization in China. These are the four main points on the issue I posted in the last big thread we had on here:
1) The government subsidized power that enables Chinese farms to operate with extremely low overhead.
2) The fact that due to 1) and other factors(hardware manufacturing is probably one), mining continues to centralize in China.
3) Many technically inclined people whose opinions I respect have suggested that larger blocks will contribute to further mining centralization due to the Great Firewall slowing the relaying of their blocks. Since Chinese miners are pseudo-segregated from the rest of the world, this results in them being more likely to build off of each others blocks since there's no firewall slowing their domestic connections down. Some people believe that bigger blocks will actually re-decentralize Bitcoin mining though, because of the Great Firewall. If that's so people should be bringing this issue to the forefront and debating it, it's a big deal.
4) China has an authoritarian one party government. In the future they may have reason to believe that the existence of Bitcoin is at the very least assisting in capital outflows, and what they might view as harming their economy. There are many different situations that could result in the Chinese government seeing Bitcoin as a threat. We know that a single entity controlling 50% of the hash is a huge issue were it to occur, and the idea that the Chinese government might one day decide to take control of mining farms on their soil isn't exactly the most far fetched idea.
@_date: 2016-01-01 15:58:56
I don't think they have that as even an option.
Someone would probably have to fork their work anonymously and change it to increase privacy.
The people working on it now definitely aren't going to touch that issue with a ten foot pole, seeing as how they would probably be locked up before the day is done.

of the key I prepared in 2013, and found that nobody could remember
where they put that envelope. Oh well.
If they had posted that 2nd(technically 3rd) address and people donated it to and they weren't able to access it because of this that would have sucked pretty badly. Salt on an already deep wound. 
Good that it sounds like everything worked out. That ~400 BTC or so is a good chunk of change. I've read so many heartbreakers about losses that now total in the millions, but you don't often see an assumed loss turn back into a windfall. So that's a nice change from the usual.
Is there any reason why they couldn't have just encrypted their private keys and then used their own decentralized storage software to back it up? I'm not too familiar with their project, but that's the first thing I thought of when I read that they were using Time Machines.

Antminer is annoying.
I wonder if there's any way for people to voice their displeasure with their empty block mining/SPV mining or whatever it is exactly. 
The obvious thing would be not to buy their products, or use their pool. But historically miners have never been good at voicing their displeasure through any way that they believe might lower their short term profit. But I can't really think of any way for the rest of the economy to send them a message to stop. Other than selling bitcoin and telling them that they're the reason. But since they're only one actor doing something that is considered bad, but not so much that it breaks the system or anything(thus why they do it, of course they wouldn't otherwise). And although there are others doing the same thing, I doubt that it's at any kind of point overall that would make people sell their bitcoin since it's not really something that has a direct effect on people, but from what I know is almost universally considered bad.
They're like the asshole on the train who decides to take up two seats while everyone is standing around. And when you ask them to move so someone else can sit as well, they tell you to fuck off because they can do what they want. Yes, they can do it. Doesn't mean they should or that they're not an asshole for doing so. Just because the protocol allows it, doesn't make it a positive action, or even neutral.
It's not like I expect them not to do it if they think it can increase their profits and that the upsides outweigh the downsides. What I want is that theoretical hand of the market to at least in the long term somehow make it so that the upsides don't outweigh the downsides for that type of anti-social miner behavior. I'm just not sure how exactly.
BitFury doesn't ever mine empty blocks/SPV mine as far as I know. So just as I hope there's some downside for Antminer in particular being the worst offender, I hope there's some benefit for BitFury in the long run for choosing a policy that's better for Bitcoin.

It was successful, they just rolled back to a block before it happened. And there's been a lot of security issues over the years too:
The specific incident with the 184 billion: 
It's pretty disingenuous to claim Bitcoin has never been hacked. Even if most of those recorded vulnerabilities might not qualify has a hack, since a lot of them are DoS methods(which could be argued either way I think in regards to whether or not those are hacks), someone exploiting that overflow bug to mine a block with 184 billion BTC definitely qualifies as a hack. 
Also note CVE-2010-5141 which allowed people to spend others coins. That's a solid 2 hacks already.
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:09:37
It's always been known by most non-delusional Bitcoiners that should a powerful state actor decide to target Bitcoin that it would essentially kill it. Sure, it might exist as some shell of its former self among hardcore enthusiasts and such. But a state that was serious about taking out Bitcoin would just crush it economically. I don't even think they'd have to waste the money on tech based attacks, but those would make it even worse.
That's just living in reality. It's always going to be like that unless we get to a situation where you have a state or many states actively supporting and defending Bitcoin from other states.
So far though no state has shown any real aggression or fear so there's not much to worry about imo. The biggest threat would currently obviously be the Chinese state. But they seem fine with it so far though.
@_date: 2017-03-30 08:15:02

I don't think they work well together personally. But if Gavin decided to put his talents to use on a different Bitcoin related project that was meant to add value to the economy I think some good things could happen. I think the days of Gavin working on Core are far behind us. They just don't trust each other any longer and a professional separation is probably the healthiest thing for all of them.

It's good to see the delusions and contact high from all that VC money that came in 2014 are wearing off and we're getting back to reality. And the people still around trying to make things work are the ones who are able to take an objective look at reality and avoid riding unsubstantiated hype. In the long run those are the people who are going to be building the real Bitcoin economy, not the bullshit peddlers and pumpers.
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:08:47


How is that a lie? Did I say that they're raising the max block size cap? No. 
It's been reported as resulting in around twice as many transactions being able to fit in a block. Thus in effect it results in a capacity increase without changing the current maximum size of our blocks. If we raise the max to 2MB it would provide a similar amount of transactions as a 4MB block would without segwit, 4MB as 8MB and so on. This is a pretty amazing upgrade.

I feel like hardly anyone has any idea of how good Wlad, Pieter, and Greg are. And then all the other people that help with Core.
Gavin especially has done fuck all in the last couple of years except collect his $200k per year, and start this whole drama by putting his reputation on the line that Bitcoin is ready and able to hard fork from 1MB to 20MB. Well, guess what, that would have been fucking retarded. Congrats Gavin, all your time off from development resulted in a colossal miscalculation.
Jeff appears to have been uninvolved in Core development for a long period of time too. I don't know the specifics so I'm not going make a claim either way with him. But one thing I will say is that BIP100 wasn't good enough, and if he's pulling this Classic stunt as a reaction to BIP100 being rejected by the technical community then that's incredibly disappointing.

@_date: 2016-03-05 19:10:53
Regardless of what you think of segwit, there is evidence that they're working on that. I don't see how requiring wallets to upgrade makes it poor though.
There's also the HK agreement for those people who attended to put for their patch for a blocksize increase. The miners are onboard with it, as well as the people who signed the agreement. We'll see how that is received by the wider community soon.
Other people are working on Lightning and sidechains as well. Which are both far more promising for scaling Bitcoin than any combination of segwit and a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2016-03-19 14:22:20


I respect the ideal of nonviolence and voluntarism as well. But it's stuff like this, and really pretty much everything I've witnessed in Bitcoin over the years, slowly but surely made me heavily skeptical of anything but small scale AC working well in reality given the current status of human culture. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 14:28:09
Ok, but people should begin to see that the people like Mike and Gavin who were ready to go with some insane plans, including a hard fork direct to 20MB should not be the people the community follows. Putting your reputation on the line and claiming you tested something that was later revealed to be far more dangerous than you claimed should carry an obvious loss of faith. Yet there's a large group of people who continue to ignore that.
Core is obviously absolutely committed to scaling. Including raising the block size if necessary. My impression of the situation is this:
There are a lot of variables now that need to be determined still. Over the next year we will form a very good idea of just what exactly needs to happen to ensure the foundation is laid technologically for Bitcoin to scale long term. 
People demanding Core to make a commitment to a date and size for a block size increase are misunderstanding Core's position I believe. It is likely that the block size will be raised at some point, since I have read that Lightning will need larger blocks. So if it is determined after the appropriate amount of time that the default block size will need to be raised as part of the overall plan to increase capacity, it will be. But when and what size really depends on other factors that aren't fully clear yet. Maybe it will need to be raised to 4MB, maybe 3.1415MB. Committing to a 2MB hard fork right now just to placate people is silly when the technical foundation is still being constructed now and we don't have all the data that would be necessary to really evaluate just how large the block size should be and why. It really does depend on what pans out here over the next few months. I don't see why that's so hard for people to accept.
The only argument that people really seem to make is that they simply don't trust Core to follow through on scaling. Personally, I trust that they are working to scale Bitcoin. And they will increase the block size if and when it makes sense in the overall scheme of things.
@_date: 2016-01-27 09:03:16
The way you pose it here is very far from the way I see the situation. You write it as if they're submitting a pull request to Core when they're proposing an aggressive low consensus(75%) hard forking of Bitcoin as well as a complete coup and effective firing of the Core devs. They're taking the capacity increases roadmap and agreement( signed by a very large amount of people in the technical community after lots of research and discussion, including two 'Scaling Bitcoin' conferences, and completely going against the technical consensus. 
Lots of discussion was going on before about 2MB. BIP102 has been out for a long time. I supported going with BIP102 and waiting a year to see what happens before making any further changes. After segwit was announced and would provide a similar buffer for transaction throughput, and the roadmap was released, there was no longer any reason for me to keep supporting BIP102. As we will be effectively getting a similar result, without having to do a hard fork.


Unless things have changed in the last 24 hours, Classic hasn't proposed any code at all and have exclusively relied on political tactics.
I appreciate your tone and the way you approach the topic, but I really think you're downplaying the severity of the situation. As well as taking a much too generous view of the motivations behind certain peoples actions.

I agree that Theymos has very likely singlehandedly produced more discord in the community than anyone thus far. And the DDoSing is counterproductive and childish. Whoever is behind the DDoSing really needs to stop that shit. But neither of those things are related to Core itself. 
In my view Core hasn't said no at all to bigger blocks. In fact if segwit wasn't developed I'm almost certain we would be looking at a 2MB blocksize in Core as well. But since segwit will enable the possibility for wallets to integrate those types of transactions we will be able to effectively create blocks that can approach 2MB. So for now Core's capacity will be increased in a similar way. 
So I believe they want a 12 month period to observe and get further in to developing all the other projects that are intended to add capacity to Bitcoin. I don't think that's unreasonable. And I really don't think that it's so unreasonable that the community should can Core and go with another implementation that's not offering anything other than 2MB max blocks. There's a very good chance that Core will be upping the max blocksize in 12 months anyway. They certainly haven't decided to stick with 1MB forever.
With RBF the fact that it's opt-in and people can already double spend zero conf makes it less of an issue for me. But I understand that some people believe it will negatively effect their retail experience. I don't really have too strong of an opinion on it though.
I guess I just have a different view of the people behind Core and their intentions. I don't get a similar impression at all and I think there's a lot of reasonable and capable people involved with Core, and the work they've done and are doing now is exceptional and should be supported by the community.

I posted this the last time this was discussed yesterday([link]( so I might as well post it here as well:
I have nothing against the people building Open Bazaar at all, and I support the spirit of their efforts. But based on my reading so far it seems like another Bitcoin solution in search of a problem unfortunately.
I hope my impression is wrong. But I can't help but notice how many people in Bitcoin are pinning their hopes on Open Bazaar being some sort of game changer without actually realizing that it's not a censorship resistant marketplace, it's a desktop app where you can host your own storefront and sell things. And buyers can use a 2 of 3 escrow to help avoid fraud.
Nothing about that is inherently bad or anything, it's cool that some legitimate new technology is being built. But it's also a completely new paradigm of commerce, that's separate from the World Wide Web. Think about that for a second. We like to talk about network effect here a lot, Open Bazaar is trying to build something from scratch on a separate network, off web, that as of now effectively has zero users. That's an incredibly tall order. I hope they can do it, everyone wins if they can, but whoever is in charge of user acquisition probably has the most challenging job of their career ahead of them. You can't just direct them to your website, you need them to install your software. And they need to know how to use Bitcoin.
I'll add that if there are some other incentives that OpenBazaar is going to have that I'm missing, please let me know. I want it to work, it's just hard to imagine a scenario where it becomes the killer app of Bitcoin.

I'm getting the impression that Classic is going to end up being another failure like XT, so quite possibly. Yesterday it seemed dangerously close to being a very real threat, but I think sanity will prevail.
Is there a betting market where we can wager on these things by any chance?
@_date: 2016-01-18 08:52:55


No, the idea is *exactly* that. And if you've been told any differently then you've been deceived.
The main difference is with Core the 'throne' is manned by a large group of very intelligent developers, some of which can be seen here: 
And many of which are probably not going to be interested in following the group that has complete disregard for their technical opinions.
It's just the reality of a consensus based system like Bitcoin. There's no way that Core and Classic can co-exist on one chain. Two chains, two 'Bitcoins', sure.
And you already have Classic devs taking unilateral authoritarian actions on your codebase:

Watching so many in the community get pulled along on this power play is really sad to see. There's no other way to describe it.

I don't really blame him too much since I'm pretty sure his focus is 100% on his startup. So tbh I'm not really too surprised that he's a bit off here since I highly doubt he spends any appreciable amount of time following everything that goes on here. Especially for what looks like a spur of the moment brain dump on twitter.
I do think that 21 could use an employee that interfaces with the community though and keeps the flow of information going both ways. Keeping up on the pulse of Bitcoin is a full time job pretty much, and it makes sense that a bunch of engineers working on a big project don't bother wasting their time sorting through all the noise on here(nor should they really).

Nice. I had a feeling that Classic jumped the shark yesterday after Mike Toonim had his Howard Dean moment in the Core Slack.
When you base your whole coup on politics, it doesn't take much to derail it since there's no substance behind it.
Also, Gavin making it clear that he has no interest in being the Lead Maintainer and that he's just around to help it get going is another bullet.
On a side note, has anyone seen any statements from Jeff Garzik about this? I'm kind of shocked that he would throw away his credibility in the Bitcoin community to join up with the shitshow that is Classic.
Not only Garzik but a lot of people have some serious explaining to do. I've never seen so many people lose their credibility in the community in such a short period of time.

It's all about game theory between the users(economic majority) and the miners. Users choose a time period where it makes no economic sense for miners to pursue specialized hardware such as ASICs over general purpose.
6 months is probably in the ballpark I'm guessing. But a dynamic time limit could be even better too should chip fabrication ever become somewhat trivial, cheaper, and much quicker than it is now somehow in the future due to technological advancements.

If you mean back in the way earlier days when it was BitcoinQT, I doubt it personally, although it's just a hunch. It's possible that he did anonymously(which is what I think you're suggesting). But I remember the day he finally came to say 'hi' in the newbie forum(old site policy, funny to see it apply to him) to the project that integrated his Hashcash technology, and the timing and subsequent communication didn't indicate that he had been involved previously. And it's not like he wouldn't have had something to gain by getting involved earlier with his real identity. 
He did end up getting involved at a good time though. And at this point it doesn't really matter at what point he decided it was a worthwhile project anyway since he obviously fully integrated himself a while ago.
@_date: 2016-01-16 15:51:51
They don't have to consult with them, nor do they need their blessing.
But what they've done is effectively told people in involved with Core to fuck off. It's purely a political move to remove Wlad, Pieter, Greg, Adam and others. Being willing to throw away 3 comp sci PhDs there and Greg who might as well have a PhD in Bitcoin is not a very smart decision imo.
Bitcoin has had very little innovation until recently, and now in the last short while that group has come up with tech like confidential transactions and segwit. Both appear to be on all accounts great upgrades for Bitcoin that will help keep it competitive. These are the best developers in Bitcoin with great ideas and years of experience. Pushing them out of Bitcoin now is such a shame. 
What's really crazy about it too is that Classic is upgrading to 2MB, but Core is in the process of adding segwit which will also allow more transactions in to blocks, close to 2MB worth if wallets update their software so they can use those transactions. The idea that people want to cut out top Bitcoin developers just so they can add 1MB to the blocksize and gain control is just such an obvious political move rather than a technical disagreement. It's not like Core is 100% against raising the blocksize, but they have new tech in the form of segwit which they can add now and observe for the next year to see how the network evolves with segwit, lightning, sidechain and other technologies.
@_date: 2016-01-09 16:24:29

To me this just sounds like a way to excuse the community from taking responsibility for the situation that we find ourselves in now. 
It's not like we don't know who the players are in this thing. And we've observed the whole thing develop over a long time now. I don't see any evidence to think that there's some mysterious third party that wants to destroy Bitcoin involved. 
There's Bitcoiners who want to do things that will likely result in the downfall of Bitcoin, but I'm pretty sure they actually think what they're doing is right. But I understand how it's hard to believe that these actions aren't malicious given how ridiculous this whole thing is.

If the emission schedule fails to support the security of the network then people will obviously try to fix it if it's glaringly obvious at some point that it was an economic miscalculation.
Of course lots of people might refuse and leave on principle. But people aren't just going to let it die. It might effectively be dead from being out completed at that point, but people won't just throw in the towel if there's still economic incentive for them to continue.

Personally I hope that some of the liquidity moves over to Poloniex now since they seem to be the most trustworthy exchange for alts. Lower spreads there from increased volume would be better for both Shapeshift and your customers.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:36:53
You have the base issues completely right about the mining situation, but GPU mining is probably not going to happen and would also result in a similar situation as we have now. 
Perhaps in the short term GPU mining is comparatively better when viewed in a vacuum against ASIC mining. But in the longer term view a lot of the same issues persist. But if a PoW change does happen there might very well be a window of time where GPU mining will dominate depending on what the change is and how long the period is where people can prepare for it. Lots of GPU altcoins have ended up being mined by ASICs, Litecoin being the biggest example. I'm not sure there's anyway to stop proprietary hardware from becoming standard and outcompeting more general purpose hardware like consumer GPUs or even CPUs as some algos try to even make it hard for GPUs to mine. But again, often the CPU aimed algos end up being GPU mined which again can lead to further specialized hardware.
But it's good that you are thinking about what I consider the biggest fundamental issue with Bitcoin that is *mostly* ignored by the community at large, probably just because the solutions just aren't there. Lots of developers and such to acknowledge the issues, so I don't want to overstate the 'ignoring the issue' part. But still, it's easily the biggest existential threat to Bitcoin imo.

and are just not very good subs. As much as I think some of the moderation policies here are bad, this sub is still vastly superior to those two in terms of content and discussion. And this sub isn't very good to begin with either, but it's what we have and there's definitely some really good posters around. 
is fine for a niche sub for people who want to discuss that implementation, but it's never going to be a general community wide discussion sub like this one is.
If a large group of varied people from the community wanted to put their heads together and discuss what type of sub would benefit the community and help foster open discussion and debate that would be good. Something like that with some clear goals and thought put into policy could have a decent chance of out competing this sub.

@_date: 2016-03-05 15:09:43
I don't think Classic is a conspiracy. It's not like it's a secret what they want to do. 
I believe that a good amount of people, especially low information Bitcoin users have totally bought into to their narrative. It's not that hard to believe, just look at American politics. If them believing all of the bullshit is going to cause them to leave Bitcoin entirely then I don't really know what I can say. I just hope Gavin, Mike, Jeff, Roger, Oliver, and Brian are happy with what they've done.
I think that they think what they're doing is right. And that the ends justify the means. But other than maybe Oliver and Roger, I can't really imagine those guys really believe all the "BlockstreamCore" conspiracy crap that all these average users are so angry about, and what's apparently causing them to leave Bitcoin. So if they're comfortable with what they've done, supporting a false narrative to try to win via what I consider dirty political means, then I guess I don't have anything to say to the people behind it all either. If they think this type of stuff is kosher, or if they realize it's not so good, but are willing to try to ride on a wave of lies to victory, then all I can say is I hope that they leave Bitcoin sooner rather than later. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:33:27
I think there will be ways in the not to distant future too. But the OpenBazaar devs can't involve themselves in it.
Someone might fork their work though and try to make it censorship resistant.
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:42:14
Okay, but some of those devs consider it likely that if blocks become bigger, the reduced speed in which they propagate internationally will actually lead to more orphans for the people outside of China. So yes, the lower blocksize suits transmission across the firewall, but they're also saying that the alternative of raising the blocksize will lead to increased centralization in China. Which at this point is something that is already dangerously close to being centralized, if not arguably already.
Some people think that the bigger blocks will hinder the Chinese miners are spread the hash outside of China more. That's interesting if true, and if anyone has any links to people making that argument I wouldn't mind taking a look.

When I see people make those claims, to me they're literally trying to say that Greg, Adam and others have spent their entire professional lives crafting an image of someone interested in the exact opposite of what the conspiracy theorists are claiming they are. As well as publicly taking actions to demonstrate their beliefs despite possible consequences(Greg: jstor, Adam: munitions).
So either 20 years later they've managed to reveal their master evil plan in the form of a company that primary works on open source software, or there's a large amount of people in the Bitcoin community who appear to be fucking idiots.

Someone mentioned the idea in that big thread on here that nullc/gmaxwell was posting in yesterday. And Greg didn't dismiss the idea outright at all. He said that the code for that change was ready to go.
When he said that I was really surprised and I wanted to know exactly what he was talking about. And when I came across Luke suggesting to use Keccak as the PoW algo I thought that this must have been what Greg was referring to.
It would be an interesting situation if all of this SHA256 hash power pushes the Classic hard fork, but then Core responds with their own hard fork changing the PoW to SHA-3/Keccak. That would be like blowing up the bridge between the two implementations and the two new chains that will result.

It's a fork away from Core though. It's not going to be merged into Core(at least that appears to be the case since apparently they didn't even approach Core to begin with). 
Choosing Classic is effectively a vote to kill Core and push out the Core development team. Except for Garzik who's with Classic I guess.

That they realize that the consensus is with Core. Else they would be running Classic from fear of the market crashing. But they realize that they would lose more from running Classic, so they don't.

Is this situation any different than looking at the Chromium or Firefox source code to get similar information about what your browser tracks?
I know that Chrome isn't necessarily a direct copy of Chromium too, so maybe Firefox is a better example alone unless a user specifically uses Chromium over Chrome.

Gavin has said that he has no intentions of becoming the lead maintainer as he was in the past for QT, and that he just wants to help get the project going down the right path. I think it's good that he was honest about his intentions early on here. 
So it appears jtoomim is going to be leading the project. And, sure its open source and anyone can submit pull requests. But I think the vast majority of currently active talented contributors are people contributing to Core, and I don't think too many people are going to be interested in doing the same for Classic.
If Classic messes up, by that point a lot of people are going to be completely alienated from that chain anyway. Sure someone will try to keep it going. But it's more likely that if Classic messes up people just jump over to the Core chain. Or maybe some alt that's not in the same chaotic state as Bitcoin is.
If Bitcoin Classic forks off it's going to be messy. There will be people dumping huge amounts on both chains. There will be people wanting to keep the non-Classic chain alive, and will do so via a change of PoW if necessary too. And the thing is Classic isn't even offering any real plan or real value. So I honestly think anyone seriously considering backing it needs to take a deep breath and try to detach themselves from the emotional arguments that most supporters make towards conspiracy theories and communist revolution rhetoric, and really consider if it's worth throwing away the best developers in the space for a project that feels like it was planned out on a cocktail napkin at the bar the night before it was announced(statement not meant to be targeted at you, but the wider group).

Agree with you 100%. If Bitcoin gets known as a tool used in China to assist in capital outflows we will be in a very dangerous situation against an authoritarian one party government. Especially considering so much of the network hash rate is physically located in China.
We now have so much mining and so much trade volume going on in China now that a crackdown could easily be deadly. The network will still exist, Bitcoin itself won't go anywhere, but the economic damage could be hard to recover from.
First rule of Bitcoin in China should be: Don't talk about Bitcoin.

Yeah, but segwit wasn't a factor before when almost everyone, including myself had no problem with a 2MB increase. But now because of segwit 2 becomes ~4, 4 would become ~8 and so on.
So we're already effectively getting the 2 that most of us seem to be fine with. My opinion last year from reading the debates was going with BIP102 and observing for a year before making any further changes to see how other scaling projects pan out(LN, sidechains, whatever else). 
Even though it's in a roundabout way, we're getting that 2MB through segwit. And we're getting the 12 months to see what happens. So even though the BIP102 that I previously supported isn't going to happen, I can't complain since segwit gives us the extra space as well as making things like LN easier to integrate since it fixes malleability. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 14:17:34
There's always block space if you're willing to pay a sufficient fee. It's just a question of how that information gets presented to you and whether it's correct or not.
If the fee is too high, then you can attach a fee that will balance your willingness to pay and estimated time till confirmation. But again, it's up to the software to relay a reasonable estimate to users.
If the fees in general are too high, then it's a good thing that we have so many people working on all these different methods of providing options that will allow people alternative ways of transferring value that will result in lower costs.

This guy was a bouncer in the UK. Bitcoin being Bitcoin, the guy somehow managed to raise over a million dollars to open some kind of Bitcoin bank type operation in ~~Malta~~ Cyprus. 
He acted like he was some rich Bitcoin early adopter when he wasn't, apparently bought(?) a Bentley with what now appears to be investors funds. Paid for lots of advertising in Cyprus and blew a lot of smoke up the media and peoples' asses.
Yadda yadda, there was no substance to any of it. Investors lost lots of money. He fled the country. And another chapter in Bitcoin history was written.
That's a very rough view from someone not involved. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable can shed some more light on what happened.

I'm not super familiar with how it works yet, but I can't imagine that they would design it like that. I'm guessing some nodes or something in the network would host storefronts or whatever, right? Is that what you mean by self hosted? Relying on nodes or something?

Hmm, my impression is more like someone was willing to damage Bitcoin, but thought that by doing this that they would cause more good than harm in the long run. And I think they thought the good they would cause would be people switching to Classic. But at this point I think it is clearly having the opposite effect, as now that things are 20/20 in hindsight, it really let people see that the Bitcoin protocol is solid and that wallet software is the weakest link once again.
With his second point, the fact that Coinbase and Brian in particular have apparently done nothing(?) to contribute to solving the issues they complain about speaks volumes.

The reason to change the PoW is more about security rather than keeping miners from coming back. If you're a minority chain all of a sudden there's a very large amount of hash power that could choose to attack you at any time.
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:03:12
Great, thanks for relaying that info to us.
The irony here is that Luke has been supporting that for a very long time I believe, and it's nothing new. But when he submitted it to Bitcoin Classic and jtoonim snap closed it with a unilateral decision, that caught the attention of many people. And the idea became publicized simply because people were critical of jtoonim's policy(or lack there of) on the Classic github repo. So he may have indirectly derailed the miner support due to a minor Streisand effect. Very interesting stuff.
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:20:54
Just because Core as no plan right now to increase the blocksize and hasn't committed to doing so doesn't mean they won't though. And personally I'm confident that they'll be able to make the decision to raise the max blocksize in the future if they believe it will contribute to scaling Bitcoin. And it likely will be one of the elements that will be part of the set of things that will allow Bitcoin to further increase its capacity.
It seems that the issue mainly comes down to trust for many people. People here now don't seem to trust Core. I trust their technical abilities and think they'll be the best group to balance decentralization and scale.
What I don't understand is how everyone can trust Gavin after he put his reputation on the line by claiming jumping from 1MB to 20MB blocks were safe and fine for the network. Had people accepted his hard fork proposal, right now in 2016 we could have been dealing with the result of that. Even now the range of block sizes people on the larger block side are advocating for range from 2 to 8MB. Looking back on that should give people some pause.

People in the Bitcoin community seem to really love invoking this. But it's something that's completely subjective and open to various interpretations by different people.
Unless there's something specific in writing which is cryptographically signed by the people that are supposed to be beholden to some explicit set of social values, it's really useless just having 'social contract' as some nebulous idea that's supposed to govern behavior.

I think his intentions are good here, and he does attach the proper disclaimers before he gives his opinion, but I think it would be better if he stuck to 'no comment' on these types of questions. Just because I've noticed that his answers keep being twisted and used for propaganda purposes against Core, as we can see for example here in this post. It's certainly not his fault whatsoever, it's just the reality of the type of political games that people are trying to play now to downplay the severity of a hard fork to another Bitcoin implementation away from the skilled and experienced devs behind Core. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:31:53


How is everyone not freaking out over the miners recent actions? The day you let a cartel of miners localized in a single country start dictating consensus changes is the day you need to wake up and realize that there's a problem.

@_date: 2016-01-01 07:38:38
Downplay? What makes you say that? I'm probably one of the biggest apologists here regarding permissioned blockchains. I'm constantly pointing out their utility while people dismiss them here. Especially the fact that any 'bankchain' with a reasonably sane security arrangement is going to be vastly more secure than Bitcoin's blockchain.
I do think they're fundamentally different than Bitcoin though. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 08:01:31


In 2009-2012 people were often told Bitcoin was anonymous. That eventually stopped happening, but a lot of people were lead in to a false sense of security.
In 2011-2015 people were often told Bitcoin was free to use without transaction fees. It was true early on, but not for long.
Till this day people are still told Bitcoin is inherently deflationary, when it has an emission schedule that inflates the money supply. It is price deflationary if supply is less than the demand, which is rarely mentioned after someone calls it deflationary.
Till this day people are told Bitcoin is unhackable. Even though people have managed to both mine a block with 184 billion BTC, and exploit a flaw that lets someone spend coins that they do not have the private key for. 
People who questioned Bitcoin's ability to scale for years were dismissed and called trolls. It was very often claimed that scaling was as simple as changing the max block size. Clearly that is not the case.
Lots of people signed up for something different than what they got. The community over the years has been decidedly biased in promoting lies and half truths in an attempt pump or sustain the price. Many people have been mislead. It's been bad, people are angry and they have a right to be. Only thing we can do is try to stop letting people get away with promoting Bitcoin as something that its not.

I'm a huge supporter of the idea behind PoS and think it will eventually have its day in the sun. But I think it's safe to say that Bitcoin will never, ever, have any sort of hard fork to add PoS. Even a PoS/PoW hybrid. I think way too many people in the Bitcoin community would consider that sacrilege, or at least a violation of their imagined social contract.

Hmm, I'm a bit surprised that they would feature the device as part of the course. I expected something more like they would open the 21 API to people registered in the course. Are they not doing that at all? It kind of goes against the whole spirit of these free open classes that are meant to attract people from all over the world with various economic situations.
I don't think I could order a device even if I wanted to since I don't live in the US. Maybe that's changed? Even if so, where I live $400 is more than most people take home in a month of work.

I assume they're working on mitigation techniques, so yeah 'anyone' can do it if they know how to submit their own transactions or use a script(like Peter Todd's doublespend.py). But I'm assuming the point is to find people who are better than the average person who just double spends in the obvious way of submitting a second, higher fee transaction. Maybe someone who takes advantage of the network topology of nodes or something.

This statement is pretty ridiculous in general. But even so, they are effectively raising the blocksize with segwit.
@_date: 2016-01-23 18:58:04
And that's only the tip of the iceberg. There's also the security issues of new DoS attacks that can exploit larger blocks. I'd hope all of those attacks can be prevented or mitigated, but it has to be approached careful by people who know what the're doing.
And the fact that larger blocks can't get through the Great Firewall of China very quickly, but inside of China all these mega miners have nothing restricting their own p2p block relaying. This could result in further centralization in China due to miners there being more likely to build off of each others blocks since they'll see them faster and it's possible that even today 50% or so of the mining hardware is already hashing in China. 
At this point anything that could drive more mining inside of a country with an authoritarian "communist" government should be ringing alarm bells.
Qualified, smart, experienced developers are absolutely key to the future of Bitcoin. Anyone attempting to simplify or trivialize these issues is likely doing so out of ignorance, or ulterior motives.
@_date: 2016-01-03 12:39:54
None of these blockchains will ever be using PoW. They're not going to anything like Bitcoin at all. PoW only makes sense for a permissionless blockchain. And to that end, no one in their right mind uses SHA256 as the PoW anyway these days for the reason you mentioned.
@_date: 2016-01-12 17:15:46
Yes, I guess that lumps too many people with too wide of a range of opinions into that one category.
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:10:07
You're just wrong. A federated blockchain run by banks all over the world with hundreds of millions to spend on servers if they want to will crush Bitcoin in speed and cost. I don't think you understand that decentralization at the level of Bitcoin has a cost. Their blockchain will have a different paradigm of decentralization(it will be federated, like Ripple and the Elements sidechain), and because of that it won't have many of the same technical restrictions as a PoW style blockchain it will easily be able to absolutely crush Bitcoin in every aspect of speed.
Did you read the article that the person above us linked to? 
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:26:10

@_date: 2017-03-15 11:14:43
The existence of BU is just a weight around the neck of Bitcoin dragging it down a bit. 
These people have to be absolutely out of their minds to support BU. Like regardless of opinions on Bitcoin scaling, BU is an utter joke and just irresponsible.
At the very least I would think that the vast majority of 'big blockers' would be in a group that labels itself something like '2MB, but not BU'. That is comparatively reasonable. But apparently people are irrational and easily swayed by emotion.
@_date: 2016-01-28 11:51:53
We'll see how people feel if the network security starts declining and fees and the value of BTC aren't sustaining the network. 
Not saying it's going to happen, but asking people now when we've just passed an exahash and seeing insane gains every two weeks in hashing is kind of useless. 
Satoshi's chosen economic model is still an experiment, and it's not guaranteed to work by any means. Yet people seem to think that the default economic configuration was handed down from the heavens or something.
Actually I think part of the reason people treat 21 like it's a religious number is the reality of just how easy it would be to change it if there was the will. Thus people overcompensate and try to create a culture of reverence towards that emission schedule.
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:30:35
People are out there for sure. But they're generally very expensive, and like you say paying them would likely be required given the amount of skill, effort, and time it takes. With Core for the longest time Wlad, Pieter, and Greg weren't getting paid at all. Now Pieter and Greg are founders in Blockstream, so that gives them something. Haven't heard of Wlad taking any money though.
If we had a few million dollars to recruit a bunch of top talent then I agree with you that it's definitely possible and realistic. It's hard to find really good volunteers though.
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:36:03


That's interesting, I hadn't heard that proposal yet.
I guess the big issue for Core would be the hard fork since it seems they want to avoid doing that for now.
I think personally I'd rather see this happen than Classic taking over.
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:59:40


You say this as if it's proposed as is rather than an 'if and only if' situation. 
And I disagree that it's relatively non-contentious. Like what are you even saying is relatively non-contentious to begin with? Bitcoin Classic? Chinese miners 'making a patch', whatever that's supposed to mean(obviously it won't get merged into Core, so are they claiming they're going to start their own implementation?). Both of these situations are contentious. Classic is contentious already, and this idea that Chinese miners can try moves like this is sure to be contentious as soon as everyone hears the absurdity of what they are proposing.
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:53:00
Yeah, wait, don't you know that everyone means Bitcoin? And all this talk about distributed fintech, blockchains, permissioned ledgers are all just a giant secret code that really means Bitcoin?! They'll all come crawling back, yup. Blockchain without Bitcoin? More like fish without water! Am I right?!
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:50:52
Capital controls are easy to avoid if you already have BTC. But any government wanting to plug the leak could easily crack down on businesses selling BTC to people within their borders. Seems like that's the most obvious way to stop the average person from moving value outside of the country.
But the unfortunate special situation we have here with China is probably close to half, if not half already, of our network's physical hash power is on Chinese soil. So if China gets serious about stemming capital outflows, not only can they easily block the exchanges that sell BTC and such, but they can physically attack the network if they wished by taking control of mining farms. And a slightly less likely but even more dangerous situation is if they attack through some additional state funded and constructed mining farms. Then the issue of possibly not being able to take over enough hash at the existing farms becomes moot.
This is why we should always be ready to change the PoW if necessary. Although if the situation I mentioned where the Chinese government was willing to mount attacks by hashing themselves, then either way we'd be in a tough and possibly unwinnable battle.
@_date: 2016-01-01 09:03:00
I think it's likely to be either very good, or very bad. 
If the Chinese government continues to turn a blind eye towards Bitcoin, it's going to be good.
If they notice that Bitcoin is facilitating significant outflows and decide to do something about it, it could result in some unprecedented events.
@_date: 2016-01-21 09:39:22

Someone should fund it or be the point of contact for a crowdfunding.
It's a pretty significant chunk of translation work there and probably fairly difficult. But I also think it's extremely important that this gets out there in Chinese, since apparently Jihan just made a comment comparing the technical skill between Core and BU as 90 vs 60. Which is absolutely ridiculous. And anyone who reads this should realize that Jihan making such a comparison essentially saps any credibility they may have once believed he had.

From what I understand the situation is much more complicated than that.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:22:43
And many people dismissed my suggestions last year of market participants actively supporting good actors like BitFury, while economically rejecting incredibly obvious bad actors like Jihan/Bitmain.
Free market capitalism does not and will not work when you just blindly accept whatever is offered without considering the bigger picture. But so many people seem to think that all it means is some sort of simple robot acceptance of whatever is convenient and cheapest.
I guess I don't really know how to explain the concept well enough, but 'the market' only really works when the participants are thinking more than one step ahead about what is actually rational in the long term. And that includes collective social action(gasp) to put economic pressure on elements that are 'bad'. It's not every man for himself, really it's better when the 'good' actors leverage their power to drive out the 'bad' actors. I don't understand why many seem to think that's somehow antithetical to capitalism, but it's not.
Jihan is Bitcoin's worst nightmare next to government conflict: He's a huge miner who has no idea what's in his best long term interest. He breaks some of the most basic assumptions about Bitcoin's incentive structure. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:48:38

Well, you might see this as even worse, but that HK deal doesn't even have consensus within Core itself from what I understand.
@_date: 2016-03-08 16:13:51
So depending on variance around 4% of miners?
Also, the idea that at this point the Classic node count has to be artificially inflated via AWS free tier nodes *just to get to 20%* makes me wonder why anyone is bothering at all. Classic came out making grand claims of massive consensus. Reality is that there's barely anything behind the curtain.
Is there like a DOA date for Classic like XT had in early Jan? Is it soon?
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:07:57
Short term thinking by idiot miners. Not the first time and probably not the last.
And it's not even proper short term thinking since they're likely going to lose more in devaluation and stalled growth then they think they're going to make up on fees. 
It's really just stupid on so many levels.

@_date: 2016-03-07 15:35:47
Nothing directly. But there's widespread confusion surrounding the HK meeting with many wildly different interpretations of just what that meeting meant and many assumptions about just what that meant for 'Core'. 
I remember you specifically speaking out against it immediately after it happened. So all I really know about what's going on is that you are against it, and that the people who signed it apparently intend to stick to their agreement and release that patch in the summer or whatever it was exactly. I don't know how any of the other people involved with Core feel about it, particularly people like Pieter, Greg, Wlad.
Maybe I missed a post on here or something where someone broke it down for us what the current opinions were related to that, but if so I missed it. If there's someone involved with Core who handles or assists the 'softer' side of the workload(writing, communication type things rather than engineering) maybe a quick survey to get where people stand right now would be beneficial. Even just a line or two summarizing what they think and why might help shed some light on where we stand right now.
Just a suggestion if people have the time. Thus far I've been somewhat uncomfortable taking the 'wait until summer to see exactly where we're at once the patch is released'. Even though that will ultimately begin the actual process of consensus(or lack there of), perhaps some people in the community would be interested in more of a heads up of what the current state is among Core people.

Really? I'm not too familiar with how it works, but with whole 2 of 3 multisig thing it sounds like it would only work with BTC unless the devs went out of their way to add a similarly functioning cryptocurrency.
If vendors have enough control over their storefront or whatever to add Visa as a payment option that's kind of interesting.

Perhaps from now on we should require that anyone in charge of an exchange or similar service make a public declaration that they actually understand what the term cold wallet means. With a specific description included. Because this term gets thrown around so lightly that it's starting to lose its meaning, even though it's probably the single most important element of proper Bitcoin security.

Pretty sure that Reddit is anything but Core's primary communication tool, and reading that makes it more clear why there appears to be people who think that Core doesn't communicate. If you're expecting that communication to come primarily from here, then you're going to be disappointed.
We could debate what Core's primary communication tool is or has been in the past. But lets skip that since they now have their own homepage which should answer the question of  what that primary channel is today.

@_date: 2016-01-26 14:37:56
I agree with you. But I've always thought that in general people have vastly underestimated how easy it is to make a fundamental change to Bitcoin via forks. People have always spoken of things like the 'social contract', and immutability of Bitcoin, but I think most of that is an illusion, and people projecting what they wish Bitcoin was rather than what it actually is. I always viewed it as something that can easily be molded by the community. Sometimes that's a strength, but the trade off for that is the danger of people turning it in to something that ends up being a mistake.
Doesn't mean Bitcoin can't continue to do well as our digital gold. But the risks in general are probably far higher than most people believe(and clearly you have figured it out for yourself here). But I think for now we're not in such a bad spot. I really think at this point the chances of something like Classic happening are pretty low. And even if it did happen, I think a lot of major players would be behind a PoW change to keep the version of Bitcoin that we're using now alive. Then there's still a good chance that the Bitcoin backed by quality developers and people less susceptible to elementary level political games will continue to flourish in the long run. 
While the fork that goes off on its SHA-256 journey will very likely just end up a centralized currency dominated by Chinese miners and Chinese users who view Bitcoin trading as a form of entertainment/gambling. Normally I'd just say that the SHA-256 fork would just slowly drift towards centralization and die off eventually. But China probably has the economic power to keep it going, even if it transforms into something completely different than what we envision a decentralized cryptocurrency to be.

The issue isn't about that. It's the security and DoS angle first and foremost. No one today believes that we would be fine jumping to 20MB now that we've explored the issue and realize there are multiple angles at which people can take advantage.
Even with 2MB being fairly safe, there's still the issue of the 2MB transaction that takes 10 minutes to verify that needs to be solved.  20MB would have been a completely shitshow from multiple angles.  Unless you assume that no one would try to attack Bitcoin, as people like macillin do now for for shits and giggles with no financial gain.

A federated blockchain is like the sidechain Elements Alpha. Bitcoin isn't federated though.
Although I think having some federated sidechains now for micropayments or something like that may not be a bad idea. Seems like a solid step up from a completely centralized micropayment platform. Not as good as Lightning, or the fully completed 2-way pegged sidechains though. But perhaps a solid interim plan if people are really concerned about micropayments in the short term.

That seems a little long considering that I thought a big part of the Classic argument was that it was going to either get 2MB out before segwit, or at the very least around the same time.
Since that doesn't look likely at all, Gavin should double down on his recent statement that he likes unlimited sized blocks, and make Classic about that. At least then it will be offering a real, tangible difference in technology.
Or just gracefully withdraw(best thing to do imo). But him and the other Classic backers seem pretty emotionally invested in this.

Just because something is logically possible doesn't make it likely. By that logic it's not impossible that Adam Back is a CIA operative who has been spending his life as a cypherpunk and academic as a cover so he can eventually infiltrate future currency systems that may or may not be invented 20 years down the line.
Something doesn't need to be proven in order to have little to no relative weight probability wise in your personal construction of what is likely to be the case. Anyone who looks objectively at the who, what, when, why, and how of Blockstream since their creation should easily be able to form a realistic opinion on who they are and what they are about. But people find it easier to get swept up in propaganda and conspiracy theories. That's just the sad reality we live in I guess.

Bitcoin has probably been in what most would have considered a 'failure state' for a while now. The only question is whether it can pull itself out one way or the other. Because go back in time and describe the current situation to anyone as a hypothetical, and I'm pretty sure that our current reality goes greatly against the set of conditions that people would have considered acceptable for Bitcoin to be considered a successful decentralized system.
Honestly though, it was easy for people to ignore the China situation because it at least appears that Chinese growth has been the driving factor in making a lot of people rich from Bitcoin. So I'm not even sure if people would do anything different. Or what exactly could have been done realistically.

What do you mean by this? That someone will create new sidechains with new genesis blocks based on those three technologies? That makes sense for ZeroCash and Monero since they're novel technologies that can add utility if recreated as a sidechain. But why would someone create a new sidechain based off Litecoin? If someone wanted a Bitcoin clone sidechain with faster blocks wouldn't it be better to fork the latest version of Bitcoin and just change the parameters themselves? 
Maybe I'm missing something and there's some hidden value in the Litecoin codebase that doesn't exist in Bitcoin's.

If it's a pool and people want the hard fork theoretically they should be able to pull their hash out and move somewhere else to make the hard fork happen.

@_date: 2016-01-24 16:23:13
I agree with what you said, but I also think there are important social considerations to make as well. Supporting the work of any developers by running their code is what will motivate them to continuing maintain and upgrade it. So it's quite meaningful what team you support, as even if the code alone can stand on its own, your choice still matters a lot.
Maybe it would be nice to have 10 dev teams all constantly working on their own consensus incompatible Bitcoin implementations, and each team works indefinitely whether or not people ever decide that their implementation should be the one used. But in reality it's hard enough to get one team of skilled, experienced developers who are compensated enough that they can work on Bitcoin full time. The ones whose work doesn't get chosen are not going to continue working in vain for nothing.

I'm worried the fallout will be worse than that and drive a lot of developers away from contributing to Core. Maybe you'll be right and they can compete against each other and be incentivized to merge in the blocksize increase from Classic.

Apparently Classic was announced without even consulting Core before hand. It seems more like a direct political attack to drive out certain people.

How does that solve the issue with spending BTC from known addresses at all?
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:47:14
Anyone can do anything they want and make their own implementation of Bitcoin that's not Core. And there are already many of those. But flexibility in the code when it comes to things that require consensus are a whole other can of worms. The option is always open to fork away from Core, but it's not something that should be taken lightly or based solely off emotional and political arguments.
When the technical and economic consensus is overhwelmingly in favor of supporting Core, then that should seriously cause people to think twice about what they're doing. And really the only reason that this whole thing is even an issue right now is because unfortunately Bitcoin's mining situation has not worked out as it was originally intended to, and we're stuck with dealing with the reality of someone like Jihan apparently controlling way too much of mining in general. From the silicon to the actual farms. It's a bad situation but at the end of the day the economic consensus will always determine the path that Bitcoin follows. So it's a big deal, but one way or the other Bitcoin will survive as the community has many different 'nuclear' defense mechanisms up its sleeve should they need to be used.

I don't think there's too much difference in terms of actual people between the two.
@_date: 2016-01-20 09:16:13


Sounds pretty logical to me though. What's the alternative?
If more miners drop off blocks can slow to the point where it will just continue to drive more miners off. It can easily get to the point where the next difficulty change is months away. This has happened in alts many times. What they would have to do is hard fork in a new difficulty adjustment method.
I'm not claiming to be an expert, but changing the PoW in this type of situation sounds like a good alternative.
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:34:59
The thing is that we can't really win against a nation-state that has sufficient resources. If they *really* want to take down Bitcoin they can build their own mining farms to attack. Even if we change the PoW algo it's not going to stop them, and would probably actually give them an advantage if there's a short window where general purpose computing and/or GPUs exist before new ASICs are fabricated.
So we should probably try to avoid antagonizing them too much if possible since it probably won't end well.

2MB blocks are probably fine. But now with segwit 2MB can effectively become ~4MB, 4MB can become 8MB and so on. So the question isn't really about 2MB blocks here, it's about the larger sizes.
Switching to another PoW would be pretty wild. Scheduled hard forks to switch PoW algos every 6 months or something like that would be interesting. It's never going to happen though.

In order to try to preserve that, but still try to satisfy the demand for improved information availability for outsiders, why not have the website perform the same function and be non-official? Where people involved with Core can still acknowledge the truth value of the information reported on there, but it's not presented as some kind of official centralized word for the project. This model also opens the door for multiple communication channels with similar methods of presenting information. As long as there's some way for contributors from the project to acknowledge the truth of the information being reported, or lack thereof, it could still result in a similar level of decentralization as before.
At the end of the day, the way I see it is the only official centralized word that the project can offer is the code that gets merged and then released. But people also desire easy access to true information, and as we can see now, the proliferation of false information has become an obvious problem I think judging my many of the untruths that have been flowing around the community for the last while. So far I think the Bitcoin Core website has been done well and added value. But I also see your concerns about having a centralized information source like that. So maybe instead of stopping there people can continue to think of ideas to both increase the flow of true information, while progressively moving back to a more decentralized model. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:14:51
Yes, I understand what payment channels are in a high level kind of way. But the way they function right now doesn't really add much utility. When you close the channel the transaction still gets pushed to the network. You might be able to group what would have been a larger amount of transactions in to a payment channel, but it's not some magical scaling solution. It might be able to work quite well for some uses like using a website ad free, or watching video online for fees. But there's still significantly more overhead with Bitcoin since things like blocksize, bandwitdh, blockchain size and storage all matter and are required to be kept within certain ranges to promote decentralization. There will be no such limitations with a bank backed blockchain(within reason of course, no one's dealing with petabytes anytime soon). 
And even if you tell me now that I'm out of touch, and people are working on payment channels to make them vastly better than what they have been, then if they are that useful for use with a blockchain, what's stopping R3CEV from using them on their blockchain? I mean shit, if I rememeber correctly Mike was the first one to implement payment channels in his bitcoinj. And since he's their technical lead there's no reason to think that they wouldn't integrate any sort of promising blockchain technology into their own chain.

Considering there are altcoins now that obviously aren't nearly the scale of Bitcoin where botnets aren't an issue, it's not as much of a threat as you might think. If anything, at scale people pointing botnets at a large network just adds some more hashrate, since even a very large botnet doesn't have the GPU power to really generate enough hash to mount a &gt;50% attack.
Yes, I agree that with PoW it always leads down the same path towards mining farms and ASICs. I don't think that can be helped at all unless you create some sort of situation where the PoW algo is being changed regularly enough that it doesn't make it economically viable to fabricate ASICs. Not saying that's some magic solution or anything. I don't really know.
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:49:43
Well, in reality the only time Bitcoin would change its PoW would be as a defensive measure against a hard fork from centralized mining.
Other than that it could be used as a short term measure to increase decentralization. But that's a pretty huge change that I think could only realistically be applied in a 'last resort' type of scenario like if Chinese miners started deciding they could push hard forks by themselves.

If BU and everyone that supports it could just fork off and go their own way that would probably work out better for Bitcoin in the long run. If they don't split off I fear we'll never get rid of this type of bullshit. I really don't want to be dealing with these idiots 5 or 10 years from now. It's gone on far too long and the users and economy are just screaming at them to fuck off already.

Well luckily the only assured destruction will be the hundreds of millions of dollars in SHA256 mining equipment that becomes the world's most expensive set of paperweights.
I think for the average Bitcoin user they probably won't notice much if things go smoothly.
It's kind of crazy that the miners(or at least Jihan) don't realize the most fundamental part of who really controls the power in Bitcoin. I can't even put into words how absurd it is that a single person is seriously trying to flex their power as some uber-miner that wants to control the network. Like did he forget what this whole thing is about?

I'm not really promoting anything, and I'm as flexible as anyone. I haven't even really had a position in this whole debate(although I seem to be tending towards the conservative side now obviously), but I don't think the question of whether larger block sizes will result in further centralization in China is a point that receives enough debate. The consequences are pretty major imo. 
There seem to be a fair amount of people who believe the opposite, that larger blocks will push some of the advantage back towards the international miners. And if that's true I think they should be more vocal with their arguments and make some posts on here, as if they're right the implications are big.

But as soon as it's revealed that a nation state successfully attacked Bitcoin it shatters the perception of security and censorship resistance. Sure, they can do the things that you describe, but an actual attack is more like a nuclear bomb. And the thing is even if we hard fork to another chain with a different PoW, once they've shown the willingness to spend those resources to attack there's no reason to believe they won't just do it again on the new PoW algo chain.

@_date: 2016-03-07 04:38:37


I was under the impression that the attack was a little more sophisticated than that and involved them abusing their position as the dominant miner. Rather than the site simply accepting 0 conf and getting double spent(which people have probably successfully done hundreds of times with no mining capability). That's the difference. If that's not the case and they didn't abuse their position as miners I can find a different example.

On a serious point, if fees do rise to a level where they interfere with smaller sized transactions what reason would they have not to integrate an alternative with lower fees?
The only reason I can think of not to do so is just plain old Bitcoin maximalism. But I kind of feel that they would even have some minor moral obligation to offer low fee alternatives. Just because there's a big part of the world where ordering things online for a few bucks online is surprisingly viable and common due to very cheap mail service. Chinese companies don't seem to have any problem with sending out something worth a buck or two. Check out Google Cardboard for an example. And memory is dirt cheap as well now. Five bucks can get you a decent size USB stick or microSD card.
If there's no Lightning Network or similar off chain transaction option for small transaction users, it's almost guaranteed that an alternative would be used, right?

I bet they had interest from multiple angles, if not direct offers.
You can't really say that them joining other companies sooner would have been the 'right thing' since it's not like they could see the future. I'm not really surprised that people like gmaxwell and sipa chose to keep their independence for a long time. I'm almost positive that they could have secured a position similar to Jeff's at Bitpay  at other Bitcoin companies if they wanted to.
Blockstream coming into play is something that's on a whole other level of potential. I'm not surprised it piqued their interest enough to decide to become co-founders. It's not comparable to taking a Lead Developer position at some well funded Bitcoin startup.
Also, consider the fact that if they had accepted job offers that would also cut down on their time spent developing Core. With Blockstream from what I understand it's explicitly stated in their contracts that their work on Core is allowed to take priority. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:35:46


Their statement is so ridiculous that I can't imagine what drove them to throw that gem in their demands list. As if Core is going to soft fork to something that's obviously dangerous.
It's almost like a complete non-statement that's meant as a political move or something for them to try to flex their muscles.

Ver said something along the lines of that he doesn't care if we turn Bitcoin into another Paypal now because if we need to we can always start over and make Bitcoin 3.0 or something like that. As in he has absolutely no concern or regard for the consequences of Bitcoin failing.
In theory, you'd expect supposed big holders like Ver to not act in this way. But yeah my experience in Bitcoin has completely taken a shit on everything I thought about markets and rationality.
Anyway, he said this quite a while ago too. So this isn't new information. And despite him being demonstrably reckless and destructive, the issue still festers today because well it seems a significant amount of people are batshit insane.
edit: michaelmx posted a link to the article with the quote but I'm going to paste the specific quote here because it's just too much: 


-Roger Ver
He completely takes for granted that Bitcoin as it is, the blockchain itself, can just become 'the default platform for people to transact on across the world'.
I think I remember that some the very first criticisms, even on the cypherpunk mailing list of all places, were that Bitcoin isn't inherently designed to scale like that in a decentralized manner. None of this is new information. Roger Ver makes up his own reality apparently. Pushed forward by ignorance without caring about the damage he causes.
@_date: 2016-01-10 06:44:00
Liquidity is fairly decent in places like the US and the UK/Europe. And of course China.
It's really bad in the places where there might be some potential of Bitcoin opening new markets though. Like some countries in Asia and Africa for example. 
The lack of liquidity in places make it all but unusable due to the high spreads. There are often times where Western Union is cheaper when all is said and done.
It's a solvable problem, but it would take a a committed effort by an organization that would have to (probably) forego immediate profits for long term market building. An organization that was committed to helping to build global liquidity would benefit everyone in the long run. There's already lots of boots on the ground in some of these parts of the world, but everyone has had to deal with the liquidity road block thus far.

We did it Reddit!
I'd like to thank:
Mike Toomim for getting blazed out of his mind and discrediting Bitcoin Classic.
Gavin Andresen for being honest and up front about his development intentions, and the fact that he had no plans to take up the lead role as he did in the past with Bitcoin. 
Jtoomim for quickly and unilaterally closing Luke Jr.'s PoW algo pull request on the Classic Github repo. It appears that his action there resulted in what might be called a mini-Streisand effect, bringing attention to both the idea that the PoW could be changed if necessary, and the general lack of process that exists with Classic. Not that there are any plans to change the PoW. Just the idea that it's one defense that can always be used if absolutely necessary.
And everyone else who seemed to quickly see through the reality that this was just a foolhardy political power-play designed to oust the group that has been responsible for all of the recent innovations in Bitcoin.
Hopefully from now on people will stop to think before letting their emotions drive their decisions. And consider that the people who have dedicated their life's work to the topics surrounding the technology behind Bitcoin might just be worth listening to when it comes to highly technical topics with many variables.

I'm sitting here trying to think up a reply but I can't get over the absurdity of this whole situation. I just keep picturing consider.it and the Toomin brothers and can't find the words to describe how ridiculous this whole situation is. 
On one hand it's pretty funny, on the other hand it's embarrassing for Bitcoin. And there are so many people in the community who really need to take a step back and take some time for some self reflection, and ask themselves just what they were thinking publicly supporting this thing. There's no substance to it at all. The entirety of what Classic was offering seems to be:
1. Hard fork Bitcoin and cut out Core.
2. Raise the block size to 2MB
3. ???(and this doesn't even begin to symbolize the apparent complete lack of any plan for the future)
4. Profit?
They're not even solving a problem by hard forking. There's nothing there. Cutting out the best developers in Bitcoin who already have a solid plan for scaling with multiple methods in development, and just trying to go for it on a 6 billion dollar project sounds like it was meant to be announced on April 1st rather than last week.
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:15:29


No, you don't understand. It's a conspiracy and Blockstream is going to intentionally inhibit Bitcoin's growth. Don't bring up facts like a large part of Blockstreamer's compensation is paid out in BTC on future dates. Everyone knows how awesome they are at developing Bitcoin and Bitcoin related technologies, so what we have to do is frame it in a way where despite their obvious technical superiority, they are executing an evil plan to harm the growth of Bitcoin. Because without that, none of our arguments against Core and Blockstream make any sense at all.
Without the demonization of Blockstream, we have nothing. So please stop derailing the propaganda machine so we can continue to recruit low information Bitcoiners and anyone who loves a good witch hunt.

I don't think the regulations are enforced as much as they could be. There seem to be a lot of tolerated tricks that people use. They're probably tolerated because they happen to be the same tricks that government officials use to get their own money out of China. But if it gets out of control then they might wake up and start enforcing the $50k USD yearly limit on personal funds exiting China.
For example, and I don't know if this is still possible or not, but people could go to Macau and purchase something worth a lot of money, say a diamond ring for $50k. They would use their Union Pay card which is like a debit card. So immediately after they purchase the item, they return it for cash minus a small percentage that the store keeps(they're in on it and making a commission).

I'm not sure what the current status is.

And I see him making posts on bitcointalk asking for advice on the situaton. So that's an example of someone they claim is on board, but is clearly not. So really the status right now is up in the air as far as I can tell.
Either way, I'm confident that anyone involved in the community on any sort of technical level, including miners, when given a full view of the situation, will not support a Classic hard fork. It's really a crazy and dangerous idea that really comes down to whether or not you believe that Core is genuine in its intention to scale Bitcoin.  And all the incentives are aligned for them to do the best they can for Bitcoin, and I think it's clear that they are doing so.

How much does OpenBazaar rely on low fees for Bitcoin transactions?
Is there any off chain method integrated that can get around paying transaction fees?
I think for the most part many people have accepted that at least for the next year or so, if Bitcoin gains more popularity, the average fees to get included in blocks in a timely manner may go up quite a bit. So if that happens, is there any specific plan from the OpenBazaar team on how to mitigate that issue? It could harm the UX as well as making smaller purchases uneconomical.

How many datacenters do you think it would take for it not to be trivially censorable by governments?
It's already arguably a failure decentralization wise to be honest considering the (super?)majority of the hashrate appears to be coming from China. Maybe not quite a failure yet, as myself and probably others would like to believe, but if someone were to tell me they weren't interested in Bitcoin because it's too centralized in China I'm not really sure I could honestly tell them that their concern is minor or invalid.
If we're going to build a system with a bunch of trusted entities running major datacenters and such, I don't really see the point of doing it this way. A federated cryptocurrency with a group of validators providing the same service but with no monetary base inflation, and no wasted energy on PoW, and instant confirmation seems like a better option. If you, and many others want this, and I don't even think it is necessarily bad at all, and potentially good if it were designed well with enough decentralization and reasonable governance, then people should pursue that and try to out compete Bitcoin as a digital payment method that's also programmable money where you own your own keys. 
Bitcoin, whether it works out or not, is just supposed to be different than that. Different type of consensus mechanism and different type of decentralization. Not necessarily better or worse, but very different. If there's truly demand for the datacenter type thing that's effectively a federated cryptocurrency, there's zero point in trying to turn an apple into an orange by attempting to make Bitcoin into that. If there's value in the idea, then great. People should pursue that option with all their might and make it a reality. Try get 500 or 1000 international data centers and trusted validators on board and with an inflationless and truly inherently deflationary currency unlike Bitcoin, instantly confirmed cryptocurrency that can fight Visa in transaction processing, you will have something that will be objectively impressive, despite what some Bitcoiners might say. It will be impressive, but different than Bitcoin. The two things are just not the same thing, but they are both valid ideas that deserve to compete in the open market if there's true demand for both.

I've been trying to say that this whole move is effectively a slap in the face to a large group of people who also happen to be the best Bitcoin experts(along with other relevant fields, like cryptography) in the world, and have contributed years of their lives and produced tons of solid work. A lot of people don't seem to see the subtext here, and how this move is specially designed to alienate people who are involved with Core. It's really blowing my mind that Bitcoin is playing out something like that would happen in US politics, character assassination, populist pandering, poisoning the well, all kinds of manipulation to really cloud the central issues. It's really sad.
Speaking of cryptography, do they have anyone on their dev team that specializes in that field? Their announced team was Gavin, Jeff, Peter R, jtoonim, and someone else who I can't remember off the top of my head. I think I can safely say that Gavin and Peter R aren't experts in cryptography. I'm not sure about Jeff or jtoonim. I recognize jtoomim from the sub here though.

No, the issue is that it is contentious. And if Chinese miners band together to start mining 2MB blocks then that chain is effectively Bitcoin China. And since continuing on the regular Bitcoin chain will be dangerous when something like an exahash of SHA-256 hash power is out there it would seem the only reasonable thing to do in the interest of security would be to change to something other than SHA-256.
Spite has nothing to do with it all. It's about what a decentralized cryptocurrency is and isn't.

I don't actually think you're wrong here in this discussion with what you're claiming, that LN can be integrated anywhere and there's nothing Bitcoin specific about the technology. And it seems weird that people are reacting to your post in this way considering the claim you made is pretty obviously true. There's no cryptocurrency technology that's ever going to be inherent to a single blockchain when everything is free and open source, and there's little barrier to entry.
I think you might have mistaken Electrum for an altcoin though up there. Not that it really matters.
But just because it's a payment layer above Bitcoin doesn't mean that it shouldn't be discussed here. Considering all the work right now is being done to implement it on top of Bitcoin specifically.
If someone started a thread about Litecoin implementing Lightning, and I don't see any reason why they wouldn't eventually do that, then I would agree that it wouldn't be appropriate for this sub.
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:26:32




That's if we knew for a fact larger blocks were going to accelerate centralization. I don't know if that's true, but there's a lot of people who know a lot more than I that think it will. Hopefully people will start making the other case and it will get some exposure on this sub. Also it's probably unlikely right now, but mining could change course and start spreading out again, which would mean even if that gives an advantage to Chinese miners there would be enough leeway to raise the block size anyway.
When it comes to potential damage from centralization, I'm not particularly worried about the actual miners themselves, more worried about the Chinese government.
As far as economic scenarios that could play out similar to what you mention, I agree that's a very real possibility. There are lots of ways this whole thing could play out, and some of those situations are going to be ones where growth is potentially hindered.
@_date: 2016-01-27 11:28:26


Part of the point of waiting and not committing to hard forking larger blocks is the fact that people are attempting to solve the scaling issues *without* having to do a hard fork. Why not let them try? It's not like there aren't multiple paths that are going to be rolled out and attempted.

Why did they choose to show Classic 0.12 vs Core 0.12? Wouldn't total Classic vs total Core be a much more accurate and relevant representation?
@_date: 2016-03-05 21:21:58
This sounds about right to me. But the Bitcoin community has mislead people and called anyone questioning Bitcoin's ability to scale a troll and/or FUD'er since 2011 too. So it wasn't just a 2013/2014 VC money party thing. That probably just magnified the problem.

Hyperledger, r3CEV, ect aren't a threat because they appear to be doing something completely different than what Bitcoin is doing.

Core doesn't hold a monopoly on Bitcoin implementations. There are many. 
Don't confuse that with software designed to hard fork the blockchain. There's only one set of consensus rules that are going to work at a time on a single blockchain. So in that sense you can call a consensus a 'monopoly' if you really want to stretch the meaning, but that's a bit silly.
Plus anyone at anytime can modify any Bitcoin implementation to different consensus parameters and hard fork. But people actually have to build off of that chain if they want it to actually function. There's no monopoly, no restriction on doing so.
@_date: 2016-03-11 19:01:19
Honest question, if there are all these experts here that are able to shoot down ideas like this in minutes with a quick glance, and they actually turn out to be correct, does it give you any reservation at all about Classic taking over Bitcoin development?

Even though wikileaks seems to have a lot of very interesting information, I'm scared to even visit the site, let alone download any documents. Maybe a bit too paranoid though(something something hornet's nest). I guess I'll just read the summary articles like with some of the Snowden stuff.

Well, I'm definitely all for listening to what he has to say about the whole situation. It may very well be that people took something he said out of context and have led us to believe that he was more involved in Classic than he actually was.
On the other hand, if he really did volunteer to be one of the main developers for Classic, I really have to question his judgement. I actually think his name alone was the catalyst for Classic gaining the apparent traction it did. Gavin had already 'gone rogue' in a sense with XT, so if Classic just had his name on it I really don't think so many people in the industry would have been as willing to back it. Garzik though has always appeared fairly neutral, so seeing his name on that developer list for Classic was kind of a big deal.
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:00:45


I'm pretty sure this is the only reason that Classic is even being discussed right now. He's the only person on that list with any real credibility.
Although I also think it's fair to say that him joining Classic is sufficient reason to doubt his judgement. I was quite surprised to see his name on that list. He had always seemed to stay fairly neutral.

Yes, of course. None of these projects have ever mentioned or intended to use cryptocurrency. That would be a very aggressive move against existing governments and central banks.
This seems to be a wide misconception in the Bitcoin community. They don't want to make their own money. What they are interested in is decentralized(maybe)/distributed, cryptographically secure, immutable(maybe to some extent, maybe not), permissioned ledgers.

Is it really that much easier if there are no ASICs? It depends on the size of the network. But in both cases it comes to down a dollar amount of hashing you would need to buy/rent. It's not like SHA256 ASICs are hard to come by. Or design even(for the NSA at least).

But I've done a few of these online courses that are open to the public, and I haven't encountered one yet where the students would be required to purchase materials. Since the courses are generally constructed to reach a wide range of people worldwide.
I wonder if this course will do something similar and offer alternatives to purchasing the device. That's what I had expected when I first saw it announced.

Jihan Wu is the poster boy for short term thinking trying to squeeze out pennies now at the cost of dollars in the future. Him mining empty blocks and his childish response of what was basically a Cartmanesque "I do what I want!" illustrated that a long time ago. 
And now we get to further watch him knock billions off the market cap by continuing to act in a way that at least appears to be pretty stupid. Maybe he thinks he's playing some clever game, or maybe he's being fed money or something, but either way it's horrible for the long term prospects of Bitcoin to have this guy basically spell it out with giant flashing letters that the Bitcoin experiment is not going as it was hoped to.
Hopefully it will work out and Jihan can become the poster boy of what not to do as a Bitcoin miner for future participants.

Clams are pretty unique and I think it's a bit of a stretch to even include them in the article imo. Not that he presented them as a great example or anything. But I get what he meant with using a snap shot of the blockchain at a certain date and people who had addresses with funds on them at the time can claim some money. It's just very different. 
A better example might have been Feathercoin branching off from Litecoin. But I didn't pay attention to that at the time, so I don't know the details of now it went. But I was told that FTC actually hard forked off from the LTC blockchain with new consensus rules(1 min blocks I think?). I was pretty surprised to learn about that(assuming that's an accurate description of what happened). I've always seen alts start their own blockchain with their own genesis block.
Maybe someone who remembers can tell us how it went down. Seems like an odd choice to me.

I haven't observed Jihan as many years as I have Roger, since Roger has been around since at least 2010 if not before. But I think it's pretty clear that they would both benefit from professional help.
They're both quite different though. Whereas I think Roger truly believes what he is doing is the right thing to do, while I don't think Jihan cares or even makes any distinction between right and wrong.
I wouldn't say they're 'mentally impaired', but the beliefs that they hold to justify their actions are absolutely delusional and suggest that they are having trouble separating reality and imagined conspiracies.
I'm not a mental health professional, so I'm not sitting here trying to make a diagnosis. But I think anyone who has followed this thing long enough would find it hard to deny the various signs indicating potential personality disorders that are likely making a bad situation worse.
At the very least, with so much at stake here I don't see why anyone on any side would think it at a bad idea to at least check with a professional. It's not uncommon at all for people to have issues. And then add on the stress and high stakes that are involved here and it's easy to see how things can get compounded.

You're wrong. The minority chain could switch PoW algos and there would be lots of people happy to dump massive amounts of BTC on the Chinese miner chain. Staying on the Chinese miner chain would be such an obvious failure of Bitcoin that it's almost certain that the chain that ends up as the SHA-256 minority chain for a short period of time before a PoW change will emerge as the economically superior chain.
Only thing that could save the Chinese miner chain is if they somehow convinced massive numbers of people in China who aren't really able to follow what's really happening in the Bitcoin world, and they continue to transact on the China chain. That could make it it viable for them, but everyone else would be with the Core chain.

The thing is too that this is just their latest effort in a desperate attempt to grab whatever power they can. They failed twice already with XT and Classic. So now the plan is to sell it all out as an offering to the miners, as they see this as the only realistic path to power. The users and the economy aren't with them, but they figure if they can pull this off they'll settle for giving miners ultimate power and being their underlings.
Anyone who seriously supports BU needs to wake the fuck up already. Reexamine everything from the ground up. 
Regardless of what you think of blocksizes and such, who in their right mind would want to give Jihan any more power than he already has? The guy is not a good guy. And even if he was why would you want to give him even more power than he has now? And the amount he has now is *way* too much already.

I don't know the answer to this, but my guess is it's something that's possible. But it also sounds like something that would be trivial for them to work around by relaying blocks through an international proxy or something. They would probably get more orphans with the additional time it would take to relay their blocks though if they need to do this.
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:25:11
Yep, definitely. RBF or not 0-conf was never meant to be secure. And if blocks get more crowded it will just make it easier to double spend 0-conf by intentionally using a fee that you know is unlikely to get included in the blocks by miners. Actually doesn't even have to be technically a double spend, it could always just time out and get dropped from peoples mempools.

It seems many people are expecting Open Bazaar to be something that's going to allow censorship resistant darkmarkets to exist so that people will be free to sell anything. But the reality is far from that. 
Also apparently anyone who wants to have a store on OB has to act as their own server and keep their computer on. Which sounds like a really weird design choice to me.
All that and it's not connected to the web at all, so regular people who want to shop will have to find, download, and install a separate app. That's quite difficult to do these days. Not impossible, but quite the marketing challenge.
I have nothing against OB at all, and I hope it is successful. But people on his sub have been telling me for what seems like close to a couple of years now that OB is the absolute killer app for Bitcoin and it's going to take it to the next level. And that seems to be a common opinion. But that opinion seems to be based on the idea that OB will usher in a new revolution in freedom to sell contraband, where as in reality it's not designed to do that at all. Which is fine, and the creators are smart not to support that stuff, but people need to stop building it up to be something its not.

@_date: 2016-01-27 11:38:10


I don't want to really get in to it here, but part of the problem as I see is that this isn't true at all. And many people just want what they believe will maximize the short term value of their BTC. And that's a major part of the issue here. Short term vs long term health of Bitcoin.
People referencing the 'Fidelity effect' are a perfect example of this. They appear to be willing to essentially allow Bitcoin to turn into some bloated corporate distributed database rather than the p2p money that I believe is clearly a more healthy long term goal. Things like that might get you some short term pump so you can go buy yourself a new TV or something, but it's also defining Bitcoin as something that puts the blockchain knee-deep in a tragedy of the commons situation. The fact that Patrick Byrne didn't use Bitcoin for his own database style projects is not a bad thing at all. People should rightfully be resisting the blockchain as a distributed database service attempts. It shouldn't be so cheap and easy to bloat the ever growing blockchain. It's an important resource.
@_date: 2016-01-14 20:09:48
Yeah, that sounds promising. I just find it kind of crazy how many people have been hyping OB up over the past long while now as if it's going to be a game changer for darkmarkets.
I understand why so many people think that, since from what I remember it was originally something Amir Taaki cooked up at a hackathon or something. But it's just so far from what it orginially was now from what I understand. And that's ok, there's nothing wrong with them not wanting to be the creators of the next Silk Road. And I don't blame them at all really. But there's just been so much hype around it, where people a literally thinking that it will set off another Bitcoin bubble and such. But all of that hype seems to be based off of a false premise. 
I do hope it can be successful at what they've set out to do with the regular consumer market place though. Any sort of traction there would be nice.

This seems like an absolutely critical point that people have been trying to get across for probably over 6 months now, but very few people seem to have grasped it.
I'm almost getting the impression that the whole debate is one side who thinks raising block size will lead towards mining being re-decentralized globally due to more orphans for China because of the Great Firewall slowing them down. And the other side predicting that mining will continue to be centralized in China *because* the majority of hash is already behind the GFW, thus the network is psuedo-segregated in a way that promotes Chinese miners to be building off each others blocks, since outside blocks that are now larger will be taking longer to enter China past the GFW. 
This is such a big issue it seems, but I feel like I'm living in crazyland because it doesn't seem to be a very prominent point of debate.

Lots of different ones out there in alt land already. edit: I think I see that it's Keccak, which is kind of what I expected since I believe it won the competition to become 'SHA-3' at NIST.

Jihan is a bad actor. Has no regard for long term success for Bitcoin and foolishly tries to maximize his own short term profits at everyone's expense, including his own eventually.

Some may quit, I don't know. But I think a lot of people would continue to work on the chain that has the old parameters, and I wouldn't consider that quitting. You could make the argument that after a successful Classic hard fork where the minority chain was forced to change PoW that they're no longer working on the Bitcoin chain I guess. It's a bit different though imo.
I wouldn't really fault anyone for quitting if they chose that personally. If you worked on a project and it was superseded by another one that you disagreed with, and you wanted to move on to something else, I don't think that would confirm anything really negative about anyone. But I think the better choice would be to work on the new PoW chain. But that's my biased perspective because I think there would still be some solid potential for value and growth there.

You don't want to know. Just turn back now while you still have your sanity. 
Unless you happen to own a bunch of BTC, in which case I guess the first thing you should read is this: 
After that I'm not sure what to link you specifically but search for Bitcoin Classic. People including Gavin and Jeff are trying to hard fork Bitcoin away from Core.

Part of me is having trouble coming to terms with him being this stupid. I mean it obviously seems that way, but is there something more to it? Is he intentionally being obtuse because he's gaining elsewhere? 
It's just hard to reconcile the fact that someone apparently this idiotic has managed to find themselves in such a big position of power in Bitcoin. Only thing I can think of is that Roger or someone is personally giving him money and he's just playing it up for now to squeeze them dry. But we're talking about someone who has a massive investment in mining. So the amounts that you'd imagine to be sufficient for him to take such obviously harmful steps seem unlikely...
I'm not much of a conspiracy person at all. And I guess the most likely explanation is just that he's clueless. But still, it's just ridiculous how irrational this guy seems. He takes the basic assumption about Bitcoin security and miners acting rationally in their own self interest and takes a giant shit all over it.

It's called money. A handful of people made wealthy via Bitcoin happen to have lost the plot and have decided to leverage their wealth against Bitcoin. It's not really that surprising that so many people have been manipulated when you're you're dealing with millionaires. People in general are susceptible to this type of thing, particularly fearmongering.
I don't know who's doing what now, but at least Classic publicly had Ver and Janssens. Both of whom made a lot of money off investments in BTC. Both also who seem to have mental health issues.
Jihan Wu is probably extremely wealthy now too, and he seems like someone with very questionable reasoning skills, prone to emotional arguments.

I remember hearing the names and about the patents way back. Like 2011 or so. It was always curious, but I don't remember there being anything else to go on. It probably doesn't get brought up much because there's not much to discuss about it I guess.
edit: This was also around the time some magazine did one of the first major investigations about Satoshi's identity and mainly targeted a group of students and researchers at Trinity in Dublin. I don't remember too many of the details though. But I think the patent may have been mentioned in the article. But it was almost certainly brought up beforehand on Bitcointalk at some point(or perhaps bitcoin.org when it hosted the message board).

Well things worked out for Linux. Maybe most people don't have any idea what Linux is, but a billion of them are using Android which is built on the kernel.
It's possible that things could go a similar way in the future for Bitcoin. With consumer facing layers where there's no need or reason for users to know or care that Bitcoin is used at some lower level.

It will end up effectively being a permissioned blockchain whether they realize it or not. Some people that I've discussed it with apparently fully realize that and have no qualms. Others seem to be under the delusion that taking these sorts of actions doesn't fundamentally change their blockchain into a sort of permissioned mutable chain.
I hope that at the very least everyone knows exactly what their doing by accepting a consensus altering fork.
If they do it, personally I recommend a large pivot towards the permissioned blockchain market. Drop all the unnecessary technical overhead and embrace the new normal. There's lots of bank money out there for them to get too. So if they're going to do it, might as well not half ass it and try to keep a facade of still being what it was before.

No one I've asked has ever given me an answer on how Ethereum is going to scale. From what I can tell it faces much larger scaling issues than Bitcoin does.

Well that's kinda my point. It's an open source project, so anything relevant just gets posted here pretty quickly.

I agree. This needs to end once and for all even if it means a split.
I was very much against a split for a long time. But this is never going to end otherwise. It's been far too long already. And they don't even set activation deadlines like they used to so at least there would be a small breather before they came out with the next attack.

I think it's more likely that people would just make some large percentage of his coins unspendable. Like 80-90% or something to offset the massive size of his stash.
Actually taking his coins doesn't really make sense, but lowering the supply and mitigating the risk from having someone having the ability to wipe out the economy if they wanted to might get some interest. 
Not saying I necessarily support doing something like that, but like the emission schedule issue, if people think it's in their best economic interest to do something like that they will. If the fallout from doing it is less than the amount gained by reducing the supply, I'd expect people to try to make it happen at some point.

Given slock.it's intention and writings on what they were meaning to create with the DAO, I don't think it's nearly as clear as you're making it out to be.

Especially considering how nothing like this has ever happened before. These types of things set precedents in law.

@_date: 2016-06-04 14:08:06
It's one thing to have a positive opinion related to a small blocksize increase at some point if it's safe and feasible. Lots of people are probably fine with that if it makes sense from a technical perspective.
It's an entirely different thing to support a catastrophe like Classic was. I think a decent amount of people are probably feeling a bit embarrassed now for letting their emotions get the better of them and getting behind it. But I think a lot of people have hopefully learned a valuable lesson and the community will become more resistant to that type of political scheme, and all of the manipulation that came with it.
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:21:59
That's a very self centered view of the issue.

Yeah that's pretty much it. Which is why people who have been pushing for Bitcoin consumer transactions have been wasting a lot of time and money. It's not even remotely close for that class of transactions. Credit cards are a much better proposition in almost all cases.
FWIW, 2014 was really the year when people tried to push Bitcoin for consumers hard, and that obsession has pretty much fizzled out at this point.

@_date: 2016-06-02 11:22:37
Because it was common for wallets to have hard coded fees back then. Electrum had it set to 0.0002 for the longest time. I actually got so fed up I changed the code to set it to something more reasonable. But if you look at how many default fees of 0.0001-0.0002 were being sent around in 2013 you'll see that a huge amount of people were just stuck paying them. 
I remember seeing a chart and it's funny how much higher the average fee was back then in USD.

How could you even begin to think that was ever realistic when every transaction gets included in the blockchain? Convert some percentage of all daily cash transactions to on chain Bitcoin transactions and the blockchain would explode in size. We'd be talking petabytes in no time.
Bitcoin solves some problems, but cheap p2p microtransactions were never going to work in the first place. Even Satoshi said that himself. And he probably had some rose colored glasses on back then thinking about how Bitcoin could potentially scale. At that point it was just spitballing anyway, so not a big deal that he was overly optimistic. But at least he knew that it wasn't going to work for massive amounts of microtransactions, like the type that occur en masse everyday around the world.

I don't understand how so many people even begun to believe that Bitcoin was going to be running a blockchain sized in petabytes anytime soon.

Even Satoshi said it himself, and I know how many people love to pull out old Satoshi quotes to support whatever they 'feel' is the way Bitcoin should be regardless of reality and technical constraints.

If the intention was for the code to be 'law', then it's not 'illegal'.

@_date: 2016-06-25 11:21:48
Eight months ago it seemed a large amount of people didn't know who Wladimir was either, and still thought that Gavin was the lead maintainer. 
Which incidentally is one of the reasons I think a lot of people listened to Gavin's blog posts in the beginning. They mistakenly thought that he was still active(and relevant I guess*) in Bitcoin development.
*He could have remained relevant I'm sure if he decided to continue to work on the day to day grind work that keeps everything plugging along. Rather than creating his own position as some 'Chief Scientist' theory guy.

I'm sorry but the harsh reality is that these sorts of changes are possible with blockchain technology.

@_date: 2016-06-20 14:45:14
It's not the same thing. The DAO is a level above the protocol itself, and the DAO was designed and written by people, and those people made a large error. Many other smart contracts have failed to uphold the spirit of which they were written, albeit on a much smaller scale. The only reason that anyone is even considering a fork that affects where and who owns the ETH related to the DAO is simply because of the amount involved. 
The way you phrase it makes it sound like Ethereum was designed in a way where subjective judgements by humans to determine the results of smart contracts was part of the plan all along. Whereas you know as well as I do that it was not. 
And what happened with Bitcoin in 2010 was far beyond something that "violated the spirit of that system". It was a complete technical failure at the lowest level. Ethereum itself absolutely has not failed in the same manner. The situations are not similar.
@_date: 2016-06-10 08:42:40

@_date: 2016-01-17 14:55:23
No, claiming anyone who likes to listen to experts to help establish their views on a subject is making a logical fallacy is the new trend here.
I assumed they picked it up after people were pointing out that basing your argument on a vague idea of what they think Satoshi envisioned and what he may have thought true at the time is an actual appeal to authority. So this is people trying to turn the tables, except they just make themselves look more clueless.
Also the fact that OP in this particular thread made no claims and just suggested people listen to what Bram is saying doesn't matter. Everything that doesn't mesh with what they think is a logical fallacy.
@_date: 2016-01-26 20:17:18
I was thinking about it in more of a 'free market' sense. Assuming that reputation and trust is a highly valued thing, and when that's lost the market reacts to exclude people who don't provide value, or provide negative value even.
I always kind of assumed that in a situation with no authority and a culture of non-violence that exile is the only way to deal with those who do harm. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. It just seems to follow logically.
Maybe I see what you would consider discussing ideas as something more nefarious and potentially very damaging(edit: because this sounds wrong, but I have nothing against discussion and I'm against censorship). I would expect that putting ones reputation on the line and attempting something that is indirectly attacking an existing structure and the people included would result in consequences to ones reputation. And subsequently ones further participation, inclusion, and acknowledgement by others. But I also realize that from what I can tell reputations in this community don't really matter as much as one might expect in a system with no authority. I don't know why that is though.
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:28:51
I highly, highly doubt that. As someone who's followed Bitcoin for a long time and watched these schisms develop, it all follows a narrative that stretches back years. And the major players are people who've been involved from the start. Unless you think Mike and Gavin are some sort of government agents(I don't, some people do), or that people like Greg are(zero chance imo) are, then other than that there's really nothing to indicate any sort of intentional inciting of discord.
The most you could really claim is that some agency is paying people to create new accounts with unknown backstories to add fuel to the fire. And again, I highly doubt that. But with something like that there's no real way to prove it either way, so I'm sure many people will go on believing that's what's happening. People in this community *always* like to use the narrative of them being targeted and in the middle of a giant conspiracy with the prize of the global financial system at stake. That's one thing that's probably never going to change since it probably gives people a tingling feeling in their balls when they imagine it.

Yes, that's a good way to describe it and I'm surprised that this is the first time I've read someone bring up the p-word.

Comendeer all the mining farms, seize the exchanges and the money that's on them, make Bitcoin explicitly illegal to start. 
We would of course fight back against the government's new mining centralization/possible attack by forking to a new PoW. But considering how much of the mining and trade volume of Bitcoin is located in China now it would just be an utter disaster and huge mess. Much money would be lost.

Classic was over as soon as everyone saw that their so-called "overwhelming consensus" and big list of miners who "supported" them was complete fiction. And that was like late-Jan early-Feb. It was a good try though. Luckily enough people saw through their bullshit to stop that attempted steamroll into a hard fork 28 days later strategy right in its tracks.
After that it was just a big time wasting distraction rather than something that ever had any chance of being accepted. They did manage to string along a lot of people though with stunts like blowing money on renting a bunch of McNodes. Not sure how anyone thought one person running a shitton of nodes would help them. Last I heard some suspected the node plan was really a "Blockstream Core" operation to discredit Classic lol...The whole thing would be funny if it wasn't actually causing real harm to the communities productivity and wasting some ridiculous figure in manhours.

Reading this post makes me think you're American. Because outside of the US, in Asia and Europe at least, there has been some progression. Instant p2p free domestic transfers is common, even between banks. SEPA, while not instant, is still a maximum of 1 business day across borders, which is a solid improvement over traditional wires. Chip and PIN type stuff for more security too on cards.
It's the American banking system that's been frozen in the 90s/early 00s for the most part. Not that international banks are blowing people's minds with some amazing innovative tech or anything, but some progress has been made at least.

Well I agree with you in the sense that I don't agree with any such comments being made in a mean spirited manner or clearly meant to be a personal attack - which I'd agree this one probably was and so I don't condone.

Not on this planet.
Bitcoin will survive, but would be a shell of its former self. China could probably do more damage than the US given the market size and amount of physical hash power that's there. But the US could really crush it economically if the government had to will to do so. And the Streisand effect for something that's already pretty well known amongst those capable of using it without trusting a third party is going to be minimal at best. Especially with a patented dose of fear and propaganda that governments seem to be quite good at.

Blacklisting transactions would imply that the 184 billion BTC block still existed on the blockchain and there was some sort of code blacklisting that coinbase output or something like that. As opposed to it being an invalid block and the blockchain continuing on from the previous block(edit: not automatically or anything, manual intervention was required. just to clarify).
If there was a similar failure of the Ethereum protocol then I don't think anyone would be arguing about abandoning the block where it started and restarting from the previous one. But in this case Ethereum didn't fail at all, only the DAO smart contract did. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:32:48
They have high bandwidth to each other. Which is why the larger blocks are(ones that have to cross out and over the GFW) the greater centralization pressure grows within China.

He's someone who's not stupid, but seems to have some kind of cognitive bias that leads him towards at least two very major important positions that many would consider wrong and/or unwise. The fact that he's otherwise a reasonable and smart person means that it's also likely that him publically and prolifically holding such positions influenced a number of people. For quite a while he was by far the most prolific pro-big block discusser in this forum. So it's not really that odd when we're discussing potentially life changing issues for people here. As much as it can be avoided making it any kind of personal issue, sometimes pointing such things out is relevant.
There really have been a significant amount of Bitcoiners who have completely gone off the rails the past year and a half or so. To me, it has nothing to do with sewseo as a person at all, it's more about all the people who have been influenced by him and others. I don't think he's stupid, I don't think he's malicious, I just think he's generally been wrong but also his posts have probably been influential enough that they may have helped shape quite a few people's worldview on Bitcoin. And as time goes on maybe it's important to try to point things out in a way that doesn't target the person, but rather point out that maybe these ideas that have propagated so widely in the Bitcoin community need to be thrown out already so we can move on. I mean, he already moved on himself.

That's just how reddit works. It's intended to work in a way where regular people who aren't involved with the site come across its content and submit it because they think it's interesting. Domains that are obviously self promoting to an excessive amount get put on a list.
Seems like your issue is with the way reddit is meant to be run rather than and its mods. Like Bashco said, the mods have to go out of their way to approve posts that are relevant content for the sub because a lot of stuff just gets auto-blocked by reddit.

From the start I was talking about consensus within the technical community, not the wider community.

@_date: 2016-01-16 18:04:05
Well avoiding meaningful debate and conversation certainly is not my intention.
It seems reckless to me to make a political move like this that will cut out so many valuable contributors. I'd be surprised if many of people involved with Core didn't view it as a personal attack.
Greg Maxwell apparently stepped down from Core recently as you know, and one of the IRC logs posted showed him saying that he was sick of Gavin making backroom deals, and the adversarial approach rather than collaboration. This appears to be exactly the type of thing that drove him away.
I don't really understand what's driving people to want to switch. Some people seem to have the idea that Core has no plans to increase the capacity of Bitcoin, but obviously that's not the case at all. This will probably just result in a lot of technical talent moving on to other projects.
As a side node related to meaningful debate in this sub, I think that it's possible that not being allowed to discuss it in this sub is part of what's driving people to support Classic. Not saying that it's a fact, but there's no question that the policy in this sub has pissed a lot of people off. Maybe it seems more sudden since posts related to Classic are being deleted in line with Theymos' policy.

No, I'm not talking about wallets. I'm talking about completely separate implementations other than Bitcoin Core. Including recreating the essential consensus parts. 
The protocol is just that. It does not rely on Bitcoin Core's implementation to function at all. As long as you're creating valid blocks and your node is relaying valid transactions there's nothing stopping anyone from writing their own software. And there have been and are many different implementations in many different languages.
Consensus is an entirely different thing altogether. Obviously blocks and transactions need to be valid to be built on or used by the network. And if you want something different it's up to you to convince enough people to join your fork.

I'm positive that this is a categorically false statement. It's so incredibly general and unspecific that even though I'm not a lawyer, I can virtually guarantee that no law in the modern world would ever have anything close to a statement like that included in it.

I don't know if the rule has been updated or changed, but for a long time reddit had a pretty strict rule about the ratio of self promotion posts to regular contributions allowed. I want to say it was 10%:90%, but not sure.

Botnets are pretty over rated when you're talking about something as large as Bitcoin.
For small alts, yes they can be a big factor. But I remember seeing some numbers about the amount of actual hash botnets of various sizes with algos meant for general purpose processing and it's not as much of a factor as one might expect when you're talking about a network with serious scale like Bitcoin. Specialized farms, even if they end up as CPU or GPU farms, will still dominate from what I understand. 
Maybe the NSA or something has some sleeper botnet with tens of millions of devices waiting to be turned into zombies, but realistically existing known botnets are probably more profitably used for internet marketing type stuff or the ole renting them out for DDoS thing.
This is all old info pieced together from various debates and online discussions though, so if someone thinks it's wrong or out of date feel free to correct me on the modern nature of botnet mining.

I've been saying forever that it's not cool that Bitcoin mining is centralized in a authoritarian state. The type of state that makes VPNs illegal. The whole mining scene in China exists at the whims of the party. If they wanted to step in and nationalize it, or just shut most of them down, they easily could. They just shut down over 100 *golf* courses because it's a game that projects wealth. If they're going after what they perceive as 'excess' then Bitcoin mining is an easy target. Not to mention the whole capital controls thing...
@_date: 2017-01-24 14:35:50
Shutting it down would be better than the government coopting the mining for itself and controlling it. It could be a good thing in the long run maybe though, yeah. Doesn't really matter either way since we can just change the algo to something else if necessary. 
It's not good that at a basic level the model seems to favor centralization like this, but whatever it's worked so far and it's not like there are any easy answers or solutions out there.
@_date: 2016-11-28 15:47:42
It can take a lot longer than two weeks if an attacker or some other situation results in a big drop in hashing right after the difficulty adjustment. 2016 blocks at 10 minute target difficulty based on the last set of 2016 blocks which were mined with a lot more hashpower could take months if there is a big enough disparity.
It could always be manually adjusted I guess, but that would be something I'm sure everyone would want to very much avoid.

But for Bitcoin the technology to work as you seem to want it to it needs companies exactly like Stripe to wrap it all up in a pleasant user experience.
Realistically most people aren't going to be using Bitcoin on any sort of lower level. Even with solid mobile and desktop wallet apps, the responsibility to hold and protect your own money is one many people even here in our community of long time users and enthusiasts struggle with. So banks and financial service providers are unlikely to ever go away in my opinion. Hopefully they continue to adopt Bitcoin and offer it in a user friendly manner to their customers though. Stripe actually is on board with Bitcoin if I remember correctly, so it's actually pretty good.

It's been going on for far too long now and it's getting ridiculous. You'd think maybe he'd stop after the shitshow that was XT, and then Classic, but no.

Actually right now I'd say one of the most realistic dangers to Bitcoin's success right now would be a Trump presidency in where he tries to 'make Mexico pay' through capital controls on them remitting money. Of course Bitcoin would be a good way around that. But if it actually becomes a successful way for Mexicans in the US to send back any chunk of the large amount of money that gets remitted back there, and it gets on Trump's radar, then the US government coming out against Bitcoin would be one of the worst possible situations. 
So far, as far as government tolerance of Bitcoin goes, things have been good. Maybe too good even. It's actually kind of amazing how little resistance there's been so far. But Trump is definitely the type to fight against anything he thinks undermines his power. And if someone tells him that the Mexican's are getting past his capital controls though this mysterious technology he'll try fight it. He doesn't need to understand it, and he won't care. He'll say something like 'People are telling me that this Bitcoin is funding pedophiles with their child porn online, and your kids are using it to buy heroin and meth on the internet' and that's pretty much the type of rhetoric he'll shovel to justify pushing anti-Bitcoin policy.
I mean he's probably not going to get elected from what I can tell based on the markets and such. So it probably won't matter. And it's not like Hillary couldn't go anti-Bitcoin for whatever reason, I'm sure she could too. It's just that the whole Mexican capital controls thing is a very plausible scenario for Trump specifically since he's already made statements at least implying that he'd try to implement things like that.

These days anything is politically defensible. Just make a fuss about whatever fear mongering buzzwords are popular like terrorism or child porn. Bitcoin is an easy target.

I wish it was simply over .3MB and was primarily a technical debate. But it's not and it never has been over the last year and a half or so. It's all politics and agendas while Core as a project continues to act as a large productive group of people from all over the world making open source software.
For anyone that believed that Classic was really just about getting 2MB to avoid some so-called crash landing that never happened, I suspect a good amount of you with an ounce of sense can see through them now that the effort is to block Segwit which is on-chain scaling(apparently what they wanted before).

Yes, it's definitely worth looking at again. I tried to explain to the apparently many people on the Ethereum sub what exactly they're getting themselves into here by choosing any kind of fork that touches people's money. But what is really going to be interesting, is how the market reaction plays out if/when they actually fork. If it doesn't immediately tank or something similar(and it won't necessarily do so, but it probably should/will in the long run if they do fork), I can imagine people using that as an argument towards taking similar actions in the future with Bitcoin.

The idea that it's disposable and that we're going to have the luxury of a 'redo' is very optimistic.

Are they not? btcd, nbitcoin and other consensus compatible implementations are independent are they not? Didn't Coinbase write their own implementation in Ruby way back in the day too? I think there have been tons of different implementations. Some didn't pan out, but lots of people took the challenge I think. Creating and maintaining an implementation is a lot of work though it would seem. 
Most people would just recommend running Bitcoin Core. But anyone can certainly run any implementation they wish and it's always been like that.

I don't use the Circle app, but if I did and they stopped allowing me to purchase BTC(which is what I presume is exactly what most here would be using it for), wouldn't that entirely justify a one star review? 
If Uber stopped allowing me to order rides I'd probably give them one star and feel justified. Is that immature, or just proper usage of the rating system? 
I honestly don't see why giving the app one star now would be petty or unjustified, but maybe I'm missing something here.

If we were to be perfectly intellectually honest, and someone posed this scenario as a hypothetical to everyone a few years ago, realistically most people would probably consider Bitcoin a failure with these conditions. 
At one point we had 50k nodes and anyone could order one or a few Radeons and mine at home. Sure there were big pools and that was still a problem, but it was *far* more decentralized. I don't think Satoshi really foresaw how things would progress, nor would he likely have a solution for the problem(I think, I don't know).

If China or the US 'banned' Bitcoin or something they would lower the demand for BTC. Right now it's very easy for Americans and Chinese to buy BTC, and it's apparently somewhat easy to operate Bitcoin businesses in those countries. If that were to change it would likely relegate Bitcoin to being a niche currency and put a big limit on its growth potential. 
And China or the US actually putting in resources to at least try to stop Bitcoin, or hinder it would be even worse. A war on Bitcoin would cripple it economically speaking. And even though it should technically survive, it will just be a shell of what it is/could be run by some enthusiasts doing it for ideological reasons.
Since Bitcoin's money supply is inherently inflationary, constant demand from fiat is needed to flow in. And the US and China are the two most important gateways that allow that demand to be met.

What if it impacts their ability to manage their own currency and economy? You say it like it's a no brainer that they'll be able to make more money off hosting Bitcoin mining farms, but that doesn't seem evident to me at all. They can tax it, or they can nationalize it, but they can easily be losing vastly more money via outflows then they can be gaining off some Bitcoin mining tax. And obviously nationalizing mining is effectively just them starting their own alt chain since no one here is going to bother with that garbage.
I don't see natural resources as analogous since those are just things of value that are sitting there already owned and waiting to be extracted. Where as Bitcoin mining is nothing like that at all.
China is and will remain a *huge* risk for Bitcoin as long as so much of the Bitcoin mining and economy goes on within their borders. Mining wise people damn well better be ready and prepared to switch to a new PoW on a very quick schedule should the government decide to make a move. In fact there should be some pre agreed plan on exactly what should trigger that and the steps that need to be taken by the community as a whole to minimize disruption during the hard fork.
@_date: 2016-11-05 15:37:17

It's not so much the dissenting views as the batshit insane conspiracy theories, various personality disorders, and general dishonesty that is so common there.
I don't think my views are not allowed to be challenged here at all. In fact I've had several long discussions and debates on the subject here with people who disagree.
I believe for the most part the only thing that people need to avoid to adhere to the rules of the sub is promoting alternative software directly. That doesn't stop people from having discussions and debates about technical or economic issues at all. So that being the case I wouldn't really consider it a "safe space" type of sub like is at all. If anything people are encouraged to debate issues here, and this sub happens to also attract quite a few experts as well. 
Ideally the community wouldn't need any rules, and even though I was against the idea of that type of moderation back during the XT days, the results speak for themselves and I've been happy to have my initial stance proven wrong. Any reasonable who reads and compares these two subs can see the night and day difference between them.

@_date: 2016-02-16 08:18:07
Yes, when it comes down to it, the arrangement is between Gavin and whoever decides to pay him. However, if there is some criteria or philosophy behind the funding then it might be worth looking into, as they might consider it more appropriate to have someone more active who's contributing to Core in that position. Maybe not, who knows. But if Classic fails then I think it's at least worth exploring.
Right, no one forces you to run anything. But the blockchain and the consensus that comes along with that makes it a different situation. Politics play a part unfortunately. Especially when you have someone like Gavin spearheading multiple attempts to hard fork away from the implementation that has the consensus of the technical community.

They automatically hold BTC on the Classic chain, which they will want to sell if possible.


I don't think it will play out like that personally. I think even if miners do hard fork, the Core chain will still eventually win economically. Even if they're forced into changing the PoW.
It might be a bit chaotic for a while though. And it's also possible that both chains just get slaughtered price wise and lots of people just move on rather than trying to put effort in to making sure the Core chain stays viable. Some people will try though. But damage will be done to Bitcoin has a whole either way.

A while back someone designed a decentralized mining pool protocol where there's no central owner as there is with a regular mining pool. It never really caught on for more than a couple of percent of the hash rate or so from what I can remember, but it's always been thought of highly. And people have always advocated that everyone use P2Pool, but it's always more of a 'you go first, I'll follow' situation.

I really surprised you still have a viewpoint like this. The only thing I can think of is that you think Gavin and Jeff are somehow even remotely comparable to the people involved with Core.
Even without Core, the old chain would have the very redeeming quality of *not being Classic*. Lots of people would not even consider holding or using Bitcoin on a blockchain that has been hard forked to Classic.
A legit team of professionals presenting an actual technical argument towards hard forking with a well rounded group of cryptographers and academics in their network would be a completely different story though. Assuming they approached the idea of a hard fork responsibly of course. In that case the old chain might end up being insignificant.
@_date: 2016-02-16 12:01:12
Why do so many people who support Classic simply not believe that there are a lot of people(including many early adopters) who hold a lot of BTC who have no interest in holding BTC on a Classic hard fork?
If Classic goes off, and the price tanks, are they going to admit they were wrong? Or just come up with a new conspiracy theory to explain the drop?

People say that, but in reality developing and maintaining the reference implementation and consensus parameters requires a team of people. No one is forced to run the software they release though.
It's obviously a political coup, as there's certainly no superior technical solutions or plan that Classic is offering over Core. They just want them out and they want to be the ones to choose the consensus parameters.

The main issue is not as much them using ASICBOOST, as it is about them actively blocking a protocol improvement like segwit for secret reasons that are now (very likely) known, assuming that most of this is true.
I kept posting here having a hard time coming to terms with Jihan Wu really being as stupid as he's been acting. It seem that nagging suspicion had some merit to it. He has been playing his own game attempting to protect his covert mining advantage, while playing up the bullshit and using many people as pawns to assist him in doing so.
To be honest, on one hand it's actually a relief to know that someone as powerful as Jihan isn't actually a stupid idiot acting in a laughably irrational manner. Clearly now we know he's not, and it's just another interesting chapter in the history of Bitcoin. Of course we'd expect him to attempt to conserve this advantage that is potentially worth 9 figures.
Now the real question is, what are the other miners who have been losing at their own expense going to do about it now?
@_date: 2016-02-04 18:24:16
Well, there's still two scenarios that I can see happening where that doesn't happen. One of them pretty unlikely but possible, and the other probably pretty likely:
25% of the remaining hash power could decide to not hard fork. 25% is probably enough to tough it out until the next difficulty change. But blocks would be slow for a while. In this situation though there's always the threat of an attack from miners on the majority chain. So I think this is the less likely result.
The more likely scenario is that the minority chain would simply change the PoW algo and continue on. There would probably be enough people willing to stay the course and continue. 
But even if the minority chain dies as you predict, that doesn't invalidate my question at all. If there are a large amount of BTC that will be sold off on the new chain, that's surely an issue. You may not believe me, but I can pretty much guarantee that there are people holding lots of BTC that view a hard fork like this a 'game over' situation for Bitcoin, and thus will liquidate their holdings on the new fork. 
Which is why I posed the additional question at the end of how much BTC would it take for people to consider that their decision may not be an economically rational one. 
Maybe it would be better if I posed the question as something like 'what is the lowest price of BTC you would agree to if you had foreknowledge of the economic result of the hard fork?'. That actually gets to the point more. I'm sure everyone has a number, even if they don't know it yet. A 1% drop would be close to meaningless, but a 90% drop might not be.
@_date: 2016-02-07 14:04:26
Ok, but it's still a useful PSA for anyone wanting to place some bets. I could see someone buying their BTC as you say and then getting it out of there directly to the betting site. Which would result in a banning most likely. Having to take the extra step of sending it to some neutral wallet(preferably one you control) seems to be annoying but necessary in this case.

@_date: 2016-02-13 20:57:29
All it takes is a PoW change and a bit of support to keep the other chain running. I can't imagine a reason why people who disagreed with the hard fork wouldn't try to do this. Seems like the most logical response, but also results in two chains which is bad for the 'new Bitcoin' that just hard forked off. 
The value isn't necessarily going to be demolished either on the old chain. Not selling on the old chain is actually a pretty solid way of hedging your bets. If anything I could see both chain's value getting demolished, as really what's the point in holding during such a period of extreme uncertainty. And maybe not so much these days, but historically the market has loved huge dumps as the sharpest people just view it as a way to buy back in cheaper and the masses get spooked easily.

Ok, but you write that as if Core isn't addressing the scaling issue. And that they won't hard fork and raise the block size at an appropriate time if it makes sense to do so.
I do agree that many people have bought in to Bitcoin at various times under false pretenses. That's always been a problem from the start, since many people had no problems misrepresenting Bitcoin in an attempt to generate more demand/pump the price. Many, many people dismissed valid questions about how Bitcoin was going to scale as trolling and simplified the issue to something solved by just raising the block size. But we know now that it's not as simple as that.
But regardless of that, simplifying the scaling issue again as people have mistakenly done throughout the history of Bitcoin into something that's going to be fixed by another team kicking out the superior one, and raising the block size by 1MB solves absolutely nothing. And in my opinion would essentially reveal Bitcoin as somewhat of a sham and not very interesting any longer. Where the security model is easily undermined by politics. Mostly because it would reveal miners as a much weaker link than has been widely assumed since the beginning. Since a lot of the security model is based around the idea that miners will act rationally. And at this point I don't think it would be rational for them to take such an extreme position and hard fork. Obviously people who want a Classic hard fork feel the opposite. 
I think Classic supporters vastly overestimate the amount of economic consensus behind Classic. They already know that the technical consensus is against a Classic hard fork. But lots of people seem to believe that both miners and the economy will be overwhelmingly in favor of Classic. So I guess at this point we just have to wait and see what happens. Personally I don't think there's much of a chance of the hard fork happening at this point. But that should become more clear in the next little while.

He might be. I've been following Bitcoin for a long time now too, so I'm not sure. The biggest issue I see with him though is that from what I can tell he's convinced that if Classic hard forks it's inevitable that everyone follows that fork out of economic necessity. It's like he's applying the fact that actors mining SHA256 will always be compelled to mine whatever chain is more profitable for them. That's fine for mining, but the same logic doesn't carry over to the economy at large when the other chain can simply change the PoW algo. Miners only get to point their power at one blockchain, where as the economic equation is a completely different story altogether. There's no reason to think that all the people who are against Classic won't want to attempt to continue the non Classic chain.


There absolutely are. No doubt about it. Lots of BTC on either side. Which is why I see this potentially being similar to a nuclear mutually assured destruction situation.
The only thing that makes me less concerned about the Classic supporters who hold massive amounts of BTC not selling it all on the old fork is that holding it there is sounds like a good way to hedge their bets in case Classic doesn't work out for whatever reason. But who knows what they think. I would expect the Core chain to lose value as well, just not to the same extent that Classic will.
@_date: 2016-02-10 21:25:46
Yeah, it does kind of limit the ultra high end potential of Bitcoin to have what's only known to us as a single anonymous entity hold ~1 million BTC. I mean it's not that big of a deal for us today, and it's not stopping anything going on now. But when you think of the long tail scenarios where Bitcoin could really become a sort of digital gold, with nation states holding reserves and investment banks buying billions worth, the risk profile as a result of that sort of distribution kind of diminishes the chances of those scenarios playing out.
Not really a huge deal since it's probably kind of unlikely that such a thing would occur even with a more reasonable distribution. But it's kind of like the skeleton in the closet that no one really likes to talk about.

I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt too, and I've tried in vain to search for any sort of announcement of that lobbying trip, but I'm coming up empty. The timing of it right when Classic was announced indicates a very specific and premeditated political plan to take over Bitcoin.

It's not necessarily. But between Classic and Core the answer is pretty clear imo.

It's like saying someone's batting average for freeclimbing is .995. Sure, they have made it up alive often enough, but that one time they didn't was their last climb.
Bitcoin has to be designed against the worst case. It's something that too many people in the community seem to ignore.
And that doesn't mean that ideas aren't worth exploring, and of course anyone can come up with solutions. But when those ideas are explored, and the result of the peer review is negative, and you decide to personally reject that analysis because you're certain that you're right, then that's something that people should take note of.

He got offended that you made a comment about him being mentally ill and thinks it's 'clearly' not the case. But really, he should seriously consider seeing a professional. Especially after the whole Bitmain/Jihan reveal and the fact that he apparently can't come to terms with or grasp that he's a pawn. 
People in the community who he respects and are on good terms with him should seriously consider reaching out to him or something, because it's just getting more and more ridiculous.

I think it's valuable to have that kind of feedback publicly and I thought it was a good post too.
@_date: 2016-02-05 20:59:39
I agree. It seems like a huge threat.
Imagine Bitcoin went truly mainstream and the new mob majority rule dictating changes to the protocol was average people who watch Fox News and such?
I'm afraid that even if Classic fails we'll just see a never ending string of similar attempts. And if organizations that are opposed to Bitcoin see what's going on they might just decide that funding and backing these types of things might just be one of the more cost effective ways to attack Bitcoin.

Yeah, the Bitcoin community has had a massive problem with misleading people, to be perfectly honest.

That is a good question actually.
Flattr came out years ago and I don't think it ever really caught on.
With ChangeTip I think you can now deposit, tip, and withdraw all in USD now too. So there's a real world example of regular money being used in an additional layer(I think at least, seems that way).
@_date: 2016-02-02 16:19:27




No they won't. Someone will surely fork the code and call it 'Core'. But that won't be the Core that we know today.
@_date: 2016-02-05 19:00:46
It wouldn't really be appropriate to put a date on something that depends on many variables that are yet to be figured out. If it makes sense, I think it will happen. People seem to want Core to commit to something, but anything they commit to now would just be them pulling numbers and dates out of their ass just to please people.
It just doesn't make sense to go nuclear and hard fork to 2MB now. Meaning at the very least we're going to be looking at two hard forks instead of one.
@_date: 2016-02-17 06:59:00
It's not controversial if there hadn't been segwit announced and agreed on, but with segwit+2MB it's somewhat controversial still. Plus the general timing of putting a hard fork ahead of all the other changes is controversial since it's viewed as a poor way to deploy changes with additional risk. Including the fact that it will probably result in a minimum of 2 hard forks in a relatively short period of time. 2MB for political reasons, and then the actual technical consensus hard fork to whatever people think it actually should be after it's evaluated. Could be anything depending on how things go over the rest of the year, 3MB, 4MB? Maybe 2MB is enough? No one really knows yet, which is why doing it this way really undermines the plan for no good reason.

I pretty much agree with everything you're saying. Which is why I hope they're planning on using all the resources they can on marketing. A marketing team that can successfully acquire users to use a non-web application that also requires using Bitcoin will be one that should become legendary if successful. If they can pull it off I'd expect it to be taught in business schools for years to come. The web itself is like the epitome of 'network effect'.
I definitely wouldn't bother trying to compete with Amazon though. They are on another planet altogether and untouchable imo(for various reasons, some of which you touched on).
It's like the marketing equivalent of playing Civ 5 on 'Deity' mode. Although I admit I like the sound of such an epic challenge. Come to think of it, the UX person/people will have to be just as good as the marketers too.

Sigh... just another disingenuous sound byte/meme that they feed to their supporters. It comes up often enough too.
The more time goes on the more I wonder how much of what Gavin does is calculated and intentional. For a while it was pretty easy for people on the sidelines to assume good faith and such, but as time goes on I find my perception of quite a few people has changed a lot from the perceptions I held say back in 2014 and before then. I didn't know that he was literally a politician in his city either until recently. That was kind of a big 'oh, yeah that makes sense considering everything that's been happening' moment for me.

Yeah, he chose "Chief Scientist" has the title originally when the Bitcoin Foundation was formed way back when. I think I remember it being around 2012.
Yes, he's most certainly involved in general, not so much with Core in what seems like quite a while. If Classic successfully hard forks then that changes things. I'm more just wondering what happens if Classic goes the way XT did. At some point you have to question if that spot couldn't go to someone on Core who's been contributing positively. If Gavin tries Classic 2.0 or other subsequent attempts to hard fork away from Core it's probably worth discussing and learning more about exactly what these positions at MIT are meant for. If it's just some private corporate donor or something then there's not too much point in pressing the issue since it's their money.

Can't compete with the people who situate their mining farms near government controlled hydroelectric stations and get subsidized power. Even with a decent residential power rate like $0.10 kWh, you can't beat the people with $0.01 in the long run.
@_date: 2016-02-14 16:16:08
Are we talking about Classic vs Core specifically here?
If Classic forked with 75% of the hashpower(or higher of course, but minimum), why do you think that people wouldn't want to change the PoW for the old chain to continue it? And why do you think that it would be worth less than 1%?
You don't think that there are lots of early adopters with a significant amount of BTC that would sell after a Classic hard fork? Even one dude like Mircea dumping would be a shitload of BTC. 5 figures of BTC, quite possibly 6 figures depending on who you believe. And that's just a one person. There are a lot of people who have been around for a long time who wouldn't have interest in holding Classic BTC.
I find it a bit odd that so many people who support Classic outright disbelieve that many of the people who are against it will sell their coins on that chain. What's so hard to believe about that?
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:43:07
You may believe that you're not rejecting their plan or their work, but  the ones who determine the results of your action are them. You're not the first person that seems to have a very overly optimistic view of what the results of a Classic hard fork will be on the community.
The freedom is there. People are free to make their choice. Choosing Core isn't any less of a choice than choosing Classic is. But there are consequences to each choice and I don't think things will play out as you expect them to should a Classic hard fork occur.

@_date: 2016-02-01 16:10:48
Quitting or changing the PoW on a minority chain would only happen if they were forked away. It's a severe result from a severe maneuver against them.
The fact that Core is very likely to be raising the block size in that eventual hard fork makes it all the more confusing for me why people would choose Classic.
If user demands directly contradict what you believe to be a better and safer way to achieve the same result, would you compromise your ideals to please the crowd?
No one is trying to contain the freedom of choice of users. Being honest and and explaining what the likely results will be from a Classic hard fork are not threats as I see them. Saying that they won't be interested in continuing work on a project that no loner shares the same ideals seems like a normal reaction to me.

He did though for the most part in terms of directly contributing to Bitcoin. The whole moving on to work on big picture issues thing is something I got directly from what he's wrote on the subject. Of course that's not an exact quote, but if someone happens to have it, or a link that would be good. If I really have to go hunting for some specific quotes I will, but I feel it's fairly common knowledge that this is exactly what he did back then. Maybe even some people here who have been directly involved with Core can chime in and give us an idea of how involved he was with Core after Wlad took over his previous position.
He was in a thread here recently where I was criticizing him for the result of his stepping back to focus on big picture ideas being BIP 101 with a direct hard fork from 1 to 20MB blocks. He did his own testing and such and that was what he was willing to put his name on. My general point when talking about this subject isn't that he did absolutely nothing, it's that the results of him stepping back to work on solutions have been poor.
Of course since apparently he's been able collect the same paycheck and stop doing the heavy lifting that Wlad and others do we can't exactly be shocked that he's chosen this path.

I don't think that will be clear at all. Too many people consider Classic a 'game over' situation and will unload their BTC at the first opportunity to do so. 
Whether or not their other BTC on the Core chain will retain its value is not certain either. But a Classic hard fork will be faced with a massive amount of supply coming on to the market and it doesn't seem to be a situation that's going to be able to generate even close to enough demand to stop a devaluation.

Outside the US it's common where you can just send direct bank transfers to people that aren't easily clawed back like credit card payments(not saying it's impossible, but it's a whole different ballgame). So it's much easier and you can just use localbitcoins or even a company in your country.
Basically everything you said in your post is true and accurate for Americans. But thankfully the American system seems pretty unique and antiquated compared to my experiences in various countries.
I wonder how CEX.io handles local UK residents since they can just send a direct instant bank transfer from their phone or browser that's not a credit card payment. I'd imagine there's some security due to regulations. But I'm guessing less than what American's or people using credit cards/Paypal have to deal with. Maybe it's the same process for everyone. If it is then that sucks and I can only guess it's that way due to regulations or something(or me not understanding the banking system there which is possible too).

From where you're sitting, do you really feel that a rejection of Core and all the development that has happened and is on deck doesn't negatively affect you? Do you feel that the team behind Classic is a comparable replacement for Core?
Why do people keep saying that it's not rational for people to stay with the minority chain? If someone believes that Classic is a mistake, then they'll simply sell their BTC on that chain and evaluate what they want to do with their BTC on the minority chain. 
I've been trying to pose the hypothetical question of how low the price would have to drop post Classic hard fork for people to take a step back and admit it might have been a mistake, but I don't really get any straight answers. You seem like a reasonable person so I'll ask you the same question. Like, I'm sure we can agree that if Classic hard forked and the price dropped to say $50, that it was a mistake that didn't have sufficient economic support and that the miners who supported it made a misjudgment, agree? So what sort of price ranges in general are people going to view as evidence that the hard fork was a mistake? $100? $250? I really think people should be discussing this now and considering what scenarios could play out where enough supply gets flooded on to the post Classic blockchain to do some serious economic damage. Understanding and agreeing on what a failure might look like beforehand might actually help salvage some of that lost value by making sure everyone knows that the alternative is still there. I hope should the hard fork happen people consider 'hitting the undo button' and going back to whatever chain people not involved with Classic support as a valid option.
If people reject the Classic chain it doesn't take much for people who feel that the old chain is superior to decide that changing the PoW to try to salvage what might be left is a good idea. People keep presenting the decision as one where everyone has no other choice but to continue to hold their BTC on the Classic chain. But I think the reality is starkly different, and that people who reject Classic by selling and holding on the other chain have far more leverage than people who support Classic seem to think they do.

@_date: 2016-02-14 16:25:37
The community is not in a panic because there's very little chance that Classic is going to be successful in my opinion.
I don't think the Linux analogy works for Bitcoin. Maybe somewhat for the different implementations like bitcoinj, btcd, libbitcoin ect. But when you start talking changing the consensus though I don't think the analogy works at all.
From my viewpoint the only reason Classic even exists is fear and paranoia. It's being sold to people as the solution to a crisis that doesn't exist. And it's purely political, not technical.

Shit, the way Classic supporters throw around the opinions of "The Community™" and how Greg Maxwell has brought the wrath of The Community™ upon himself and Core, you would think that there really was tens of thousands of people behind Classic.
To be fair, most of them were probably fed this fiction from the people behind Classic. So hopefully by the time this little saga is over there will be a few people who do some honest reflection and avoid buying in to future political hype machines in Bitcoin.

Which is part of the reason why its so weird to see the CEO of Coinbase so far up the ass of Classic. Especially considering as far as I know, his CTO isn't behind Classic. It just screams desperation, but why? I thought Coinbase was one of the most well funded companies in the space. The only thing I can think of is maybe investors are starting to tighten the screws and it's on him to produce results or he's out. Not that that situation makes his decision even remotely smart or anything.

Source? Jeff seemed to be quite silent during the period that Classic gained a lot of attention. And I was specifically looking for something from him, but other than a retweet of Bitstamp saying they support Classic or something, I couldn't find anything. 
I(and everyone else?) only found out that he had gone to China to lobby miners after a while. And only because someone mentioned it in some sort of communication in Chinese that someone found and posted here with their translation. 
I may have missed some announcement from Jeff though, I'm not saying I know that he was silent 100%. So if you can point me to where he announced the lobbying trip I'd appreciate it. Because at the time it was pretty surprising to a lot of people that he'd done this, including myself.

Bob and his team world buy 500 BTC worth and then Lin would send him his money back so they could do it again to secure the vast majority of coins in their hands and give the impression that people were buying into the scam IPO for real.
After that was revealed and since Lin's rep was shot anyway, the exchange was "hacked" of all 7k of the BTC on the site(2nd hack, first one was legit). Lin claimed he filed a police report but people who tried to check up on that failed to find any evidence at all that it was true. Everyone lost their BTC and supposedly they're trying to pay people back or something. I wouldn't touch it with ten foot pole.

First memory I have from the start of this whole debate is gmaxwell asking to set some definitions and clarify exactly what decentralization means in this context. So I don't think he'd disagree with the notion of defining terms used in a debate.

I've watched mining since the days of Deepbit, and while certain pools such as Deepbit, BTCguild, and more recently Ghash had 40-50% of the hashrate, it was still a completely different situation. And I still considered it a joke and way too centralized. The fact the market and the miners were so slow to react and change seem now like blinking warning signs that 'rational miners and market highly valuing decentralization' is not quite the economic force you'd think it would be.
50000 full nodes, hobbyists running boxes with 4 radeon cards all over the world. It was vastly more decentralized. Still kind of shit with idiots flocking to pools that dominate the hash(idiots or the system's incentives don't work well? Maybe I'm the idiot), but compared to now it would be a dream to have that level of decentralization back. I'm so conditioned to the modern centralization that I'd take that back in a heartbeat if it meant getting Bitcoin mining out of Chinese control.
Mining is absolutely more centralized now than it has ever been. Technologically, geographically, financially.
If this whole thing is fated to tend towards centralization then that just may be the case. If it doesn't get solved then what's the answer? It certainly appears that way now. Maybe there's no answer at all. Decentralization is just a transitory state maybe.

Yes, Davout ran Instawallet where your wallet is your own unique URL. Which was exploited/hacked or whatever, and people lost a bunch of money in 2012. At least one of the 'exploits' was people's wallet URLs coming up in Google and Yahoo searches.
I lost some, but at the time the amount was nothing worth worrying about. It was convenient to use as a hot wallet, but not something you should have been storing a lot of money on(of course). One person claims to have lost over 1000 BTC on there however.
Maybe that's not what you're thinking of though.

I don't see it violating their rational self interest, I see a contentious hard fork doing so though. One of the reasons being the topic in this thread.
So if it's as you say and OldBitcoin has low depth then that pair will just be effectively worthless and trade at altcoin price levels, which is pennies to dollars. So that satisfies one half of the economic destruction.
I really don't see what's so hard to believe about people who feel that their money is better else where in a post-Classic scenario. It's like if there were a hard fork that raises the 21 million hard cap, that would probably violate what you define as 'Bitcoin', and you'd sell and no longer be interested in it. And there are lots of people who feel that a 75% hard fork to Classic also violates their conditions of what Bitcoin is to them. I don't find it that surprising that after such an event some people might feel that money is safer distributed over gold, silver, possibly some promising alts if they exist, business investments ect.

That's a good point. So many people seem to have this strange idea that reddit is the end all be all of Bitcoin. And moderation policies on one sub or another are such a big deal that they're willing to cause massive discord and strife over what's essentially just a weak aggregation of things that are happening in Bitcoin.
One of the last things I read over there was a post claiming that this sub is some sort of mirage full of paid shills or something with no real genuine users and people. It's pretty weird. Especially since a lot of people have been posting a lot longer than has even existed in any sort of populated state.

I've been saying this for years to people who thought that everyone would just be jumping on Bitcoin. There's no incentive for them to make you rich for no reason. Of course the big players are going to try to do it themselves.
Also, agree that there's been absolutely no mention of R3 wanting to go the cryptocurrency route.
The only thing even close to any of these big organizations being interested in cryptocurrency was some comment I read recently from the IBM guy who said they're going 'all in' on 'blockchain'. He said something like it's going to be for everything, including money. Or something like that. It was still incredibly vague and doesn't make me think they're talking about actual cryptocurrency at all.

Bitmain can build and maintain those 24 data centers as nodes processing blocks in the hundreds of MB. Truly a brave new world of international decentralized currency. And if you don't like it you can fuck you mother if you want fuck.
There are people who are actually comfortable with the idea that data center size nodes being the standard requirement is what Bitcoin should aim towards.
I really don't get what people who are willing to compromise decentralization are thinking. Is it that they think this scaled up version of Bitcoin is going make them more money? It's already centralized to the point where I can't honestly say that it's turning out to be a success, regardless of price. Eventually people are going to realize that Bitcoin is pointless when it's run by a few. Just make a federated currency then and stop wasting money on PoW.
@_date: 2017-04-27 05:20:15
I don't have an answer for you, and I'm also curious.
But for now, lets start from the other end of it: Why were we expecting there not to be a monopoly on ASIC manufacture for a product that 1) benefits *massively* from economies of scale, and 2) can easily be determined to be objectively better than competitors(more efficient, more profitable/better ROI)?
@_date: 2017-04-21 10:37:07
Credit cards are excellent for any consumer that approaches them in a smart and responsible manner. Lots of upsides that are subsidized by the people who provide the profits for the card issuer. 
Bitcoin never had a chance of competing with cash back and various other rewards. Not to mention full consumer protection and theft reimbursement. Then sometimes various insurance like travel insurance that can also come as part of the package.
Bitcoin is good, it's just shouldn't have ever been presented as some kind of competitor in that arena.
Consumer payments and coffee were never the point. People clinging on to this in 2017 are simply delusional. If we would just move forward then we might eventually get some decent consumer payment rails that take it from 'not great' to 'ok'. But for that to happen people need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture and stop holding progress back.
@_date: 2016-02-11 13:03:06


I can't see it being much of a risk as much as it being close to a guarantee. There has to be quite a few people who will absolutely refuse to continue participating on a Classic chain. And even if the PoW has to be changed for security reasons, lots of people will want to stick with what they see as the Bitcoin consensus rules that they prefer.

Normally I wouldn't recommend anyone putting all their money into Bitcoin, but if you plan to work and also get paid while you're in there and can manage to save up some cash for when you get out, it makes putting the $5k into BTC less of a big deal.

But he stepped aside from developing years ago. His excuse was that he was stepping back to work on bigger picture issues. The results speak for themselves really. I'm honestly not sure why people elevate him the way they do.
One observation I made when this whole block debate started, was that lots and lots of people in the community had absolutely no idea that he hadn't been the lead maintainer for Bitcoin for quite a while. I want to say at least a year and a half back before mid 2015 when Mike and Gavin took to their blogs to stir things up, but I can't remember the exact date that Wladimir took over the position. Either way, it was also very telling that so many of those people not only still thought Gavin was the lead maintainer and heavily involved in development, but apparently had no idea who the person who replaced him so long ago actually was.
The most annoying and disappointing thing about this whole debate is the politicizing of it and targeting of low information users. Getting everyone riled up by creating crisis and controversy and then trying to ride that momentum into hard forks. Thankfully it didn't work for XT and I'm fairly certain it's not going to work for Classic either. Still really annoying and saps the community's time and resources.

It's not just a simple increase to 2MB though, it's an outright rejection of Core and its scaling plan that many people in the technical community support. There will very likely be no going back to Core as we know it should this hard fork occur.

Yes, actually rejecting the Core teams scaling plan and going with Classic is effectively firing them. And I hope people and miners understand the seriousness and consequences of the change they're considering.
You make it sound like Core by not signing their name in blood to some silly date where they make a commitment to a hard fork that they're against raising the block size.
Whereas what they're actually doing is trying to approach the idea in the most technically sound way. Most people seem to agree that a block size hard fork will eventually be necessary as part of the overall strategy. It seems that the only bone people have to pick with them is that they haven't "committed" or "compromised", which is incredibly silly because pulling numbers and dates out of your ass to please people shouldn't really be something that's demanded of them.
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:26:24

All it takes is a PoW change for security to make staying on the old chain reasonable.
Your perception of the situation is completely wrong. You think all the early adopters that stand by Core are just going to say fuck it and go with Classic? Classic to many people is a 'game over' condition for them, and represents a complete failure of Bitcoin as a project. Massive amounts of BTC will be sold on the new majority chain as soon as possible. Maybe on both chains even.
@_date: 2016-02-15 17:54:48
I don't have any additional information, I just found it interesting. And I should probably clarify that I don't think that it's a bad thing or that it reflects poorly on him. More like it helps me understand where he's coming from and that the political approach that's been taken with Classic and XT hasn't just been naive coincidence. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 13:55:45
There's still hope that some will be willing to continue on the minority chain with a new PoW for security reasons.
I'm sure someone will. But the big question is who and how many.
Although I still have enough faith that people will see how bad a Classic hard fork would be and come to their senses.
Interesting thought experiment for people who support Classic that I've been wanting to pose:
If assume you had a way to know exactly how much BTC would be sold off on the Classic chain as soon as possible after the hard fork, how much total BTC sold would cause you to reconsider your support of the hard fork? 
It's easy to say something like 14 million, or no amount, or something like that and disregard the question entirely. But I think trying to consider the question as a rational economic actor is more interesting.

I didn't say that *all* people who support Classic are low information users, and I certainly didn't mean to imply that if that's how you read my post. Just that the name and the propaganda appears to have been specifically designed to cater to those types in the community. Even from the beginning with Mike and XT, the rhetoric has been crafted in a manner that resembles a populist political style. 
You can still support Classic and agree with my view since the whole situation is inherently political. And it's not really too surprising that people gunning for a hard fork that requires a lot of support have used such political tactics. 
I don't like that politics and persuasion in Bitcoin have turned out to be such an important part of the system though. It just seems that's the reality of the situation. And I guess myself and anyone else who is surprised or disappointed in that reality was just naive.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:50:09
I don't really wonder why, as I've seen the political maneuvering that has been used by people who don't want Core to continue.
What's surprising is the fact that so many people who you would expect to have a better grasp on the situation considering their positions would actually support Classic.

@_date: 2017-04-10 13:22:54
IMO it's such a huge and show stopping problem that it's simply not comfortable to speak about because there's pretty much nothing realistic we can do about it. So we just go with the flow and hope mining redecentralizes at some point one way or the other.
Between the manufacturing and mining the amount of centralization in (like you say) an authoritarian regime that 
can pull the 'communism' card at any time to justify anything is just a complete failure of the original intentions of Bitcoin as I see it.
On the bright side it seems the community is gearing up more ways to fight back and are more willing to prepare their own 'nuclear' responses like PoW changes and such if necessary. It's still a complete clusterfuck though no matter how you look at it.
The funny thing is that I don't think the market really cares too much. There's just too much invested in Bitcoin already that I think people just accept things the way they are and hope for the best. That's fine I guess. The price is doing well and will probably continue to do well.
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:54:30
Yes, but segwit is multiplicative so eventually when the max block size cap is raised it will be more effective. Plus there's work on weak blocks and IBLTs that apparently might be promising.
A big issue that people seem to have is that they haven't committed to a specific date to hard fork. But I don't really see that as a problem. I'd rather the time be taken to make sure that the block size is raised to whatever makes the most sense after there's more information to base the decision off of. What's the point of forking to 2MB now(especially now that segwit is in the picture) when it's not really clear exactly how high the block size will need to be raised. Maybe it's 4MB. What's the point of doing two hard forks just because everyone is over reacting and thinking that Core won't take appropriate action to scale Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:14:31
The issue has nothing to do with 2MB and everything to do with a political coup to remove Core from taking the reins of the Bitcoin project. It's scary that anyone is even considering Classic as a viable replacement for Core.

The people who named their 2MB aggressive hard fork implementation "Bitcoin *Classic*" are disingenuous?
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:53:56
Core already found a first step solution on a much bigger plan to scale Bitcoin in segwit which would result in an effective capacity increase to ~1.7MB depending on wallet implementation. So Core is already offering a similar solution.
I highly doubt many people who contribute to Core will be interested at all in supporting Classic. You're effectively firing them and rejecting their plan and work. Quite a few people seem to think some combination of either Core developers moving on to work on Classic, or that the option will be available to just go back to the Core development team for help should things go wrong. The chances of that happening are slim to none from what I can tell.
@_date: 2017-04-10 18:49:38
Yeah, the thing is too that this has been normal now for so long now and the Chinese government has seemed fine with Bitcoin for the most part. So it doesn't seem like there's much danger, and there probably isn't. At least in the short term. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 18:10:51
Not sure how it works. If Classic fails then I think it's probably worth looking into though. Just in case the philosophy behind the research funding is one that would go against the idea of funding this type of adversarial approach to hard fork Bitcoin away from Core. For all I know though they might be fine with it, who knows. Especially if it's something that's privately funded and those donors choose rather than the Media Lab administrators themselves.
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:05:46
Yeah, I think probably most people here are still thinking of the older original plan of censorship resistance. I think the team has been pretty straight forward about shifting away from that, but the original idea is still firmly implanted in everyone's memories.
I don't know any specifics, but I believe there are people who are working on separate projects that are targeting censorship resistance. I've seen the name 'Drop Zone' mentioned, but I don't know anything about the project personally.
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:39:08
No, not really. Facebook being able to be monetized was always a no brainer. The question was just 'how much is realistic?' and 'what's a reasonable valuation?', since we're talking about billions of dollars.
I don't think Open Bazaar will have the same monetization options as something like facebook has. Just the user acquisition part of it will be a legendary marketing accomplishment if they're successful. Let alone monetization. Not that I think it will be impossible for them to monetize, should they have a large user base. Just that compared to facebook their options are going to be inherently smaller since facebook pretty much has each user by the balls as soon as they agree to sell their identity to them by signing up.

No. What's insane is forking away from Core to something like Classic. Especially seeing as how Core will scale Bitcoin, and they're clearly the best team to do so. Forking to 2MB with no plan and jtoomim as the new lead maintainer of the Bitcoin project is just really stupid to be honest. Core is absolutely world class. Classic is not.
@_date: 2016-02-15 15:29:57
There's a difference from thinking that he is out to harm Bitcoin intentionally, and not wanting him to have the political power to make decisions that you believe are harmful.
If Classic doesn't work out, and I highly doubt it will, how much longer can Gavin justifiably receive a salary for his involvement in Bitcoin? I'd assume the salaries were meant for actual participating developers, but there's probably a wide range of things that can fall under research. To me the idea that he's getting what I presume to be a generous salary(I think he was getting around 200k before from the foundation) for his contributions to Bitcoin in the last couple of years is pretty ridiculous.

Well lucky for us I guess, since Core is putting their efforts in to scaling Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-14 20:37:05
It's a political issue rather than a small difference in block size. Much bigger deal than that. It's not a trivial change, it's an outright rejection of the people behind Core and the opinions of the majority of the  technical community.
Yes I agree with what you've said in general. But I was specifically responding to him making the claim that "NO one will stay on a chain that has 40% of hashpower." and how it doesn't really accurately describe what could potentially happen. I think his perception is wrong because I don't think he's considering the full range of potential outcomes based on him making such a comment with absolute certainty. 
I'm confident that there's a not insignificant amount of people who have no interest continuing on the Classic chain. So at the very least, the most minimal impact this group of people could have is selling their BTC on the new chain and not participating after that. Not even considering the alternate scenarios of a PoW change and such, there are a lot of people in the 'no interest in Classic group' who have been around Bitcoin for a very long time, and would be considered early adopters who will want out. So I think it's likely based on the current situation staying the same that there will be more supply than demand should Classic successfully execute their hard fork.
I don't claim to know anything with certainty. But it's also clear that people seem to have been mislead as to what the actual range of outcomes could be should the hard fork actually happen. Which is one of the many reasons I'm very much against Classic, as it's hard to watch so many people get mislead, intentionally or not.

I think there's well over six figures of BTC that would be unloaded on the Classic chain as soon as possible.
Even a single person can sell off a very signifigant amount. Does anyone have a ball park figure on how much BTC Mircea Popescu holds? I don't really follow him so I don't know anything more than that it's 'a lot'.
Roger Ver could also single handedly sell a very large amount on the Core chain if he decided to do so. But I'd guess he would hedge his bets and hold on both. That is unless he's not just supporting Classic, but has gone full anti-Core.

Some people think that it's being kept in a range that people will feel more comfortable with, as it's distributed over multiple pools to keep up appearances.

Do you happen to have a link announcing it? You're not the first person I've seen mention this, and the last person who I asked for a source eventually took back the statement as he couldn't find the source.
And I was specifically paying attention looking for some kind of communication from Jeff during the period that Classic was announced, because I was pretty surprised to see his name on the developers list. But he was more or less silent other than retweets. Then it was reported in other places on the internet in Chinese that he was there doing this(or these) meetings. And was translated here and posted for everyone to see, and people were all surprised and no one mentioned anything about an announcement. 
So if you happen to have any source on his announcing his intentions, it would help a lot to clear up mine and another peoples confusion on this matter. Because to a lot of people it absolutely looks like a backroom deal.

The problem seems to be that many people who support Classic just don't seem to understand how many people with significant economic power(ie BTC) are completely against it. And how many people will just take the first chance they get to sell their BTC on that new chain. 
Having SHA256 miners mining on whatever chain makes them the most money seems to be given far more importance here in the mental model of how a hard fork will work by Classic supporters. That's far less relevant than people seem to think. Biggest reason is that there's massive incentive for people on the minority chain to hard fork to a new PoW function as soon as possible.

I've been saying that I predict something similar will happen as well.
Although, I doubt Satoshi would show up at all.
But the amount of BTC that will be dumped on the Classic fork will be huge even without Satoshi. A large amount may also be dumped on the Core chain, but I think a lot of the big holders that are behind Classic will realize that it would be better for them to hold and hedge their bets. Many people see a successful Classic hard fork as a 'game over' situation for Bitcoin, so no reason to hold Classic BTC at all.

Love the fact that Classic roped people in to their bullshit by listing all those miners on their site as people backing the project.
It's almost as if they used Toomim's survey of miners to ask them what block size they would be willing to support as an agreement to back Classic and a hard fork rejecting Core. 
If [miner] says they would theoretically be willing to support larger blocks, add [miner] to list of Classic supporters.
Very ethical way of drumming up and reporting on "consensus" Classic team.
What a fucking joke. I can't get over how many people in this community just eat their shit up though. People who know better should be ashamed of themselves, and people who don't should seriously take a look at the people in the community that you look up to for guidance. You were manipulated.

It is not a company aiming to please customers, but rather an open, loosely affiliated group trying their best to produce what they believe to be the best reference client and consensus parameters for Bitcoin.

It's possible and perhaps a better approach that would result in more decentralization than we have now. But like you say I still think the people who have the advantage now will still hold a very significant advantage due to their resources. Perfect is the enemy of good though and doing that could be the difference between Bitcoin being controlled as it is now and it not being controlled. 
Unfortunately I don't think it's remotely likely that Bitcoin will have the will to push for that type of thing. I think everyone is already all-in on what we have now and we'll see whether it can work or not. Something big has to change for me to personally consider it a  non-failure though. I'm hopeful but not optimistic given the money and power that's already established.

Yes, the massive shift towards centralization and the basic assumputions about miner incentives being put into question have pushed my skepticism to an all time high. 
On a personal level, with the current state of Bitcoin, I don't think I could defend the state its in now from a place of intellectual honesty.
I do however hope that the push back and response can mitigate or even solve a lot of these issues and get the project back on track. I think there's a decent chance of that happening. But wow, a lot of people need to wake the fuck up and get back on the same page here.

It wasn't even that long ago, like last decade, when the stereotype of the hard working startup living off ramen to make it work was common(and maybe even considered noble). It's just interesting how quickly times change.
Also, I remember it being common for people coming into startups to take a vastly reduced salary too in exchange for equity. I guess the market is so competitive now that startups are forced to pay competitive-with-Google type of salaries now?

BIP102 if I had to choose would be the one I supported as well. But the game is changed with the implementation of segwit in the works. So 2MB isn't just 2MB any longer, and we're getting around 1.7MB with segwit depending on wallet implementation, so I'm happy. No reason to fork the whole project away from Core over such a trivial matter. Clearly it's more about a political coup here than a tech argument.
If anything, awesome tech improvements like segwit give me more reason to trust Core. And I've been highly critical of what I once thought was a Bitcoin that would never receive any kind of actual innovation mainly due to political barriers, but I was very wrong. Sometimes you get slam dunk ideas like segwit where everyone agrees and there's no opposition.
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:40:09
Right. Because anyone in Core thinks 1MB is a magic number.
2MB is the current magic number. Why hard fork to 2MB now before we know what the best estimate will be for how much we will likely need to raise the blocksize in the future once we have a better grasp on the situation and more data? ie ~12 months from now.
It could be 2.5 or 4. Who knows yet.
@_date: 2016-02-13 14:43:41
I guess he sees that one of the many ways Bitcoin is going to be scaled is here. So no point in doing the most extreme option possible in Bitcoin and hard forking to a sub par dev team for a measly 2MB.
That's good that people are seeing why Classic is not a very good idea. But it still makes me wonder what the heck all these people were thinking to begin with.

Last I read you had to host your own storefront on OB, so in that sense it would be similar to hosting your own website(although I know it's easier for most people to pay 5 bucks a month for shared hosting or similar).
The thing that I'm most worried about with OB is how shoppers are going to find it. It's not like storefronts are going to come up in Google searches. Getting people to download separate software to browse is kind of a big road block.


No, but I just can't imagine how something like OB could possibly approach what something like Amazon offers buyers and sellers. I use the self hosted website example because all else being equal, as of today it seems like between running a self hosted website that accepts BTC and running an OB shop, at least the self hosted website can be indexed in Google. Which seems like a massive advantage.
I don't want to sound too negative, as I don't really have anything against what OB is doing and I do actually hope they can succeed. But I don't really see the problem that they're solving and I can't imagine how they'll be able to acquire enough users to make something like a marketplace work well. If it was on the web, then it would be different, since things can go viral. But as a separate network in competition with the web, if we think the network effect of Bitcoin is what gives it its advantage, then something like the www should be virtually impossible to compete with.

Plus as soon as this started apparently Jeff Garzik flew to China to lobby the miners himself. 
So yeah, there must be a massive information asymmetry now for them to be actually considering Classic.
Really goes to show just how dangerous the state of Bitcoin is right now even without Classic.
No question that they've played the populist political game to a tee, while the other side just sits and hopes that sanity prevails.
The idea that for Bitcoin to survive long term there will probably have to be a strong counter-political force to protect it just makes me feel tired and disapointed.

@_date: 2016-02-02 16:00:51
Bitcoin could very well be a failed project. We'll see how things go over the next little while.


Not now because Core is implementing the scaling plan in order and if a hard fork is needed to raise the size of the blocks then it's not the first step.  
Why does everyone want to have two hard forks instead of one at the appropriate time? First thing that's being implemented is segwit, which should allow an effective ~1.7MB capacity increase depending on wallet implementation. 
So why reject Core's roadmap and the opinion of so many highly regarded experts in the community? It's all clearly just a political move to remove the Core developers from involvement in Bitcoin. Core's plan is solid and there's no reason not to let them scale Bitcoin unless you don't trust them for some reason. And Classic seems to be aimed at people who don't trust Core, since that's really the only reason you would hard fork away from their software for a measly 2MB increase. Especially when Core is already bringing effectively ~1.7MB just as the very first step in a long term plan to scale Bitcoin as effectively as possible.

Well, Jeff's backroom meetings aside, what I said was unethical was the way that support that may have or may have not actually been there has been presented on the website and in posts here. I mean, it was pretty apparent rather quickly when the HaoBTC boss guy was posting and asking for advice on the situation while the Classic website has their organization listed as a supporter from the very beginning. At the very least it's clear that Classic has claimed some very heavy support from both miners and users, but the reality seems much more murky.
Other than that I don't really disagree with anything you've said. Time will tell how this plays out on the blockchain.

Either way, a simple federated peg with something like Elements could probably work well as a sidechain for transactions. It won't be completely trustsless or anything, but for microtransactions or something similar it could probably work fine until the two way peg stuff is all worked out.

It makes zero sense for someone not to own such a device. Sure, in theory with the proper laws and such a car could 'own' itself, but why? What's the point?

I don't think mining is something that would be worth doing if you can instead mine private keys.
Maybe the first people might be ethical and not do that. But it won't take long for someone to get greedy. But on the other hand they'd have to pretty much keep it as secret as possible. As BTC would be worth nothing if you had someone capable of getting private keys.

Firing the best developers in Bitcoin and replacing them with *Classic* of all things definitely appears to justify any fear.
You post as if Core has outright refused to ever raise the size of blocks. They have a plan, and many people seem to think that it's likely that the block size will need to be raised at an appropriate time in line with the overall technical scaling plan. 
It's hard to politely put it just how crazy it is to fork away from Core right now. Especially as there's absolutely nothing that's being offered from Classic that can be considered a technical improvement. It's strictly a political hard fork as a power grab.
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:12:27
They will raise the max block size if and when it makes sense to do so. I'm not sure what's so difficult for people to grasp. The arguments against Core seem to boil down to people not trusting Core to scale Bitcoin.

I've totally lost respect for both Gavin and Jeff at this point. Sure, Gavin has been slowly pissing it away for a while now. But Jeff's silence that turned out to be  a trip to China to *literally* make backroom deals when Classic was first announced, and the timing of this article here and the political ooze seeping out of it just makes me want to throw up.
And the tone of Classic's release about them pursuing improvements in block propagation and such, presenting it in a way that makes it (at first glance, or to anyone not really clued in) that the work they'll be merging eventually is a result of their efforts...ugh(and you know most of their base happens to be low information types who are going to glance at these release notes and get the impression that this "team" has been pumping out code or something). And I've already started to see the Classic supporters busting off their new meme of the day of some form of "cypherpunks write code"/"shut up and code" ect. Implying that the Classic developers are the ones staying out of it and producing all this killer code! It's just so fucking ridiculous. Watching all this shit go down in real time and see people manipulated and played is unreal.
And the very idea that Bitcoin of all things is a place where dirty political bullshit that everyone is just sick of in their own countries or communities is now the reality here as well and may never change is just sad. I'm still pretty confident that at the end of the day, there's really no argument for switching to Classic, and overall the community can't be *that* batshit to actually support it. But the very idea that it's even a remote possibility is just sickening. Not the idea that another team could cause a hard fork. If there was some legitimate technical disagreement rather than a transparent political game, that would be an entirely different story.

Yeah, I'm a bit tired of people bringing up this whole 'autonomous agents' idea again and again over the years. It makes no sense from any realistic perspective. Now, of course people being the private owners of various automatic systems is virtually inevitable and already exists now more or less. But I think the only way we get anything remotely close to real autonomy is maybe through some government/public initiative. And that's a big maybe. But even then it's the same shit with the government(and in theory the people) being the ultimate owners. Not true autonomy.

That's the thing about Bitcoin. It only works if and only if demand outstrips supply strongly. Obviously it was designed with this in mind though. And so far it's done excellently, but it's still a very big and interesting experiment that no one can really predict the result of. 
For me personally, technical concerns are minimal. But I think the greatest threat would be lowered demand due to a major government actively taking steps to suppress it. It doesn't really matter whether or not it can be killed via technology when all it will really take is a sustained economic attack.
So far so good though and if anything the general response overall from governments has been neutral to good imo.

Bitcoin's monetary inflation is correctly described here.
Price inflation is different though, yes. But Bitcoin is price deflationary if and only if demand exceeds supply. So there's nothing *inherently* deflationary about Bitcoin at all. Its monetary base inflation is just designed with the intention of Bitcoin being price deflationary. Similar to how central banks use monetary base inflation to attempt to keep price inflation within their desired range. With one major obvious difference being it's difficult to change the rate of monetary base inflation with Bitcoin.

Roger Ver himself is a walking example on why anarchy is unlikely to be any kind of utopia. People just seem to fuck up every political system there is. Systems that give too much power to governments tend to suck, but systems that give too much power to people like Ver are also very likely to suck imo.
Unfortunately Bitcoin as a system has Ver as a bad actor with too much power. Thankfully he only appears to be a strain on the system rather than someone who's going to break it. Would be great if he could move on gracefully to other pastures. He needs to see a mental health professional I think.

Why don't you think that mining will continue to centralize around the cheapest power sources on earth?
If say most of the world pays $0.10-0.30 kWh and all the big mining farms are centralized around the super cheap $0.01-0.02 government subsidized industrial zones, how is it ever going to change?
I don't see how chips reaching the limits of physics changes anything at all about the way mining tends towards centralization. The game pushes out all but the most efficient miners. There's no reason that having the most efficient chips possible is going to change the fact that someone like myself would have to pay 10-20x more to mine than a mega farm.

Besides this, in general Bitcoin seems to have had some divine protection or luck to have made it into what we all hope today is something that's very robust and secure. Lots of good work by the developers. I think a serious determined attacker like the one that's putting in the effort to blast Ethereum recently probably could have done massive amounts of damage over the years. But I think most people capable of that probably knew they'd gain more by supporting it. If someone was motivated by ideology rather than money though it could have been pretty messy. Especially if they were willing to spend money attacking.
If Bitcoin shorts were liquid and available early on and Bitcoinica didn't shit the bed as it did, I think there's a very good chance that Bitcoin would still be a toy currency as it once was rather than what it has evolved into today. There just wasn't much incentive to attack for a long time.

People will think it makes economic sense to stay with the chain they think will be more economically viable in the long term, and that would be the original chain imo.

I'm curious if there are any people who used to support Classic and such that have reached their limit now with this new obstruction effort?
I know there were a few people who were basing their argument mainly on the fact that that Segwit didn't actually exist, and that Lightning was even further from being a reality. (Part of that was from certain people shouting that Bitcoin needed to scale *right now* and the only way to do that was to raise the max block size, and if it didn't something something crash landing. We seem to be flying rather nicely if you ask me. But I guess that's another topic.)
So now that Segwit is here, and Lightning development has moved on quite a bit(and from what I understand there have been a few testing milestones and such), are there people who have said enough is enough, let's just move on with the scaling additions that now actually exist and are viable?
@_date: 2016-10-11 15:54:23

I don't think it is yet. They plan to open source it eventually though. Although they are probably going to have to seriously consider not doing that if they plan to continue down the same business path that they appear to have started.
edit: I'll just add that I believe they're genuine when they say they plan to open source it. It's just not easy to monetize open source, so perhaps there will be some friction there. Not sure. I say this because I don't think consumer integrated mining is viable. So I think the value they provide on a software level will end up being what they do. If they were going to sell millions of hardware devices, then sure they probably wouldn't have much of a problem open sourcing their software if it's being funded like that.

The only reasonable explanations are either they're solving more blocks than they would be expected to on average given their hashrate(luck), or they added a large amount of hashing through standard data center mining farm operations. There's zero chance that there's enough mining going on from their devices to add that much hashrate. Remember that their devices are 50 gigahash miners, and the Bitcoin network itself is half an exahash total.
I'm sure that's self evident to most people here, but unless I misunderstood the intention of your post it seems like you may be trying to imply that their devices now comprise 4% of the Bitcoin network. If that's not what you were intending with your post then apologies for missing the point.

It's not bad when you already have bitcoin and an incentive to spend it. It's the getting it, and then having a reason to spend it which makes it not great as a consumer payment method(ignoring other issues like credit card fraud protection/refunding). 
If there's a future where it's common for people to have some bitcoin already, then it can work fine as an additional payment option. But the Bitcoin economy has to grow itself first, payments are an afterthought really.

And even if satoshis were required his original question and the intent of it was perfectly valid.

Bitcoin is the experiment that gets to test the diminishing block reward theory and that's not going to change.

Which is good because we'll eventually get to see how things actually work out in reality. But Bitcoin definitely has to stay how it is.

I'm more worried about the mining farms being targeted rather then the exchanges. If over 60% of the hash power is in China right now a government take over of it would probably be the worst case scenario for Bitcoin.
At least if some of the exchanges get shut down we have a variety of established exchanges outside of China that the Chinese can still use via VPN if need be.

Apples to oranges comparison. The equivalent amount of hashing for scrypt is much lower since it's significantly slower than SHA256.
One way we can estimate the relative security is try to figure out how much mining power needs to be purchased and at what price to launch a &gt;50% attack. It should be pretty significant for both chains.

Colored coins?
Zero transaction fee that includes data related to colored coin transactions(that incidently don't require satoshis any longer).
Now in reality, you might not find any miners to mine a fee-less transaction for you. But the idea that Bitcoin's blockchain can be used as something that stores data representing other tokens of value without transacting in BTC is a valid idea.

I'm behind 21 from a software/vision standpoint and I like what I see so far with the tools that they offer. But I'm skeptical of the mining aspects. If I'm going to pay $9.99 a month for Netflix, my television producing $9.99 in bitcoin to subsidize that subscription is likely going to cost me much more than $9.99. People have been running the numbers for a long time now since 21 first planned to put chips in USB hubs and such, and I haven't seen any math that indicates that it's going to be even close to beneficial for consumers  run such a product. Bitcoin mining is just too competitive to offer any sort of value to a single end user.
And I'm not concerned with the mining even being profitable, it doesn't have to be, but if someone ends up paying $15 in electricity for their $9.99 Netflix subscription then I think it's pretty clear that the idea that sounded good in theory a while back just didn't pan out. 
I'm not negative on 21 at all. But I'm a bit disappointed that their software meant to help build the Bitcoin economy is gated behind an expensive chip that doesn't actually provide any utility to the developers that the software is aimed at to begin with.

What they're planning to do probably has nothing to do with cryptocurrency in general, so it's not worth comparing. 
All this Fintech stuff is irrelevant to Bitcoin though from what I can tell. And the only reason it keeps getting brought up is that the boom going on right now in that industry seems to have been inspired by looking at the tech behind Bitcoin's own blockchain. But the results are not going to look like Bitcoin, and probably not going to be what we would define as blockchains anyway. Notice how they specifically use the term 'distributed ledger'. 
All this Fintech stuff is real, and will probably have some interesting implications for their own industry. In the end though it's like saying something like Tesla is doing some great things with battery tech these days. It's interesting, but unrelated to cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2015-11-19 14:19:24
Nah, it won't mine much but I don't think it's quite that bad. I think you get a few cents worth a lot quicker than that. Remember that they need to pay for transactions if they're going to broadcast them normally and have them picked up by someone other than the 21 mining pool. If it's a 21 to 21 transaction I assume they would just be using their internal off chain transaction server.
 says it should return $0.13 a day with 50 gh. That's a solid 3 transactions a day on chain normally broadcasted with 0.0001 in fees.

I have to disagree with this. Even though there were large pools like Deepbit, BTCGuild, and Ghash commanding large portions of the hashrate, the mining was actually more decentralized because the total amount of individual miners was higher. Back then mining was done by regular people who could use their CPU(at the very beginning) or mainly their GPU(s) to mine.
Now we have massive mega farms in China taking up percentages of the total hashrate. It was inevitable(probably), but I don't think it's fair to say it's the right direction. In fact every major issue right now that's being debated with regard to upgrading Bitcoin itself boils down to the issue of preventing mining becoming more centralized than it already is.
Also, you can have a million contributors, but that the end of the day you have one lead maintainer and two or three people who he decides what to merge with. I'm not saying there's any other better answer, or that people can't use something other than Core, but it's not exactly great.

Balaji taught a Stanford online course where you use a free AWS instance and Heroku to set up your own Bitcoin project. It was pretty good, but I think 21 coming into existence must have put teaching on the back burner. Understandable I guess.

If IoT devices are going to be loaded with Bitcoin, what's cheaper and easier: A Bitcoin mining ASIC that has to be able to generate enough bitcoin to make transactions on the network, or for each device to have either a NFC/Bluetooth/WiFi/or even QR code that you interact with one time to add it to the list of your machines with its bitcoin address included? It could even automatically add a device to your set of devices when it detects that you're in the area that you've defined as your home, making it similarly frictionless.
If every device in the future is going to be IoT enabled, then all it needs to do is run the software that lets it do things with Bitcoin. More than penny shavings will likely be required for any device that provides some sort to service as well.
We can think of real examples here too. So my fridge and my TV in the future will be able to make transactions with Bitcoin. Ordering $20 worth of groceries and paying $9.99 for Netflix on the TV is not something that's going to be able to be mined in any sort of efficient way from this type of mining device, even if there are twenty of them or more in a device. You'll end up paying more in electricity than you would simply by using your own bitcoin in the first place. All the estimates that people have run over the past year or so have not shown any math where the result is any thing close to break even. It's probably not a coincidence that 21 appears to have pivoted away from the whole consumer devices with mining chips idea.
If you have some examples where a device can provide utility with a few cents of bitcoin(which seems to be what its meant to generate) then I'd be happy to hear them.

Kind of. It's also harder to secure than gold is since it's information that gets stolen rather than metal. The fund properly storing large amounts of BTC in cold storage make delivery claims more of a security risk than sending gold which can be insured.
Not saying your wrong, but if their BTC is *truly* secure, and not in "cold but not really cold wallets" like Mt. Gox or every other disaster that's happened so far, the act of taking BTC out of secure cold storage should be somewhat of an event with strict protocols that need to be followed. And might cost more than people might suspect given how easy it normally is to send BTC around to each other.

It mines bitcoin with PoW, but I'm assuming what they mean here is closer to Hashcash style using PoW to assist with authentication. Not exactly the same as preventing email spam like I believe Hashcash was originally intended for, but in a similar vein at least.

The software sounds pretty good so far. Gating it behind a mining chip is disappointing though. Especially in a device that is clearly targeting existing Bitcoin developers. Even if the whole idea behind integrated mining consumer devices did make sense, the idea that the developers themselves who are expected to be the ones to create the products and services are forced to purchase a $400 machine to  do so is a confusing approach.
I understand that they're a business and they want to generate revenue. And I have no problem with that, but if this is the only way to do it then their business model seems broken from the start. If they want to licence the use of their software, then just do that. If people want to order the device with the miner because they've figured out a use case for it, then fine. But by default the idea that Bitcoin developers gain any utility from having a single ASIC included just doesn't make sense. Even as a prototype for other things, it just doesn't seem to be a good idea. All the good ideas so far are just 21 coming up with some documentation on how start using programmable money. That's awesome, but the beauty of the whole thing is that no specialized hardware is required. 
If the 21 mining pool shut down tomorrow, would any of the ideas they've laid out no longer work? Their CLI and microtransaction server don't rely on mining in anyway as far as I can tell so far, unless I've missed something here.
There's a cutoff point where consumer mining is so far away from being an efficient way to generate bitcoin that it's just not useful. That line was probably passed a while back. But I still be keeping my eyes open to see if someone comes up with a good idea on how to put something like this to use. I don't even care if people implement it or not, I'd to see at least some realistic use cases where there's demonstrable utility gained from the inclusion of a mining chip.

Of course that's the case with the mining. But him saying 'FWIW' and then listing those stats seem to imply to me that the point of the post was to say 'hey, look at how much 21's hashrate has raised since the release of the device!'. 
If he's saying that there's no way that 21 added enough miners to increase their share by 4%, then posting this is a very odd way to do it since it doesn't communicate that the most likely explanation is simply luck. You could say that its implied to anyone who understands mining, but why post it at all then? Especially considering not everyone is going to know how much luck can vary with mining. Something like 'FYI: 21's mining pool has mined some lucky blocks recently and their estimated short term hashrate is likely a gross over estimate which will regress eventually', would communicate that. But saying 'FWIW' implies to me that he's attempting to point out something positive, rather than something that's neutral and irrelevant(standard mining variance).

The answer to that is just that Bitcoin is more of an asset than something that's meant to be the 'one currency to rule them all' type of thing. It can be used as a currency and its flexibility adds utility, but it's really closer to something like gold.

They're arguing that in the context of Bitcoin as a replacement for other currency though, and that's not what it's been so far.
If you break it down, right now it's an asset with utility that has been designed to restrict supply in a predictable way in order to promote it's increase in value. It's just designed so that if there is demand for Bitcoin, then given that the supply is fixed, the value should go up, and it has. That's not something I would consider worthy of a Nobel Prize though.
If some state adopts Bitcoin over their own currency and they flourish because of it, and there's lots of data and evidence pointing to Bitcoin being the cause, then ok. Even if that doesn't happen, but Bitcoin continues to succeed independently, then maybe after a long enough time and research we gain some new insights in to economics, then maybe. But so far I think the amazing part of Bitcoin is just the invention its self, not the emission schedule. Especially considering there's a lot of unknowns in the future relating to the network keeping previous levels of security when faced with a declining block reward. The book on Bitcoin is just getting started the way I see it.

If you're correct and an Nvidia chipset of all things ends up out performing modern SHA256 ASICs at mining Bitcoin that would go against everything I've read about mining since 2012. For altcoins lots of people still mine with GPUs, but it's been over 2 years since GPUs have been viable for Bitcoin mining.

Not an easy question to answer of course, but I'm wondering if you know of anyone that's tried to get an estimate or something. Because people in this thread for example dismiss the issue as them being pools made up of miners who will move away and disperse if necessary. But all the pictures and articles I've seen about these massive Chinese mining operations seem to be at a scale beyond anything we've seen before, and the fact that they have access to extremely cheap government subsidized hydroelectric power makes it seem like it will be hard for individual miners to compete.

If Bitcoin fails because of some obvious retardation like BU/Jihan/Roger then I don't see why the utility of a decentralized cryptocurrency would suddenly lose all significant demand. Wouldn't it just be like whatever takes up that mantle just learns to avoid a similar situation? Or are you saying that these situations where the people ruin everything rather than the tech itself are just inevitable? Because I could see that. People ruin everything.

The most recent Bitcoin Core release resulted in a massive speed up of blockchain validation I believe. I think that was the bottleneck before that make getting the blockchain particularly slow. Of course downloading 60gb of blockchain can still take a while depending on your internet connection.

There's no sharing of private keys man. Read the thread. We're talking about sending a transaction to devices. You send a transaction to load the BTC on to the devices. One transaction with 50 outputs to load each device. 
Where did you get the idea that all the devices would have to share a single wallet?
edit: I see what happened. You must of confused me with someone elses post where they mentioned sharing private keys. My reply was based on the idea of sending transactions to devices, no sharing of private keys.

By testing, you mean on chain transactions right? Are you sending them in the standard way with a fee to be picked up and mined by the first miner that includes them in a block? Or are they broadcasted with out a fee and included in the next block that 21 mines itself?
If they're sent the standard way, thus far in your experience do you have an estimate of how long it takes to mine a standard tx fee?
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:26:43


Buying on Coinbase is friction but this isn't? And how long to you have to leave it running to mine enough just to pay the tx fee for a single transaction?
I'm not negative on the overall vision and what 21 are trying to do, but the mining part is the weakest link(while the software seems to be where the real value will be).

It would be nice if Coinbase could eventually open up this card to international users, but considering how much they seem to be under the thumb of regulators, I'm not holding my breath. If I was going to keep a stash of BTC to use on a debit with some third party, Coinbase would be one of my top choices since it's pretty unlikely they're ever going to pull a gox. So it would be nice to have that option.

Yes, I know that it's not about profit which is why I said it certainly doesn't have to have a positive ROI.
I see the opt-out vs opt-in angle. But there has to be a cut off where the premium that you pay for the mined BTC becomes too large to justify the expense. The lower the amount of required BTC for a device, the less important efficiency is, I understand that part. It's not a big deal if you pay 10 cents for 5 cents worth of BTC. But as soon as you start using real world examples of what type of utility these IoT devices are meant to provide people, it just gets worse and worse. If my laundry machine is going to purchase $20 worth of detergent for me, and my fridge is going to order $30 dollars worth of groceries, and I'm paying for HBO Go to watch Game of Thrones, suddenly the idea falls apart(given current mining conditions). And these are the type of things that are going to be at the forefront of the IoT. And if we're going to be loading those devices with bitcoin to pay for those things anyway, since generating enough to pay for those things doesn't appear to be very plausible, then we're back at square one. Mining just didn't work out the way 21 expected it to back in 2013 when these ideas were conceived. 
Also, the user experience of loading devices with bitcoin doesn't necessarily have to be particularly difficult at all. Given that these devices are able to communicate wirelessly, having a single button that loads your devices from your phone seems very doable.
The other possibility that people mention is that the devices only need to generate a few satoshis for use as some sort of communication medium between devices. Except the only way to use transactions in that way is to actually have them on chain. Sure, you can send off chain transactions with 21's microtransaction server, but if you're doing that you've effectively just created a complicated way to send information through a third party, where does the utility of 21 relaying this information to another device come in? If it was on chain then there might be some use, but the transaction fees required to get something included in a block pretty much makes the idea of blockchain-as-a-database a poor one. So, that leaves the final option of 21 including all transactions that are sent from their own devices for free. Ok, that can work, but even with 5% of the network you're waiting 20 blocks on average to have the transaction included in a block. Is there potential for that? I don't know, but we do know that it's limited to at most 1mb of those free transactions per block, which puts a hard limit on it even if someone comes up with some service that gains value from being able to include some free transactions on the chain a few times per day at most.

Yes to both and it's more about people just pakaging all the existing tech up and deploying it, as well as trying to set some industry standards. 'Blockchain tech' is more like a catchall code word for improving their existing systems. The end results of the blockchain tech hype train will probably result in very few systems that we would consider blockchains. Distributed ledger seems to slowly be replacing blockchain now though as a more accurate word to describe the things they're looking for.
I often say on here that if 'blockchain' wasn't the hot word in banking circles this year then we wouldn't even be hearing about this stuff in What they're doing really has virtually nothing to do with Bitcoin. Apparently some people just got inspired by Satoshi's invention and want to improve their own systems, but not in a way any Bitcoiner would consider in the spirit of Bitcoin itself.

Sustained economic growth over the past 100 years has brought the vast majority of humanity to an era of wealth and comfort never before seen. Even if humanities wealth is poorly distributed(as is Bitcoin as well), calling fiat a get-poor-slow scheme doesn't really make sense since it's common knowledge that there's a small targeted inflation rate. And in order to grow wealth it must be invested where it can return growth greater than inflation. That's kind of the whole point of it.

A lot can happen in 10 years but personally I disagree with that theory being particularly likely. There's a lot of room in the middle for Bitcoin to fit in and find its niche in the global financial system. It's doing that already and it's been 10 years.

If this is a true use-case/market then clearly selling 128gb microSD cards with the blockchain on it is something that will happen.
I do see the potential utility of wanting the blockchain now, rather than waiting to download it. However, if you have to have the storage media shipped to you anyway, it's quite possible that you would have downloaded the blockchain faster than the time it takes to receive a physical copy. Especially if we're talking about corporate internet pipes here. Plus the Bitcoin Core dev team just made some ridiculous efficiency improvement in validating the blockchain.

Except you're receiving payments from 21's mining pool. And if you don't want to link all of your devices to one address that means now you are the one who's going to have to do that 30-50 times with 30-50 accounts with 21.
@_date: 2015-11-17 16:40:12
The fact that the mining chip has become essentially an expensive authentication device is a bit silly though. And as of now that's exactly what it is, no one buying this thing would have trouble tossing 100k satoshis on it or something.
I get that the value of their device is the software, and that's great.  But it's too bad they may feel obligated to sell these chips that they developed because of how much time and money went in to developing them back in 2013 and 2014. Perhaps they feel an obligation to do so else their investors will feel like they've been duped, and partnerships with companies like Qualcomm seem meaningless for a company that is effectively a software company.
A16Z is linked to the famous "software is eating the world" quote, which makes it even more confusing. The irony is Balaji himself literally taught probably tens of thousands of people on his Stanford online course exactly how cool it was to build a software only Bitcoin project on any device that has a command line.
21's initial ideas during 2013 were not bad. They're not the only ones who underestimated the massive Bitcoin mining behemoth that is China. But the sooner they focus their resources on doing the stuff that matters, like continuing to make good software that's going to help people join the Bitcoin economy, the better imo. Clinging to the old ideas that they've already mostly pivoted away from is just chasing after an idea that has turned out to be not as good as it sounded in 2013.

Although I read that you needed the chip to use the 21 CLI and microstransactions server. That maybe true for the microtransaction server, but this post seems to indicate that you can use their software, or most of it at least, with no 21 chip.

Some technical award, or award for incredible invention, sure. Bitcoin is definitely a novel addition to the worlds economy because of the way it's designed from the ground up. It's possible that in the future with much more data and continued knowledge accumulated by humanity that we'll recognize that Satoshi's calibration of the economic variables in Bitcoin are worth an award. But at this point I think it's hard to justify. What knowledge have we gained thus far from Bitcoin that's enlightened humanity's understanding of economics?

It's probably inevitable, and sidechains give us a less painful way to bootstrap superior technology and transfer value over until the new chain decides it's too big for the nest and forks off on its own.
Better than some superior competitor swooping in and fighting an all out economic war with Bitcoin where people who have invested in BTC end up clinging on for dear life. At least this way psychologically people will feel that the successor(s?) to Bitcoin were naturally derived and there will be much less of an 'us vs them' mentality if the future tech incubates as a 2-way pegged sidechain first.

Yeah, I think if the value is there it's going to be in the software. And as of now the CLI and their micropayments server are only available to people who have the 21 mining chip. So it's effectively acting as a authentication device or licence.
They spent a lot of time and money developing their own silicon I'm sure, so they're probably going to do everything they can to make it so those millions spent on chip fabrication weren't in vain.
Wouldn't be surprised if they slowly pivot away from hardware in the next couple of years. It appears they made some big predictions and assumptions about how Bitcoin mining was going to go back in 2013 which turned out to be off the mark. We've all seen the leaked presentations over the years of what they originally intended to do. This device seems like a compromise to justify the hardware strategy.

It's the original idea behind Bitcoin mining basically. Satoshi adapted the concept invented by Adam. 
I think the original purpose was to use proof of work for each email sent thus attaching a small cost per message. Which if adopted widely would eliminate large scale spamming operations that indiscriminately blast as many emails as possible due to there being virtually no cost to do so.

Well Litecoin itself has already demonstrated that it's very possible for a non-Bitcoin PoW currency to have a substantial amount of network security from hashing.

The fact that some people think Bitcoin is more secure than a key signing arrangement that a bank or banks could arrange is insane.
5 guys in China came together to sign a cute message to the Bitcoin community that they supported BIP100 or something, and they represented the majority hash power on the network.

Don't forget that Amir spearheaded the drive to get Wikileaks to accept BTC for donations during a period where it was pretty controversial. With that we even had Satoshi specifically posting to voice his displeasure with that and his worry that it might attach the wrong kind of attention too early in Bitcoin's life cycle.
I don't think it would be fair to lay the blame on Gavin.  Or any one individual for that matter. It's pretty clear that even if Amir and Gavin hadn't spooked him he would have left anyway as things continued to heat up. A few months later we had a US Senator publicly speaking out against Silk Road. So at best Satoshi might have stuck around for a few more months. Bitcoin and Silk Road were a pretty hot topic in the mainstream media for a bit there back in 2011.

Maybe this is easier said than done, but what about each individual miner evaluating their own bandwidth and the network topology of their block propagation to set their own limit that maximizes their expected revenue?
That could be nonsense, it's just a thought. I was just thinking that theoretically there should be some optimal configuration for each miner. Maybe there are too many variables or unknowns though.
edit: This isn't BIP101 specific or anything, more curious about how things will look in the future since the block size will likely get raised at least a little eventually. It would be interesting if something simple like BIP102 happened and 2MB was the max and lots of miners were choosing to cap their own blocks at the old 1MB limit to avoid more orphans.

I agree that it doesn't improve efficiency overall, but Bitcoin itself should offer enough utility for people in general so that eventually banks and such will just consider it an asset like they do gold or silver. People will have the option to cut out the bank as the middleman, but I'm not so sure the majority of people would choose to do that if they had the option. Maybe I'm wrong though, we'll see. If the financial system started going down in flames or something then it would be a whole new ballgame for sure.

This is exactly the type of attitude I'm expecting most banks to take in the future. Eventually they'll want to offer their own services in Bitcoin. When it gets to the point that there's profit to be made from offering those services then there's no reason why they won't want to do so imo.

Personally I doubt the type of people who were biding on the auctions in general we're thinking about fungibility.
And the thing about Monero that a lot of people probably don't realize unless they've really looked in to it is that it has an *insanely* fast emission schedule, with something like  ~~60% or 70%~~(edit: see below for more accurate numbers) of the coins being mined in the first year alone. So whether or not it ends up being relevant or not still remains to be seen, but so many coins are being constantly sold by miners that it's not surprising that the market cap is small. I wouldn't even consider buying any for a while still, the emission schedule is just crazy. Maybe a year or two from now we'll see if it caught on or not.

If Bitcoin was the only way people could get CNY out of China the price would be way, way higher. In reality it's just one of many options. The 50k USD a year limit is not easy to enforce at all.

I'd say if Bitcoin was able to resist the Chinese government targeting it with some serious intent then we can say that it can't be censored. Right now I think we're still in a stage where a few major players could really do some damage if they felt the need to do so. Lucky for us so far there's been very little resistance and things are looking positive in general with very few governments taking an anti-Bitcoin stance.

I was thinking before that it kind of was like a similar model to Apple. How you need an Apple device to develop for their platforms. People probably have ways around it, but at least I think that's what Apple's intention is. That and $100 fee to register as a developer.
If their software is really good, I don't really object too much to them trying to monetize it. It's not easy to monetize open source software at all, so trying some alternative ways to do it is probably worth a shot. And even though many people are opposed to non-free software, I don't mind the idea of such a well funded company giving it a shot. There's lots of potential for some great software, and even if its not free, if it's worth it then people will pay. And if it's worth it that also implies that it's adding commerce to the Bitcoin economy so that benefits everyone.

That's true, but if you think of a corporation as a single entity it's not surprising that they might think something fully controlled by them is more secure. It's just a totally different definition of secure than what we would consider secure.

Something like Changetip or similar can accomplish the same thing. Loading multiple accounts might be annoying, but if there was just one or two that you could use for videos and such it would be a similar user experience, if not better since they could probably integrate single click payments or something. Whereas sending an actual BTC transaction is quite a few more steps.
I think it's going to be the things built on top of Bitcoin, like micropayment providers or sidechains that are going to provide the day to day type usage.
@_date: 2015-11-12 17:49:37
It should work out to roughly the same I think since the total amount of work done is similar. One 2.5 minute Litecoin block should be roughly one fourth as secure as a 10 minute Bitcoin block assuming all else equal(which it isn't of course in reality).

They have collected funds from people under the premise that at some later date Craig will have access to all of these funds and presumably pay them a hefty amount of profit. But of course Craig is not Satoshi and he has no such access. Unfortunately there are people who still believe him, and they appear to be continuing to run the scam with new twists and turns.

You seem to think that I'm taking a position that I'm not. I don't think there's any secret sauce. I think they made a big mistake investing in a path that lead them down the road of creating hardware related to Bitcoin. Regardless of that, there's still a team capable of producing some good software that can potentially provide some utility. I don't know if they can actually create a profitable business out of that though.
What I think will be interesting is if they are producing useful software that's open source, if they can figure out a way to monetize it. Or if it's going to be as you say a matter of months before it's replicated sufficiently by others. For anything that's not some enterprise level software that you can provide support for, actually making money off of open source software these days seems difficult. It would be nice if people can discover some new ways of funding through Bitcoin.

Do they though? Do you know of any research or even a survey that indicates this? I'm not saying you're wrong, as I wouldn't be surprised really if many people were that clueless. But on the other hand knowing that their money is intended to sustain a small 1-2% rate of inflation is a relatively simple fact that I'd imagine most people are going to be told at least once in their lives. 
And some times the price of something goes up simply due to a corporation maximizing its profit. So they're not necessarily wrong in some cases. But modern manufacturing and economies of scale have also bought down the prices of some things as well even when factoring in inflation.

So, is this MMM thing really pushing a lot of this Chinese volume? From the beginning I've been really skeptical that such an obvious scam would really result in such a massive influx of capital, but OKCoin really seems to be going out of their way here to send out these warnings.
I'm also puzzled why a scam like MMM would use Bitcoin at all. They don't control it of course, and wouldn't they make more money making their own shitty scam altcoin that they unload on people? I remember reading they did this before in one of the big MMM scams(before cryptocurrency though). They had their own 'currency' called the Mavro or something like that. Selling people Bitcoin just seems like it wouldn't be in their interest, unless the people are buying BTC and sending it all away to the scammers so that the scammers themselves can launder it(I guess that must be it? Still seems worse then them making their own currency).

People here keep saying that but when has there ever been any indication that any of these banks or other organizations have any interest in creating a token?
Every thing I've read related to blockchain technology is that they are mainly interested in the distributed data, multi-party cryptographic signing, immutability, and auditability aspects. It sounds like it's just an iterative step up from whatever current systems they use for data. I don't think anyone is making a PoW blockchain cryptocurrency with tokens. If they are then that would be big news, as it would have something to do with Bitcoin. 
Many people take the attitude here as 'these poor naive bankers don't know anything, they'll see soon enough that they'll need to use the one true blockchain of Bitcoin!'. Why is this attiude so prevalent here when there's no indication that any of these organizations want anything to do with cryptocurrency? And using the Bitcoin blockchain as a database makes little sense, especially when considering the cost of transactions and the fact that while we might value the decentralized aspect of it, most banks simply won't(unless it's a decentralized network between banks themselves).

Since 2013 GPUs have become obsolete mining for BTC. People still use them for some alts though that have 'ASIC resistant' algos.
The actual 21 device comes with its own ASIC that mines. It sounds like installing the software here on your RPi will give you access to the software tools, but mining on it is effectively not an option.

I think concerns about the economic model are valid, but as far as I'm concerned Bitcoin should stick with its original distribution schedule till the end. Even if it means failure. I want real world examples to compare. I think many other projects are going with different models and we'll have a good chance to see how it all plays out and everyone will learn a lot. If cryptocurrency is really going to become an important part of the global economy then it's still really early now and in the bigger picture I think the knowledge gained by different successes and failures is valuable.
It's not that you're necessarily wrong or anything, but we might end up having it both ways anyway. If PoS eventually turns out to be solid and viable someone will surely fork Bitcoin to PoS and then that chain can change the distribution schedule, while the original PoW Bitcoin chain will continue along as it always has. Everyone will have coins on both chains so if(and that's a big if) it proves economically and technically superior, no one loses out unless they immediately dump their coins or something like that.

It's just not great at consumer payments.
Not being sarcastic here, but I do feel bad for everyone who jumped in during the period where everyone was touting Bitcoin as something that was going to change the way people pay for things. It was a lot of bullshit, and a lot of misleading marketing. Misleading people has been a problem from day one though. Starting back when Bitcoin was the 'anonymous' payment system. There's no one particular person you a blame though, as it's the community as the whole that often allows lies and half-truths to flourish if they think it's going to help get people buying BTC.

Sucks that we have to be stuck with this public perception. There's lots of people who don't hold these views who are Bitcoin enthusiasts too.

There's nothing to worry about since these private blockchains are attempting to do something completely different than Bitcoin is. There's almost no relation between the two except a loose link on what exactly defines a blockchain.
If banks wanted to create their own cryptocurrency to compete with Bitcoin, then that would be more relevant. But for now all this blockchain tech stuff is a complete non-issue imo. I don't think that the banks are doing something stupid as many here seem to believe, it's just unrelated to decentralized p2p currency.

Here's what they say on the site: 


RootStock is a smart-contract peer-to-peer platform built on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain. It goal is to add Value and Functionality to the core Bitcoin network by the implementation of sophisticated smart contracts as a Sidechain.
So it seems it will be a sidechain. Them using the phrase 'built on top' sounds a bit confusing as I'd generally consider that to mean built on Bitcoin.

For microtrust situations when dealing with a few dollars it makes sense to use something offchain like Changetip. There should be services available for that with no AML/KYC. Even if Changetip being American gets pulled in to that, there's always something else that can fill in that market niche.
Maybe it would be nice if Bitcoin was better for microtransactions, but it's not. Accepting zero conf is already something that technically isn't trustless anyway. So replacing one small amount of trust with another isn't really changing too much.
I don't necessarily think Changetip will be the winner in that market, but there will likely be a microtransaction market with various services competing until one or two become ubiquitous. RBF or not I think it's going to happen because it just makes more sense for small amounts of money. I was paying 25c in fees not too long ago. Wanting to watch a video for a dollar and paying an extra 25c, or even 10c is pretty high percentage wise.

Yes, I know about how Willy was operated. But there are many people who think that the majority of the bubble was legitimate speculation from China. It's not as one sided as you seem to think. I don't doubt at all that Willy was buying, and that amount of buying definitely contributes to the overall support of the bubble, but the bot wasn't necessarily pushing new highs itself.
If someone posed the question: "What do you believe contributed more to the late 2013 bubble, Chinese speculation or the Willy bot on Gox?" I'd be surprised if more than 50% of people believed that Willy was the primary cause.
We're probably never going to know for sure, but since there are traders who claim that during this time their observations were that the Chinese exchanges were pushing the price up, it's unclear exactly what happened.

Yeah, the original MMM scam was huge. The fact that it's able to be reproduced is a bit ridiculous, but I can't say I'm shocked. I understand now that they're just using Bitcoin as a payment method as opposed to having the members buy Bitcoin for themselves as part of the scam.

That's a really good idea. Surprised that no exchange has implemented some simple operations like that. Like buy or sell x amount every specified period unless the price is over or under a target number.
Obviously people can easily do that with bots via the API. But it would be nice to have such an option available for the average trader who's not using the API.

Nah, it was way over $500 on the Chinese exchanges trading in yuan. They were setting the pace and the western markets were just following their lead.

But we seem to be at a point where the west is irrelevant, don't we? China is the one who moves the market. We could have all kinds of western media reporting and I'd imagine it would be nothing more than a soft breeze.
Honestly, what we really need is people who can translate whatever is going on on in China and the Chinese message boards/social media. None of what we do seems to matter at this point. We're literally a small fraction of the volume. And the only response we have to that is that the Chinese volume must be fake. Well, ok that may or may not be true to a certain extent. But as we just witnessed, China single handedly drove the price up well over $500 faster than anything we've seen in around 2 years.
Also, I wouldn't expect the whole fintech boom going on now to come back to the idea of using Bitcoin. If anything they're moving past the idea of using blockchains at all, and Bitcoin's blockchain was only the initial inspiration, but in the end what they build will not resemble a blockchain as we know it. They're already moving away from the word blockchain you'll notice. Permissioned ledger, distributed ledger are becoming more common, as they generally don't need a full fledged blockchain to do what it is they want to do. And they certainly haven't expressed any interest in cryptocurrency thus far either.
@_date: 2015-11-12 08:38:40
I don't think pump and dump would be the correct phrase to describe it. And I'm not sure how it will work out, but a couple of things to consider: From reading and listening to some of Andressen's public communications he seems invested in to Bitcoin on an emotional level(which I've been a bit surprised about). I've seen less from Horowitz, but from the little bit I've seen he seems to hold similar views. Also, Balaji Srinivasan is a partner at A16Z, and he's also the CEO and Co-founder of 21 Inc. So it's a home grown project attached to some big names in SV.
Another thing to consider that the original project was conceived back in 2013 during what was a Bitcoin mining bonanza, with ASICs just being introduced at the beginning of the year. Back then before the mining market settled into it's current state of mega-farm dominance, the idea that consumers might mine BTC on USB keys and such wasn't as far fetched, and in fact many people were doing so already with ASIC Miner's Block Eruptor. But it didn't take long to figure out that this path wasn't one that was going to work out, so they've pivoted probably multiple times. 
They also spent what was likely many millions developing custom silicon for Bitcoin mining. And the fundamental idea of the project was based around phrases like "A Bitcoin miner in every home". So you can see why after spending so much money on development of this idea they probably still feel obligated to see it to completion in at least some form. But at this point from what many people have observed the value of the product will come from the software stack that's included, not the hardware itself. Some people are predicting some sort of decentralized micropayment platform or something similar based on their marketing thus far. So now we are going to see what the software brings now that it's finally been released.

I'm sure there are some people who probably believe that Bitcoin should never ever do a hard fork, but I doubt that's the technical consensus.

Yeah, it would only work with major mining pools or groups of large mining pools. The more decentralized mining is the less any of this would work at all. Today for example it would only really work if say the big five Chinese miners together were open to creating these sorts of contracts. Also, this assumes that block space becomes somewhat scarce at least, and transaction fees more expensive than they are now.
It wasn't too long ago that the hard coded minimum fee in Electrum was 0.0002, which at one point was $0.25. It's not impossible that we see high fees again at some point, but it's more something to keep in mind for the future depending on how things shape up. But yeah, this is purely hypothetical and is probably not likely to happen. Interesting to think about though imo.
@_date: 2015-10-22 08:47:45

1,2, and 3 are alright for the most part I think. But 4 is a bit much. I wouldn't say that some of the situations where Bitcoin is currently free from regulation are only helpful for criminals. But I don't really want to argue about it either, so just take it as my personal observation. But I do think that as we can see in the US with companies like Coinbase and Gemini and such, the 'freedom' from regulation isn't necessarily something that's going to be sustainable or continue over time as Bitcoin and similar technologies become regulated.

Yes, but Bitcoin itself doesn't seem to be designed to handle the very high amount of transactions that one would normally associate with database usage.
I agree that it adds legitimacy though, yes. But there's also a potential downside of the database idea not being sound to begin with, and a legitimacy-adding organization like Fidelity switching to another system. The media could easily spin that in numerous negative ways like "Fidelity's Bitcoin experiment fails" or something worse. And we already know that they love to try take any shot at Bitcoin they can.

Hmm, I feel they get a decent amount of credit since they seem to be doing well so far as a company providing services to Coinbase and such. If anything people are uncomfortable with the idea of companies outsourcing their Bitcoin blockchain level operations like that(instead of running their own nodes and such).

It's just another one of the data points in how the Bitcoin economy affects the decentralization of Bitcoin itself.

Bitcoin journalism is abysmal and then you have Coinfire sitting there doing it right but I imagine they're badly in the red(I'd love to be told otherwise if that's not true though).

Bitcoin, or any decentralized system for that matter, is never going to out compete centralized finance on costs alone in the long run. Not sure why many people expected it to. There might be some short term advantages where Bitcoin can win on costs, but the market will certainly adapt to any inefficiency over time. The cost of moving data in a centralized database will just get cheaper and cheaper over time as things become more efficient and less bloated/less overhead.
Of course Bitcoin has it's own advantage of decentralization. That's where it competes. Not cost.

The question is whether it's fundamentally flawed in the sense that it always tends towards centralization due to the inherent incentives. Hopefully not, and hopefully there are some solutions. But it's certainly looking more and more like that as time goes on. Then it doesn't really matter if alternatives are more decentralized in the short run if it's just the same cycle over and and over again.
@_date: 2015-10-07 10:07:08
It's looking a lot more stable definitely. But we're going to really need a good amount more time before we can really start touting its relative stability. The Bitcoin market historically has been really over reactive and twitchy. If it's really changed we're going to need to see it during a time when we would have previously expected a lot of volatility.
@_date: 2015-11-27 12:20:31
Did you switch over to alts after that? I see that there's still a good amount of people with GPUs mining various 'ASIC resistant' coins. Etherum is probably the latest popular one. If they're just sitting there and your electricity isn't too expensive you should maybe consider setting them back up.
If motivation/tiredness is an issue you could also try looking in to modafinil or one of the related drugs. It's not an anti-depressant or anything, but it can help with the fatigue.

What is the alternative? Force people to relay all transactions? Or give them the choice?
It's censorship, but not in the sense that a third party is preventing anyone from information since you can always run software that doesn't filter. It's a personal choice to censor certain transactions.

There seems to be lots of possible reasons why Jihan does what he does, but Roger is...I don't know how to describe it without making a personal attack.

If that were the case, then it would explain everything. But for some reason I still get the impression that he's driven by irrational emotion rather than calculated greed. The stuff that he and seem to believe is just ridiculous. Like they can't even entertain the theory that people who are not them actually want to scale Bitcoin. They just don't and won't believe it.

My guess is that he's in big out of pocket to Craig and his group. I don't have direct evidence of this, but both him and JVP are acting as victims that are so deep in that they're turning into co-conspirators in some desperate attempt to hang on to the idea that Craig is really Satoshi, and that they'll be getting their rewards from that imaginary 'Tulip Trust'.
Time will hopefully continue to reveal the whole story. But everyone other than Gavin who is involved seems to have completely gone off the deep end. Whereas Gavin doesn't appear to be involved any more than just someone who made a large error in judgment and is just being used as a stepping stone in Craig's scam.

Bitcoin isn't really known to be great at true micropayments due to the fee. Right now it's somewhat low, but I've paid up to 25 cents per transaction using Electrum back when it had a forced minimum of 0.0002.
Around 3 cents is great for smaller transactions like 5 or 10 bucks, but anything sub-dollar and it's not particularly good percentage wise. Which why you see services like Changetip taking micropayments off chain, as for small amounts of money microtrust is fine. If people are just loading their wallets with 5 dollars then even in a worst case Gox type scenario the damage is going to be small.
You could try looking in to Changetip itself too since they posted on here a while back that they deal with USD balances now and users can use Paypal for small amounts. Obviously they're still associated with Bitcoin so that might be dead end for you because of your boss. I wonder if they have an API or something that someone can just use their system as a micropayment service but integrate it as their own platform. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 07:50:39


Uh, no. Considering how many alts have been released with premines the average is so far from 90% that I'm having trouble imagining where you could have gotten that number from. 
In reality when developers keep a premine it's normally 1 or 2%.

All I've been saying is that it's unclear exactly what happened. I certainly don't know anything for a fact.
I do hold the opinion that it's likely Chinese speculators are what drove the price in this recent mini-bubble to ~500. That's mainly from me observing the prices on OKCoin, Huobi, Bitfinex, and Bitstamp. I don't have any motive other than curiosity at what's actually happening. It's especially confusing because if it's truly the Chinese that are driving the market then we're pretty much in the dark. Other than knowing that some people have said that many Chinese just view speculating on Bitcoin as a form of gambling(which isn't inaccurate or anything).
I'd like to know the truth behind all of this and know exactly what's real and what's fake. And what the real situation is in China with people speculating on Bitcoin, but not being able to read Chinese makes even the most basic investigations close to impossible. So all I can do is look at the market and the blockchain for now and try to form an opinion.

As someone who's a 'Bitcoiner' and has been for a very long time, that post you replied to is filled with bullshit.
The answer to your question without all the misleading statements and lies is simply that as a consumer in the US in the vast majority of cases you would not benefit by using bitcoin. Especially if you as a consumer are comparing it to using a credit card(protection, cash back ect). It's not even close and it never has been. Anyone who ever thought or ever tried to pass off Bitcoin as a competitor in that area is misguided at best, and a conman at worst.
Perhaps in the future layers will be built on top of Bitcoin that enable consumers to use it in a way that makes it something to consider for the average consumer. But today is not that day, and it's not even close really. For someone who already has BTC and wants to buy something online or whatever like a game on Steam or something, it's a reasonable option sometimes. Still probably worse than someone who responsibly uses a credit card that takes advantages of rewards and such, but whatever we're not talking about a lot of money here and if you're using bitcoin on a regular basis on the web for a variety of reasons it's decent enough to use. I might use it that way, but I certainly don't think that this case is applicible to the average person. Nor should it be right now the way it is really. They'd probably end up losing their bitcoin through malware, phishing, hacking ect. That's just the way it is. Just like people get their credit card information stolen fairly often. Big difference here is that once your bitcoin is gone it's really gone. Whereas if something happens to your credit card and you wake up to $5000 worth of charges it takes one phone call and one signature to make those charges disappear and have a fresh new card shipped to you right away. 
For now Bitcoin is a unique, very secure system when used correctly that people are working on integrating into the global financial system. It has its uses as another tool in the financial tool box, like many other different financial products. For example it's a lot more interesting to people in China who have money but also happen to live under the thumb of an authoritarian 'communist' government than it is to your average person in the US. And unsurprisingly the volume of Bitcoin trading that goes on in China is multiple times higher than the US. Just ignore the charlatans trying to sell you something here. It's interesting, and imo pretty cool technology that adds a new degree of freedom in the global financial system, and it's always nice to have options and choice. One of the issues is that it tends to attract a lot of crazy people will get rich quick dreams who try to package it up as some bullshit that its not, sugarcoat it, and sell it to people like yourself. It's annoying, but I guess somethings never change and this situation comes up again and again every little while.

I seem to recall people losing BTC on hacked Android phones, but not iPhones.
Given that Apple has apparently been letting a ton of scam wallet apps through their security checks this isn't too surprising. The days of iOS being 'pretty safe' are probably over if they're not stopping malware apps from getting on the app store.

Yes, it causes more harm than good when people set false and unrealistic expectations about Bitcoin. Definitely agree with you on that point.
The problem is so many people think of Bitcoin as some kind of get rich quick scheme so they don't mind pushing half truths and lies if they think it'll help their investment in the short term. While there's undoubtedly been much more long term damage done by all the misinformation.

Not sure yet. Too many people seem to be concerned with the issue of the NDA it seems. It's all hearsay for now, but it's been discussed for a while now that Craig and his associates have been working their way around certain parts of the community. 
JVP even mentions a further way that they're likely to attempt to extract money in the Bitcoin Magazine article, by auctioning consultations with Ms. Nguyen who is supposed to be the trustee of the Tulip Trust I guess. 
There's still lots to figure out, and hopefully more people come forward soon. But based on everything I've read and people I've spoken with I think there's a very high probability that this is a major part of the scam. If no one comes forward, or no new information is revealed further sheding light on Craig and associates collecting money over the next year or so I'll gladly make a post saying I overreached in my use of language. I wouldn't be using such strong language unless I thought it was extremely probable. It lines up with what I've been listening to/observing for months now, so it's not like I just came up with this in the last few days since Craig went to the BBC et al.

I don't think anyone would seriously argue that Bitcoin's blockchain could be remotely as secure as a blockchain signed and secured by the richest private organizations on earth.
A simple two layered n of m system where one actor(say a bank) signs with its own key with its own multi-person n of m scheme, and then the actual blocks are signed on chain with multi-organization n of m(banks, financial service companies, whatever) is probably pretty secure. And I'm sure security experts would add layers upon layers of additional security.
The cost of attacking Bitcoin or any PoW is easily measured in either the cost of the electricity and technology needed. How do you even measure the cost of a physical, violent multi-pronged attack on the biggest financial centers in the world?
And even if you want to do an apples to apples comparison, in terms of how many people you would need to coerce to gain control, it's pretty obvious that attacking a few industrial mining farms out in remote China is laughable compared to obtaining multiple keys secured by banks around the world and such.

If the movie studio is the one who determines what a genuine copy for a movie is, then there's no need for the mining part since they can just cryptographically sign whatever it is they want to deem genuine.

I'm a big Bitcoin supporter but I don't think Bitcoin itself is going to(or should) have any part in this entirely separate (possible)'revolution' that the banks are starting now. 
Bitcoin and this private ledger stuff is just apples and oranges. I'm not sure why so many people here feel like Bitcoin needs to be center stage with this stuff. Take it as a compliment that people are recognizing the technology that Satoshi created and move on. Banks have shown no interest thus far in involving themselves with cryptocurrency, they're interested in distributed data. Bitcoin is a global cryptocurrency and the Bitcoin blockchain isn't going to become some giant database for the banks to exploit. If it started heading that way the market would be forced to raise fees to price out that type of usage anyway. It just doesn't make sense to do it on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is p2p money first and foremost, not a cheap way to store distributed data.
Maybe there will be one of those prediction markets where we can bet on how much Bitcoin itself will be used for these purposes. So many people here think banks and such are going 'wake up' or have some 'eureka!' moment where they decide that they want to store their data on the Bitcoin blockchain, and I think the chances of that happening are very low.

Trying to put on a show and convince people who clearly want nothing to do with Bitcoin is something that people should really consider not doing.
In what way would transferring someone some money to their phone impress them anyway? Do they not have a banking app on their phone or something?
Transferring money around is not what makes Bitcoin interesting, it's the decentralization. And that's meaningless to most people so there's no point in trying to convince those who have no interest in that kind of tech to begin with. You would need to show them something that directly provides a benefit for them. Being your own bank is definitely not that killer app that's going to get regular people interested in Bitcoin.

Wait? We'd almost certainly be on track to hard fork as well as have significantly lower transaction fees if certain bad actors didn't decide to block segwit from activation...***a year ago***.
What, you don't think Core's scaling roadmap from early 2016 is a real thing? Or what? Why are they being held back while we're sitting here talking about this in mid-2017? Obviously if Roger and Jihan actually gave a shit about anything other than their personal delusions we would have been in a great position by now with segwit observed and live for a year. And baring any unforeseen hiccups we'd very likely be looking at a hard fork now. But no.
I can not fathom how anyone seriously thinks that Jihan and Roger are anything but a cancer on Bitcoin.

Especially in a time where things such as backwards compatibility exist. Cryptocurrency is so flexible and the barrier to entry is very low, so there's very little technical resistance to change.


There are some pretty big developments on this front these days too. And the kicker is that it's likely some of the best privacy tools for Bitcoin itself will also be included(trustless CoinShuffle for example), giving Bitcoin users interested in privacy incentive to use such a wallet even if they hate alts. I don't want to mention any names until these type of things are released, but it could be interesting if people have a UI giving them choice and reduced fees with alternatives.

Was that a thing? I didn't know people feared that. I mainly remember reading concerns 
I thought the issue was more that a sidechain that's technologically superior to Bitcoin could eventually detach and fork away after using Bitcoin to bootstrap itself.

Not that there's anything wrong with technical progress imo. I'd love to see superior technology in action.

It appears to me at this point that it's literally the only way. Unless someone comes up with some middle out compression or something that wins them the Turing Prize.
I haven't heard any evidence that Ethereum or whatever else has solved on chain scaling while preserving decentralization. And if anything from what it sounds like a lot of these alternative blockchains like Ethereum would have an even harder time scaling than Bitcoin.
So I don't know why people are resistant to layer 2 solutions when the alternative is even more centralization in a system that's already in the red zone of centralization. Seems like kind of a no brainer to me.

@_date: 2017-05-01 13:50:51
I don't think it's anyones fault, it just seems that's how the incentive system is fated to work out with Bitcoin. Satoshi didn't even foresee mining pools, so I can't really blame him. It's a good idea and an interesting experiment regardless of how its turning out now. It was damn impressive to have around 50k nodes, many of them mining themselves with off the shelf Radeon cards in 2011/2012. It worked well, but obviously doesn't work out that way in the long run as we can see now. 
I don't think China the state had any foresight. Just the right recipe of money, engineers, chip fabrication access, ultra cheap government subsidized power and probably some other advantages too. It's not like the US or some other western nations disallow large mining farms, it's just that China does it better.
I'm crossing my fingers that something is going to happen in the next year or two to tip the scales back towards decentralization, but I don't know what that might be. Luckily there are lots of people who are smarter than I am working on Bitcoin, and I'm sure they want to get it back on the right track if they can.

Even if that's true on a lower level, it's irrelevant to the user experience of using a credit card. Where as long confirmation delays are just something we all have to deal with as Bitcoin users. It's not a very good user experience to deal with a transaction that relies on 1-6 confirmations taking an hour++.
Just because that's the way things are currently doesn't mean we should just grin and bare it. If people are creating new tech to improve the user experience of things then that's good. And I don't think peoples complaints should be dismissed either.

So when we discussed it last you mentioned that you were under the impression that it was pretty efficient and you were right.
I think a lot of people are underestimating the chip because we've been talking about 21 for a long time now and presume that the ASIC would be something they developed back then.

Which way are you seeing it though? If we fork out AsicBoost, the miners are getting what they want?
But everyone else wants to fork out AsicBoost anyway other than people who'll be able to make money from it. So I don't see how this settles much if everyone is on the same page to begin with.
Unless I'm wrong about people wanting to fork it out, and it's not high on everyone's hard fork wishlist like I'm assuming. Seems bad to give an advantage to those who are out of reach of silly western patent laws though. So I don't know why someone would want to keep it as an option if it's trivial to add on to the next hard fork.

Probably not very close because it sounds like that would be a one step direct party to party transaction, where as these services like purse and fold are third party middle men that require additional steps.

@_date: 2015-10-29 14:19:09
Yes, you're right. And I just want to add that in these sorts of situations traditional PoW mining is not relevant or useful and 'mining' can instead be done simply by signing blocks on an n of m system or similar. It's like a federated model, no need to waste electricity hashing for these types of blockchains. Each actor would only need to secure their private keys used for signing with an air gapped system that's physically secure, which should be very easy to do for a bank-type organization that already secures assets.
That being said, the idea behind this is not really related to Bitcoin in anyway and is not a decentralized currency, and there's no evidence that any banks or other organizations are interested in minting their own cryptocurrencies anyway. So while this 'blockchain tech' explosion is interesting, it's almost completely irrelevant to Bitcoin itself or other cryptocurrencies.

Have they come out and said that this will be available to the public? If so, that's good. I hadn't heard that yet. I assume the software is free. Do you know if it's also open source?
If this is how its going to be I think they really should have just presented like this from the start. Like 'Hey, we've built this neat software that we want people to use and we're making it available to all soon. And by the way we've also thrown a hardware package together for people who want their own dedicated hardware and don't want to/don't have the time to put together their own box.'. That would have been much better than this whole 'Bitcoin Computer' thing that seems to have just pissed people off, diminishing the fact that they might have created some useful decentralized software here if it's as good as some people are hoping it to be.

To your overall post, yes something like that could easily happen and make a huge splash in the global economy. To the quoted part, there would be no reason for them to spend any money on outsiders doing any mining/validation work as blocks can simply be signed by their own keys which can be securely kept offline on an air gapped system surrounded by the proper real life security measures that a bank would use guarding any sort of value.

The way it's structured though with its inflationary emission schedule makes it utterly dependent on demand in order to maintain its value though. So it really has to take something special to make it desireable in the first place, like some solid uses cases, and that has to happen first in order for it to maintain its value and act as a reliable store of value. That demand has to be generated first and foremost, or that value gets lost as miners secure the network.

How was 2013 sideways for a year? The spring time bubble was insane. I remember it being in the teens at the start and topping out at ~$266 before crashing down to around $50, but then strongly recovering in to the 100s. And then a few months later it was back up to $1200. Was a crazy year, anything but sideways imo.

Do the agencies keep the money? I thought the US Marshal passes the proceeds back to the Treasury or something similar. I'm not sure, but I think I remember reading something at a some point that mentioned that eventually seized money slowly gets processed and given to whatever part of the government handles the majority of the governments general funds. Which the agencies themselves get funded by of course, but the seizures are just a drop in the bucket and don't get directly funneled back to them(I think anyway, if someone has some more accurate sources feel free to post them).

It's an improvement on lower value transactions which generally don't use SWIFT. But as you scale up eventually SWIFT should be cheaper than Bitcoin in many cases since the fee is generally a fixed one around $30 or so. The transaction fee in Bitcoin is negligible, but the spread(+fees in some cases) of buying and/or selling for fiat is where the costs come in and magnify costs the higher the value of the transaction is. Which really puts a cap on large scale value transfer at least in the short term anyway. If liquidity gets better this also gets better, so we'll see how it progresses. So far it's improved a lot over the years, but it's not quite there yet.

They probably could extend that in to some form of DRM, but I don't think people will like that very much.

I'm seriously confused here. You honestly think that the vast majority of people don't want segwit? Have you seen how many companies are segwit ready or on board in general?
Who are these people that don't want segwit? From what I can see everyone wants segwit save for a small groupof  people who've gotten themselves knee deep in some bullshit conspiracy theory about Blockstream. And then there's Jihan, the person who's singlehandedly holding back segwit for reasons that only he knows for sure, but probably have to do with his perceived or real financial gain at the cost of everyone else.
But as far as the Bitcoin community at large not wanting segwit, I really don't understand how you could possibly perceive that as the case. Like it's not even close. Massive technical consensus. Massive business support. And yeah it's a bit harder to accurately measure user support, but can you give me some evidence at all that there's not massive user support? Because from what I'm seeing it's very clearly there and I don't see how you could think otherwise.

That's such utter bullshit man. Core is far bigger than what you've pegged it as. Not only is that not the reality, but even if it was it wouldn't really matter because if things were working properly the best solutions and the best technology is what would be used for Bitcoin, regardless of who or what it is. Don't think that the economic and technical community wouldn't be ready to call out that kind of bullshit if it was actually the reality.
UASF is fucked. Situation is fucked overall. No one wants to have to do this because UASF is la horrible situation to be in as it clearly demonstrates that the assumed incentives for miners are not as strong as expected. But Bitcoin as it is now is a total centralized joke unless things change. I doubt BIP 148 is going to actually happen, but if it does at least it would shut me up bit about how shitty and centralized Bitcoin is.

I don't think that's really the case. Especially seeing as how 'Core' consists of a wide range of people and opinions. 
Like we don't even know what's going to happen with the HK hard fork agreement, but we know there's all kinds of opinions and objections from different people involved in Core. There's certainly no 'Core party line' or anything like that.

Bitcoin already passed the 'big deal' threshold in 2013 imo. At this point it's already been in the mainstream media since early 2011.
If the halving gets noted all over mainstream media outlets, then that will just confirm that it's already here and everyone is keeping an eye on it.

371k BTC is a lot of money.
I remember it didn't take very long for him to get rid of them one way or the other though. I don't know if we ever got the full story, but he was claiming they were long gone for a while. And of course lots of people just assumed that he was saying that so he wouldn't be a target. But I think it's pretty clear he was telling the truth since someone with that amount of money wouldn't be pulling such stupid stunts for a measly $1m in BTC.

Like many people here I dislike this statistic without clarification on exactly what it represents. But I just want to throw in here that if this statistic was 2.7 million unique verified users I would be incredibly disappointed, as I would expect Bitcoin to be bigger than it is now if just Coinbase alone was catering to 2.7 million real people who use/used Bitcoin at one point.
My loose estimate for Bitcoin usage is closer to a million real people based on different estimations and usage stats, including the Federal Reserve's report before that estimated 400k users. It's just a rough estimation though so I'm not going to defend it or anything. Would be happy to hear any evidence that pointed to lower or higher numbers of actual people using Bitcoin. Since it's not an easy thing to really pin down.

Which is extremely expensive and labor intensive. And this seems to have resulted in some cognitive dissonance. No one wants to admit that their idea from 2013 didn't work out, and the existence of multiple ultra efficient mining farms has made consumer mining a thing of the past(mostly, people can still buy Antminers if they really want to and have access to cheap power).
How many millions of dollars did it take to develop their chip I wonder? It must suck to have to acknowledge the sunk cost and wasted time, but as a business they'll have no choice eventually.
Someone is going to have face reality at 21 and just focus on building software. All of their products that were leaked over the years obviously didn't work out due to the flaws that anyone with a calculator can find out. The idea just doesn't make sense in 2015(or 2014 for that matter either).

Many people believe so, but there are trade offs of course as there is with most things. Gavin's advocated for as high as 1 minute block times, while some point to Litecoin's 2.5 as a reasonable target. Some people I've spoken with like 5 minutes as a more conservative option, but I'm not an expert personally so I can only defer to others and try to listen to a wide range of opinions. 
The Bitcoin network is just so secure at this point too that one full confirmation at a 10 minute target is pretty secure, and a 'half as secure' one at 5 minutes still involves an incredible amount of hashing. And people do get tired of getting those bad luck transactions where you seemingly always end up getting stuck waiting 30 minutes to an hour for a confirmation. Selective memory of course, and it works both ways since it's just probability, but the negative cases stick out and diminish the user experience of Bitcoin.

And while it's hard to get a accurate survey of the whole user base, my impression is that people want segwit.

It sounds like no matter what kind of aggressive max block size increasing schedule you take it's unlikely to scale up enough to be competitive on its own in a global sense.
At this point, and especially now looking at it from the perspective of the chart, the only way there's likely going to be a competitive global payments system with Bitcoin is if it's done on some other layer. Although I don't really think Bitcoin needs to be some global payment system to begin with, but obviously a lot of people seem to have come in to this thing believing that's what the goal was from day one. The community rhetoric brushing off scaling questions for years makes it understandable why so many people thought they were signing up for something different though, so I wouldn't blame them really.

Many people seem to think Bitcoin will lead to some kind of eradication of existing financial tools and services for some reason. I don't understand the logic.

Unless this is a compete fork or something where people intend to develop their own unrelated system on their own. If it's not though then it still relies on the Ethereum project itself getting to a later stage of development, which seems to be up in the air at this point from what I've read.

There's two layers of centralization though too besides just nodes. The mining centralization that we have now is only going to get worse due to the fact that the Chinese miners are behind the Great Firewall keeping their p2p connections fine within the country, but hindered internationally which gives them a huge speed advantage of building off of each others' blocks. And the larger blocks get, the more of a propagation advantage they should have in theory.
Unless someone has figured out a solution to that issue anyway. In theory the government could probably give them some special situation where they are exempt from the firewall or something, but why would they do that?
@_date: 2015-10-12 21:58:06
Are we here even really expecting Bitcoin to disrupt finance though? In what way? Every thing I've seen points to them wanting things related to distributed data storage and such, and Bitcoin is not a good solution for that.
If anything, if things go well Bitcoin will just become a common asset that can be added to similar assets that they're familiar with already like gold, silver, oil ect. Just assimilate rather than disrupt. Bitcoin the technology just gives Bitcoin its value as an asset, it doesn't offer some magic answer for high volume distributed data storage. 
If you want to go out on a limb you could speculate that Blockstream or someone could build an entirely new piece of tech aimed at the financial market that's high performance and meets their needs, and then sidechain it to Bitcoin or something. But even that seems like a bit of a stretch when we're knee deep in dealing with our own issues of making sure Bitcoin has a solid basic technical foundation that's going to give the possibility of future growth with the network.

It will move out of reach as you say to some extent by enthusiasts supporting it, but it will effectively be dead economically. And that's all that matters with money in the end. Especially something like Bitcoin where its security is directly linked with its value.
I don't think everything is at the extreme end at all. All I was saying is that you need to design around the full range of possibilities. In general raising the blocksize not as simple as some people seem to believe it is. Especially when there's real code ready to go now that will provide an effective increase while also laying the groundwork towards systems that have the possibility to truly scale Bitcoin to international commerce levels. Raising the blocksize is just a dead end. Especially since Bitcoin is already a far too centralized failure more or less in its current state imo. Hopefully that will change, but it's already in a really bad spot and Bitcoin exists as it is now day to day at the whims of the Chinese government.
There's lots of great scaling technology that's ready today and more on deck. But it's being held back. There's not really much to say anymore when you have people deliberately impeding progress as a political play after screaming about the immediate need to scale. Scaling is there if people want it. And I bet the vast majority of people do want to continue on the roadmap. But Bitcoin is centralized enough right that a handful of people can stall progress, at least for now. These days are the real test of whether irrationality closes the book on this experiment, or whether people will be able to organize in such way where the bad actors get pushed out.

Outside of the US p2p transfers to domestic banks are often instant. In the picture here it's using UK pounds so it's very likely instant since UK banks offer instant free p2p transactions.
Sometimes in other countries I've found there can be small fees when sending instant transfers, but I think it really depends on the bank.

Creating a similar user experience without the devices mining does not sound particularly difficult. Especially in a scenario where all of these devices will be easy to communicate with over the air.
Even if we completely disregard the inefficiency of mining(ie as mentioned else ware paying $20 for your $9.99 Netflix subscription), this simple user experience where you don't have to fund your own devices implies that each device will be able to mine a sufficient amount of bitcoin to fund itself and province whatever utility its expected to provide. It's been a little while since people here have broken out the estimates of what these consumer mining chips are able to generate, but since it's been discussed here I haven't seen a solid realistic estimate of a device realistically generating enough money to order some household products, food, or entertainment. With enough chips yeah, you could scale it up to the point that you're generating dollars and not just cents, but that has its own issues. That might be fine for half the year in cold climates. And I think I saw some Danish company that is putting servers that generate heat in peoples homes, and that could work too, so the general idea isn't completely with out merit or anything. But at the scale and ubiquity that 21 seems to be envisioning it doesn't mesh with the reality of how Bitcoin mining has evolved.

Wow, is this actually going to be forked away from Etherum and developed separately as its own code base?
If so that's kind of amazing as I had assumed before that they were just going to be shadowing Ethereum's development and implementing the results in their Bitcoin version. Not actually take their own road from here. That actually makes them not reliant on Ethereum's funding issues to be resolved, so that takes the vast majority of the risk off the project since they can just develop independently.
I guess I wrongly assumed they had just done an implementation of Ethereum's stuff just like Counterparty did a while back(that caused quite a stir and some drama as well).

Bitcoin is money supply inflationary for a long while still. It's possible that SDR would have lower money supply inflation than Bitcoin for a while too. If it's on a transparent blockchain then it would be easy to compare. Marketing wise it would kind of suck to have Bitcoin known as the currency that's money supply inflates at a higher rate than SDR.
Unless its even worse and SDR can't be inflated by 'printing'. If it's actually backed and redeemable for the currencies contained in the basket then that's a bit different. Then we would have to break it down by the proportional money supply inflation for each currency.

Bitcoin and 'blockchain tech'/distributed/permissoned ledgers are just different things for different purposes and if it weren't for the adoption of the word 'blockchain' we wouldn't even be talking about them now.
Financial companies want to improve their efficiency, reliability, auditability ect. And some of them want to use some form of tech that at the very least is inspired by a blockchain. But so far none of these organizations have come out and said they are interested in creating a cryptocurrency. So in that sense there's no competition because Bitcoin and all this fintech stuff is just in a totally different category.
@_date: 2015-10-13 18:49:27
What do we do if that doesn't happen though? What's the time frame window of 'success'. I know most would agree that Bitcoin is already a success and has reached far higher prices and achived much wider adoption than many, many people thought(and I would agree), but there's definitely a lot of people now waiting for next phase above this one and it's going to take a huge amount of demand. 
If that demand doesn't come in 3, 4, 5 years is there any sort of plan B to increase demand? Are sidechains and the tech that will come with them that plan B?

Agreed. Poloniex is by far the best run alt exchange in my experience. It's good to see that they've grown a lot recently too.

Of course. It's just the same shit as XT, Classic, BU. 
The thing I'm worried about is that the vast majority of people and companies who support it, or have 'signed on' don't actually realize what this is. 
If they truly think that the large group of people who contribute to Core are not capable or unwilling to scale Bitcoin, and they are willing to ostracize the best group of Bitcoin experts in the world, then I want to hear them say that specifically. Because for now it looks like people have no idea what this actually is and what they're giving up.
Everyone knows that Bitcoin in its current state is unacceptably centralized(I hope). Choosing to go with segwit2x is essentially going all in on that centralized Bitcoin and consolidating and furthering the current centralization. At this point think I understand why Jihan wants that, but I can't wrap my head around how anyone else could want that.

Tell that to everyone who bought in the last 1.5 years. It's not very nice to point at the early adopters who got rich and say it's a great store of value because this small subset of the community is up money.
Over time though if we continue in this lower volatility 230-250 range then eventually time will heal those wounds and people will have to concede that it's a relatively stable store of value assuming it can keep up with the 0-2% USD inflation or whatever it's been forever now. If the demand is there it shouldn't be a problem, but we have to continue working on building the Bitcoin economy and producing value.

Lower barriers to entry spreads it out more, which can be a good thing if there's enough compensation to ensure good journalists can do their jobs.

I haven't seen any evidence that any sort of consumer mining makes sense on any product other than a heater in cold climates, but if I had to choose between mining dominated by China like it is now, and mining dominated by 21, I'd choose 21. 
I realize that both options are not good, but on the other hand I think the Chinese government is the biggest existential threat to Bitcoin.
I would really like to see some rough quantitative estimates though where it's going to make sense for any consumer device to mine. It certainly doesn't have to have a positive ROI, but is it also realistic for your $9.99 Netflix subscription to cost you $15 or $20 dollars now because your TV is mining it for you? If that is a gross over estimate, then that's fine too, anyone reading this can let me know if that's the case. 
If the reality is that 21's chips or even future chips are going to be able to convert electricity at a rate even close to break even that would be great. But given what consumer kWh rates are across the western world, and given that Chinese miners have been reported to be paying rates that are more than 10 times cheaper than standard consumer rates, how does this ever make sense?
If 21 has their internal estimates of power cost across the world and lists of examples where consumer device mining make perfect sense then *please* just dump a bunch of numbers on us and shut everyone in this sub up. I've been struggling to find any plausible examples of how this is going to work despite ideologically being behind 21's vision(from what I've gathered at least from reading their site, listening to Balaji's talks and such, and their slack).

Somehow this group of people who are primarily, and fundamentally against 'Core the project'(as nebulous as such a thing even is), and are so because they literally believe that people involved are lying about wanting to scale Bitcoin, have managed to package up their opinion there(which is of course a complete load of shit), as pass it off as 'big blockers' vs 'small blockers'. It's not even that. It's simply people who support Core and want to get started on the goddamn road map that was released *over a year ago* vs people who think it's a conspiracy and that somehow the open source project itself is playing out as a lie(wtf???).
This whole thing is seriously retarded. And I can-not-fucking-believe that someone like Barry Silbert thinks that the Core conspiracy theory side is in anyway a valid entity to be negotiated with.

No proof or anything, no. But this has been talked about for a while now among people. That Craig had been contacting people within the Bitcoin community and some notable people were falling into the scam. NDAs were signed and a 'big reveal' was to come. 
There was even a front page post on this sub a while back that tried to warn people not to get pulled in to the scam going on by Craig's group.
So no evidence, but just the fact that people were certainly discussing this situation before yesterday. So it didn't just come out of nowhere.

This must be a key element in the money scam I brought up in an earlier post today: 
Some people have probably been taken huge here and are expecting some kind of return. They don't want to admit they've been scammed out of their BTC.
My money is on Matonis, NewLiberty, and Ian Grigg being some of the whales that were feeding Craig's scam group. People have known that Craig was running this scam for months now. Reading the way NewLiberty talks about this just screams delusional victim. And now he's being strung along in the classic way. Now Craig is off the hook until 'September 19th'. 
But they're going for more money in the scam by 'auctioning consultations with her', the one who's supposed to hold the(obviously fictional) trust?

This type of stuff is rough, since it works pretty well and there's very little cost to attempting it. I hope there aren't people reading this thread with lightbulbs going off in their head. 
This and the bitlocker virus are pretty brutal. Nothing can be done really except hoping less and less people pay up over time thus making it less profitable for the thieves.
Eventually there might be some sort of public service announcement directed towards normal people telling them they should avoid giving in to Bitcoin extortion and blackmailing attempts. Hopefully it doesn't get worse over time. Although I fear it will.

I disagree that people are using 'blockchain tech' as a euphemism for Bitcoin. As far as I know there's been zero evidence that any of this blockchain stuff has any relation to cryptocurrency at all. I haven't seen a single mention of any bank or organization saying that they want to issue their own cryptocurrency. Everything is pointing towards them wanting distributed data storage and distributed consensus technology that is unrelated to Bitcoin.
It's apples and oranges. Bitcoin is a p2p cryptocurrency, if someone posts some info about a bank wanting to issue their own cryptocurrency at some point then that will be interesting. Other than that this whole thing is almost completely irrelevant to us other than giving a bit of free publicity when people credit Bitcoin for being the first technology to successfully apply the idea.

Since they were the ones selling the BTC in this case that would mean they ended up with fiat, which wouldn't have been able to cash out that quick.
If it was reversed and they ended up with BTC then that could be an issue. My guess is that they'd give them a negative account balance and contact them to explain the situation.

I agree. I can't believe after all these months so many people here still seem to be clinging on to that idea. Also, the fact that some of these people even think that these blockchains are going to be secured by PoW really demonstrates that they haven't the slightest clue what they're even talking about regarding what these banks and organizations are looking for.
Bitcoin is just an entirely different system and cryptocurrency has nothing to do with all this blockchain tech stuff.

Consumer version of what though? As of now the all the chip is doing is acting as an expensive authentication device to let people use the 21 CLI and microtransaction server.

It's actually a bit troubling that Bitcoin isn't already in use at a large scale within that industry. Is it a PR problem? People think it's too complicated? Security issues?
I'm pretty skeptical in general about Bitcoin being useful all over the place for your average joe. But there are some solid use cases like this seems to be. Ideally there would be some sort of liaison organization to help them integrate Bitcoin into their own economy, or something similar since it doesn't look like it's getting much attention there yet.

Yeah, that is pretty bad but almost seems obvious in retrospect. Not man people really believed that Bitcoin was designed in a way that would tend towards centralization of this scale.
Not really sure how it's ever going to get better. Even PoW change is just a temporary fix. The incentives are still aligned in the way you point out there.
The only way I can think of at the moment that might help resist that inherent push towards centralization is if the market itself flat out rejected miners becoming too centralized. But I know that doesn't and hasn't happened, and I can't realistically expect it to ever happen in the future unless there's some sort of modern enlightenment where the market wakes up and starts acting more rational.
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:49:32


Because that's a *much* harder problem to solve. Extremely important though. But what can we really do if it's simply turned out that the incentives in Bitcoin are aligned this way? 
Well there are some things we can do that might work for the short to medium term. But solving the fundamental issue seems hard.

Anyone who wants to try to force a hard fork ahead of schedule is essentially saying they reject the expert opinion and scaling roadmap of Core and the Bitcoin technical community at large. 
It's disapointing to see that people in the community think that this is really some kind of debate rather than strictly political wrangling from Roger.
Roger and co want a hard fork and a new implementation of Bitcoin because *they think Core has evil ulterior motives and do not believe that the project as a whole and particularly people who work for Blockstream want to scale Bitcoin*. It's as simple as that. By acknowledging these idiots as a 'side' or anything like that you're essentially endorsing these ideas as plausible at the very least. When in reality the whole premise is absolutely fucking ridiculous. 
No reasonable people in Bitcoin believe in that garbage. So I'm scratching my head wondering why anyone is talking about anything other than a UASF. As long as Jihan is going to be playing his own game with his own motives I don't see that there's really any other choice.

There were tons of regular people with mining rigs. Hell, people with a single 5xxx series ATI card were quite viable for a long time back in 2011 and 2012. Mining was absolutely more decentralized back then in the GPU days. PoW tends towards centralization due to economies of scale.

Hypothetical but relevant question: If someone flicked a switch and suddenly every PoS terminal in the world accepted BTC as a form of payment(in a way that wouldn't require additional training for cashiers), what would the result of that be?

I'm not sure if you're trying to make a specific reference to ZK cryptography here, but if you mean zero knowledge in a standard common language sense, then ring signatures don't result in there not being any knowledge related to the transaction publicly available. From what I understand you're still left with a set of possible receivers defined by the amount of mixins you use. So a mixin of 1 would be pretty bad and leave a lot of information.
I could be wrong, but that's how the CN ring sigs were explained to me.
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:56:37
Not sure if we're on the same page here, but I was referring to segwit and the Core scaling roadmap. 
There will probably be a hard fork eventually with it yeah. But it will be a good one for sure with multiple upgrades and lots of planning. So personally I wouldn't expect bitcoin to lose value, the opposite really.

But if it is as simple as locking up x certain amount of BTC and then doing this, why is it only coming up now? Not saying you're wrong or anything, just that this has been an issue for a long while so if the solution is this simple I'd be a bit surprised.

Lots of people who were around early sold off way, way back. The idea of BTC even hitting $100 as quickly as it did wasn't exactly common sense back then among people who took a skeptical but interested approach to Bitcoin. Of course there were always hoarders and fanatics too who stashed a bunch of BTC and were duly rewarded for their dedication. The idea that there was still lots of time to accumulate BTC going into 2013 was common. Then 'oops, holy shit it just passed $100 per BTC' happened.
Also lots of great people lost coins one way or the other. Either through scams, hacks, or just human error. It's actually incredibly sad how many good, smart, technically competent people have accidentally lost what would have turned out to be millions of dollars through losing access to their keys.

Not sure how you can decentralise it when you'd need to deal with a default through the proper legal channels.
I mean it might be a profitable business for someone to start a company that kickstarts peoples home loans or something, but they would just be a middleman that handles all the legal arrangements and takes money off the top.
There are a few other major issues I can see with it too like how they need to compete with traditional lenders by offering similar or better rates, but also need to make sure they're loaning to quality applicants. If it's just regular people looking at someone's 'lets crowdfund my home!' page I'm not sure that the crowd is going to be better at determining profitable loans than professionals with access to tools and experience.
Personal loans crowdfunding works because banks don't easily give out those types of loans. So people can use prosper or similar to make arrangements to crowdfund a loan that they can't get otherwise. But home loans are not difficult to get for qualified seekers and there's a huge competitive market out there already. So if the people who need crowdfunding for their home loan are just needing it because they can't find a loan through traditional channels, then there's probably a good reason why they can't find one, and the crowdfunders funding people rejected for traditional mortgages are probably going to have a bad time.

There's certainly lots of people in the world capable of doing such development at a similar level, but the question is how much time does it take for a capable person to get to whatever the minimum acceptable level of knowledge is to operate effectively in that position?
I don't know the answer to that question, but just thinking of how many years the Core devs have spent knee deep in the Bitcoin code base and associated crypto topics makes me think they've developed a pretty specialized skill set. Not saying that other people can't get to a similar level or anything, but ideally it would be nice to know that there was set of people who are "on deck" so to speak, who are willing and capable of providing the same level of commitment and hopefully able to obtain similar levels of competency.

What value does Bitcoin get by having companies try to use it as a distributed database?
Doing the math on potential fees from millions of transactions and it doesn't seem like much at all. And we know we're not going to be able to handle billions in a short period any time soon(at least on the main chain). Not to mention the bloat from billions of data storage transactions would be significant. 
If the fees raise to compensate, that kind of sucks for the people who want to use Bitcoin as p2p money. Also, if the market rejects people using Bitcoin-as-a-database by raising fees high enough that it's no longer economical to use it in that way, then they're just back at square one. But if the fees stay low then it seems more like a tragedy of the commons scenario where organizations exploit the blockchain for data storage as opposed to p2p payments.

People appointed to do so by the bank or whatever institutions are involved. Probably a full time job that would be under very high scrutiny and physical security.
Or maybe a group of people doing so with an n of m setup would be better. Actually, yeah that would definitely be better than a single person per institution. So I guess blocks would be signed of n of m institutions, and each institution(assuming there's more than one) could also of their own local n of m setup to sign with their key.
If anyone could establish a secure system like this it's got to be a private bank, or a government organization. I'd guess that a private bank could probably do better than a government though with regard to securing things of value(in this case a private key).

Not if it requires government level resources to mine and run nodes. Not if governments at that point decide its in their best interest to force people to use the money controlled by them, as they do now with fiat.
By going the 'scale at all costs' route, in this scenario you've surrendered your ability to just fork away. You'll be trapped economically and technically. Sure you could fork something and start a blockchain from scratch like altcoins do everyday and try your luck...maybe. That is if the governments of the world would even allow such a thing in a world where they already control 'the' blockchain.
Also you have to understand that 'coding for failure' as you put it is a fundamental part of building a system in an adversarial environment. The irony of all of this is that what Core is doing is actually 'coding for success' by attempting to preserve the single most important attribute of Bitcoin, which is of course decentralization. Coding for failure is ignoring all the dangers and risks in pursuit of some idealized vision that's not based in reality.
A centralized Bitcoin and the end of fiat would likely be a worse scenario than what we have now. Can you imagine having all of your transactions completely transparent on a blockchain that was run and secured by government(s)? And the regulations and laws that would come with that? Yikes. 
I don't know if you've developed this opinion because you think it's more likely to make you rich, or you've just been mislead by some bad actors in the community, but I hope you understand just how dangerous this type of approach is for a project like Bitcoin.

These kinds of scams are so common around the world now and MLM is a thriving massive industry worldwide which some quick googling seems to indicate is apparently now in the hundreds of billions of dollars in sales and revenue. I was just going to say tens of millions since there are publically listed MLM companies in the US reporting those types of figures I believe, not sure if those quick googled figures over 100 billion are actually true but given the figures in the US and the worldwide popularity it seems plausible.

Yes, I've actually wanted to bring this up at one point since no one seems to think about the bigger picture with 'security'. But theoretically I think a major bank could easily create a more secure blockchain if they wanted to. Distributed around the world in highly secure guarded buildings that adhere to a proper security protocol should in theory be completely safe if done right. 
Where as on the other hand attacking Bitcoin with say a &gt;50% attack is simply a matter of having enough resources to do so and can be quantified. It's a very expensive attack, but we could easily arrive at some realistic numbers. Where as what kind of armed multi-pronged attack in major financial cities around the world would it take to attack a bank secured blockchain? How do you even begin to quantify that especially considering that if some literal violent attack happened, state security forces would add to the defense if need be.
So for now Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain in the world by far, but a distributed blockchain protected by some of the most powerful organizations on earth could easily be effectively more secure, but in a different way. And this isn't even touching on things like the fact that something like 60% of the mining on the Bitcoin network is done in a country with a single party, authoritarian government with the power to do whatever they deem necessary on a whim.

Yes, but it's two different types of inflation in this case. There is low price inflation for the USD, 0-2% or so. And there is currently around 9% monetary base inflation for BTC right now and the amount of price inflation depends on the period your looking at. 2014 had massive price hyperinflation for BTC, but I don't think 2015 is nearly as bad so far. Not sure on the exact numbers off the top of my head.

It's doesn't necessarily have to be private. A group of banks could issue their own cryptocurrency if they wanted to and it would be vastly more secure than Bitcoin's blockchain as long as they followed some basic security like I outlined.
Take the members of that R3CEV group, make a blockchain where each block is signed by n of m members of that group, and there you go.
Not that I expect them to actually do that. But people talk about Bitcoin like it's the end all be all of secure blockchains. It might be true for now and I'm not saying it's not the best thing we have right now, but there are so many different potential future configurations that can easily be more secure then a few guys in China with their mining farms.

Avalon was. But people also thought Butterfly Labs was going to actually be something other than a shitshow, and they were American.
Some people were mining with GPUs for a while still even after Avalon started shipping the first ASICs. It's just that after that bubble where BTC went to $265 or whatever and then back down to $50 that seemed to ignite the mining race and the difficulty just kept exploding that summer from what I remember and then of course after the next bubble shortly after it was truly game over for anyone but China. A lot of people were seriously predicting things like a linear increase way back and started businesses around that assumption(and obviously failed if it relied on difficulty rising predictably linearly steady).

Yes, but that small percentage controls a lot of the wealth of the world and that obligation ends up being a very large amount of money. So there's some baseline level of demand there that does give it a *sort* of 'backing'. It's completely different than the concept of being backed by gold, but when people rattle off the line about it being 'backed by nothing', it seems a bit disingenuous. They might be technically correct that it's not backed by any physical good like gold, but simplifying it to 'nothing' seems like a weak argument and oversimplification. Not saying you are saying this specifically, but people in general(especially on this sub) often repeat similar things.
@_date: 2015-10-06 19:42:11
Some of those are social incentives, ok if you believe that Bitcoin itself can incentivize people to sell fiat and buy bitcoin to use for consumer purchasing because of some subjective quality I'm not going to argue. That hasn't been my experience, but it's a big world and people are different.
There shouldn't be any financial risk by exposing your credit card to merchants since your supposed to be protected from fraud when you use your card. I had it happen to me personally and it was a minor inconvenience at best.
Some of the other reasons you mention are where you already have BTC in hand, so those wouldn't be a case of fiat being dumped for bitcoin.
Merchant offering discounts for BTC is a good one that could work if we see it happen. It would have to outweigh the cost of converting the fiat to bitcoin which is a bit of an issue, but with a big enough discount it could work. I would have liked to see more of that so far with all the vendors who have been accepting BTC for a while now.

Don't be too sad. Lots of people sold massive amounts when it hit $1, or $10. Taking a 100x-1000x gain on a technology that was still experimental doesn't sound so crazy. The idea that everyone who could have bought BTC back then would have also held it through thick and thin over the years is mostly just wishful thinking imo. You really would have had to set aside a specific amount of money to buy x amount of BTC then throw it in cold storage with the express intent never to sell it and absolutely be willing to lose 100% of the fiat you bought in with. Great for the people who did that and get their deserved rewards, but it wasn't common at all.

After the hard fork, what are people expecting to happen to Core and the people who support Core's scaling roadmap? That everyone just moves over to this new implementation and life goes on with Core as a dead project and all the talent funneled in to whatever the new project ends up with as a name, and all the people who think the Core project is Bitcoin's best chance are just going to shrug and go along?
This is the tipping point for Bitcoin centralization imo. I hope people really think it through here before making their choice. Lose Core and get 2mb and segwit? Doesn't seem like a sound strategy to me given the work that's been done by Core already. I actually understand why businesses think that this is going to help them, but I think they're making a grave mistake.
If anything, businesses should be furious at the miners for holding back segwit to use as a bargaining chip. But now it seems people are just lining up to support their plans consolidate mining power in China.

Why should they be scared of Bitcoin? If Bitcoin grows and becomes an asset in the same category as gold and silver then it's just going to be more profits for them. More ETFs, more institutional brokers, more fees for whatever Bitcoin financial services they'll offer and related financial instruments and derivatives. 
If Bitcoin grows to the size where it matters enough that they can make money off of it then I'm sure they'll be adding it in the mix just as they would any other asset. That's what they do.

I think a lot of people have finally realized that Bitcoin isn't going to compete in the consumer market at this point. There's no incentive like there with credit cards that offer fraud protection and rewards. The whole drive for the consumer market in 2014 was futile to say the least. How many millions were wasted on that?
So far the only consumer use case that makes any sense and seems to have gained some traction is purse.io. I'm honestly not sure how legitimate it is or how sustainable it is though. So far it still exists though and I was very skeptical of it when I first saw their model, so I guess now I'm slightly less skeptical but still cautious. I wouldn't use it myself yet because I'd be afraid of receiving goods bought with a stolen card, but I think they have some 5% thing that they provide themselves or something. I might try the 5% one day, not sure.

Yes, plus storing your BTC private keys is effectively the same thing has going and digging a hole somewhere and burying some money and/or gold. If they know that you're withholding money or evading taxes they'll still try to collect. If anything Bitcoin is worse for that since it's a public ledger. I don't really see where BTC removes a states' ability to tax.
@_date: 2015-11-20 16:44:09
There's tons of interesting implications from this too. I can imagine scenarios where a group of people form a syndicate to make contracts with the large miners where they prioritize their transactions for a set amount of time, say 2 years or something. The miners might be interested in it because they could receive a lump sum payment up front which they can then reinvest into their mining operation, rather than have the income spread out over x years.
Maybe some of the first smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain will be these types of deals with miners. 
Also, this topic is relevant to 21 and their devices, since I believe they will be including transactions sent from their devices for free. So if a lot of autonomous 21 chip enabled devices are sending zero fee transactions that only get picked up and included by 21, it's quite possible that 21's blocks will be filled entirely by these transactions. 
So this is major mining pool transaction prioritization stuff is already happening and will probably continue to take shape over the next year. I'm really curious what it will look like this time next year. Not sure whether it's good or bad, but if I had a business that relied on sending bulk on chain transactions I'd definitely be exploring the possibility of making deals directly with miners to ensure that my transactions would be included in the years to come.
edit: Another idea: You could buy a large amount of transactions in advance with an up front payment and then sell them to people for profit. Imagine some Bitcoin tycoon making a deal with all the big Chinese miners to buy millions of transactions that the miners are contractually obligated to include in their blocks.

I think you underestimate the ignorance of the people who apparently signed off on their support for 'segwit2x'. I'd be surprised if more than 10% of the people who signed on for that have any idea what they're actually signing up for.
It's just the whole Bitcoin Classic strategy all over again, trying to blitzkrieg a hard fork in a ridiculously short time period, while misleading a bunch of people to think that what they're agreeing to is 'Bitcoin is going to continue on exactly how it is now but a simple variable will be changed'.  
Too many people don't understand, don't care, think following some bullshit artists will make them more money. That's the Bitcoin market(imo).

For now given information such as this:  it appears the people who have likely given money to Craig are now being strung along to a later date, that being September 19. Part of the problem with getting some specific evidence is that people who have been scammed aren't likely to admit yet, since they probably believe there's still a chance that they'll get whatever they were promised. Hopefully someone will step up though to stop this. As this quote:


implies that they are still collecting money, or at least attempting to.

This is a big one that many people here miss too. Personally I'm a Bitcoiner and I enjoy playing around with it, but if I was in a position of employment for one of these companies I couldn't in good conscience recommend Bitcoin as a solution to any of these problems. Between the majority of hashpower being in China, and the issues with development and scaling, it would seem like a bad idea to seriously recommend it for enterprise level projects.
And that's not even considering the political baggage of being associated with Bitcoin's anarchist community.
For an individual to use at their own risk though it's pretty fun and interesting.

The Citicoin thing was mainly in jest from the way I read it, and the information that was released was that they were just playing around with the technology. They just got some testnet style blockchains running to get some experience and understanding of the tech and named it Citicoin internally. That is probably the most interest we've seen publicly so far in terms of a bank showing a minor interest in actual blockchain technology though.


And that's more or less exactly what they appear to want based on the available information. No need for tokens.
Also, if they really wanted to they could always create a fairly decentralized permissioned blockchain by including many different organizations. Each block would require m of n signing to be accepted, and internally each actor could have their organizations key itself only sign with m of n, to eliminate the issue of a single person being able to cause problems. It wouldn't be like Bitcoin, but 50, 100 whatever financial organizations could come to a type of decentralized consensus that way. 
I don't think we're going to see that anytime soon, but it's possible that they would implement such a system in the future if they wanted some distributed/pseudo-decentralized global consensus.

Careful with this type of stuff. Organic demand is best. We keep seeing companies drop Bitcoin after being mislead that there was huge demand waiting if only they would add Bitcoin to their payment options. 
It will get there eventually. If I want to support someone on Pateron and would like to use BTC I'll let them know when that happens personally. But not until then I don't think. 
Also, one issue is that I believe Pateron payments are monthly recurring payments or charge per content payments or something that I would assume rely on automatic charges. That's both a disadvantage to Bitcoin in some cases, and a huge advantage in other cases by protecting you from unwanted subscriptions. But in Pateron's case if they accept BTC it will probably have to be something like loading your account or advanced payments(which is fine, but different).

Didn't take very much to move the price back then though. And I've read that early 2013 was when Andreesen and the rest of A16Z started to accumulate, and the timeline makes sense. One interested billionaire and his friends easily could have been singlehandedly responsible for getting things going in 2013. 
To replicate a similar scenario it's going to take far, far more capital in demand to raise the price.

Other stuff you mention is debatable, but there's a few people around who can argue that they're part owners of the idea behind Bitcoin and he's one of them. Bitgold is very similar to Bitcoin and Satoshi was undoubtedly influenced by Szabo.
@_date: 2015-10-19 07:29:25
I agree. The real use cases for everyday people aren't self evident yet, so there's very little reason for the average person to use it. 
Especially so in my experience being in countries that offer banking apps that people have on their phone where they can easily send each other money instantly as long as the receiver has a domestic bank account. I don't really have a solid answer to the 'but why buy or use Bitcoin?' question other than drawing some parallels with gold. Which some people do understand, but that brings a separate line of question related to why they should choose to diversify into Bitcoin over buying more gold. 
I personally use Bitcoin all the time and it's been the main way I've moved money around for a while now. But people also know my situation is a bit unique since I earn money in BTC to begin with. If people earning BTC was more common I think that would help a lot because it eliminates the question of why should they convert their other money in to Bitcoin in the first place.

They didn't necessarily have to stop buying. Supply just outstripped demand at that point. There's lots of people with thousands of BTC who can dump at any time. Or even just slowly sell off lowering the price(assuming they can outstrip demand).

It really, really is. It's actually hard to believe that it's a real project with real funding behind it.

There were lots more nodes back then and Bitcoin was far more decentalized than it is now. Running a node wasn't even a big deal since you used BitcoinQT anyway in most cases. For a very long time I didn't even realize that doing that counted as running a 'full node', I thought that doing that required some fiddling with the command line or something and took more resources, but apparently that indicator that showing that you're connected to 8 peers or whatever was sufficient. So just keeping your BitcoinQT around and open since you'd use to send some BTC here and there anyway was pretty common. The blockchain was much smaller too. It wasn't a big deal and that's why there were far more nodes.
@_date: 2016-07-09 07:53:28

The difference is in the intent. There's nothing wrong in theory with *premining* 100% of the supply when you've made that clear from the beginning. But when you launch what's supposed to be a PoW currency mined over an emission period of many years, and then you 'forget' to set the difficulty correctly and 'accidently' start mining massive amounts of blocks, with an early launch or something similar that doesn't get fixed(because you don't want to give up your millions of coins), that is the very definition of a god damn scam. Present something one way, lie and do it a different way which benefits you. And then when you go on and try to downplay it and mitigate what happened to further the scam it just makes it worse. 
How would Bitcoin look if Satoshi mined 50,000 blocks on the first day when he'd made it clear that a 10 minute block target and 2 week difficulty change was his intention? I'm pretty sure if he did that by accident he'd relaunch it and be transparent about what happened.
Dash/Darkcoin is a scam because it was launched as a scam(as X11Coin generic featureless coin with the X11 algo to attract minimal attention) from day one. It's been a while, so these might not be exact numbers but I remember it being something crazy like 2 million coins mined on the first day on a coin with a total supply similar to Bitcoin's 21 mil. Just insane that it's alive today. A small group of people, and mainly their lead dev have likely become very wealthy though because the market just doesn't seem to care.

People like to call Bitcoin deflationary, but there's nothing about it that's inherently deflationary. The money supply inflates, albeit at a predictable and gradually lowering rate. And of course there's nothing that guarantees that it's price inflationary since that relies strictly on demand. 
The money supply inflates quite a bit for a long period of time. Even after the halving it should be at around 5% money supply inflation for a long while. I know it was around 10% and then dipping under 10% coming up till now not too long ago.
We can't know for sure, but I suspect the inflation rate was primary set this way as an adoption incentive. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 21:50:31
No, I'd say Bitcoin as a database talk as if that's what's good for Bitcoin and its own blockchain is more retarded personally. Bitcoin is better used for financial transactions between parties rather than some expensive datastore that's either cheap enough that the blockchain gets badly bloated, or expensive enough that it's not fesible to be used as some organizations database.
People out there want their own distributed data storage and Bitcoin is not the answer to that, nor should it be imo. If they want to actually send bitcoin then of course they'll use the Bitcoin blockchain. Otherwise I'm sure there's probably a handful of good non-Bitcoin solutions that are being developed and deployed now for them.
edit: Surprised people are downvoting this while we're all sitting here dealing with and complaining about spam transactions, stress tests, and a blockchain that's already 50GB.

I don't think it would take 2 years if the US government was serious about it. If it was a matter of national security I'm sure they'd just nationalize 21 Inc's ASIC design or some similar US entity if one exists.
If it was China they could probably do it in 2 weeks if they had the will given the amount of hash power already there. Then even if 2 weeks is too optimistic, there's all that production capacity already in place there.
But I think changing the PoW is more likely than blacklisting a chain. But I'm not a core dev or anything so if someone wants to correct me feel free.
But even after changing the PoW if the government is still committed it just becomes a war of attrition.
And realistically, what kind of market cap is Bitcoin going to sustain under attack from a powerful government? Don't forget the cost to attack is going to be directly proportional to the value of BTC. In reality it's a war that many governments could win if they really wanted to.
In the end Bitcoin might still exist technically, but it would go back to being a toy for enthusiasts like it was back in 2009 and 2010.
That's the harsh reality of the power of modern governments that so many people in the Bitcoin community absolutely refuse to realize. And that's why you should never gloat about things like Chinese evading capital controls, or talk about how if Trump is elected how Mexicans will laugh it up after their wires are blocked by sending BTC. It's just bad business to do so.

Wouldn't someone have to either figure out a way to implement multisig in Cryptonote tech, or write a ring signature implementation for a BTC clone from scratch?
If those things are true then I guess one advantage is that it exists now and works, and implementing it as a sidechain is going to be far from trivial in the short term. Long term? Who knows what kind of tech we'll see on sidechains. Patiently waiting to see what people come up with.

It wouldn't necessarily have to be a world-leading ASIC, just competitive enough. And with the amount of money they could throw at the problem, and the amount of people that exist now that have been doing this for a while now I highly doubt it would take any where near 2 years to design if time was an issue. 
Also considering the fact that they have no profit motive, they would be able to buy ASICs from outside sources since they can out compete anyone on price. They would probably want to do this covertly though like you say. But then again, since the Bitcoin response would likely be to change the PoW, maybe the smart play would be to purposely 'get caught' by shocking the market and driving up prices quickly making it obvious. Then they could actually save time and money since they can skip the SHA-256 arms race and move on to the new one. And given roughly equal starting ground the US government is going easily win the war of attrition. 
Easiest way right now though to attack the current PoW would be to use national security as a political excuse to co-opt 21 Inc's ASIC design which is pretty good.
If they needed to use a domestic chip fab they could do that too. Although I wouldn't be surprised if they used China or Taiwan like so many others do.

That doesn't follow. Someone saying that the high fees aren't a problem for the network is just an observation. The network itself functioned fine. And saying fees are necessary for Bitcoin is just a statement of fact in a system that will eventually eliminate the inflationary reward and rely completely on fees to incentivize miners to secure the network.
Saying that implies Core as a project is unwilling to scale Bitcoin makes little sense. They're the ones with the scaling roadmap and the technical ability to actually get things done in a safe and efficient manner.

It should make everyone second guess crypto imo. Or at the very least nervously watch the results.
One of the fundamental security assumptions of crypto was supposed to be that breaking the immutability of the ledger was against miners economic interests. With the exception being if and only if not hard forking would result in certain death due to a base level protocol failure or something(and that was certainly not the case with the DAO).
But here we are watching the market challenge that assumption. It will be a while before we see how things ultimately play out since markets can stay irrational for a long time. Still, it's a pretty big deal for everyone that we get to witness such an event and I'm really curious to see how it plays out. If Ethereum transitions to a federated model or something then that would be interesting and consistent with how they seem to view their project.

I really hope no customers end up losing any money due to this. But really after all the blog posts I find it very hard to feel much sympathy for Coinbase as a company. It's like they just couldn't sit still in 2016 and seem to be actively going out of their way to stir things up and branch out as some sort of protest against Bitcoin not compromising on its decentralization to satisfy their delusions.
Although it appears that Brian Armstrong is the one who really went off the rails. Possibly the other co-CEO guy Fred too, but from the little I've seen he appears to be a bit more reasonable(not sure what to think since it's Brian who's been doing a lot of tweeting and blogging). So I might be unfairly blaming the whole company rather than just blaming what appears to be very poor judgement by its leadership.

Well, first thing I'll say is that I'm not claiming there shouldn't be any negative repercussions from the whole thing. I don't think very many people are pleased with the meeting at all. 
You can argue that the 6 Core contributors lied, or didn't hold up their end of the bargain, if you want to. I don't really have a stance either way. But the fact of the matter is that they are just 6 contributors and there are a hell of a lot more than 6 people that contribute to Bitcoin Core. Not to mention the community support. They certainly couldn't have promised that their personal agreement would guarantee consensus from everyone else. At least that much is clear. If you want to believe that they failed to uphold their own personal agreement, and not Core as a project, then that's fine. I don't really know what the status is or what their personal intentions are right now.
I don't think anyone there had any intentions of misrepresenting anything though. From what I understand they were put into a pretty tight spot under a lot of pressure that shouldn't have existed in the first place. But since everyone now sees that this type of thing was completely unproductive anyway, it can just be chalked up as a lesson going forward in how not to handle these types of situations.
@_date: 2016-07-23 17:36:08
The fact that even though 6 prominent Core contributors attended the meeting and made that agreement and it was still rejected in the end doesn't imply any sort of centralization of development to me at all. I wouldn't disagree that the mining aspect of that meeting demonstrates some centralization though. Not happy about small groups controlling so much hashpower.
They can't promise anything because they know that everything requires strong consensus in Bitcoin.
Segwit did and is proceeding towards release. It seemed to be done a while ago now anyway. I remember some people seemed to be a little gun shy about signing off a code review since it's a major addition, but people did eventually I think.
People did speak out against the meeting. Even right away some other Core devs questioned and criticized the meeting. Seems lot of people were not happy at all and at this point it seems that it's unlikely another meeting of that type is going to happen again.
I don't think it was a 'stalling tactic' at all. More like miners who somehow got convinced that there was an emergency and thought that doing something like this would help(I guess?). It's easy to see now that the whole crisis and 'crash landing' was a fabrication by people like Mike who started XT and then those who continued the fear campaign with Classic.
But the sky didn't fall, and things are proceeding quite smoothly. So hopefully the miners have learned not to listen to minority groups that are simply trying to manipulate them and scare them into assisting them in their power grab.

It probably is factored in for the most part. I don't claim to be a market psychic or anything, but it's probably not just a coincidence that BTC has rallied so much ahead of the halving. And that includes of course the knowledge that production will be decreasing.
I'm not a fan at all of any kind of strong efficient market theory in most cases, but with an asset like BTC that has perfect information related to production, it's probably at least somewhat efficient.

Regardless of the terminology, Roger Ver seems to honestly believe that is censorship free. While unpopular opinions and a ridiculous downvote threshold of -50 censor anyone going against the grain there.
Not to mention all the other sketchy banning and such that keeps coming up. I wouldn't have a problem with them censoring/moderating their sub however they want, but it's just wild how Roger is essentially completely clueless and disconnected from reality again. 
He needs to take a few days off and go to an onsen or something, then come back and start from square one in trying to figure out what's real, what matters, and what doesn't in Bitcoin. Because he just continues to go off the rails even further. His approach to Bitcoin is damaging and I don't think that too many people would disagree with me. Even if he means well and thinks he's doing what's in his own financial interests.

No, it wasn't a scam at all. They had the idea of consumer electronics with ASIC mining built in. This was in 2013 before China took over Bitcoin and mining became ultra competitive with difficulty increasing far, far faster than anyone predicted.
So they misjudged how viable their original plan would be. Since then they seem to be trying various things. But they did mine a good amount of Bitcoin. And if they still hold it and have it on their books, they should be in pretty good shape financially. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 07:28:01


What? Any evidence?
Do you mean like in theory if Core raised the block limit to 20 MB we'd experience a colossal boom in growth? Or do you mean you have evidence that current growth is literally being stunted now? 
And even if theoretically there was some small growth resistance for a month or two due to capacity issues(and I have no reason to think this, just a hypothetical), segwit is on deck now to relieve a lot of that.

It's kind of scary to think what the combination of an ETF on a major stock exchange and manipulation through a single centralized exchange could result in. I can't imagine that it would be allowed to happen on a regulated exchange, but I guess I wouldn't be too surprised. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:00:56
Because Bitcoin miners will always be more efficient than consumer devices. It's a competition versus professional mining conglomerates who develop their own chips and build their mines so that they can get the cheapest power possible. There's not much chance of any consumer mining device with consumer electricity rates being profitable at this point. Meaning it's more rational to acquire BTC another way if there's utility to be gained from it. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 17:07:03
Preload these things with 100k satoshis and perhaps that can be used for whatever microtransations 21 is imagining without having to waste power mining at a loss. Not to mention having to pay for an onboard ASIC that isn't going to ever produce any significant amount of BTC.

Lol, when was this? A large portion of miners? Are you joking?


Then classic started a node race. almost got up to 70pct. Then core said nodes don't count to consensus only "economic" nodes.
70%? Again, are you joking? Plus, how many of those nodes were on the same cloud host controlled by a single person? Like 1500 at least?

Who is Cobra-Bitcoin and why are some people taking him seriously?
Well, he's 'someone', but anonymous. 
I believe Theymos said that he was added as an owner of bitcoin.org at the request of Sirius, who is the original owner of bitcoin.org but is no loner involved for those who don't know. I have no idea who it could be, other than the first thought that pops into most people's minds I assume, that being that he's Satoshi. For the record I personally highly doubt it and don't really see it, but I'm sure some people will be suspicious. Maybe more so now that he wants to update the whitepaper.
Also I'll throw in that Sirius was one of the first(maybe Hal was first though?), if not the first to seriously contribute to Bitcoin development along with Satoshi. I know that he was responsible for porting BitcoinQT to Linux which is obviously huge and opened the gates for a large portion of the tech community to use Bitcoin. I'm just mentioning this in general and not meant as a specific reply to you or anything, since it was like 7 years ago and it's probably safe to assume a significant portion of the community has never heard of Sirius.

Honestly it should make anyone at the very least a little nervous. They quickly and unceremoniously discarded what was considered one of the fundamental economic assumptions for permissionless blockchains.

@_date: 2016-07-24 16:04:36
Regular Bitcoin and Bitcoin Classic both have individuals who may control over 100k BTC. People on both sides both have very strong feelings against the other chain. If just those two individuals decided to dump on each other there would be massive economic damage. And that's just two whales expressing their economic preference, let alone everyone else. It's like nuclear mutually assured destruction(although I'd like to think that Regular Bitcoin would survive in the long run, but it would still be an economic disaster).
I don't know whether or not big holders who support Classic are as vehemently opposed to Regular Bitcoin the same way their counterparts are. But I'm very confident to the point where if a Classic fork ever happened I'd bet a lot of money that there are lots of people who would instantly liquidate all of their BTC on a Classic chain as soon as humanly possible. Definitely at least six figures of actual BTC. Classic is a failure condition for many people, and cashing out would happen on a large scale even if by some miracle Classic had 90% of the hashpower mining its blocks.
In a contentious hard fork people are going to vote with their wallets because that's just the natural economic consensus at work. And even if there might eventually be a winner, the potential for devastation is huge when both sides have significant resources behind them.

The developers at that meeting are not 'Core'. Core is not some monolithic entity. Show me where they claimed to be representing the Bitcoin Core project please. Contributors sure. But they obviously don't speak on behalf of the whole project. They act as individuals.
Where are you getting 3 months late from? All I ever saw was that a pull request would be coming in April, and I think I remember that happening. Why do you think that it was promised to be rolled out in April?
It's very clear that there's been lots of work and lots of testing done for segwit though so I don't really see how anyone can complain about that at all. Even if it was 'late', it should go without saying that rushing such a major upgrade to please a few malcontents would be silly.

Probably. I asked a Coinbase representative on here whether or not people in Europe could send BTC to their legal, regulated gambling sites that exist there, and the answer was no.

In my experience many countries have instant inter-bank domestic transfers. Many in Asia as well as Canada and the UK. Across Europe people have mentioned that it's common to have instant inter-bank transfers within their own country, but it's the SEPA inter-Europe transfers that take a business day at most.
So when asking around someone's mentioned Denmark doesn't have it yet, but another person mentioned that they might have something similar so I'm not sure what the conclusion was there. But if anyone knows of countries that don't have their domestic banks on this kind of network please mention it as I'm still trying to get a more accurate view of exactly what the situation is across the world.

I'm not going to make any claims about the general difficulty of hard forks.

I don't think there's too much of a rift at this point. It won't take long for them to get the truth about these issues. One AMA like this will probably counter hundreds or thousands of hours of Classic supporters attempting to mislead the Chinese community. 
I don't think a HF is a risk going forward personally. I think we'll likely have a smooth hard fork at some point in the future. Given the proper preparation and lead in time I think we'd be perfectly capable of pulling off a hard fork if there was consensus.
Despite all the people saying otherwise until recently, I think it's safe to say that all the people crying about how a contentious hard fork is a perfectly safe way to upgrade the network are now quite publically putting their foot in their mouth since what's happened with ETC. And that's like more than half the battle right there given how loudly certain people were making strong claims about how they believed hard forks worked. It's just a constant string of a few people who've been both very loud and very wrong time after time.

On chain as individual transactions? No, and no one who spent more than five minutes researching it should have ever thought otherwise. Not meant as a jab at you at all OP for asking the question as your research, just that it's something even Satoshi himself said 6 or 7 years ago, yet the myth of Bitcoin being something suited for microtransactions has been something that other people have tried to keep alive for as long as I can remember for some reason. Despite Bitcoin itself never being something that ever appeared to hold potential in that niche due to the nature of fees being something required to limit DoS attack vectors. So beware of those with an agenda telling your otherwise, because there are a surprising amount of people who have convinced themselves that Bitcoin was made for the purpose of every size of transaction imaginable.
On another layer off chain with on chain settlement like Lightning? Probably. 
But personally I think for actual microtransactions there's no reason not to use a centralized provider. If we're talking pennies, fractions of pennies, and balances that rarely if ever exceed the single digit dollar range, the risk level seems like an appropriate trade off for what should be extremely low or free fees and instant transactions. Just deposit and withdraw whenever needed and keep a small balance for your microtransaction usage.

There was once a time when this sub was in such a tipping frenzy(BTC cracked $100 for the first time and a bunch of people became millionaires or close to it), that some guy started handing out thousands of dollars in BTC to people who did this exact same comment chain. Like people were getting $1k and $2k tips for their posts. It was insane. I think I remember him tipping $5k to the guy who wrote the original tip bot(NerdfighterSean?).
I wonder if there will ever be another point in the future where something similar happens. Maybe  if we see $10k?

I've been following Ethereum since the DAO attack and it's not surprising to me at all. It was a contentious hard fork from the start and it was decided by a bunch of insiders. They destroyed the perceived immutability of their blockchain, is it really that hard to believe that the original chain that hasn't been tampered with has value?
It was never dead. The economic consensus is what really matters in the end, and this is nothing new. The only reason the chain was 'dead' was that no one had a chance to open up the markets so that the chain could be properly valued and miners could do their profit calculations.
You can't seriously think that this has anything to do with Theymos and Greg, right? There's nine figures of trading volume on exchanges with fees(so no questionable Chinese wash trading and such). Why is it so hard to believe that contentious hard forks can and do result in more than one chain? When people feel strongly about something they're going to do whatever they can to keep the chain that they prefer alive.

Wow he's really doing it. I don't know whether to call him an evil genius or just a genius since he was pretty transparent about it. He supported the hard fork and got his $100k DAO refund, and if he exited eth and used at least some of the money to buy up ETHC, and then throws some weight behind it's not too out of the question that he'll bank seven figures of profit here since if ETHC gets some decent dev support and such it should be the better chain in the long run.

Worst name choice ever given the shitstain that Bitcoin Classic has left on the cryptoworld. 
Although the 'Classic' name is much more appropriate here, since I'm pretty sure everyone loved perceived immutability before those DAO idiots fucked it all up with their greediness, ie starting with a 500k target and then raising 150m. And now it seems that all the insiders want their money back and are apparently perfectly fine with throwing the integrity of the network out as long as they get theirs.

That's not what I mean. I mean if it's technically sound and won't compromise decentralization to an unacceptable degree, and fees are still high, then raise the size to whatever works.
I doubt any of those things are going to scale Bitcoin enough, except maybe Lightning, but from what I understand Lightning will require the larger blocks anyway, so if we need more than what we have then it shouldn't be a problem to get consensus.
To me it's obvious that there's more than enough people who will support a hard fork if it makes sense. So after segwit I don't see it being an issue. And if it is an issue despite it making sense as it probably will in a post-segwit Bitcoin, then it's a totally different ball game and getting overwhelming consensus to do it will be far easier since we're already on the logical path that we should have started on last year. Like we'd very likely have a hard fork target right now if progress wasn't impeded.
Committing before there's any data or knowledge of how things are going to go is just silly though. Instead of blind commitment, if I was writing an agreement I'd put some objective conditions and such that align with a scenario where it will make sense to hard fork. But blind agreement on a short term timescale is just asking for future problems.
@_date: 2016-07-24 16:07:45
Yes since Bitcoin doesn't have the same difficulty algo a minority chain would almost certainly switch out the PoW to something other than SHA256.

What makes a corporation a non-DAO?
It's not like government is required to run such an organization, if that's the issue.
The 'autonomous' part? If a corporation is run by its own rules and bylaws, what makes it non-autonomous? The fact that people are necessary to run it? Aren't all these so called DAOs ones that also require people?
I don't get it. And I don't get the fascination with the idea of a DAO at all. We have all kinds of organizational structures that are designed to be decentralized already. Humans have been decentralizing ownership in businesses for probably well over 2000 years, if not many more. I wouldn't be surprised at all if there was evidence that it goes way back before classical antiquity. 
If there's AI DAOs in the future that are run completely by AI and pay its profit to itself to sustain it and help it grow, that's kind of interesting. But I don't know what the incentive is (other than the 'cool' factor) for anyone to design and launch such an organization. I'd rather have the same thing, but centralized where it pays me the profit. Not sure what the point is otherwise.

People can and do use any client they want. But when differentiating clients adhere to different consensus parameters we end up with different blockchains. So we'll see what happens now.

I mean if 90% of exchanges aren't fully backing a UASF I don't really see the point of going forward. As much as I would love to see something happen like this that would be a huge win for decentralization. I thought the whole point of a UASF was the very simple fact that if exchanges and the market aren't buying BTC from miners that are mined on the old chain, they're simply forced to switch over else face financial ruin. I don't know, but I'm not really getting a strong impression that there's an overwhelming economic majority yet. I hope I'm wrong though.

Litecoin is pretty legit. Most of the hate always stemmed from the fact that it didn't really offer anything better than Bitcoin except the very debatable block time target.
Except now they have segwit and we don't. So I don't know what to say. It looks like Charlie sees an opening and is willing to drop a big CTO job to take a real shot at competing in the market.
I don't think I've owned any LTC since 2012 when it was worth pennies and traded on btce. So this isn't any sort of buy recommendation in case it reads like that(have to be careful these days since there's so much incentive right now to shill for alts).

The way I remember it was that when Classic first jumped on the scene they falsely claimed massive support and listed lots of different groups and businesses on their website. But in reality they had very few of those listed actually supporting them.

Minority chain in Bitcoin would likely have to replace the PoW algo and manually set the difficulty anyway so it's not too dissimilar. Depends on a few things though. If it's like 65/35 the minority chain could probably tough it out for 2016 blocks at the most without changing the PoW. But if it's like 95/5 then PoW is probably mandatory. 
If people want the minority chain it's going to happen in any scenario I think.

It's hard to say that definitively considering the economic model is one that progresses towards entirely fee based miner compensation.
I think the fact of the matter is that mining, economic incentives, and long term decentralization were just not something that Satoshi could have realistically planned out perfectly. He did a great job with the core of the system, but there are so many unknowns and variables.
I think he had some general ideas, but I can't imagine that he'd be able to devote much time to really thinking out long term scenarios when he was so busy getting Bitcoin off the ground first. It would be really nice to have some commentary and thoughts from him over the years, because there's so much more knowledge we have now that he didn't have back then.

This is getting pretty annoying now. 
Hard forks are not all created equal. Given a strong consensus, Bitcoin could hard fork. And if it did, it would be approached thoughtfully and done over an appropriate amount of time. 
It seems the new game everyone is playing now is to make vague general statements about how some kind of 'FUD' was proven wrong by the fact that Ethereum hard forked.
If people think the reason Bitcoin Classic failed was solely due to the fact that people refuse to hard fork Bitcoin then they're delusional. Their hard fork policy was just a drop in the bucket of reasons why Classic was a bad idea.
I don't even get the point that people are trying to make here either. What, that Bitcoiners are too conservative when it comes to hard forks? Someone give a decent hard fork proposal that offers some advantages and then we'll see exactly how people feel when given a proper option. There will likely come a point in the future where there's enough good stuff that can be packed in a hard fork to make it worth doing. Are there really a lot of people that are against the whole concept of hard forking in general period? Or is it just that most people realize that the benefits need to outweigh the risks before putting forth a hard fork?
@_date: 2016-07-21 12:30:45
Funding for everything it takes to run a viable blockchain. Developers probably take up the large majority of funds. 
Greg building the Ethereum codebase from git or whatever it is he did to check something is hardly 'working' on Ethereum Classic. Let alone 'frantically'. 
A fork happening doesn't preclude the possibility of two viable chains with opposing economic interests. There's a very wide range of possibilities, with many of those scenarios resulting in significant economic damages for both sides. It's not something that should be taken lightly at all imo. Doesn't mean that hard forks can or should never happen. I think they can and will happen. But doing something like Classic attempted with 75% and 28 day timer was a good example of something that could have ended really badly if their 'steamroll into a hard fork asap' plan actually worked.

But they already have significant control over the system. Anyone like the Winkelvoss twins or Ver who (probably) controls a six figure amount of BTC has big economic power.
So in a case like Ver, where he's turned out to be an unintentional bad actor for Bitcoin, what keeps him in check is that there are enough people who oppose him with more economic power than he has. It actually probably wouldn't be much different if there was hypothetically some robust PoS system that existed.
Imagine how much economic power Satoshi would wield if he woke up tomorrow and dusted off those private keys to 1.1 million BTC. I don't think it's really much different in practice than how it would work with a PoS system should one ever be proven to work at a serious level.
@_date: 2016-07-21 11:38:44
To say that contentious hard forks are simple and that they just work as a general statement is ridiculous. Especially in Bitcoin where both sides of any contentious hard fork have access to massive amounts of money, tens of millions at the very least. Put some decent funding behind the non-fork side in Ethereum and I'm sure they could have done a lot better than they did. It's just not compareable.
If contentious hard forks in Bitcoin 'just worked', it probably isn't worth much as a technology.

It's not a magic number. Actually debating things like future scenarios and appropriate block size given different conditions is what people should be talking about rather than this mass hysteria political game.
It's part of the reason why just upping it to 2MB is a bit silly. Doing things right and understanding the how, why, when of how block size should be approached in the future is still an important topic.
It's not impossible that people find evidence that lower than 1MB is actually better for some set of reasons(I doubt that we're ever going to see a lower block size, but acknowledging the possibility is important). Or that 1.4MB is the size where tradeoffs balance out the most. 
Maybe things change and much higher block sizes might work too. If mining ever re-decentralized and spread out from China it would take a lot of centralization pressure off the network. The GFW might come down someday too(probably not anytime soon though unfortunately). 
It's a tricky question, which is why approaching it in an over-reactive emotional manner is completely counterproductive(not directed at you, but people in general). But that's what's happened so far with XT and Classic. Important decisions that directly affect decentralization should be approached seriously and thoroughly. And if people can see that XT and Classic are prime examples of what not to do, and how not to handle issues such as these, then we can get one step closer to trying to figure some of these things out. But as it stands we've just wasted millions of dollars in man hours getting sidetracked for nothing.

Yes, it's good to see that their ideas behind 'Bitcoin being good for microtransactions' meant on their own platform and not on chain. Otherwise that would have been a big misjudgement. But it's great that they're doing a lot of interesting projects on the software level now too.

Someone exploited an overflow bug to generate a block with 184 billion BTC. No one made any money from it though and it was quickly noticed and patched.
The biggest difference here is that there was no bug in Ethereum the protocol like there was in Bitcoin. There was a poorly designed and poorly implemented contract that failed. Quite different. Especially when the very idea of the system is meant to be machine  executed contracts with no human intervention.

People should be furious at anyone who's been part of the effort to hold back segwit for over a year. Really just a shitty thing to do and shows how little some people care about Bitcoin and the community. Putting their personal political interests and feelings over real progress. Just unbelievable that anyone can tolerate such people in the community.
It still pisses me off that Barry Silbert chose to validate these bad actors with his 'agreement' that just rounds up some of the worst offenders and attempts to elevate their status as decision makers or controllers of Bitcoin, while the whole community is here having our scaling roadmap delayed for a year or more.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:33:25
It's similar to how scaling was often dismissed historically, and people who questioned Bitcoin's scalability were often labeled trolls or 'fudders'. There were definitely people often complaining about the clear and massive shift towards centralization in China, but people on here and elsewhere would make excuses like 'it's just *pools*, it's still decentralized with lots of miners from everywhere that can pull their hash whenever'. People are resistant to dealing with issues that they think might negatively effect their investment.

Although the potential middle ground here is that those companies knowingly sponsored an event that booked Craig Wright as a speaker. That is also extremely sketchy.

Lol you have to be joking. The technical and economic consensus that exists is not a minority.
Everyone who matters and virtually anyone who has their head screwed on correctly is behind Core and their scaling plan for the near future. Brian Armstrong in particular has lost any credibility he might have gained in the time leading up until this year.
@_date: 2016-07-25 11:58:26
Yes, this is a really good post. People should be at least trying to act as rational economic agents. They shouldn't be relying on their emotions and attachments as much as many seem to be doing.
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:14:51
I don't think many people are refusing a base block size increase at all. It's just that segwit should come first and all the people delaying it are just making it worse for everyone. 
So many people have already said that it's very likely that a base block size increase will be needed in the near future for things like Lightning. Yet if it's not Classic, BU, or Bitmaincoin certain powerful and wealthy people simply don't care, since it's about control and politics with them. So the rest of us users suffer the consequences.
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:32:58
It's not about the banks as much as it's about the companies that are part of this reputation/trust network where they share data. And apparently Bitcoin is a big red flag. It didn't necessarily have to be a bank here that flagged him, but of course the bank is going to be the most likely one to sniff out financial activity that they apparently deem as sketchy enough to not want business from customers that are linked. And if they don't want you, I guess these other companies value their opinion enough to refuse service. 
It reminds me of a web of trust type thing. It's sort of what I would expect from groups of private companies in this day in age. Kind of sucks though. Makes me think about the downsides of living in a world where everything is privately owned, and given your geographic location you could easily end up completely at the mercy of those you rely on to provide essential services as they are free to do as they wish. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:56:50
Or just use the ones they already have on their own land.
edit: oh the US specifically, I was thinking China there. Yeah they'd have to use some national security excuse and get the ASIC design from 21 Inc or something and then fabricate a lot of chips. Or just design their own. Either way they'd be perfectly capable of doing it. The PoW algo would be changed of course though. Then it becomes a war of attrition.

I agree. If anything this is a small taste of the type of damage that could be done if Bitcoin got a bad reputation for one reason or another. And that's not even starting on what politicians can do when they start with their bullshit rhetoric and fear mongering.
I don't think people should take such an aggressive attitude. It seems  many Bitcoiners vastly underestimate how bad a 'war on Bitcoin' could actually be. Economic failure is worse than technical failures that can eventually be fixed.
People should welcome integration with the banking system rather than fantasize about some fight that's probably unwinnable. Then maybe there's a chance in the future Bitcoin can work itself out from the inside like a virus.
@_date: 2016-07-19 14:18:42
The thing is it wasn't supposed to be about values at all. 
It was supposed to be that it's not in users/miners economic interest to ever challenge the immutability of their blockchain unless not doing so would be fatal(ie the obvious hard fork to fix the 184 billion BTC block). It was assumed to be irrational, as immutability was one of the fundamental properties that give a permissionless blockchain value.
But here we are. We get to see a real life experiment to test that theory.
You may be right that it's values rather than economic interest that truly protects the Bitcoin blockchain. But I'm not sure I'd be too happy to find out that's the case.

With a dozen USB keys I wonder what the expected value of paying expert wages to potentially recover a few grand is. Probably negative I'm guessing unless he was very confident that the data could be easily found and restored. 
Also considering the situation it doesn't sound like he has the spare cash to take a gamble on recovering the key.
Single point of failure backup obviously goes without saying a horrible idea. Not to rub salt in the wound, but if this makes even one person go and make sure their BTC is secure with multiple ways of restoring the data(some people like to add paper in that mix too), then it's worth it.

Is there anything special that makes it more resistant than say Scrypt was back then before the ASIC manufacturers were able to get to it?
Also, while it may be decentralize for a few years like Bitcoin was, even if it's fully ASIC resistant I think over the long run it should still tend to favor large mining companies and mega farms due to economies of scale. Not sure if it's possible to ever give an edge to individuals in that area.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:46:33
I didn't mention anything about a specific problem other than centralization. And no specific scapegoat, just geographic location of the large majority of mining within the borders of an authoritarian state that calls itself communist.
Bitcoin can change, but that doesn't erase the fact that its current state is one that would be considered a failure by past Bitcoiners who participated in a vastly more decentralized system. The biggest issues were once pools like Deepbit and BTCGuild. At least then there was no geographic concentration of mining and people could and did point their hashing away from those pools as they approached 50%. That situation wasn't even good with miners being pretty slow to leave pools because they liked the decreased variance of big pools, but compared to how bad things are now it was great.

Yes, I think it's pretty obvious that Bitcoin in its current state has failed in the goal of decentralization. 
Imagine the reactions you'd get years ago, back when there were 50k nodes and regular people were building their own rigs with 4 GPUs. You give a vision of a hypothetical future with Bitcoin in the state that its in now, and people would easily call it a failure(not the price though). 
Things hopefully will get better though. Somehow. It's not like it can't redecentalize. But something major is going to have to happen at some point.

The thing is he likely owns a very large amount of BTC, and it should be in his long term rational economic interest to add value to it. And coincedently, him doing so is also in everyone's else's best interest. But something seems to have gone badly wrong and in the end everyone loses, especially him. I don't think it's a stretch at all to say that his actions this year alone have likely literally cost him millions of USD in actual short term BTC value.
As a peer and someone presumably in at least a somewhat similar financial situation with relation to bitcoin, I'd honestly be surprised if Erik hasn't tried to talk some sense into him a few times this year.
Everyone's financial incentives here are supposed to be aligned so hopefully everyone can remember that and avoid doing some incredibly stupid and damaging things such as those huge posts in Those are a perfect example of something that clearly harms Bitcoin and are also a direct result of Ver and his associates' actions this year. Shit like that should never ever be happening.
