Why bluff?

You are right.  I was thinking of the post that he was responding to and thought he  took that position.

You are right bud, I took a big risk and it has paid me off so far...

He means it is worse to lose 10k when you are fifty than when you are twenty.

I am going to read it now... am sure it has valuable insights based on other posts.  I am very very emotional by nature and always get on a running forward horse and get off a running backward horse!  Tine and again, time and again. I literally forget to stop and think for a moment when I am looking at the screen.  
Even after all all all of those blunders, I think I must be really very very lucky to be sitting on profits, I should say!!!  I already took out my capital of 18k USD.  I was a newbie back in March.  Didnt know what I was doing.  My friend and I treated bitcoin like a toy and oh man did we have fun, oh yes!  I would anything that was dark green and sell off as soon as it turned red.  Can you believe I lost almost 2 btc in Noble coin?  What was that word again?  Patience?  What is it???
But it only took us one bad decision to be sitting on some coin hoping it'd recover which it never did and by that time btc skyrocketed and we sold that some coin for a very low price and in fact felt a bit relieved.  Since then I fought so hard with the market to recover half of the money I lost in that coin and like I said, I am lucky to be even typing this now!

I didnt think about it at all when I first came across this in 2013 when my coworker was looking at a screen when I remember seeing bitcoin was at $100. I didn't ask about it because I wasnt at all into this trading thing. 
After a year, I left that place and not until mid 2015 I casually came across bitcoin again when it was $1000.  I thought of my coworker and thats it.  I joined the same company again in Jun 2016 and this time that same coworker casually mentioned Ethereum and said he was doing very well between this job and his trading.  I was scared to ask him further lest he may reveal his wealth and I didnt want to hear that!    My bad.  I had some health issues later and checked bitcoin in Sep 2016 when it was $650.  
And again in Dec 2016 when it hit $1200 again, thats when I woke up!  I had some 6k to pay off a credit card but I wanted to invest in bitcoin and ethereum.  I wasnt sure.  The coworker was not very encouraging l, he said something like he would pay off the credit card.  And mentioned having a strategy and starting with $200!!!  Oh come on, I still went again and bougt ETH for $1000 @ $8 each.  And then I forgot about it.  Literally.  I wish I had forgotten for a year!  But nope! I looked at it on March 1st week and thats when my journey started.. lots and lots of unlearnt lessons on the way!!!  I invested 17k more from credit cards (some 0%) at different times.  And also took all my capital out along the way.  I never had savings, thats why I had take money out every now and then!  
I am not a millionaire yet, still looong ways from it!!!

But only if you knew how and where to invest.  Had I just left it in BTC or ETH back in April/May, I'd be sitting on 300k but I didnt and therefore I don't.   In hindsight everything is crystal clear!!!
