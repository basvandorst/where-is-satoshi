Would you recommend coinbase instead? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:42:23
Alright ill give it a shot. You rock thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:53:31
Do you have an opinion on coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:50:35
You are a legend thank you for this. What is concerning me  now is that the bitcoin.com wallet is saying "insufficient funds" when i attempt to transfer it to another wallet. I am going to download bread and see what happens. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:41:42
I guess what Im trying to understand is that do they own actual bitcoin but bought it from someone who supports bcash or is it actual bcash disguised as btc.

I really do appreciate your help. Im just new to this and dont know what thoss terms mean haha.

If you took the time to read it fully you'd realize its not a tax payer question. It involves actually a pretty big topic in the bitcoin world currently and just wanted to hear opinions on coinbase. So instead of wasting your time being pissy about it maybe just try to listen to other people who have the same interest as you man. So have a good day and cheer up buddy.

I definitely appreciate this thank you seriously! Is coinbase a good place? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:48:17
Haha it's all good. Do you have a preference of what i should use? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:50:05
Sounds good seriously do appreciate your feedback. Is there a way to tell if its true bitcoin? All i know is that he has a balance in his BTC wallet and his Bcash wallet says 0. Just from what I heard on hear some people are saying the wallet is shady and it all is still Bcash.

Do you have an ultimate preference? Appreciate the help! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:27:03
I appreciate your time to look! Why does arcbit have you deposit btc into the account before entering any personal details? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:14:46
Awesome I've been looking into that one. Appreciate the help! 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:37:55
Well i tried transferring it to a coinbase wallet and and it says insufficient funds every time I attempt. It says BTC and i think im okay but it is slightly concerning when its not letting me transfer wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:17:37
You feel that it is a fraud? Just want to clarify so i can relay the message better. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:44:52
Appreciate the help. I have been hesitant to invest cause i want to do more research and one of my friends recommened bitcoin.com. I guess I'm just confused on if it really is bitcoin that shows up in his BTC wallet. Could he use the current balance in his BTC wallet on bitcoin.com and transfer it to a wallet on coinbase.com? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:45:39
Sorry i meant they in relation to my relatives who bought from bitcoin.com
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:32:04
So i noticed on the app it has two wallets. One labeled BTC wallet and one labeled BCH wallet. There is a link to buy bitcoing but youre saying that i wouldnt really be buying bitcoin even though it would show in my BTC wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:32:18
All of the above haha
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:37:04
I think bitcoin just found its national anthem. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:11:16
Okay thank you I will look into that. Do you know have an opinion or know anyone who uses bread? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:03:57
Yeah i guess thats what i mean i need to experiment with it more. I appreciate it! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:46:59
Trust me the reason I need to verify is so i can withdrawal all activity. Do you have a recommendation of where to buy instead? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:36:26
It's funny when you aren't at .5 yet you're like damn keep going down and then when you hit .5 dips feel horrible lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:17:49
My friend and I were so fed up with him we made t shirts that said "I hate Tai Lopez." 
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:00:17
Explain to help me out then so I can clarify. Thanks mate.
