For an Upvote your post has to be sensible !
Using a word “crash” is itself NONSENSE.

Right or wrong decision - Time will tell.
But happy for you mate, hope you get in again

“Bitcoin will never touch $10k. Stop dreaming.” - someone said me this 1 year ago. Hahaha
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:05:15
What maintenance has to do with “dump” ?
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:21:21

@_date: 2017-11-26 10:16:53
That’s Perfect !
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:00:03
Seeing the speed, I really don’t expect any major dip even at 10k
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:53:50
Plan A Fails, Plan B/C is BitCoin
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:48:35
For past 1 year, I have always been buying ATH’s !
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:42:04
Strategy is “always HODL”
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:52:44
Good job
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:38:22
Do you think only “hype” can take it to this level ?
Suggest you to complete your schooling first and BUY BTC to Experience BTC !!!

25% gain from ATH to reach 10k is very much possible.
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:57:54
God bless you with more and more.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:58:41
That’s called “POWER”
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:28:12
“Each time” you sold you regret it. You have answered your own question.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:44:14
Looks like you have missed the train
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:54:12
Trading alts with BTC is risky too

Read the article in first comment 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:49:39
I can see only digit 10 with this speed

@_date: 2017-09-13 15:20:31
You are not at loss until you sell

Action speaks louder then words.
Experience is gained gradually after entering into it, not by just studying / researching.
Theory vs practicality 
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:46:44
It does entitle my opinion if someone is writing on public portal and asking for the usage. 
My only point is if someone has never got into something then how can he form such an opinion ?
Are you also "waiting and watching" like him for the right price to get in ? Haha :)
PS- just a joke, don't feel offended now :)
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:57:32
Best of luck

@_date: 2017-10-23 20:48:07
Yes. Doesn’t matter you purchase BTC before or after ledger nano arrives. Till that time you can keep BTC in your online wallet or exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-14 08:32:27

@_date: 2017-10-27 12:19:18
$7500 seems very much possible 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:59:47
Why being negative without any reason ?
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:56:31
NO ONE can predict. Take Your own Decision
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:49:30
Google it's content, watch some Youtube Videos. Try and understand blockchain technology. You need more knowledge about BITCOIN !
And stop creating FUD here

First, never assume things, do your thorough research before buying.
Second, keep yourself updated after your purchase.
