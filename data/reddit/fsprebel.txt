A troll is a a troll. Rand isn't for drug use either but he wouldn't put you in jail for it, same goes for the abortion issue. Only a feminazi would demand strict compliance being pro-abortion and certainly no one here for Bitcoin.

His filibuster over drone usage and due process a few years ago went for over 13 hrs, this isn't his first time to the rodeo. He actually lives and breathes liberty and that is why he's the Ace in the Senate but hopefully this community can help him become president which would be great for the rest of the world.

He's campaigning in a republican primary which consists of a major block of evangelical Christians and such, so he has to come off socially conservative somewhat but his main issue is the spending and the debt. He's said from day one that he ran for Senate to handle the debt load so I wouldn't get into the weeds and worry about so-called social issues. He's a libertarian like his dad and would refer abortion and gay marriage type issues to the states per the tenth amendment. The fact that he pulled this thing off almost single handedly tells you what the real deal he is especially when the hawks in his party are foaming at the mouth about him.

It's back online.

This is getting annoying, seems like a regular thing these days.
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:19:48
Yep, me too. FFS, this is a pain in the ass. Let me guess, another 24 hrs in the dark...

Lots of info being shared over there plus it's way more interactive than here. Also, many posters get paid bitcoin every month for a total number of posts they make, especially the long time members. Lastly, it's a way to pass the time for people who are bored, under house arrest or bedridden from an injury - like me.

Looking good, yall! Not if but when and the regulators are apparently looking to foster the innovation. I know but had to throw that in, good times ahead. Buy some bitcoins soon, folks.

If you buy into the ETF, afaik, you won't exactly have any bitcoins per say in any account for you, you just own shares of them but the coins stay with the ETF owners. Buying bitcoin yourself means you have to have a wallet or wallets to store them in with w/ hard to guess private keys. Ultimately, the more savvy would hold their coins in offline cold storage wallets and newer types would use online wallets like Blockchain.info, coinbase.com, circle.com to store the coins. You can easily buy coins by using coinbase or circle. If you use wallets from coinbase you won't exactly own them even if you have a tough private key cause the exchange holds them in IOU form although barring any govt interference, you should be safe. If I were you, I'd keep part of the stash on blockchain and the other on coinbase that way you're not all in one basket barring any horror stories. If you can figure out offline cold storage you're probably better off. However, I believe coinbase has insurance for your coins but that won't help if the govt starts bailing-in banks as likely your stash on coinbase would get a haircut like everyone else in their normal banks.

230 wall got mirked and held so now smokey bear wants payback. Some people must not like the movie, ""Gone With the Wind" :D

Would've thought they woulda gave some sort of notice especially on such an interesting day thus far.

Is bitcointalk down now?

You should see if the employer will match you a la a 401k match but even better.

That's where I'm at with my dad but he does fine w/o my pointers. If your dad makes great money then leave him alone. I'd just do my thing and let your wonders show him otherwise. You can't teach profit before it comes more than easily. They are stuck in the old world.

Yeah, seems like the non-committed have been flushed out and boy did it take a while to do that.
@_date: 2015-01-22 04:34:44
Go figure it happens on a day like today.

Blockchain is working fine my friend. or has been as of an hour ago.
