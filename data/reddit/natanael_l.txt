Eh, you technically don't need more than one hash/10 minutes to say you're mining. But going that low would be incredibly ridiculous.

I can assure you it wasn't spam or disinformation back in ~2013 when I and others discussed it here, trying to get people's attention and get them to help fix it. 
WHY is it too big? What's the problem? How could it make sense to intentionally lower capacity? Because you've decided that you know which transactions matter and believe you'll be one of the winners if you exclude those who can't pay as much as you in fees? Hubris... 
You really fail to understand game theory, incentives and the consequences of software architecture. If you get what you ask for, the consequences won't be what you wish for.
Your hostility is what's destructive, and I saw it all back then already.

Try archive.org's waybackmachine, and look for the original links right here in this sub where I posted and discussed it. 
Then you'll see how transparent your lies are. You'll see the creator of Greenaddress.it discus it with me, and planning to use my design in his service. You'll see my discussions of multisignature notaries. You'll even see my discussions on efficient scalability designs, and on how Zero-knowledge proofs could be used. 
You can even look up my contributions under the same username on the Bitcoin development mailing list, and on the Bitcointalk forum. 
That provable verifiable facts made you think my credibility hit zero just proves how utterly incapable you are of reason and logic. You do not deserve any more replies from me. You do not want to argue facts, you're only capable of fallacious emotional appeals.

Going below one Satoshi would require a hardfork, unless you're prepared to deal with pooling addresses and segwit style anyone-can-spend deposits / withdrawals with miner enforced rules. A hardfork would be much simpler at that point.

The protocol design might allow end user nodes to route transactions, but when will they ever actually do so? I doubt it ever would be configured that way by default, it just makes routing more complicated.

You'll probably need to link your wallet to "watching nodes" or whatever you want to call them. Nodes that would stay online on your behalf. Some might run them at home with home servers. Or on a VPS.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:35:50
All that matters is that you show the court it already existed when the patent was filed. The patent would then be invalidated.

* Coins can't be recovered from the payment channel locks due to whatever script error 
* Glitches make various payment hubs incompatible

* Payment censorship

* Exploits against the logic enables theft or other damages 
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:58:41
In PoW, neither, you don't care. All they can do is crash the market. Severe? Yes, but it CAN recover. PoS would suffer MUCH harder. 
In PoS, you have no effective way to instantly revoke signing key validity. Best you can do is to have short validity periods and frequently push signing keys from secure hardware (holding a master key) to the online exposed PoS mining hardware.
For paranoid setups, this can mean once every 24h is the most that can be done, so that's at least 24h of unlimited tampering if you've got a zeroday exploit. And this is where your minority of voters is a weakness, fewer targets means less work to achieve those 51%. You'll never get a majority participating.

You don't have Bitcoin payment channels to them. You communicate with them over a custom protocol, like of like your own VPN server. That server helps you keep the channel alive. The channel is between the LN server and you PLUS your own server

@_date: 2015-06-30 14:04:37

The reason it rarely happens is because the potential profit is too low for those with the knowledge required 
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:57:25
Using Zero-knowledge proofs you can compress the blockchain quite drastically as you only need to express the result (UTXO set), not the full scripts or history, with a compact proof. 
The problems are inefficiency in generating the proofs and in lack of security proof.

Only because it has one of the most simple models, in that it is fungible, has predictable inflation, strong scarcity, etc... It is essentially an edge case. And even then other uses like colored coins makes the demand side unpredictable, which means you can really only say it won't hit zero, but not much else.

Quoting myself;
FYI, I think FIDO's U2F and UAF will beat them both considering it has support by Microsoft, Google, Yubico, Qualcomm and more.
It is a standardized protocol for authentication that allows you to authenticate to multiple websites with one hardware token WITHOUT allowing colluding site operators to see that you've authenticated to more than one of them. And it will work over both NFC and already works like a standard Yubikey over USB, not to mention the killer feature that it blocks credentials phishing by tying the authentication to the encrypted SSL connection to the server such that it can't be reused or MITM:ed.
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:51:26
Correct. You'd need to make independent requests through different channels.

They certainly would attempt to encode patterns it has found in the form of optimized code blobs to offload the main AI logic systems. The same way we humans don't do all math in our heads even if we'd be capable to. I can only assume they'd make use of massive FPGA rigs for speedy processing.

Not just provable. Not just something you can do once a year. But you can prove it live, at will, on demand. You can design your finance software to prove it continuously, for every transaction, if you so wish. Remotely. To anybody in the world. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:32:17
Not just SPV - you make isolation attacks trivial as you can create one block over an old point in the blockchain and fake almost ANY transaction to a node on for example WiFi.

SPV level security is typically sufficient. Block headers + the chain of originating transactions + the transaction given to you is what you need. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:39:55
Yeah, like that age old phone without any updates which I can zeroday, delivered via ads, to root/jailbreak and use to perform AARP spoofing. Or why not target the router itself via XSS on somebody's phone against its web console? Or I can go for the printer which was last updated never. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:33:08
Some things are highly predictable. Obvious incentives to abuse lack of security will leak to abuse. Allowing the risk to remain is IMHO actually worse 
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:33:16
Unless somebody else hits you fast. Spikes exclusively causes harm, they don't reduce risk. Using Bitcoin without zero-conf is easy and safe and doesn't limit you.

@_date: 2015-06-20 18:45:45
That's *you*. But given that it can be automated, it could easily be used to simultaneously target almost every WiFi network in large public areas at once, like in train stations and airports. And that's assuming nobody can mess with ISP level routing - take a look at BGP shenanigans before you dismiss that, a Bitcoin pool has already been hit by a redirection attack.

It is, but it would be close to the experience of integrating Bitpay 
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:48:19
I think better terminology around decentralization is needed.
LN is a federated **coordination** server model, rather than centralized authority. Authority implies an ability to make decisions of significance that's not been previously accepted, LN servers don't have that. Centralization implies it behaves as silos the way Facebook does, when it rather behaves like email or XMPP. Email is federated, you use servers, they coordinate. Thus federated coordination servers. 
(OTOH Stroem is slightly different, their tokens for the merchants put them in a hybrid model, where end users see it as federated coordination servers, while merchants gets tokens to cash in to withdraw from one server, adding a component of trust where the server manages funds in a centralized trusting manner, although they can still get customers coming in via other servers. IIRC AFAIK YMMV) 
More accurate and succinct terminology might help the discussions too by making it more clear what is going on.
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:15:55
It did. The message size was limited, but it would parse arbitrarily large blocks as valid.

Given that the definition of theft is to take something away from the owner to keep for yourself - the act of creating the transaction and putting it into blockchain and/or the act of acquiring the private key and taking away all copies of it from the owner would be theft, as both those give you control over the coins while taking it from the owner.

Fractions of the total supply. Because if the value isn't in the unit (as compared to x kg gold can do y), but rather in that only this thing can do y, then a given supply will end up divided proportionally to demand among those who wants it the most, independent of the number of units. 10 units can be split into 2/3/5, 100 can be split into 20/30/50. Same effect. Same fractions.

@_date: 2015-06-12 14:38:52
Anything that adds transactions outside the blockchain that DO NOT result in one small set of transactions representing the full state change (coinjoin, payment channels, lightning network) is a hard fork, because when entering the small main chain you need to prove the validity of the full chain of transactions to those using the main chain only.
But old nodes who only use the main chain will reject all state changes not fully represented by valid signed transactions in the main chain itself. So you can only lock funds on the main and move them out, but never return to it without a hard fork.
Soft forks are changes that makes validation stricter so some actions either are banned or result in a narrower range of more strictly defined outcomes. Hard forks add behavior that conflict with existing validation rules.

It isn't just loans. It is layers of loans depending on other loans that depend on other loans. Literally.

That's industrial use. You proved my point. There's other materials which resist corrosion, so that's no advantage for its use in jewelry - but gold is used because it simultaneously is a good conductor and malleable enough to be applied in a very thin layer, which is why it has industrial value. 
People want to show they afford it. Again, literally anything expensive can replace gold in jewelry. Gold has tradition behind it, simple as that. People don't even care about fragility in jewelry when it comes to the high end.

Increasing block size: X*increase factor + Y
Increasing number of blocks: X\*increase factor + Y\*increase factor
Batching means you add more latency. You're not supposed to have multiple blocks in a chain being propagated simultaneously across the network, you just increase the forking risk by waiting with announcing the first block. 
Total latency in the network since a block is found is what you want to minimize. Not just computing overhead. Not per-request network latency. But total propagation latency since the block is discovered.

Every computer scientists and mathematician disagree. It is information. How else can it be encoded as numbers and note sheets? 
Why *should* it be paid for? That was never the model in the past, that started about a century ago. That's a new idea, to pretend information is scarce. What makes that a good idea? In the past it used to be paid for in advance, simple as that. 
The artists should definitely be rewarded and incentivized, but any system which relies on punishment to work (artificial restrictions) is doomed to fail.

Quoting myself;
FYI, I think FIDO's U2F and UAF will beat them both considering it has support by Microsoft, Google, Yubico, Qualcomm and more.
It is a standardized protocol for authentication that allows you to authenticate to multiple websites with one hardware token WITHOUT allowing colluding site operators to see that you've authenticated to more than one of them. And it will work over both NFC and already works like a standard Yubikey over USB, not to mention the killer feature that it blocks credentials phishing by tying the authentication to the encrypted SSL connection to the server such that it can't be reused or MITM:ed.. 
How it works: an app, the browser or whatever else detects a request from the server to authenticate. It may be a HTML tag in a web page or whatever else. It tells you to connect your hardware token.
You first enter your username on that site, then you plug the token into the USB port or hold it to the NFC scanner and press the button. From the perspective of the user, you're done. 
Here's what it does behind the scenes: when registering, which to the user works exactly the same, the server ask your hardware token to generate a fresh keypair. The token encrypts it with a secret key it holds locally in its hardware. The token uploads the keypair to the server encrypted, plus the public key unencrypted. In this process, the browser or app tells the device which SSL certificate the site uses, which used used as an input (don't remember the exact details). 
When authenticating: when you enter your username, the server will send your encrypted keypair for that particular site to your token via your app or browser and a challenge to sign a unique nonce. This request comes along with the details about the server SSL certificate and about the active SSL session. Your token decrypt the keypair, sign the challenge, and encrypts it to the server and sends it back over the same SSL connection. Now ONLY the same server is capable of decrypting it and conforming that you authenticated.

Most of our banks here in Sweden haven't even experienced enough trouble to show signs of troubles. We've been relatively well insulated from the biggest economic problems. The biggest problems the people experience here is a heavily cooled down job market.
We've even got quite rational financial agencies advocating for higher loan amortization rates and other such actions focused on reducing the current largest risk factors (the housing market has been quite heated here too, with many only paying interest rate on loans but not amortizing). They want to ensure we have good safety margins if the financial crisis grows worse, so we don't get the same issue many places in USA has had with foreclosures on homes in entire neighborhoods. They're still obsessed with inflation/deflation, but so far we haven't had any measurable deflation induced trouble despite some areas effectively experiencing deflation.

You have a data link only. You're only sending bits, getting bits back. You can't trust that there's uncompromised sensors on the other side. You don't know what hardware is there. You can't expect the person to have friends that is connected (Amish?). The endpoint is supposed to be a biological creature, not electronics. That creature needs an electronic interface to interact with the data link (again, this interface is untrusted). 
You would need a way to ensure the data sent back can not mimic another person. That it can't be modified enough to look like a new person different from the real user. An entirely simulated person must not be able to look real. You need to tell twins apart. You need to detect when somebody lies about having a twin. Twins shouldn't be able to impersonate their own twin. You need to tell if there's any living thing at all on the other end. You need to do all this with a computer alone on your end. You would need to ensure that the profiling data generated ONLY can detect if a person is who they say they are but NOT enough to mimic them. 
It just can't work. Can't have perfect 1:1 unspoofable authentication remotely based on the biology of humans alone.

An insignificant one. You essentially claimed that the value in jewelry is independent from that in finance, and that the physical properties of gold besides scarcity represents the majority of the value. That isn't remotely true. Scarcity and malleability made it useful in financial transactions. The value it gained from that COMBINED with its looks made it popular. If it wasn't recognizable as highly valuable in jewelry, it would get replaced with cheaper materials that look as good. The remaining demand would be insignificant. People even buy jewelry with gold BECAUSE it keeps the value over time, which is a result of long standing tradition. 
 
Scarce, hard to counterfeit, malleable, non-volatile, and compared to the remaining competition it was also more well known and less corrosive. Thus easy to trade with. Rare + fancy + valuable = instant status symbol. 
But once the uniqueness is lost, the basis for its value outside the now long established tradition simply goes away. Tradition can be broken too. Alloys can replace its industrial use. And so on... If the use in finance is replaced with for example cryptocurrency (which can be securely traded online without counterparty trust, unlike gold), if the position as status symbol is lost in jewelry, if alloys replace it in industry, what's left? Almost nothing.

If it is on the shelves for the old price it is still supply. 10 units at price X with 10 buyers and 100 units at the same price with 10 buyers is still increased supply. But the buyers maybe don't want more than 1 unit, or they have more important things to spend money on than a second unit. And the sellers aren't willing to drop the price. So the price doesn't move. 
Growing numbers of buyers with a low pain point IS growing demand. It just is another form of demand than same number of buyers which gets more willing to buy. The two effects aren't interchangeable, but you treat them that way.
Real life deals with discreet numbers here, not arbitary precision decimals. You can't have half a buyer, for example, even though the math can give you a model for one. You're extrapolating so far that your model doesn't match reality anymore.

But that's no loss if he sells later for that price. Selling for loss isn't profit. It is income lower than your expenses. Stop calling out profits. You can call it revenue. 
The idea was it is continously produced, put on shelves with one price, and at some point the seller ends up with excess stock. Reducing production then just lowers the growth rate of the size of the excess stock until stock reaches normal levels. 
But the demand remains. People want one. It just lies at a different price level. If the price goes down, demand doesn't just spontaneously automatically appear, there's plenty of things you can barely even give away. 
I'm not denying the simplest edge cases of it. I'm just saying it has zero predictive value. It is an approximate observation *only* in the real world. Because it can't tell you what actually will happen at different levels of supply and demand. Knowing about it doesn't help you. You can't calculate anything with it. The only thing it means to you practically as an individual is that the other party must be willing to accept your offer - which already was obvious.

So you don't understand that the technical applications are the only ones that aren't arbitary and interchangeable? 
The value in finance and jewelry are tied together. People don't wear gold exclusively for the looks. It is trivially replaceable. In this regard there's nothing it does that there's no substitute for. If people stop valuing it highly and stop using it in jewelry, replacing it with something else, then the demand drops massively right away. If you aren't using the chemical properties, there's no reason to use it except for tradition / cultural value. The demand outside industry has no connection to the unique properties it has beyond scarcity.

But a negative margin isn't profit. It is a loss. You lose capital and gain less than that in revenue. Maybe the seller expects future demand to go up, or to remain static, and thus reduces production and waits until his supply matches the demand so he can sell at a positive margin. So he prefers more money later, rather than less now. 
If they're chosing to buy up all existing stock as soon as it arrives then there's demand. Just because they don't buy until price returns to normal it doesn't mean there's no demand. If your reject all types of demand not at or above the current price level, you're using a meaningless theoretical construct that teach you nothing about the real world. 
So the law is then again useless from the perspective of individual humans - knowing about it can't do you any good.

There's already a certain amount of computational load per payment. Onion routing it would increase network load, routing calculation load, CPU load and more. 
Hubs must also trust each other to some degree unless they settle often on the blockchain. They must also all have as much capital locked up in scripts as there is capital flowing through them. So there will be limits to how many hubs there are, and this too must be accounted for in routing calculations.

The point is that this supply and demand *does not* always translate to the real world. Just look at anything trendy - increased supply kills demand entirely. There's no linear drop, no drop to match the margins - but a drop to zero. Limiting supply can do the same - people might switch to something else, killing the demand.
The market is made of many individuals - sometimes the non-linear complex behaviors cancel out, sometimes they amplify each other. When they amplify each other, the standard supply and demand model flies out the window.
There's no such thing as unconditional laws outside physics, because the system is too complex.

The key to pull off a doublespend is to make the seller see the payment without seeing the conflicting doublespend AND getting the doublespend into the blockchain. 
The only way to make it likely that the doublespend goes into the blockchain instead of the payment to you is to send it directly to the mining pools - *before* they see the original transaction to you. And they will pass it on to other nodes on the network, increasing the likelihood you will see it. And for every second that passes, it is less likely a doublespend will succeed. 
So in real life, it is almost impossible to do without the seller seeing the doublespend within a timeperiod of under 10 minutes. 
So how should you react to a doublespend? Treat it like counterfeit cash, call the cops.

I typically do look at multiple scenarios at once. The editing to make it fully coherent come afterwards. Type of bits and pieces until all the components are on print, then assemble them. 
No, not two pools. Again. See the scenario of a 20% pool and a few 5-15% pools, maybe 20 + 15 x 2 and 10 x 5. One of which comprised of the honest miners (bundled together even if they're made of several pools, maybe one of the 15% ones). 
20 is over 51% when comparing it to the total of 20 + 15 (themselves vs the second largest pool of indistinguishable miners). Compared pairwise (because they work independently)! In this scenario the biggest pool don't want to take in new members unless the other pools grow to challenge it. Only in the rare occasion where they end up mining on equal length chains and the smaller selfish mining pool together with the honest miners have a high probability of then overtaking the secret chain of the largest pool (15+15 vs 20) and the smaller pool published their chain, does they have a significant chance of success. In other words, not very often. 
Also, if both you and the honest miners are smaller than the biggest selfish mining pool, the above mentioned logic is why you want to publish your blocks instantly (so you can overtake the biggest pool together). Which happens to be the same as stopping selfish mining!
Maybe I've been unclear, but I see no fault so far.

ECDSA have public and private keys of equal length. For RSA it isn't as straightforward because there are multiple parts to the keys. 
Bitcoin addresses are hashes of public keys, using a hash with an output smaller than the keys. 
Verification of signatures is done in a manner where you can plug in a public key, the data and the signature and get out a simple response like "correct" or "invalid". The math however is a bit more complex.

A single word isn't good enough against a large scale attacker (botnet, GPU rig, etc). 3-4 digits is a tiny amount of entropy, it is just few that are trying. It is certainly crackable, it is just a matter of if it is considered worth the effort or not (cracking power more or less expensive than the payout).

Network difficulty follows price. 
Bitcoin will behave like an S curve - adoption will slow down drastically at some point, but WON'T fall. It will just level out. And then stay there. Just like gold did once upon a time. 
Also, network effects will keep Bitcoin in charge, simply because it also can change. Google's SPDY didn't replace HTTP, it just triggered the development of HTTP 2.0 which copies some of it's features.

You're reminding me that I need to finish my post on my idea about a rolling compressed checkpoint system with Zero-knowledge proofs to enable full-node security for SPV mode clients (that don't hold full block data). It goes along with a federated mechanism for compressing transactions into UTXO set deltas (for example payment processors would do this) which is what miners put in the blockchain. You would never need more than the headers, the latest checkpoint and the transactions since that involve your own addresses.
If the algorithms could be optimized enough and stay secure this would be even more effective than lightning network at reducing load, and have better security, while also automatically boosting security for SPV mode clients from just economic resistance against tampering to full node security (can tell if transactions are left out or faked). Throw in NoRiskWallet (adding collateral on top of the notary multisig model with nlocktime expiration for fund recovery that Greenaddress.it uses, which I contributed to), and you keep the instant verification too.

Most cards connected to credit go via the credit card companies. That's not as simple as just ACH. 
You seem to simply be unable to see how the relevant facts applies here. 
It is just not always possible to manage an account! For most people there are numerous companies who can initiate charges against your account whenever they wish for any sum they wish, and if they screw up and charge too much or charges too early, you'll get screwed and can't do anything at all to stop it! 
There are even banks who deliberately processes charges against your account before the process the money sent to it, so even if you got paid before the charge was made, your bank account balance can end up negative temporarily, and all of a sudden you get slapped with a charge that you wouldn't have gotten if the payments would have been processed in order!

How am I? Saying I want harmful behavior to be deterred don't mean I want harmless behavior to be affected. Do you consider it a barrier to have to ensure you won't cause harm when you want to perform a highly risky action, or do you think any level of risk taking and potential of collateral damage should be accepted and only punished after the fact if/when there's a failure? It isn't voluntary on my part to be exposed to the risk of the actions of others. 
Cooperation is unfortunately very limited. People who refuse to play by the rules of others can cause lots of damage and are very hard to deal with. It is simple game theory. Large scale cooperation is typically the only way to stop persistent malicious entities. Just look at the internationally coordinated efforts taken to take down botnets. It is hard enough already with a relatively small amount of governments cooperating, doing the same in a fully decentralized world would require the cooperation of entities counting in the thousands. 
I don't see how such a system wouldn't converge over time towards a government-like structure which primarily differs from what we have now by name. I wouldn't be surprised by seeing corporate city-states in such a system, like gated communities taken to its extreme, where you have a contract instead of a citizenship. And I doubt they'd feel very free to live in. Or at the other end, cooperating farmer communities, also very far from the life most people are used to and with a low population density, which alone can't handle too much population growth. It is too difficult for the entire population of a city to simultaneously leave on a short notice, so the incentive against abuse isn't strong. 
You can't just only have the people willing to cooperate play nicely. Going back to topology, there will always be a limited number of optimal paths. If not enough of them are under control by cooperative entities, you'll quickly find that the land owners in question will tend towards rent-seeking parasitical behavior where they extract as much money as they can just because they know you have limited options. 
The people in control of the resources you need and the people who want to cooperate in using the required as efficiently as possible for your purpose will far from always be the exact same group. 
You are underestimating the effects of gridlock on infrastructure. You wouldn't get straight roads anywhere outside gated communities. The result of the court judgement in the 1930's that land owners don't have the right to stop airplanes from flying over their land would likely not have any equivalent in such a system, as any landowner just can opt out and demand any amount of royalty for planes flying over their land, choosing their own law to sue according to. Installing fiber would be insanely more expensive because of all the planning overhead and negotiations everywhere. 
Non-cooperation is too profitable. Our physical world don't make it easy to circumvent those who control strategical resources. For the incentives of a free market to always be strongly aligned with the majority of the population, it would require all participants to have perfect information about the entire market, that there are no strong external incentives to defect, that punishment is effective, that there exists viable options, etc... Too often not all of the required conditions are fulfilled. 
There is already tons of experimentation with mesh networking. However, what is being done just isn't enough. What it takes practically is something the scale of the pCell radio tech multiplied by a thousand, combined with routing algorithms that need to be millions of times mote efficient than what exists, and coordination on a level that is hard enough to achieve when all participants are willing to work hard together (just calibrating this shit for system-wide performance would be a horrible job)... 
And I have no reason to believe it would be easier to get it done with fiber, simply because of the amount of land owners you have to negotiate with. Again, topology and optimal paths come into play - to be competitive, there will ALWAYS be a limited amount of physical areas of which a large part you need to be granted access to. It is the physical reality of our world. The competition is naturally limited due to the difficulty of getting the job done in any other way than relying on these few optimal paths. You don't want a fiber cable moving like the correct path of a labyrinth, but as a spiderweb with straight lines and a few well interconnected high-capacity backbone links going end-to-end, which everything else is connected to. 
This can be easily proven with math. Topology, game theory, infrastructure models, etc... The only way around it is to be incredibly persuasive. In which case *your* competitors now are at the same disadvantage you used to have. 
The technology required to provide what you are asking for without either giving up convenience, performance or cost-efficiency is decades away at the very least for practically everything infrastructure related. And transportation will even then always be a hard problem *even with* cheap autonomous personal flying cars. 
For me it isn't enough with individual working components. I want to see a system. Sure, one can point out how to build a space elevator, but does that mean it will ever be practical? You need to consider the whole system rather than the individual components alone. Kind of like cryptography, tons of cryptographic systems collapsed spectacularly because the individual components didn't interact as expected when combined.

Oh really? How long does any central systems offering the same thing last on average? The courts tear them down quite viciously to stop money laundering, etc. Bitcoin can't simply be taken down, that's why it can offer it *and stay online*, because of decentralization. 
Each of those are centralized entities, but we don't rely on any one of them. From a network perspective they are all just a bunch of separate entities and none of them is a single-point-of-failure. So what if two thirds go down? We survive anyway. Sure it would be disruptive, but it doesn't destroy Bitcoin. It just destroys the individual entities, none of which you are forced to rely on. Anybody are free to offer any service they like, and can freely compete with Coinbase.

With a unicode dictionary of 8000 words assumed and uniform distribution, that's almost 52 bits of entropy. With a slowdown from scrypt at a factor of let's say a million, that's effectively 62 bits of entropy strength (and Bitcoin miners has so far calculated a bit over 2^80 hashes). 64 bits (4x as much) has been bruteforced before in public projects. Expensive, though. 
At a dictionary of 50 characters it is 51 bits strong with scrypt, about 2000x less.
At 60k characters, as somebody said, it becomes 83.5 bits.

OTOH a smartwatch that looks for physiological signals could be useful as a wallet. For certain sets of signals it would require the full password, for some just a PIN, and in some circumstances just allow transactions below a certain value, or block it entirely (no more drinks in the bar once you start to get drunk :).
Then combine that with this;  - this is like NFC on steroids
Tap the terminal with a hand (works with gloves on), and a BLE connection between the watch and terminal is established. Then you approve it from the smartwatch if it wasn't already auto-approved.

Intermittently mining on my laptop in the summer of 2010 (I think, maybe spring 2011), got 0.2 BTC that way. Was thinking of buying a few thousand coins back then, but never did. Bought in far later, and I've got a nice little stash now.
@_date: 2014-01-17 09:12:25
I do have good arguments, it's just in your eyes that they aren't convincing. You clearly have very different priorities and don't seem to understand how beneficial Bitcoin is our why to those who use it. I can't and won't force you to reevaluate your conclusions, the only thing that can do that effectively is you yourself seeing your predictions fail and ours prove to be right. 
I mentioned escrow, didn't I? The funds can be kept in escrow until you are satisfied that you've got the product you wanted in the state that was promised. It would also work if the seller is using a payments processor that holds the coins for them. 
You don't see how transfers among banks being slow, and really slow internationally, and expensive internationally, and bank accounts often having tons of fees, and being hard to get in many places, with restrictions on what you can do work your money (what you can buy with them and who you can donate to) etc, is inefficiencies and barriers that people will benefit from the removal of? 
You really don't seem to have any clue how banking is like for large groups of people, including most poor people. 
What would be more costly and hard with Bitcoin? 
Step one: tell your Bitcoin client to send coins worth $1m to address X, with a transaction fee of maybe $0.1. There are no step 2. An hour later the recipient can be sure it is at his address permanently. 
You're arguing from a position where Bitcoin remains fringe, but won't even consider what happens if it gets widely adopted. 
Not to mention that people actually already HAVE done what you say, and bought Bitcoins locally, sent them to their families abroad and had them exchange it, and they DID save money as compared to the fees they would have paid for an international bank transfer. 
It is the process that is predictable. And Bitcoin don't fall that much in mere hours anyway.

You can create a chain that is longer than the chain the rest of the network can create, so then you can select exactly what transactions to include.

It is because a human must say "I have met this person physically, I have verified he is who he says he is, and I have made sure he haven't registered before under a different name", and you have to chose if you trust the person who makes that claim.
Anybody can generate fake DNA data or get a copy of another person's DNA. If you know how somebody else will take a DNA sample, you can plant fake DNA on yourself as well so they'll get the wrong one. And you still haven't solved the problem with twins.
At best you can prove you are the same person who previously was there (given that you share a public key on your first visit so you can use digital signatures later), or that another person has made some claim about you (again via digital signatures, the digital certificate mechanism). 
But a person that show up out of the blue can't be proven at a distance to *not* be the same person as somebody else, or to be himself. You simply have no other option than relying on a trust chain (see the certificate mechanism) where somebody you know makes a statement you rely on.
Again, biometric data can be faked. Also, geoposition can't be verified absolutely remotely. Even if you use radio triangulation with trusted antennas of your own, you can't know the person in question really is there rather than having left an antenna equipped device there as a proxy. And with advanced enough equipment, an attacker can even make it look like his antenna is at a given point from a distance.
And what would position prove in the first place?
Once again, when somebody tries to authenticate themselves to you for the first time, remotely, there exist no type of data they can send you to securely convince you that they are a unique person with only one profile.
The only thing that is possible is to use a trust chain with digital signatures, like PGP's web of trust, where a human you know have verified the identity of the person you are talking to.
This is a matter of physics.

There are a difference between almost impossible and proven impossible without solution.
While Bitcoin was "impossible", it is a probabilistic solution (not a certain solution, unlike how we can calculate X + Y with certainty), and multiple solutions were already known before Bitcoin, but Bitcoin was the first to be trustless and resistant to outright malice.
And then we have things like proving you paid - how would you do that? You should note that algorithms only know what the computer tells them. Let's say we manage to create "black-box" style encrypting code obscuration (there's some research in this area, it isn't possible yet) that let you show it the current status of the blockchain to show that you paid.
Then what? I'll just take a really old version of the blockchain and mine my own fork with a fake payment. Because it all happens on an isolated computer, the algorithm can not know that the blockchain I'm showing it isn't the real one that the network currently is considering canonical.
So what if we start involving a network? What if multiple computers have parts of the secret? Then the mining pools can collude to fool the algorithm. Also, it would break if too many of the miners left too quickly, because somebody must hold the shares.
Also, you STILL can't prevent the end users from sharing the files.

Git can't establish globally consistent secure consensus.

With Android style sandboxing (talking functionally, not back-end) with API:s for everything and Intents (which actually resembles dbus), simplified privacy controls (it should be easy to restrict software from accessing what it shouldn't have, defaulting to minimal privileges), KDE workspaces which are actual separated by virtualization, etc, you can get a very powerful and flexible OS for getting work done securely.
Being able to create throwaway workspaces from templates (which themselves contain isolated applications like browser instances, etc) and with simple methods of sharing documents among them, etc, would be amazing. Just imagine what it would do for the security of journalists, and people who want to stay anonymous. (one use for the templates part is automatic creation of one-off identities with keypairs and all, with perfect consistency (minimizing behavioral metadata leaks))

You don't actually have to store everything in the ledger. You can have Zero-knowledge proofs for validity of UTXO Merkle trees. Then you have a few kb per block independently of the transaction count. 
But for that particular method there would currently be performance problems for the transaction verifier instead, considering how slow the generation of Zero-knowledge proofs is so far.

The timestamps don't have to be honest, you know? The majority of them can be backdated. If you just brought your node online you can't know the difference. 
If your node won't accept a chain controlled by 5% of the total stake, you'd be seriously screwed of there ever were a major blackout. You'd have to wait for the majority to get back online before you can resume anything.

Both. Zero-knowledge proofs can prove a deterministic build to be valid, look up zk-SNARK and the variant the Zerocoin / Zerocash team is working with. All you need is the hashes of the source code &amp; binary (just confirm that the hashes are valid the same way as usual), the equivalent of ZKP instructions for compilation &amp; hashing and a 288 byte ZKP proof and seconds of CPU time to verify. The ZKP verifier confirms that the source code with that given hash was used to compile that binary with that given hash, using that given compilation method. No need to setup a development environment or anything like it, *this would be done by a single click*. A full Linux distribution could be verified by the hash value that way!

Intrisic value can't be valueless in any context. If there is intrisic value, it can't go away because of the environment. 
Nothing is valuable in every single context ever. Everything is only valuable in certain contexts.

Electrum's seed, stored split up in printed shares using something like Passguardian. Then you remove the seed from the computer so that it only exists on paper.

@_date: 2014-01-12 09:23:41
I can say no wallets generates the change address from the paper wallet key. 
Multibit sends the change to the imported address. Bitcoin-Qt sends it to a random new address. Electrum sends change coming from imported addresses back to the imported address, but sends change coming from the deterministic addresses to a new deterministic address. 
Blockchain.info and most other online wallets lets you choose between simply importing the addresses (after which it would be treated like one of the above cases) or sweeping (moving all coins from it to another address, then not keeping the key).

The block header uses a Merkle hash tree. You don't need to forward the entire block, you can verify individual transactions against the header to see if they are on there. The list of committed hashes can be treated the same way, but unlike with the transactions you have no need at all to keep expired hashes, even for verification, so it would be like if they never existed because they have no effect. 
Mining could keep going as before, although all transactions should be temporarily halted if it would happen. Just start implementing this commitment scheme and the new signature algorithm, and roll out the upgrade. Then perform the transition.

The best way to learn is to face the consequences of your actions. Insulating them from the harm caused perpetually will never be a good idea. 
$400 a year is how much compared to what fraudulent chargebacks cost you? 
Again, there's nothing obviously wrong with taking all the regular details from a buyer and then getting a fraudulent chargeback anyway where PayPal sides with the scammer. PayPal and the rest are notoriously biased towards the buyer. Many of these try to get their items insured, but far from are all easy to actually insure. Unique items can be hard to determine the value of and to verify the authencity of. And the insurance can add a significant overhead. And once again, a single lost case can wipe out months of profits, because your claims won't always go through. 


It doesn't, but I had the chance to demand multisignature escrow using a service like bitrated.com first. If I don't, I chose to accept the risk. If the merchant is well known, I might not need an escrow and would rely on their own warranty offers. 
I've seen plenty of stories about companies that have had to absorb the cost of fraudulent chargebacks despite having done everything right and having the proof to show it. You seem to think this doesn't happen. 


IIRC the guy in question traveled. Visa required paperwork he didn't have in order to unfreeze it. And this is where a lawsuit costing more than what's on the card was the last option to recover the funds. So he let it go. 
How do you request a new card if you bought a gift card? Don't you need to register it in advance? Otherwise it seems incredibly open to scams. And if you register it, they know who you are.

Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme makes it fairly easy to improve your security. Passguardian is one simple implementation of this. 
You split the key into multiple shares, and you need a certain number of them to recover the key. Store them in different locations, and then a thief would have to find enough of these locations to recover your coins. Also, one location burning down won't make your coins inaccessible. Just make sure you have a good security margin, in that you need to be sure you can always recover enough of these shares! If you choose 3 out of 5 as your split, then you must always be able to access 3 copies to recover the key and this the coins. If you then only can get 2 copies, your coins would be inaccessible!

There are several compatible variants. I haven't used anyone of them yet, though. 
Diceware protects you from bruteforce by providing enough entropy to not be crackable. Having a known wordlist don't enable bruteforce any more than having a known list of characters, as the word selection is random.

I2P and Bote and all that can be bundled and made automatic. It's just a matter of packaging. 
Bote mail is only reliant on DHT, not a single server is involved. Fully P2P, just like I2P itself. Entirely serverless! 
Bote mail is nearly perfect, it really only needs a better interface and better packaging. 
Bitmessage on the other hand needs a total makeover, and probably isn't salvageable at all. It needs a completely new networking model, and an entirely different way of managing the blockchain. That's like 95% of the core of Bitmessage that needs replacement.

They cause damage that has a ripple effect, which end up hurting everybody. The ecosystem WILL destabilize by loss of diversity, which is what humans causes when they hunt animals or otherwise drastically alter their environment to cause extinction of thousands of species. In other words, if we just let it happen it will cause everything from changed weather (as the plants change globally, as a result of animal population changing) to severe food shortage (as change in environment and weather makes it harder to grow food). It may sound extreme, but it is 100% true and would indeed happen over a century of mass extinction and deforestation. We ruin the planet for *everybody*. 
I think the best way to stop it is to change the incentives rather than by force (find something better for those guys to do), but there are always some who won't change, and with that few individuals of a species left globally a single person can do a lot of damage.

That's still no hierarchy. Just a matter of distribution. You can argue that it isn't an ideal distribution, and I wouldn't argue against you on that point, but the definitions of pyramid and ponzi requires additional elements beyond that one, which Bitcoin lacks.
And also, anything with reasonably predictable supply and a reasonably fair distribution of any newly generated coins or transaction fees do not need newcomers to sustain value. Bitcoin, like gold, would still work just fine if only two people in the world used it.

It is more transparent. Also, merchants can stick with fixed prices (no need for either cash discounts or extra fees for credit cards) and aren't forced to increase prices just to keep a non-negative margin if a lot of foreign cards are used for purchases (5-9% isn't rare), so they never have to take a loss on a sale just because of fees. It isn't more expensive with Bitcoin either way, even cash have handling costs if you deposit it frequently at a bank.

That's not how it looks here. And CC fees are still high. There's no need to specialize every given transaction with Bitcoin, just pick your standard settings or stick with the wallet default of you don't mind. You only switch when necessary.
And in fact, via BIP70 (the payment protocol for letting your software communicate with the payment system) your wallet can silently come to an agreement regarding options you've approved in advance, such as weather or not things should be shipped together or separately if not everything is in stock while the order is made, or on which escrow to use if the merchant isn't in the whitelist, etc... All you gave to do is click OK and enter your password / PIN. The rest is automated. Your wallet client logs your transactions and can list options like the phone number to the merchant or a link to request RMA or whatever you want. 
If you knew how absurdly these things are implemented behind the scenes at the majority of the banks, you'd realize this is LESS complex. Security is the default and cryptography ALWAYS manages the authorization. You'd be surprised by how lazily chip EMV transactions are verified. Sometimes there's literally no verification! 
The costs isn't directly tied to the number, it is tied to the degree of human work to ensure everything is correct. With today's lazy implicit trust based authorization systems, that forces a minimum level of work to keep up with screw-ups and malice. 
You can replicate that banking option too, invisible from the user. And yet they gained cheaper and faster international transactions, more security and much more options. 
You underestimate how much software can do.

That hasn't been proven yet, therefore it is unjust to seize that money. Everybody should have a chance to use their own private clean funds to defend themselves without it getting tangled up by the prosecutor and seized.

Cracking millions of keys per second still is far from cracking one a day. It's a difference between giving everybody enough time to move to protect their coins or not.
Things like Fawkes signatures means we don't even have to instantly add a quantum resistant signature algorithm to Bitcoin, we just rely on that the public keys already are protected by hashes and use a commitment scheme to only allow transactions that's been commited, and if the public key wasn't known prior to commiting the transaction, the quantum computer still has no chance of replacing the transaction once published due to the commitment. The Fawkes scheme proves you had the private key before the quantum computer had a chance to crack it.

Bitcoin can be used in the real world to make cars know who owns them, instantly giving access to the new owner the moment that the money is transferred. It can prove the age of documents and contracts, which often is incredibly useful in court. You can use anyone-can-pay transactions to create trustless kickstarter style fundraisers. There are tons of things like this that Bitcoin enables that couldn't be done before.

Even if the ratio is a billion to one in difficulty, that just adds the equivalent of 30 bits of strength (log2 of a billion = 30). 64 bits gets routinely cracked, so you want at least 40 bits. 
XKCD's password example uses 4 words at 44 bits in total.
And that's for small sums. Long term you want 100 bits or more, so you need about 70 bits or about 6-7 XKCD words. Or a little less with Diceware, because they use a larger dictionary than the XKCD example.

The biggest problem of it in the context of Bitcoin is that many types of inputs can't be verified. Things like the current temperature and other real-world data requires a trusted IRL entity that can sign the data. You can only process the inputs in a secret manner. And each instance is independent from the rest and don't know how many times you have ran it, so rate limiting and stuff like that is impossible. Any input that gives the desired output can be repeated infinitely.

There are tons of chip fabs that can build SHA256 ASICs. It's not really complex at all. Almost anybody who can design IC:s can design an SHA256 ASIC. It's a really simple circuit, you can use existing free high-performance blueprints of SHA256 circuits and embedd them in your design, and you just need to iterate a counter on the chip other than that. I'd say there's several thousands of companies that could build them today. You could even "just" take a simple free minimal CPU design like a minimal MIPS and slim it down a bit further and hook a bunch of SHA256 processors to it and you'll have a high speed ASIC.

Where did you list features that was Apple's invention? 
How is oil better? 
The market won't grow forever. And those profits just won't last.
It is not purely government granted. It is possible to compete. Google Fiber has shown that, and I don't think they are losing out on that service. There are also lots of places with good small ISPs. But the big ones, however, mostly just suck. Stuff like ecosystems with lock-in and infrastructure that are often too expensive to build to make it profitable to compete with existing providers makes for crappy market dynamics. 
And what did they invent? I wanted smartphones with big touchscreens like the current ones since about 2002-2003 when I saw one of the Sony Ericsson P800 series phones. My first thought was "you could make software with any type of interface you want!". I wanted one for years, and then the Galaxy Spica became my first smartphone. The iPhone didn't interest me because I wanted a pocket sized computer, not a fancy sandbox. But yes, I can see why people like it. But no, I don't see anything in it that is new other than the polish. Not one feature that didn't exist before. 
There were no new features ot technology, as I said before. Just packaging. 
So then copy something from the website? 
The iPhone didn't have new features, anything new it could do that no previous phone could, it wasn't a new class of devices, etc. It had improved usability. That's not the same as the car. The car enabled completely new things for people, they could do things they couldn't before. The iPhone didn't. It just made them easier.

A virus could tamper with the code to show ANYTHING to the user. 
A network level attacker can chose what to relay or not. It can make her think her payments didn't go through, it can hide payments to her and it can select what transactions in the real chain to include in the malicious fork, and show her (valid) transactions not in the real chain.
This enables targeted doublespends. Also, if you doublespend against her and she try to pay with those coins, you can make her think it went through (by including the transaction in the malicious fork) when it didn't (it was never valid on the real chain due to the initial doublespend). 
You still need tons of mining power. 1/144 (one day worth of blocks) of the power is about what P2Pool has. You need to match that.

But yeah, Bitcoin doesn't have key revocation. There's no way to flag an address as no longer being able to receive coins or anything like it. Bitcoin is "agnostic" to the current status of the private keys. All Bitcoin knows is what transactions is in the blockchain. 
Another option is to sign a few different public keys with the private keys of the others to show they all belong to the same person, then you can later claim to have lost some of the other private keys later on.

You don't need expertise in crypto unless you plan to reimplement parts of it.

A modified version of this:
Instead of 2-of-2, there's 3-of-3 where you sign the transaction and one notary sign, then 24h later the other notary signs it (or the same notary with a different key).
And because it's a P2SH address where transactions ONLY are valid if you all sign, you can't doublespend because the notary won't do that, because you can prove in seconds if the notary signed conflicting transactions.
As Bitcoin currently works, this transaction wouldn't end up in the blockchain right away, but could be shared with the recipient right away.

The only way to keep the same ratio of ownership in Bitcoin vs the total available amount is to earn it on equal terms with everybody else. If they can't earn more faster than the deflation rate, chances are their spending will reduce their ratio of ownership, reducing the gap between large and small holders. 
In the current inflationary economy, the structure of the market and the distribution of printed money causes the gaps to increase.

Each vote contains a hash of the private key + name of the vote topic. A Zero-knowledge proof is attached to prove it is valid. Each hash can only be used once = each key can only vote once. 
Actually I have a partially complete scheme for Zerocoin style voting based on this, and actually this could enable quite detailed votes using separate vote fractions (to prevent profiling, although there's still issues I haven't figured out yet with the fractions). Everything could be public. It would need something like submission via Tor, I2P or email mixnets, with random delays between nodes for reducing available metadata to keep anonymity. 
The incentives for mining Bitcoin are far simpler and more direct. Participating in a vote is far more complex.

That's a commitment scheme, and is used in the Fawkes signature scheme. 
Quoting myself:
Actually, we could implement the Fawkes signature scheme to recover from this, by posting a hash commitment using a secure hash function of the transaction before the transaction is posted, because the private key can't broken until the public key has been published. This method shows you had the private key even before the public key was known.

1) that would be most of them because the code for it is trivial 
2) not much different from having to have a card issuer which the merchants accepts, today. Most local regions will likely have their own common lists of accepted arbitrators, this isn't that hard. 
3) fees won't have to be paid unless arbitration is necessary in most cases. I don't see at all why you'd have to wait for the transaction to process. The arbitrators can double as multisignature notaries if necessary as well, ensuring it can't be doublespent. 
4) don't set how that's different from fighting your cc company 
5) same as 
And using it will be as easy as installing a wallet (pick a merchant wallet if you're a business, consumer wallet otherwise), entering the requested details of you wish (like verifying the list of arbitrators, entering merchant name when applicable, default shipping address, etc).
The merchant makes a payment request in his wallet (same as with any payment terminal, no change there), it generates a request the costumer's wallet can understand, the customer scans a Qr code or taps his phone to the NFC device, review the details (payment sum and everything else typically on a receipt, and choice of arbitrator), and accepts (or denies if something is wrong). How is that hard to use? 
That  of yours is incredibly deceptive.
First you need a credit rating. Then you need to sign papers and send them in. Them you get a card with a long list of terms and plenty of fees. And then see all the same issues listed above (AMEX and others isn't accepted here, for example, just Mastercard and Visa here in Sweden at most places). You always pay fees, typically 2.9%, while with Bitcoin you'd pay a fraction of a cent + arbitration fee which can be below 1% (most of the anti-theft mechanisms and fraud detection and card network overhead is gone because it isn't necessary). If money is taken weeks later by somebody who *held* your card at one point, you'll be fighting them for weeks. Somebody got an extra card for your account issued by social engineering?

1: One pool which was comprised of both mining hardware owned by the pool owners and private independent miners (ghash) temporarily had 51%. In the time frame they had that, they only had enough computational power in comparison to the rest of the network to replace up to a few hours worth of the most recent blocks at that point in time.
2: Doing that would require consent from those independent miners, or else they would have left the pool, so they would then fail. 
3: Arbitary changes is impossible. You can ONLY chose to exclude new transactions, claim all rewards for yourself, and replace the last few blocks in the chain to undo part of the transaction history (allowing a doublespend by replacing a transaction of their own). Invalid data always gets rejected. 
4: it is absurdly expensive, and the brilliant thing with Bitcoin is that it is more profitable to mine honestly.
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:46:23
Bitcoins are not files.
They are public database entries. They are just assertions of numbers belonging to the people in control of the private keys that correspond to various public keys being, and that only they have right to assign those numbers to other people's keys. (The private keys can be torrented, but that would just be stupid.)
Music and videos are stored in files.
A bitcoin is an entry in a distributed database that *everybody* have access to.
You can not magically revoke access to the contents of files. Likewise the previous bitcoin owners don't lose access to the database entries when signing over their bitcoins, they only lose the power to continue to reassign them.
You also can not magically make a file available to somebody only if they pay in a decentralized network using only distributed algorithms, without anybody else being able to recover the file even without paying.
You don't seen to understand the concepts yet of how this stuff works.
The only thing you CAN do is to set up a server that will give people access to download the files if they can show they paid (this is already being done with Bitcoin). But they will be able to share it to people who didn't pay.

And *what is it* that makes it unnecessary after bootstrapping? 
How do you even know coins truly are dispersed? It is trivial for one entity to pretend to be many. Actually, the person managing the checkpointing could be doing it to make sure the majority of the coins is his at the last checkpoint once people believe it is well dispersed, then he'd pull off a history reversal attack and publish his own chain where he owns the majority. 
There is no secure way to select chains this way because there is no data that reveals which is more likely to belong to the majority of honest users. 
Even with well distributed coins, do you always select the chain with the greatest stake at every given point? If so, you make the history attack more dangerous (create a new block with a history from there with greater stake). If not, you made it an scrypt clone where the attacker can create millions of chains until he finds one which the network would prioritize.

UTC is the international time standard. UTC+0 is London time, we in Sweden have UTC+1 (daylight savings adds +1h).
The computer keeps track of the current time, and what time the other computers it is connected to has. The network time is an average of the time of all individual computers.
Blocks won't be accepted if their time is too far into the future compared to your computer's own time, and it also won't be accepted if it has a timestamp far too back compared to the previous block. So the timestamps on the blockchain always moves forward *approximately* as fast as the real time clocks of the computers on the network.

It doesn't necessarily have to allow for the roots (that Merkle tree / bloom hybrid thing) to be merged, but if it don't allow merging then the size starts growing when you add together a bunch of them, limiting how many and who can do it. You don't want too many roots like these in the blockchain either, so a few organizations globally would be composing then rather than everybody.
Although if somebody would try to create a maximally efficient transaction verification algorithm, small local organizations can compose lists of valid transactions with Zero-knowledge proofs of validity against the last Bitcoin block hash, so the above mentioned organizations creating the roots only need to check if any of them have been doublespent or not yet, and don't have to run a full validity check on them all. They'd just generate the roots based on the transaction list. 
I'm not sure either if you can assure strong security in being able to compare roots like this and guarantee there's no conflict (doublespent UTXO).

@_date: 2014-08-08 18:35:37
The UTXO of transactions later in the block isn't known yet when the client sees it being claimed, so the block is assumed to be invalid.
Also, doing it otherwise forces you to jump back and forth mapping out the relationships between transactions before validity can be verified, while forcing a linear order allow you to perform validity tests continously and instantly reject a block when encountering an unknown UTXO.

Isn't the checkpoint moving continously? And creating a chain takes seconds. And either way, you're assuming the target ALWAYS have access to the full network including trusted nodes. This is why it is such a failure, the requirements for it to remain secure is too high. 
Link? 
You are forgetting that I'm not simply suggesting to attack the full network directly, all together. I'm targeting individual nodes to start with, fractioning the network by making them checkpoint MY forks (created with real but small stake). Manual intervention is required for every single one of the individual targets to get them off the fake chains. 
Just look at the recent attack against one of the Bitcoin pools where the traffic was redirected on the IP level. Most rouge ISP:s and NSA and other intelligence agencies and a few private hacker organizations can pull it off. Isolating thousands of individual miners isn't hard i if you have that access, and creating chains is trivial. PoS don't have a straightforward way of dealing with that attack. But PoW recovers trivially. 
TAPOS won't work well if the transactions refer to blocks too recent because forking is likely to be common, in particular with an active attacker present. So repeatedly forking short parts of the chain isn't implausible.

Many of the younger ones of us that are interested in the technology are willing to wait a while. Bitcoin is just 5 years old, and the development is moving forwards quickly. It might not be easy to use tomorrow, but it doesn't have to be. Once it's finally ready for the masses, then the masses can come and use it.
Hardware wallets (small dedicated devices for making Bitcoin transaction) are likely going to be the solution for most people, who likely won't find it harder to use than credit cards, while also being more secure and enabling far more flexible services. It might take 5 more years, it might take 10 years, but since the knowledge and lessons accumulates over time, it will be made *much* easier one day.

You send shares. You're aiming for 20 zeroes in a row? Every time you hit 10 in a row you show your work (as always the work is based on the block given you to mine), so they see approximately how much computing power you're spending, because you can't fake 10 zeroes in a row either. 
And because they can see you're calculating valid blocks with 10 zeroes at a certain interval, they can calculate approximately how much computing power you have to be spending. So when the pool wins a block, you get paid in proportion to how much computing power you've spent relative to the other miners in the pool. 
When somebody finds the full 20 zeroes block, they send it in. And because you can't know which guessed value will result in the full valid block in advance and because you want your pool payments, the block created will be based on the given work where the payout goes to the pool. 
The work given always includes a payout to the pool when pool mining, and a share sent in that DON'T pay the pool is considered invalid and the pool won't pay you for it.

Difficulty is not per block. Difficulty is adjusted on a recurring basis after a number of blocks based on how fast the previous blocks were mined. As an example, you have X blocks of difficulty 1, X blocks difficulty 2, and between adjustments you have less than X blocks of difficulty 3.
To change the difficulty level you need to create enough blocks to cause an adjustment upwards. Usually several hundreds of thousands of blocks.

Oh, I'm sorry, did your memory fail again? The whole point is that they are INTEROPERABLE, you DO NOT need to support a billion services at once. This isn't fiat, BIP70 and its few extensions for supporting multisignature green addresses allows you to support hundreds of these services with one software package and almost no configuration.
Almost all of this can TRIVIALLY be supported in wallets and merchant POS systems, allowing you to see on a map (if you wish) who supports what.

Only if demands goes up faster than supply. If demand falls, price falls. 
I wouldn't call it a kill switch, maybe a disruption switch. It would certainly cause a price fall if those sold off, but they can only sell their coins once. Then the coins will be far more widely distributed. And actually, they would find it far more profitable to not disrupt the market, but to instead do a slow selloff. 
Dialup links and meshnets and satellites will keep the network functional. Nobody can create an EMP strong enough to kill all the electronics - large parts of it is under ground and in buildings with tons of steel reinforced concrete, not to mention that EMPs can't really harm most electronics when they are turned off (there is tons of redundancy in the form of inactive hardware!). 
Longest fork wins anyway in the case of netsplits. 
The pools would also lose, because it would be a costly attack that would make their own coins lose value. Only an ideological attacker could see it as a win. Not to mention that P2Pool is a decentralized pool that can't be hijacked that way.

Seems to be psychology in play more than practical arguments. People latch onto it because it *seems* simple, with minimal learning required, but they simply skip over the entire consequence analysis. They don't seem to grasp that most people don't have a tenth of the background knowledge they have, which is why the ambiguity will be a problem. The argument that context makes it clear IS THE REASON WHY it is bad, because ONLY a context the reader ALREADY understands will make it clear, and as I already said *they don't yet understand it well enough*. It would only work as intended if the unit was introduced to them *last*, not first.

Multisignature transactions is great for this. The version with multiple oracles is essentially a federated model, like the way email is federated. You pick which ones you want involved, and they're interoperable. Or you run your own. Nobody's uniquely privileged. 
The various decentralized market places being developed would be fitting for selecting and "contracting" oracles. Everything would rely on trust anchors (what entities you trust think of these people), something similar to web of trust, to make the reputation system work (spam/flooding resistance, and weighting trust calculations).

This isn't cash in the mail. The money can't just get lost, you can prove payment. If the reputable business don't follow through, they'll lose reputation and future customers.


So your argument is that if you chose the only options that works globally today, you can use them globally today. Just a couple of problems with that, what if they block services you want to use, or have too high fees, or deny your chargebacks or fraud claims? This happens frequently, you can't deny that this is a problem.


Microsoft, Dell, Time Magazine, Overstock, Virgin Galactic, etc... It isn't like you can't find big companies accepting it. Also, why does it matter that they process few transactions? Bitcoin is interoperable with anything supporting the protocol, it doesn't matter if they're a garage startup or not. If it works, it works. Your wallet client don't need to know about them previously, It Just Works.


Unfortunately you live in a naive little bubble.


So what's your suggestion exactly? Sign up for a new CC before traveling to be able to pay?




Wroooooooong. All of it. Your CC works BECAUSE there's "customer protection" contracts and chargeback mechanisms and all that tied together in software to the CC you use. That you have a CC means you signed up for all that. It is in your terms of service. Maybe you haven't read it, though? Are you sure you're protected against all the things you think you are?
And you know what? Installing a Bitcoin wallet is no harder, the signup process is even easier. All those same things can, as I have said several times before, be TRIVIALLY set up when you first open your wallet. Scan a Qr code or tap an NFC terminal, enter PIN, done. Nobody can steal your money, if the merchant gets hacked (as with Target and something like 5+ companies the same size the last year in USA alone) you do NOT need a new card issued.
If all that wasn't integrated with your CC, it would be as shitty as you claim Bitcoin is. So then why are you complaining about the possibility of doing the same with Bitcoin?


The differences in the bigger banks are miniscule. The only ones notably cheaper lack numerous options which the bigger banks have (such as direct payment integration for online purchases, and various standard banking services).




Are you just ignorant or intentionally lying? They're all released, it is just a matter of how widely supported they are. 






It is a fully functional proof of concept, for crying out loud. How slow are you if you can't imagine that being integrated in the form of a single click for signup in the process of first opening your wallet client? It could detect your location and origin country and let you select a few organizations you recognize and trust. Done. Then when you pay, your wallet would talk to the merchant system and agree on a mutually trusted arbitrator. The user don't have to do a thing! And anything with fees below 2.9% is still a win!
You seem to be intentionally denying the possibility of progress.

That pool's total payout would still be less than it would have been otherwise, and you get your ratio of that. So it's economically suboptimal.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:54:24
To allow for simple SPV verification of the header and still make the header hard to create (you need to have the blockchain), I think you might need generate a hash of the rest of the header, then hash that with blockchain data, then run the two rounds of SHA256 on *that* hash. So you need to fetch more blockchain data continously, and the blockchain data hash is appended to the header. SPV nodes just check the full hash to see if it matches the PoW requirement, full nodes check the hash of the first part of the header, looks for the corresponding blockchain data, and runs the same hash on the first part of the header with the blockchain data in question to see if that matches the last appended hash.
And if you limit how much you can change in the header (making it more static so the miner don't hash against the same piece of blockchain data with different modified versions of the header too much), then the miner MUST frequently hash against the blockchain data.
Although it still isn't certain the miner and the node with the blockchain has to be close together when doing it like this. But the pool operator would necessarily need more computing power if he does it himself (just validating wouldn't take too long, however).

Technically you CAN share addresses between different clients, but if if you don't use the same software and version on both then they can get out of sync and cause some very strange issues.
One of the most confusing things that can happen is that both clients will generate new keys and addresses that the other one don't have, so you'll have one part of your coins shared across both, and the rest of your coins will only be accessible from one of the two.
Blockchain.info and GreenAddress.it both uses a web server to synchronize data (so you have the same set of addresses everywhere), and will only hold the keys in plaintext on your own device, but you should be aware that using *any* web client puts you at risk from both browser based exploits and hacks against the servers since the javascript in the browsers can be modified. But using their local clients is as secure as any other local Bitcoin client since the code can't be modified remotely.

They use multisig between the buyer and seller. The final payment isn't published for inclusion in the blockchain until afterwards. So let's say you fill a tank of gas, you continously create intermediate transactions paying for what you've filled your tank with plus some margin, and when you stop then the final transaction is the one published to the blockchain. Throw in a multisig service like Greenaddress.it and you can't even doublespend against the seller, while nobody can steal anything. If they stop providing more gas you stop paying for more. If you stop paying, they stop providing more gas. You get what you pay for, that's all.
With a trusted multisig service like Greenaddress.it where several of the sellers accept the same one you can even have them bundle up several such transactions over time (like all transactions during the last week to merchants XYZ) and then merging them to further reduce overhead, using Bitcoin as a means of settlement.

It's a P2SH address, so only a particular script can be used to generate valid transactions that pays out from it.
So in this case, that would be a specific type of multisig transaction with chosen public keys that are required to sign (yours and the notary's).
And yes, the timeout period is arbitary. It can be extended (in advance when generating the address, or by just paying from it to one with a longer period) if you want.
Your wallet client could be set to maintain one such address constantly at a time with at least a chosen period of time left before expiration of the multisig requirement. That way you're not at any major risk of the notary of choice shutting down, or of not being able to spend quickly.

You just send the static size block header and static size IBLT data blob, and the receiving node will know which of the pending transactions he have is part of the block, and if he have all the transactions from the block or not.

You can reject malicious chains by subtracting from the calculated total proof-of-work if the longer chain has transactions that burn far less "bitcoin-days" than the shorter one.

Paper wallets like Armory's encrypted m-of-n wallets where you need several pieces plus a password, when the key is generated on an offline computer running a LiveCD with Linux, is probably THE most secure method if you store the pieces in different secure places. 
Regular paper wallets created on an offline computer is also reasonably secure. If you have a spare USB drive or writable CD, then use Unetbootin (for USB) or an ISO file burner (CD) to make a Ubuntu LiveCD / LiveUSB. Then boot your computer from it.
Then you can go to bitaddress.org and generate an address, write down the private key by hand, or print the BIP38 encrypted copy and write the password down by hand. Make several copies! Then reboot the computer again, and everything is cleared from memory. 
Never print unencrypted wallets on shared printers or on network connected printers, don't place them in places where others can get to them easily, make sure you have several copies in case one gets destroyed, and learn how the private keys work (every copy of a private key has equal power over moving it's coins around!). 
All online methods are less secure than offline methods. Unencrypted copies are clearly less secure than encrypted copies. 
If you have a permanently offline computer, you can use Electrum or Armory with their dual offline / online mode where the offline computer has the private keys, and the online one only has the addresses. Let the offline computer create a deterministic wallet, copy the Master Public Key to the online computer, then use the online computer to track your balance and create transactions, then use the offline one to sign them.

Because math and economics. Proof-of-work can't be faked, that's why cryptographic hash functions is used to create them (SHA256) and why it works in the first place. You can use simple statistics to verify who has spent the most work on their chain, check that all data is valid, that all digital signatures in the transactions are valid, and so on. It is unprofitable to create false chains. If you know the approximate current hash rate and chain length, you won't get fooled by fake chains.

BLE can't establish secure connections "unanchored", which is an absolute necessity for payments. There's nothing that can assure you're connecting to the right terminal unless you know the public key of the terminal and selects or verifies it manually.

Greece, Cyprus? There are people who see the need for it. 
The common method of using multisignature transactions is with pay to hash addresses (P2SH) where you create a transaction script that only can be spent from if it is signed by the chosen set of keypairs. 
Bitrated.com is one implementation to enable escrow/arbitration, Greenaddress.it is one to enable a wallet that can add services like instant verification (doublespend protection guarantee to merchants) and the same type of account limits bank accounts can have (if chosen by the user) such as spending limits. Most of it can be automated. 
Entire classes of fraud is eliminated and overhead is reduced, and now you can select exactly which services to use rather than being forced to use a bundle somebody else made for you.

Improve the architecture, use Zero-knowledge proofs so that you only need the headers plus the latest ZKP to know that it is a full valid chain, and then you'd only need the UTXO set to know your balance and spend your coins. And the headers would contain a Merkle tree hash of the current UTXO set in each block so you can directly see which known UTXO's have been spent even without needing to see the actual transactions, you just need them for incoming transactions to you.

You don't seem to know what you're talking about. 
First of all, it doesn't show how fast it assumed the quantum computer will run each round. Running one round today takes many minutes - so that 2*10^-5 is entirely impossible without massive speedups. You have to reset it, program it with the entire problem and read out the results, and restart it again, and each time check if the answer is correct.
Shor's algorithm effectively divides the keystrength by 3 (takes the cube root of the number of operations to break it). An ECDSA key that can be cracked in 2^128 operations by a regular computer would take 2^43 rounds of rounds on the quantum computer.
That's 6 981 463 658 331 operations that has to be performed. Multiply that by a couple of seconds per round, and then we're optimistic about how fast we could make them.

Deciding who'll mine next isn't scalable when you get large loads. You will get sudden peaks of huge load (inflow of transaction data). And when a large amount of nodes (Sybil attack) simply refuse to mine when it is their turn, then what? How long do you wait before request timeout? What if the top nodes in the list all are accessible only to different sets of nodes in the network (fragmentation)? 
What if you get 1,2,1,2 and 2,1,1,2 or 2,1,1,1? Do you sort when the sum is equal? And once again, what about network fragmentation?

How do you reliably tell the world that your delegation has been revoked? 
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:56:40
But you can't reject blocks outright. They can always be propagated through other sources than just the Bitcoin P2P network. Unless you can block the majority of the network from connecting to other nodes, which would be hard even to ISPs (hint: Tor and I2P), you can't stop propagation. Just slow it down. 
It isn't the non-mining nodes that vote, it is the mining power behind each chain that dictates which is chosen, and only that.
If a block follows the rules, *nobody* can vote against it in any other way than *mining on a competing chain*. 
A protocol violating rule modification will ALWAYS be rejected by all nodes that don't implement the changed rule. Even with BOTH 51% mining power and node count using the protocol violating rules, the regular nodes will carry on with the original chain and only accept blocks following the protocol, rejecting the ones with changed rules. 
To get the whole network to switch, you must convince the vast majority to update their nodes with the new rules.

Signing and encryption is different. You aren't supposed to be able to tell anything at all about encrypted data as such. 
The signature is something created using the private key IN ADDITION to the input data, which is verified to have been generated with the keypair that the public key belongs to. 
And in this case with ECDSA the public key can be derived from the message plus signature, and since the address is derived from the public key you just regenerate the address from the data plus the signature and run a comparison.

It would even make it harder to coordinate defense against an attacker. Attacker that buy or otherwise control their own hardware don't need pools. 
And it really would make it harder for small miners. Payouts would be too rare.

You'd need a ton of individuals to prove control over their own coins simultaneously, which represents the majority, with a reason to believe they are all honest, not under anybody's force and that they truly are in sole control of the coins.

Everything you add up that you use together should be judged collectively as one method of protection. Since it is all "algorithmic", you can measure the entropy = unpredictability of the whole thing together. 
And really, to an attacker it is just "strings a, b and c with obfuscation method x", and your entropy is the combined entropy of a + b + c + x (the entropy of the algorithm x can be described by how rare it is, because rare methods will be tested less). 
It is easier to make string a good enough on its own.

What if the 51%-er refuses to include those transactions of mine? So you can only stop a 51% if you detect it in advance before the full 51% is reached? 
What if the attacker specifically want to disrupt the network, with the aim to cause the need for manual hardfork concensus so often that it gets abandoned? Bitcoin recovers automatically the second the 51% PoW attack ends (you can hardfork earlier there too of deemed necessary by the majority), PoS doesn't. 
In particular, network fragmentation is one of the major risks with PoS as anybody capable of creating a valid block can create 2 or more and send them to different parts of the network. There's no non-disruptive way of effectively and quickly settle on one fork. There's no single metric that says "this fork is better" that can be trusted when under attack.

Option 1: you work on chain, everything your customers do means you move those coins between addresses on the blockchain. This is like treating Bitcoins as physical gold - it only counts if it is in your own vault. 
Option 2: you just use a logbook and write down what your customers want. You calculate who has how much. They trust that you'll get the numbers right and not lose anything. When they ask for withdrawal, you say "fine" and THEN make an on chain transaction out of your wallet.
Version A) you do this honestly and never lie about funds. 
Version B) when customer 2 send you $500 you take it yourself but pretend that it is still in your service wallet. When both customers want their money back at once (bank run) you can't pay them both. Game over.
Version C) what regular banks do. You take 1000, lend 500, and still keep 1000 credited to your customers. The loan taker deposit 500. You now have 1500 credited and a standing loan of 500 when only 1000 exists. Fractional reserve banking.
Both b and c can cause people to reject your promises of payment and demand hard cash (gold, Bitcoins, and such) if you get into trouble. This is what happened to Germany back in the day.

1: Your wallet can even do it automatically. It would be able to make sure you have a certain amount of your choice that is "notarized" at any given point in time.
2: If you spend for larger sums than you've got notarized, then of course you still have to wait for confirmations if the merchant requires them. But usually you won't spend more than a certain sum without planning it in advance, most big purchases isn't 100% spontaneous. 
3: If everybody subscribes to "notary alerts", it would be trivial to prove a notary malicious in under a minute after the doublespend transaction being signed. Just propagate both versions to everybody who have set their clients to trust that notary. That means the required level of trust is fairly low, if the notary has been around for a year or so then the risk of your transaction failing because of the notary is very low, so you can afford to trust a couple of dozen notaries.
Also, for example companies in the same mall or similar setup can agree to use the same notary, and maybe with something like iBeacon (bluetooth based micropositioning) or regular GPS or whatever you feel like, your wallet app can automatically move coins to a notary that the stores accept (yay automation!). Chances are your coins get a confirmation at the notary before you reach the checkout at any store, so that you then can spend it there without having to wait for further confirmations.

No, you were right about it before. You get as many bits as Diceware provides (capped at 2^160 due to RIPEMD160), but when you use the address and it's key to spend, the public key is revealed and can be used to perform a bruteforce in 2^128 operations.
If you use less than 160 bits, the address you generate can not be *any* arbitary 160 bit value, because it doesn't have 2^160 possibilities. 
About 100 bits is decent.

You can't reject all the options you're given because you want to continue with your current lifestyle. That's not a reasonable position. 
Even if we aren't the cause of a majority of the global climate change, you can't deny that the smog created by the current industries line in many places in China and other countries is directly harmful. Reducing our impact on nature isn't wrong. 
You seem to ignore the ways available to measure the impact of different options. Weather simulations work, even if inaccurate over long timeframes. More specific areas have much more direct methods for calculating what happens. 
When you can calculate the result of both options in advance and the outcome very clearly follow the predictions made for the choice you picked, that's strong evidence for that the choice DID have a real impact.

Not really possible. But you can reduce the risks. You can take a look at the ideas of zero-knowledge proof based attestations of coin ownership transfer off the chain, where you can see what part of the chain a doublespend happened at if somebody were to doublespend. The risk increases over time and with the number of intermediate holders before being included in the chain (if somebody doublespends, one of the the receivers loses his coins when the other one cash them out to the chain).

People have learned to lock their doors, and insurance companies reject claims if you were careless. But you should be free to be careless and never learn anything regarding money...? What a "developed" world. 
Link to one that will fight fraudulent transactions where the payment processor denied you? Terms and stuff, please. 
Are the fraudulent transactions you're getting months old when you get chargebacks? Otherwise I don't see how you can rack up large expenses because of them. If they're for recent transactions you should be able to cancel their accounts instantly. Unless you get flooded by them from new accounts, how much trouble do they cause? How many do you fight? How many of those chargeback claims do you win? 
Most consumers don't have stuff like that easily available, and I assume your insurance isn't necessarily cheap. 
Seems like your answer to everything is insurance, without any serious attempts at blocking the fraud directly.
How do you fight Visa if they deny your claim despite your evidence? And PayPal is like a stonewall. Do you think everybody can afford to go to court? Again, insurance, right? Do you think the people in those industries which PayPal are hesitant to offer their services to can get any insurance company to absorb the costs of the fraud instead? On who said it is negative - I did, because in many areas it is because of the fraud. I've already mentioned one field, and many other niches get it too, including collectibles. How cheaply do you think you can get lots of unique expensive items insured where there are lots of people doing fraudulent chargebacks after receiving them? The overhead is significantly higher than for a VPN if you try to isolate yourself entirely from all fraud. A single lost case could wipe out months of profits. 
 - there's tons of cases like this where the banks and payment processors refuse to reconsider their decision and just let you take the cost. It exists on both sides. 


How much does that help you? Against spammers with stolen CCs, most likely have the addresses. With the real card holders doing it, then what? You insist that you delivered and that they made the order? They can still claim or wasn't them or that it wasn't received. PayPal has denied claims where there were proof of delivery. 
If you lose your private key then you didn't do proper backups. Using Electrum and storing shares of the seed in different places is actually easy (see Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme). And you can make the tracks impossible to follow (coinjoin, etc). Gift cards are clearly worse because they are outside your control.

It is the real Linux kernel (the merge happened over a year ago, Google no longer maintains a fork). It's probably in your TV and router too. NASA is using it on both servers and laptops, even in the ISS. It's used by stock markets. It's in your home automation gear. And your car. Probably in your next gaming rig too. 
Linux don't care about your opinion, it's silently taking over world of electronics anyway. It's just so much easier for the developers than any of the other options, they can get their job done faster by using it. 
Same thing will happen with Bitcoin. Developers are simply going to take a look at the options and say "why not just use Bitcoin?" after comparing the costs and the time and resources required to get things done. 
Edit: since the troll's posts got deleted before I could reply;
Linux is Linux, if the source code of Linux is in use then Linux is in use. Android uses the real Linux, so does tens of thousands of different kinds of devices all over the world. 
It doesn't matter if the desktop environment isn't in use, Linux wasn't even originally created in a time where desktop environments on computers was commonly used. 
You're a nutjob if you think it somehow matters that the routers don't run a full copy of Ubuntu and that it therefore don't count.

How can it possibly be fully deterministic when the inputs (the chains and node lists) aren't? That just reduces to a crappy version of scrypt as you try a ton of different versions of the chain to find one where you're the next miner as well.
Also, transparent forging is an insane idea. That won't work when the load reaches thousands of transactions due to the instant peak in load on those nodes. They'll start to crash. You'll end up with network level bottlenecks too.

If the money available to pay salaries with only can cover X/month in total and the interest rates grow in total numbers but more than X, then what? You can only pay for it by having everybody spend faster so people can pay off their interest rate, and then the banks instantly have to hire people for the same money to keep it moving to pay off it all.

You don't add randomness if the source you take it from is predictable. If the total initial entropy is 32 bits then that's it. If I only have 10 well known repertoires of phrases and I'll stick with to the same one for as long as you keep asking me for words, you can't just ask for more phrases and expect to get something unique. Somebody else can just try the 10 repertoires with the number of phrases you asked for.
You can only add entropy that way by collecting it from external random sources in between the times you use it and mixing it in.

You can't even always get your bank to stop companies from being able to just simply charge your account on their own, even if you tell your bank that only you should be able to initiate charges/payments. 
What if I was managing everything perfectly well, and then somebody sends me the money I expected late, and a company charges me early, and suddenly the 5 day margin I had planned goes out the window and I get an overdraft because *other people* screwed up?

No, so innocent people don't get screwed over by overzealous greedy prosecutors. You're ignoring that innocent people get accused all the time. 
If you got your way, nobody who ever got prosecuted over anything wouldn't have any rights left, and just getting accused would entangle everything in your life, throwing you out bare handed on the streets, until after you won the case decades later - all over an unproven accusation.
You are simply ignoring how destructive this is to all the innocent people who get accused every single day because the trail of evidence wasn't complete or clear enough. 
If YOU were the one accused in all of those cases, and was innocent, and couldn't find a lawyer or get somebody else to pay, what would you do? If they said "no you can't have a lawyer so you don't even know what kind of evidence you need to present in the first case of the funds being legitimate", wouldn't you be mad?

Bitcoins aren't files. They are entries in the ledger (financial database) we call the blockchain. Once they're in a block they are yours, from then on it is only a matter of if your wallet client has detected the coins yet or not. Once the wallet is synced with the blockchain it should know about it and show you the money. Different clients sync in different ways, Bitcoin Core / Qt downloads the entire blockchain while Electrum asks servers about the block data to find the transactions.

Congratulations, your electricity costs are lower than that of ~98% of people and you got your miner cheap as well. 
Most people who try to mine are using shitty GPUs (far too often it is Nvidias, who are incredibly inefficient at it), use inefficient components, bad cooling, and have expensive electricity. 
Also, are you going to earn more in Bitcoins from it than you could have bought for the same amount of money? Even most miners who are profitable won't.

There are other free ones that also have acceptable performance although not quite as fast. But if all you need is to generate something like an RSA public key from inputs given by each participant, it isn't prohibitive.

Bitcoin is a little special here in that if there is only one person using it, then it is nothing more than a regular hash chain with some restrictions. Bitcoin is only valuable when multiple people agree that it is useful and see that others do too. If only one person in the world would see that it would be useful as money, it would still be worthless to him simply because he can't use it for anything until others agree with him.

Why is the verification code so short? That could enable an attacker to generate enough keys to end up creating a match.

Each transaction spends at least one input and sends it to at least one output (I think - is it possible to send everything as miner's fees directly?). Every output is only claimed once, any remains is sent as change (either to the originating address or a new one of your own) and becomes a new output that can be claimed later.
Since you only have to claim those dozens transactions *once*, and the next transaction only have to claim the single output from *that* transaction, the requirement to pay high fees *do not* carry over as that latter transaction will be smaller.

For comparison, Tor has centralized servers for finding peers and onion sites. Their hidden services is a protocol hack, not part of the original design. It's more unreliable and uses a single channel for all your connections while I2P has one per connection (better anonymity). If you're not browsing the plaintext net, Tor is shit.

I'll let the world show you that over the next few years. You probably won't be able to miss it. Let's just summarize it like this: the banking system creates useless barriers to trade that Bitcoin is free from, and the banking system can't guarantee absolute trust. Fraudulent chargebacks is a problem to tons of merchants, and Bitcoin is one of the few things that provide absolute protection against it. And it enables escrows that can operate similarly to PayPal, but which can not freeze or confiscate your money (PayPal has frozen funds without warning for all kinds of people and organizations, try a Google search; Bitcoin has m-of-n escrow transactions). 
Try international orders. We have a post here recently from a company selling scientific precision laboratory equipment internationally. They hated dealing with international bank transfers. They love Bitcoin. It's faster, more predictable, more reliable, cheaper, etc. 
It's programmable money. Most of the money related APIs out there can now be implemented without involving banks, and just right there you save tons of money in fees. 
Rice also have no intrisic value. But it's clearly cost effective at something, and people want it. 
But what if every criteria for why people want it was met better by something else that are at least as cheap, do you think it wouldn't get replaced?

I know how MPC works (which I called SMPC). 
You must be misreading it. 
Stage A, setting up the keypair: Everybody contributes a random number and the basic info for the election, out comes the public key, and an SSSS share for each of the participants of the private key plus a signed message with the provided election details. 
And for each new round those private key shares are inputs. 
MPC is by definition supposed to hide what is going on inside it (beyond knowing what code it runs, you don't know what data it was given by the others, it's a black box to you). 
An MPC that fails to hide the internal state is a bad MPC. And practically there isn't much of a difference between being able to hide who provided what input and hiding the internal state. Break one and you broke the other. 


I'm not talking about the IV or encryption nonce. It's part of the plaintext. The encryption process is supposed to NOT retain anything but the ciphertext when done. Ideally something like a smartcard being used to vote would make it impossible to get the encryption state out.

Yes, every transaction you received coins from is a separate input in your own transactions when you send coins. The wallet will bundle as many such inputs add required to make the payment. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:12:11
Uh, sure. You guys claimed it would essentially be instant, I said it wouldn't. 
Even at 10^-5 s/operation, that's approximately 100k 256 bit keys per 10 minute period (for each block). If most people will have wallets that spread out funds across a number of keys, with limited reuse, and there's a few billion users, then it's gonna take a long while to empty everything. I think the majority of coins will get protected in time even with a sudden attack out of the blue against Bitcoin.

Yeah, and those hacks typically get CC numbers and stuff like that. The equivalent of CC numbers for Bitcoin is addresses, and theft is impossible if you only know them, not the key. 
Strong security isn't really an option at all with credit cards. There are far too many ways to charge from a card without authorization. But with Bitcoin it is possible to achieve near perfect security. You can't have the equivalent of offline wallets with credit cards, your entire bank would have to be offline for that (and there's none left that isn't online).

Just FYI, there are secure methods to split up the private key in several parts so that you need over a chosen treshold number of them to restore it. So if one is stolen or lost there's no problem. You can have 2 of 3 required, or 4 of 7, or 53 or 86 or any other number you want.
Passguardian is one implementation for splitting it and restoring the key from the shares. You could test it out to see how it works. The algorithm in use is called Shamir's Secure Sharing Scheme.

That would be like saying multiple rounds of XOR is more secure than one. Nope, every state can be achieved by one round, so additional rounds only leads to a possibility of repetitions. You're past filling up the keyspace and now you're just looping through it.

If the mobile wallet only have the master public key it can NOT EVER send coins specifically because it only is capable of generating the public keys / addresses, it don't have the capability to generate the private keys required to sign the transactions. 
It is a watching-only wallet. 
The master public key is an ECDSA public key (using the secp256k1 variant like all Bitcoin clients), and a clever mathematical trick with ECDSA, a type of multiplication in a "field" that means you can derive new public keys from an existing public key in a way were you can derive the matching private keys from the original private key. 
Cracking the private key for any ECDSA public key with the secp256k1 variant is practically impossible (about 2^128 computations required, the current practical limit of bruteforce is assumed to be 2^80).

Actually, we could implement the Fawkes signature scheme to recover from this, by posting a hash commitment using a secure hash function of the transaction before the transaction is posted, because the private key can't broken until the public key has been published. This method shows you had the private key even before the public key was known.

With the exception for those who'd spend all their time EMP:ing everything, it could be beneficial to drive development in band sharing tech and MU-MIMO like what pCell and WiFi AC uses. Then there's also entirely new fields like using Orbital Angular Momentum to transfer multiple parallel signals on the same frequency.
Radio bandwidth isn't limited by physics, only by our current radio technology. Deploying a combination of all that new tech would boost our available bandwidth in any given area thousands of times over - and for long range radio, proper MIMO would increase it by millions of times (because of reduced overlap between signals).

I think I know a way of doing it that would rely on both Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and a type of hashes I'm unfortunately not certain exists. The general idea is to make sure miners only need a valid header (proven valid using ZKP) to be able to mine, and transactions would be bundled in groups in a tree-like manner. The type of hashes would work like enhanced Merkle hash trees (essentially behaving like a list of hashes, but combined into one root) with ZKPs of validity and allow you to detect if two bundles have conflicting hashes (doublespends) or not, and allow merging of hash roots together with creating a new ZKP of validity for the merged roots.
The idea is that every store chain and their transactions to their HQ's servers which creates a bundle (independent stores and services can have contracts with local trade organizations for doing the same), and then these bundles are merged, and miners only need the roots of the bundles with a ZKP. The transactions are also propagated to full Bitcoin nodes. 
The actual transactions (UTXOs) only need to be known by the recipients in order to allow them to spend their coins. There would be various services gathering all transactions, it would work like torrents with "supernodes" (regular nodes have partial data as they don't need to have all of it). Think of it like Electrum servers with some extra cryptographic magic. 
Doing it without that type of hashes would require managing the full lists of transactions instead, and would mean only large servers are capable of performing merges of the lists. Miners would still only need a Merkle tree hash of the transactions with a ZKP, but fewer entities would be capable of generating transactions bundles for them to mine on. So it is still possible, but more bandwidth heavy.

Cryptocurrency ideas dated back at least to the 80's or earlier. The idea wasn't new. Look into cypherpunks and their discussions on the matter. 
The thing is that they all were still centralized, no matter how hard they tried to limit the necessary trust in the server. All of them had gatekeepers.
Creating blockchain cryptocurrencies with the intent to spy on it would obviously be highly prone to backfire, and they should really have known that in advance - just look at coinjoin and Zerocoin. Without gatekeepers these things can't be prevented.
That no big entity is publicly fighting it is likely a result of not understanding the appeal of the system before it essentially got as entrenched as it is now (too many hackers worldwide willing to defend it if necessary) or of simply not understanding the incentives and thus not believing it could work. Essentially what happened to Nokia the last decade. 
If there's any big entities out there now that would want to fight Bitcoin, they aren't doing it publicly because they got caught off guard and realized it was too late by now. Fighting it publicly now would almost certainly backfire. Any fighting is done silently behind the scenes, through discrediting it, preventing interoperability, excessive regulations, etc.

When you're the first to get paid with printed money, you haven't experienced loss in demand of each unit of money because it haven't yet propagated to enough of the market for the demand to adjust.
But once the money starts to propagate, the market notices (indirectly) that the supply of money have gone up and thus the demand per unit drops.
Poor people usually are the last in line to take part of that money, and by then they've already experienced loss of purchasing power due to dropping demand per unit of money. And their wages also often lag behind.
So different parts of the market effectively experience different levels of inflation.

If there's a worry about 51% attacks between the planets, then you could attempt to generate planet-wide secrets that aren't to be shared with anybody off the planet that could be used to for example sign all proof-of-work from the planet, so only people from planet X can mine on their own blockchain. This might not work if there's a significant risk of anybody on the planet sharing that secret for profit (such doing it in return for getting cryptocurrency).
You could also do automatic continous checkpointing on the blockchain at somewhere below T*2 (because the attacker both have to generate their own longer chain and then send it back to that planet, so if block X already is checkpointed when a chain arrives that starts at X-1, the attacker fails) and refuse blocks whose timestamps goes too far into the future (already being done). Note that such checkpointing creates a risk of the network being "forked" if new nodes or idle nodes see the longer chain before the local one, those nodes would then have to be manually reset by the users.

I've read it before. There's no "shill imperative" to be found anywhere here. 
Only publishing a fork of length N gives you no advantage when the other chains are equally long. If you have a longer chain, why publish it at all? Wait until the others have created additional blocks on the other fork, wasting even more power for them when you publish yours. If your chain is shorter, you failed. You lost the lottery and wasted all of your mining power. Due to variance, eventually a large fraction of miners will go bankrupt because of this (due to too many losses in a row). 
The point of selfish mining is that sometimes you'll have a chain of N+1 or more, in which case you'll have wasted the work of others, and because of that your fraction of the work going into the winning chain is then greater than your fraction of the total mining power. And when there's competing forks (several chains of length N), your chance of winning is of course 1/N. Hopefully for you this number will be larger than your fraction of the total mining power. That's how it allows you to gain an advantage over regular miners.
If everybody is selfish mining individually, you'll have somebody publishing their chain constantly because somebody needs to pay their bills. 
And even the most powerful individual miners will eventually lose enough work to other longer chains that it turns into a really shitty lottery. You amplify the variance. You know why pools came around? To reduce variance. 
And for the previously mentioned reasons, selfish mining pools will have detractors frequently. They aren't sustainable. 
A case where everybody mines selfishly is like a prisoner's dilemma where the potential profit from sole detraction is minimal, where you make a loss rather than just walking away with nothing if both detract, and where the profit is consistent if everybody is honest. The risks with detraction is too great. Even if you're the only selfish miner at first, you might trigger others to start as well until it becomes unprofitable for you for long enough for you to be forced to stop. 
There's too many conflicting incentives outside what the raw math for the statistics say you might gain. 
Not to mention that large scale selfish mining would cause the price of the coins to drop, *ensuring* a loss. 
Its like a version of Mutual Assured Destruction of everybody would do it.

Because it is cheaper with Bitcoin. All the most common forms of CC fraud are eliminated by it, leaving multisignature arbitrators and escrows with far fewer cases to handle and thus lower overhead. 
Bitpay and Coinbase can eliminate the extra step for you anyway. There's more companies like them too. 
And when more and more use services like them, more people find themselves able to pay for everything in Bitcoins, allowing them to take the Bitcoins directly without selling them (Bitpay allow you to receive a chosen percentage in Bitcoins and the rest in fiat, so you can increase that over time). 
And then we have all the features like smart contracts, and much more.

If they managed to cover all other tracks too, yes. Anti-money-laundering laws is meant to make that harder. It is very similar to how countries like China try to block all anonymous communication to ensure tracks exist. 
But either you allow for tracks to be covered for almost everybody, or for almost nobody. If those in charge aren't "friendly", you want them to be able to cover their tracks. But those tools are usable by everybody everywhere, including criminals. 
So either you choose to let nobody do it and take the consequences of that, or you let everybody do it and accept that set of consequences instead. So which set of consequences do you prefer?

I'm just describing what I think would end up happen in such a system. Sometimes I see arguments I feel is hypocritical or unfounded simply because there's no reason to believe their option wouldn't end up the same or worse, so the switch wouldn't actually be beneficial. I can understand wanting to remove something bad, but if you can't assure it won't get *worse*, why should you get your way? You don't cut your foot of for a mosquito bite. 
Because if a transition is going to be made, somebody WILL NEED to find the solutions, and you can't just wish for somebody else to do it some day in the future. I have more respect for those actually building something useful such as open source contributors, but you're going to need a more "systemic" approach. Obviously there would be no one true answer, and even less so in an anarchistic system, but a few different complete solutions would just be better then. Show it can work, and then we can start the comparisons to see if a switch is worth it.

The whole point of mining is to test random numbers as a part of proof-of-work. If you succeed, you can publish your block. The block has a mining payout transaction that goes to the miner. 
In a block, the pool server looks like a single miner outwards, because it publishes blocks that looks like any other. We only really know most pools by their reuse of payout known public addresses. 
Then the pool pays the miners that take work from them. 
And the proof-of-work algorithm allows for measuring approximate performance by allowing miners to send in close matches to the pool, as they don't need to send every hash, and this allows the pool to calculate the contribution of each miner to calculate payouts from.
This is because we simply are looking for a number that is low enough as the block hash, and the output of SHA256 is essentially random. This means that miners also can send in all numbers that they find that are within for example 1/1000 of the target (the precise details differ), and thus the pool can see that one miner contributed with 500 such close numbers, and one with 300 and one with 200. And all of them produces blocks that pay the pool. Then the pool pay them, splitting the payouts between the miners. 
We could in theory maybe stop pools by figuring out a proof-of-work protocol where close matches look no different from any other random output, such that only exact matches can be verified as "useful". Then we break the pool's method of tracking contributed power, so nobody wants to mine in a pool anymore because it doesn't benefit them. But I don't think it's meaningful to try - P2Pool already makes the problem disappear (if it grows large enough), and what if they find a workaround for tracking computational contributions another way?

You could generate a single malicious fork for all your targets *if you don't need them to see different data from each other*.
If you want to prevent A from seeing B's payment they can't be on the same chain, and if both A and B needs to see fake chains you need to create two chains rather than isolating just one of them.
Same if you want to doublespend against 100 merchants with one coin, you can't send that one coin to all of them in the same chain, THEN they'd all need different forks of the chain (taking massive hashing power). 
Also note that transactions in the fake chain that still would be valid on the task chain can be rebroadcasted to it and be included. So if you want to stop a transaction from being able to go through on the real chain you need to cause a doublespend of one or more of the UTXO's claimed. But if you didn't create it, you can't necessarily cause it to happen (the user's wallet client need to create a new conflicting transaction, possibly requiring social engineering on your part). 
So to stop a transaction between A and B, you need to make A create a new transaction after the first one made to B (possibly by reversing the block in the fake it was included in (creating a new fork with two blocks), so the wallet clears out the first transaction) to then get him to make a payment to you that conflicts with the first one (this payment is sent to the real chain by you). If B is on the same initial fake chain as A he see (the now invalidated) transaction. If not, he never gets it. You may prefer the latter, if you want to select exactly what transactions he sees.

You can say that the miners vote on which version of the history should be considered valid by contributing computing power to extend it's total amount of proof-of-work (trying to create a new block to add to the blockchain).
The version of history (chain of blocks) with the greatest account of proof-of-work (as a result of having the greatest account of total computing power behind it) is collectively accepted as the canonical version (how consensus is established).
Your wallet and other non-mining nodes don't add "votes", but they accept the consensus of the rest of the network if that chain follows the rules of the protocol that they themselves have encoded (your wallet won't accept a chain with invalid blocks no matter the amount of proof-of-work behind it).
Voting no would mean you're mining on a separate fork of the chain (another version of history) where you may apply different rules. Unless others chose to modify their clients to go with your fork, you'll essentially have nothing but toy money in your chain because nobody else values the coins in your chain.

In Bitcoin you have a reasonable assurance the history you see is the one the majority agree on even if you just know one other node. You can't destroy it simply with a sybil attack (many malicious nodes), only DDoS. It practically guarantees concensus can be restored even if all nodes disagree (have different forks). Even HQ in there can tolerate f faults for 3f+1 replicas which means if more than 1 per 4 or 3 per 10 are faulty / malicious nodes it breaks. Bitcoin only needs &gt;1 honest miners per 1 malicious or faulty miner (assuming equal power per node), with any number of malicious non-miners tolerated.

You need to create 2^80 addresses to find a single collision between your own *empty* addresses, on average. That's about the same as the number of hashes the Bitcoin miners have calculated since the start - but that's 2xSHA256, and Bitcoin address generation is ECDSA public key derivation + SHA256 + RIPEMD160, and ECDSA is a few dozen times slower, at least, than the hashes. So the computational power required for that is far more intense. 
2^80 symmetric crypto operations is about what's assumed that large organizations like NSA can bruteforce (maybe a bit more now, that's a few years old estimation). So that would be absurdly costly for no good.

RC4 is broken if the attacker has at least a few MB worth of the stream in a format that don't hide the statistical patterns\*, and including the first thousand bits (those are more biased than the rest). *Not saying it should be used anymore though, as better options exists.*
\* If it is hashed or encrypted or OTP'd (XOR'ed with random bits), etc, that hides the patterns which is what would allow an attacker to crack it and find the key. ECDSA public key calculation from 256 bits used as private key should hide the patterns well enough. The critical thing here is that RC4 don't have an effectively reduced/small keyspace, unlike for example raw DES where you can crack anything done with it. You can't guess all streams.
But RC4 stream as a single layer of XOR encryption is crackable when the plaintext has known statistical properties that can be "filtered out" to make it easier to detect the statistical biases in the raw stream that allows for deriving the key.

In this scenario there would explicitly not be a 90% majority honest miners. There'd be something like a 20% selfish pool and a bunch of 5-15% pools, of which one or a few honest and the rest selfish. (Precise numbers aren't important right now, just approximate ratios.)

Interoperable means being able to use two clients with each other without a translating proxy. Bitcoin isn't interoperable with fiat because bitwage and Bitpay exists. Those are external services.

Also, because this scenario kills of the the unique selling point for most of the unique cryptocurrencies, the benefit is lost unless those who want to u use the feature - wait for it - takes on the switching costs of supporting use of that feature.

What you mean is you can tell merchants (or your bank) to contact Paypal and wait for customer service to reply. 


So you admit that you have chosen to ignore progress, that Bitcoin DOES work today, and that it just gets easier to use over time. You are not rejecting it because of its inherent limitations or capabilities, you're rejecting it *entirely, permanently* because it isn't perfect *yet*.
By your logic, nobody should use computers because the first computers sucked. Nobody should bother trying to make them usable for normal people, because OBVIOUSLY it can't ever be good because the first version wasn't good enough. Same for cars, bet you don't ever use one of those. Because the first cars had no security and was slow and shitty. Right? Or not. So why are you using computers and cars? Because somebody worked to make it better, and people judged the new versions on *their* properties, not on the past history.


Wrong AGAIN. A large fraction of fraudulent charges are NOT automatically reversed. You are forced to deal with it, because your bank can't read your mind. If anybody gets your CC details, you can't stop fraud.
You are yet again rejecting progress and history. Did the first CC cards have all that bundled? Do you really think that? No. So why aren't you rejecting CC cards? Because it changed over time, it was made simpler. You are rejecting Bitcoin entirely because of the current implementation. You aren't even willing to consider its future potential. But that's blatant hypocrisy because you have chosen to accept the fact that it took time for the systems and services you seem to love to reach that level which it is at now.
You will NOT need to deal with that with Bitcoin in the future. You will chose wallets not much different than how you chose a CC today. You will go by recommendations by people and companies around you.


So you're linking to the equivalent of leaving your safe *open* on your lawn to prove your point. Using a Trezor or the wallet Copay makes it close to impossible to steal your money.


I like how you're redefining what trivial means. So how do you sign up for a CC? You pick one with terms you approve of, write down your name and address and sign it, send it in and wait. With Bitcoin wallets, just install one with defaults you approve of, and on first install you have the OPTION of entering your name and address for usage with things like BIP70 (payment protocol), so that when you pay with Bitcoin you don't even need to enter your address manually. Just click "pay", the wallet opens, you approve of the order details, and enter your PIN/password. How is that not trivial? It is even EASIER than using a CC.


Except when they don't work, like when Paypal freeze your funds and waits 6 months to unlock them. And except when Visa and Mastercard blocks your transactions because the recipient/merchant has been blacklisted despite being 100% legal.


And here we have this marvelous display of hypocrisy again. You reject Bitcoin because it wasn't perfect at release, yet nothing of what you prefer instead of it had anything of what you're demanding at release.


Define "doesn't work". There's a major difference between "not optimal for me" and "can't be done with it".


Well thanks for proving how ignorant you are, clearly you should be mocking the people who are actively trying to solve its problems. Yet you would never dare to do the same with the people building the first cars, the first CC company, the people building the first computers, etc. But why not? Why this emotional difference in reaction?

The txID of transactions already in the blockchain is static, those that you send can right now be modified to get a different txID while still doing the same thing, which means your transactions can end up in the blockchain with another txID than the one your version of the transaction had.

Are you aware of the combination I2P and Tahoe-LAFS? The former is probably known to you already, and Tahoe-LAFS is a distributed encrypted storage system. The I2P configuration of it mimics Freenet and let you publish documents in a serverless manner where any Tahoe-LAFS node can replicate it. Write access and read access is separate, and cryptographically enforced. So you can publish a document where you can give read access to some people and read-write access to others. 
There's a publicly editable Tiddlywiki on Tahoe-LAFS, then there's Bote mail which uses DHT for distribution, I2P Messenger which is serverless too, etc... 
IMHO it has more potential as it can do everything Freenet can, while also being more flexible. I2P is designed for traffic anonymization and to offer simple APIs for third party software to communicate over the network.
Not to diminish Freenet, but I think it is a dead end. Like how there's great gas cars, but electric will simply deprecate them one day. There's limitations in it I2P don't have.

On Bitcoin, every block is based on the previous one as an input. CPU time spent on looking for a solution to one isn't usable for any fork where the latest block differs with a single bit from the version you are mining on. You can not get better performance by mining on several differnt blocks at once, because that give you less CPU time on each fork. So you want to mine based on the block that has the greatest chance to end up in the chain permanently (the last one in the longest known chain).
With POS you only have to sign a proof of owning a certain amount of coins, and having owned them for a certain amount of time, to contribute to the POS mining process. The longer they've been unused the better ("bitcoin-days destroyed" is the relevant concept), and that uses up the eligibility for those coins' age to be used in mining (they can be used again later, but the bitcoin-days is reset to zero every time you mine with them, giving them less voting wheight in mining).
But signing is computationally trivial, and if you see a fork you didn't sign a proof in get longer than the one you did for, you can just sign the same proof there *because within that fork* your bitcoin-days destroyed have *not yet been spent* on mining. So you lose nothing on mining on every single fork you see, so it's trivial to create double-spend blocks because everybody but the recipient have an incentive to mine on it, because if it happens to be the one that ends up in the blockchain you'll lose out *if you don't* but you don't lose anything if you do.

No, it's decentralized. Bote mail uses DHT over I2P for mail delivery and public keys for addressing and encryption. Tahoe-LAFS over I2P uses a local gateway that talks to a network of peers (no central server) to fetch data in a decentralized manner (any node can be a storage node for any data, just like Freenet), and data are cryptographically addressed. 
Tahoe-LAFS doea have separate read-write and read-only permissions, but that's cryptographically managed with cryptographic authentication. That's not tied to the capability of any particular node, but to keys in the possession of the publisher of the data. 
I2P has software like Syndie, I2P Messenger, Bote mail, Tahoe-LAFS, a number of torrent clients, the DHT system Seedless that is intended for searching for various public resources (bote mail addresses with name, Tahoe-LAFS files, torrent magnet links, etc). It has an API for software to use to automatically create any number of incoming tunnels (like Tor's hidden services). It has better performance and is more reliable. 
Git over I2P exists (although I think they mostly use monotone, and Tahoe-LAFS can work for that too). Fossil is being used for decentralized wiki by some. IRC over I2P exists. So does forums, including the decentralized Syndie. 
The garlic routing which IMHO improves on Tor's onion routing beats the friend-to-friend routing Freenet primarily uses regarding traffic anonymization (it is harder to tell where packets originate or stop, for example, as all nodes route, through random nodes). 
Fundamentally I2P is a traffic anonymization system that works like a network of proxies, and that provides simple API:s for client software. On top of that you can build anything. Anything currently decentralized but identifiable because of the traffic being public can be anonymized and stay decentralized using I2P.

To not cause any limiting bottlenecks in the design, what you need is to directly give the quantum computer the all the inputs to the block directly, which means you have to encode the data of all the transactions of the block and the current time and the hash of the previous block into the qubits.
So you need enough qubits to represent that data - at least several tens of thousands just for that.
Then you need to program it to shuffle around the order of the transactions as needed, calculate a merkle tree hash of that, and then calculate two rounds of SHA256 on that, and then compare that with the target value.
That will drastically increase the complexity, further increase how many qubits you need due to the algorithmic overhead, AND the probability of a correct output per round of running the quantum computer will be absurdly low (quantum computers will give the correct answer with a certain probability better than random - and the more complex the problem, the closer to fully random).
And that's assuming you even can program it and run at least a full round with such a complex problem within 10 minutes.

So it is indistinguishable from the security of Ripple (a set of privileged nodes agree on which transactions is valid, and in what order) until transactions are in the blockchain. 
But if I don't trust the masternodes, I can't be certain it is confirmed until the miners include it in a block (there's literally no way around this, no matter what math you use).

They are limited, yes, as in if you divide it among all people on earth evenly, everybody will only get a certain fraction. 21 million / 7 billion = 0.003 BTC or 3 mBTC.
Actually, the denomination isn't interesting at all when you think of economies in global terms, it is the fractions and total values that really matter. Let's say you've got 100 million dollars. You're rich then, right? Because most people have less, so it's valuable. But if everybody else had 1000 billion? How much would they want your 100 million then? You suddenly have a far smaller fraction.
Now, with Bitcoin - you can offer somebody 100 million billionths of a coin. They already have much more. Why would they value it so highly? You have to compare how large of a fraction each person hold relative to the total economy. If there's 1000 people and you have 1/3 of the value, you're rich. If you have 1/100 000 of the value among those 1000, you're probably poor.
Since you can't just move the decimals in Bitcoin, you can't go from having a value measured in mBTC to dozens of BTC. If you have a given fraction and others have more, you have less than them, and your total value is less than theirs. And vice versa. It doesn't matter if you split your coins into satoshis, they can too. You have 300 000 satoshis, but the guy who had 2 BTC then has 200 000 000 satoshis.
If somebody is willing to offer a larger fraction of the total value in exchange than you can offer, your offer will lose out.

Still by definition not a pyramid scheme. Maybe you can compare it to trading cards if you don't want to compare it to stocks or gold. But ones that can't be reprinted infinitely. While pump-and-dump schemes are possible, that has nothing at all to do with the nature of the protocol.


Repeating the nitpick: No encryption. Hashes and digital signatures are used. It's a token in a ledger.


What about Apple? No dividends, and they have a huge untouched cash stash. Still high share prices. But unless you have enough shares for your votes to count, they don't represent anything tangible at all to the owner.


On what grounds do you say there's going to be more information available for failing companies than for Bitcoin? You aren't even trying to model a failure mode/scenario for it. What kind of failure? Security hole, altcoin taking over, being replaced by another type of tech entirely (such as the federated Ripple, while Bitcoin is decentralized), being abandoned because it's too hard to use (such as because of goverment attack against exchanges), etc...?
And there's still no guarantee you'll get much back from a company going bankrupt. It's not like every single company going bankrupt have been a pinnacle of transparency either. There are often multiple creditors that end up going without anything at all as some creditors had priority and there weren't enough to pay the rest.
Also, for services like Mt Gox that's not a part of the Bitcoin protocol. It's like questioning gold because of the failure of a company handling gold. And there's now also multiple Bitcoin exchanges that use proof-of-reserve methods to prove they control as many Bitcoins as they claim, and that also have had USD reserve audits. And they've got much better security (in particular the multisignature ones). So the risk of another Mt Gox like failure is just going down with time.


And that's why the stock market so often is considered gambling?


You haven't provided any real reason for why it shouldn't have any value, why it would need any backing by a state, what would make the security worse or why the unique features it has wouldn't count into it's utility.
What is it that you are asking of it exactly?
How quickly should it become stable and how is that supposed to happen? Would you rather have a centralized system where a something like a central bank can issue new tokens at will and prop up the value? The whole point of Bitcoin is to be *decentralized*. There's actually people who want it just because hyperinflation is literally impossible. Like you know, people who live in countries that have shitty currencies that have been hyperinflated.
Seems like the only data I can find right now is USD M2 growing by approximately 2x since 2008.


What part of it natural? Being traditional isn't the same as natural. It's created by humans, not naturally occuring.
What's the point with forcing investments? You're driving the risktaking up above what it otherwise naturally would have been.




Then you're reading me wrong. And why exactly doesn't it have any value, again? Can it only have value if a large goverment is propping up it's value?


What's a source of value, then? People wanting to get it because they want to use it and offering something in exchange seems to be what you think counts, and that's what would happen for Bitcoin just like I said, but for some reason you're either applying different rules to Bitcoin or you're leaving out details. And again, the blockchain has far more uses than simply exchange.


Because you don't have to prove your claims?


And in order to be used for that globally, the total value of the Bitcoin supply needs to grow first. Then once the market is "saturated", the growth will slow down and speculation will go down with it. There's pretty much ALWAYS speculation around anything that's gaining in value. I believe it's going to keep growing, but I can't say when or where it will stop, and I have no idea about which rate it will grow at until then. There's too many variables involved (goverment acceptance, usage by large corporations, public perception, etc), it's just not predictable. But I know that there are tons of usecases that will appear in the future (such as smart contracts and smart property that I previously mentioned that not yet are in use) that will contribute to demand when they arrive. We'll have to wait and see!
I feel like you're rejecting Bitcoin with the same kind of arguments used against electric cars. "There's no infrastructure for it, they're more expensive, the range is too limited, they're too weak", etc... Ignoring that most of it will be solved (and not always in the way you expected!), and that they'll bring advantages that by far outweigh the disadvantages. You're arguing from the viewpoint of what it's like today as if nothing ever will change.

Also, what about isolation attacks? If I MITM their WiFi using reaver to get in and aarp spoofing to intercept requests, won't my 10 masternodes which then is the only ones he can connect to become his default nodes to ask? Because all other nodes would appear to be offline.
And I doubt most people would rather live of transaction fees than of massive holdings. Wealth like that isn't easy to keep if you want to live like a rich man.

You'd only care about proving it is close, so you use two trusted nodes. The storage agent just can't reply fast enough to both of them to look like he is closer to both than half the distance between the trusted nodes (in other words, if he is in the middle between the two he can't make it look like he is closer than that to either of them). 
So you use storage nodes closer to your first trusted node than the middle to the next trusted node. Drawn circles around each trusted node such that they don't overlap, and only use storage nodes within those circles.

The server don't care, really. It says "prove you have access, here's unique challenge string X and my public key" and then your software remembers what it used for that site and creates a response after asking you for the relevant inputs. Then it generates a proof of them being correct while encrypting it with a key the server don't even need to know (Yay Zero-knowledge proofs). 
The encrypted response + the strings given by the server + the proof validates if it is correct. 
It is the user's software that has to take into account which is what when generating the proof.

That still doesn't prove that your version of it is flawless and without contradiction. Just that it is on average more successful given certain goals than the other options. The problem is when you claim it is objective and complete. 
I showed you examples of situations where there are no clear resolution despite knowing that somebody likely is to be considered to have done wrong. Again, consider a response to a false perceived threat, and the counterresponse. The first person acted in fear, the second person retaliated, possibly even out off proportion.  If the second person respond unproportionally, can he get away with it because the initial attack against him was unjustified? Or does both get punished? 
Also, I still haven't seen any good definition for when something becomes property of a person.

Yes, scrypt ASICs are more expensive to build, so fewer can afford building them cost-effectively. Which is exactly why it's so stupid in the first place.
Either we've go for an algorithm designed to only work efficiently on our current most common CPU architectures by using EVERY SINGLE FEATURE in them as heavily as possible in a specific way (so an ASIC would be pointless to build because it would only be a somewhat faster regular CPU), in which case botnets will dominate, or we go for something that can be computed efficiently with circuits that are cheap to build so that anybody can build them such that they eventually will end up everywhere.

Option  doesn't work all that well, because the P2Pool chain is a rolling one, so new P2Pool nodes (which in this case would be all Bitcoin nodes) can't verify if the older blocks really were generated using P2Pool as claimed or not.
Any node can fake their blocks being P2Pool blocks. But P2Pool nodes that are online while it's announced can confirm if the shares match the chain or not.

Are you using the purely financial definition of intrinsic value (has uses other than just for finance, i.e. industrially)? If you use that term here without clarification of what you mean you might end up in a heavily semantical argument as people here don't like calling value of any kind "intrinsic" as many people here only would consider value to be derived from context (i.e. you wouldn't trade away your last water in the desert for any amount of gold, but you'd give it away instantly if you're in the middle of a city where getting more water is easy).
How do you consider gold more scarce? 2 100 000 000 000 000 satoshis is the max, and with the amount of gold in the world at 171 300 000 kg there is 81.6 µg (micrograms) per satoshi, or 12 259 satoshi per gram of gold. We are already capable of dividing gold in smaller pieces than that, although it would take an excessive amount of work.
And talking about relative scarcity with digital tokens seems like a purely philosophical argument. Just see the altcoin onecoin, and Dogecoin which have a tiny base unit. Since changing the precision is a matter of a software patch, it can change at a rapid pace like nothing else.

Any size group of users together with a single miner or more can create a new fork with new rules and agree on using it. 
That's altcoins, essentially. 
Overtaking the regular Bitcoin chain requires convincing the economic majority of Bitcoin users (like large exchanges and merchants and holders), forcing the rest to tag along to avoid seeing their funds in the old version of the chain lose all their value. This would make the miners come along because mining on this chain would be more profitable.

Also, some fill algorithms are very convincing, so cutting out the the text overlayed over a photo and extrapolating a fill from the surrounding area (works even better after fetching the nearby pieces of the image with the method above), could fool the user.

If your scheme becomes common, it would be used by hackers when doing bruteforce attempts. Regular bruteforce works fine against the most common passwords, your system wouldn't slow it down. 
Scrypt and bcrypt slows them down, however. By several millions of times. They can't test nearly as many possible passwords.

A system can't prove itself. What you end up with is having to make some assumptions, and from them you can prove that what you stated is semantically correct and doesn't violate your definitions. 
Usually you have assumptions that are reasonably simple and that can be assumed to be correct. But of course it happens that your assumptions are flawed. 
Like SSL recently where somebody proved with some assumptions that the protocol as specified is secure - for a single connection! Then somebody else came up with threeshake, where you first perform an incomplete MITM and break the connection, where you then use the data you gathered from that connection to perform a full MITM later on (using that data to initiate "session resumption" pretending to be that client). The proof didn't consider reuse of data in other sessions.

Federated transaction verification, centralized issuance of coins (although anybody can be their own central issuer of their own private coins). 
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:58:34
Yes, it is still yours. Bitcoin handles coins kind of like gold, it takes a bunch of pieces (previous transactions sent to you, used as inputs), "melts them down" into one sum, and splits it among the recipients (as outputs, any remainder after sending the sum of choice to the recipient is sent back to you as an output AND/OR to the miners as a transaction fee) 
By the way, tell the offline Armory to generate more addresses. Sooner or later it should regenerate the same one you see being used for change in the referenced transaction. If you do, you can be sure it is safe. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 12:48:00
Why those 10? How is the security of that selection enforced? Why doesn't it work with any other 10? Is the selection dependent on the transaction inputs? What if I change everything but one input to doublespend?

You can say it's the first solution with a given set of properties (which it is). It is fully decentralized, unlike the solutions that for example are designed to keep multiple datacenters belonging to the same organization in sync. You can invite an arbitary number of untrusted third party nodes, while most of those solutions rely on some kind of gatekeeper.
Based on how I read the Wiki article, the signature dependent systems use signatures to prove conflicting commands being sent from the same node. This only works if there's some kind of gatekeeper and all nodes must be authenticated, otherwise you can perform a sybil attack to issue the conflicting commands from different nodes with different keypairs signing them.


But such an attack also only have a temporary effect on the network.
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:04:29
Pretty much. Multiply your private key with all other public keys, and everybody else do the same. This is not far from how simple ECDH key exchange works, but done in a group. 
There's also ECDSA group signatures, where everybody contribute to the same signature using their separate keypairs, without merging the actual keys.

Quantum computers do factoring, some optimization problems and related problems very fast.
RSA is based on factoring, and the ECDSA math is related to factoring in a roundabout way such that quantum computers can break them too using a modified version of the algorithm that otherwise would be used against RSA (Shor's algorithm). 
Stealth addresses, ring signatures and all that is still ECDSA.

Note that this scheme is essentially secret sharing combined with Secure Multiparty Computation so that there is no plaintext reconstruction in order to sign.

Addresses where the public key already is known (reused addresses) is directly vulnerable. 
The rest can be protected by Fawkes signatures - you commit to the transaction going to an address based on a different algorithm before publishing it (publish a hash of it in the blockchain first), and quantum computers can't crack hashes (Grover's algorithm halves the keyspace, but 128 bits remain strong enough). So any other transaction from the address than the one that matches the commitment is rejected. 
McEliece and others are quantum resistant.

Source? IIRC most purchases are done with just the CC number (such as online), not with the physical card in hand. You can ONLY spend from hardware wallets with it in hand and with the PIN.
The replacement isn't free, it's paid for through the CC fees.
You can also have your keys on your hardware wallet backed up, even to a second hardware wallet in a safe at home. And with multisignature services, there's just no way at all to hack the service to steal money, and they (like GreenAddress.it) can implement the same type of protections such as spending limits and behaviour analysis that banks do so your money can't suddenly be spent abroad.

Android enforce code signing for updates. Malware can't read other apps' private data or memory unless they got root access, making it equal in security to iOS once the malware is installed. And malware needs to be installed by the user in the first place. 
Android L is fortunately getting encryption enabled by default. Also, this don't have any relevancy for malware as encryption protects against "offline" attackers. 
Updates is one problem, but that isn't the fault of Android. The carriers shouldn't be interfering in the first place. If you want updates you can switch to another ROM like Cyanogenmod. 
Regarding secure isolated software, I've been thinking about similar solutions like that. A secure device which can use hardware switches to disable access for the main OS to the screen and all sensors in order to prevent stuff like spying on the input by listening to the accelerometers, etc. And to prevent "phishing" from malware it would need something like its own LED to signal when it is active and in exclusive control of the screen. ARM already has a mechanism for running software in a way similar to this, which potentially could be used.
One of the problems with this approach is however that most types of TPM's are designed to give the manufacturer control over the user, not to give the user ultimate control.

Are you interested in supporting zero-knowledge proofs in the future such as zk-SNARK:s? They would allow near-instant verification of even highly complex scripts since it is the one who created it which spent his computational power at generating a quickly verifiable cryptographic proof of validity.
You could potentially even chain together proofs such that you can prove the validity of thousands of scripts at once, and you could even use it as a trustless checkpointing mechanism where all previous scripts could be identified with a Merkle hash tree and an accompanying proof of validity, allowing you to instantly trust that all those scripts followed the protocol correctly.

Being part of the "rebel forces" *is the default for everybody* if you stick with the old client.

1) This isn't IBM Watson. Multisignature support libraries already exist, you only need to create a new multisignature P2SH address with your public key, the merchant's and the arbitrator's, and send the coins to it. The wallet does this automatically once you approved a payment request over BIP70 which asks for using an arbitrator. The merchant's wallet accepts that as a payment. The arbitrator is sent a copy of the details he need to do his job. 
2) So you're using Visa or Mastercard. That's two major choices across the entire globe. With arbitrators it is 10000x easier to compete fairly, and there's no lock-in, so even if the merchant don't accept the one you're using them you can still pay like if it was cash. 
3) lol. You don't want to understand my point? The arbitrator don't need to charge you for transactions in which neither side file a complaint because it just doesn't cost them anywhere near 2.9% per transaction to automatically accept an arbitration assignment. 
4) Uh, yes you do. Have you no clue about how many troubles people frequently have with their banks? Things like wrong fees, high fees, little competition, low protection against fraud, slow transactions, etc... Many banks essentially acts like comcast and extracts as much money as they can. And shit like arbitrarily changing the order in which charges and transactions is applied to an account such that if you had 50, transferred in 100 and spent 70 twice (even if hours apart), they first charged your account 70, charged overdraft fees, charged another 70, charged overdraft fees, and then credited 150. If the fees were at say 20 each, you were then at -30. Yes, this has been extremely common and is essentially punitive against poor people.  
There's like a billion Nokias with cameras. They're perfectly capable of doing this too. 
You described the process for somebody already inside the CC system as if it was a natural constant that it is unnatural to be outside, and compared it to the situation for somebody new to Bitcoin, in a biased way. That is deceptive. 
5) It has to do with all the other steps CC companies don't even deal with. BIP70 can transparently transfer all kinds of data to automate everything which can be done in an automated fashion (agreeing to return policies and all). 
You're ignoring the fact that this insurance you're talking about frequently denies fraud reports, and even this happens you have no choice but to fight them. The contract don't help much of you can't get them to agree on the interpretation as well as on what happened. This is what I mean with the chip and PIN comment - they'll claim they're no longer liable because of the involvement of the chip. They've done their job, according to them. 
No bank here will pay you back anything near the full amount if you were considered to have been careless. If love to see a link to the TOS from a bank that says otherwise. 
Relatively easy = call for days. Wait for weeks. Get half the money back. 
They're also easier to steal from a careful CC user than from a careful Bitcoin user. False negatives (the bank calling you) doesn't prove there's no false positives (approving fraudulent transactions).

By guessing which transactions most nodes will know of the pending transactions you included in your block, and then announcing the block header and using clever math to generate a fixed size blob of data which lets the recipient figure out which of their transactions were included in the block, and also if they have all of the transactions that were included. If they have all the transactions they can instantly check if they were all already verified as valid (your node does this as soon as it sees any new transactions), don't conflict, and generate the same Merkle tree hash that was in the announced header. If all those checks passes, you have a new valid block.

But that is what the definition of theft *require*.
Even with passwords, your only method of taking exclusive control of what I used to have is to *replace* the password, before you replace it you don't have exclusive control of something I don't. And afterwards you no longer have the password, therefore it isn't the password that was stolen (rather *control of the account* was stolen at the point you changed passwords).
How is piracy stopping anybody from selling their work? Have you ever noticed how the movies that's on the top 100 list on TPB makes millions in profits?
Unauthorized access, copyright infringement, etc, but by definition not ever *theft*.

In case you decide to store Bitcoins yourself, I would recommend using multisignature P2SH addresses, so that multiple people is required to sign transactions, for the long term storage ("hot wallets" with smaller sums don't need the same level of security). That means that even if one of them would get malware or something like it (or go rouge), the Bitcoins can't get stolen because one signature isn't enough to move the coins.

My point is that almost every single one of those protections can be replicated with Bitcoin (and they will be easy to use), and many can be outclassed by it and even obsoleted by it (a public key don't need the same protection as a CC number). 
This isn't a matter of "if", it's a matter of continuous progress. We already know about a large number of things that can be done that is just waiting to be implemented in a way that is easy to use (right now what we need the most is skilled interface designers).

You can also use P2SH addresses (pay to script hash). Then you can only spend from it using that particular script, which would include a locktime. So you just make an address like that, spend to it normally, and keep it's key. Once it's time to spend, you use it to spend.

It isn't that easy in many cases, unfortunately. You have to prove you weren't careless, you often have to wait for weeks to get the money back, etc. 
Multisignature escrow allows for the third party to reverse the transaction if they agree the seller didn't follow the agreement. It can be fully transparently integrated in the wallet clients. The wallet would silently create a multisignature P2SH using an address from the seller, themselves and from the escrow. The seller and escrow agent would be notified simultaneously and accept our right away. This would have the same legal and practical effect as making a CC payment, with the same user experience as using chip and PIN payment or similar methods.

Proof-of-Stake has the issue that you at no extra cost can back every version of the transaction history that has been published. That means that are actually are no real guarantee that you've got proper consensus.
We really do need an algorithm where *some* kind of resource, no matter what type, has to be provably spent on vouching for *one* specific transaction history, which can't be respent on vouching for other versions of the history.
And it needs to be able to work such that if the majority of these resources are spent honestly, the whole system is secure, and that honesty is more profitable than malice.
Proof-of-work happens to be perfect for this. That's why Bitcoin uses it.
Maybe we could move to something like zero-knowledge proofs of useful computations, but then we still have the major problem of figuring out what should be computed and how valuable those computations are, not to mention that zero-knowledge proofs still adds so much computational overhead that it really isn't cost-effective at all in the first place.

Multiple keypairs required to sign, and each private key is split up in several pieces. 
To sign a transaction, you have you gather all the pieces and enter the strings from a different set of pieces on each computer. You could have different people each manage one set of pieces for one of the private keys. 
If one computer is infected by malware, it can't manipulate the transaction anyway because the uninfected ones will not signed the manipulated transaction.

The problem is that we need to do a bit more research on visual perception and on what it takes to tell two representations apart, how to make them rememberable, how to make sure enough entropy is represented, avoid visual collisions, etc... 
There could be animated representations (look up the screensaver Electric Sheep). And audio representations. And tactile (braille).

Not yet, but I have a very short draft. Not yet worth publishing. Will continue writing on it.
I have extended the idea with transaction bundles that each merchant chain and transaction processor can create with an accompanying Zero-knowledge proof. And this would be combined with the ability to merge bundles and chain together Zero-knowledge proofs to show that the merged bundle is fully valid, so international transaction processors can take turns on creating the bundle to serve to miners. Miners would then take the Merkle tree hashes from these bundles and the Zero-knowledge proof, include that in the block and mine on it. The transaction processors and other such entities would each have a database of the transactions. And IBLT also limits the bandwidth requirements when comparing all these bundles and sending transaction data back and forth.
Edit: what special kind of jackass downvoted this...?

It needs to have the correct length and you have to put a 4 byte checksum at the end. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 18:22:42
Yes and no. 
You can see who runs Bitcoin nodes and isolate them and show them your own chain, but your chain must be fully valid, so you have to mine at a high rate. If you only have a fraction of the hashing power of the network, your chain will be far shorter. 
The client has built in checkpoints, from which the client calculates the minimum required difficulty for the following set of blocks. 
Your chain will still have less total mining power behind it even if you get it to become as long (due to difficulty being lowered in your chain to be able to make it longer).

Honest Bitcoin nodes only relay valid and non-conflicting transactions. Honest miners only creates blocks that include valid and non-conflicting transactions. 
Combined that means that the first valid transaction that spend any given previous transaction output is generally the one that ends up in the blockchain, any second transaction that spend the same output gets ignored by everybody who have seen the first one.

Q is original public key, Q' is the new one. 
Using your private key and another person's public key, you can generate a shared secret. S is derived from that. The shared secret are used to modify the public key in a particular way, and ECC allows for modifying the private key on a corresponding way to generate a valid keypair. That's how the receiver are able to spend from the new address.

Security wise it will be horrifying. Nobody will make more than a brief glance at the name shown on their phone, so if it is open for all merchants then there will be mass exploits of the ambiguity and endless payment MITMs. 
If it won't be open for all merchants, it will yet again be entirely uninteresting (unless you ONLY buy everything in hipster malls). 
At least those holes typically aren't unfixable architectural holes. BLE unanchored is horrifyingly bad. NFC or Qr codes or IrDA or stuff like that would be good anchors.

    Your post advocates a
    
    ( ) technical ( ) legislative (x) market-based ( ) vigilante
    
    approach to fighting spam. Your idea will not work. Here is why it won't work.
    (One or more of the following may apply to your particular idea, and it may
    have other flaws which used to vary from state to state before a bad federal
    law was passed.)
    
    ( ) Spammers can easily use it to harvest email addresses
    (x) Mailing lists and other legitimate email uses would be affected
    ( ) No one will be able to find the guy or collect the money
    ( ) It is defenseless against brute force attacks
    (x) It will stop spam for two weeks and then we'll be stuck with it
    (x) Users of email will not put up with it
    ( ) Microsoft will not put up with it
    ( ) The police will not put up with it
    ( ) Requires too much cooperation from spammers
    (x) Requires immediate total cooperation from everybody at once
    (x) Many email users cannot afford to lose business or alienate potential employers
    ( ) Spammers don't care about invalid addresses in their lists
    ( ) Anyone could anonymously destroy anyone else's career or business
    
    Specifically, your plan fails to account for
    
    ( ) Laws expressly prohibiting it
    ( ) Lack of centrally controlling authority for email
    ( ) Open relays in foreign countries
    ( ) Ease of searching tiny alphanumeric address space of all email addresses
    (x) Asshats
    ( ) Jurisdictional problems
    (x) Unpopularity of weird new taxes
    (x) Public reluctance to accept weird new forms of money
    ( ) Huge existing software investment in SMTP
    ( ) Susceptibility of protocols other than SMTP to attack
    (x) Willingness of users to install OS patches received by email
    (x) Armies of worm riddled broadband-connected Windows boxes
    ( ) Eternal arms race involved in all filtering approaches
    (x) Extreme profitability of spam
    (x) Joe jobs and/or identity theft
    ( ) Technically illiterate politicians
    (x) Extreme stupidity on the part of people who do business with spammers
    ( ) Dishonesty on the part of spammers themselves
    ( ) Bandwidth costs that are unaffected by client filtering
    (x) Outlook
    
    and the following philosophical objections may also apply:
    
    ( ) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever been shown practical
    ( ) Any scheme based on opt-out is unacceptable
    ( ) SMTP headers should not be the subject of legislation
    ( ) Blacklists suck
    ( ) Whitelists suck
    ( ) We should be able to talk about Viagra without being censored
    ( ) Countermeasures should not involve wire fraud or credit card fraud
    ( ) Countermeasures should not involve sabotage of public networks
    ( ) Countermeasures must work if phased in gradually
    (x) Sending email should be free
    ( ) Why should we have to trust you and your servers?
    ( ) Incompatiblity with open source or open source licenses
    (x) Feel-good measures do nothing to solve the problem
    ( ) Temporary/one-time email addresses are cumbersome
    ( ) I don't want the government reading my email
    ( ) Killing them that way is not slow and painful enough
    
    Furthermore, this is what I think about you:
    
    (x) Sorry dude, but I don't think it would work.
    ( ) This is a stupid idea, and you're a stupid person for suggesting it.
    ( ) Nice try, assh0le! I'm going to find out where you live and burn your house down!

They are about the same, there's just some difference in variance.

A transaction's recommended fee depends on it's size in kilobytes. That size depends among other on how many inputs you claim (how many payments you've received that you now use to spend).
If you don't use the whole sum, your client will prioritize using the set of inputs that will give the lowest recommend fee, not all of them (even if all payments were to the same address, they're still separate). Think of each incoming payment as one check or one lump of gold - you only include as many as needed no matter where they came from or to where, and the recipient will receive it as one piece (as if the gold got molten together when spent together, or the checks were cashed in together).

Ponzis almost always provide positive ROI for *some* people, which typically is a tiny minority. This is done to fool these people into advocating the ponzi and promising it is great, based on their own experience. 
The problem is that it by definition can't be profitable for everybody. On average it is a loss, simple as that. 
And then there's the long con. Hype up the scam, give you a small profit, and when you're controlled by your emotions believing it is great they convince you to invest much more than you otherwise would have done from the start - and then they run with your money.

One option is to let miners with the upgrade add a flag in their blocks that shows they support it, and after block number X in the future and over Y% of the last Z blocks with that flag, you know it has a majority support from the miners who already have it implemented, so then the new code is activated.

So you start mining BEFORE you're connected to the network so that you can get access to the file?
Anybody with access can just share their private keys, or share the file directly.
Besides, the blockchain model is inefficient for file distribution. Paying for access to a torrent file is functionally equivalent but more scalable. Just let the custom torrent nodes ask for a reference to a transaction to the author and prove that they own the private key by signing a challenge. Then they get the torrent.

It is the worst imaginable solution, but it also happens to be the only one that works.

Every single engineer would be horrified by the idea and start looking foe options instantly, but will accept it only after realizing it is the only option that works. This is the total opposite to something like the clever idea of braking electric vehicles by using the motor as a generator to suck momentum out of the car to recharge the batteries. 
It breaks so many assumptions, is orthogonal to the current standard practices and the common goals in mind for creating new systems and protocols, and is generally ugly to anybody looking for an elegant solution.

I was discussing that as an starting point, not long term situation. As I already said, that doesn't last. The goal was to explain why it doesn't last. 
Now, how do the pools flock together? If you'd overtake the biggest selfish mining pool by several percent even combined, don't you want to shed individual miners to reduce the profit sharing? You'll have political infighting. Ephemeral alliances, i.e. groups of small pools temporarily mining as one. Infiltration, attacks, sabotage, stealing members as far as you can. Anything to get slightly bigger than the currently biggest pool. But you don't want to cooperate with ideological opponents, unless a bigger opponent is currently winning.  And so on. 
It doesn't remain stable. Even after they approach 3x33%, it isn't stable. If one can sustain the majority for long enough, the other pools would have to do a full 51% attack (51% of the total, not just pairwise) and block the other pool - or switch to honest mining!

Re: archiving;
One could manually create new accounts for each year and archive the old ones and move over the funds manually every new year, but maybe you could make that a bit more automatic?
Like setting a template/script for an accounts series and a quick action so that you can create a new one with a correct name, moving the funds and archiving the old one in one go? Like "Trading 2014" and "XYZ sales 2014Q3", where "Trading 2015" and "XYZ sales 2014Q4" is created, funds moved and the old ones archived, in one action.
Edit: and +1 to idea of a function to sweep archived accounts, looking through all addresses for unclaimed UTXO's, listing them per account (maybe not listed by default of they're many) to be swept with a click. Note that some be accounts may be purposely left "idle" and shouldn't be swept with the rest, thus the option to select what to sweep. Maybe there should be a freeze option like currently Electrum has per-address? Also, some options for how deep to look in what accounts should be available.

You're confusing structural hierarchy and timing/invested resources. Those who got in early may have paid less, but that's just like with stocks. Nobody has more power or control than anybody else because of when they got it or through who.


Having an entry assigned to your public key in the Bitcoin protocol's blockchain is a matematically enforced means of controlling unique scarce tokens. While it don't come with shares in something physical, it's not like there's much of a difference in owning stocks in companies that don't ever pay out dividends to shareholders, in particular non-voting ones! The price of stocks are rarely representative of the actual value of the company either (those assets and future cash flow you mentioned). And your stocks can literally vanish if the company goes bankrupt. While the value of bitcoins might tank, they're not going to vanish.


Shitty how? And why are you so obsessed with it having an unstable price when it's still just 5 years old and at most a few million users worldwide? Do you think gold had a stable price when it was new? How many new currencies were stable from the start? I'm actually willing to wait several decades. What's extremely limited about it when it can do MORE? Are you aware that the USD is slowly losing it's reserve currency status? Many countries are looking at moving to trading for example oil denominated in other countries, and reducing their holdings in USD. Not to mention that the total money supply in USD have gone up by about 5x since 2008 (yay inflation). Just because the organizations behind it are large, that's no guarantee it's going to survive forever.
You don't have to believe the developers behind Bitcoin know what they're doing, it will survive anyway. The whole point is that it doesn't need any central entity to back it in the first place. If people want it, it will survive. And there are tons of smart people who wants it to survive.


Nobody's saying that scarcity equals value. But it *enables* value. And it's the unique features if it that together with scarcity gives it value, because the properties makes people want it and the scarcity means there's only a certain amount of units that each person can acquire, so you end up with supply / demand = value (and with demand I mean how much people are willing to pay in total).


Mostly not hypotetical. It's more a question of if it will be made easy to use and people will prefer to use it. I think it will happen. And nitpick, it's not encrypted. Bitcoin only uses hashes and digital signatures, no encryption. Also, those features themselves IS what will make it valuable, as people won't be able to use them without acquiring some of the tokens.


Utility as in what it can be used for today? That's something that can change, and remember that Bitcoin is global. Security, how? Maybe if you pay up to outsource the risk to somebody with a big vault. Less risky *today*, but once again I'm willing to wait a few decades. If you come back in 40 years, will you say the same thing?


Of the old gold, most of it is in vaults as well. And didn't you say that the speculative value of Bitcoin needs to be shedded? But those things *are* speculative and entirely subjective. Those valuations will INHERENTLY always fluctuate. It is less implausible than you might think for gold to fall out of fashion. 


Having gold sitting in a vault or safe no matter if it's in the form of jewelry or raw bricks is just two sides of the same coin. It's not in practical use, nobody's looking at it, all you're relying on is it's scarcity and the speculation that the valuation of it will remain. If you look at how the majority of it is used, it essentially all comes down to value relying on it's scarcity. And the reason it was chosen in the first place over the alternatives is mostly because of the properties listed in here (hint - it's the easiest to handle and is scarcer than most options):
Bitcoins is going to be even easier to handle than that, and with gold certificates being overissued, it's scarcity already has far better guarantees.
For what reason do you consider them financially illiterate? And far from all of them are doomsday types. Also, that argument just confirms what I've said about it's financial use, and yet you agree on it's value. Which for some reason you're saying can't apply to Bitcoin, for reasons unknown.


People have never overvalued anything or misjudged risks?


Again, I'm willing to wait. I'm certain it has value, and it's still just in it's early stages. We don't even have simple hardware wallets out yet, and it's STILL going to be considered the early days when the really cheap ones will start to get common (minimum 5 years away, probably 10 years).

P2Pool is decentralized, and can't be abused by any pool operator for doublespending, 51% attacks or similar. For that particular pool, 51% attacks aren't an issue. 
Avoid Ghash, because they don't seem to care all that much about the survival of Bitcoin, they were very close to 50% of the mining power recently which automatically makes people anxious due to the increased risk of a successful 51% attack by them. They are focused too much on short term benefit.

A layer that makes others insecure is one that has assumptions that conflicts with other ones. 
For example, one can be secure if you know A but not B, another is secure if you know B but not A, and both provide that other data, so you use data from one to unlock the other and vice versa. See attacks like "pass-the-hash" where you simply hand on data from one system to another to unlock it.

With the common key exchange methods like ~~ECDSA~~ ECDHE (mostly the same math as ECDSA), you can't influence what the session key will be. The value depends on the secret value both sides generated.

Bitcoin uses prefixes in the addresses for a reason. We could easily decide that the ones that start with 4 is quantum proof NTRU or McEliece keys.
Also, see Fawkes signatures. You publish a hash of the transaction before publishing it, so you don't reveal the public key but still commit to the particular transaction. Then a quantum computer still can't doublespend your coins, because their transaction wouldn't match that hash.

In both cases I made an active choice and nobody can force me to accept anything else. 
Switch escrow, absolutely. Because I do not need to use the one the payment processor provides anymore, so there's actual fair competition. I can pick one with a good reputation. And I still have the choice of going to the courts if the escrow deny my claim. 
His decision to what? Travel? Yes. Not register or in advance? Yes. Have his money frozen? No. You know that they could still freeze your money even for things outside your control? Gift cards are not under your control despite what you claimed. No external entity can freeze your Bitcoins. Do you think that guy made a bad judgment to use a gift card bought before he traveled instead of his normal card without sending in paperwork? Yes or no? How was he "insulated" when Visa caused him the maximum harm possible (total loss of the remaining funds)? He did indeed follow up, but when he was told to go to court which would lose him MORE money, he chose to not do it. Talk about victim blaming! 
Blockchain.info (the website) has been unstable for almost a year now IIRC, and I never trusted them much from the start. Electrum on PC and Schildbach's Bitcoin Wallet and Mycelium are my favorites. None of them have those problems. And Greenaddress.it is promising, it is a multisig wallet which can offer the same fraud detection and prevention that banks use - WHICH IS OPTIONAL, so you can choose for yourself if you want it or not. 
That's the whole point here. Everything is optional! I'm never forced to accept risks I don't want!

A lot of the use cases derives *directly* from that the tokens of value lives directly on the blockchain, and is only possible (in a decentralized manner) because of that. Such as the previously mentioned smart property, which for example in the case of devices for sale by an electronics retailer will become usable by the customer the moment the complete transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, not before or after (a strong deterrence against theft).

If you'd do it differently and not choose the steps directly but to choose a state from the unique ones in a way that have an even probability distribution (using all this complicated math that was used to find out how many states there are) and then determining the steps from start to there, then it essentially is like XOR.

You forgot the part about "malicious actors", because no other BGP protocol can handle anything more than a very tiny fraction of dissenting nodes (at most 1/3, when they AREN'T malicious). The blockchain approach works even for nodes that have never interacted before without any trust requirement. Also, recovery from network splits (either because network connectivity or malice) is automatic, no matter how much the forks have diverged. No other protocol can get anywhere near that.
Also, again, it's a probabilistic solution - it may not work for 100% of cases, but most people will settle for 99.99999999%. It's good enough to render the proof of impossibility into academic trivia.

So you want to be able to be careless without getting hurt? You can still use escrow and pay for insurance, by the way. But not everybody needs it. 
Visa? You forgot when they blocked all donations to Wikileaks? Good luck with that. 
If you get lots of fraudulent chargebacks, the only possible change to your business model is to end it = shut down. Amazon and many other companies like that can absorb the cost because the business is still profitable enough. Services like VPNs don't ship any physical goods and can shut down that account in seconds, so their losses from chargebacks is close to zero because they can also easily charge in advance. But when you ship physical goods and Visa says the customer claims you didn't ship the goods, so you don't get the money? You're screwed. A lot of niche companies have this problem, including those selling adult items, and many other fields as well. 
With the option for a multisignature escrow service both sides can agree on, *neither side* gets unfair treatment. Because everything is optional, and if you don't like the terms of the sale you don't accept them. Neither the buyer or the seller would accept an escrow that is as biased as Visa and Mastercard and PayPal is, in either direction, when there is real choice. One that always favor the merchant would become a major red flag to consumers, and one that always side with the customers would get rejected by the merchants.

He is likely talking about the company named RSA implementing Dual EC DBRG as the default random number generator for their software services for their clients.
That RNG is most certainly backdoored. A proof of concept that works exist of using that algorithm with custom constants you've generated where knowing a few outputs reveals the internal state and this all current and future outputs. It is like using a public key of somebody else to encrypt your entropy to get random numbers. If the secret numbers used to generate the constants was kept by NSA or whoever else made them up, then they are definitely capable of deriving all RNG outputs.

Rating as in giving a score, maybe 1-10.
If all you have is colored coins and an address per choice, then you need to set up tons of addresses to achieve the same thing.
Vote correlation when the blockchain is public is possible. For example, you can uniquely identify an astonishing number of people based on something simple as their top 10 Netflix favorites. While most votes will look very similar, advanced data mining can identify likely votes from a larger number of people based public data such as from Facebook. And then you're essentially playing sudoku to match up most of the rest. Then you can see that the person you knew voted for A, B &amp; C also voted for X.
If you give people multiple votes to distribute among their choices, how go you simultaneously maintain anonymity and prevent doublevoting (or how do you want it to work?).

Not even smartcard style hardware? 
There are ways to "blind" the vote such that the terminal doesn't know what the voter choose if he can use his smartcard for input (only needs a few buttons on it). The choices don't necessarily have to be displayed on a screen, they could be displayed on paper that the voter can get from just about anywhere. 
A voter that do not find his nonce would hopefully also keep the hash of the encrypted vote, and can then prove it was submitted by showing it validates against the pre-count Merkle tree hash but is missing from the result. 
Enough missing votes can lead to starting over with the vote. It would be fine with having a vote per region to reduce how much you'd have to redo (like one per state in USA).

Slasher is bad because anybody who mined in a block that didn't get into the chain lost that stake, because trying to use it to mine will get him punished. 
Intentionally isolating individual miners would be easy if you can control unwise local network (arp spoofing from another device on their LAN, malicious router, ISP, etc...). Then you can make them think they mined on the real chain with minimal effort, burning their stake. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:14:39
The only other way which is even possible which would be "cheap" is hacking mining pools - if the majority of miner hardware doesn't attempt to detect malicious behavior by the pool and then switch pool. Hacking large amounts of individual miners is both time consuming = man-power expensive and ineffective against miners which watch their mining hardware's behavior (malicious behavior can't be hidden from the owner), and fighting thousands of individual mining hardware owners at once isn't exactly trivial. You'd have to attempt to plant backdoors in the firmware on all of the hardware to have even small chance.

We need some type of globally unique algorithmic proof of spending a verifiable amount (to some reasonable approximation) of a scarce resource. (So we can select the chain backed by the largest amount of resources which in turn most likely is backed by the largest amount of cooperative miners.)
What type of resource doesn't matter if the above criteria is fulfilled.
So far only proof-of-work solves the problem. PoS fails at the globally unique part (respendable in forks). Trying to fight it with complex chain selection methods ends up giving you a really crappy version of scrypt mining.

1: yes, some people have have been hit by this before, deleting the new wallet the change ended up on because they thought it all was in the paper wallet.

Notaries would have public keys you can identify, or use "tags" like with OP_RETURN to let you identify transactions signed by them. 
Potentially they can chose to only reveal the status of a transaction to the recipients (by asking for a signed request with the receiving keys). 
But I don't think it's a big issue to let the transaction type be known (that it is a notarized transaction). 
Greenaddress.it implements a version of this, you can check how they do it. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 22:16:34

Look at things like the multisignature service Greenaddress.it, they can't steal your coins because they would need a key only you have. Each of you have one keypair, and both are required. At the same time they enable two-factor authentication (SMS, email, OTP and more as options) to authorize transactions, making it more secure for most people than local wallets. 
They even implemented nlocktime so that if their site goes down, then after a given amount of time your coins are automatically unlocked anyway so you can spend it without needing their second signature, and the unlock time for the remaining coins is extended every time you use their service. (originally requested by me and some others)

Fawkes signatures are space efficient, but OTOH it is time inefficient - it is a commitment scheme relying on secure timestamps, which the blockchain itself provides.

Most miners won't sell access to their hardware like that, they would put their own investment at risk. Their Bitcoins and mining hardware would become worthless if the price tanked. Acquiring the hardware won't be all that easy or quick. You'll have to pay full price for manufacturing the hardware. And SHA256 is one of those things which are massively boosted in speed on custom circuits vs general purpose hardware. 
Those who want extra assurance can use multisignature notaries like Greenaddress.it and bitgo, which provides security for the duration of an attack (after the attack and inclusion of the transactions in the blockchain, the security goes back to relying on the mining process). 
That socially based subjective thingy is a variant of Web of Trust. Simple as that. You need to trust the people making the checkpoints, and I can assure you there will be thousands of conflicting chains/checkpoints to choose between.

Block erupter is a specific model, like avalons and KnC Jupiter. ASIC = application specific integrated circuit. And ASIC miner is usually referencing Bitcoin mining hardware optimized for Bitcoin's SHA256 proof-of-work based mining algorithm. 
FPGA = field programmable gate array. They are reprogrammable, like a special type of CPU you can configure to do one specific thing efficiently, but you can only optimize it for a few algorithms at once, reprogramming isn't instant. Ordinary CPUs (central processing units) can switch instantly between practically any type of algorithm, which is why they dominate most things.

Maybe if the coinbase simply was a hash of the data + a compact zero-knowledge proof of that the P2Pool protocol was followed (verifable by any P2Pool node) and that the miners spending their coins from it included their own corresponding zero-knowledge proofs of having mined it, then it should be possible.

Where are you trading Bitcoins? I've got two exchanges here that I can transfer to for free, that have below 1% in exchange fees.
Many of the foreign ones still only have a small fee for bank transfers and a few percent for exchange, plus at most 1% *total* for Bitpay or Coinbase (with fixed fee and 0% per transaction as an option for Bitpay). For most people that doesn't stack up to 7%.

Quantum networking won't practically ever be used outside labs or private networks. For as long as there exists strong classical encryption algorithms, they'll remain the go-to choice because everything based on quantum mechanics have an absurd level of overhead.
256 bit encryption will survive, with hashes we could jump to 512 bit ones in the worst case scenario (birthday paradox collision resistance), and we have multiple public key crypto algorithms that is quantum resistant.

Sure, everything that goes into making the keys contributes entropy. But the parts that are easy to guess and those that can be derived by an outsider looking at the available details leaks entropy, so you should really only consider the unpredictable entropy when estimating strength. People have a tendency to overestimate entropy. 
If your entire method is "short algorithm X", then anybody guessing the same algorithm (not all that hard one you start testing algorithms) are likely to encounter it.

Apple apparently agrees that NFC is the simplest method that is secure enough for payments. 
Although the combo fingerprint reader plus mobile payments... If the average user has about $100 or so available for spending, suddenly iPhones will become prime targets, because you only need less than 1h work to copy most fingerprints reliably. You don't even need to steal it, just temporarily hold it for long enough to make some payments. Watch a bunch of people in a coffee shop or train station for some days to try to find good copies of their prints, make copies, snatch their phones and then pay. Potentially you'll hand back the phones, likely silently (reverse pocket picking), since that way you delay detection too. This can take under 2 minutes to perform! 
A password you're protecting when entering it is good enough.

And you think it somehow never can be replaced with alloys that are better at the specific task at hand? How often is gold and only gold exactly the right solution with exactly all the right properties? 
It still somehow remains cheaper than the old systems. Their legacy systems has tons of overhead they can't just ditch. And most of the bells and whistles of Bitcoin doesn't automatically make it perform worse in any way. 
If every single task you would need gold for would have a better alternative show up, why would anybody ever want gold again? It's not like anybody is hanging on to ancient types of concrete or the early plastics. They're phased out! 
What kind of economics are ever completely detached from the physical world it is supposed to explain and describe and help to organize? 
Do you really think that the technical properties have no impact on the economics? 
Because if you do, then your arguments just simply aren't automatically applicable to the real world. The world just doesn't care about your economic models, it will do whatever it wish, and any discrepancies between what the world does and what the model says is caused by flaws in the model.

Because OP used the cash equivalent. 
You know you have another choice, right? Buy only at places using arbitrators you trust, unless you already trust the merchant. Kind of like how you don't sign up for new CC:s at random when shopping online. You look for places using a payment processor you trust, usually PayPal, Visa or Mastercard. That's like 3 common choices. Don't like those? Sorry, no options. 
Yes I do. With how little job an arbitrator has to do compared to cc companies and how little overhead they have, they don't have to charge for every single transaction, and the fee per filed complaint can be low. 
Greenaddress.it and bitgo is able to provide multisignature notary services for free *because it is insanely cheap to run*. A few dozen computers can handle many millions of transactions a day, and they require almost no maintenance. Companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft wouldn't even notice the load in their networks counted in a hundredth of a percent of their total. 
You need to start reading up about the horror stories that happen frequently with banks. Easy to prove? Oh really, how do you do that? If it was that easy, nobody would ever be fighting their banks for months. And again, I don't see anybody negotiating themselves into lower CC fees. Besides, how do you negotiate fees even you're poor? The banks won't even care. 
So how different are their services, exactly? No point in switching if everybody is the same. And traditionally *very* few here in Sweden switch banks, we've even had people from our financial institutes complaining about that fact on the news. Not to mention there's STILL very limited choices for payment processors. Remember when Visa and Mastercard blocked Wikileaks? All the times PayPal has frozen money for fundraisers and charity and crowd funding? When all your options are just as bad, there's nothing to change. 
Nothing prevents you from making a J2ME Bitcoin client for those Nokia phones.

Zerocoin is based on having a common RSA based accumulator (updated by the miners to include all deposits) that all anonymizing deposits are registered to, and Zero-knowledge proofs on withdrawals being valid and not doublespent (references the deposit via the accumulator in a non-reusable way).
Zerocash encrypts the entire transactions so that only the sender and receiver can read the plain transaction data and has a Zero-knowledge proof of the entire transaction being valid. I think it also uses an accumulator. It uses smaller Zero-knowledge proofs and has several parts of the design updated.

For example, let's say the attacker started at block 3 to create his own chain where he sends the coins to himself, then he sends a regular payment to the regular network that ends up in block 4. Then by releasing his own chain when block 6 is released and he's at e, the network sees that his chain is longer and selects it, so the payment in 4 is reversed and he keeps his coins. He can also select what ends up in his blocks.

I can say no wallets generates the change address from the paper wallet key. 
Multibit sends the change to the imported address. Bitcoin-Qt sends it to a random new address. Electrum sends change coming from imported addresses back to the imported address, but sends change coming from the deterministic addresses to a new deterministic address. 
Blockchain.info and most other online wallets lets you choose between simply importing the addresses (after which it would be treated like one of the above cases) or sweeping (moving all coins from it to another address, then not keeping the key).

There is no ASIC proof. Either you optimize hard for using everything in one single CPU, or you will be able to design an ASIC-style optimized CPU that does only exactly what that algorithm uses with all other overhead removed.
Optimizing hard for one CPU model will screw you over hard when that model isn't sold anymore, and countering that by having multiple algorithms for 100 different models will be a waste of time. And miners will still be forced to buy custom hardware.

I don't trust Apple's security. They give no reason for me to expect their stuff to hold up to attack. 
Crap like advertising iMessage as secure because it uses "end-to-end encryption" and not readable to them when both ends are controlled by Apple, key distribution is controlled by Apple and neither user can verify the connection ACTUALLY being secure without both being jailbroken and comparing keypairs out-of-band, which only makes me suspicious. And then there's the fact that icloud backups of imessage is unencrypted (that's why they can be restored to new devices after disconnecting all previous devices from your account and doing a, password reset, after which there exists nothing secure enough to be used as an encryption key which Apple don't have access to).

And what would be a reasonable "base" for it? 
Gold isn't much better - if it falls, you're "just" losing 95% of your money? 
Why can't the unique features it provides be enough to establish demand, such as m-of-n transactions and smart contracts? Why wouldn't being *better transactions* work? 
People want to be able to use their money effectively and securely. If Bitcoin does that better, then there's your economics. There's a demand, and Bitcoin fulfills it. 
Also, note that this is a protocol. HTTP never got replaced, things like SPDY never had a chance. Instead HTTP 2.0 is now under development, including the best new features of the new competing protocols.

You only need a single hash and the Merkle root to see if the hash is part of it. 
With a hash list that itself is hashed, you need all the hashes. 
So with how it works now, you only need the header of the block and the transaction of choice to confirm its part of the blockchain.

From what I've read those are connected. Who processes transactions, then? AFAICT the next miner is sent new transactions directly. 
Not entirely the same there. You don't have to isolate everybody, mostly only propagate your favored chains faster (which is easier if you also mess with the propagation of the rest). 
I don't assume there are no possible function f, but rather that it will be unreliable in a global network. It only have the same result of everybody see the same thing. Ideally all views of the network would agree such that nobody sorts any pair of chains differently than the rest sorts that pair (so essentially an objective scoring and sorting algorithm), or else you get infinite block reorganizations.

Uhm, yes, you can see which chain you were given to work on and reject that work. You're not forced to obey the request of the pool. That's essentially pool jumping. You're looking at what blocks is being given to work on from multiple sources. 
How could this make the blockchain stop advancing? You're assuming nobody will ever get a longer chain. That's so absurdly statistically unlikely that the possibility can be rejected. Like seriously, how would that happen? You're assuming there will always be an equally long secret chain getting released as soon as somebody thinks they have the longest chain and publishes it, you're assuming no chain will be chosen by the majority to work on, and much much more. Your assumptions are too improbable.

So Zerocoin just got killed off, essentially? Because this seems to be both more computationally efficient and cryptographically secure, is free from manual steps, has no delays, etc... 
But I'm wondering, if I send a payment to a stealth address, I can see those coins being spent, right? What if online wallets got hacked, and people get deanonymized that way, since they might have been expecting that they wouldn't need any other steps? 
Although you could have two layers of stealth wallets, where you send coins to a second wallet of your own (would it always generate identical addresses for the same pairs?). Then there's still a manual step (unless your wallet automates it), but then you are at least safe from that kind of attacks or key leaks. 
Edit: I don't think simply having two layers of stealth address helps. But you could forward coins from your stealth addresses to separate addresses from a BIP32 seed (you could even have the BIP32 seed and the stealth address seed be generated from the same secret). Although that don't really add all that much obfuscation in where the coins went either... People who send to you shouldn't be able to see if you spend that to a public address. 
I guess it wouldn't be a problem if everybody used stealth addresses + coinjoin, and switched once in a while just to reduce the risk of malware = key material leaks and deanonymization. 
Although without widespread use of coinjoin, somebody who'd compromise many wallets at once (online wallet services, Bitpay, etc) could still spot people who combined payments received from different people in payments to others. They could find patterns in how people spend.

You don't seem to understand my points. You don't need to be your own bank, you can still use Bitcoin's features. You can have company board members in an international company trivially link their accounts in the way Bitpay's Copay does it, still using your bank. You won't notice the difference from a regular shared account in which all account holders need to approve the transactions, and yet you just massively boosted your security. And normally that can ONLY be done within one bank or between tightly cooperating banks, but now the banks no longer need to know each other. 
There's so much more than that, and the only thing you'll notice is that you suddenly have far more options than you used to.

Note that a nonce search on quantum computers would require enough qubits to hold the entire block in memory plus overhead, as it needs to be able to compute the Merkle tree hash in the header and to be able to shuffle the order of transactions as part of the mining (the nonce only has 32 bits of entropy, you need a hundred or so). Then it can iterate through nonces and compute SHA256 looking for a valid block. 
My point is basically this: setup time is non-zero and you only have 10 minutes until you must reset. Also, the complexity makes it harder as far more qubits need to be kept coherent, and it might very well slow down output reads too, slowing the speed of the quantum computer (every "quantum operation" is one round of running it and reading the results).

Note that all transactions are atomic. They either happen in full, or they don't happen at all.
This in combination with the checksums and digital signatures ensures that your node can't be tricked into accepting a blockchain that has any faults or modifications. There can't be a "stuck" transaction where the money was deducted but not a available to the recipient. (you can however get the transaction details wrong when creating it so it becomes unspendable by screwing up the script, but it will still be a fully valid atomic transaction.)

&amp;gt; The Clearing House (TCH) developed the Secure Token Exchange (STE) tokenization specification in 2012, which was called Secure Cloud at that time. TCH is said to have put a lot of effort to come up with this standard: It evaluated differences between the STE and EMVCo specs and identified key disparities in token formatting, lifecycle management, PAN ownership and the use of static versus dynamic tokens. TCH defined and developed a set of messages to support token formatting, which EMVCo does not include. TCH also has a lifecycle management process to handle a stolen payment card or mobile phone, including identification of messages that need to be exchanged to cancel the tokens and ensure the customer experience is not negatively impacted.
There's the original source. That's what developed into the current EMV tokenization. Apple didn't invent anything, yet again. They just implemented it. Apple couldn't really have made any big contributions to the tech in the first place as it is the banks and credit card companies which needs to be the ones making it work on their backends in the first place, at most they could have been contributing meaningfully to how the clients (phones) talk to the servers and terminals.
And yet again, the main difference between that and what Google already was doing is part of the technical implementation and the standardization.

No shilling going on. 
So we have 10 forks. Maybe 2 or 3 of those will be equally long at worst. Nobody will have a chance at winning over these longest forks. 
So now everybody mines in private again. Now chances are they won't be equal distributed across the forks. So chances are even smaller they'll have equally long forks again when somebody publish their chain. 
So 1 week passed and nobody published their chain. Miner X needs to pay his electricity bill. He leaks the chain. Due to the mechanics above, one chain will win. 
All miners eventually want to cash out their profit. Eventually somebody MUST leak the chain. 
This situation isn't sustainable because everybody is hurt by keeping it up. Unless you're alone in doing it, you'll fail eventually. Mining will be too unprofitable to continue. In the long run you'll lose money because of it.
The worst long term sustainable variant is having all miners *occasionally* run this tactic and then cut it off a short while later.

People can make demands and be upset, but few can afford to ditch their existing alternative for something that isn't yet better. Unless it was already better on launch for everybody, it won't get all that many users, and then it won't pay back. 
If those "2-3 options" collude? What's the point of having options then?

I2P doesn't to do anything fancy with latency for torrents either, and there's no QoS going on. The existence of that constant flow of data packets makes it easier to hide other traffic, that's all. 
I'm pretty sure my I2P node is aware of far more than 40 nodes, and that it is capable of asking every known node about new nodes. At most you'd have a risk for new nodes trying to bootstrap, or a risk of DoS. 
I2P is relevant when you're talking about services online where you're trying to hide your location and traffic patterns. So basically everything but "cleanternet" browsing. 
Wasn't that bug Tails specific? Configuration error, IIRC, made it possible. Haven't looked close at the details. If you've heard otherwise, link please. Anyway, I'm using NoScript and password protection on the console. As everybody should, it is basic opsec, should be the first browser extension you install. 
Also, I2P is dealing with that too. Academic research on I2P is picking up slowly, Tor has been getting more attention the entire last decade, but the I2P developers haven't been ignoring that. They look at the Tor research too. If you look at their documentation and planning, they aren't exactly ignoring those things. If I2P had the same total brainpower behind it, I believe it would significantly outperform the competition simply because I believe the architecture is better.

Your assumptions on incentives is broken. 
Far from all small miners will merge into selfish mining pools. If/when all pools are selfish mining, the only options of the smaller pools is to merge or steal miners from the others or convince the others to stop selfish mining together with them (or else you go bankrupt). The largest pool have no incentive to take in new miners while they're still the biggest (profit dilution), as no chain longer than theirs is likely to appear. And of course nobody wants to switch to mining on any chain not longer than their own. This is why it doesn't matter how large your pool is if you're not the biggest selfish mining pool, almost nobody else will work on your chain. If your chain can't get as much mining power behind it as the biggest pool has, you're screwed. 
The only reason the biggest pool would mine on other chains is if one other pool would luck out and match their chain length, making most of the mining power in the other pools work on that chain once published (as their own chains were shorter), and this will be very rare. If the social / market dynamics prevent the smaller pools from merging or taking enough miners to become biggest, they'll *only* lose unless they convince the others to stop selfish mining. Hardware developments will statistically prevent the largest pool from remaining the largest pool (as they won't always be first with new more efficient miners, these developments are quite random too). If you run unprofitably for too long, you have to shut down, as I said above. So all pools notably smaller than the biggest selfish mining pool will eventually go bankrupt.
If this leaves the biggest pool as a full 51% pool (51% of all power, not just 51% as compared one-by-one with each of the other pools) the market value of the coins WILL drop. So they go bankrupt too. Chances are it also will drop if there's suspicion that the majority of mining power uses selfish mining.
So the biggest pools will then be forced *by the market forces* to not be pure selfish mining pools. Only a small part can be selfish mining at any given time to not get punished by the market forces. 
So essentially in the long term everybody loses. Like I said before, you can only ever make a profit in the short term by doing this temporarily once in a while.

Not all pools use PPLNS or equivalents. Individual miners can also have small parts of their mining power at secondary pools and switch primary pools when that's more profitable.

With that logic I assume you never ever use cash, because you think the companies you deal with will break the deal. You probably never use cash with family and friends either. Or maybe you just chose to reject the fact that I applied reasonable risk analysis and only used it that way with companies that I am certain won't screw me over?


So same thing as if the merchant don't take Paypal, or if you have AMEX but they only take Mastercard and Visa, etc? But of course that doesn't count, because you've become so used to it that you consider it natural. It would be even easier to accept payment with multiple Bitcoin arbitrators than supporting multiple CC providers!


Yeah, so Bitpay and Coinbase don't exist. You would need to sign up for shit (don't you need a business account to start with to take CC?) first. And for multiple online merchant systems (dozens of them), there's Bitcoin support plugins that you can activate Bitcoin payments with in 1 click. No additional signups whatsoever needed!


So what do you have to say to people with AMEX cards, which nobody here in Sweden supports? You have 2 choices for CC cards if you're going to travel internationally. Signing up for a new one while abroad isn't exactly easy. With Bitcoin? There could easily be dozens of international options, and signing up for one locally when traveling would likely be far easier.


Because it does with CC? Erhm, no. And you're still denying the existence progress outright. This IS getting easier every day, no matter how much you deny it.


It isn't worthy of being called competition when everybody have the same fees and terms and rules and offers. There's no significant benefit from switching.




So you are intentionally ignorant. No surprise there. Schildbach's Bitcoin Wallet already supports the basics of BIP70 (payment protocol), BIP32 (HD wallets, mainly for privacy and simplified backups), NFC payments and more. Mycelium is very feature rich too. Electrum 2.0 is soon ready for release and supports the Trezor protocol and much more for improved security, etc...

You haven't even proven those applications are intrinsically valuable to us, which is another requirement (something that can't be replaced at a task that id itself useless isn't intrinsically valuable). What are there that can't be done in another way that we have to do? 
And TCP/IP could fail as well as HTTP and Unicode, etc... 
Companies all have multiple single points of failures. Protocols don't. Their performance or functionality aren't impacted by external events outside their current applications. Protocols are like languages of trade. They last for ages because people like compatibility. And in these modern computerized days, protocols don't fall along with their country of origin unlike old trade languages. They don't need to be kept alive artificially since they are essentially as "native" to the computers they run on as anything else.

That's not how pyramid scheme is defined. 
They are defined by their structure, that old members earn profits from the new ones, are promised profits, the new ones can't go positive without recruiting new members, old members all the way up the chain get a share of the money those lower down bring in, etc... 
Doesn't work that way with commodities, stocks, etc. Pump and dump is the closest applicable criticism in that regard.

That's an entirely different use case. 
Making it both cheap and secure enough and mass producing it and keeping ahead of counterfeiting is practically impossible for something like this.
Remember that this has to essentially be pocket sized tamper evident hologram sticker authenticated vaults that must resist attempts to scan off the private key from the outside with stuff like electron microscopes. Each of those parts alone makes it hard to prevent counterfeiting. It won't work large scale.
And everybody taking them must educate themselves in how to identify fake or tampered ones, for each and every version. 
At best one might use several small tamper evident pieces bundled for multisig so that one have to successfully forge several variants at once. Still not secure large scale, and then you're exposing yourself even more to misprints of the private keys.

Yes, it's computationally impractical (and that's an understatement!) to reverse this math.
The key point to take away is that you can generate numbers with a mathematical relationship that allow you to use something you can describe as "interlocking formulas" that are easy in one way but hard in the other way unless you know that other secret number.
And this is probably the easiest signature method to understand:

How so? Seems more like they haven't decided how to integrate it (i.e. no idea if scanning tags should trigger anything but the currently active app, a popup, etc, or if having two devices talk over NFC should require the same app open on both sides as the devices might not know how to hire to each other otherwise, etc...

I'm thinking it could be used as an electronic wallet, if you'd add a capacitive touch layer to it. It would be charged from your phone and from any terminal, and all you need is a tap to the terminal to link it. You could have that device be the reader (I don't know what form factor you're currently aiming for).
Why do you consider NFC a dead end? You aren't going to have users pick the terminal from a list of Bluetooth devices, are you? That's wide open to MITM, while NFC is an easy way to establish a link directly between two devices.

No, because you calculate the addresses and compare *that*. You don't need the public key to be the same, any private key with the correct address can be used to spend. After calculating 2^160 addresses, you're going to have a private key matching almost every address that can exist.

With 51% - as many as he wish, *given enough time*. To go back 10 blocks with 51% would take 10\*10\*0.98 minutes, after which he now is almost 10 blocks back. He will however catch up after about 10\*10/0.02 minutes or 83 hours, or 3 1/2 days, after which his reversal of those 10 blocks will succeed.
These numbers comes from him specifically having about 51 units of hashing power per 49 units for the honest miners. These are averages as well. Somebody with twice the hashrate (67% vs 33%) will pull it off much faster. 
Rolling automatic checkpoints like that can cause new nodes who only first saw the malicious chain to be permanently isolated from the network of honest nodes.

How easily have you been able send money today to an arbitrary person you don't know the contact info for, electronically? With cash you just take some up and hand it over. Now with Bitcoin anybody can receive coins with a simple tap. You can tap an NFC tag or a scan a Qr code while passing by and send a small amount while still walking, no need to enter any phone number or name or email, just your PIN, which you even easily can wait with entering until later once you feel like completing the donation.

Bitcoin wasn't hacked. Do you mean when Mt Gox got hacked and blamed it on the protocol, when they mishandled it from the start and nobody else did it the same stupid way they did? (they tracked transactions by hash as they first received them, rather than tracking the inputs and outputs in those transactions) 
Also, it uses cryptography, not encryption. Digital signatures and proof-of-work mining. It takes a large majority of mining power to reverse even just a few hours worth of blocks. Look into how the blockchain works.
Bitcoin works because the mining power is decentralized, no single person has majority, and it is a method to establish concensus. The majority will only be able to agree on one version of events, and that is the one which correctly follows the rules. 
Also, entering fake data can't work either. Without a valid signature in the transactions, the money can not be moved. Invalid data in the blocks will cause them to be rejected by everybody. You can not steal Bitcoins that way. 
Think of Bitcoin transactions as a series of digitally signed declarations of transfer of ownership. No signature or invalid signature = rejection of that block.

Do you know if there are something like a combination between bloom filters, Merkle tree hashes and RSA one-way accumulators (which the original Zerocoin uses) where you can have each branch have a list of all its transactions and UTXOs (a list of which are spent and of which are created), where you can simply merge the "roots" from several branches and show they don't contain the same UTXO entries?
That with efficient Zero-knowledge proofs could go a long way to prove branches are valid and don't conflict and allow you to merge several branches. Each merchant could create their own branches, which are merged by larger local organizations or their parent companies, to be sent to miners. 
Edit: and for transaction speed, you can just combine this with multisignature notaries (services like Greenaddress.it).

Bitcoin Core keeps 100 unused addresses for this purpose. It generates new ones over time. So as you create new receive addresses and spends coins, you should make new backups.
Deterministic wallets (Armory, Electrum) only needs one backup since all addresses are generated from the same single seed, and can be regenerated later.

But who would change your vote? If you do choose, your own hardware will generate and encrypt the vote, and using the Secure Multiparty Computation system, no single human can see what is in it or manipulate or replace it. If your nonce is in the output, you know it came from your correctly counted vote. 
Breaking Secure Multiparty Computation is only possible with a majority of colluding participants, and that is something you would notice on this setup, in particular since they would have conflicting interests and strongly guard their nodes. 
An error could at most be because of excluding votes, but since they are encrypted and can be anonymously submitted anyway, they can't selectively reject chosen votes. Even that can be mitigated by them collecting votes and publishing continously updated Merkle tree hashes + vote count of them so you can check your vote is accounted for, and the Secure Multiparty Computation system also includes the Merkle hash + number in the signed output.
And when the actual counting starts, the Secure Multiparty Computation system has to use the same Merkle hash algorithm to verify that all votes are accounted for, and it won't sign the voting result output if any of the security checks fail. Again, you can't tamper with it without a colluding majority. 
You can also have the voting registry entity which calculates the Merkle tree hash to sign all submitted votes, so if it is missing from the voting result's Merkle hash although being signed (and again, anonymous submission is possible), that's evidence of vote exclusion. Them refusing to quickly include votes in the "checkpoint" Merkle tree hashes would be quickly detected. 
And the system can trivially reject invalid votes and doublevotes.

How often do you trust a person based on nothing but a description of them, no matter how much you can ask and how truthful the person who describe them is (such as "my friend wants to borrow your car", and you trust your own friend but knows nothing about that person)?
You'd want to meet them in person, right? Because we determine trust on a ton of things that can not always be expressed in words. A large part is subconsious, and you often won't even realize what it is that triggered a reaction in you until after you acted on it (like something in his voice, making you decide to take a closer look at that guys driver's license).
Although we don't need *all* of that when trading. We can go quite far with some degree of transparency (where the blockchain is perfect), "persistence of pseudonym" (building a reputation over a long period of time), having something at stake (both a reputation that is hard to rebuild and funds in escrow) that makes it costly to pull of a scam, a review system / web of trust tied to the pseudonyms, etc...
But once again, so far nobody has really solved how to represent trust to a user that allows him to make a good decision (or how to gather the required information!), in a way that can't be manipulated (it shouldn't be trivial to generate a ton of fake identities and rate yourself 5/5). What do you show them? Average review score? How many steps away they are in the web of trust? How will a user use that information to determine how likely it is that *this trade* will go through successfully?
@_date: 2014-12-22 14:41:04
The simplest ways is either zero-confirmation transactions (i.e. the merchant just makes sure the miners have seen it) for low values, and multisignature notaries (Greenaddress.it and bitgo) for larger volumes (those companies provide assurance that there's no doublespend, and they will only be trusted for as long as they're honest, proving malice is as trivial as showing two conflicting transactions both signed by then). 
Both those options provide sub-second speed. The former is unprofitable to attack for small transactions, the latter is as secure as the company providing the service (and it is unprofitable for them too to violate their trust), and once the transaction is confirmed in the blockchain you have the standard Bitcoin security level.

They use 2-of-2 multisig addresses (P2SH), and their service will (promised by them) never sign two transactions with conflicting inputs (doublespends). So the users can't doublespend from their service. And a doublespend from their service wouldn't be hard to prove, so they have very little incentive to try (if they did, it would kill their reputation).

There's nothing inherently illogical about a social framework violating NAP. Long term game theoretically at a disadvantage if you want a stable peaceful society? Then yes (in this view you would be right, but you're claiming an *absolute* rather than *subjective* position). But what if that isn't the goal? There are goals where NAP violation is beneficial, thus a logical act. They just aren't typically beneficial to the majority.

@_date: 2014-08-13 15:26:26
Nope, all you need is to have the master public key on the server and track which addresses have been assigned to what order.
Let's say you just implemented it from scratch and get order  then you let the address generation software derive deterministic address  from the master public key, and you make a note in your database that address  (number and actual address) is reserved for order  Then you check if the order has been paid or not in the same way as before. This can be event driven = runs when an order is made, rather than being a daemon/service. You just need to make sure addresses aren't used twice for different orders, so the code assigning addresses to orders should be in one single thread for all orders to avoid race conditions (or if you use several threads, every N address is dedicated to every N thread, like 1/3/5 and 2/4/6 for two threads). 
The seed / master private key isn't even on the server at all, ever, and you can always regenerate all the same addresses from another computer.
@_date: 2014-08-12 15:28:41

You said "only solution". Also, note that with Bitcoin multisignature script addresses (P2SH), the escrow can't run off with the money, they only decide if the transaction goes through or not based on the given evidence.
Do you think that is impossible to make work reliably without regulation? Unlike some of the other fields of businesses where there often are problems, escrow services can easily be competitive enough to make sure that only those with a good reputation survives. Regulation only does good where the competition is weak and the incentives on the market doesn't align with the interest of the customers. But that's not much of a problem here.

Absurdly slow in between banks.


Hopefully that will change. That's no fault of Bitcoin itself.


It certainly *can* be in some cases. Once you understand Bitcoin wallets, payments are far faster (scan a code or click a link, if required enter your pass or PIN). The merchants have incentives to promote it (some set a lower price for Bitcoin payments to pass on the savings, like Gyft). There's no risk of a merchant getting hacked or an employee getting your CC number and spending your coins.


Escrow/arbitration. Using multisignature transactions it can be very secure and have a lower overhead than the current system.


There's been several cases right here on this subreddit of people posting about how unpredictable the fees are internationally and about cases of even higher total fees (several banks in a row can charge fees). One of them were one that manufactures scientific instruments, with some custom jobs.
Also, there's a whole lot less details and numbers to enter to make the transaction (no need to know your bank's international code or the exact spelling of whatever name your account is registered on), and there's mistyping protection by default (the checksum in the addresses).


Bitpay &amp; co takes care of the volatility for you if you're a merchant.
And there's even one USD denominated Bitcoin wallet.

Showing block data wrong (all kinds of details being incorrect). Being behind by hours frequently. Showing series of transactions as valid and confirmed despite having a big part of the chain being unconfirmed due to one being a non-standard transaction. Tiny password stretching level - 100 rounds is ineffective against bruteforce. 2FA seems to be routinely bypassed (no SMS received). Frequently not correctly saving imported keys, causing lost coins since there were no valid backup. 
That's just the surface.

Why would I2P be worse in this regard? It uses DHT mainly to find the nodes chosen as tunnel endpoints (so you can build your own tunnel to use to connect to it) when you want to connect to I2P services. I don't see how directory services would be an improvement. In fact, I2P just simply seems better, IMHO.

Everything is vulnerable to piracy, because no matter what you do, there's no way to stop anybody from making and sharing copies.
You can prove to a network connected computer that you have paid, because a networked computer can confirm that the chain your payment occurs in is the longest one known globally.
You can't make an algorithm running only on your own computer that can confirm if the actions you tell it to have taken place outside your computer REALLY has taken place or not (such as a payment), which is why you can't do this without a trusted server.
You NEED a trusted server that can verify it's inputs. You can lie all you want to your own computer, so it can't be your own computer that tells if you're honest or not and thus gives access to the file or not, because it can't confirm what you're saying.

And as I said, everybody has an incentive to mine on every block they see. How do you know the second block you see with the same output spent was the doublespend and not the legitimate transaction? Do you still only mine on the first one? What would your criteria possibly be when you don't know what is what? 
You just can't know. 
So there's no resistance to creating tons of parallel valid blocks / forks. 
With Bitcoin, people can pay for more mining by increasing the transaction fee. You thinks it's too low? Pay higher fees. 
Same thing would apply for hacked pools, yes. Lower capital expense, so you won't hesitate as much to use it to break the system. If you can benefit from it failing then you'll be motivated to try. 
And P2Pool needs to take over for mining since it is decentralized itself.

You can have a promise of a fee that is awarded the miner when the full transaction is included. Would require a modification in the protocol.

The hardware designs (see reply) are often first tested on reprogrammable devices called FPGA:s (field programmable gate array). They can mimic pretty much any electronic chip. They are composed of a ton of elements (small circuits) that you tell how to respond to various inputs, and these elements are pretty much connected in a big grid.
If the functionality is correct, you proceed with trying to build actual chips with the circuit design. If it isn't, you have to debug it (it's similar to how you debug software). If it works on the FPGA but doesn't in hardware, then you have to debug your hardware (now this is something entirely different).
You can buy some relatively cheap FPGA:s that you actually can load various ASIC hardware designs on and test them. This includes things like video decoders and even full CPU designs (no performance beasts, but still feature complete).

A pyramid scheme has levels / a hierarchy, Bitcoin doesn't. Anybody can mine, all coins are equal, anybody can buy or sell to/from anybody. No one entity is in charge of issuing coins, it is controlled by the algorithm which the miners can't circumvent. 
It is more like card trading or like gold. 
The whole point is to have a currency nobody can hyperinflate (see Zimbabwe dollars), that nobody can restrict (see Wikileaks), that can be sent internationally incredibly cheaply (unlike Western Union), with zero downtime, that can be accepted globally, that can be more secure (see multisignature services like bitrated.com and Greenaddress.it), that don't infringe on your privacy (see the Target hack), etc... 
Edit: and another big part, when you buy Bitcoins you are then the owner of scarce tokens, you got something for your money right away rather than being given a promise. When you sell, you keep the money and don't pass anything on to another person higher up because there are none. There is only the buyer and the seller.

But my version has no need for a centralized backend, servers are just aggregators of posts in a given set of channels chosen by the server admin and/or the users. In the posts, that is part of the specified metadata (topic, who wrote the post, what channel it is meant for, etc) and all clients can fetch posts from multiple sources and show all kinds of stuff like history trees of which post replies to which ones, do advanced filtering, etc... 
Basically it do what Bitcoin also does to transaction history and puts the raw signed data in focus. 
This also allows you to move discussions between servers as a whole. The moderator went crazy on the last server and blocked everything? Just ignore him and continue the discussion elsewhere, you don't lose the post history of you kept the messages somewhere, just republish on the new server and you can still easily quote them in your new posts. 
And since quotes directly reference their source with hashes, the client can identify and show the posts being quoted for full context, highlighting where in it the quoted text comes from.

Alice published her public key. ECDSA (Elliptic Curve digital signature algorithm) is used in Bitcoin. 
Bob uses ECDH key exchange (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) with his own keypair and the public key which Alice published. This creates a secret value that both Alice and Bob both can recreate, but nobody else knows it. ECDH with the private key of Bob gives the same result as ECDH with the private key of Alice and the public key of Bob. This is a neat feature of the Elliptic Curve cryptography algorithms (some other algorithms have this too, but there's more to come!). 
Now here's the really interesting part - Bob can now use a feature named EC multiply to combine that secret value with the public key of Alice, *which creates a valid new public key!* The remarkable thing is that Alice can now run ECDH with her own private key and Bob's public key to recreate that secret value, and then run EC multiply with it against her own private key to create the matching private key for that same public key! 
This means that Alice only needs to publish one public key, and yet anybody can create brand new public keys which they can turn into addresses that nobody but themselves and Alice knows about, and send her Bitcoins. Nobody will know who the Bitcoins were meant for, even if Alice was offline the whole time. You don't need to ask her for new addresses, you create them yourself! 
The problem is that she needs to find out which transactions were meant for her and run ECDH against all those public keys, trying to recover the funds when possible. This can be sloooow.

With Bitcoin we finally get the ability to pick and choose between all the features we want. We can replicate the previous system and still gain vastly improved interoperability and flexibility.

It is a special transaction. 
Miners take a bunch of valid unverified transactions and sort them. They create a new special coinbase transaction that have no input, unlike regular transactions, which says "address X now has Y Bitcoins" (the Bitcoin clients respect this because they are programmed to do so).
And in the header they then add the current time, a hash of the transaction list, a random number and the hash of the previous block. 
They then hash that block and check if the output value is below the mining target value. If it is then the block is valid, it is broadcasted to the network and the Bitcoin clients will agree that the miner now has Y coins at address X. If the output isn't below the target, they try a new random number or order of transactions to change the hash value, then check again. 
So finding a block whose data has a hash below the target determines if they get the block reward of not.
Edit: computers with the software following the protocol plus the ledger (history of transactions) together is what makes the Bitcoins "a thing".
Game scores are a thing because people respect the game rules. Same here.

Yes, and they did that when implementing P2SH. Miners that wanted P2SH to be implemented added a certain flag in their blocks. When a certain ratio of blocks in a given period of time had that flag, it was considered to have been accepted by the majority of miners. It then got implemented.

What private key your Bitcoins belongs to can only be changed through making a transaction that sends them to a new address and its private key. 
Think of Bitcoin transactions as taking a few lumps of gold (inputs from incoming transactions to your addresses), melting it together and splitting it up in new lumps of gold (transaction outputs) which are then assigned to new addresses (this includes your own change money).
Deterministic wallets create all of its addresses and private keys based on a single seed.

Malicious forks are disruptive or attempts to claim all fees or reverse transactions. 
So how do you prevent doublesigning from happening if there's network issues (network split, equally long forks, you now need to settle on one)? What if the chains are equally long? Why is chain length trusted when nothing stops a malicious fraction of the network from increasing the block creation rate? 
With Bitcoin the block hash is also the proof-of-work proof. Also, what if one of you have far more blocks than the other? What if the last few blocks differ? How do you decide anything?
Edit: all I see there is ways to trip the alarm for the majority of DPOS clients on a daily basis, no real security measures. You know what happens when the alarm goes off daily?

Sorry but that's not how it works. You're assuming equal conditions and a goal that isn't necessarily the real one. Go read about game theory on security, Bruce Schneier has a good book named Liars and Outliers. Alice might want to hurt Bob no matter the consequence, or only need the item temporarily, or think she can hide it well enough. If she makes the assumption that her goal has a reasonable chance of being fulfilled and that this option is the most optimal one, then she will take that action. The asymmetry in power and capabilities is why you are wrong. 
The conditions where only cooperation is beneficial to every single individual is rare.
This is why Bitcoin is so successful, Satoshi found a way to make malice and defection doing miners unprofitable, and cooperation profitable. But outside the sphere of Bitcoin it rarely is. 
Often the optimal choice for the individual is defection and malice. Then it is highly logical for the individual.

That only means that the transactions buying the coins have to be from the same chain, and while you can't sell coins and by more and then use both sets at once, you can STILL use sold coins later on. So buying and selling tons of coins early on can be used to wreck it once it starts growing.

If it can be done separately, then of course it can be combined (even if only the combination just consists of bundling them by default and saying "this is the new standard").

Once again, I already understand the different contexts and can tell that some of them are implausible and that some are likely. Usually when something I don't know is used I can guess what it means based on what is probable and what isn't. 
The problem arise when people talk about the definitions that the reader don't know, and there's no obvious clue to it being wrong. What would make the average person think that a 256 bit key isn't one that costs 0.00025600 bitcoins? There are so many usages of bit that will seem valid when assuming another definition, where they only can tell which is correct of they understand THAT context (i.e. knows about the usage of bits in cryptography), just knowing the definition of bit = microbitcoin won't help them realize the difference. 
So again, people WON'T always be able to tell that the definition they know isn't the one in use when talking about bits. That's the whole problem.

That's RSA (encryption and signing is the inverse of each other). ECDSA is a bit different. 
ECDSA works a bit differently to generate a string (the signature) you can verify to have been generated using the private key belonging to that public key.
Also, nothing is encrypted in Bitcoin. Transactions explicitly say "send X coins to address Y from Z", followed by a signature from key Z. The signature is verified to have been made by Z for the transaction to be valid. From then on Y can spend the coins as they were assigned to him.

Not possible. You can't have a public algorithm only release data as a result of the lack of a given input, because anybody can run it in a VM and get the data trivially. 
The type of blackbox cryptography required isn't believed to even be possible either in the first place, so there's two major holes. 
If none of the data needs to be secret at all, then Bitcoin's nlocktime would work. But again, it can't keep anything secret.

8 Diceware words is lg( ( 6^5 )^8 )/lg(2) = 103.4 bits of entropy. The upper estimated limit today of what a large organization can crack is 80. 13 words represents 168 bits of entropy and thus exceeds the protection that the RIPEMD160 hash in the addresses provides.

You can compute the full public key from the compressed one and vice versa. There's no real difference in strength when the public key is known. 
And either way, RIPEMD160 has 160 bits of entropy, less than that of the compressed public key. The public key representation isn't the limiter.

You need a scarce resource that can be algorithmically provably spent only once, globally, in a secure manner. So far only proof-of-work does that reliably. 
To perform it you first needs to get a lot of coins in the chain. If you can steal enough, you can make it crash. Wouldn't be profitable to buy the coins to do it unless you can sell *really fast* before the price crashes.

I think you are overestimating people's ability to tell when other people are *using a definition they don't understand*, in particular when the sentences *seems* to make sense when assuming the other definition.
I've seen people get confused before over hearing a word used with a meaning they haven't heard of before. And you can't always get them to understand that there's an entirely different definition in use, they often try to parse what they hear as they perceived it (with the wrong definition, that is the only one they know). 
Computer memory won't confuse most people who have heard of computers even if they haven't heard of RAM before. The definition of computer memory isn't that different or complex compared to what they'd otherwise expect. 
But 256 bit keys? 64 bit CPUs? Megabit Internet connections? There are no easy way to explain it so that the average person will understand it isn't related to the monetary definition. There's nothing that hints to the average Joe that it *isn't* the definition they expect in use, to them the sentence just seems strange. That WILL lead to people making flawed assumptions.

As Coinkite has custom readers and cards, they likely use smartcards that signs a challenge of some sort after entering the correct PIN. No PIN = no transaction. It is technically possible for them to directly create and sign a transaction (but the don't need to, they're linked via internet to Coinkite and Coinkite only, and thus only needs to authorize transactions which then Coinkite creates and publishes). 
What they likely do is to have the card tell the terminal "this is my ID number", and the terminal tell the card "the user entered this PIN, and here is a hash of the transaction data", then the card either signs the hash or not depending on if the PIN was correct or not. Then the ID + transaction details with hash + signature is sent to Coinkite for verification. If your card really signed it, they approve the transaction. 
With a device like what I suggested, they can't even command it do so anything even with the PIN. They can't send a radio signal that says "here's the PIN, sign this", because the PIN needs to be entered ON the device. You need to actually hold it and press buttons on it. 
With CC NFC cards, there is automatic authorization WITHOUT requirement of entering a PIN for most transactions. I don't think the actual CC number is transmitted, but that doesn't matter because it will accept anything.

A very large part of the fraud is such simple things as stolen credit card numbers online and various employes copying your CC details, being used to buy all kinds of expensive things.

So you blindly assume that the existence of iBeacon payment solutions means they won't need an per merchant app to work and must be secure? That's a bold and dangerous assumption. 
If you decide to use it without any mechanism to prevent MITM, I won't feel sorry when you lose your money. 
NFC can work with ANY system, fully interoperable, with zero concern for MITM. That's entirely impossible for BLE / iBeacon, it can't be secure without an app per merchant. Physics don't allow it! Even with a registry by a shared payment processor, BLE isn't secure due to the triviality of getting names registered similar to the merchant you are attacking (same problem as with fake domain names). 
If per-merchant app-free BLE / iBeacon payments take off WITHOUT a massive surge in fraud, I'll take that bet. If it takes off with an app per merchant then there's nothing special about it at all, and just becomes a nifty way to launch the relevant merchant's app in order to pay.

Again, only if the cooperation can be sustained. 
Also, if there's no group of honest miners larger than the largest cooperating group of selfish miners, then that group of selfish miners will have the largest share of cooperating mining power, i.e. nobody will on average be able to mine longer chains than them, meaning that the last honest miners to switch to selfish mining, shifting the fraction of honest mining to below what that selfish miner has, essentially gives away the power to perform a 51% attack to that group. In other words, you lose on trying to use this method to compete in this circumstance. 
I don't see any other situation than three 33% miners doing selfish mining as being sustainable. And that won't last long either.

It is FFS nothing easy about making money appear out of thin air by magic just to make sure that if you get charged before you're paid because of other people screwing up, you won't get overdraft fees. Some people don't have the luxury of having enough margins for that, they just don't make enough money and have too large expenses they can't get rid of. They might be masters at economics, but the banks deny them the control required, the control you say they should be using which they actually never were granted. They just don't get any say in when what happens or how. 
Seriously, tell me exactly what they CAN do if they are low on funds but know they have the money required to pay for everything, but the banks refuse to cooperate?

Why "should"? It is a recoverable attack, because it can be detected quickly and reversed afterwards. The security model of mining relies on a cooperative majority following the rules because it would be more profitable than defection. Unless GHash is run by a well funded malicious entity, their high hashrate is only moderately problematic as it shows a large part of the miners haven't understood what the most rational behavior is and why (bad risk analysis), which won't last forever because the amateurs can't keep up forever in increasing their hashrate next to the hardware experts.

How do you determine a fork is malicious? Just simply not including transactions or stake from another known fork? What about network isolation of targeted nodes to make them mine on a separate fork, getting their stake blacklisted (trivial if you're an ISP, NSA or otherwise control the network connection)? What about simple history reversal? And with rolling automatic checkpoints, aren't you just making network split attacks easier? 
With Bitcoin you can change mining algorithm up move to GPU:s, or weigh in spent coin age and add a penalty to small blocks, look for patterns in the blocks to blacklist, etc... Not to mention it isn't profitable to 51% Bitcoin. You need serious custom built hardware. Cooling isn't trivial either. And for how long do you run it? 
You can compare the sum of proof-of-work behind your chain and that of others far easier over say the phone, or again Morse code, top detect if your node is under attack. You just need to know somebody else has a fork with more proof-of-work. But with PoS? How do you know anything for certain? 
How do you even know the delegates behaves honestly? How can you be certain another chain won't be selected?

Why do people buy anything tech? Wait a month and there's something better for the same money. 
Forks are not a problem, checking the computing power behind one is trivial. Pump out invalid blocks and they won't even propagate, pump out forks and your blocks will be old most of the time when they are published and dismissed. 
Creating tons of doublespends also won't get more than a few propagated, and even then the next person to mine a block determines which one is valid (the first one they saw). 
Creating anything that both is valid and up to date that you can get propagated in the network is expensive, the only thing you can do is to flood it with dust transactions with proper fees. And even then miners can discard most of them, and regular nodes can choose to not relay them.

I don't think there's any network that can prevent that with enough certainty. Without information theoretic security models you simply depend on being able to avoid getting trapped in the matrix and finding other honest nodes. The best you really can do is sacrifice performance and use algorithms that only require any subset of users to be honest in order to make their individual activity indistinguishable from each other. This essentially requires all traffic to pass through all nodes.

Also, even the best cryptographic payment systems in the past mainly just tried to do exactly what banks already did, usually couldn't do as much (certain classes of features were impossible) and simply expected the current bankers to use computers and cryptography to what they are already content with doing based on trust. They were designed to interface with the existing banking system without doing much more than essentially just being a bit more hacker resistant where banks normally would rely on doublechecking and insurance instead. The benefits was far too limited. So the banks didn't switch. 
Those who tried to not be run by banks or be integrated with them still had the previously mentioned problems of single-point-of-failure, still relying too much on trust and more. 
None made switching worth more than the switch would cost.

SPV wallets verify the proof-of-work. This is incredibly expensive to fake. Full nodes verify that and transaction data. You can't fool them.

Don't know. No. Yes, full control (you can import and export keys). Not deterministic, that's coming in future. No limits or something like that yet. On the blockchain, it's like Electrum. I don't know about message signing, but probably no. It is open source.
Greenaddress.it will implement options for limits and has deterministic (not BIP32) multisig based on a seed value you hold, and allows for watch-only login. You can recover your coins with an nLockTime transaction they send you when you make deposits, in case their service goes down. To use the notary/green address function, you need to redeposit coins that have had the nLockTime transaction expire (doublespend protection), and then you get a new one. It is on the blockchain. When you set a PIN, it is used with scrypt to encrypt the seed locally. Open source client. Using their web client instead of the local client is about equally secure as blockchain.info.

Either the recipient can lie about not getting the key, or the server can cheat the user by not giving it out. Even if Zero-knowledge proofs can prove the key was published encrypted to the user's public key, by that point the user have paid already and the server can refuse to send it. You can't have the user gain a copy of the key magically only by having a payment registered, somebody needs to send it from somewhere.

Oh really? A sudden peak from almost zero bandwidth have to ten thousand connections each with incoming transactions that have to be ordered and verified? That won't crash anything? Will all miners be high cash capacity servers? 
All you need when you're on the list of miners is to create a long chain that would benefit you as much as possible and hope it wins. There's no downside to trying to generate one that lets you do the future mining more often than on average.
And how do you select between chains where the highest prioritized miner wasn't mining? If the prioritized miner can publish his block with a delay where he guaranteed can replace the block from miner  in the priority list, then he can even doublespend freely.
Edit: And you can't tell the difference between your own network access being limited and the intended miner intentionally delaying his block. So you can't fairly punish somebody else whose block was seen late.

You can even amplify the difficulty by selectively removing a few bits here and there from the keys and forcing bruteforce guessing for some of the sub-chains.

I don't understand what your point is anymore. 
The problem with drugs is that too many abuse them. I agree that the laws are too extreme, but I doubt total legalization would work (too many people can't just stick to safe levels, same as with alcohol, so at least there should be *some* limits). And very few drugs are free from side-effects, including long-term effects. 
Can we only ban everything or nothing? Can't we have reasonable laws? Can't we allow for any powerful tools to exist because some abuse some of them? Can't we focus the most effort on preventing that which causes the most harm? Some of the rules that is claimed to be against money laundering can't really have any effect against it unless the launderer is a total retard, and yet they add a huge burden on absolutely everybody who handles money. 
The crime which causes the harm should be targeted. Intentionally aiding crime may be targeted. But if you want to make it absurdly burdensome to handle money whatsoever to prevent what you can't prevent (how many criminals got jailed in the HSBC case?), why aren't you trying to stop Tor, proxies and encryption in general too?

The fees depends on the total size of the transaction and the age of the inputs, and if the value of any of the inputs or outputs are too low then that will set a minimum limit on the fee that most of the network would require for it to be accepted. Small transactions with a few old inputs of a value that isn't too small can be fee-free, most other transactions requires some fee.

Wages already lag behind when prices rise, and the poor already feels the price inflation the most and get pay raises the last. Deflation won't magically make it worse, unless you think the value of the paycheck will automatically be reduced just because there is deflation. 
The poorest rarely even have loans because they can't get them. All that would happen to them is that their pocket money increase a bit in value instead of losing a bit of value. 
You don't seem to look at the values in all the transactions you really about. You are talking about decreases in the nominal numbers, but not the values transfered. 
Deflation doesn't tax anybody. You seem to be talking about a specific type of loans that indeed would make it worse for those people. Doesn't mean loans can't or won't be done in another manner that doesn't have that kind of negative effect. 
I'd argue that loaning out to much is just as bad. It wrecks the incentives, often increases risks for no good reason, causes meaningless collateral damage when somebody can't pay back, causes instability that otherwise would be easy to avoid, etc... Everybody's fees goes up, the people involved ends up in the deep end and keeps costing others money until they're back on track, it makes people nervous about their finances (which is bad for your health), and more.

Some Qr code generators don't use randomness when generating the error correction codes, instead they use a fixed input. They always generate identical Qr codes.

For most people, risk estimation is broken in tons of ways. This is well known among psychologists. We don't usually realize it because we usually don't screw up so badly that we die more than once in our lives.
I'd say lets start with statistics. Use real-world data to figure out what kind of damage is caused and how often by all these actions (taking individual differences into consideration!). And data for how to identify the situations that are risky.
What's the risks in the normal and reasonable situations? What's the risks we are willing to accept? What's the riskiest thing any reasonable person have to do during their lifetime that we shouldn't punish them for (due to it being caused by circumstances outside their control)? And what risks isn't acceptable under any circumstances?
Then we set a base level somewhere around there for what's too risky, where the actions that carry unjustifiable risk gets responses in such a way that people are disincentivized against doing it. The punishment should offset the personal gain, so that you won't benefit from it.

Anybody on the network, by modifying some bits at random or swapping the order of something. Then transmit the modified copy.


You don't. You're essentially performing a very particular type of doublespend, you hope that your modified copy gets into the blockchain - and if that transaction was a payment to you, you still get your coins. And if the sender only looks at the transaction ID, you can tell them that transaction never verified and they'll see the original transaction ID isn't in the blockchain. If they're dumb and don't log what outputs they used to spend to whom, they'll think you didn't get paid and they'll pay again when you contact support.

They will probably never do that.
Just the fact that it will need enough qubits to hold the entire block data in order to be able to even attempt to generate a Merkle tree hash (so it can reorder transactions for higher entropy) in order to even just HAVE A CHANCE at hashing at a competitive rate so it can find a header that is valid. 
Then there's the problem of programming it and achieving coherency and correct superposition for all the qubits for such a complex set of algorithms and all of its its input data (random sort, Merkle tree hash, partially randomized timestamp for entropy, SHA256, etc), read out the values (an entire Bitcoin block of data), run correction algorithms on a classical computer as well as check if it was correct or not (even if this can run in parallel, it is a bottleneck if slower than the quantum algorithm), and to do that in within 10 minutes from the previous block.
Even then, such a quantum algorithm would have a tiny probability of success, not to mention that even a correct block would often contain bit errors due to the probabilistic nature. Even if you really do square the difficulty for the SHA256 hashing, you must then also run it at the square of the speed per hash (an equivalent of 100 000 000 hashes per second is your target speed? You have to run close to 10 000 rounds per second on your quantum computer - good luck at even reaching 1 per minute!). And you still won't completely square the difficulty, all the other algorithms mentioned will add to the overhead which makes the probability of success worse than squaring it, meaning you'll need much more than 10 000 quantum rounds/second for a target of 100 000 000 hashes/second.

If you receive to addresses whose private keys already arw backed up, nothing more needs to be done. 
This applies primarily to deterministic wallets like Electrum and Armory. 
Wallet.dat includes labels and a cache. All you need is the private keys (the public keys can be derived from them). In the case of deterministic wallets, you have a single seed you generate all private keys to from. The cache can be regenerated when you import the private keys later. 
I would recommend having at least one wallet that is a cold storage wallet, that you do not touch. It should be generated offline and stored offline. And one spending wallet. Or more if you want. 
Use Diceware with 8-9 words for your passwords. 
Truecrypt encryption is good, but the encryption of the wallet clients themselves is also good enough (although wallet clients don't encrypt addresses, only private keys, so that's a potential privacy leak). 
Using multiple backups is a good idea. You should always have at least one that you can recover easily. Deterministic wallets can be backed up trivially, just print their seed on paper. 
Armory has several options for backup. You can print the seed directly, and you can use Shamir's Secure Sharing Scheme to print multiple shares that you need several of to restore the seed, where you can also choose if you want encryption or not for both of those options. You can have those shares both on paper and as PDF files stored wherever you wish.

IBLT is a way to show which transactions you have in common with somebody else without listing them all. 
The only way if they have none of yours is to publish them all. If they have them all, you technically only need one hash.

If the difference indeed is smaller than the chosen limit, the recipient of the IBLT blob will have enough data for him to recreate the missing transactions (IIRC).

Why it would be profitable IF THEY COULD COOPERATE, yes. Cooperation won't last within pools, however. And besides, a 51% pool is undesirable due to distrust, risk of lost value of the coins if you're suspected to abuse the system. 
MAD is relevant because selfish mining is essentially a way of destroying the resources of others, every secretly mined chain is countered with another, the result is that everybody loses (lost value of the coins, the whole functionality of the blockchain is compromised, nobody can cash out at all, so ALL mining resources is lost). You avoid it because others will enter an arms race against you if you try to abuse it for profit, because they risk losing more if they don't provide deterrence through risk of your own destruction (bankruptcy). You don't need to know who is doing it, you can cause them to lose out anyway. Anybody doing it on a large scale know others will retaliate (mutually and assured, doesn't matter who does it, it will be done against them anyway). It will be costly for everybody (mutually), but the intent is to ensure the risk of trying is too high (assured). 
You don't go for a war, you only perform minor opportunistic attacks here and there. 
Prisoner's dilemma was already explained sufficiently, IMHO. Not an ideal comparison, but the basic idea is similar. Everybody loses if everybody defects. But here the potential reward isn't even worth the risk.

If you control your own miners, you decide what chain they mine in and what transactions they include. You need to stop them and her from connecting to the main network to keep the transactions from going through in the global blockchain. 
And yes, it would be that slow as you say. This is only good for targeting the intermittent user. 
The victim's wallet client can send unconfirmed transactions depending on previous unconfirmed transactions if it is configured to allow it, and many are. So they can keep in sending. You can then put them in your fake chain. The next time they go online they think it went through.
If a user gets suspicious too soon and check the chain from a different connection, you fail. If they get contacted by the person they are dealing with and the source of the differences is traced to the chain fork, you fail. If the client connect from another network and gets the real chain, you fail.

Perhaps you don't understand that client side logic is a perfectly acceptable way to implement it. Its not like the act of signing for a received package is something inherent to the physical movement of packages. 
It can only be considered more dependable for receipts when the recipient is uncooperative. That's only a very a small fraction of all messages. 
Digital signing beats paper signatures in showing who really did what. They're billions of times harder to forge.

You don't have to care, but pretending it won't matter to anybody ever is quite dumb.

Nobody can force unwanted changes either. It also won't fail just because some server upgrade failed. There's no censorship either (see Wikileaks). And you don't need permission to interface with it, so innovation can happen faster.

Standard bitcoin addresses are based on public keys. Standard transactions references payments made to those keys, and uses a script with signature verification that proves you've got the right private key to spend those coins.
Since it's a basic scripting language, you can do a few interesting things like multisignature transactions and time locks. But normally you couldn't enforce the use of a specific script, as in you couldn't guarantee some coins only could be spent using multisignature transactions unless you first created the transaction and then deleted the private key - a process that have tons of issues.
Then P2SH was introduced - the script becomes the address! Then you can enforce usage of multisignature transactions by creating a script template that says which keys to require signatures from and more, and then you can send coins directly to it. Then you can't cheat it, your buddies can know your collective cash stash only can be spent from if everybody signs, and you can refill it without that money becoming unspendable (a signed transaction can't be updated to reference new coins if you no longer have the private key).

Red balloons would only be a problem if you only connect to random nodes only. There's plenty of organizations with an incentive to ensure most transactions are quickly verified. They'll happily receive transactions from anybody (including end users themselves, wallet services, payment processors, etc - entities can have multiple roles). They'll happily share this with all miners. Send your transaction to multiple public nodes and the network. Done. 
That plus the fact that the attack is assuming a naive fork selection mechanism (there's other methods than the default naive one that won't give the attacker an advantage). And they face issues with speedy distribution. And if everybody does this, no attacker is better off than before. 
On that link: Gold being shiny is no more special than Bitcoin having a scripting feature, providing features in demand which nothing else can meet. The industrial use is tiny compared to the total. +90% potential loss isn't something to brag about when comparing to the alternatives, no matter how they fare. Once the demand has stabilized, and the supply has stabilized, you'll have a fairly stable value. I don't see the difference from gold other than in how long it's been around. That article seems very short, with no interesting arguments.

Those kinds of payment processors used when buying houses aren't really relevant in this discussion, because this was about problems with credit cards and chargebacks. This was specifically about exposure to fraud. 
No card have all reasons listed, ever. Both to make it harder to avoid detection and for competitive reasons. You can not find a credit card where the issuer will not ever freeze your card for an unlisted reason. They have tons of metrics that estimate the risk of fraud and they will not reveal how those works. 
He didn't want to use his regular credit card, he wanted separate a preloaded one. Far from all banks offer those, so gift cards become far easier for that purpose. 
I've seen gift cards like that on my local train station. You can cross the border from that station. If you buy one in there assuming you will be able to use it where you're going, did you do something wrong? 


Are you intentionally misrepresenting what happened? He provided Visa with all the papers he had to show, they denied him. What he had should have been sufficient, but they chose to force him to either drop it OR spend MORE than he would recover, causing him to lose more money (he'd be worse off from going to court). They really did nothing wrong? How is that being "guilty"? 
And have you never heard of people dropping court cases before because it would only ever increase the losses because of the expenses? Despite being right? Often it will cost you more to be declared right in court than you'll gain.

Smartcards don't need to use symmetric encryption, asymmetric signatures is an option.

High propagation means high likeliness that most of the miners also has it and it's going to include it in their next block, because the vast majority of miners only accept the first transaction they see that try to spend a certain set of outputs. So if the transaction to you reach enough nodes quick enough, it is unlikely a doublespend that *don't* send you the money will end up in a block instead of the transaction to you.

How do you allow for votes for anything other than predefined choices? How do you use colored coins alone to allow for rating the options, or voting against choices you don't like, etc? And when you start to add that level of granularity, then suddenly you can correlate a large number of the votes to the voters, which also reveals their previously unknown preferences.
(Although I have an idea about a Zero-knowledge proof based version of this which allows for vote fractions to enforce votes that follow the rules and still allow granularity while being anonymous. But it isn't anywhere near complete yet. And it likely can't express all types of opinions anonymously.)

Setting up the wallet should ideally be a single-stage process. When you open it the first time, the option to create a new wallet should be highlighted. You only have to open Mycelium and Bitcoin Wallet for them to generate addresses and be usable right away. People might very well just stop in the middle of the process.
And you should be able to set the PIN and two-factor options on the same page, and instead of having small tabs for the textboxes to enter details for the various two-factor options there should be checkboxes that would make all the relevant textboxes to be visible at once. Ideally you'd have the option to enter PIN and to set two-factor options just below the mnemonic, and then tapping Next would open your new wallet.
The social networks page shouldn't be part of the setup process, instead I think you should put a link to that part of the settings page on the Receive page, so that when people open that page to receive coins they see they can do it via their social network accounts as well. Probably in the address book as well ("add people by social network account").
The settings page could need some tabs. Right now it's somewhat long and most people will probably not scroll down the entire thing, and won't find all the settings they might want to change.
On Recieve Money you can enter a private key to sweep, but there's no option to scan a Qr code with a key in it unlike Mycelium.
You can't see the current exchange rate directly, and you can't see it at all if your wallet is currently empty. Both Mycelium and Bitcoin Wallet can show the current rate.
The other wallets also always have the address much more directly accessible for receiving money.

Every single node verifies all blocks. Mining is about amassing computing power behind a chain, and then all nodes select the VALID chain with the greatest amount of computer power behind it.
Rational miners only add blocks to fully valid chains. 
Attempting to block propagation of the valid chain(s) and propagating a bad one won't work for long, if at all.

The miner that made the block had them propagated to him already. Thus other miners probably ALSO ALREADY have had the same transactions propagated to them. 
Thus they just need to determine *which ones* it is, and if they have them all. If they don't have them all, they just need to get the "delta", the remaining unknown transactions, which likely represent only a small fraction of the total. Not every single one in the block. This helps them to figure out which ones to ask for as well, speeding up that part too.

Paper wallets aren't that hard. Pretty trivial with an Electrum seed. Next Debian version will have Electrum included by default, IIRC, so that will make it even easier. Burn Debian to a CD or load it onto a USB drive with unetbootin, boot, open Electrum, write down the seed and a few addresses.

Note that Bitcoin uses digital signatures, not encryption. So you can't go around locking anything that belongs to somebody else. It is more like that the sender of Bitcoins declare that X of their coins are assigned to lock Y, and only the person with the key to it can unlock them and assign them to another lock.
The public key cryptography with signatures is what allow you to use addresses securely. It is what allow you to prove ownership!

Why can't I? Who can and who can't? Clearly somebody can (otherwise there are no blockchain), and if the isolated target don't see another chain then what will stop me? 
Not just one person, necessarily. There's malware that infect WiFi routers - this way you can mass-MITM users, give them your chain and doublespend doublespend against them. There are thousands of ways to lure people into trades with you where you can doublespend against them. You can make them believe they got their money safely when they don't. Heck, one can hide Reaver in an Android app to hack into WiFi networks with WPS on, look for exploitable routers and upload the malware. You can hijack thousands of routers a day this way if you can manage to get the malware distributed. 
PoW recovers by simply choosing the chain with the greatest work behind it, all nodes will always agree. And you can not trivially attack an isolated node - you MUST create AT LEAST one valid block in your fork, and with 2% of the network power you can create one in on average 500 minutes (10/0.02) or 8h 20 minutes. Which is an incredibly expensive attack. With that mining power you could have earned 25 BTC in mining rewards, so you need to gain more than 25 BTC in a single attack for it to be worth the effort. With PoS you don't need more than a single device like a an infected router in the path of the user, and it can be cheaply automated (replace ads with yours to lure them into a trade, then doublespend against them?).

Describe why. Nobody can overtake the chain of the largest selfish mining pool if the honest miners + the second largest selfish mining pool is smaller than the largest pool (and even then only if the second largest pool publish their chain and the honest miners select that one too mine on, and EVEN THEN they'll be working on separate forks that decrease their chances unless the selfish mining pool sets an exception for this particular case to mine regularly together with the honest miners so their combined power makes them the largest entity). And according to your theory theory, there would be no honest miners left in this scenario. So if the largest pool controls the blockchain due to this, as all other chains are shorter, why split the profits with new people? 
Unless you describe the mechanics or math that shows why they are flawed and why it will happen another way, I'm not going to take you very seriously. If you're only interested in declaring everything wrong that don't agree with you and don't care about helping others learn, you're not being productive, you're just wasting everybody's time.

How many road owners will cooperate and choose to enforce the same set of rules? There can only be so many roads in a given area, and if it's profitable to be strict then almost all road owners will. There's no major advantage to being the only reasonable road owner either. And regarding safety, you just have to be safe enough for people to not be scared away, and not much worse than the other roads nearby. You really don't have much of a choice if a road don't have rules you agree to, other than driving back the other direction and looking for a better one. There's no genuine competition because no two roads can really offer the exact same value to the drivers (the ability to get to the same place in the same way) without compromises. 
How long will you drive to find an acceptable road? Will you even be able to find an uninterrupted path between A and B with acceptable roads and rules?

No, the network effects leads to the dominance of a few options in any given community / society. 
Same with money. Nobody wants to accept every possible altcoin. If nothing else, because there both needs to be reasonable security in the implementation and mining plus demand enough to be able to sell them. Nobody wants to do security review and market analysis of every altcoin.
To overtake Bitcoin, your altcoin needs to be so much better that it motivates both the security review, market analysis AND implementation and the switching costs, THEN it has a chance of MAYBE gaining enough momentum. 
Unless Bitcoin itself gets upgraded first to replicate the previously unique features of that altcoin, which would kill the momentum. So there's an additional layer of risk here.

Keep that paranoia going, you're thinking in the right way about computer security. :)
Fortunately most consumer grade computers actually *do* have decent random number generators. The operating systems gathers data from different parts of the system all the time that it mixes into an "entropy pool" (which only the OS kernel and root/admin software can access) such as mouse position and timing, harddrive seek times, network activity, process IDs, etc...
Already a few seconds after boot most operating systems on regular hardware will have collected entropy that is unpredictable enough to be usable for private keys such as for Bitcoin.

Well whooopsie. Right here they implicitly assume umtampered network connections between the honest set of miners, using stake as the gatekeeper mechanism. Messing with the routing of the links on the ISP level would allow causing arbitary netsplits. 


So taking a bunch of nodes offline (1/3 + 1) stops everybody from making final commitments for blocks. Great! 


NSA must love you. A netsplit inherently destroys staking power by forcing one side to either make conflicting commits or to just simply not commit at all to the majority chain. In a 4 fork netsplit, good luck achieving a 2/3 majority! 


That agreement is useless once there is a netsplit. 
On 6.3, I see no evidence for why those claims are true. How strictly is "good validator" defined? They seem to assume all nodes follow the official protocol strictly with only certain selections modified. In reality every aspect of the behavior can be modified. 
On 6.4, the assumption that groups of nodes will only lock at different heights is absurd and unjustified. 
On 6.5, it implicitly assumes you can tell if a validator is malicious or just poorly connected. You can always randomly leave out stake smaller than yours. 


Brilliant, more incentives for network level attacks. 
And assuming single nodes will handle sudden bursts of the entire planet's transaction stream (round-robin selection of nodes for managing the different roles) and not considering the latency from several nodes timing out in the list is just crazy.

The thing with Bitcoin, through it's usage of hash chains and signatures for authenticating transactions, it WILL remain secure for as long as the cryptographic primitives at secure *with a very high probability* if the majority of mining power also remains honest. 
The probability part is about the blockchain being a probabilistic solution to the Byzantine generals problem. It is proven that you can't solve every instance of it, so Bitcoin settled with solving 99.999999999% of them. We have similar probabilistic solutions for many other things proven impossible. The difference from a full solution is that full solutions ALWAYS works, no exceptions.

You can prune because you have confirmed the transactions you're deleting won't ever again be referenced in the blockchain, so they won't be needed for future validation. 
When you bootstrap from nothing, you don't yet know anything about the blockchain. Those transactions that the pruning nodes deleted will still be necessary *for you* to calculate that very same state they have already arrived at.
SPV nodes essentially already behaves like that, they trust the proof-of-work for economic reasons (faking the chain is expensive), but full nodes BY DEFINITION can't rely on that.

Same thing, there's no hierarchy here. At most it's like stocks if you want to compare to something.


Then what *does* have real utility as currency and is valuable as investment? What's your criteria? What part of the value of USD is "real", and not based on perception? It has all the properties that is required to be useful as money, what's lacking compared to what's already out there?


Besides having enforced scarcity; Multisignature transactions (enables everything from wallets like GreenAddress.it, escrow/arbitration like Bitrated.com, giftcard like services, shared wallets, etc), smart contracts (the seller automatically gets the money when the contract is fulfilled, neither part can cheat the other), smart property (the exact same moment the car is paid for, the buyer gets access), it's faster than anything else internationally, it's one of the absolutely cheapest options, new wallet types like Hierarchical Deterministic wallets (HD wallets) enables advanced accounting features that isn't currently available to 98% of the people on earth for fiat currencies, you have far more choice and can have more control over it yourself if you want (be your own bank) or let somebody else manage it for you (web wallets, including ones with SMS interface), etc...
What does the USD have compared to that? Or any other currency for that matter. Why would people not want anything of that?


Wikipedia: "The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry."
I'd say ALL of it's usage in finance is speculative because it is ENTIRELY based on it's expected value. And I'd say none of the use in jewelry adds to any practical value considering that it's entirely possible for people to go for something else. All the people who want it in their jewelry BECAUSE it's valuable just contribute to the speculative use. Those who only want it because of the look contribute with no value at all because they just as easily could pick something else.
So that just leaves the 10% in industrial use as contributing with non-speculative value.
And before any industrial use was found for it, the speculative value was 100%, for centuries.
Why do you think it should matter that one of them have 90% speculative value and the other has 100% speculative value? You'll still lose the majority of your funds if it tanks. And even then you're relying on gold not getting replaced by room-temperature superconductors showing up or asteroid mining not becoming profitable anytime soon, etc...
And once again, see the arguments above for why people will value it. It has unique properties that are hard to match (and network effects (most people will only use one or two, and you want to use what others are using) + the number of skilled developers behind it + the resources required to perform security reviews on every cryptocurrency continously is why it's unlikely that Bitcoin will be replaced).

Greenaddress.it like P2SH multisignature addresses with nlocktime expiry. This temporarily locks up the coins. The bidder who made the greatest pledge then signs a multisignature transaction for the exact amount together with the auction holder (to prevent simple scams, all P2SH addresses references the same auction by hash of the auction description and the auction holder announce the winner and confirms the list of bidders on the blockchain directly before payment).

Coinbase in particular? Weekly. They seem to often respond slowly. Can take 30 minutes often (not a good match with the 15 minute timer on merchant sites using Bitpay, then you need to contact support to get the payment processed). Occasionally hours. 
I think it is because they keep the private keys controlling most coins offline, their servers control a few. So when people want to suddenly send more coins than the server has, they have to go to their "vault" and give the server more coins. In the same manner, when the server has more coins than they think it needs to hold they send some to the "vault". Fetching anything from the vault takes extra time. 
This method reduces the damage a hacker can do, as they can only access what's on the server but not the vault.

Do you have any idea what you can push through a single fiber cable with the right technology at each end? You can even send multiple signals in parallel for every frequency of light. Using polarization and things like Orbital Angular Momentum and a few more at once, and you can send hundreds of thousands signals in parallel. And every individual signal can reach several hundred Gbps. 
Then you just need more fiber cables once you've filled the capacity of the first. That's like another 5 millimeters in width for the space you're installing the cables in.

For hexadecimal dice you've got 4 bits of entropy per dice and per roll assuming they're reasonably balanced. You just need about 128 bits. That's 128/4 = 32 rolls. 64 rolls provides a good security margin if the dice would be unbalanced.

I think you're misinterpreting how entropy works and why. It does not apply in the sense you think it does. Entropy means order on average decreases in total across the whole system as time goes. Enthalpy (easily usable work potential) decreases as a result also on average over time. And that's for describing whole physical systems.
Any sub-part of the system might go against that trend, and can behave very differently (for example you can have man-made systems with decreasing entropy internally).

What I'd love to see is a kind of generic computation sandbox with the ability to commit to key-value pairs and various rules related to the blockchain and different types of tokens, and even namespaces (think mastercoin / counterparty / Namecoin), allowing you to issue transactions that only reveal a few of the values publicly, and only publishing a hash of the secret state and inputs and a Zero-knowledge proof of validity. 
You could define new currencies with complex rules and have them work perfectly securely on the chain parallel to all others, you could manage resource assignment, and much more, and the bulk of the data would be stored elsewhere, identified by and protected from manipulation by the hash value in the blockchain. 
You could even publish bounties that require that you generate a Zero-knowledge proof of that your encrypted file holds the correct answer, and that the encrypted key in the transaction is the correct key and encrypted with the public key of the issuer of the bounty (the act of claiming the bounty requires making the answer decryptable by the issuer). 
And much more.

Samsung now has higher ratings than Apple. 
There where tons of inventions in cars, of course, but most components are simple. Rubber on a wheel is a good idea, but the important inventions are the ones that made it work well (the rubber chemicals that made it both strong and comfortable to ride in the vehicle). Making the engine work includes tons of important inventions. 
Hooking a wheel to an engine on a standalone frame is a good idea, and was an invention, but the "inventive height" of that alone was nothing compared to making the engines work and making the wheels comfortable. 
And again, what was new other than the polish in Apple's devices?

Don't trust third party hardware to generate and submit the vote? The voter is supposed to use trusted hardware to confirm submission. Once submission is confirmed, only majority collusion can have *any* effect on anything, and every attempt to mess with the vote is VERY likely to be detected. 
The vote count is done once. You don't get to see the difference in the output between including those votes and not because they are either submitted for the vote calculation of not. If you see the plaintext before encryption that is one thing, but if all you have is the ciphertext you can't learn anything about the contents. 
If there aren't a majority of the Secure Multiparty Computation participants colluding, there's nobody at all who are capable of figuring out what's inside the votes. And all SMPC participants must be online at once and be connected since the SMPC can't even decrypt the votes internally without all the shares of the private key.

What would make far more sense is having the transaction include hashes of the input, output and script respectively plus a Zero-knowledge proof of validity, i.e. "the output from this script was indeed generated based on this source from the blockchain and this data, computed with this script, following all the rules". 
There are efficient constant proof size and constant time verifications for some variants of Zero-knowledge proofs.
That way you can even keep all the data secret by not sharing the hashed inputs with anybody else than those who need them! (or you COULD choose to make them public directly in the transaction.)

I'm saying it don't work well for roads because humans inside vehicles don't want to go very far. Data packets don't get impatient after 10 ms of being rerouted. It's much easier to build high quality high bandwidth fiber connections than roads. The incentives are worlds apart. 
Building a road network INSIDE a gated community on land under the same contract isn't as far as hard, and it is easier for the inhabitants to force improvements both because all land is controlled by one entity and because most people in such communities typically already have more wealth and more influence. A gated community can't survive if too many move out. And they're typically designed from the ground up, literally, with maintenance in mind. But who will always only ever travel inside the community they live in? 
But roads in the middle of nowhere? Private land? Rough terrain? There's far less incentive because nobody else can really affect you no matter what you do. Improving the roads just won't bring as much additional traffic to make much of an additional profit, because anybody *who already is there* will need to use *some* road in their physical proximity, and few will plan every single choice of road along the way, and even if they all did the same principle applies - if it's not too bad, people will prioritize the least effort and time spent on their part over quality and even price. It's why gas stations can often get away with 1.5-2x the average prices - you're already there, and you don't want to go look for a better option! 
There will rarely be more than a few competing high traffic paths for any given common route. And even if there's some road owners who want to make their roads great, does it even matter if none of the roads they connect to is well maintained? Do you know what topology maps and network maps are? A bit of knowledge in how they work would make it far more clear why it's hard to build and maintain the full length of all the roads on any given route when there's tons of separate landowners. 
And again, the quick summary - it's more profitable to refuse to maintain it properly.

You can prove 5 was computed once by doing 3+2. However, your actual original calculation could just as well have been (-1)+6.
When there's multiple possible input combinations, a proof doesn't mean you first did it that way, only that it can be done that way. If you later on look up a way to make another input have the same output, you can create your proof for that one instead.
Secret Sharing isn't enough to do computing. MPC + secret sharing allows for computing.

With what volume? How sustainable would that be? Wouldn't a high trading volume index reduce the gains measured in percentages (the same profit split among more people)? 
Diversification requires that there's some notable differences between the different cryptocurrencies. Things like Namecoin, Zerocoin, etc. Otherwise, as I said, the sets of equivalent altcoins will only have a single winner in most cases. 
With altcoins, the technical differences is on average far smaller than different companies or assets are. Let's say Litecoin vs the other scrypt coins, they're more similar than say any given pair of steel refineries. Or farms. Or car manufacturers. So you don't reduce exposure to risk notably by investing in two nearly identical altcoins. But at the same time, the buyers of the index don't get any access to the unique benefits of these altcoins, as I said before. So the index only makes sense if these altcoins have large niches in which they're used extensively, or else they won't be worth investing in.
But if Bitcoin can replicate those features and work in those niches as well, there's no reason at all for altcoin indexes.

It has the obvious advantage that you can publish it. No need to keep generating new addresses for people to use.
Coinjoin can be performed automatically in P2P anonymization networks like I2P. And it doesn't lock up your coins for any notable period of time! Everything related to it can be done in minutes.
Analogies. You have partial data and are trying to get the big picture. It takes tons of guesses, and even then you can't be sure since people keep throwing in decoys.
What information are you trying to extract? The existence of groups that trade often? Or identification of people? The flow of coins? IMHO identification is the major issue, and that one is as good as solved with this.
Zerocoin also reveals the payment details, even if it breaks the connection to the owner in the graph. 
It takes minutes to generate the ZKP to withdraw coins. And it locks up coins temporarily, at least for an hour. So nobody will use it frequently. People are going to use public donation addresses. People are going to use their bitcoins like cash. If people only use Zerocoin once a month, then do you think they can't be identified in the graph? 
And Zerocash lacks scripts, although it otherwise hides everything but the number of transactions.
Ideally, we would actually COMBINE all these three - Zerocoin monthly, Coinjoin weekly or even daily, and stealth addresses for most payments. Then we REALLY break the graph.

Payment processors like Bitpay, large online retailers, large shopping centers (by that I mean high 5 digit count of daily shopping customers and up), various local organizations in various geographies... 
The benefits for them are transaction fees (assigned explicitly), much more reliable and much faster secure transactions (no doublespend risk in this setup if the hub is honest), reduced risk compared to other alternatives with the same transaction speed, interoperability (nobody needs to be worried about lock-in, neither customers or retailers), etc... Essentially the hubs grease up the cogs of their local economies.

As a computer geek, I'm fascinated by how it can be automated by computers. An IBM guy said "on the blockchain nobody knows you're a fridge", only partially as a joke. Your gadgets can have access to their own funds, and your fridge can order new food by itself when it runs out, your car can pay for parking automatically by itself, and the potential in online games is incredible.
There's so much completely new things that can be done since you don't need any permission or to sign any papers to get started, just code. And you don't need to trust anybody else for your security.

The most important thing is that you have the address with you written down in some form. Printing out the address plus a Qr code generated with Zint Barcode studio. 
Use multiple blockchain explorers and/or a watching wallet like Mycelium (import the address only, without importing the private key) to verify that the Bitcoin transactions is listed, and wait for 1-2 confirmations being shown. Once it shows that your address has the coins and is past 2 confirmations, the probability that the transaction can be reversed is near zero for your trade. Usually 1 will be enough, though, but for that sum I'd still be asking to wait for 2.

Except the consequences of a successful attempt didn't happen, you mean. Nothing bad happened (in this hypothetical case). 
The person still intentionally took an action that was very likely to cause harm to another person. 
The intent do not matter all that much to me when you are so reckless, IMHO that kind of disregard for other people's lives is no better than intent to kill. You have already shown that you aren't concerned about their survival. If left unchecked, such people would very likely sooner or later kill somebody anyway. 
What if the shooter claimed he had no intent to kill? What if you can't really disprove he might have shot at random? Then you've essentially got the same situation as the drunk driver above. A high risk dangerous action where the person clearly didn't care if the people around him survived. 
If course it should always be proportional. My motivations are a combination of disincentive against harmful and dangerous actions (strongly signaling that we don't want people to do those things and that they won't pay off), to directly reduce the risk of harm from dangerous people (like locking up serial killers, etc) for the general public, to re-educate those who are willing to change (far more productive than just locking people up for X number of years), and to some degree punishment against those who harmed others (includes killers and other criminals that caused significant damage, because you shouldn't get away lightly, you should understand how the victim felt; excludes all minor crimes).

You mean context dependent situations? Even the real world changes fast. Aluminum used to be more expensive to mine than gold and thus more expensive to buy, now it is far cheaper to extract. Lead used to be popular until we found out it is toxic to us. 
There may only be one gold, but how many uses are there for it where gold EXACTLY matches the desired properties? In electronics it can be eliminated entirely by a strong room-temperature superconductor. In jewelry it is simply a trend (no matter how strong and old the trend is, there is other materials that can achieve the same visual effect), in finance any precious metal or similar scarce resource can replace it, and there's hardly any significant use cases left after that. 
Bitcoin will rely primarily on the network effect (this includes having the best developers) and not being significantly worse than the best competitor (if something significantly better would show up, Bitcoin will likely get upgraded itself before the competitor takes over, same with HTTP and SPDY where HTTP 2.0 now is on it's way).

A transaction either goes through or not, and when it has gone through the receiver is in total control. The script doesn't affect what the recipient can do and can't do, only if the transaction is valid or not.

The values themselves doesn't hold the backdoors, instead they make the curve weak and keypairs in it crackable.

When people think Bitcoin can't compete against centralized systems, this is what they don't seem to have any idea about. I always have to tell them about the absurd overhead created by the legacy systems and the accompanying legal mess. Could it be better? Absolutely, but not for the next 10-15 years or more.
Sorting it out isn't easy, at best you can introduce yet another trusted entity (á la PayPal) in the middle with yet another set of rules and laws (they aren't even a bank in USA, and thus have very limited obligations to you). And then you still don't simplify much as the old system remains in place, which means more to maintain for the banks. 
And then there's the sheer resilience of decentralized systems. Any combination of 9/10 of the nodes and miners could go down at any point in time, and the network would remain fully functional.

The difference is that there's usually one single global consistent fork or maybe two for PoW.

Also, another note - Fawkes signatures could be used to manage a transition to a new signature algorithm. It is a timestamped commitment scheme based signing method. You publish a hash of the signed transaction before publishing the transaction.
Then the quantum computer's owner can't replace your transaction (wouldn't match the hash), and he can't generate a valid transaction of his own before he see yours, so he can't publish a commitment hash in advance.

It is really problematic if your physical security is limited.

The problem with that thing is that it seemingly (weird quantum fluctuations unaccounted for) will never initiate. 
However, you can timeloop in a different manner. Build a robot with a time machine that manages a datacenter which it gives instructions, in order to travel into the future to fetch the results, to then go back in time again to give it new instructions based in the former result. It also goes back to collect energy as required, for each refuel it goes a few more seconds back and then quickly again back to the datacenter (which only ever needs a single energy source for obvious reasons, such asba nuclear reactor). 
When the desired result is found, it goes to the chosen place and time to deliver the results. 
Given that the process is efficient enough to loop enough times it can crack anything mathematically crackable.

You can not make it work otherwise. It just isn't possible. Who provides the vetted list of all of pending transactions? How can you be sure a miner who make a block without transaction X saw it or not? You don't, so you can't punish him for it by rejecting his block. You can not be sure everybody will have all transactions fast enough to enforce only accepting blocks including ALL KNOWN transactions older than Z seconds.

While all Bitcoin transactions are public, they contain no identifying information. If you don't tell anybody those coins are yours, nobody will know you have them.
People could however try to detect patterns in your spending to guess what person the address belongs to. They can also attempt to guess your IP when you send transactions. Using Tor to send transactions help, and there's various ways to cover your tracks.

IIRC this is more intended to document the process than to be the proof itself. You timestamp all documents and create a provable chain of them such that you can see exactly who did what when. Then you use that information to determine what's valid and what isn't. Court rulings that alter the records would be recorded as well as part of the chain of documents, and the changes will all be visible.

You might have seen my previous comments on what kind of blockchain tech I'd like to see. I've been meaning to summarize it in a blog post for easy reference, but that haven't happened yet. 
In short, it would be a Namecoin and a counterparty inspired system (and Zerocoin/Zerocash and Factom), where you don't have just one chain with Bitcoin transaction blocks. Instead you have registered "namespaces" / "data structures", where Bitcoin would be one of the predefined ones, where each one follows rules defined in the namespace registration transaction (Turing complete). There would be something of an API defined to allow things like atomic transactions interacting with multiple namespaces at once, consider for example an atomic trade between Bitcoins and a smart property management namespace. And there would be some way to define rule changes, as according to the requirements defined in the registration transaction for updating rules (could be forbidden too). There would be ways to declare what can be safely pruned too. Also ways for transitions to query the blockchain state. 
Edit: also a standard method for namespaces to define APIs outwards, like say "this namespace is labelled as a DNS type and allows you to query for properties XYZ in its entries". Without software with native support you'd still be able to make use of it in basic ways, while software with native support could do much more advanced processing. 
The block headers don't have a Merkle tree hash referencing transactions directly, but rather referencing different blocks per each namespace for which there has been updates. And to prevent computational DDoS, Zero-knowledge proofs with constant time verification (zk-SNARKs, or whatever else that will be first to get a consensus in the cryptography community as being secure and practical) is used to prove that each transaction follows the rules. The proofs are chained - each transaction carries a proof, the block carries one to prove the bundle has no internal conflicts and follows the rules as a whole, the main block header carries one to which shows that all included blocks have been verified. 
One really neat thing is that using ZKP's with hash commitments allows publicly proving that you're following secret rules, i.e. you and a buddy can create a private namespace with secret rules, where the registration transaction says "the rules that has the hash X are to be followed" and where the transactions themselves are encrypted (like in Zerocash) and carries proof of following the rules anyway. Despite everything remaining secret, the miners can verify that you're following the rules and can therefore create blocks containing them without contradictions. 
And to massively reduce the space requirements, checkpoints are created one in a while, carrying Zero-knowledge proofs too of correctly summarizing the full current state of the blockchain. Then you only need headers + they most recent checkpoint + the most recent blocks.

@_date: 2014-05-30 09:02:42
Yes, but keep in mind that if you share the private keys among two wallets they may both get confused and out of sync when you spend from them (different sets of newly created change addresses) unless you use a deterministic wallet like Electrum or Armory and only use the addresses they generated.

You could potentially use an Electrum or Armory Master Public Key on the server to generate a new address for every transaction without the server having any private keys of any kind. A leaked Master Public Key only reduces privacy (the transactions made to you is revealed).
A hacker could however attempt to replace it to redirect payments (so if you are paranoid then an external system of yours should from time to time verify correct behavior by confirming that all payment addresses given by the merchant system are from the same Master Public Key). 
Then you can use Electrum or Armory on a separate computer to sign transactions (even on an offline computer, using an online computer only to check the balance).

Then why don't you tell me what new features and technology they had? You don't believe that some are more effective than others at using their marketing resources? 
Only if the way they simplified it is new. If you take a look at you can see a clear difference between new analogies (inventive) and using simpler wording (standard simplification). Automating existing processes, like making syncing playlists between the device and the computer a default feature instead of something you have to set up manually. Reorganizing menus to make it easier to use. Etc... 
Nothing of that is inventive. 
Not all of those companies focused on user experience. Many focus more on having better specs or simply spending more at marketing. And many of those who DID make it simple didn't have the contacts or resources to market it as well. 
Tell me WHAT was new. Anything other than the packaging?

&amp;gt; There is a physical argument that a 128-bit symmetric key is computationally secure against brute-force attack. The so-called Landauer limit implied by the laws of physics sets a lower limit on the energy required to perform a computation of kT  · ln 2 per bit erased in a computation, where T is the temperature of the computing device in kelvins, k is the Boltzmann constant, and the natural logarithm of 2 is about 0.693. No irreversible computing device can use less energy than this, even in principle.[2] Thus, in order to simply flip through the possible values for a 128-bit symmetric key (ignoring doing the actual computing to check it) would theoretically require 2^128 − 1 bit flips on a conventional processor. If it is assumed that the calculation occurs near room temperature (~300 K) the Von Neumann-Landauer Limit can be applied to estimate the energy required as ~10^18 joules, which is equivalent to consuming 30 gigawatts of power for one year.
I'd love to see the data center which can cool off 30 GW. Or if you try to reduce it to one week, 1.56 TW. Note that this means the whole data center is absolutely maximally efficient and operates at 3 K, the same as -270 Celsius. In the real world, you have an inefficiency billions of times off that scale and it is waaay hotter.

Prisoner's dilemma - if all other cars are designed to drive safely with large safety margins, each individual can benefit greatly from breaking the rules and modifying his car to drive aggressively as the others will automatically avoid him anyway. So every individual has an incentive to break the rules. If there are neither social or legal pressure to drive safely, people won't. And social pressure alone is unreliable, although it can often reduce the number of "infractions" (lacking better terms) to a manageable level if it is clear and strong enough (works worse in large societies).

You can mine your own chain and show only your own block  and forwards, yes. It would be your own fork of it.
You can't go below the difficulty at block  however, so you need a lot of mining power, so if you know she'll be 144 blocks behind you need a bit over 1/144 of the Bitcoin mining power to make a valid block  You can put any VALID transactions you want into it. Including transactions from the real chain to make your chain look legit. 
So you can make her think you paid her when you sent the money to another address of your own on the real chain. 
She can detect that her client has fewer blocks than expected (only one block mined the entire last day?). She can use VPN and Tor to try to get blocks, in which case you have to block that and she'll notice something is wrong.

The difference is that the money "should" be inflated already before you spend them (the moment they are printed), but become deflated afterwards. Value was "created" and given to you when the money was printed, which leads to the value of the units of money going down so that the total value of all the money becomes closer to what it originally was. You get the value today, everybody else loses part of theirs tomorrow.


That bill remains in your pants if a new one is created. In total it becomes easier to earn each unit of money as there's more in supply to earn. Just spending the one in your pocket don't make it easier in total to earn a unit of money.

You update Namecoin entries with special transactions. Those need to be signed by your key (same as the one you registered it with). This ECDSA group signature scheme is designed to work as a clean and transparent drop-in alternative to regular ECDSA signing for Bitcoin, nobody but you and your friends will be able to tell the difference by just looking at the signature or public key.

One can't simply prove axioms false. But I can show if they are incomplete or contradicting or that they have undefined outputs in various circumstances. 
In math there are many sets of alternative axioms where many different sets all are valid, but some are conflicting when combined. Like geometric axioms - is space flat or curved? We can define it to be either one by axioms, but can't define it to be both at once without contradiction. Our math works fine in both, but only match reality for the one "where the map matches the territory", so to say. And division by zero has no output, or is simply an invalid computation (but sometimes formulas that describe a real world mechanism has a situation where you get division by zero, but the real world outcome is undramatic, just the same as interpolating between the results for -0.01 and +0.01).
You have to be very careful to keep your framework close to reality. 
It is worse in the human world because so few actions and circumstances and events are well defined, and deciding on common goals is nearly impossible. That's why so seemingly simple rules like NAP becomes complex. How do you handle responses to a false perceived threats? And the counterresponse? Etc... 
It is easier to use guidelines than hard rules because of all that.

Overlays are still sandboxed. They're just using sidechannel metadata to guess when to show their overlay to pretend to be the real app. That's like looking at another person's manners and guessing when to step in and fake their voice to ask a question you're not supposed to know the answer to.

Carbon footprint isn't a problem. 
1: Because mining will never exceed what is profitable, which in a few decades by now will mean what people pay transactions fees. People think mining is taking too much energy? Pay less in transaction fees. The miners will have to take hardware offline to be able to make a profit due to electricity costs. 
2: Climate friendly energy production. 
3: proof-of-stake doesn't solve the problem because it doesn't guarantee concensus. Bitcoin's proof-of-work forces you to spend each unit of computational power to vouch for only one version of the transaction history, proof-of-stake allows you to mine in every single fork separately, which is the profitable thing to do compared to only mining in one fork and seeing another one win. That's a big problem.
You need to have something provably scarce being probably spent on vouching only for one version of the transaction history.

If DNSSEC + DANE was employed (don't know how well this works together with Namecoin, but could likely be made to work), and the current status of the system was sufficiently public, they could generate and publish zero-knowledge proofs of having correctly imported the Namecoin blockchain data into the DNS system, always referencing the latest Namecoin block hash when updated.
The problem is that proof generation still is slow.

Lightning Network in the current Bitcoin can only allow as many new users to get on board per second as Bitcoin's maximum transaction rate - 2-7 per second (depend on transaction format). 
That's about the same as the current global birth rate. Meaning that if you want to get everybody on, Bitcoin will ALWAYS lag behind and be unable to just get people INTO the system. 
And to let people cash out to the blockchain (settle transactions) doubles the required transaction rate.

P2SH addresses forces you to only make transactions based on one predefined script to be able to spend. That way you can make a reusable address that only can be spent from by fulfilling the chosen terms such as using multisignature transactions. Any coins you send it is instantly bound by that script. 
Regular addresses can be spent from with any script the user wants to use. Unless the private key is deleted after creating a transaction, you can't enforce a specific behavior.

No it isn't. You can't stop your customers from being deceptive and lying to your payment processor. If your payment processor ignores your evidence, there's nothing you can do. This is common in many niches, like I already told you. Are you gonna vet all your customers in advance and require advance payment? Won't work. 
Except VPN providers only end up paying for some hours worth of usage, and typically it is the fixed overhead costs that are one of the larger costs. So the VPN don't lose much at all. If you can not understand the difference between paying a few dollars for the load vs hundreds for an item you shipped, you're a lost case. 10 TB? 333 GB a day for a month? Not exactly very likely unless it is a top tier VPN not directed to consumers. Oh, and bandwidth is still quite cheap, that would likely not amount to more than some two-digit number of dollars. Again, a big part of VPN costs is fixed costs for equipment, salaries, etc... 
If there's "gaps in my knowledge", please try to counter them with evidence instead of mocking, unless you want to be labeled a troll and get ignored. Please look this up. This is real. 
PayPal and Visa have chargebacked transactions where the packages was signed. Package insurance doesn't cover chargebacks. 
Which insurance? Your home insurance, business insurance, package insurance? I've never heard of one that cover chargebacks, please show me the terms of one that do. Seriously, link please. There's dozens of people I know that would love knowing how to do that, because they've gotten fraudulent chargebacks. 
Visa aren't even violating their agreement with you. It says outright they're free to make the decisions at their own discretion in the case of any conflict. You agreed to allowing them to chargeback the money with limited evidence, otherwise you don't have a payment processor. 
And what insurance is that? Link please. Also, what insurance takes clients with that high levels of fraudulent cases that the profit margin is negative? 
"identify areas to mitigate risk" = identify the fraudulent customers before they defraud you. Not always possible. There's no other areas to identify. Will you sue every single fraudulent customer?

For as long as a majority of the computing power spent on mining is cooperative / honest, you can achieve a secure global concencus. Which is what allows us to trust that when the blockchain says we own X Bitcoins, we really do own them.

I know how they both work. I'm not convinced Freenet is more resistant to timing attacks as most nodes won't be actively routing data from other nodes continously, so you'll clearly see X amount of data going in, X amount going out, and then you follow it along the path. If you're NSA, just provide popular data and get a bunch of nodes, and you can identify most users accessing it because you'll see it reach their nodes and not exit within milliseconds from you sending it. 
I2P is resistant to that attack, because when you receive data you also send data you received from others. They can't be sure you were the endpoint. The network is also far more "integrated" (network topology wise, shorter worst paths).
Edit: please try to prove me wrong instead of just downvoting.

Nope, the system uses chained transactions as in payment channels and a form of coinjoin-ish combined transactions such that you keep updating REAL Bitcoin transactions, but they aren't all committed to the blockchain. Think of it like using Bitcoin as a checkpoint system. 
Nobody can steal funds, all a hub can do is to censor transactions (in which case you switch to another hub) and commit transactions from the system to the blockchain which aren't the most recent ones (screwing with expectations, could undo payments and could force people to repeat their most recent transactions). There's various protective measures built in to reduce this risk. 
It is essentially a way to collectively agree on a fairly secure manner on what to put in the Bitcoin blockchain.

You are setting an incredibly low bar for inventiveness. It's already been decided in court that "x but done on a computer" isn't patentable, so what's the bar? IMHO inventiveness is about doing something that is significantly different from what was there before, where you didn't just built things together but combined them in a clever way. So what did Apple do? "Multi-touch but on a smartphone", "GUI with elements of momentum but on a smartphone", etc... None of the features were new, just the packaging. 
Apple didn't invent any of the components, what they DID do was to package it in a new way that people wanted to use. 
At best you can say they invented concepts and "frameworks" for how to make a good interface for the devices, but every part in there was old.

I disagree because it's minor. 
A few decades of mining? It uses less energy than mining of actual gold. If we replace gold, that's a net benefit. 
By 2030 it will be 99% transaction fees. And the fees will always at worst be a fraction of a percent of the total value of the transactions made. The current banking system already takes a much larger share spent on things like armored cars and bank vaults and guards. 
If revenue is below the electricity cost, they HAVE to shut down miner hardware. Or they'll make a loss. You can expect fossil fuels and coal burning to go up in price relative to green energy sources too, so that will solve itself anyway. 
Simple thermodynamics - the light absorbed by the solar cells would otherwise be absorbed by the ground, and contains just as much energy no matter where it ends up. It heats the earth the same no matter if you take advantage of it using solar cells or not. Same with wind, wave power, geothermal energy, etc...

The majority that matter is the majority of the computational power. 
Individual non-mining nodes have no influence, all they do is to propagate blocks and transactions. Invalid blocks and transactions are ignored by "cooperative" nodes. Even if the lying nodes are the majority, the valid chain with the greatest power behind it will win among the cooperative nodes. 
I define cooperative as correctly following the protocol, and I use that term because "honest nodes" isn't a good way to describe for example botnet nodes that follow the protocol.

He talked from the start about that one you assume you've got a hashrate (proof of work) majority that's following the protocol rules, then the majority decides what the "canonical" blockchain is. (With the game theory behind the reward system being an incentive to cooperate) 
Satoshi himself was involved in implementing multiple softforks where previously valid transaction formats / scripts no longer would be permitted in new blocks (most of them had never happened at the point the forks was implemented, though, which in those cases saves us from encoding the old validation rules next to the new ones). 
Since the network adopted the updates, anybody running on the old versions trying to make such transactions would be ignored. 
What's left? Arguments against hardforks? Satoshi knew removing the 1MB cap would be a hardfork and yet he said the limit was only meant to be *temporary*, to curb spam. Future solutions were anticipated to solve that problem.

I'd say it increases with how many sides it has. Because you need to make a multiple of the number of sides in throws to see that the distribution of the outcomes is even. You don't want any one number to be more than 1.5-2x common than any other after the throws (most throws will not end up with all numbers occuring equally, this is a statistical fact because those outcomes are a small number of all the possible outcomes).
Also, with a hexadecimal dice (16 sides) the probabilities of any one given number not showing up/showing up after N throws is 1-(1-1/16)^N and (1-1/16)^N respectively.
1 throw = 93.75% / 6.25%, 40 throws = 7.57% / 92.43% (1/0,0757 = 1 in 13 times you make 40 throws the side you picked won't show).
You should also take note of which numbers are grouped together. If some numbers are more common it might seem like a fluke, but if they're close it probably isn't.

And if the miners always go for the fork with the most stake currently, you can essentially doublespend quite cheaply by always mining on a fork with your second transaction to rapidly get all other miners to pick that fork, right after a new block has been released when not much stake has accumulated yet on any fork.

The common sentiment among the supporters is that there are too many who wants Bitcoin to succeed.
An attacker will be unlikely to be able to hide all their mining hardware (could result in physical counterattacks including sabotage), the defenders would likely reactivate old miners who have become unprofitable just to boost the honest mining power, hardware manufacturers might respond with instantly manufacturing large amounts of miners to counter the attack if deemed necessary (which means an attacker must keep up hardware production faster than all defenders), large companies that relies on Bitcoin in one way or another might subsidize the defenders through paying for production of new miners, etc...

You should be aware your instructions also might be guessable. The entropy of passwords are measured in how many attempts it would take on average given all public information to guess the password. Let's say for example a computer vision program could identify everything on that picture and ran scripts testing every combination that has been encountered previously, how long would it take to guess? 
If the instructions are too simple or short, it can be cracked. 
Also, humans are a bad source of randomness.

There's a bit more properties that an ideal proof-of-work algorithm "should" have (such as no shortcuts, not reusable), but those are among the most important ones.
At best there could be some kind of zero-knowledge proofs that also could prove the amount of computational power that was spend on the problem, but you still have the problem that both the input and output will be quite large for most problems, that it isn't certain that the output even will be useful, and that it's hard to even agree on what to process.
And then there's the overhead of generating zero-knowledge proofs.

@_date: 2015-05-14 10:41:19
Yes, with the ECDSA combinatorial threshold signature method it can be done. Don't know if P2SH alone can. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:42:23
Your Bitcoins are accessible from any computer that have the private keys tied to those addresses. You can have the same private keys on several computers. That's why you need to keep them secure against theft as well as to back them up to prevent loss from destruction or losing the copies. 
Using Electrum is the easiest way, as you only need to copy over the 12 word seed (it is deterministic, so both copies of Electrum will generate the same set of private keys and addresses). 
Another option is Armory (also deterministic), which requires a copy of Bitcoin Core to spend (it relies om Bitcoin Core to sync the blockchain). 
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:04:40
Because it's not at the moment you started spending that there was a 10% inflation, it's after you've spent them that there's 10% inflation. If you had been paid with existing money, you would have paid the same but the prices wouldn't have gone up for everybody else as the supply would be the same.
It becomes even more clear if you blow up the proportions - if there's 1000 coins and you get 1000 new coins, you can go on a huge spending spree, and then those who already had coins will see the prices jump and the value of their coins drop. But you probably didn't see prices rise until you've spent the majority of your coins already.

There was more than one of those. 
You know some of these people had to fight for it, because it was refused at first? 
It is easier to add further protections to Bitcoin, because there's no legacy systems designed in the 70's you're forced to be compatible with, etc. The problem with many bank security measures is that there by design are too many ways to circumvent them.
With Bitcoin you can have 2-of-2 multisig with a hardware wallet with an address book system and a service like Greenaddress.it with fraud detection like regular banks have. And unlike with banks, social engineering against the service can't work. You can't abuse 2FA against it. You can't use the address to order online. Etc... All the protections banks have can be recreated, *better*.

1: They aren't. Apple Pay is interfacing with Visas and Mastercards paypass and paywave. It isn't really a wallet, just a way to access your existing credit cards for payments. The current architecture isn't capable of handling person-to-person payments, and sucks for business-to-business. It would need something completely different to be able to handle payments between people and things like that. 
2: It has a large coordinated marketing campaign behind it from a globally known and admired consumer electronics company. 
3: Bitcoin don't need that to succeed. It had advantages that no other system can match (no third party trust required, scripting features) and a slow growth isn't a problem.

Weaknesses: stake can be reused infinitely in any number of forks. 
There are no reliable way to achieve concensus when there are a large number of forks. 
Attackers can reuse old sold coins by excluding the transaction that sold them in their alternate chain, drastically reducing the cost of attack. 
Also, the proof-of-work mining process has no impact on the transaction verification and thus no effect on the number of transactions.

If block size is forever kept down, Bitcoin will eventually be abandoned for being useless. The real solution is technology like Zero-knowledge proofs and other such compact correctness proofs.

Actually, we could implement the Fawkes signature scheme to recover from this, by posting a hash commitment using a secure hash function of the transaction before the transaction is posted, because the private key can't broken until the public key has been published.

Using Bluetooth to establish connections alone just isn't secure, because there's no way to guarantee who you're talking to. Regular BLE chips just don't have that capability, they aren't built like GPS. What iBeacon does isn't secure enough for payments.

Sorry but none of those are somehow the only possible self consistent assumptions. Both your  and  can be incredibly complex in some cases where there are no obvious right choice (several people unknowingly contributed to something that became valuable - how do you split the value? Two people get into conflict because of misunderstandings and external events outside their control, how do you determine who is more right? Somebody takes a highly risky action that can harm me but insist it isn't risky and that I have no right to stop him - how do you handle preemptive action? Etc...).
Not to mention the classification for what entities count as people with rights - is it based on intellectual capacity (excludes small kids, learning disabilities? Intellectual potential (excludes severe learning disabilities)? Average intelligence of your species (excludes highly intelligent beings from otherwise dumb species)? 
You can trivially ditch both for "we are just all lumps of particles, nothing objectively matter" and go without rules or judgements. Then you have zero logical conflict (there exist other "axioms" without conflict which you can make too). Don't like that? Then you can make rules with subjective valuation and preference behind it. Which is what you have done when backing those two rules.

He doesn't know how Gresham's law actually work. Really. "Bad" and "good" have clear objective definitions, and for anybody who have actually read about it, it is clear that the currency which losses value faster gets spent. Just look at South America which Gresham did, they're hoarding dollars because the local currency *inflate* faster than dollars, and so they spend their local currency. 
And dollars inflate faster than Bitcoin, so guess which will be hoarded and which will be spent.
But that guy straight up ignored the purpose of the terminology and made up his own interpretation. He replaced the meanings of the words with his own subjective interpretation in order to change the meaning of the statement of Gresham's law.

Why use a centralized service for that when you don't need to? 
Passively running a bitcoind node and a P2Pool node and a scheduled script that keeps sending small donations will work. 
Can somebody else write such a script to make it super-simple? Pretty please? :) 
Edit: As I commented below, an option for those who don't want to maintain a node; A number of separately trusted individuals could create a P2SH multisignature address you can donate to, where these keyholders pledge to only donate those coins to P2Pool and not do anything else with them. They would then have to sign the P2Pool donation transactions together. 
This way you keep some level of security while making it much simpler.

You need to read up a  it more on Zero-knowledge proofs.

The software managing the mining can easily be run virtualized (software like cgminer) as long as it has a communication channel to the ASIC hardware. Note that most of them are using simple USB, though, so the mining software would usually need a virtual USB driver that you can link to the ASIC hardwares' USB cables (like using USB over ethernet protocols). I think some ASIC:s supports ethernet directly too, but far from all of them do.

Tahoe-LAFS on I2P behaves like Freenet. You could easily implement something like Blockchain.info over that today. Any wallet where the server is untrusted and the critical parts are done in javascript can work over it.

*Somebody* needs to verify them, but all the miners need is an assurance the transactions have been verified. Simply getting the same Merkle tree hash from 3-4 entities they trust works over Morse code and is all they need. But attacking entities who is gathering transactions is completely useless in itself. Think of it a as a two-layered garlic where only one or two nodes in each layer needs to stay up. And the miners can be practically invisible on the network level (thus insanely hard to attack), while the entities gathering transactions can count in the tens of thousands.

Create the transaction but keep it secret, hash it, publish the hash to the Bitcoin blockchain, then when it's a few blocks back you publish your transaction.
Because before you published the hash nobody else knew the public key, so you had to have already known the private key without being able to get it through the exploit, and thanks to the published hash you can prove your specific transaction was the first one made using that key.

Stealth addresses already use Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman to generate the second keypair and address. It is a three-step process - public key is published, you run ECDH with your keypair and that public key, you send a message using that generated shared key (in this case you also use EC multiply with the public key of the recipient to create that second keypair). 
Also, any secure messenger like textsecure is sufficient together with stealth addresses.

I suggest using Diceware with 8-9 words for your password. Do not forget it! You should test the backup process several times with an empty wallet before you do it with your real wallet, so you learn the process. 
You can write down the password IF you have a safe place to put it, and do not EVER put it together with the wallet. Another option that is more secure is Shamir's Secure Sharing Scheme, implemented by Passguardian, so you can split your password in several pieces, that you store in different places.

If every move must be committed on a blockchain you can make it secure. At worst you can drop it, forcing a timeout that triggers certain rules for paying out the game funds (undo all deposits, or something else of your choice). 
You could play provably secure chess on the Bitcoin blockchain. But yes, that would be absurdly slow.

I mean how would the setup for that be easier. 
Setup for Bitcoin is install wallet, open to copy address, buy from somewhere (here in Sweden you can do this in 10 minutes start to finish with Safello) to get your coins. Pay by scanning code, enter password if you've set one, click ok. 
Credit card: paperwork, wait for approval. Install that phone app, link to your card with whatever security measures required by your bank (security codes, security token codes, or whatever else it might be). Then pay by scanning code, entering password or what else is required and click ok. 
PayPal: only fast signup if you've got CC, and even then you have to make a test payment first to be able to use all of their features later. Install phone app and log in. Pay by scanning code, enter password, click ok. 
Bitcoin has the fastest time for start to finish for somebody needing to make a payment.

This will take quite a while.

I've got one idea that limits the physical area needed: blink pattern based on the data to compare. The key to making it usable and actually comparable is to display the exact same pattern perfectly synchronized on two (or more) displays.
You hold them edge to edge, and make sure they're identical. 
What kind of geometric patterns do your screen have? It doesn't look like square grid pixels. But even with numeric grid you have 1 bit per visual block, and using the row closest to the edge with something like 4 groups of number grids then you have 7\*4 = 28 bits per frame. 5 frames gives 28\*5 = 120 bits.
Note that due to human visual bias, you can't just display the binary version of the address this way, lots of combinations would be easy to confuse with each other. Key expansion with a hash function would give you more unique bits to compare, like doing HMAC with different numbers as keys, so with HMAC-SHA1 (still secure for this use, yes) you get 160 bits to compare per HMAC key. So computing HMAC(address + amount, iteration number) for 10 iterations give you 1600 bits to compare. This means that if the user looks for long enough, he WILL be able to identify mismatches. 
You only need for approximately 100+ pairs of bits to be identical to ensure bruteforce is unachievable.

A Bitcoin that becomes unusable due to capacity problems will eventually get rejected and forgotten.
The only probable solution in the spirit of what you suggest is a softforked "segwit / sidechain like" Zero-knowledge proof based UTXO set commitment scheme.

For soft forks (policy adjustment), miner majority determines the outcome. 
For hard forks, economic majority does (the miners mine where there's the most users, the rest follow). This means the users select a client compatible with one fork or the other.

The problem is that they *shouldn't*.
IMHO the real problem is the difficulty of deploying secure sandboxed apps that can be automatically synced between your devices. Web apps is a tempting solution, but the attack surface is too large IMHO.
Java has been common too, but even that has cross-platform issues and frequent security holes.
I think that Google's PNaCl runtime with a data syncing engine and maybe a Qt based cross-platform UX library could work. Then it would just be a matter of a few clicks to get the same app working on all your devices in a secure manner.

DNS seems to be inherently hard if the entire class of nodes which needs to process and relay it in cleartext at some point is all agreeing on blocking it. 
The problem is that anything where the name lookup must resolve the same data for everybody, those same nodes can always detect the presence of that entry. So you need a name that's appears innocent enough to not be filtered, and the entry for it must point to some place which they can not censor (DHT?) to censoring of updates from having any effect. 
The other option is something coinjoin like in that a larger number of registrations is merged using something like Secure Multiparty Computation so that censoring becomes socially / politically costly. 
A completely different option is private namespaces - in one way, Zerocoin's Zero-knowledge proofs of one time use of deposit tokens is similar to a private DNS namespace. If your namespace is encrypted, Zero-knowledge proofs show the miners that the entries are valid, but to know the contents you need the key. Then they must censor entire namespaces, unless you manage to hide even that in your encrypted updates and preserve enough efficiency in the data structure.

There's no reason for me to accept anything from any other ledger than that of Bitcoin unless that cryptocurrency would have features that Bitcoin can't compete against, allowing it to gain momentum against Bitcoin.

It is more correct to say that the cost to mine gold CAPS its value, not determines it.
Something expensive to mine can cost less on the market than what it cost to mine it because demand is low, and if it costs more on the market than mining the same amount does, then mining will be incentivized until the cost to mine more of it matches the market price.

Here's one theory which at least is self consistent, but with so insane implications most scientists think it is too extreme:
You've heard of the multiverse theories? Every single possibility actually happens in one universe, the time line is a time tree essentially. 
But it gets worse - to make these quantum effects work the way they do, you need to have two parallel universe bubbles be created and expand with the speed of light from the particle every time an interaction COULD have happened, and every time two uncorrellated bubbles overlap their number of universes MULTIPLIES which each other in the overlapping field (A or B and X or Y becomes A/X, A/Y, B/X, B/Y). Oh, and that was when there's only 2 possible outcomes such as spin left or spin right, with more possible outcomes you get more bubbles. 
And when the bubbles from two entangled particles overlap, THEN they don't multiply straight off, instead you get A/Y and B/X as the entanglement prevents A/X and B/Y from happening. 
Merely the presence of a grain of sand would necessarily cause trillions of parallel universes to be created every picosecond. There really is that many potential interactions in such small spaces at so small timescales! 
Now contemplate the principle of conservation of matter and energy in that multiverse. What powers the creation of those bubbles, the forking of universes? How many can there be? What kind of space do THEY exist in? How do they interact? How do entanglement gets it special treatment, what's the mechanism of communication, what information does the edge of that bubble carry? How can all that information be stored, if you look at it from a computational standpoint, how do they fit physically into the structure they exist in?
And that's not even the most insane part. You know what irrational numbers are? Numbers like Pi, there's no last digit, they never end. Now, what if a certain outcome has a probability with an irrational number - all those parallel universes must be created in correct proportions to show the properties we measure, but EXACTLY HOW MANY universes are created with irrational probabilities? Infinitely many!? The universe don't seem to perform rounding of the numbers!
Not to mention, we haven't even determined exactly what's a potential interaction. At what timescale do they happen if you have two particles which MIGHT interact in between time A and time B, as with random decay? Is there a minimum Plank time limit, or is this infinite too? How many physical points can they interact at, is it infinite again or limited by some Plank scale grid of positions?

I've yet to see a card that don't even have yearly costs or overage charges. 
Making a call is still more effort. Waiting for it is still slower. 
That payment is made via Sepa internationally or bankgiro within Sweden, both have message fields for telling the recipient what the payment covers. That's just a matter of copy-paste. 
Most companies don't take bank payments directly, so no. Not all people have CC, again, so their options for online payments is limited. 
If you have no back account, localbitcoins.com is still faster than signing up for a bank and depositing cash. 
Collectibles and other such unique items, adult items, gambling (not that I like gambling, but it remains legal), and many niches. They're hit by chargebacks more often than the rest, and at often denied the option to use payment processors. You can't point to the same PayPal that rejected their applications! 
And making Bitcoin payments is hard to you...? 
Smart compression techniques, Zero-knowledge proofs for UTXO indexes, self-verifying data structures of various kinds (a middle road between SPV and UTXO sets with ZKP's), IBLT, checkpoints that merge large sets of transactions using ZKP's, etc...

Your U2F dongle has an encrypted end-to-end connection of its own to the server.
If the phisher pretends to be service X they can't decrypt the response, so they can't use it. Forwarding the encrypted response will fail if they try to reuse it when logging in, because when THEY try to log in later the challenge sent to them will be different.
They can only tunnel it, but since everything is encrypted with keys they don't have they can't inject traffic or otherwise hijack the connection. Whatever they try to do, the device will only make a response to service X if received over an encrypted channel, so they can't strip the encryption down to plain HTTP. The authentication step in the encryption means the phisher can't change anything. The device just don't respond to challenges from service X unless delivered via an authenticated encrypted channel. 
And technically it is two channels - SSL in the browser, and another layer in top in between the server and dongle. Both those channels is verified in advance. The browser then reuses that SSL channel. The U2F response also can not be reused outside that SSL connection, which also stops browser malware from being able to permanently take over an account, it can ONLY control the current session. Once you close it, the malware gets cut off entirely. 
If they don't pretend to be them but uses a similar name, they'll get a response that isn't valid for use with service X.

Because *some* number has to be chosen, it's just an arbitary number that the creator liked.
The creator chose to have blocks generated every 10 minutes on average, and that it starts with 50 coins generated per block, and after every 210'000 blocks the payout for mining halves.
The combination of those numbers leads to the cap of 21 million coins - 50\*210'000 + 50/2\*210'000 + 50/4\*210'000 ... = 21 million. But more precisely, given that Bitcoin is limited to 8 decimals, it stops at 20'999'999.9769 bitcoins (you can't have less than a satoshi as a mining reward).
The reason for a cap is that the creator wanted to mimic gold, he wanted provable scarcity and no risk of hyperinflation.

I remember how I anticipated touchscreen smartphones would eventually dominate as soon as I first saw a Sony Ericsson P800 (or P810i?). Think it was 2003-2004. I'm a 90's kid. Universal computing devices with Internet and GPS wherever you go, and interfaces that can be customized from the ground up for every single app as necessary. Why use a fixed button layout for such a small device when you can have the exact amount you need, no more or less, and any layout you like? Why navigate only by button press when you can scroll and quickly tap buttons and elements with your finger? Always updated maps in high resolution, full Internet browser, fast communication and much more. 
Nobody used to care, and some questioned how that could be useful, but now smartphones are all over the place.

The entire assumption is wrong. You can't just assign the whole subsidy as a fee to pay for the transactions, that doesn't make sense. Does the fee then drop if transaction count goes up? Why would it do that if the fee ever was tied to the number of transactions? Since it is static, there's no logically consistent way to claim that it represents a cost for the transactions in the network. The "cost" per transactions is INVERSELY linear to the number of transactions, which is the total opposite of how fees normally work.
Removing the whole subsidy would NOT make it impossible to process the same amount of transactions, in fact it is paid out voluntarily by the network as a whole to the miners as a part of agreeing to follow the protocol to incentivize them to secure the network. Since it literally has NO connection to the number of transactions, that subsidy could be of ANY size and the network would work the same. 
The only difference would be that the miners would adjust how much they spend on their mining hardware to maximize profits, given their current income from mining vs their electricity costs.

Do you know how much data you can encode in a single photon? Virtually unlimited amounts. The antennas is what sets the limit. Noise and antenna engineering limitations does reduce what you can transmit practically, but there's no mathematically proven hard limits for throughput (by that I don't mean what you can send in a limited channel, but by what a channel actually can be capable of - the methods I mentioned improves channel capacity).

The U2F standard will not require external hardware. Local software and a smartphone app will work as well. A physical token is just more resistant to attack.
Also, U2F completely blocks MITM through stripping encryption (sslstrip) and similar attacks, the various forms of OTP does not. And entering it on the wrong site once will give them at least temporary access, which can be bad enough. OTP is secure if you manually check you're in the right site with encryption on.
Also, U2F tokens seamlessly work for an endless number of services, unlike classic symmetric key OTP tokens. This is incredibly important, setup across multiple services is trivial.

So you acknowledge that your morally absolute system will have arbitary outcomes when implemented? 
But what if there were non-absolute systems that on average had outcomes that were more globally optimal (game theory term) than those from your system? Would it be moral to enforce that your system should be followed then? 
Not to mention that determining what happened isn't even the hardest part, defining what happened even when you know the movement of every single particle involved is still hard. Was it REALLY murder? Was there intent? Was it a spasm? Was it an accident? Was he really the one who caused the death, or would it have occurred otherwise as well?

Nothing. There's no encryption involved. Cryptography includes signatures, encryption, key exchange and much more. 
RSA might use the same math for decryption as for signing and same math for verification as for encryption - but Bitcoin uses ECC, not RSA. You take the private key and plaintext and run ECC signing math, and out comes a random looking blob. And in most ECC types you can actually derive the public key from the plaintext + the signature, which is HOW you confirm that the signature was created using that keypair.

In which case people can and will exercise the option to reject your set of axioms on the ground that you can't prove them to be tied to the physical world we live in (unlike for axioms about flat versus curved space geometry) and choose other axioms to go by.

What's the problem?
**Each transaction should have a deterministic effect on your index** and should all be individually reversible (reorganizations is to rebuild your index *partially*). At most you need to look up older UTXO's to recover lost state. Everything is in the blockchain! 
When you have an index up to block X, identifying the removed transactions in X as compared to Y and reversing their effect from your index to then add the effect from the new ones in Y shouldn't be hard (although it might be tedious). 
You simply see that transactions XYZ now are gone, so you reverse them in the index (looking up their parent transactions to restore that previous state, removing the UTXO's they added from the UTXO set), then you see ABC was added and you enter them in the index. This works because transactions are atomic, they happen all at once or they don't happen at all, no conflicts allowed. 
All outputs and inputs are uniquely identified through hashes, there can't be a transaction in Y identical to one in X which also depend on another transaction NOT found in X (malleability attacks changes the UTXO hash). New transactions are all straight descendants of one or more earlier transactions in the blockchain (except coinbase transactions, which there only is one of per block). 
**The blockchain dictates a particular order of transactions, that's the primary purpose, to declare the official order of events**. Wall clock time is irrelevant. 
If a transaction is in both X and Y, they MUST have all the same identical parents. If they are in conflict (spending the same UTXO but are different), their descendants CAN NOT have identical hashes and will therefore not ever go undetected. A simple diff WILL reveal all differences. Any transaction changed means all the ones depending on it gets removed from the index, followed by the new ones being introduced.

They haven't. Their authentication mechanism is both per-session (not per user pair) and vulnerable to undetectable (in all standard clients) 2^64 bruteforce. This is due to only 64 bits actually being used for the comparison. 
You can MITM it if you can get both targets to initiate chats and you're in between them on the network level and can perform 2^64 computations (can be outsourced for relatively small sums).
With a router exploit (very common, often exploitable via the web browser if the target via XSS), MITM like that is easy to achieve. On open WiFi it is trivial. NSA can do it to just about anybody in the open Internet. Getting both parties to initiate chats is just a waiting game.

It can. Cryptographically based routing algorithms like that which CJDNS uses proves it.
The only centralized part not that can't really be decentralized without a technological makeover is IP assignment. Just like Bitcoin and I2P and Tor, CJDNS uses hashes of public keys as addresses, but they use it specifically in IPv6 format in the private fc:: range.
You can build a separate Internet today with it. Just establish physical links between all the nodes and configure them to connect to each other. Done, and you've got secure routing with an encrypted connection. The only thing that could stop you from making it global is your resources.

Yes, the hashrate would go down. What the subsidy pays for is for the miners to secure the network, not the individual transactions themselves.
The cost to attack the network roughly matches the size of the mining subsidy + fees because that's approximately what miners will spend in total on their mining hardware and operational costs.
Lowering the total payout thus lowers the costs for performing a 51% attack.
The idea is that eventually the sheer number of transactions will allow for fairly low individual transaction fees that still can pay as much as the network as a whole determines is needed to make an attack too costly to perform. If an attacker could spend a million dollars over a year, the mining reward for that time period should be just above that, which would be split out over all transactions in that time period, to make sure that the attacker can't succeed.

It isn't just semantic if it alters the logic. Would you prefer a kilogram of gold or a liter of water right now? 
But what if you had been a week in a desert and was out of water, THEN what would you prefer? 
Can the inherent value change because of external context? That shouldn't be possible if it really was inherent, right?
To say "the inherent value didn't change, another component of value (value from necessity, etc) changed" would be the same as defining the inherent value as zero because there are NO context in which what you'd call inherent value dominates in determining the relative value against what you are comparing it with.

It is medium-term disruptive and long-term unsustainable. The only long-term sustainable outcome is *intermittent* selfish-mining by the various pools, which ends quickly.
Anything else would turn into an arms race which essentially means all pools smaller than the largest pool gives away their influence to the largest pool by not cooperating, giving the biggest pool 51%-capability. Only 3x 33.3% pools doing selfish mining could be medium-term stable (in which case none of them makes any additional profit), anything else collapses in mere days or hours. And because doing this would hurt trust on the market and drop the price, everybody is incentivized to NOT even try doing it.

Best case scenario: all people in the world would have their identities registered in the blockchain.
All financial interactions (no exceptions) would by law require that the recipient of the payment provide a Zero-knowledge proof against the blockchain that they have the right to request a payment to the provided address. If they have an obligation to send all payments via a smart contract (such as defaulting on a loan and going into personal bankruptcy, or due to personal IPO like you suggest, etc) then they can't create a valid ZKP for a secondary address. Only the smart contract address would allow for a valid ZKP to be created. 
Violating this would get both parties to a transaction punished (the recipient for violating the contract, the payer for knowingly making payment to an address not proven valid) - if detected!

Safello requires no bank info for buying. Just make a payment to their bank account with the payment message they gave you. Your Bitcoins is in your wallet as soon as the bank transfer is complete. You can also sign up for Swish with a number of Swedish banks to do it, with a similar payment process, but far shorter waiting time for the payment to go through. 
Localbitcoins.com can be safe too if you are careful.

You earn Bitcoins proportionally to the **fraction of the total hash rate** your own mining power represents. 
Decrease the total and your fraction goes up. 
For solo mining that also means higher probability per block of being the one to mine it (for example 1/100 to 1/50).
Every hash is equal, but you're competing against fewer of them. In particular after difficulty adjustment!

No, it was always proof of work to establish a shared blockchain, with Satoshi acknowledging from the start that miners and full nodes likely would eventually run in datacenters.
And the SPV (simplified payment verification) protocol would protect the users against most of the risks with that setup, while also still enforcing protocol rules. 
Miners done chose what protocol the users will follow. Users chooses what protocol to follow, miners mine one those that are profitable.

That the backend tracks the payment through holding actual signed Bitcoin transactions that represents the final result of all the transfers, coinjoin style.

Fawkes signatures, a.k.a. timestamped commitment schemes. 
You publish a hash of your transaction to the blockchain before you publish the transaction itself.
Hash functions are much harder to break, so they can't create a valid transaction that had a commitment in the blockchain that is older. This is secure against somebody who can break the ECDSA public key but not the hash, as only the original owner could have created a valid signature while the public key itself remained unknown to the world. So this works if your public key is unknown, which means addresses you've only received coins at but not spent from is secure.

Late reply, but whatever...


Sometimes it actually is. Had a card at some place I rarely used, and after a while the fees got my balance there into negative = more fees. And you know what the worst thing is? They waited 2 months before telling me and THEN they charged me extra fees for being late with the payment! So I got pissed and cancelled that card right away. Any fee for anything I'm not using actively = no-go.


Not where I live at least, with Safello it is trivial.


Only if you chose to use scammy services.


No they don't. Unless you're talking auction houses and stuff like that, which isn't what I was talking about.


Yes, they reduce what all the nodes have to store to make the system work securely.


Multisignature notaries, like greenaddress.it and bitgo. Instant verification as you trust those companies *until the transaction is verified in a block* to not sign conflicting transactions. Since they always sign with the same keys it is trivial to prove if they acted maliciously and signed two conflicting transactions spending the same UTXO (unspent bitcoin entry in the blockchain). Since it is unprofitable to doublespend for them (all trust vanishes instantly), and since it is trivial to prove and thus take them to court over it, they will make sure it doesn't happen.
"But isn't that like Ripple, why do we need a blockchain then?" - simply because this setup reduces the time period you have to trust them for to 10 minutes on average per transaction (or an hour for larger transactions), and outside of that you need ZERO trust in them. A Ripple style network based on this requires that they are watched and scrutinized and audited constantly and they can break your trust at any point in time and screw you over, and they can rewind the transaction history at-will if you trust one of them alone. The combination above with blockchain + multisignature notary is the best one available that provides both speed and security.


For transaction processing they literally could. It would be slow at peak loads, but would still work.

Either you contribute to the market and create value (which is how the deflation is fueled in the first place, more goods and services competing for the same money!), or your hoarded funds will need to be spent to keep your company alive, redistributing it in the economy. 
If everybody hoards, there's also almost nothing in offer in the market, and there's no growing basis for the value in the economy, so the value of the money can't grow so the deflation can't continue. Why would people increasingly want to get a share of the pool of money if there's no use for it?

The IBLT will tell you the exact difference between Y and X so you DO NOT need to reverse X in full, and you ONLY need to reverse those transactions which were exclusive to X (the coinbase transaction and potentially a few others), and then add in the effect of those unique to Y (the new coinbase transaction and maybe a few others). 
Then you proceed to the next block Z for processing.

Compressed transaction bundles (created by payment processors and similar entities) with Zero-knowledge proofs of validity, plus blockchain checkpoints with Zero-knowledge proofs of validity generated daily.

CPU load would even decrease for end users thanks to ZKP, although it would increase for those generating these proofs.

Late reply, but whatever:
1: Not every detail in there, but good enough: 
2: Recurring payments with Bitcoin require a piece of internet connected hardware that's constantly up and running. Initiating a subscription would be done with BIP70, the server would say over that connection "this is a subscription, send me X worth of bitcoins every Y time unit for delivery of service Z". Your wallet software would arrange for that to be done if possible (or otherwise tell you "you don't yet have any arrengement for supporting recurring payments yet, set it up now?"). 
Both parties would have a reciept of the transaction details for what was agreed on, signed by both parties. If both parties agreed, a multisignature escrow / arbitrator would be used for the actual payment (look at bitrated.com and similar services) so that the buyer has the option to request his money back in case the merchant don't deliver what was promised.
There is tons of middlemen and intermediaries and old mainframes with ancient software and regulations covering systems built on trust that simply *vanishes* when doing it this way.


You're wrong because it isn't per-transaction. It would actually be more accurate to say it is INVERSELY per-transaction because you would have to divide the amount of computing power with the number of transactions to calculate the split, which means more transactions = less per transaction.

Uhm, yes, the contract still must cover at least CC fees because they're still applicable when used for payments. 
Safello don't require making a payment to get verified, that's PayPal. Safello requires a payment upfront to buy Bitcoins, the end. Sign up, enter name and basic details, make bank payment or Swish payment, done. Then you just wait for the Bitcoins to get sent to your address when Safello has confirmed the payment. That's less work than getting the bank to send me a CC card.
There's tons of legal businesses who gets systematically rejected by payment companies and who get chargebacks far more often than average who finds it useful. There's online only business who finds it useful. There's international businesses who finds it useful.

It creates IPv6 addresses based on public keys, the nodes then share details about what other nodes they're connected to in order to build a network map, then when you want to connect to another node you send a request that only that node can create a valid signed response to and the network forwards that request along a route between the nodes that was calculated.

@_date: 2015-01-30 12:51:01
Bitcoin is the combination of a shared database / ledger of who owns how many tokens (named the blockchain) and a protocol for how to update it.
The protocol sets a limit to how many tokens there can be and sets a limit to the rate of creation of new tokens. This means the tokens are scarce / limited. 
The basic task of the Bitcoin network is to track assignments of control (usually as a result of change in ownership) of those tokens, and allow people to easily and securely transfer control.
The transfer mechanism uses digital signatures to prove that the person in control of the tokens (as they hold the private keys) have approved of transferring the control.
Bitcoin transactions are essentially signed statements that say "move token X from Alice to Bob" followed by the signature that was generated with the private key that belongs to Alice. 
If they want to know about mining:
The purpose of it is to manage to prove to the world that you have spent some resources that are scarce (limited in the real world) in order to vouch for a particular version of the database, to say "this should be the newest version of the blockchain". This way you can decide on a winning version of events everybody will agree on, as everybody can see that one version really is vouched for by the most people. 
This process is done block by block, therefore it is called the blockchain since every new block links to the previous one. The resource they spend is computing power, by taking their own version of the blockchain and calculating numbers (hashes) to find ones with properties that are rare (mining difficulty). 
The mechanism that decides which version wins is a form of mathematical lottery. The first one to find a number with the right properties can tell the world about it (wrong numbers will go ignored). He have then added to the chain. Everybody now starts using his version of the blockchain to continue the same process of finding rare numbers. 
Since the numbers allow you to estimate the amount of computing power was spent to generate them, you can estimate which blockchain version has the most computing power (scarce resource) behind it. That one wins, and because everybody will come to the same conclusion you have a global concensus.

Because math. You run thousands of inputs through it and run the same inputs into other software of the same kind and compare, *if they disagree then one must be wrong* and you have to redo the math to tell which is right and which is wrong and why.
By having thousands of test cases with known right outputs to compare with, entire classes of errors can be automatically detected.
You create many of them by entering random numbers and running the math multiple times to find the correct answer, then your test case provides the same inputs and look for those outputs. In many cases you look at the formulas themselves and try to identify edge cases and manually construct inputs testing them. Many can be created by software for you if your definitions are sufficiently unambiguous.

Do you call that an axiom? That's pretty worthless as far as axioms go because of the ambiguity.
You simply can not define any meaningful absolutes regarding what humans may and may not do if your intent is to minimize suffering and restrictions on individuals, because you need a perfect model of the world first to begin with if you don't want to be caught by surprise where you encounter situations in which what you banned is the best choice by every conceivable metric.
And even if you do have a perfect model, do you have perfect definitions of what every action and situation and object and entity IS? The fact that there's open problems in math is to large part the result of it being unbelievably hard to DEFINE what the essence of the problem really is. Mathematical proofs are themselves in essence just very verbose definitions, they say one thing equals (or don't equal) another.
If you want to be pragmatic, at best you can follow principles designed to be consistent and efficient.

It would be possible to have a wallet that analyze your usage trends and only auto-locks the sums you're likely to spend during the next few days, and which also can request for the other party to sign a transaction releasing the funds, when necessary, with a single click from your side.

By the way, can you reverse the usage of BLE and NFC in that charging device, i.e. can you let devices with BLE use it as a proxy for the NFC reader? So that my tablet which don't have NFC but do have BLE could talk to NFC devices via it? Are both those radios connected to a shared microcontroller powerful enough to act as a proxy? 
One of the neat things that would enable would also be to have your mobile device in your pocket and still use the NFC host emulation mode to let you use your phone as an NFC tag via that device. So if you have an app that can unlock NFC equipped locks, this device would let you keep your phone in the pocket while doing it.

The proof-of-reserves schemes for Bitcoin are clever and would help a lot. Enterprise grade Bitcoin HD wallets with this built in plus logging of all transaction data into a Factom-like blockchain (essentially triple-entry accounting with all receipt data being untamperable) would make it way easier to audit businesses. Every outgoing transactions would require data on who the recipient is and the purpose and type, all incoming ones in HD branches for sales would require the relevant data from those systems (not sure on how to deal with unidentified transactions). All budgets would be completely transparent and any attempt to spend money without logging the necessary data would be a violation per the auditing rules. Bypassing the system would also be a violation (can't accept money outside it, etc). Every single Bitcoin (UTXO to be precise) would have its origin accounted for. 
Now that's just the Bitcoin related financials, though. There could still be fiat-denominated debts not logged in the ledgers.

Network effects will keep most altcoins from even getting close to Bitcoin in usage. It is like how there's just one email protocol in wide use, one global phone network with its associated assigned phone number ranges, etc. You don't ask what phone network they are on to be able to call them. You just call.

Wrong. There's no encryption. Encryption is to scramble to make something unreadable, signatures proves integrity and authencity of a message. There's no scrambling involved to create most types of signatures. Cryptography and encryption is not the same. Encryption is one type of cryptography the same way cars is just one type of vehicle.

Chances are they're testing it. Doesn't have to mean they're planning to accept it, but given how little work Bitcoin takes compared to most other payment systems they'd be crazy to not be prepared if they would change their minds. The R&amp;D departments in most companies are already testing tons of things they aren't planning to release in the first place, this isn't very different. You always want somebody in your company to have a clue about anything that might end up becoming the next big thing.
Even if it's just two-three people spending a week or two on it, with Bitcoin that still means they could end up just having to flip a switch to turn on support.

It does indeed have security audits (although not as many as Tor), the amount of routing nodes is larger which makes timing attacks harder, to a network level attacker it also gives you a larger effective anonymity set as it is harder to identify the source when the source itself is routing random traffic.

Lol no. There's no widely used asymmetric scheme were encryption is used to create the public key from a private key. Neither RSA or ECC (ECDSA) works that way.
While RSA allows you to use the encryption formula with the private key to sign and the decryption formula with the public key to verify, there's no data beyond the secret key actually kept secret. 
ECDSA don't even work that way at all.

With your way of using it, anybody who can access your seed will also be able to get your password. To actually ADD security, look into multisignature addresses. That way you can require the usage of several devices to get to the coins.

30 bits by going with EFF's panopticlick estimation? That means your precise setup must be one of the already known ones to test, otherwise I'd argue it will be over 30 bits. (Although in a *targeted* attack it would be worth 0 bits of entropy if they can get you to visit a site of theirs with the same browser.)
With a secure method of mixing in entropy, you will not lose anything at adding additional sources. Even if all the extra sources adds nothing, you still have at least as much entropy as your single strong source provided.
And of course stretching also helps, nothing stops you from doing both.

Describe your prototypes and show lots of pseudocode. Thus showing doesn't have inventive height, it isn't different enough from what have already been done. 
* with a lot of people showing very thorough analysis, you set the bar high for what an average person in the industry would come up with given a certain problem, thus setting an even higher bar for what it takes to come up with a solution that can be considered patentable. 
Also, even if you patent there's still absolutely nothing at all that stops others from patenting around your patent, or even mentioning your patent outright and saying "using patent X for Y". Patents can only exclude others from using your invention without permission, nothing more, they can't exclude others from coming up with other ideas for how to use it and patent those.

Why? RBF allows merging multiple transactions generated close together, saving fees. Like of you make multiple purchases and run it of confirmed UTXO's to spend. Just reuse the previous ones, simply move change coins to payments in an updated transaction version. And more.

If that's what you think, you really haven't been reading anything I write.
Unless of course your expect miners to blindly mine on all valid headers (SPV mining) like with the recent BIP shenanigans, at which point most miners no longer run their own full nodes, and thus can get orphaned if they mine on invalid blocks.
I'm by default assuming most people usually talk about miners + pools + full nodes when they talk about miners and centralization effects and miners deliberately creating larger blocks. In other words, the collection of hardware and their owners that decides what transactions to include in generated blocks.
And seriously, you aren't even trying to explain what you think I got wrong. You have no argument at all.

Not saying I want additional barriers. However, it shouldn't be easy to get away with deceptive practices, abuse, damaging the environment, etc. How that is implemented isn't as important to me. I don't like unnecessary restrictions either. 
You are making assumptions about what kind of spacetime bending machines might be invented. With a 3-dimensional space and restricted accessible volume and a given topology where certain arbitary areas are off limits, it will NOT always be easy to establish any kind of service that requires geographically interconnected infrastructure over a large area. 
Look up gridlock. *Refusing* coordination / cooperation can be more profitable than cooperating for individual landowners. When there's no incentive to cooperate, it won't happen. You are assuming all people owning large or strategically important resources will be cooperative. That just won't always be the case. 
When the other option to the monopolist requires too great momentum behind a single project which would take a long time and isn't certain to work, people tens to be lazy and settle with what they are currently offered. Most people won't suddenly start building a radio mesh network on their own to replace a broadband provider unless majorly pissed off for a long time, for example. Expensive long-term investments with limited benefits are avoided out of laziness, even if they would be slightly better over time. Unless everybody simultaneously goes for it and funds it together, it ain't happening. 
The reason some monopolies exist is because the technology required to be competitive with them doesn't exist yet. 
I would prefer more options based on voluntary cooperation, but I see far too many people who are entirely content with sabotaging other people's attempts to collaborate, or with behaving as a parasite. And unfortunately it isn't enough with just punishing infringement of others' rights after the fact. I have no idea how to most efficiently deal with those kind of people, but there simply needs to be some kind of proactive defense against such behavior. If you can find a better option that actually works, then show me. So far I haven't seen anything convincing.

You think you really can identify any one fake fork that easily? There's endless tactics one can employ when you have 51% stake to hide the origin. Network isolation and feeding fake information to others (which NSA is doing with their MITM injection attacks) can allow you to create dozens of seemingly equally valid forks which all are backed by approximately equal stake.
And once the other stake holders starts to use other means of communication (phone and whatever) and gather on one fork, you support another fork. All while pretending to be many people, not just one (employing a shill army to fake community support). And if you hack stake holders and get their keys, you own their stake too in a non-reversible manner, unlike hardware miners which stay put and can be restored.

That's it. 
This rewrite allows you to replace the choices of previous miners with your own;
* taking mining rewards for yourself
* removing payments you previously have made and replacing them with transactions to yourself (doublespends)
* temporarily censoring payments going to chosen targets (but you can't invalidate payments that others made in most circumstances (chained transactions can be exposed to malleability attacks, breaking the hash based reference to the claimed unspent transaction output - this requires that the secondary transactions are replaced by new versions by the same people who created the first versions)).
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:14:51

That subversion would be to fool the script engine. That happened and got fixed once in the past, somebody created billions of coins. That block got invalidated, and the script engine got fixed.

@_date: 2017-03-27 15:07:31
Miners can already do that with a soft cap, like they used to for years
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:22:49
If a block is so large that the propagation latency means other miners can't compete (they have to start their mining too late), then other full nodes will experience the same latency when trying to verify block contents and might even set as a policy to reject those large blocks. In fact, that's overwhelmingly likely. 
Other miners might even be the first to do so, meaning that any 51% mining majority that decides to softfork out block excessively large blocks will make that one miner's massive blocks worthless orphaned blocks. Cheered on by large merchants and transaction processors and more which wants to be able to process low blocks quickly. 
I bet it will eventually become miner policy to not tolerate blocks taking more than about 30 seconds to verify.

I'm assuming there's idle mining hardware (old and new) all over the place, which miners will be willing to activate to counter an attack. I'm assuming there's entities willing to fund mass production and deployment of mining hardware if necessary to counter a sudden attack. I'm assuming no entity will have direct control over the majority of mining hardware for a longer period of time (individual miners will rapidly leave malicious pools, production is distributed). I'm assuming such a large attack with private mining hardware will leave physical footprints, likely resulting in detection and counterattacks. I'm assuming hacking to control miners or pools will not give lasting control. Etc...

Yes, exactly. Proving my point for me. 
50 people doing that with you = 100 transactions. 
Then they do the same with their respective food shops, landlords, etc, making for several thousands of transactions per year per person. 
Or the majority of people use a single LN wallet with one of the LN servers available and only make 2 transactions each a year, instead of dozens or hundreds.

Yes, a lot of users favored XT. So why did it deserve stonewalling and malice? What was wrong with it? Strong support is pretty much the reason why cooperation should have been the answer. 
With nothing representing a real option, no way around the status quo, there would be literally no reason for the current group on power to acknowledge the existence of differing opinions. There's no negotiation when one party has no leverage and nothing to offer to the other. No discussion when the majority is allowed to ban discussions about whatever they don't like. 
The core developers barely acknowledged that blocks becoming full anytime soon could be a problem. With tons of people seeing full blocks as a threat and with literally no way at all to change their minds, how could you possibly force a discussion without using the one piece of leverage that existed, that of offering an alternative client together with the possibility/risk of the users moving from one to the other? Giving people what they want and a way to show support for another option. 
Responding to the formation of a distinct group with differing opinions with malice instead of discussion is exactly how you start a war.

So Bitcoin is becoming more niche. How's that helpful for decentralization? And you don't even know why they're buying it. In fact, they may be speculating that a future hard fork will solve the scaling problems. How would you how why they're buying it? And in fact you don't even really know if more people want it, or if there's just a few rich people buying. 


Majority agreement isn't that willy nilly 


Right, protocol versions don't exist. Like HTTP 1.1 and 2.0. Some are more different than their prior versions than others. 
Oh, and when was the last time you ran a version 0.1 Bitcoin Qt client? Because I'm pretty sure it literally can't even connect to the current network, nevertheless talk to modem nodes. Saying that only the blockchain syntax matters would IMHO be slightly preposterous. So then you're also NOT using Bitcoin. Why are you calling it Bitcoin then? You should be asking for a name change of the current system! 
Segwit requires client cooperation, in that it requires that they create transactions in a specific format. If they stick to the old format, then no savings are made = no scaling improvement. If half the clients change, only half the potential savings are achieved. 
I didn't say segwit is a sidechain. Just that the proof data is attached to the blockchain which is needed for full nodes. With ZKP based transactions merging (like LN on steroids), its transaction data would need to sit outside the original blockchain structure as well. The transactions to send to and from the main blockchain would also have to use anyone-can-spend transactions referencing the ZKP data with miner enforced compliance, still similar to segwit. 
You haven't really justified why not to fork. All you've really got is "some people don't want it". 
A hardfork gets everybody who wishes to stay to comply with the new rules. 
You're not forcing anything onto Bitcoin? All I'm trying to do is to advocate the change I believe is necessary, so that development can move in that direction and so that users will opt in. 
That's literally the opposite to forcing anything. 
I understand Bitcoin pretty well. And the scientific method too (which you didn't show when you ignored alternative reasons for why people might be buying). In fact I'm literally one of the first people who proposed using multisignature transactions with servers reduces to notaries using timelocked p2sh wallets, as a way to replace green addresses (trusted senders, for instant transactions). In fact, that's now a central part of Lightning Network (where they combine networked payment channels with timelocked multisignature wallets, wherein you commit funds to an LN wallet, which the LN servers can neither steal nor freeze). 
So I believe it is fair to say I've contributed a lot to Bitcoin already. 
Free transactions wasn't promised by most people. I definitely remember those days, and often corrected people on that point. The promises I talk about are the ones from when the whitepaper was released, and the early days of the network. Security, giving controls to the users. 
And now you seem to have changed your mind on why people invest, from liking the network as it is to buying into a lie. 
Logical consequence that it is set in stone? Pretty obviously not when being set in stone will kill it, because fees will rise until the only people who can afford it will realize Bitcoin has lost the network effect that made it useful in the first place. At which point it loses its value and tanks. 
Satoshi literally talked about nodes running in server halls. The very first whitepaper described Simplified Payment Verification mode (light wallets) with that in mind. 
So if you didn't know that in advance, then you screwed up. Not me.
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:15:22
Sorry for the late reply, but anyway... 
So you still think I'm advocating against Segwit? Where have I ever done that? Don't mix me up with your stereotypical BU supporter (I don't even care about BU). I'm just saying it's not enough. I'm not saying it's bad. 
Segwit is the pump that gets water out of the sinking boat. We need to fix the boat eventually. That WILL require incompatible changes in the block format some day. Bitcoin can't survive weeks worth of congestion / backlogs 24/7. 
Where did you see anybody talk about multisignature based instant transactions using timelocks to prevent both doublespends and frozen funds back in 2012? I'm seriously curious, because I've been looking and couldn't find any prior art to my own posts on it.

@_date: 2017-03-27 15:34:42
No because you can't prove that your interpretation is right. Satoshi envisioned an SPV mode protected with fraud proofs, something Zero-knowledge proofs can offer, and large blocks on nodes in server halls. Decentralization was meant to be ensured through the game theoretic incentive of mining, not through handicapping the system. The block size cap was due to spam risk and not centralization. 
Exploiting holes in nodes intending to deploy a protocol closer to that vision is obviously an attack.
You're too busy with your own word games to realize you're not being objective. 
~~How do you imagine Bitcoin scaling to millions of transactions without losing decentralization?~~
Rephrased: what's your plan to scale without losing decentralization? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 10:40:19
Is the increased transaction volume coming with the price and associated delays a sign of it working well? 
Who said nobody can't ever change the rules of the Bitcoin blockchain? There's no evidence that it would kill trust to that degree, because it would require majority agreement every time. Even Satoshi himself expected Bitcoin to change drastically over time, including bigger blocks. Who came and changed the rules and said "this is what we got and it can never change"? 
How does allowing choice in clients and protocol rules contradict Bitcoin being about choice? 
Those changes require cooperation (updated clients) from a majority of the network to have an effect. And only works for classical payments in most cases. 


The only way out *that you can ever have* without a hardfork is a SegWit style softfork implementing Zero-knowledge proofs, in  what would essentially be a sidechain "attached" directly to Bitcoin in the way SegWit's proofs are. 
This still has almost all of the same effects as a hardfork, with the exception that people wouldn't *need* to change clients to still access Bitcoin (but not changing clients would mean you don't benefit from the scaling). It would still add additional data, make mining more complicated, and much more. 
That's YOUR limits to work with. 
No, not only bad things can happen. Good things like not failing under increased load, more flexible scripting, etc, all that is good stuff that can happen. 
It seems like you'd rather have Bitcoin die and lose to an altcoin than change. 
If everybody acknowledged from the start that Bitcoin would have to change (and still be Bitcoin, because the real essence of it is the PoW driven blockchain), why would it stop being Bitcoin later? Just because somebody disagrees because they came in with expectations and desires that didn't match what was promised? 
Bitcoin was not promised to be what you ask, to be set in stone. So why does your will take precedence?

@_date: 2017-02-04 22:01:13
They can't coup if any rule violations are easy to detect and reject. Another reason I'm a fan of Zero-knowledge proofs. Making SPV mode more powerful is a pretty important goal, IMHO.
They can't hardfork in rules without the users accepting it, and softforks still behave exactly the same.
And in fact, such solutions would even make safe mining easier.
Pools, exchanges / payment processors and big service providers would be the most well known "full nodes", and unable to break any rules undetected. Both miners and clients would get block data and fresh transaction data from them.

I did. You're ignoring half my argument. 
So you're using that with your employees. That's 100 transactions. 
But those employees surely spend money elsewhere than the company store, right?
Let's look at a small town. 
10 000 people, 50 businesses, about a dozen transactions per person a day. 
Over 100 000 transactions per day normally. 
With LN between every pair of people transacting, we get let's say 10 000 x 50 active channels (could be more or less), so 50k x 2 = 100k transactions yearly. 
Now federated LN, let's assume 10x servers with each connected to 5 others: (10 000 + 50) x 2 + 10*5/2 x 2 = 20 150 transactions yearly, just above 20k. 
Would you look at that, 80% transaction savings.

Similar to the age old sidechains concept. 
Again, securely. You will need majority of miners to implement its rules, it at least not violate them. You need clients that can trust the rules are followed (no inflation, etc). 
Zero-knowledge proofs adds that. Efficient compact proofs of having followed the given rules. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:05:40
Can only be done with efficient Zero-knowledge proofs if you're going beyond segwit type solutions. Anything else is infeasible if we want meaningful security. 
Segwit keeps basic individual transaction data in the blockchain and separates signatures. Zero-knowledge proofs lets you effectively turn the block into a compressed UTXO set diff plus a compact Zero-knowledge proof, preserving enforcement of scripts while you don't need to expose their internals on the blockchain.
I haven't seen any other solution whatsoever that doesn't make severe compromises.

You can train your rats to only work when their electronic collars says they should. Then the customer can use a Bitcoin payment channel for pay-as-you-go usage, and some Internet connected device of yours broadcasts the status to the collars. If the customer cancels or stops paying, your rats knows to stop working.
The neat thing is that you don't need to sign up with any bank to do that. A Raspberry Pi and a WiFi + Bluetooth dongle and Digikey style electronics in the collars with Bluetooth shields would be all the hardware you need, and all the software you need is open source. No third party servers involved. 
Not that I know of any meaningful way to integrate that into your business model, I presume your work is on contract with predefined hours. Just telling you about a cool thing that's possible.
Another cool thing would be to use Bitcoin for coordination through usage of broadcasts in transactions with OP_RETURN. Then all the servers in the world could go down, you just need a few working Bitcoin nodes to fetch and verify it.

Only if the majority can't handle those larger blocks.
If the majority says "that's too much now", they'll just refuse to accept larger blocks. I have no idea why you think it would work to silently increase blocks until there's only one miner left. Do you think EVERYBODY else​ are dumber than you? That no other miners or node owners understand Bitcoin?
I never said only a few should be able to run a node. But a Bitcoin that can scale will not let people run full nodes on smartphones. Gigabit lines are already common, so what are you so afraid of? Why should the weakest nodes dictate capacity? 
Why should everything run a node? How does that even help anybody?
You just can't seem to understand game theory. You're denying obvious responses (thinking that slow increases is enough to make everybody blind to the problem of excessive blocks). You totally ignore the possibility of the majority rejecting too large blocks - you won't even acknowledge the possibility! And telling me that my argument reduces to something in contradiction with the arguments I've been giving is also pretty stupid.

You don't even know if that's possible. Stop claiming it is a certainty, or defend your argument by explaining how and why that and nothing else will happen.
Ridiculous. There's no magical removal button or feature. That CAN ONLY happen if there at all points in time is only a minority in favor of smaller blocks, and if there's no penalty for larger blocks, and if cost for running a full node increases excessively. 
Everybody has a pain threshold​ for block size. Again, if most small miners are forced to drop out (technically speaking small pools, as most miners can change pools), then others will too. like merchants.
There's no boiling the frog here. And you have no argument in favor of the opposite. By the time it gets close to a problem it will get reversed BEFORE the last miners gets kicked out.
Nobody will want to see a single pool with its miners dominate. If block size drives their growth, they'll never hit 30% before block size gets capped.


Either lies or lack of comprehension.
A) It can happen far in advance.  
B) People can start up NEW nodes and create a fork from a prior point where block size was reasonable. THIS IS TRIVIAL!
And then the majority of regular users are on B type nodes, for which the adversial large blockchain *doesn't appear to exist* because it fails validation. They'll mine on a new forked chain with smaller blocks where old miners can return. Do you think their hardware just explodes from large blocks...?
That miner can't do shit because everybody else just pretends they can't hear him.
You just don't understand psychology or game theory or the Bitcoin protocol. You wouldn't make that kind of arguments otherwise. Everything you're saying is just ad-hoc, without reason behind it.

Block space is only devalued if supply drastically exceeds demand AND if there's enough miners that isn't willing to participate in forcing high fees, so that users don't feel they need to pay high fees to get their transactions processed fast enough. 
A too crowded blockchain would eventually get abandoned in favor of just about anything else that achieves whatever goal the users has. Which would devalue the entire currency.

It technically does, though. 
But you probably know I meant bigger issues - when there's a reasonable demand for the system to behave differently, it is unreasonable to actively kill all discussions about change. 
Resilience is not fighting adaptivity. Resilience is being able to handle FUTURE threats as well. Refusing to change may be consistency, but definitely isn't a sign of resilience (unless you can prove the system is already perfect). 
An unmodified but completely abandoned Bitcoin is going to be less worth than a modified Bitcoin with a bunch of happy users and a few angry ones. 
I don't get why you think a 99% fork is necessarily an attack. Are people not allowed to believe another way of doing things is superior? What if it really is? Should anybody be able to kill an improvement by manufacturing dissent? If the majority of users agree, the problem will solve itself.

Price being higher implies greater demand, which implies higher load, which implies the cap being hit worse than now with far longer waiting periods to get transactions confirmed. 
Most people knows the worst case scenario won't just leave Bitcoin dead in hours, but that it rather would be a slow demise over a few weeks when the cap is being hit 24/7 and when no single workable solution is being accepted by the majority of the network. People don't want to sell off too quickly in case it recovers and the problem is solved. 
People hope it will be fixed before the problem becomes unavoidable.

I've already said I'm not in favor of BU specifically, but rather any scaling that works. Larger blocks being one of the necessities unless we get zero-knowledge proofs working soon enough.
I can't believe you're still trying to frame me as being the extremist when you're the one ignoring arguments and demanding to be believed in who knows what grounds. You're not even trying to explain the mechanisms that would cause they you're describing.
I can just as well as you claim they BU by design will move towards optimal block sizes because the average full node will penalize too large blocks.
In fact, nodes could add a proof-of-work subtraction relative blocksize to force miners that are creating larger blocks to work much harder than those creating small ones. How about that? I just solved 90% of your feared problem.

Only for signature data, which gets separated out. And it needs broad adoption to have a significant effect. At the same time, script data in transactions is larger with segwit to provide a syntax that works with a softfork. 
At the same time, even with MAST you'll see plenty of transactions in the future with larger scripts that will not benefit much from segwit in terms of number of additional transactions that fit per block. 
In other words, we need both.

That limit didn't exist when block  was generated. It didn't exist for months. Somewhere when the block count had hit 5 digits is when the limit was created.
This was also not a hardfork in the technical sense (at least not intended as one). The 0.8 version was reversed back to 0.7 until a safe upgrade could be implemented. The bug was in the old version 0.7, triggered by version 0.8's slightly different behavior.

@_date: 2017-03-29 10:40:14
Efficient chainable Zero-knowledge proofs would indeed allow just that. A single block could in fact have its block contents be validated in steps - first a local merchant puts all of their own transactions in one batch, then their payment processor merges the batches of their merchants, then those batches are sent to pools who merges those batches, etc... It would require that there's efficient proofs of batches being collision-free, but the UTXO sets does that pretty well. 
In fact, most people wouldn't necessarily know what's actually on the blockchain except for the UTXO hashes. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:44:59

Economic majority will drag along the majority hash rate with it. BU would need not just miners but also users to switch, or else it would end up seeing itself become worthless while everybody else remains on the old chain.

Yes, but that also further prove my point. Identity can't be proven at a distance without in-person verification first being performed by a trusted entity. 
You do indeed have to trust the verifiers and their entire process. 
The verifying entity may certainly document their process using the blockchain, but I don't think you gain all that much from doing it that way. 
Again, more clearly: there are no unique information you can provide that on it's own without any external dependencies can convince another person at a distance that you are one single person, which can't be repeated by somebody else, where every response from you can be tied together as coming from you, where you can't fake being somebody else, based on nothing else than you being you (the physical person).

The point of running nodes is to keep the network working, to validate transactions so you know the chain is correct, etc. Making sure nobody can lie about the blockchain.

Strawman + red herring.


Anybody capable of trying will be producing large enough blocks to themselves get kicked out by the rest of the Bitcoin network.
Why are you trying to avoid to understand that fact?
If you produce a big fat valid block and abuse that to mine faster than others, since others need more downtime before they can mine on the next block, then you will invariably also slow down verification for the rest of the network too. **THIS IS UNAVOIDABLE**!
This includes everybody. Users, payment processors, merchants, companies, etc.
It is at this point that the network would declare that this miner is abusive and set a softforked block cap below what that miner is generating.
At this point the miner CAN NOT continue abusing the network with excessive blocks. Other nodes will tell him his large blocks are invalid and be done with it.
If he keeps trying to create larger blocks, he'll be isolated in his own bubble. The other miners will mine on smaller blocks, and - wait for it - the entire damn world will only follow that chain with reasonably sized blocks.
I don't understand your position. Why are you pretending that block size increases have be reversed?
Or you just don't understand, making you the poster boy for Dunning Kruger. You have shown no evidence of understanding Bitcoin. All you're doing is to repeat the same dumb shit.

Remember Bitcoin XT? BU wasn't even a thing when I first wanted bigger blocks + segwit + LN. Not even Bitcoin Classic existed yet.
You seem to assume people are only for Core or anti-Core. A part of the misinformation war was exactly that black and white falsification of who wants what. Lots of small blockers actively drove away and smeared everybody who asked for anything that is different from the status quo.
People cheered when XT nodes were attacked and forced offline with DDoS. How is that productive? Those are the people that turned the disagreement into this war that you call it. It was started by *them*. The extremist small blockers, narrow minded status quo defenders and those confused people who demands that everybody must be able to run a full node just because Bitcoin was called P2P cash, and think that means the blockchain must never require more resources than an ADSL line can support. Anybody asking for scaling was actively fought. 
That's why the community split. That's why people started fighting back and trying to subvert the existing power structures, to take away those people's ability to fight scaling. And why everything became so hostile. 
The problem with Core is the policy and priorities. Being a good engineer doesn't make you a good manager.
Being anti-Core doesn't even make you pro-BU, that's another false dichotomy.

And then there's more categories. People who support segwit but ask for more since it isn't enough by itself. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:28:34
But it can't grow solid if it grows unusable due to an inability to adjust. It Bitcoin can't handle the load that these investors need it to handle, Bitcoin will end up forgotten. 
Bitcoin was meant to enforce its own rules on its own blockchain. Not to stop others from adopting other rules in their own forks. Bitcoin is about choice. 
Soft forks can ban behavior people rely on too, like invalidating opcodes.
I'm in favor of segwit too. But it isn't enough by itself. We need that AND more. Even with segwit + LN Bitcoin can't handle even a million simultaneous users due to the frequent on-blockchain channel settlements. That's absolutely not enough for global adoption. Not even for national adoption in most countries. 
Running a particular client is a vote for its protocol rules, in that you'll only participate in blockchains it considers valid. That's adds to that chain's economic value, influencing others through network effects, as well as affecting the choice of miners.

That's RSA. ECDSA is somewhat similar, but not exactly the same. ECDSA itself does not deal with encryption at all.
In RSA, you encrypt the hash with the private key and decrypt with the public one to sign and verify signatures, and you then check that the hashes match. 
In ECDSA, you process the hash with very different math, and verification is done by recalculating the public key from the hash and the generated signature, and then checking that the public keys match.
@_date: 2015-05-04 22:15:24
Yes. That would work. Note that you'd have to make sure your node doesn't get a copy of the transaction sent to it, or it will treat it as if it sent it itself due to it being created with your own addresses. In other words, wait for some days until the network forgets the transaction.

Not quite. An iterated version of something almost similar. And there's numerous stable strategies for it. 
Worst case is that the userbase just doesn't want to fund any significant amount of mining, in which case the network security level drops until the users gets spooked into paying more again. It does stabilize.

Using no 3rd parties at all with LN hurts scaling 
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:02:18
Then you can't do math. Or you can't read. 
50 transactions with you to create payment channels, because the example I used was that you employ 50 people. 50 settlement transactions. That's 100 transactions. 
Then we multiply that 100 transactions with the number of entities they transact with. So we reach thousands. 
In my example with LN and a few servers, the number of transactions are users\*2 + server interconnections\*2. So just above 100 in most cases.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:49:04
I inferred from context, perhaps I read in too much. But the root comment complained about needing 3rd parties, and you basically said I was wrong when all I said is that LN scales better with 3rd parties than without. So I interpreted that as you thinking it would not be beneficial in any way with 3rd party LN servers.

XT was no weaker than Core, they were simply flooded. A bunch went offline due to bandwidth caps. Core nodes would have failed exactly the same way.
It wasn't a "war" back then, the way it is now. Starting XT was a way to force the discussion to move forwards, to force the stonewalling against calls for greater scaling to end. Instead of accepting that some people have different priorities and discussing it, trying to compromise, some people responded with hostility and malice.
There were already different ideologies. It split into factions when those opposing all change decided that discussions of alternatives had to be banned that the community was forced apart. Those saying that &gt;1MB blocks just isn't Bitcoin, that full nodes must be possible to run on dated computers, etc. 
Long before XT, there were already a lot of voices demanding that Bitcoin can't change. And they would not discuss it.

Without Zero-knowledge proofs, there's still some linearity in transaction verification where you check for dependencies. That still sets a cap together with the time limit between blocks.

10 000 000 users' LN commitment transaction at a size of at least 200 bytes each would take 1900+ MB. That's the same amount of blocks, or 13 days *if they're the only thing added to the blockchain*. That sets the minimum payment channel lifetime at 4 weeks - because as soon as you settle, you need to create a new channel (two separate transactions). 
That also excludes settlement transactions between LN servers. It also excludes literally all non-LN usage.

You yourself didn't justify why segwit is so much better. Segwit (it adopted by most wallets) mostly just reduces validation cost for transactions with many signatures. Meanwhile it actually increases the total raw size of blocks with the same transactions as a non-segwit block, because the segwit commitments adds overhead.
To small miners, a segwit block with 2 MB of raw data (transaction data + signatures / witness) is close to equal to a plain 2 MB block.

@_date: 2017-01-25 12:40:52
Why would it be? There's literally no incentive to accept transactions with fees too low to make money mining. 
Either the fees are enough, or mining scales down until fees are enough. Once it scales down, people will have to choose between accepting the lower hashing power or to pay more to get it increased. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:07:26
Bitcoin mining costs will always closely follow the mining reward, because mining difficulty always automatically adjust to maintain the 10 minute interval. 
Increasing currency value and transaction fees increase reward value =&gt; more mining, and with reduced currency value and reduced fees =&gt; less mining. 
Given the relatively small overhead cost of the electronics of mining, the electricity cost will dominate the mining costs over the long term. 
So if the mining reward is X dollars worth per block, close to X dollars will be spent on electricity for mining. Because if miner A don't spend more on mining when it's profitable, then miner B will in order to claim more of the reward. And if it becomes unprofitable, everybody scale down mining until its profitable again.

As soon as you drop the transaction costs so low that you can't make a profit, you must scale down your mining or raise the minimum fee. Then others will take your place, and people will either accept larger fees or mining will stay at a lower level. 
Miners will always set the fees such that the expected reward covers their costs with some profit, keeping in mind what fees the active users will accept.

Segwit must first activate, then LN routing must be figured out properly (it doesn't just have to work, it has to perform well and be reliable), then it has to be reviewed and polished up and finished, then implemented in wallets. Then LN servers have to be started by various organizations. 
THEN you can pick somewhere to sign up for an LN wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:36:06
Yes, pretty much. Although you could also be the LN equivalent of companies like Level2 and be a backend-only interconnection service, being the one that other servers connect to for their routing.
You don't save anything on being the only user of an LN server, however. At minimum there needs to be one other user (either on your server, or on another server you're connected to) that you transact frequently with to save anything. 
Which is like saying "be Youtube" instead of "be a youtuber", but anyway. Although there's far more room for additional backend servers, nobody's forced to only use one.

Not decided yet, because I don't yet know what will be necessary (including future scaling proposals). Without being able to estimate a likely adoption rate and approximate timeline for future scaling solutions, it's hard to estimate what blocksize would cause the least trouble. I'm just certain that number is at least higher than 1MB. There's nothing anywhere near getting out of the "preliminary research stage" that could handle that degree of load with just 1MB blocks.

Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees. 
It's a special form of transaction scripts that allows you to build very large and complex transactions instructions (enabling very complex "programs" with lots of conditional instructions), and then only reveal small parts of it when creating your transaction, so that the final transaction can be very small and yet still have the full MAST script enforced securely. 
As a comparison, consider a large complex business contract, where an individual payment / check to fulfill a part of the contract only needs to reference those few conditions that this particular payment depends on. And nobody on the outside needs to see the full contract, the individual payment can be validated as correct on its own.

Define "the project". The users? Those people are users too. The developers? They don't own the blockchain, and the name also isn't trademarked (although I do think they should have used a different name to not be confusing). 
What exactly can they "gatekeep"? Just contributions to Bitcoin Core, and that's where their authority stops. Literally everything else is up to the individual members of the community, they're the ones choosing what client to use and thereby what system of rules to follow. 
They did make their own, based on Bitcoin. They used resources *that are all free to use*. Where's the rules saying they can't? 
I simply do not acknowledge reusing the same blockchain as being a form of "stealing". Do you say the same thing about the ethereum fork? 
What exactly was scammy about XT? 
I thought Bitcoin was explicitly designed for miners to use it to their selfish gain. It's supposed to work anyway, that's what it's whole security architecture is designed to handle. Bitcoin tries to make it profitable to help enforce the rules, so that's what selfish miners does.

It requires more storage space and processing power and bandwidth by miners, exactly the same way as a simple block size increase would (with some tradeoffs). 
Segwit mostly just allows you to prune more data when storing the blockchain, and allows non-verifying nodes to save bandwidth.
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:44:25
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:44:21
Signatures are retained, but aren't stored inside the base block. A full segwit block is base block + witness data structure.

Isn't that the same thing? If everybody includes all transactions, then they'll be equally split on average, proportional to hashing power. Nobody is able to hoard unconfirmed transactions. 
The miners' costs *are* what pays for proof-of-work.
If the fees paid drops, then *everybody* must scale down mining to remain profitable. Either it scales down and never stops, or people pay more in fees. Either because they're worried about dropping hashing power, or because too few miners accept low fees (delaying those transactions considerably). Because fast transactions is another valuable thing to pay for. 
The miners aren't dumb and will maximize for ROI, not just per-block profit maximization.

Signatures are moved out of the transactions to a separate data structure, that tags along with the base block. So a full segwit block is base block + witness data structure. Old nodes just see regular 1 MB max blocks (the base block) with anyone-can-spend transactions (segwit format). The total size of the two is 4 MB max.

Cons: complex, for maximal gain it still requires reliance on transaction processors (Lightning Network routing servers) that the users would need to register with

If people don't understand the consequences then that's their problem, but I'm looking at functional equivalence. It behaves like it, the code can be fully rewritten to act like it and yet remain 100% compatible, so it's real to me. 
It's just like any other bug and quirk in any implementation of a spec. You can say that only the official spec and intention counts, but if everybody has to be compatible with the standard implementation (like the Win32 API) then it's just as real as the official spec. It doesn't matter if Wine and ReactOS takes completely different approaches to Windows. If it behaves the same then that's all that matters.
The limits are real and are there, because nothing can be done to break them without the block becoming invalid.

Lightning is for everybody that makes frequent transactions. Individuals included. Companies with frequent transactions have the most to gain. That's why it's also a *network*, so you can all be on one server each and have your payments routed across them to each other. There just has to be a path of connected servers between you. Lightning Network takes 1-to-1 payment channels and connects them in a network. 
Commitment and settlement transactions must still happen on the blockchain. Payment channels are time limited. That's where miners still collect fees.

Every technical explanation I've seen looks approximately like this;
A segwit transaction is created with an anyone-can-spend template specific to segwit. This is a non-default but valid format on older nodes. A hash of the script data is included. This is signed, then a hash of the signature is embedded. This is all transmitted together when making a transaction. 
Then a block of formed, and the segwit data structure (called explicitly this) in the form of the signatures with their commitments &amp; pointers to their respective transactions are hashed to create a commitment hash to put in the coinbase transaction. Is this part then ONLY done in RAM/cache? This isn't *stored* in a block apart from the transaction scripts? 
I'm assuming that the future group signature scheme (Schnorr signatures?) would have the combined signature in the coinbase too. Would the signature stripping in transactions then occur directly inside segwit blocks too? (no space saved otherwise) 
Also, I'd like to note that for as long as backward compatibility is preserved with stripping function = an internal representation of how the block has to look to be valid for old nodes, and base block limit = 1 MB, then technically that limit remains. You "just" altered the internal representation and modified the semantics. Because stripped block = stripped but still valid transactions without signatures. It may not be the default representation, but it's a real one.

Technically the total per transaction size is a bit larger due to the added hash commitments of the signatures and the anyone-can-spend script transaction format. But more of them fits in a block since the signatures are "segregated" to its own section. 
Schnorr signatures (merged signatures / group signatures) might however reduce it again.

I'm not seeing the evidence that 20th century history has exhausted all possible configurations of implementations of socialism. A history of failure doesn't prove it will always fail. You could have said the same thing about airplanes in the 1800's.
No political affiliation, haven't found any evidence of the existence of any current ideology that isn't full of ignorance and even trivial factual errors. There's some good ideas in most places, but everybody are always trying to phrase theirs as an all-or-nothing deal. I really have no interest in getting involved in politics at all (too much dumb conflict). The closest would be social liberalism (but there's plenty of stupid there too), or pretty much anything else focused on cooperation without restricting people. 
Most of the changes people want to enforce with laws should instead be enforced with a change in culture, and/or with improved system designs that make malice unprofitable compared to cooperation (which is exactly what Bitcoin does with its mining incentives). People should help others because it's the right thing to do. They should cooperate because that's the most efficient on a society wide scale. They also shouldn't interfere in anything that doesn't hurt anybody. The rest are mostly low level details that are too contextual to set in stone.

4) without replay protection, most fresh transactions right after the fork are valid on both chains. Every coin exists on both sides, and can be transferred on both sides separately. So a transaction on one side can be copied over. 
This can be reliably solved by only making transactions including (guaranteed unique) freshly mined coins from after the fork. Or you make two conflicting transactions, one on each chain, and hoping the they both get accepted on one chain each. 
With replay protection, they act entirely as different blockchains.

It's not a meaningful goal. Anything trying to resist ASIC:s must target a common CPU or GPU architecture and use its instruction set in a very convoluted way. But you're very unlikely to perfectly utilize 100% of the hardware, which means some components can be stripped out. And it's very very unlikely that your particular way of using the instructions can't be simplified/improved in hardware, such as merging a pair of instructions or adding caches / lookup tables or increasing bandwidth in some places, etc. 
So the manufacturer of that model of processor you targeted can build a reduced version, likely with a higher clock speed, that does the exact same thing faster with less energy. Suddenly they have an ASIC for your algorithm!

Lots of memory access can be cut out with additional processing. Just like how your can reduce memory access for text with compression. Sometimes doing that extra processing + the regular computation is faster, because the extra time it took is less than the saved time from the memory access. You can also put the processor cores closer to the memory than in the original generic design, which likely wasn't memory access optimized. You also get more parallelism in mining, so that's more things to cut out (communication between cores is unused, for one).

It's a way to format transactions differently so that the digital signatures are stored in a data bundle (witness data structure) next to the standard block (base block), the latter of which then would hold transactions that just contain hashes of their signatures rather than listing all their signatures internally. 
This fixes a bunch of bugs and makes a few future planned protocols safe to use, and allows for potential future optimizations like using fancy math to merge all these signatures into a single one to save space without breaking the Bitcoin block syntax, and more. It's also more efficient for transactions with many signatures.

@_date: 2017-08-03 09:11:37
Nothing much written down yet. It's not even in the blueprint stage yet. 
It can technically be softforked on top of Bitcoin. It would take the approach of extension blocks (a bit like segwit's witness data structure), you send your coins to a special address (anyone-can-spend format, handled like segwit does it) to move them into the new system, and you can receive your coins back to the standard blocks from there. 
Within the extended blocks, every transaction is handled like above. This pretty much implements that desired sharding mechanism securely by having user selected entities track and route transactions, while aggregating proof data of these coin movements. Every tracker is responsible for the coins in their "domain". 
Anybody can become a "tracker" just like how anybody can become an LN server, and every tracker represents a "shard" (domain) where the internal transaction capacity only is limited by computing power and internal bandwidth. Across them, only external bandwidth restrictions adds to the capacity limit. 
All transactions in between "trackers" would need to be mutually signed/validated by both of them (and this would also be done in aggregated bundles), like how atomic transactions are handled in a distributed database. Each tracker "owns a lock" on their coins in the blockchain database.
I haven't even decided on a fixed terminology yet. But I want Turing complete MAST type transactions to be part of it. In another future extension, we'd add a full API driven scripting platform, where anybody can create their own managed domains with arbitary API:s. Anything smart contracts are expected to one day do could be done in these systems. Register and enforce wills? Sure. Namecoin? Absolutely. And it would barely take any on-chain space.
I would like to see something of a domain language meta-language, where you create a blockchain domain by creating your domain language that simultaneously declare the API:s for how to interact with it and how it works, and registering it on the blockchain with a domain ID. There would be code templates and standard API:s for how to interact with Bitcoin coins and more. So you could automate prize payments in competitions, for example.
Same thing with bounties in general. If it can be proven to be fulfilled with only code, it can be handled by this without any need for interaction.

Because a Visa transaction is a request to a bank to transfer some sum from some account to another. It is an IOU, a credit transaction, a promise. The entry in their database isn't what holds the value. The agreement between the banks and Visa that the transaction was valid plus the fact that your bank credited you with the sum is what give you the value. 
In Bitcoin, holding the key to an UTXO *is* holding the value itself.

Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) validated checkpoints. That's my top favorite solution today for compressing the stores blockchain data without any security reduction. 
My favorite idea for how to scale the network throughput is a lot more complicated, and is basically a more advanced version of LN using a kind of "federated" system, operating much like an atomic distributed database. You'd link your coins (UTXO's) to a "tracker" much like LN servers, and they would track the coin movements until settled. Then Zero-knowledge proofs are generated of the new balances periodically, and miners bundle up such balance statements and further compress them all into a single one with a new Zero-knowledge proof. Then that ends up on the blockchain. 
Periodically the blockchain itself gets pruned, with an associated Zero-knowledge proof. 
All you would need to store to receive transactions is the blockchain headers + ZKP, and to spend you'd need that + the blockchain UTXO data for the coins you're spending + any private transaction data for those UTXO's scripts required to spend. 
The full blockchain would look a lot more like just a hash tree with a ton of commitments than like a bundle of transactions. 
There could also be an option to have MAST-like transactions with ZKP, with pretty much all transaction data except commitment hashes offloaded from the blockchain. You'd have to track your own state data to be able to prove your right to spend your coins.

I'm saying your perception of what the whitepaper says is somewhat inaccurate. 
It makes very few value judgements, besides arguing against the necessity of centralized banks, and is essentially a proof of concept. As a part of that, cash equals a transferable token that can hold value. It doesn't care about how you then use it or how the token is transferred (on-chain or LN). It doesn't care about which types of payments you make with it (buying an island or buying coffee). And so on... 
You seem to be reading in too much in it.

With limited blockchain capacity, the vast majority of people will by default be priced out of it as a result of not affording to compete on fees against rich people / companies. 
There's also no inherent value (that I know of) in having your raw transactions on the raw blockchain which can't be replicated by other means. Given improvements in Zero-knowledge proofs and similar techniques even the full capabilities of the scripting language can be preserved, with proof of publication and all these other properties of the blockchain which people care about.

Of course Bitcoin can scale a little. But again, it can't scale *alone* to handle the entire planet's transactions. In fact we need them both, because even LN alone needs an increased blocksize to handle the expected volume of opened and closed payment channels for an entire country's usage. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 12:46:06
And why exactly should capacity be limited? 
Most people simply won't afford the fees. They could easily rise to thousands of dollars per transaction, because that's what the rich people would be willing to pay.

There's literally only two ways to get around it to let it scale without a hardfork - extension blocks and Zero-knowledge proofs for compressed checkpoints. The former has the exact same practical tradeoffs as larger blocks, with only implementation details differing. The latter is so far away that if we're going to wait for it to become ready, Bitcoin will already have fallen into obscurity and been forgotten by then, replaced by altcoins willing to scale.

For the sum of all of the above, less than a single slow KDF function computation (with proper settings).


For your argument to work you have to pretend you can compute the full KDF faster than that.
To quote you back at yourself;


That's not a possibility. You will not ever end up in a situation where you are be able to construct a circuit that can run a heavy slow KDF in milliseconds and yet NOT ALSO be able to compute the Bloom test in *nanoseconds*.


THIS WILL NEVER BE SLOWER THAN THE KDF ITSELF if the KDF is configured properly 
Quoting you again
The attacker has a 1T:1 advantage on that function. trillions of solutions per second. Hell, the memory bandwidth to send solutions to the correctness tester will be the gating factor


Are you literally insane? It's trivial to implement a Bloom filter check in hardware in the same ASIC that test the KDF. You send the Bloom filter TO THE ASIC so that NO COSTLY LOOKUPS ARE NECESSARILY! You can trivially perform that check locally near or inside the bruteforce rig. 
Bloom filters are used in graphics for gaming on GPU:s for a reason, THEY'RE FAST! 
And above all else, THE BLOOM FILTER DOESN'T CHANGE IF THE BLOCKCHAIN DOESN'T, and even if it changes then that only means you might get false positives / false negatives against some addresses if there's new transactions. 
Every single SPV server (lightweight wallet server) creates new bloom filters IN MILLISECONDS against the active UTXO set every time a new block has arrived. This is easy and fast and already being done! 


Up to 2^20 x ratio is acceptable, at minimum 2^10. This is still a real world advantage that protects some users against cracks. 
What you don't get is that the adversary CAN NOT circumvent this - they ALWAYS have up pay that much extra per test, since that is how much extra they MUST pay per pipeline computation cycle in electricity. 


This only reduce the linear latency advantage (the adversary can compute it faster). It does NOT reduce the cost advantage by much (the extra speed carries the penalty of higher electricity cost for the adversary, and even optimal implementations are barely better in cost versus CPU). 


The Bloom filter can trivially be implemented in hardware (GPU or ASIC or FPGA) and WILL ALWAYS run faster than the KDF with similar resources available.
I seriously don't understand what could possibly make you believe that the performance profile and chip efficiencies could be such that anything but the KDF is the limiting factor. There's literally no evidence of this.

Coins are tied in the open channel, yes. 
To move larger sums your have to commit more coins. You can only safely spend transactions as big as or smaller than your initial commitment. But you can send and receive endlessly. 
If you run an LN server, it's like running something like your own Visa, or an email server. You connect to other servers (requires mutual agreement on terms), and advertise to users to register with you. As a user you just register with a server. The server handles routing, even to users on other servers. 
See above. 
Geolocation is irrelevant. 
Commitment and settlement transactions are normal Bitcoin transactions with normal fees. LN transactions fees are between the user and server, and decided between them (most servers will have standard contracts). 
Yes, the servers will compete on fees and other terms. Connectivity with other servers included.

The act of their creator selling those premined coins with the implicit promise that they'll go up in value is what makes it a security.

How on earth could such a thing exist? 
(besides the obvious fact that if private key computations are slow, then it's a *bottleneck* that artificially throttle the slow PBKDF2 function to be equally slow*) 
There's absolutely no plausible circumstances you can show under which an adversary will have resources to spend 64 bits equivalent of computing power on one (slow!) algorithm but only 34 bits worth on a (fast!) algorithm.
Not. A. Thing.
Can't and won't happen, the incentives are directly against it.
The adversary has ONE budget. 
The budget pays for logic gates, it pays for gate depth, it pays for clock cycles, and above all else it pays for kilowatt hours (energy). The adversary will have a cost per chip and an operating cost that will balance out to X dollars per Y algorithm cycles.
When the total cost even on an optimized chip is something like 500 cycles of algorithm A (fast hash) per 1 cycle of algorithm B (slow hash) for the same resources, then you still retain the prior advantage balance, just with tweaked margins.
There is no circumstance under which these incentives and pressures will lead to the fast hash being more expensive to compute per cycle than the slow hash. None whatsoever.
This line of reasoning is a dead end.
\* so you generated 1 password candidate. 
Now you have to run it through PBKDF2, then through ECC secp256k1 public key derivation, then through whatever address hash scheme is used. 
This is a linear pipeline - every step is rate limited by the slowest step. If you can compute PBKDF2 1000x as fast as ECC then your ASIC is idling 99.9% of the time. It can not do work because it has nothing it can work on. It must wait for a new cycle with a new password to start working. That doesn't start again until ECC is done.
In your equation above, then *technically* option 1 is the correct answer, specifically because your hypothetical is unrealistic.
The point of the slow hash is that it's *slow*, which means it is a useless addition if it isn't the *slowest* function in the pipeline. It needs to be *the* thing that throttles other functions in the pipeline. 
Which means in the REAL world the slow hash will be slower than the ECC function, which means you can test many private keys per second, but only a few hashes, which in turn means you spend time idling and waiting for new hashes to derive keys from if you use a dedicated ECC / public key derivation ASIC. So you're throttled by the slow stretched hash / KDF. 
Which means in the example above, the correct answer is that you break neither. Because in a realistic setting you have a slow KDF / stretching function where you can only calculate 32 bits worth of plain hashes with your budget, which in turn means the 20 + 20 passwords are out of reach since you can only hit 12 + 20 bits worth of entropy in guesses with your budget.

The whitepaper is almost never complete with the full rationale. Satoshi mentioned frequently that full nodes would end up being run in datacenters, and that's literally why SPV mode was defined in the whitepaper. 
Because most of the work would eventually effectively be outsourced, with the security paid for through the fees from the users, with the mining rewards incentivizing competition to preserve the decentralization and security of the network. 
This included broadcasting transactions, routing, storing the blockchain, validation, etc... 
If it takes off-chain tech to enable that kind of scaling, then that's in line with Satoshi's vision.

I made some late edits.


The KDF value doesn't compute itself just because the starting point is known. In fact there's a whole field that rely on this fact, VDF:s (verifiable delay functions) where the public input can't be processed faster than at a certain rate. 
You can't know the output without X amounts of work. An amount of work that would correspond to Y bits of bruteforce.


You need to stop looking at single user usecases and look at the population.
It works permanently (enough) for the full set of users for which it puts them outside the budget for long enough, such that they eventually lose value as a target (death of the user, emptied wallet, etc).
If no adversary ever exceed X bits worth of entropy cracking, then stretching is a permanent successful defense for all users wherein stretching took their password past the limit.


THAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT
All users who exclusively rely on entropy with no stretching will get hit EXACTLY the same. Every entropic password that falls inside the adversary budget range gets pwned. 
Stretching will put SOME OF THEM back outside the budget range. Those users are the ones saved by stretching. 




A password file for banking is pretty much exactly the same. 
We're talking about millions of users, and the goal is to make sure as few as possible gets pwned. Exhaust the resources of the adversary. Stretching will save a notable number of users. There's always a few users just there around the edge. 
Choosing not to stretch is a choice to sacrifice those users. 




By default, computer generated randomness. 
Additionally it uses 2048 iterations of hashing which equals 11 bits of computational entropy, which is there as a result of the expectation that some users will choose their own words (poorly) because no part of the spec prevents users from choosing the words. 


\- He said after referencing a Bitcoin spec using stretching.
It works for Bitcoin PRECISELY because we know we can't prevent user stupidity, while we simultaneously know that the adversary budget is LIMITED, which results in the fact that we end up with a set of users that are within X bits of the cracking budget range. That's exactly why we stretch, because those additional computational bits saves the users near the limit.

In Visa's database, there is just a number on each account they increase or decrease. Just a counter. Your balance is what they tell you it is. Transactions are messages between banks and other financial institutions asking them to please increment or decrement the numbers. Your account history is simply a description of what transactions have been performed. You don't hold digital cash, you have a password to tell them to pretty please change the numbers according to your request. 
Digital cash systems have explicit tokens, distinct individual things represented by strings of data, where you transfer tokens and hold a collection of tokens. Equivalent to digital coins. A transaction is in itself the change of control / ownership, the transfer of a token between people. A token can't be duplicated. Your balance is the value represented by the tokens *you* hold.

I'm assuming we're targeting user provided seed values and thus look for the most common first public keys in the wallets (as you talked about earlier), since they're the most likely to hold coins in wallets that are in use. You could make a filter for all keys in the full blockchain (if you think most first addresses are emptied), and then guess the wallet type of any match from what derivation path an address matched against and then search for secondary addresses (matching them against the UTXO set). 
We are not likely to find completely arbitary private keys belonging to wallets further down the chain than the first ones, so we don't care to target them directly.


Hardware devices with their own TRNG:s which don't allow user chosen key material entropy are not affected by this class of bruteforce attack.
Wallets that accept user provided entropy for deriving the root key are the ones that are affected. Most of those can provide at least 100 MB, far more than the 4 MB used by typical scrypt implementations. 
130 000 brainwallets tested per second successfully found several real wallets. 
A million factor slowdown but Argon2 would make that attack unprofitable.

He says in response to the comment that literally enumerated a number of different threat models and explained the different impacts.
At this point I'm convinced you're deliberately not even reading full sentences anymore.
You're either incompetent or deliberately misrepresenting my argument.
You know perfectly well by now that there are numerous users generating their own seeds and passwords, you should know that cloud hosted wallet backups LITERALLY is an example of password protected files, and you just keep rejecting reality.
And you're completely clueless if you think a linear cryptographic computation pipeline can be effectively parallelized within one pipeline cycle.
Every single tested password MUST go through the full pipeline from start to end (password or seed &gt; KDF &gt; ECC public key derivation &gt; address hashing), and YOU CAN NOT TEST THESE STEPS INDEPENDENTLY! 
The slowest function in the pipeline sets the pace. You CAN NOT KNOW a generated password candidate was correct until you've completed the FULL pipeline processing (computed the slow hash) and compared against the set of known public key.
The adversary has a budget. Their dollars can pay for X compute cycles that varies for different algorithm pipelines. With Z dollars they can pay for 1000 cycles of algorithm A or 1 000 000 of algorithm B. Same resources required for both.

The difference is quite significant. One is *just* a list, for accounting. The other is actual transactions, the actual authorizations of token transfers. The recorded "receipt" *is* the transaction itself. 
There's nothing that says the tokens can't be split or merged. The key is that they are tokens and transferable. You hold the key to a UTXO. You create a transaction. That transaction creates new UTXO's and moves the value from your tokens into them. Bitcoin isn't even the first cryptocurrency to allow token splitting. The ability to "transform" the tokens is not much different from having access to a coin change machine. 
Nobody but you hold the ability to transfer your tokens in Bitcoin. Nobody but you can alter the values of your created UTXO's in your transactions. Once in the blockchain, the UTXO's are static and permanent. 
Visa's transactions follow Visa's rules because they want to (obviously). They can change the rules at will, modify the database at all (Bitcoin's blockchain is effectively immutable). Bitcoin has hard rules enforced by cryptography, not by decree. 
The blockchain is like a shared global database. Most wallets store the raw UTXO data to be able to generate transactions. The keys are used to authorize them.
Compare to gold: you have one piece, easy to verify, and you can split and merge pieces through melting them.

with a high error rate, or maybe one with 40 gb of
Are you aware that you can use multiple layers of bloom filters if you like? Start off with a super fast with a reasonably small error rate, then check matches against a more accurate filter, then pass off to the wallet. This reduces total memory bandwidth required. If you think this is impossible, show me the math. 
None of this will be slower per candidate address than the KDF itself. The KDF WILL still take close to a second to compute from start to end. Address lookups are NOT that slow. 


Somebody's trying to break into wallets. Literally the only thing that matters is trying to find the private key to a wallet currently holding coins. Those are all represented exactly by the UTXO set. The addresses from there is what you create a bloom filter off for quick lookups. Either your candidate address for the private key candidate you tested match an existing known wallet or not.

Mandatory compute cycles = bits of entropy in terms of bruteforce resistance
Slow function transformations HAVE THE SAME COST as equivalent additional entropy iteration.
The adversary has a budget.
You're ignoring the budget.
Your imagined adversary isn't a thing that can exist in the real world. I'm only talking about actual real life adversaries here, real humans and corporations living in the real world in a real economy.




As compared to what? You can't just give me *half* a question and expect an answer. 
BIP39 adds the equivalent of 11 bits stretching. A non stretched 60 bit password will be cracked exactly as fast as a 49 bit stretched password. EXACTLY as fast, always, in all plausible circumstances.
If the entropy of either is too much to crack, it doesn't get cracked. The end. If the computational work to crack it is too much, same thing.


We have numerous overlapping threat models.
* offline paper wallets from a secure CSPRNG
* Brainwallets
* online hosted password protected wallet backups
* online hosted wallet services
Brainwallets are the most exposed and has greatest benefit from stretching. Hosted encrypted files comes next in benefit - insider threats can target wallet file passwords. Hosted wallet services already trust the host, here the stretching only protects against leaked password databases. The offline paper wallet doesn't benefit.




Please talk to real cryptographers. Yes you're correct that information theoretic encrypt is not computational entropy.
You're still wrong about the conclusion. You're pretending that this means all algorithms can always be made to be computed equally fast with equal resources per cycle. This is blatantly false.
The adversary has a budget. We don't give a shit about the actual number of bits of entropy, we give a shit about the adversary not being able to afford cracking your password.
The same money, logic gates and electricity gives you more computed cycles of one algorithm than the other. You want your adversary to be limited to computing less cycles with the same resources. This is why stretching works. The adversary achieves less per dollar when you stretch.


NEVER EVER AT ALL FASTER than the plain non stretched hashing function, NEVER EVER cheaper per cycle than the plain unstretched hash.
This is why stretching works.


This is you admitting you have no empathy for users with less technical understanding, ignoring their harm if they get hurt


This reads like it's from a comic book universe with inverted laws of physics
Literally every password leak ever has proven you wrong. Every time the stretching difficulty is higher, a smaller fraction of passwords gets cracked than otherwise. 
Otherwise known as stretching functions successfully protecting people. 


Bizarro world. Literally every password leak where stretching was used protected some fraction of users, as evidenced by lower cracking success rates. 


You have a deep fundamental misunderstanding of physics and economics
Password hash stretching means each dollar spent by the adversary results in fewer cracked passwords than otherwise. This difference in numbers of cracks directly represents users saved from getting hacked.

Here you're talking a about a search space so small you can iterate through the whole thing and precompute all possibilities. You can amortize the CPU cost, you perform ~40 bits worth of work only once.


As according to the above, in computational terms it costs the same work as 41 bits of entropy does - but only once. After that you can reuse the final computed value at no extra cost.


Stretching only has value when you start off with low amount of entropy. There's no value in stretching when you already have a 128+ bit secret as a starting point. There is no adversary that will be stopped from cracking any secret specifically because of *that* stretching. 


None. The user isn't willing to wait that long. 
However, the adversary has a budget. 
If the adversary can crack 40 bit password and yours is 35 bits, you're screwed. But you can choose to add 10 bits and hit 45 bits, exceeding the budget of your adversary. 
You can achieve that both with adding 10 bits worth of random symbols (making the password longer), and also with 1000x slower stretched hashing. 
Both those options successfully places your password outside of the adversary's cracking budget. 


Assuming humans won't eventually control all matter in our solar system, even 128 bits is isn't getting cracked. With quantum computers and Grover's algorithm, 256 bits (squaring the keyspace) is out of reach from cracking.
However, all you need to do is exceed the adversary's budget.


Show me the math.
You can go from nanoseconds (hardware accelerated cryptographic instructions) to tens of seconds for some usecases. That's over 20 bits (over a million times advantage).
That's still adversary resources getting burnt. For every slow hash they could have computed a *million* more fast hashes with the same resources.
You're not protecting the weakest passwords.
You're protecting those who are close to the edge.
If the adversary has a budget for 60 bits, then stretching a million times saves everybody who had a 40+ bit password.
If the adversary's budget grows to 70 bits, then the people with 50+ bit entropy passwords + stretching are still safe.
Note that the decay is identical for both cases, with and without stretching. In the case without, an additional 10 bits of entropy was broken. In the second case, an additional 10 bits of entropy was broken. 
During the growth from 60 bit cracking capacity to the 70 bits, ALL users who has passwords that lie in exactly that range became vulnerable. It does not matter how they reached that bar - the user with 65 bits entropy lost in exactly the same way that the user with 45 bits entropy + 20 bits computational stretching lost. EXACTLY the same way. 
You once were outside the budget of the adversary, and then fell inside the crackable range. 
It's not about making all cracking impossible.
It's about making cracking so much more expensive, it's about exhausting the adversary's resources.




No, in multi user systems it's the ONLY threat model.
We aren't designing for that one well educated responsible user.
We're designing for the whole group of users at once. Stretching will save some of them.


Yes, I agree this is the ideal option.
It doesn't work. We don't live in an ideal world. You can't force people to use strong passwords. 
We WILL have users just below the edge of the adversary's budget. Stretching is made to protect *them*. It works. It saves people. That's why we use it.

You're underestimating how efficient rule based engines are at cracking sentences
Just rely on password length. If you want memorable phrases, then instead you should use a combination of short randomly selected ones. Like making a list of two word slogans and making a random selection (by dice or something) of 5 or 6 of them.
And why append the hash to the plaintext password? Just use the hash alone, makes no sense to include both.

A bloom filter calculator I found suggests 400 MB RAM with 13 hash calculations for testing against Bitcoin's UTXO set, absolutely manageable on an FPGA to keep up with the ASIC. And that's with a small error rate, enough that you can use just 1 layer of a bloom filter and pass matches straight to the wallet. 


Still not slower than the KDF. You're still computing a handful of public keys and corresponding addresses - this can still be done faster than the KDF, especially if you use an FPGA for the ECC calculations.
In every step along the way in these discussions you just keep missing exactly how much slower KDF:s are than all the other steps.
In fact, even your best case argument that an accurate bloom filter would be memory heavy and thus be the bottleneck falls apart against KDF:s like Argon2 which can itself be set to use 1 GB reserved RAM per instance / cycle. You can afford terabytes of RAM to parallellize a KDF and run it at milliseconds cycle speeds in an ASIC, but you somehow can't provide an FPGA with 500 MB (shared!) RAM...?
And all of this is assuming you can't use a more efficient implementation than classical bloom filters.
Like the recent Morton filters (by AMD people), where they could perform 50 million lookups per second in their *proof of concept* with even less memory usage and lower latency, on a general purpose CPU. 
So let's look at miners. There's scrypt miners at around 500 MH/s. Unimpressive, because scrypt is incredibly outdated and is configured to only use a handful of megabytes per instance. Even on an optimal ASIC, swapping out the function for Argon2 with a high workfactor and 1GB RAM usage (or even just a few hundred MB), will reduce this by a factor of thousands. There's no chance you can hit an MH/s rate without being able to accelerate the other parts too. With a modern KDF you can trivially slow down the attacker enough that the lookups aren't the bottleneck. And with such a high memory usage, parallellization becomes extremely costly.
If you can build an ASIC for Argon2 with that RAM usage, you can make an ASIC for for these filter lookups too (and probably optimize batch lookups while at it)

'Dkgklfjscsjlflfhdusj Carpe diem' is not weaker than 'Dkgklfjscsjlflfhdusj'. Pure additions don't remove entropy.
Rule based additions with terrible rules can be pointlessly weak and add no meaningful entropy.
And yet you don't lose entropy in your password for having made the addition.
It's only when you change the original password using the rules that you might begin losing entropy. Like if you read 'Dkgklfjscsjlflfhdusj' and decides you want to make it readable, so you *replace* the pieces with perhaps 'dog claw fish fluff dusk' because it sounds similar.
Now that you made *replacements* in a biased manner you did lose entropy.
But a pure addition that leaves the original intact don't remove entropy.
Only the bits onto which you apply your rules can lose entropy in such a replacement process, the untouched bits keeps all their entropy.
Rules applied to an addition only takes away entropy *from the addition itself* but maintains all entropy of the untouched original string. X + 0 = X.

Maybe you should read what I actually wrote instead of just assuming you know.
If it takes 1 millisecond to compute 1 fast hash, you can test 1000 hashes per second on 1 core. If it takes 1 second for a slow hash, you can test 1 per second on 1 core.
A 20 bit password with a fast hash can then be cracked in 1048 seconds on 1 core (2^20 / 1000).
A 10 bit password with a slow hash takes... 1024 seconds on 1 core (2^10 / 1)
So a linear time increase of 2^X per computed hash corresponds exactly to X bits of additional entropy in terms of the amount of computing power required to crack it!
An increase by a factor of thousands is still equivalent to at minimum 10 additional bits in bruteforce resistance.

You KNOW brainwallets is a thing


I already mentioned once you seem to have no empathy for those with less technical understanding.
This proves it. You will happily let them get hurt instead of allowing for a simple addition that will successfully protect many of them.


Anti-relevant reply. You're the one demonstrating your lack of understanding here. If you understood computing you'd understand the comparison. 
Every computational core in use here is based on networks of logic gates. Every logic gate requires energy for activation. All commonly used core architectures uses cores that run on locally uniform clock cycles, and these cycles require energy.
Every algorithmic function has a minimum number of computational steps required to process them (mathematical irreducibility). 
This means that every algorithm requires a minimum amount of logic gates and electricity and latency to compute from start to end. This means a minimum cost per cycle.
Slow KDF functions ALWAYS have greater cost and slower speed than fast hash functions. It ALWAYS costs more to compute a full KDF function computation than a fast hash function (when you use equivalent logic gate nodes, etc). 
The same resources that can compute one slow KDF in one cycle can ALSO be used to split up the same logic gates in MANY INDIVIDUAL cores which FOR THE SAME COST runs many fast hashes.
If the adversary has a fixed amount of dollars to spend on the attack to test password candidates, they'll ALWAYS successfully test more passwords for their dollars if they test fast hashes than for slow hashes, proportionally to the slowness of the KDF.
If the KDF is 1000x slower than the fast hash, they'll ALWAYS be able to test 1000x more hashes if they test the fast hash, which means the money pays for 1000x more successful password breaks against the fast hash!

No. Visa don't hold *tokens* for you. That's a digital payments system. Cash can't be duplicated (it can however be issued and redeemed by banks, but the supply at any given point in time is always well defined). 
PayPal however is linked directly to credit cards and third party banks, and moves around *promises* of money transfers. They act on your request. You don't control the currency in your PayPal account, they do and may or may not do what you ask. 
Tokens = cash. Each individual token is one individual unique thing with a given value. Can't be duplicated. Systems for value transfer = payments system. A payment system can transfer cash AND / OR debt based money (promises of transfers). 
The difference is that holding the token IS holding the value, the currency itself. But in systems like PayPal, you don't hold it yourself. It isn't even guaranteed to not be revoked (such as if you funded your PayPal account via credit card, and it got reversed).

The ASIC only does exactly one thing: reduce the linear advantage between user and attacker, when the attacker's implementation is more efficient than the user's implementation. Memory / cache heavy password hashing functions reduce this advantage. 
Instead of a 10 000x advantage (15 bits) maybe you get a 500x advantage (9 bits). *That's still a real contribution* that slows down the attacker. 
10 entropic bits + 10 computational bits (stretching) is equally hard to crack computationally as 20 entropic bits. 
The attacker WILL have to spend more resources than they did before. 
I already showed the math for how I indeed am assuming computing will get faster. A stretched password is simply as hard to crack as an equivalent *longer* password. The linear advantage from the computational hardness determines the equivalent number of bits in strength. 
So you can both add more length to the password and add more iterations to make cracking harder.
Even with acceleration stretching still matters. The most fundamental argument for why is this:
With the very same resources, that attacker would have successfully tested MORE passwords with no stretching, which means they would have successfully CRACKED more passwords without stretching.
Stretching: X passwords cracked 
No stretching: MORE than X passwords cracked, a multiple more that's proportional to the linear advantage added 
1000 CPU years cracks a certain amount of passwords. Stretched passwords reduce how many the attacker can test. That also reduces how many that gets cracked.
It's easy to add stretching. It's hard to convince users to improve their passwords. Stretching has a real world impact in how many users gets their passwords cracked.
The adversary always have limited resources. Stretching means their resources gets a smaller return than before.

So you're GENUINELY seriously assuming that checking if your generated public key matches a known public key in the blockchain is harder than generating a slow KDF hash? 
You're assuming that in the pipeline of seed/password &gt; KDF &gt; ECC public key derivation &gt; public key hashing &gt; key lookup, the bottleneck will be the lookup? Like, this is a genuine belief of yours? 
BLOOM FILTERS
Checking an arbitary public key against the full blockchain takes MILLISECONDS per key by checking against a bloom filter that you computed in advance from the public keys in the blockchain. 
If the bloom filters says you have a match, THEN you hand over the key to a wallet client.
The KDF (slow hash) is the bottleneck when you set the work factor appropriately.
If you can afford an ASIC to accelerate KDF computations at a high rate, then the rest of the computational pipeline is trivial to provide. Even if you have an ASIC running at 600 MHz with one full KDF computation per clock cycle / core (perhaps scrypt), you can likely still match this with a 4 GHz CPU and (an perhaps an FPGA) to compute the rest of the pipeline (ECC, bloom lookups, etc) at the same rate. The KDF will STILL be the most expensive part to compute (because it will still require a shitton of logic gates and electricity).

You can not seriously believe that a bloom filter check is slower than a KDF!?!?!?!? This is so ridiculously blatantly false. Do you belive the adversary spins up a completely new Bitcoin wallet for every individual key tested!? They don't need to do any of that! They PRECOMPUTE the bloom filter once, then every test is FAST, and ALWAYS faster than the KDF! The number of hash computations done to test if a derived candidate address matches a known wallet is ABOUT A DOZEN while a slow KDF typically uses MILLIONS of hash function iterations. 
HOW can you possibly believe that a seconds slow KDF is faster than a milliseconds fast bloom filter check? We're talking about a set of addresses in active use that does not exceed some low millions, and this is INSIGNIFICANT in the pipeline. 
The ENTIRETY of the correctness check can be done in milliseconds, but a properly implemented KDF can NOT be solved that fast (see VDF:s as an extra obvious example). You'll be spending milliseconds on all steps in the pipelines EXCEPT the KDF, which is the only step that will take about a second or so in typical configurations. 
KDF computations are UNSTRIPPABLE from the pipeline, YOU CAN NOT KNOW if your guess is correct until you COMPLETED the FULL KDF computation for EACH individual candidate input.
FOR EVERY AND ALL candidate inputs in cracking attempts you compute ALL of candidate seed &gt; slow password hash / KDF &gt; ECC public key derivation &gt; address hashing &gt; bloom lookup. Perhaps 98% of the computational resources in that pipeline goes exclusively into the KDF. 
You CAN NOT bypass the need to spend CPU cycles and logic gates and memory on the KDF functions. Attempting to crack a key that uses a KDF for derivation without actually computing the KDF is a guaranteed failure. 
The adversary HAS A BUDGET!
Everything that the adversary does to speed up the KDF will let him TEST MORE ENTROPY EQUALLY FASTER!
Every resource that the adversary spends on computing the KDF 1000x faster than before will ALSO allow him to spend the same resources on more cores to test 1000x more entropy bits WITH THE AND ACCELERATION! The impact is EQUAL!
Adding 1 000x computational power has IDENTICAL effects to cracking passwords / keys / seeds regardless of if you use a KDF or not.
@_date: 2019-10-10 23:47:52
Not more than the rest of the password "decays". Unless there's algorithmic speedups against the stretching function, the linear advantage remains constant. 1000x computing speedup hits equally hard against a 1000x stretching algorithm as it does against 10 additional bits of entropy.

* on login the server send your bundle back plus a one time nonce encrypted to your token's public key, and the SSL session details is included
* the browser confirms the SSL cert details, the SSL session details (replay protection on your side, this is how MITM and phishing is blocked - it can't be the same on your end and the scammer's end), the token decrypts the keypair, decrypts the nonce, encrypts the nonce with the server SSL cert key, sends it back.

The keypair used is thanks to this process unique for every service, preserving privacy. Also note that the UX do not necessarily tell you if it is making a registration request or a login request. You're just expected to click a button on the token, it either succeeds or fails as a result.

@_date: 2017-11-08 11:08:52


Allowing news things previously disallowed would be incompatible with old nodes.
New features is implemented by making them look universally valid to old nodes, while miners running the new code can recognize and enforce the new rules.

Opinions aren't enough - all it takes is a successful rewrite of just a few blocks to doublespend, or a netsplit inducing fork to damage the network so you can short it. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 23:26:58
Because there is benefit, you just don't seem to acknowledge it. 
If blocks are always full and fees are high, why would anybody care about running a node or using it? 
@_date: 2015-08-08 20:02:33


Technically it will - but it will either create a non-reusable response exclusively for goog1e.com, or send a response you're not able to do anything meaningful with (turning you into a passive proxy for ciphertext). You can't use the response to pretend to be the user. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:12:31
Why exactly? Bitcoin is designed for node count to not matter. All those nodes do is to help distribution of blockchain data in terms of effect on the network. The physical host is pretty much irrelevant. All the individual user need is *one* trusted node.
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:09:50
No. Even with once a year blockchain settling, it is limited to a few million users.
Those effects are limited and smaller than the negatives. 
IBLT addresses latency. Also, the combination of verification and propagation both affect latency, if measured to the point where it was confirmed valid locally.

It's also about leadership. 
Most of us the want bigger blocks wants Core to be the ones to put it officially on the roadmap, rather than as now just say "maybe later, we'll see if it ever becomes necessary". 
Because the problem with that approach is that by the time they're willing to commit to it, Bitcoin might be so overloaded that by the time the community is ready to roll out the hardfork, Bitcoin might already be dying for a number of reasons. Derailed hype train from masses of users coming in and declaring it unusable due to not being able to handle the backlog of transactions, ruining the reputation of Bitcoin, or even altcoins showing up with workable scaling solutions before Bitcoin that could steal its thunder and replace it.

@_date: 2015-08-17 00:55:22
It it's absurd to believe usage will rise? 
I know how Bitcoin works internally. Addresses is managed through the script engine. LN offers no internal equivalence of scripts. Just token transfers. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:01:52
And did the flood keep it above 1MB nonstop with continously rising fees? No, the backlog wasn't that large.
Your own arguments does the exact same thing - you're ignoring the difference in scale between what has happened and what could happen. You're belittling valid arguments. Why not try to contribute to figuring out what would work? 
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:33:55
Because not wanting to wait for demand to exceed capacity is clearly irrational. You need to want to send Bitcoin into chaos by forcing thousands of transactions to expire and disappear into the void to force tons of people to simply stop using it to be sane.

They only benefits as user of a centralized LN node are speed and lower fees. Everything else is lost. 
The effort woke be extreme. Even BIP101 is manageable by home users with fiber for the next decade. 
You're comparing the wrong things - Bitcoin fill nodes isn't the end user software, just like your don't run your own mapping service or search engine, you're phone connects to a server running them. Individuals don't want to maintain these things. 
You can have privacy without full nodes, but it is somewhat harder. Separate wallets, coinjoin, payment codes / stealth addresses and much more, all that is still an option. And PIR schemes for blockchain data lookups.

Yes, and that trust will have to lie in one or more previous thorough examinations by humans assisted with various biometry analysis tools. They'd then vouch for your identity by signing your keypair. 
That's it. No automated biometric enrollment, because the computers don't know if their sensors have been hacked. They don't know if some forging method just crossed their own margin of error. 
You can require that multiple organizations all agree and that the certificates include basic biometry you can confirm yourself. Beyond that you can't do much.

About 50 million users if LN is used *exclusively* on the blockchain, and if only 2 channels are opened and closed yearly per person. IMHO it is much safer to do that monthly instead of per 6 months, so divide by 6. Then we also assume no sidechains (not that I like the architecture of sidechains at all, but anyway), no other uses like hourly timestamping of various data, no payment codes / stealth addresses (these don't work over LN), no transaction mixing like coinjoin, etc... 
Will check how they manage P2SH later. 
My argument is that we need both. (And eventually Zero-knowledge proofs, when they are ready)
@_date: 2015-08-14 16:16:21
Why take the risk of excluding users? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:16:47
No you didn't. I didn't talk about usage within LN. I talked about the very necessary transactions required to enter and exit it. 
How will P2SH scripts be enforced within LN payment channels? LN itself would require specific scripts to work, which would likely collide with most P2SH usage. You can't enforce multisignature transactions in the style of Copay and similar effectively inside LN. 
Is everything not Bitcoin a scamcoin to you? Even standard timestamping? 




Wait, what? Did you just imply that LN can only work on 1 MB blocks but not on 8 MB blocks? Or do you just not understand what you are saying? 
@_date: 2015-08-14 16:42:53

Why? Those do need nodes can get the bandwidth somewhere, via VPS or business line 
@_date: 2015-08-04 08:38:04
IBLT works for synchronized mempools, i.e. non-standard transactions and previously not propagated transactions must still be propagated together with the IBLT "diff" for the standard transactions. Most spam and bloat attacks is likely to employ non-standard or self-created and unpropagated transactions. So those extra transactions still add significantly to the propagation latency for very large blocks. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:43:59
With a decent rig, if the bandwidth requirements was in line with the average available bandwidth, if you didn't require professional lighting - then you would necessarily need to accept a margin of error large enough to allow a render to fool your system. You need extreme quality to detect the difference between a good render and reality.

Hubs can't hold back any of your funds if *you* are the endpoint of the payment channel that was established by an on-chain transaction. 
If you aren't, you're using a centralized node connected to LN.

Capitalized nodes? Protecting wealth? A non-node paper wallet does that just fine.
Most users do not benefit from running a full node unless they actively trade in high volume. Even then it's completely acceptable for multiple people to share nodes if they all can trust the same one.
Yes, we want everybody who needs a node to run one. That doesn't mean that what we see on the network has any connection to that. It's so easy to distort the numbers that we shouldn't care about the number. 
All we should care about is that the tools these people need are accessible to them (such as nodes that are easy to run).

You don't understand. 
Taking funds out of your LN payment channel or adding funds to it *requires* an on-chain transaction. This WILL happen. It MUST happen every time the hub is down for maintenance or other reasons. It MUST happen if you're going to make transactions to and from side chains. It MUST happen if you need to use P2SH functionality. Same with Counterparty transactions. It SHOULD happen for long term storage of your coins. Etc... 
1MB chains CAN NOT support more than a few million LN users at reasonable loads.

The irony. You really can't see that you're doing exactly what you accuse me of?

But you can't accept anything but strictly following the party line, and you can't tolerate disagreement. In fact, in a genuinely decentralized system designed to be free from gatekeepers, demanding the position of a gatekeeper to tell other what to do and not makes you the enemy.


I was here for years, even before XT even was announced there was blatant censorship of discussions about hardforking bigger blocks. Advocating bigger blocks was banned. You could barely discuss BIP:s about it, and couldn't link to test implementations.
It only got worse after XT.
So many regular discussions and honest questions was deleted for no good reason, just because some mod (often theymos) didn't like it. 
What you call blatant and well known propaganda is 10% actual spam and 90% regular people with a valid different opinion.
**You don't get to demand that a question is silenced just because it has been asked before, when you never have actually answered it.**
XT was never a takeover attempt. It was actual core developers, in minority, trying to persuade the others that the matter is important and needs prioritization. That was after regular open discussion was being mostly ignored for literally years.
It was met with mostly silence, and open hostility from a small group like yours, of rabid small blockers. Calling it an altcoin and saying it "wasn't Bitcoin" when it just raised a limit Satoshi himself had softforked in and said was meant to be temporary. How does the limit meant to be temporary "define" what Bitcoin is about? How is doing what was promised by the original author against what the promise of Bitcoin is? That's just pseudo-philosophical nonsense.
Edit: you're still just as wrong even if you downvote me. That button doesn't make you right, it makes you petty.

So you agree that he would need a centralized service acting on his behalf? Because he doesn't control the payment channel that the onramp has with the hub. His transactions can still be frozen/censored at will. 
And how does aliases map to addresses? Haven't checked the details on that. Would signatures be required for him to authorize a payment from his alias?

It's still true that anybody still running segwit unaware nodes can be fooled by segwit invalid blocks, and it's extra trivial to fool anybody accepting zero-confirmation transactions with a simple segwit invalid transaction.

You don't create channels per pair of users. Each person only have one channel per LN server they're connected to, the LN server handles routing of transactions between each other. So your transaction can go from you - your bank - Starbucks's bank - Starbucks (assuming the banks implement Bitcoin LN servers).
Yes you need new transactions if your channel is maxed out (its like a prepaid card that can be topped up (by being paid) but can't hit zero, and the LN servers also need capital assigned). Also if it expires (they're time limited, this prevents servers from permanently freezing your funds).
It's federated like email. In practice it's likely to have some centralizing effects due to laws, but it's still a improvement over credit cards.

I'm talking about the onramps, not LN specifically - outsourcing the payment channel itself removes all guarantees that the protocol gives you. 
Bandwidth gets cheaper over time, so does storage and CPU power. Unless you're stuck with Comcast I can't see the reason for not wanting larger blocks. 
Also, why the vision of everybody having full nodes? Only people with particular needs have any reason to run one. SPV is sufficient for most households, what full nodes offer isn't interesting for most small businesses, it just starts to make sense for medium sized businesses and up where you have larger transaction volumes and where you may need custom metrics and accounting systems. Even Satoshi expected server halls to be the default for full nodes, hence the SPV protocol being part of the whitepaper and header structure.

Your problem is that the field is far too unpredictable, too "volatile". Past history CAN NOT accurately predict the future. It just takes one attacker doing it in large scale. Just one in the whole world. You can't guarantee it won't happen.

With a system using Zero-knowledge proofs like how I imagine it, where you essentially have multiple parallel append-only data structures carrying Zero-knowledge proofs of correctness, then you could have any number of altcoins mined together with the option for atomic transactions across chains, with absolute security (not just SPV level proofs). 
Still not a tree structure at the core, but rather parallel linked lists checkpointed by a central linked list. 
In the bottom level you'd have a blockchain header that contain hashes of data structure block headers instead of raw transactions like now. Raw transactions are moved one step down in the abstractions.

So how many more utxo's does it fit? Same as before actually, there's just a bit more space now for signatures (if used), so standard segwit transactions just leaves a bit more free space for them. The 1 MB max "base blocks" / stripped blocks remain the bar for what's gets into a block.
Edit: 
ONLY witness data = signatures gets the discount that allows for up to 4 MB of it. Everything else is capped to 1 MB.
Also, swap UTXO for txin / txout to be pedantic, the argument remain unchanged.

Because it is. No single pattern can ever be long term profitable without heavy laws or other obstructions to trade, because every rational trader will update their own economic modeling after it in their trade, and thus increasing arbitrage and removing the margin between demand and supply. Profits in trading only come from arbitrage, built on such margins. Finding something below expected market value. If the entire market knows the expected value, nothing will ever be sold under market value (with few exceptions), eliminating the possibility to profit off arbitrage.
So in less words, as soon as a pattern is found profitable it will stop being profitable when the market learns about it. The majority of perceived patterns are just mirages.

Eh? When have I claimed to be a money laundering expert? 
And by the way, in the legal system crimes are defined as what's not legally allowed. If red pants are banned, wearing them WOULD be a crime. 
Money laundering is a crime because the act of moving money around to hide the source has commonly been used to hide other crimes, such as theft and tax evasion and drug dealing. See for example restaurants - illegally earned money is funneled into a business that otherwise appear legal, and then back to the criminals in the appearance of wages or fees or various payments for services. 
To get around having to spend months gathering evidence for involvement in the original crime, the act of covering the source was illegalized. Certain methods of moving money is automatically classified as money laundering to simplify it all further.

That 128 bit value is vulnerable to birthday paradox bruteforce leading to a 2^64 operations attack being viable.
The attack don't need to happen in one month (it is effectively infinitely reusable), using GPUs would reduce cost already by multiple orders of magnitude, ASICs way way more. And again, they ignore batching (attacking thousands of pairs of users simultaneously) and software optimizations. So take away 3-5 zeroes from the cost. And that cost will fall continously. In 10 years it will probably have halved several times too. The modern hardware is also more efficient, so electricity costs will be lower as well. 
What's more, you neither have to do it in one month or halt their conversations during the attack - you just have to make them both initiate a chat, then you drop out temporarily and run the entire attack offline. When it has completed, you can MITM them at will.

Wrong. RBF hasn't been used in the past, but that has not stopped doublespends. Non-RBF simply DOES NOT prevent doublespends. It simply does not add security.
The 95% "guarantee" is actually closer to 20% once your attacker makes an effort (see for example Peter Todd's doublespend toolbox).
The only thing RBF does is to make it more obvious while adding new transaction strategies.

Can you really only see *one and exactly one* externality from high fees and maxed blocks? High fees because of competition to get into blocks will make everything else but Bitcoin more attractive, it will make donations meaningless over Bitcoin, will kill small transactions, etc... It will be blocked from growth, and will be blocked from getting established through network effects. 
You're the one who lack evidence. You're thinking about the node count drop which *actually* depends on SPV wallets being recommended above Core, mobile wallets replacing desktop wallets, lack of interest, changed metrics (switching from counting firewalled nodes to not count them), lack of necessity, etc... Not to mention that Satoshi himself expected to see server halls being used for dedicated nodes! 
The math clearly shows that at least 8MB blocks will have a nearly indistinguishable effect on the network (for nodes with fiber rather than crappy ancient DSL!), and won't be disruptive today. As technology improves, even bigger blocks will be practical. The centralizing effects you claim to see depends on absolutely everything else than what you say it does. There's a very insignificant number of people with the capability of contributing (unfirewalled and non-NAT'ed Internet port) that are limited by not affording the hardware or connection. 
Not to mention that the only node count that matters for decentralization is your own - every node you see in the network besides yours is effectively equivalent from your view. Adding a full node only adds another relay path if you do nothing else. If you don't watch for forks, don't connect your wallet clients to it, if you don't back it with your reputation so those who trust you can connect to it, then you add *nothing* but a relay path. And that's not what decentralization is about, and you will have missed the point by lightyears.

Which last one? How do you know which was last? What outputs signs off? Your own receiving change addresses signs the transaction that no longer includes those change addresses, just to get the network to propagate the transaction? That's impractical overhead. 
Full RBF just asks for higher fee. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:31:59
It literally is.
You believe something works in a particular way based on observing only a subset of the relevant information. 
The very act of relying on zero-conf incentivizes attack, thus it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
The default client behavior should be changed exactly because of that reason, insinuating it is trustable is how you cause losses. Doublespends are easy enough already - RBF only drops the charade. There's no sabotage - RBF only makes the behavior more predictable, those who already want to doublespend can do it easily enough *today*. Sabotage implies making things substantially worse, but it doesn't. 
Your reactive security mindset is harmful, because you don't want to address risks until there's been enough damage, proactive security measures is what is required to prevent failure and to prevent losses.

How much do I need to prove? I2P already makes it easy to create many independent anonymous tunnels, it is absolutely super trivial to implement the multisig part on the server (see Coinbase, Copay, Coinkite and more).

Then why are you doing the same?
You limit my freedom to correct transactions not yet confirmed, you limit my freedom to merge and append payments, you limit my freedom to not have to chain unconfirmed transactions to spend money twice in a row with the risk of the second one getting invalidated (malleability, etc), you limit my freedom to deploy scorched earth against those who doublespend despite the lack of RBF (because lack of RBF does in no way protect against doublespends). 
You don't realize your own hypocrisy.
You limit one large category of freedoms to protect a smaller and less secure one. Who are you to say that the only long term reliable policy is to be blocked?

And when people have steered away from it, we'll be stuck with an absolutely useless policy. Are you happy then? We don't be able to for example amend one transaction to make multiple payments by adding UTXO's and altering the change transaction (the latter of which is impossible without full RBF), reducing overhead in number of created UTXO's and signatures, etc.

Bitcoin relies on a protocol. Your node behave in one way, and collectively the network behaves in a way in response to it that is useful to you. 
Your idea is different. Your idea is built on having other people run software that FORCE their nodes to react in one way - but in Bitcoin they only comply because they actually want to (they agree with the rules of the protocol and would be ignored if they break it). Each transaction is itself a proof of the protocol being followed. Each block is a proof of it being followed. The PoW in the block headers is easy to verify. That's what makes Bitcoin possible.
You don't have Bitcoins because your computer says so - you have them because everybody else agrees that the greatest-PoW blockchain says you do. 
Enforced client side behavior is DRM, and that's actually even mathematically proven to be impossible to make fully secure. Indistinguishable obfuscation is proven to be theoretical upper limit on the capabilities and strength of it, and even that's not proven possible to achieve.

Ignoring actual real life risk is how you screw shit up for yourself. There's nothing unfounded about it just because it didn't happen.

The fee market must be independent of block size short term. It just has to. It will be uprooted anyway eventually and forced to start over. With changing fee:subsidy ratios and the eventual larger blocks and Lightning Network, the dynamics will change. It makes no long term difference to force the establishment of a fee market now. 
Also, fees are higher than zero already. Miners can set any lower boundary they want, and see if people accept it. And they already do, in fact. Your fee level determines how fast your transactions gets processed, simple as that.

Also, please clarify what you mean by trustless. The ability to verify the whole blockchain on your Nokia 3310? Trustlessness means mathematical verifiability, not limited resource use. Do you think SPV wallets violate trustlessness? 
So what *was* you talking about regarding the decentralization? 
Lol no. That's just an argument against the "this is what Bitcoin was meant to be" crowd,and the status quo embracers. Satoshi wasn't perfect, but he was a genius. There's so many things he predicted accurately that his intelligence is undeniable. But as I said, he wasn't perfect, there's things he got wrong too. But this is not one of those things. 
There's a reason SPV mode was described in the whitepaper, a reason why he used Merkle tree hashes in the blockchain headers. Most clients would eventually not have the full blockchain data. He designed the system to support that outcome.

You can replace transactions that have errors. It can be used in various smart contact schemes.

Most unsuccessful attempts weren't very thought through. The big ones exploited differing relay policies, direct contact with colluding miners, typically with goods that are easy to resell so that even a 1/10 success rate is profitable, etc... 
If you let the poorly implemented attempts guide your assumptions on what will happen in the future (hint: even more varying relay policies, varying inclusion policies and dissemination of knowledge on how to implement the attacks), then you will lose money.
The individual sellers might not even be able to tolerate a single doublespend if they have low margins. You can't trust zero-conf. Bitcoin by design doesn't care about Sybil attacks (many fake nodes), only proof-of-work.

Insecure zero-conf doesn't sound like a must have. 
The ability to merge transactions does sound necessary for those who wants to exchange fiat for Bitcoins and instantly start spending at multiple locations, which normally would force them to chain together multiple unconfirmed transactions. This would enable merging them into one. Extremely relevant for practically every poor area in the world where one doesn't always have a stash of Bitcoins with multiple UTXO's ready to spend.
You're the one limiting functionality, because zero-conf has functional alternatives, the features I mentioned for RBF *does not* have functional alternatives. We don't lose anything crucial by adopting RBF, but gain other useful features. 
Zero-conf can't ever be secure anyway on its own, so I don't understand why you defend relying on it for instant and valuable transactions. It just don't make sense. If your customer is capable of doublespending you TODAY and run off, unaccountable, then what? Why expose yourself to that? RBF doesn't even increase the chance of success that much - it is already at something like 95%, those last 5% doesn't really matter. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:50:45
Which part of my reliance on real world facts is dishonest? Please explain. 
Going from 98% to 99% failure rate during attack isn't sabotage. Sabotage is to cause what otherwise wouldn't happen or make the harm worse. 
Meanwhile you won't acknowledge roadblocking useful features like merging transactions.
It isn't the 1% reduction of security that's intended to change behavior to the better. It is the elimination of the fake charade that is supposed to do that. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 17:18:19

The notary does not need to know more than the blockchain otherwise would  reveal - you don't need to reveal anything other than your individual public keys to the notary, not revealing the link. Why do they need to know which address is which? Register every public key independently to create notarized P2SH addresses. Your signature for each address is the authorization for that address. 
FSS RBF is not the only other option to zero-conf, you'd be the dishonest one to claim so. The FSS version don't enable corrections or transaction merging (if your transaction had a change output, so almost always), only adding fees. 
Going from no RBF or FSS RBF with 95% success rate for an attacker to FSU RBF with 99.9% success rate and getting the merging option is more than worth it. You're the dishonest one to pretend the success rate TODAY isn't incredibly high. I don't understand why zero-conf is so important to you. Why do you defend using it with unidentified customers?
What part of accurately assessing risk is dishonest? What part of valuation based on objective metrics is dishonest? What part of accurate representation of how things work is dishonest?
Your arguments are emotional, but you present them as factual and objective. That's practically the definition of intellectual dishonesty.

Except that enough miners will allow it that you'll get forked off into a minority fork. RBF isn't a dangerous weapon - it has legitimate uses, and it is those who demand that zero-conf will be secure that is irresponsible. 
After all, if it was possible to know certain which transaction is the doublespend before they go into any block, then why do you need Bitcoin at all? Why have mining if you can establish concensus without it? If you can say which block that should be orphaned, why do you even need to create blocks out of the transactions? 
Non-RBF doesn't reward anything more than RBF does.

Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange. ECDH(P_a, Q_b) = ECDH(P_b, Q_a) = derived shared key. That key is used for symmetric encryption. 
If this used encryption, why would the value be identical on both ends without communicating anything but their respective public keys? Why is there no input field? 
In RSA the operation for encryption and signing is the same, the math is identical. Same with decryption and verification. You enter raw data which is scrambled in a way that can be unscrambled. Not so with ECC.

+1, this is approximately what I have in mind. My idea is to have defined channels, like subs or email lists. Each one has its official moderators and admins. Each post can be submitted to multiple channels and even declare which channels it is in. Each user selects the channels he like. Cross posting between channels works just like CC:ing another email list in an email submission. A channel goes bad? Import everything you want to keep to the good channels, and carry on as if nothing happened. Creating your own channel wood be trivial, just pick a default delivery and communication mechanism (the standard would likely be a using server, but pure P2P methods would be possible) and launch it. 
please take a look!
FYI, for votes my only plausible solution so far is vote aggregation services, kind of like Facebook's thumbs up or Google Plus' +1. You'd have an account at one and declare which submissions you like. You'd see what others on the same servers like.

If you print a paper wallet you see it. Otherwise the software automates it all for you. 
Any wallet that recreates the private keys and addresses from your backup seed with the same method will work perfectly fine. There's multiple wallets using the same standard method, and the specifications are all public. Anybody can reimplement the code to do it.
Remember that anybody who ever have had access to your private keys or backups (without encryption, or who can guess your password) can access your funds and steal them. Protect your backups the way you'd protect your banking passwords or gold or stock certificates. Keep them secret, do not share photos of them.
Compromised wallets must be replaced. You may keep the old backups around, but stop using them if you believe somebody else got access to them.

How explicit do I need to be? LN don't even use Bitcoin addresses internally to identify payment channels. There's no way to enforce that 3 of 4 of my addresses needs to sign my transactions inside an LN payment channel. You're only talking about the ability to fund payment channels and withdraw from payment channels to and from any kind of address. That's irrelevant to the question. *Inside* LN there only exists funds in your payment channel. 
The only way to enforce logic like multisignature transactions there is server side in the hub, not in the client. You can't enforce behavior like that funds only can be spent after x amount of time by yourself. You can't use multisignature oracles. The scripting feature is entirely unavailable when inside LN.

I'm thinking of how to do it efficiently.

Because today it is hard to consistently quickly get a hold off the goods before anybody can tell you doublespent. With more merchants it won't be. 
Merchants can use zero-conf just fine even with RBF for as long as the ability to revoke / undo the purchase remains without any notable loss of value (like a VPN, or online purchase where delivery can be canceled), because then zero-conf just means "we've seen your promise to pay, we're proceeding until further notice". No doublespend = no notice, delivery made as agreed. 
Just **update your risk profile**. And for that we'll get multiple useful strategies in return.

It was used in a particular context, presented to the same group of cryptographers that previously had been involved in digital cash schemes like Chaum's (blinded tokens), which involved issuing banks and redeeming banks. The cash-like property is that the users are the ones that decide what to do with the value tokens, not the bank (after being *asked* by clients to do X with the money). 
It doesn't care *how* this is achieved. Lightning Network is perfectly in line with that vision. Being unable to use raw Bitcoin transactions for small value transactions is no problem if second layer solutions still enable it.

Everyone knew smartphones would be ubiquitous too back in 2000, right? Everyone was just waiting for PDA:s to get high resolution multitouch screens, cellular radio and more storage, right? Nope. They were mostly seen as toys. 
Just because I wanted them and was thrilled by portable computers with touchscreens, that didn't mean that back then it was certain that it would happen. PDAs could have died out, the form factor could have changed, fast mobile Internet could have gone without the R&amp;D necessary to make it usable, they could have been laughed out, developer support could have been zero, energy efficiency could have remained crap, usability could have remained crap, etc... Although I spotted the trend back in the days of the Palm PDA:s and the Sony Ericsson P810i, that didn't mean I was going to be right in my predictions about what we would end up using. My guess back then that we would be using Internet connected software with dynamic touch based user interfaces with just the buttons needed in custom layouts could have turned out wrong. There were tons of necessary developments that was still in the future.

1MB high transaction capacity trustless blockchain. Lightning Network requires larger blocks for a large user base. Only ZKP is capable of providing secure block data compression. Anything else run force a limitation on the transaction count that is so strict that Bitcoin will be forgotten.
Trust in what? Who's trust? Under what circumstances? 
SPV mining is outright stupid, yes. So why not focus on optimization? Also, again, ZKP would make it secure even with minimal computational power. 
The mining network is getting more decentralized over time, actually. Were you even here when the first ASICs arrived or when GHash was feared? Also, large open pools are at risk of block withholding attacks, reducing profitability. Small closed pools is more secure and thus more strongly incentivized. 
Many of the 1MB-for-life supporters share the same reasoning. Your arguments reminded me heavily of them. I've also seen many of these claim "the original vision of Bitcoin" as their support, which is provably wrong. They overlap with the anti-ASIC / pro-scrypt crowd and the PoS fanboys. They keep fixating themselves at weak hardware, node count, bad connections, etc, and fully expecting that to be the ONLY thing, exclusively, which the entire global financial network will be built on. Just so their box at home can be fully equal with all other nodes globally. Not understanding that this is physically impossible.

They can offer it for customers they could identify, for accountability. Or when there's multisignature notaries used. 
The primary argument from me is that when you have a specific reason to trust the customer, you can use it. But usually you won't - and no amount of history of success is relevant if the situation changes! 
Past value does you no good whatsoever when the attackers changes focus. 
RBF enables correcting transactions with errors, or enables replacing change outputs in order to chain together / merge multiple payments, it fixes the expectations of what the network does.

1) you can find bugs in the spec. 
This allows planning for defenses, like when Bitcoin was new and insecure op codes was disabled by a softfork. 
2) you can find bugs in the surrounding code. Like networking code, etc. 
By the way, this is how the Bitcoin developers found bugs in the OpenSSL secp256k1 code! They implemented it themselves and found edge cases that OpenSSL failed on, sometimes insecurely! 
By the anti-reimplementation policy, that would have been the wrong thing to do. 
3) you can optimize for different hardware platforms. 
4) you can optimize for different uses (point of sale, exchanges, etc). 
5) you can offer third party features on top, like additional indexes and various API:s. 
6) you can implement it in different languages like Rust. This can even help you make sure the implementation is privacy preserving and secure, etc. 
And so on.
And by the time the community agrees in changing the spec, having a well defined one allows you to much more easily make the change without bugs.

I don't see how your irrelevant retort proves anything wrong. 
If nobody's in charge of a codebase, how does it get compiled into a single binary for everybody to use? 
The decentralization comes from the users having the ability to chose what client to run. 
You really think Core doesn't have any kind of governance? Do you think just anybody can claim to represent Core and distribute a client under that name? Hearn didn't expect to control Bitcoin. He just hoped people would agree in the need for scaling and use a client that actually implemented increased capacity. It didn't have to be XT.

The stability of a flawed proposition does not offer value. 
You also haven't explained the value proposition. 
I can guarantee you that the majority of Bitcoin investments comes not from what it is today, but from what people expect it to become. People anticipating LN, larger blocks, broad adoption, smart contracts, etc. Simultaneously.

So you want a single point of failure? Multiple compatible implementations is actually a good idea, once you have a solid specification. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:39:19
The blocks that segwit invalidates are those that follow the current rules *in a non-standard way never before seen used*, and such transactions or blocks won't be constructed by any known software. What's more is that such usage of the rules is explicitly defined as non-standard in the software, and won't be propagated by standard nodes in the network. 
So basically to get a hardfork you need a non-segwit aware miner to mine a non-standard segwit-invalid transaction, and a non-segwit aware client to see and accept the block. 
Standard non-segwit transactions ARE still segwit-valid. No hardfork there. Standard non-segwit aware miners can mine normally in a segwit active chain. The standard non-segwit blocks will be accepted by segwit miners, and standard non-segwit miners will accept segwit blocks since the transactions are all valid (despite being pre-segwit non-standard).
The worst risk is for clients that aren't aware of segwit (although you do not need to explicitly support it!).
Segwit is not a hardfork. No old nodes are kicked out. They don't need to change. 
They only need to add segwit awareness to perform *full validation* post-segwit. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 16:45:17
That's not really how things went back when XT was being proposed, etc... It was compatible and designed to remain compatible, except for that it also had a threshold for when to activate a proposed incompatible hardfork. 
And the entire point was to *discuss, test and try to agree on* this proposal. Which would require the awareness of the community and help in development and testing. 
But instead it was labeled an altcoin and actively fought, discussions about it was banned, etc... 
How do you suggest that one proposes a hardfork if they don't get to demonstrate how it would work, don't get to ask for help in development or testing, can't promote it to the community, and only can talk about protocol details which most people won't understand?
Any kind of BIP for a hardfork could just as easily be rejected by status-quo extremists by shouting "hasn't been tested", "no consensus", etc, just like now.

Uh huh. Want me to send you a primer on *asteroid mining*? Because there's one of those passing by Earth soon that a ton of engineers want to take the chance of mining on. 
Fact is that gold has been scarce for millenia and will most likely remain economically scarce due to the cost of mining for the foreseeable future. Meaning many decades. Just energy costs alone won't be trivial. 
Nevertheless, all this is just sidetracking (by you) from the real arguments.
A not insignificant cost to acquire something makes it economically scarce. Gold is scarce. Bitcoin is scarce. Anything NOT scarce will never be a good investment since it never will be highly valuable, because anybody can trivially get more.

1) Showstopping bugs like the Sparc processor subsidy schedule restart bug and the billion bitcoins overflow bug needs to be weeded out of the spec.
Preserving them will kill Bitcoin. Concensus breaking bugs and unintended behavior has been blocked many times before in various updates. A lot of these could have been exploited in transactions that would necessarily not be allowed to exist in the mainline Bitcoin blockchain. 
2) forgot to mention that the OpenSSL code also had potential concensus breaking bugs (mostly across different OS implementations). Meaning that even a fix necessarily would conflict with SOME clients, if a malicious signature was encountered in the blockchain. 
Fortunately it was fixed before that ever happened. 
4-5) so what? They're arguments for multiple implementations
Showing that you forgot very important real-world arguments for it is showing that you're avoiding reality more than me. Starting from scratch in new environments is the best way to find bugs in specs. Otherwise you get tunnel vision.

You're constantly saying Bitcoin has no value without it. Why are you saying that then? 
They've been told it is safe. 
When the number of merchants and the potential value of the goods increase, more people will try. The incentive grows with usage. You seem to think it doesn't. 


And yet you're saying lots of people will doublespend with RBF - and thus risk jail time. How's it gonna be? 
Merging multiple transactions to reduce overhead, allowing you to not have to chain unconfirmed transactions when you just spent your largest UTXO and your change is unconfirmed and thus appending to the original transaction instead (malleability protection), enabling quick corrections, etc... 
And that's what you get in exchange for just having to make sure your customer is known to you (legally accountable, can be sued), or to use lightning network / Stroem or multisignature notaries like Greenaddress.it and bitgo. How's that not a better tradeoff?

Absolutely is. Because that majority will split the system into two, yours and their own.
If you're telling me that decentralized means you can make decisions that they have to follow, then you're objectively wrong. That's requires a hierarchical governance system, which is in conflict with decentralization.

Majority vote winning IS EXACTLY WHAT DECENTRALIZED MEANS! It means that EVERYBODY who wants to do things differently CAN do things differently, and the majority who wants different rules ARE ALLOWED to use their new different rules together independently of what anybody else says! 
The only thing different from centralized democracy is that the losing minority IS NOT forced to abandon their previous system, but that the system is allowed to fork! 
The old minority and the new majority can BOTH use their own separate rules!
Only centralization can stop people from using their own custom rules!

Because it matters? It helps one understand what the true incentives and effects of the system are. It prevents you from staring yourself blind at what things are like now, by looking at what it could be. 
If another setup would have been better, and if it still is achievable and would be am improvement, shouldn't we try to achieve it? 
And why should we not try to figure out if there's something else that is better?

And you do. You look at successful transactions in the past - but ignore the technical reasons and the incentives that will cause it to fail. 
You're forecasting against what's essentially a random oracle. Meaningless and futile. Your data is insufficient. 
You find it uncomfortable to use multisignature notaries or wait it identify the customers, so YOU want to override my choice to merge multiple transactions, increase fees during high network load and to make corrections to my unconfirmed transactions. 
Your realized value is the lesser one, your inconvenience when changing is the lesser one, your experienced negative change is the lesser one, your risks are the greater ones. 
There's no dishonesty whatsoever in acknowledging the truth - doublespends are easy, stopping RBF offers zero protection. The per-attempt risk of loss barely changes, that's a proven fact! The change in vulnerability is miniscule. That's like throwing a banana peel on a muddy icy path. Ridiculous claim. 
The security barely changes - but the appearance of security vanishes! 
In return we get actual security, lower risks and massively beneficial features (high activity poor users gets lower fees from merging transactions, and don't need to chain unconfirmed transactions). 
You will not even acknowledge being a roadblock to such useful features, and you do not acknowledge the real world risk. Meanwhile you're being a central planner by deciding that one poor strategy with plenty of options is worth more to ***everybody*** than actual irreplaceable features.

Where is it? 
Bitcoin's libconcencus is only an attempt at codifying what exactly it is in Bitcoin that can affect interpretation of the blockchain. 
There is no formal specification. There's no complete documentation. There's is only the Bitcoin Core code today, which the developers are trying to create a specification around. 
Code alone is not a specification. Doesn't even matter if you call it a reference implementation. If I'm not told how to be certain that my reimplementation in another language is correct then I can't be sure I'm preserving concensus. 
Just look at that old SPARC Solaris subsidy bug that prompted the developers to joke about making Bitcoin deflationary instead of inflationary (because the code would loop after a given number of blocks on SPARC, causing the subsidy schedule to restart). 
And the BIP66 forking bug. 
And that old counter overflow bug that allowed somebody to claim billions of Bitcoins back in the day (promptly rolled back).
Bitcoin Core all by itself has been incompatible with itself and its own stated goals on occasion. You think it is already perfect? 
Also, to keep calling anything interested in changing the rules "hostile takeovers" is pretty inflammatory and counterproductive. You probably already know that today's Bitcoin don't be ideal in 20 years from now. Things will need to change one day, and Bitcoin is defined by its users. It isn't hostile if everybody wants it.

You don't have to include anything not yet proven to be the best or optimal or necessary.

Isn't it obvious? I thought it was already written out explicitly enough in the text. 
Major factor DOES NOT equal GIVES value. 
It ENABLES value. 
Your car engine ENABLES your car to run. It can't do so alone! It needs fuel and more to do it. Take away the engine and it can't run. 
Every necessary factor ENABLES value when present. Capacity ENABLES value. It doesn't give value. 
Value comes from demand when every prerequisite already has been filled. Capacity is a prerequisite. 
People *wouldn't* value Bitcoin *because* it can handle many transactions. Instead it *doesn't lose value* in the perception of the users when it *doesn't fail* at handling many transactions. The value is dependent on what it does well, and high capacity makes it *not bad* at it.

@_date: 2015-07-24 18:17:45
But that breaking you're talking about is already fixed. 
1) multisig notary 
2) legal identification of customer so thieves can be sued / prosecuted 
3) make sure you don't irreversibly deliver (and thus lose control of) valuable goods before confirmation 
4) only accept it for low value transactions, stop accepting them after X doublespend attempts in time period Y. 
Then you need to remember that doublespends already can be trivially profitable. You don't know which customers planned to doublespend. 
It is when you do neither of those points above are true that you're at risk. The problem is that most uses (in volume) of zero-conf violates all points above. 
Zero-conf isn't feasible. Not of you violate the points above. Zero-conf is functionally equal to credit payments. If you normally wouldn't grant that person credit, don't accept his zero-conf. Miners shouldn't be making any guarantees, they don't know enough to guarantee anything.

@_date: 2015-07-01 05:30:14
But there's very limited long term reward, high long term risk and other policy choices that over the long term will be more beneficial than the risky behavior. 
If we reverse the position, who are you to say I'm not to use RBF? What if that had been default policy and you were the one trying to change the relay policy, knowing that it won't add real security? You'd have been the one taking away a useful option to add a useless one.
Having RBF as a policy doesn't automatically put you under attack - require ID or use of multisignature notaries to accept zero-conf, or require at least one confirmation. Done! You're now protected.
Expecting zero-conf to always work will however still expose you to attack, as soon as somebody colludes with a malicious miner. 
RBF keeps people from getting screwed, the default policy with zero-conf doesn't.

@_date: 2015-07-24 10:52:15
I know it isn't. But the fraction of use cases where zero-conf is acceptably secure DO NOT overlap with those it is promoted for. If you can neither identify the customer and bring him to court, or revoke your services, or claim back your goods, and if they're moderately high value, then why are using it? The laughably small probability of success you have against an attacker isn't valuable enough or even meaningful to protect. In particularly not when the option you're blocking is the ability to merge multiple transactions, corrections and more.

How will what work itself out? 
You clearly haven't thought through that argument. 
1) we have sufficient proof already that it already has been broken. 
2) so now we just added overhead. Without adding security, don't forget that. The doublespends we have today will still work with that scheme in place. So we gained what exactly? Child-pays-for-parent is likely to be more efficient in half the cases or more, and it doesn't even change the transaction format.

Basically anybody. Whoever has the motive and chance to get away. It is possible already today, just not profitable enough to put it to test yet. But it will be eventually. 
You're severely underestimating the ability to automate the attacks. Software keys, underpriced shady resellers (when you get a buyer, you in turn buy the thing requested and attempts to doublespend), coordinating thieves, exchanges that take zero-conf, gambling sites, etc... 
The ease of pulling off doublespends even in B&amp;M today is too great already. Telling them it is safe will one day be what causes a wave of doublespend attempts, of which many will succeed. You're putting your gold stash in a wooden box with the reasoning that it hasn't failed *yet*. 
Bitcoin offers more than proof of transaction to the merchant. It proves there's no hyperinflation, etc... And you don't necessarily trust the buyer's boss to give him non-counterfeit money, so even if your buyer is honest you want to make sure the money is real. There's many benefits of it.

What matters is that we can be sure that the protocol is followed correctly and that we can access the network.

Your words, not mine. I challenge you to find anything I've said to back your claim. You can't seem to refute anything I'm saying without strawmen. 
What gives it value is demand + scarcity (supply). Demand comes from perceived utility, and transaction capacity is a MAJOR factor in utility. Too low capacity kills utility (because fees and latency will skyrocket, eliminating large classes of usecases), no utility means no demand, no demand means no value! 
Now why don't you tell me what YOU think the value comes from?
I was literally repeating YOUR contradictions. Your words rephrased. You said that's how it is yourself. I made no claim about how the world works in those sentences, you did.

Funny how the mailing list archives literally proves you totally wrong. It's right there in cleartext, and you can look it up yourself like I just did (just searched my inbox from the mail from that time, when I was following those discussions). 
Literally several developers and many others supported larger blocks (and still does), the problem was that there's wasn't strong agreement *for any one single proposal*. Very few people opposed block size increases as a concept, and most opposition was because they wanted to make sure the risks was better understood first before implementing it.
You're still failing to explain why you're an enemy of Bitcoin if you want it to scale better with practical means. You're failing to prove it would kill decentralization. 
Not even lightning network can help it scale enough to handle millions of active users, unless we can softfork in Zero-knowledge proofs in extension blocks (which is literally our ONLY way out without hardforks). But we still don't have Zero-knowledge proofs that are both fast, compact AND known to be secure.

Extension blocks can go the OG Zerocoin way of having a central "deposit address" that's an anyone-can-spend address, with miners enforcing the rules for coin movement across main blockchain and extension blocks.

You're telling Bitcoin will survive by being used only by people ***who already don't need it***, because they already have their investments ready. Like owning stock internationally, owning valuable art located in ship docks around the world for easy access, owning more art located in vaults, etc... 
And you're telling me indirectly that these few people who you expect to be the only users will fund all the mining themselves that is required to prevent a would-be attacker from stealing from them through a 51% block orphaning attack. Who would mine it when the capacity for transactions are so low it is hard to sell your profits? And when there's so few users that it barely can find a buyer? 
You don't understand psychology or basically anything else. You don't understand why people value Bitcoin.

Uh huh. They sure know EVERYBODY'S requirements perfectly? They can never know less about any particular usecase than anybody else? The knowledge of everybody else is strictly a subset of the knowledge of the developers?

So you will happily make Bitcoin unusable for average people just to make Bitcoin work for those who DON'T need it? 


And you're telling me I don't understand economics? You who happily ignores the fact that thousands of billion dollar companies have collapsed when they got reevaluated by the market? "Buy the rumors, sell the news". You're seriously telling me that the majority of Bitcoin owners expects to be using it in its current unmodified form for the foreseeable future? 


While a necessary feature to be functional, it was intended to work as cash. It was supposed to be usable by ordinary people. 


Except for basic economics and psychology and facts about how Bitcoin was presented to the world and its design, etc. But if course that doesn't matter, it was once called digital gold and that means you're the expert, right? You're pretty ridiculous for believing you understand how the market is valuing Bitcoin better than people who understand it far better than you do. 


Most people who would consider to replace gold for Bitcoin does not need to replace gold. You're literally telling me you're aiming for a niche where Bitcoin can't compete, because the majority of the people who would use it doesn't need it. At best Bitcoin can be cheaper for them, but everybody who isn't them would stop mining if they don't pay enough fees. Which means this group of would-be gold traders would have to become Bitcoin miners and mine enough to defend themselves from 51% attacks. 
You're also forgetting how gold won its niche - it had no competitors. Try looking up that NPR article / podcast on the history of gold. Nothing else was both as scarce, as easy to verify, as easy to divide, as well known, and so on. Plus it looks fancy. 
The more people that use Bitcoin, the more uses it has, the more people it is that share the burden of funding mining via the fees. 
Bitcoin has competition from every piece of software that can offer the same functionality. You're blind if you think otherwise. 
The only people for which Bitcoin has no competition are those for which there currently are no good solution for managing their funds or trades. The people who has no defense against inflation, the people who don't have access to the banking system. The people who have no good way to establish trust in their trades. 
But these people are exactly the ones you you're telling me you DON'T want to use Bitcoin! 
The people above who you said should use it all DOES NOT NEED the unique features that Bitcoin offers. They don't care its unique - to them it's not very competitive!

My own country hasn't been involved much in war (Sweden). But yes, I understand the basics of the psychology of the situation. But keep in mind that most of the refugees also don't move very far, the majority emigrates to neighboring countries. And far from everybody are hostile towards their new host countries (at least in our country). Much of the cultural effect of immigration is overstated (I can back this up with studies if you wish), and if such a large majority were willing to commit violence in retaliation then we would already have had a WW3 going decades ago. Most people settle down quick when their lives are stable, regardless of past experience.

10k from that "horde" you were talking about.
You definitely need to work on your math skills.
1: Those numbers are where SOME action was taken. These people aren't even all deported / refused! Some of them are admitted after seeking asylum or otherwise getting legal status.
2: Those numbers aren't even all people who arrive by land. Many of them would be unaffected by a wall. Like the people arriving by plane and overstaying.
3: The relevant number is how many are getting through, number of arrests isn't even interesting. The wall CAN NOT be worth the effort if the improved numbers in people kept out isn't worth the money. If you pay MORE per person kept out than for other options, it's bad business. You can't show numbers that are relevant for any kind of wall. 
4: here's some useful numbers
When entry by land doesn't even represent a simply majority (50%) of source of illegal immigrants, why does a wall even matter? 


You still don't think race motivated action is racist?




More proof you don't understand the complexities of the real world. Mexico isn't simply offering "free food". It's still a trade-off. You're basically saying anybody with poor neighboring countries are screwed, and that's fine by you.

If the LN server stops signing you can't use the LN network via that server anymore. It's the same effect as if they shut down. The timelock is an instruction in the Bitcoin transaction's script that says "after time X you can do Y". The lightning network funding script says "before time X both the user and the server needs to sign to withdraw, after that only the user needs to sign" - this is also why you're expected to settle the channel before expiration.
The settlement transaction is what you're updating. Separate from the commitment / deposit transaction. It's rather a template for it, kind of. Or like using a bank check as a "bar tab". It's a valid transaction, but not *intended* to be put on the blockchain. You're supposed to work with the server to create a final settlement transaction separately, that "template" is a *backup* if one side disappears or stop cooperating. If the other side bolts, you publish that transaction anyway to get your funds.
Everything but the commitment and settlement is off chain.

It's still the pigeon hole argument - if some strings can be compressed, others MUST become larger after processing, otherwise you can not compress *any* file.
If 11 becomes 11111, what decompresses into 11?
Even if talking about encoding as digits of Pi, the same must apply.
Compression typically works because non-compressible files are rare to encounter, because we tend to work with strings full of patterns.
Also, even offsets *are* a form of instruction. Just very low complexity.

You need to pay attention.
There's massive active efforts in USA to reduce regulation, reduce legal obligations on corporations, to reduce taxes, to privatize more (roads, healthcare, etc), to cut down on social programs. And they're happening *now*. 
That's not compatible with centrism, because being center means you're in the *middle* between for example right wing economic conservatism and welfare spending, in the middle between heavy and light regulation, etc. You're far right, and the few things that stands out in the other direction is your last administration's attempt at fixing healthcare.
But no, the mere existence of social services and healthcare insurance doesn't make you center.
I don't think it's wise to use my citizenship as an insult. We've literally not had an official government for the last 124 days (just a provisional one) and yet it *still* works better than yours right now. We passed a budget without a government previously and the parties have now finally agreed to break the stalemate and to cooperate across the political spectrum to form a government, to avoid and *actual* crisis. 
And yours... rejects a budget that funds everything but the wall, one which the Republican senate otherwise already approved, with a provision for negotiating the terms for a wall budget separately.
I don't actually care much about how all the necessities are provided for. I'm not a ideological zealot. What I want is for people to take responsibility and realize that cooperation is the best choice. The particular form doesn't matter as much.

Same style as what? And based on what? Just looking internally, even with all the heated rhetoric between our political parties they're actually willing to collaborate. Our largest left wing party + green party is collaborating with the center (actually free-market right wing) and liberals (center-right). The sane ones here are willing to acknowledge our faults too, but despite the old "jantelag" we can still also acknowledge what's right. We want things to be right, many of us too have different ideas on what right, but we're willing to discuss our opinions honestly, we're willing to negotiate and compromise. We're also not slow to point out flaws, regardless of where they are. 
And as for those of us participating in discussions online, if you disregard our own branch of alt-right morons (nationalists who don't even know what our national culture is), it's usually a bit more sensible. 
However, if you've been on you'll have seen English speaking people show up spouting bullshit about things like crime statistics, where their numbers usually are wrong, and where their own countries *almost always* are worse (also, surprise, they forgot to compare the statistics before deciding *our* stats looks bad). And this is statistically the case simply because we are objectively highly ranked in most international rankings of things that matter (quality of life, etc). Having to deal with that kind of trolls is the major reason for why you'll see swedes acting arrogant, because it's easier (although not ideal) when you keep encountering lies and bullshit to simply dismiss them. 
Pewdiepie is basically spending most his time exaggerating and meming. He's mocking all sides simultaneously. He both mocks the minority of swedes that are like that, *and* mocks the idiots that thinks the stereotype applies to the whole country. He doesn't seem to associate with any particular ideology, from my interpretation because he doesn't like tribalism and don't want to defend policies he doesn't like just because "his side" supports them. Similar to my own personal position actually (as I hinted at above, I care more about the outcome than the means for as long as nobody gets hurt). If everybody gets housing and healthcare then I don't care if it happened through government welfare or private charity. Just make it happen. And if you are against one option, you'll better support the other (or you're a terrible person).

It's not straightforward enough already?
Imagine a regular user venturing into Bitcoin. They get an LN wallet because they heard those are the simplest. They want one that can be used with stores they normally buy stuff from.
Every merchant will be connected to a regulated LN server, just like they today use regulated payment processors for credit cards. These will all be required to enforce KYC laws, and thus can't peer with unregulated servers.
So to buy stuff from regular merchants you need a wallet on a regulated LN server that can only send to and receive from other regulated servers (because anybody in this network peering with unregulated servers face fines).
So regular users pick regulated wallets. From their own jurisdiction. Because if they don't, they can't buy stuff from regular stores. These wallets will be fairly few, even if there's still some competition and the same open protocol.
Stuff like operation chokepoint would still work against this network to censor stuff, because most users won't convert out of regulated wallets to unregulated ones. Due to the LN servers being relatively few due to regulation, they will still be able to force pretty nasty terms against merchants much like current credit card issuers. Just slightly less bad. 
Then there's also a need for new policies for how to handle chargebacks / returns with an uncooperative merchant, which is something regulation also likely will require (so you'll probably pay to an arbitrator similar to PayPal instead of paying directly to the merchant).
Yes it definitely improves the security, brings nice new features and makes everything more open and accessible. But no, it doesn't drastically change how commerce works legally. It won't change the legal liability much at all.

The single biggest problem I see with those who oppose immigration because they oppose change is that they *don't understand what makes their countries good*. They speak about the past, but what they describe never existed.
They want new laws, a different culture, changes in language, different freedoms, etc - but none of it resembles the past more than superficially, none of it has anything to do with what made our countries good, they don't want to spend any effort to build and create and cooperate and solve problems unlike the people in the past which they claim inspiration from.
It's nothing more than a cargo cult, copying the appearance in the hopes that it will return what was good. So they destroy future progress because they don't understand that what they remember with nostalgia was the result of past progress.
Because they feel left out, they blame everybody else for stealing what they themselves often made the choice to reject.

Originally Bitcoin wasn't really designed to disrupt (although Satoshi likely understood that possibility), but to provide choice.
You're not forced to use Bitcoin. You chose your own rules (scripts / forks) to follow. You run your node. It's the possibility to escape other's bad decisions in exchange for taking on more responsibility yourself.
It's wasn't meant to destroy or replace anything else, but to complement what already exists. Then you get to chose how much to use each of the available options, if at all.

You can use something that's not really what you want but sufficient, but you wouldn't use something that's *almost* exactly what you want, but which yet can't do exactly the one thing you need it to do. A Bitcoin that can't scale wouldn't be usable for what people would like to use it for.

Your own ability to validate transactions, on behalf of yourself and whoever trust you.

So you don't mind that in an LN dominated scaling system, the majority of users will be on regulated centralized LN servers in their respective jurisdictions, refusing to peer with unregulated servers? That's not a line of centralization you care about, where most people need to wait for their coins to settle to their mainchain wallet to be able to pay you if you don't have a legally approved LN wallet?
That's not a kind of centralization problem you care about? Because most users will just use some LN wallet provided by a local regulated entity.
I don't care about BCH. I was hoping XT would succeed can in the day, but lost hope in the Bitcoin community when the hacks and attacks in it was met with cheering, and the abuse against people advocating it was encouraged, and honest discussions were derailed by people like you.

They mean that by increasing hardware cost, fewer can perform their own chain validation.
But since anybody who wants to mine already must commit to building up so much mining hardware to make it profitable, it's an insignificant additional cost to add a NAS / SAN and to get 1 Gbps internet link. So mining centralization really doesn't matter that much at all in this context. 
(some minor effects does apply for block propagation, but given that they already use methods to only need to push their header + coinbase + transaction selection list instead of the full block, since most miners already know most transactions, this too is fairly insignificant IRL.)
Then there's non-miner nodes. In this context, the only nodes that matter are yours and those you interact with. You do not benefit at all from random strangers running nodes, with exception for blockchain data distribution. You want to know your transactions are valid, and so does the people you transact with. 
Some people wants to cap the hardware requirements so low that everybody may be able to run a full node even on a shitty home internet connection. Even if those people don't make any economically significant transactions over Bitcoin.
Lightning Network is already a second layer without needing a distinct token / coin. But it still requires commitment and settlement transactions, putting a limit to how many people can use it simultaneously. It does help scaling by letting those inside the network to essentially perform an unlimited number of transactions without putting load on Bitcoin itself, but eventually you must go back to the Bitcoin mainchain before jumping back into LN again.

The biggest problem is that even with lightning, you still need commitment and settlement transactions every once in a while to control your money, and that means that there's a limit to how many simultaneous users there can be due to the blocksize limit. It's around a few million active users at once. 
And the transactions you make in Bitcoin definitely have to be worth more to you than the fees to the LN provider AND the Bitcoin transaction fees for the commitments and settlements.

The governance is the chain selection. You can reject blocks applying rules you disagree with.
That's a part of validation. Validating that the rules you agree with are followed.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:52:23
Agreeing with this.
Almost every argument on block size treats it as the core devs and community versus scammers.
Almost nobody takes into consideration that even Lightning Network has a real scaling limit in how many users it can handle. 
It is literally impossible for Bitcoin even with Lightning Network and segwit to handle a full country's worth of users. The commitment transactions just literally doesn't all fit in the blockchain simultaneously.
We can't scale with only tech like Lightning Network. It's great and useful, but it's NOT ENOUGH ALONE! We need that, AND more!
The only potential method to scale without bigger blocks is via Zero-knowledge proofs, but those aren't ready yet for this kind of use.
Another note, LN doesn't necessarily hurt the Bitcoin mainchain or total fees. The mainchain transactions at full capacity will have the same volume, so fees could easily be the same in the long term. Or even higher, because when you only pay occasionally to renew your LN commitment transaction you can pay more.
You run your own node for validation purposes. You're still validating transaction commitments.

Only larger blocks as seen by other segwit nodes. 
The base blocks / stripped blocks are mostly regular blocks containing all the script data and UTXO:s, and this is all that old non-segwit nodes can see, and this data is limited to 1 MB per block.
Everything that exceed 1 MB is nothing but signature data (with today's version of segwit).

Different properties, sure. But for the validation part, all sidechains must be validated by a majority of the miners to remain secure, running full nodes within their respective networks.

Because overhead of the format. You're adding something to your original data, there's the fact that you're now re-encoding it in a different scheme based on a random number. 
It's a fundamental fact of entropy in information theory - you can't compress anything to below its own entropy in size before you lose data, and the fact that you need a descriptive language to explain how to parse the compressed data, you'll end up having a few completely incompressible strings in every set of finite size strings, and they must be accompanied by a descriptor like "this is uncompressed". Otherwise it can't tell apart the uncompressed data from compressed data that needs to be extracted. 
Pigeon hole principle - every piece of compressed data can only decompress to exactly one file. For every short string that decompress to a larger file, there must be some strings becoming smaller after running the decompression algorithm, because otherwise nothing can decompress to *those* strings.

Block size is still a thing, because bits on storage devices and "base block size" (the space for UTXO:s and scripts) is still a thing.

Segwit isn't the only solution, it still caps the UTXO size quite low. An actual block size increase (vs just allowing a greater amount of signature data) would allow more simultaneous users, while segwit + Lightning Network mostly just allows the same users (up to some low million with today's blocks) to transact at much higher rates.
And segwit came very late in the blocksize discussion, it took years to appear and get adopted.
If Bitcoin dies and gets replaced by altcoins simply because the masses decides that it's unusable due to its inability to scale, isn't that a loss? If Bitcoin can't handle the amount of users that want to join but altcoins can, then nobody should have the hubris to say they won't pick something else then Bitcoin.

So how is that not the exact same thing? Despite frequent full blocks they think we don't need to deal with it now. So they clearly think it's for the future, but won't specify when. I've seen no criteria for what would make them actually adopt a tangible plan to implement and deploy it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:47:16
Yeah, that's implicit in the paper and it's pretty much obvious.
For all nodes that follow THE SAME RULES, PoW defines concensus.
If you don't follow the same rules, you're ignored and not part of *that* network's concensus.
I just don't understand what you think my goal here is. I'm saying more node is irrelevant. All that matters is that you know a node *you* can trust for yourself, which is well connected. Why would node count not be irrelevant?
Your node won't jump to another blockchain for having more nodes if it has less PoW. It also won't jump to another blockchain with more PoW and *incompatible rules*.
For every blockchain *compatible with your rules,* most PoW wins.
That's the entire point of the Bitcoin whitepaper.
It says literally this:

Technically that was a rewind rather than downtime. The other valid transactions in that dead fork was pushed to the mempool and accepted again. Downtime would be (IMHO) if everything had to be frozen or everything done was lost and had to be redone.
Like a remote exploit in the Core software forcing the network to halt. Or a serious flaw on the script parsing was made public before fixing.

Why would I be desperate? If your claim was true, then your node ban would be trivial to circumvent anyway. 
They just need to use their own P2P bootstrapping servers and they'll all be connected between themselves, and then add a few normal nodes as proxies between their forked nodes and the original network. Most them wouldn't notice the difference.
The only difference is that the labels wouldn't be visible in the logs of regular node users. And again, who cares about node count?

The entire UTXO set must be in the 1 MB capped base blocks / stripped blocks. Everything exceeding that is currently nothing but signature data. (future softforks may add functionality, but old nodes will be unable to verify it)

There's no license violations involved here, so the comparison doesn't make sense
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:42:46
Old non-segwit full nodes still know the state of the UTXO set. That's the most important thing you need to interact with Bitcoin. 
They just don't understand all the new additional validity / concensus rules, so what they see as valid *could* be invalid due to conditions they don't know about. So they either have to upgrade for full security post-segwit activation, or trust miner majority (SPV mode security), so yes they are technically reduced from full nodes to not quite full nodes. But they still validate all non-segwit transactions just fine. They don't become passive.

What are you even trying to say here? Sure it was assumed most CPU:s would be roughly equal.

In Bitcoin, the only node that matters is your own. So why is node count so important?
The only people hurt by it is whoever that *needs* that level of security if their own but can't afford it / don't have the bandwidth. A random user running a node without relying on it doesn't help the Bitcoin network with anything other than helping data distribution (forwarding blockchain data).

Mining power isn't directly linked to confirmation time over long time periods, given that the difficulty adjustment aims to keep the block creation at 1 block per 10 minutes on average. Fluctuations in mining power only temporarily affects confirmation time.

That person has literally said it's wrong to try to create a direct competitor to Bitcoin using Bitcoin's original resources, to try to convince its users to switch over directly.
I mean exactly 100% literally, he thinks it shouldn't be allowed at all for an outside group to hardfork Bitcoin. Not simply discouraged, but literally forbidden. He's said as much. His claim that the original "Bitcoin project" would "own" the blockchain means that it wouldn't be allowed to use the existing blockchain together with any other code than what the Bitcoin Core developers have permitted. Which makes absolutely no sense given that the development process itself is supposed to be decentralized. 
So that's pretty closely equivalent to how the only change in LibreOffice vs OpenOffice was part of the name and the leadership, wherein the community took the project in a different direction because they disagreed with the previous leadership (Oracle). A few developers stayed behind, many switched over.

That's only a problem if you intend spend coins AND keep your (remaining) coins on both forks.

Yes, kind of, but they're (specially formatted) anyone-can-spend transactions, which means that they still appear valid to old nodes that can't see the signatures in the stripped 1 MB max blocks. Only full segwit nodes see and parse the segwit signatures.
Segwit transactions can be understood in full without the signature data, they just can't be validated in full without it. Old nodes trust the miner majority on correctness of the transactions. Like with all other softforks the old nodes do not support.

Your obsession with getting a direct quote only appears to be a tactic to avoid admitting defeat, since literally all other evidence you may need is there. One of the guys saying it is Ray Dillinger who talked to Satoshi on Metzdowd in the first weeks in 2008 after the paper was posted. 
Everything he has written directly states he intended Bitcoin to scale up as soon as it was prepared to handle it. Every limit he made or suggested was only for the sake of bootstrapping the network, such as when he requested a delay of GPU mining.

My naive solution that I was thinking of was hash(seed, block number) &lt; percentage target (encoded in binary, of course), which you'd compute for all blocks. Presumably O(N), too slow IMHO for phones and embedded devices which are active in the network. Your computer sciencey terminology is slightly above my head so far. I really need to study this stuff more...

You're missing my argument.

If there's no strong proof of origin, both sides can claim they're telling the truth and *you can't know* who if any are lying. What if there was a MITM? You have no idea. You need something completely different to prove any crime. There's no advantage in handing in a photo of something if it is easy to fake.

Given the current hostile situation, what makes you believe that anybody will trust any promise of block size increases when they come?
Why do you think nothing can replace Bitcoin? That's hubris, average Joe doesn't honestly care that much about age. They care about shiny and simple. You're talking like Nokia just before the iPhone. You've got to be active to keep your lead. They can start off targeting a completely different market than you and blindside you, to then steal your own users too (like Blackberry who also thought iPhone couldn't compete). 
MAST only helps making large complex transactions smaller. It doesn't let you fit more UTXO:s in. Same with Schnorr, it just decreases signature size. No help with UTXO count.
The only thing that can increase UTXO count is larger blocks or extension blocks. The former is fairly simple and just need concensus, the latter requires far more engineering than even Lightning Network segwit together.

It's open source, you can review it.
They can't lock it up permanently - it uses multisignature transactions with a timelock, after timelock expiration you can withdraw the funds yourself again even if the LN server disappears.
Can't withdraw double. It's still built around multisignature transactions that need your approval, built on Bitcoin.
Enter and exit LN is on the blockchain. But the coordination of transfers inside LN is still done using a "tab" which itself is actually a "template transaction", you're continously updating an actual Bitcoin transaction signed by you and the LN server, and the settlement consists of publishing a variant of this transaction signed by you and the LN server.

So why has no such plan ever come closer to anything other than "we'll consider it for the future" despite that blocks so frequently has been near 1 MB for so long with frequent hours long backlogs?

You think fidget spinners will become worthless in a week, so you borrow a bunch of them and sell them on while the price is still high, getting you a bunch of money. 
Now you hope that they'll go down in price by the weekend, because otherwise the guys you borrowed fidget spinners from will beat you up if you can't pay back what it would cost to replace them. They loan you X fidget spinners and want at least that many back when a week has passed. 
But the price didn't fall. 
So now you have to go around to people with fidget spinners for sale and offer them increasingly larger amounts of money (because the guy with the lowest sale price don't have enough fidget spinners to cover your ass, so you need to go to more sellers), until you have as many fidget spinners as you borrowed, so that you can give back fidget spinners to the people you borrowed from. Because if you can't give back as much as you borrowed, you get beaten up.
If you had been right about fidget spinners losing value, it would be really cheap to buy back new ones to replace what you borrowed, and you'd be swimming in cash.

If it is anything like the idea I had and have written about a few times here, you essentially use the main blockchain to checkpoint any number of secondary blockchains, where each new block carries a Zero-knowledge proof of conforming to the rules defined when that blockchain was registered. Like sidechains but integrated in the same main chain.
Secondary chains can apply arbitary logic, they can be used for DNS and other registries (Namecoin) or timestamping (Factom) or anything else you like. And indexes / summaries of all changes to the blockchain state is created with Zero-knowledge proofs of correctness. 
The users only need to store the headers, Zero-knowledge proofs and the transactions relevant to them, similar to SPV mode today but MORE secure thanks to Zero-knowledge proofs.

Internal incentives are typically stronger than external ones. Money isn't a very strong motivator measured in how it affects your performance. Personal goals has a greater effect on performance. (The effect on effort also isn't entirely intuitive.) Social acceptance is another motivation, and group pressure is effective simply because people want to be part of a group. Money is an effective way to compare yourself with others, which as a social tool is a greater incentive for acquiring it than the potential benefit of hoarding it for most people. 
And for some people, drama is an incentive (hence drama queens). And back to my quote above, some people just want to watch the world burn. They don't care much about their own lives, it is simply entertaining to destroy.

I'm aware that Zero-knowledge proofs aren't there yet. Hopefully they'll get there one day. This system would use PoW the same way as Bitcoin. It just wouldn't have any preconceptions on what you use it for. 
IMHO it would be best if "namespaces" would have the hash of transactions (including the declaration of the rules) that registered it + the hash of the block it got registered in as the main unique identifier. They could also claim human readable names (first-come first-serve, like Namecoin), which you would wait a few days before using in transactions to reference the namespace. Script verification is replaced by Zero-knowledge proof verification. 
Zero-knowledge proofs would be used in both transactions to prove the validity of hash commitments of the actions taken to modify the state, and they would be used to create an index that "summarizes" the current state as a result of all previous transactions, used for checkpointing.

Per-connection it behaves the same. But I2P uses many parallel ones, not just a single one for everything. In I2P it doesn't just add load, but it adds cover traffic to make all traffic harder to analyze as the torrent data goes over many many parallel paths instead of putting a high load on exit nodes and the few nodes in their tunnels. Also, all nodes in I2P route by default. Unless you torrent at full capacity 24/7, you're not all that bad for the network.

Trezor, Ledger, Yubikey type devices, etc, is the best choice.
Also, a PIN or password of below 80 bits in entropy is insufficient when there's no hardware that can enforce rate limiting. With rate limiting enforced by secure hardware, a short PIN can work.

It would potentially increase value, IF it were to practically speaking enable increased adoption beyond what Bitcoin 1 MB supports (if the userbase grows beyond what the current Bitcoin can handle).
Personally I believe we need larger blocks soon, because with the current existing tech (lightning included) Bitcoin is still limited to a very small number of simultaneous users (relative to stuff like PayPal), but I have no idea which particular solution would be best so I do not have any specific opinion on SW2X itself.
Bitcoin blocks have been nearly full with long wait time for quite a while. Lightning network only makes *repeat* payments more efficient, it doesn't help for people who only rarely makes payments. So it will likely take long before we see any notable benefit from lightning network.

You can't put more load on the network than you have in bandwidth. If you share 1/3 of your bandwidth for routing and use 2/3 for connections (IIRC that's close to the standard configuration, for when you're maxing your bandwidth) to download and upload for your own usage, then you're not draining more than tunnel length * your bandwidth * 2/3. With torrenting you can them also divide that by two as each upload represents one download for another node when measuring the full load on the network of all the nodes. So lets say on average 4 * 10 Mbps * 2/3 / 2, or 16.67 Mbps load distributed across the routing nodes, while adding 3.33 Mbps. So in total 13.33 net load. 
And how many will ONLY torrent full time during the uptime of their nodes? 1-10/(10+13.33) = the fraction of the node uptime to not run torrenting if you want to contribute. Or you can count torrenting time / (10/23.33) to get that number. In short, for 3h torrenting keep the node running 10h (7h for routing the traffic of others). 
With Tor, it is a drain only.

By the way it feels like it should be easier to make a practical algorithm if you took took the size argument and converted it to a percentage / probability for the given block height, to then use that value in the block selection. So the size would remain approximately constant while the percentage falls as the block height grows. I think trying to define and use size inside the algorithm would be more complex than necessary, unless my intuition is off.

Properly implemented, there's no problem at all with auditing supply. Just run an algorithm that counts the available coins in the full blockchain in the ZKP generation runtime, and the resulting proof is sufficient even for SPV mode users to know its not inflated.
Not every ZKP method needs anything like master keys. Those versions of ZKP are just currently more efficient than the ones that lack a master key.
Schnorr signatures do not compress the UTXO set. That itself limits scalability massively.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:19:55
Define "state of the network", and "understanding". The UTXO set is the main "state of the network" in terms of coin ownership, and it doesn't itself include signatures or other validation data. You can strip away pretty much all other blockchain data once you have your UTXO set, and will still be able to do almost anything that a normal full node can. 
The concensus rules defines how the UTXO set may be modified, and THIS depends on parsing data like signatures, but those aren't really "state" (descriptors) in computing terms, they're rather just data used to determine the state. It's intermediate data. Segwit transactions and normal transactions both modify the UTXO set in equivalent ways.
What you seem to call "state" and "understanding" would be more accurately be called "ability to validate the current state". Because both post and pre segwit nodes will parse segwit blocks with the exact same outcome, with the exception for when the blocks are segwit-invalid but pre-segwit valid.
The state of a thing in computing is the specific set of collection data (and logic) that determines its behavior or properties. In Bitcoin that's the UTXO set. The data processed isn't final state, it's at most part of the intermediate state (the state in between starting and finalizing processing). Anything that can be discarded post processing and replaced with a cached value (like with yes/no) isn't itself state, its processing outcome is the state. This applies to signatures.

Yes, that's exactly it. Clients don't follow blockchains with INVALID rules by their own programming.
Have I ever said ANYTHING that contradicts that!? Why are you saying I've contradicted that? Are you even reading my comments in full? 
Proof of work in chains you consider invalid is ignored.
But when the chain is considered valid, proof of work wins.
Miners mine where it's profitable = on the chain that the most users consider valid. Same as above, these users will ONCE AGAIN ignore node counts, they do not care how many miners there are or how many nodes there are on *any* chain *anywhere*.
Most proof of work on a valid chain wins. Node count is ignored.
Please do note - node count ALSO DO NOT correspond to number of users. There can be a million users with a hundred nodes, or a thousand users with a thousand nodes. The million will represent more value for miners.

Bitcoin Core expects to be able to safely save files before closing. If you make large transactions and create many new keys without having backups, you can end up with incomplete backups. 
Try Electrum, it uses deterministic wallets based on a single seed that you can back up safely. All addresses is generated from that one seed. That's all you need to recover your coins if the wallet software somehow fails.

You can prove that a certain output, for example a compressed index, is derived from a certain input. Any algorithmic statement can be proven. So for example you can prove your index accurately represents the current state of the blockchain by referencing the latest block header with the index, using the Zero-knowledge proof.

The total maximum needed space depends on the size of the "least prunable" point in the blockchain history and the most recent blocks you're currently working with (which you keep in memory), in other words the point in time with the largest UTXO set, i.e. you could have a point with tons of unspent transactions, which then afterwards all get spent in a short period of time. So at one point the UTXO set might have been significantly larger than it is currently. Then the current space requirements isn't representative of the space requirements to sync from scratch.
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:05:05
You basically described a basic Lightning Network. The problem is that there needs to be at least one UTXO per unique user every few weeks, and that caps the amount of people that can use Bitcoin at once.

I don't support any one particular current proposal. I used to support XT (which originated from a few core developers disagreeing with the rest on policy, because they didn't want to wait anymore), but then the community started fracturing and that proposal died, and nothing after it has been anywhere near good enough. And after that, every single big block proposal has been instantly shot down with both censorship and all kinds of accusations of malice. 
Currently I'm rather the guy who wants to see fancy math like Zero-knowledge proofs implemented to allow full security in SPV mode. 
The guy who wants to extend a system similar to Lightning Network into a full scale programmable platform (similar to ethereum) with user definable programs *accessible on the blockchain* with custom interfaces, barely needing to touch the actual blockchain except for checkpointing the system state. Block creation wouldn't really be done by the miners, they would rather pick blocks assembled by "aggregators" that collect "state updates" for the blockchain and that condense them into small checkpoints, along with Zero-knowledge proofs of everything being correct.
But that's decades away, and if Bitcoin can't scale before that then it might end up earning a reputation as unusable and becoming forgotten, replaced by altcoins willing to scale by other means. 
Because even with Lightning Network and segwit, Bitcoin can't handle even a few million simultaneous users simply because it can't handle all the channel commitment transactions at once.

Because the fiat transfers in between banks rely on trust that takes tons of manual labor to audit and uphold. That's why it is often so expensive to move money across banks and internationally.
It is worse when the sender's bank and receiver's bank don't directly trust each other, because then they need to find a trusted path across a network of other banks to route the money through (think of it as a financial network among the banks, each link is between two banks who trust each other).

1: What you're doing today might not benefit all that much, but one day you might want to try something new where Bitcoin is the best option by a great margin, like international trade. 
2: With Bitcoin, the model has moved from trusted third parties and insurance to client side cryptographic security with (but default) no trusted third parties. This means securing it is your job, but if you know how to secure it properly them it is more secure than fiat because you can not lose money as a result of *somebody else* getting fooled. 
3: Network effects! Bitcoin will grow relatively slowly by spreading among people who consider it better for their use cases. And as time goes, new services and products and clients will be created and Bitcoin's usability will improve, making it worth using for even more people. And eventually it will be used by so many that the masses will flood in because they'll see the benefit for them too, and all the cool new things it can do, and the downsides there are now from their point of view will be solved.

Yeah, on a second thought it does indeed make more sense with a seed to share. Somebody else can figure out the most efficient way to pick blocks to store from a seed and percentage / size limit, such that you quickly can enumerate the numbers for the blocks one holds.
Shouldn't the size limit also play into which blocks are selected so you don't just hold the first X blocks the seed points to, and nothing at all after it? Simple size limit plus blockchain length changes, so that's also a bad idea. I'm thinking seed + percentage value is the best choice, as you can adjust the percentage to go lower if it starts using too much space. And you'd always be storing the same set of blocks until you change the seed or percentage.
Also, maybe if you pick a longer list of blocks than the percentage represents and sorts it, you've got deterministic block selection even when you change the percentage.
Edit: hmmm... That too seems impractical to make efficient as I don't know of a better way to generate that list of numbers than by enumeration + filtering the number list using the seed + percentage, or to sort the list and pick the top of the list using the percentage. There ought to be a better way to deterministically select the same set of blocks every time efficiently, with the selection distribution remaining random across the full blockchain even when the blockchain grows...
Edit 2: the chance of a given block being selected needs to be independent for every block. The selection method should probably produce the numbers starting from 1 and up to not become unwieldy and to remain deterministic as the block count changes without becoming too complex. And like I said before, changing the percentage shouldn't cause the block selection to be completely swapped out, it would be annoying to manage otherwise.
Right now the only algorithm I can think of that would behave as I want it to would be to let the seed + block number produce a threshold value, and if it is below your percentage value then you store that block. Then you also track which blocks are close above the threshold to make it easy to quickly adjust upwards. Adjusting down is trivial. But this would be somewhat inefficient...

Are you feeding both TRNG outputs into a strong CSPRNG like fortuna? You should use that, AND merge with deterministic seeds when applicable.

One person, whoever feels like it (but probably miners) creates a statement using software running in a Zero-knowledge proof generator. Anybody can verify that the statement is correct because the Zero-knowledge proof verifies correctly. 
Digital signatures is one limited version of Zero-knowledge proofs - you prove that you hold the private component to a public value (the public key) without revealing what it is, while showing that you approve of a certain digitally encoded message.

An entirely generic blockchain that checkpoints the state of and interactions with arbitary registered algorithms with accompanying data sets (kind of like a Turing complete extension of Namecoin), using Zero-knowledge proofs for both compression and validation, you could implement just about anything on top. Make the root blockchain scale well and perform well and you won't need to touch that code ever again. All other new features would be added on top, in "namespaces" under different policies for governance, in data sets under those namespaces following predefined rules, allowing you to choose which data sets to work with.

Bitcoin defines the largest majority of cooperating miners as the authority and assumes it can be trusted as a result of the assumption that there's no one entity dominating and that honest cooperation is more profitable. 
Direct attacks would likely face resistance from other forces responding with adding more of their own hashing power as well as directly attacking the malicious miners. 
Bitcoin is about (reasonably stable) global concensus, and allowing the community to chose to follow a *group* of entities they trust (not simply *one* trusted authority with unbounded power) isn't a problem. 
Decentralized verification isn't decentralized concensus. Everybody would need to have identical priorities and goals and skills to achieve concensus from a large set of random repositories with unknown sources.

Bitcoin today could already outgrow the capacity of the poorest node owner, simply in the form of block storage space or initial sync bandwidth (since total size isn't limited).

I don't really care about any one current proposal. 
I used to support XT, but then the active censorship of all discussions of everything related to discussions about larger blocks drew out and encouraged the growth of toxic crowds that the mods refused to do anything about, and this community was pretty much ruined as those people openly cheered over DDoS attacks against XT nodes while anybody trying to talk about that Bitcoin might need larger blocks one day was immediately silenced.
Tech like Zero-knowledge proofs would immediately destroy any further arguments that those hostile people ever could possibly have by enabling full security even with header only sync, even for ancient hardware. Talk about stuff like "my ancient computer must be able to validate every single transaction" and "my smartphone must fit the entire blockchain" would just sound ridiculous, and would no longer be a bottleneck. The raw underlying data could be terabytes per block and nobody would care, because nobody would be hurt by it.

I haven't written it out yet (still) or done a more detailed blueprint-ish description, but what I imagine is something like multi-layer ZKP based version of Lightning, including something like live updated Merkle Tree Hashes of every spent and created input.
Every organization in the "web" (such as chain store regional HQ's and payment processors) collects pending payments and bundles them up into a smaller compressed single transaction with a ZKP, and then international organizations use the Merkle tree hashes or similar to run **efficient** ***conflict detection*** **(no two bundles should ever contain the same UTXO's!)**, with the ability to request exclusion of transactions from a bundle by the organisations supplying the bundles with conflicting payments. Non-conflicting bundles are then merged and gets another ZKP. Miners then pick among the available bundles supplied by these organisations, and include their headers and ZKP:s in the blocks.
Everything will then chain down to a set of valid non-conflicting transactions, and these organisations handle the storage of these separately (the data in them will be needed to actually use an output of yours in these bundles so you can prove your transaction is valid), but should be stored redundantly and SPV clients should be able to easily request all of them.
By having separate (deterministic) Merkle tree hashes (felicia trees is also an option) of all spent and non-spent inputs and all addresses you can essentially prove if something is missing or not, to detect censorship. If something is lacking, trying to replicate it won't match exactly.

It is more expensive to compete with the current miners (create a chain with more PoW behind it than any other chain) than it is to compete with the current minters in PoS if you have keys linked to old stake. 
You can't just fork an old PoW block and run from there with a slow miner. You'll never accumulate more PoW than anyone else.
With pure PoS, having keys from old stake allows you to build a chain of arbitary length minting with that stake. The difficulty in PoS will at most force you to have stake distributed over several addresses and to create many alternate chains to successfully create a long enough chain. Which is what poor man's scrypt means. 
Old miners lose value over time. Old PoS stake *don't* unless you checkpoint and thus centralize OR expose yourself to network splitting risk. Without checkpointing, all you got is difficulty = scrypt copy. 
Seeing a longer chain from less stake don't tell you if you were isolated with an attacker spending a lot on acquiring stake and that the rest of the network has been running as usual, or if an attacker just created a longer chain. 
You can't just apply automatic software based heuristics to detect attacks, because an attacker could attempt to game that to get the real chain declared as the attacking chain by enough users (thus forking the network).

UTXO conflict detection is easy even in large sets and is parallellizable. A large part of transaction validation don't require knowing the previous state at that time - you can chose to note the assumptions it makes (what UTXO's does it reference?) and look those up later, a typical out of order computation optimization. 
The only parts that needs to be single threaded somewhere is the selection of those transactions and final state calculation (but at that point you can already have trivially applicable state diffs ready that makes this fast too).

It still leaves the space for UTXO:s and script data extremely limited. Also, since segwit merely splits out signatures in a new extension datastructure, old nodes still only see 1 MB blocks.

False false false false false, if the blocks would appear to occupy more space than 1 MB to old non-segwit nodes THEY WOULD BE REJECTED AND CONSIDERED A HARDFORK
What it does is literally just to add a new datastructure that signatures are moved into. This is mandatory for segwit full nodes to access to validate the blocks, but is NOT necessary for old nodes in order to parse the blocks. 
So while full validation requires a larger "combined" block we still have the old 1 MB base blocks + a separate signature data structure accompanying it (combined size to to 4 MB MAXIMUM).

The entire point of fees is that the users collectively determine what they're willing to pay in fees, and the miners include that such has sufficient fees by their judgment. Long before blocks were consistently full there was already fee policies that meant high fees confirmed faster.

Even with segwit + LN there's a very low limit to the onboarding capacity into the Bitcoin network for new users. Every new user must buy bitcoins and make an initial LN commitment transaction. They also have to settle and re-commit periodically. 
All that for all potentially millions of users competes for just 1 MB every 10 minutes.
Only extension blocks could circumvent this without a hardfork. This would essentially make the standard block space a "legacy block".
Edit: thanks for the unmotivated downvotes. Segwit isn't a silver bullet, we need more.

Keep backups of the seed in several places. Treat it like cash, because it can be stolen equally easy when written on paper. One method to increase safety in case of theft is to use Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme to require multiple copies to recover the seed, see Passguardian.

The computational requirements on hashing would likely make sure it will take looong before quantum computers can do it. First of all, they must be able to be reprogrammed with the latest block hash every 10 minutes. Then they must run multiple rounds including computing a Merkle tree hash of all randomly sorted transactions (for increased entropy), followed by 2xSHA256. Then the quantum error correction must be applied, then it has to test the output with classic circuits. It must do this at a rate close to the square root of the frequency ASIC miners operate at (up to a few GHz) with not much more power per cycle than a regular ASIC to even have a chance to be competitive.
Now that's assuming the quadratic speedup is preserved and that the errors are few enough with so many qubits and such a complex setup.

The 51% link doesn't consider what happens if much of the network is offline (few miners to compete with). So a DDoS against miners with higher stake is a risk. 
The link on nothing-at-stake do not consider network level attackers, and would punish legitimate users who thought their previous stake was ignored or lost when mining (orphaned stake is burnt). No consideration for sybil attacks. Bitcoin works because honesty is the most profitable choice - for PoS, dishonesty is more profitable. If you believe selfish mining is a problem for PoW that could halt the Bitcoin blockchain, then this problem is equivalent - the short term profit is the goal. The individual miner isn't harmed directly but his own actions, it is first even everybody does it that it is a problem. And when everybody does it, nobody want to be the only honest miner. Locked coins would also not be a problem if you can generate an excessive amount of blocks. 
Grinding - centralized checkpoints is the first answer? There's no real meaningful answer to why it wouldn't work. Anything other than pure stake based chain selection means you can increase your probability of getting your chain selected by testing a large number of generated chains against the chain selection code. 
History revision - centralized checkpointing (Bitcoin had it as a DOS prevention, with headers first it is now deprecated). And the recent history is not effectively protected. And it opens up for hard failure if large parts of the network go down. 
And still nothing that addresses bootstrap network attacks.

ZKPs is generated by what I'd call a custom runtime, compare to Java. You give it your program and input data. It processes it and spits out your results and a ZKP.
The input data could be the data for a simulation, the output could be the solution encrypted to a public key derived from the key of the recipient Stealth address style, a hash of the nonce that will let him derive the private key, and a ZKP that proves that the encrypted output was generated from the simulation and is a valid proof, and that the nonce will let him decrypt it. 
Then he can get the nonce in return for paying for the work.

How do you expect to make the anyone-can-spend format segwit transactions replay protected and still simultaneously be a softfork that old Bitcoin nodes understand? 
Non-segwit majority miners can sell to non-segwit exchanges even if forked. 
Non-segwit miners can ALWAYS sell to all exchanges if there's no fork and if they produce standard blocks, because segwit nodes and miners accepts standard blocks. 
You can't be certain everybody wants the segwit fork. In fact the social impact of the fork could force a delay in segwit activation if too few activated segwit, because the other chain is more useful / more broadly accepted. This is the major part that you missed! One fork or the other must be reversed, and one will be more valuable.

So you absolutely NEED trusted sources and not just ANY peer like with PoW? If you have genuinely trusted sources interconnected with all the important parts of the network, why again is PoS necessary? Why not do a Ripple? 
Faking using a PoW blockchain and not having it appear differs drastically from making everything look perfectly normal.
That strategy of yours, of perpetual manual involvement, will both wear people out and piss them of as well as fork the network. Giving people 29 day and 23h forks and DDoSing everybody for 2h will make everybody checkpoint different forks.
If everybody sees different forks, you can not guarantee all users will select the same one to use.
You need no manual review at all with PoW. Any algorithm that do need it will fail.

I assume they peg the market value to some extent as they do hold a full reserve of corresponding Bitcoins according to themselves. They could arbitrage themselves to increase the price if their shares dropped a lot below Bitcoin. Buy shares and sell the corresponding Bitcoin and destroy the shares (assuming that's allowed) and you increase demand and reduce supply of the shares while making a profit. If share prices go up they could also buy more Bitcoins and add new shares at a profit.

History rewinding, nothing at stake (massive forking to hope one of your chains wins) and network level attacks can do it. 
If your choices are between accepting less stake in mining or a collapse of the altcoin, then you accept less stake. Which means network level isolation attacks easily can fool you that you're on the real chain.
In Bitcoin, the individual scarce resources (miners with their power supply) can be replaced if lost. No such thing in PoS.

You can throw those strawmen in the trash where they belong. 
I have no desire to abolish any development models. My main problem with the current process is that it is far too hard to get your ideas heard, and that too many people think it is perfectly fine to maliciously suppress unwanted ideas.
Multiple development groups is OTOH inevitable. A blockchain to be used by the entire planet will require more work than any one team can handle alone. 
No desire whatsoever to make the blocksize unlimited. It just needs to not be too small. 
My ideal solution is using Zero-knowledge proofs to enable secure compact UTXO commitment checkpoints, which would enable a far more efficient method of both SPV mode and pruning by not requiring you to download anything but the last checkpoint and the blocks following it to do full verification. This would be far more compact and efficient than anything else. 
Satoshi himself even talked about that Bitcoin likely would be running its nodes in server halls. So then what is Bitcoin if his vision doesn't count? 


Literally the opposite of what I said. I don't want one person in control. I want the community as a whole to cooperate. You OTOH is defending the status quo with a few dozen developers who singlehandedly can determine what's in the next Bitcoin release as "decentralized". 
You didn't explain how agreeing to change the rules is an attack. 


There's literally no loss in performance from a node unrelated to you disappearing from your chain and stopping to validate transactions according to the rules you use. Every node validates transactions independently. It doesn't matter if that node moved to another chain or not. 


Only if there's widespread disagreement. And even then, if any part of the group could block another from choosing to use another client and fork away, that would make Bitcoin centralized instead of decentralized. It would mean Bitcoin have gatekeepers that decide its future. 


It is actually still in beta. The discussion is not over, that's not how it works. If you can't prove it bad or wrong, you can't stop people from still wanting to make the change. Otherwise you're making yourself the centralized gatekeeper.
I can't understand why you believe there's anything decentralized about you being able to censor discussions based on that you FEEL they're done. I can't believe you think a discussion should be ended without having reached any provable conclusions.

What I like to see, which might overlap with what he is asking for, is UTXO set index checkpoints with Zero-knowledge proofs of validity.

Oh look, another strawman fan who lies about me being an shill without bothering to check if I've ever even been active there. 
You're just looking for conflict. And you're failing pretty bad with your arguments. 
Full nodes validate everything. Lightweight nodes only verify headers and transactions related to them. 
Segwit extends the meaning of the block data, so an old-format full node is reduced to a lightweight node due to now trusting the miners. A segwit validating full node is the new standard for full validation.
Every non-segwit node will no longer be able to validate if a block or transaction is truly 100% legit, and can therefore be fooled. This can only be made impractical by ensuring segwit enforcing mining majority. It would do that simply through ensuring the hashrate of segwit enforcing miners is too high to feasibly create a segwit-invalid block that could fool non-segwit nodes. 
Your percentages of nodes flagging for different things means nothing because ANYBODY can inflate the numbers by starting new node instances with whatever flag they like.
Miners ARE nodes. They just do one more additional task of creating blocks. Miners chose what (Bitcoin compatible) rules to enforce within their blocks, and only miners running segwit compatible nodes can form valid segwit blocks. Miners can also chose to not create segwit blocks. 
In fact miners can blacklist anything they want, and that's literally how segwit is implemented - segwit format anyone-can-spend transactions are only allowed if they have valid segwit witnesses, and are otherwise banned. 
A node-less miner would be unable to receive or process transactions or broadcast blocks. 
You need to stop strawmanning, stop pretending you know more than you do, stop ascribing motives to others that you have no evidence for, and stop posting before you confirmed your assumptions.
It's time for you to do some real research into how the protocol works. 
And in fact I'm pro segwit, I just stated I'm against UASF. Because those node counts can be falsified. You would have known that if you tried using your brain...

And it doesn't matter how large the group is if they're capable of telling others what to do and if the group themselves decide who belongs in it. You can't just decide that you're one of them, they do. 
I have already read the whitepaper. The only thing it covers is how to agree on which blocks belongs to one particular blockchain or not, following which rules. 
It does not anywhere talk about how to agree on the rules. It assumes the users already have agreed on that by another means.

You need to explain how. Degrades in what way? Nodes running incompatible code *is not part of that same system*. A hardfork is a separate blockchain with only a *shared past*. 


The concensus can change. 


False. Bitcoin is meant to assist mutually untrusting users to agree on a shared history of blocks using mutually agreed upon rules. There's absolutely nothing stopping you from coming to an agreement to use different rules. Who's attacked when nobody's hurt?

Technically you can call every type of cryptography with secret inputs and some provable property of the output a special case of ZKP, with generic ZKP like SNARKs being the universal variant.
Signatures prove possession of a private key related to a public key, and that you "approve" of a given message. ZKP + hashes can recreate that; $secret is the secret key, $public = hash($secret), then you get signature = hash(hash($message), secret) + hash($message) + $public + Zero-knowledge proof of that signature was generated with hash($message) &amp; the input to $public. 
You can also use plain ZKP as a hash (just let the code in the ZKP runtime echo the input, no fancy computations needed).

Dude, read the spec. 
Non-segwit nodes will happily accept segwit invalid blocks even after activated UASF. Old nodes relies entirely on segwit miners having hashrate majority to not be forked off from segwit enforcing nodes.
Segwit miners will only mine on blocks from non-segwit miners if they are segwit-valid (no segwit transactions, as they can't form segwit blocks). Old miners will mine on anything. Old nodes will accept anything.
Non-segwit hashrate majority + segwit invalid block + lots of non-segwit nodes = forked network.

People don't pay high fees unless the alternatives are worse. That could mean time penalties, needing to cash out, or that it is still cheaper than the alternative (such as for large transfers). 
High fees is not a signal of things working well. It's a sign of things not currently being catastrophic.
Discussions about larger blocks was indeed censored, and we still do need scaling mechanisms that allows more transactions on the blockchain. It should be in place BEFORE things move from not-ideal to catastrophic. Too high fees will price out the majority of regular users. An overloaded Bitcoin will suffocate itself.
The only not disastrous non-hardfork compromise would be softforking in extension blocks using some new more efficient datastructure, and slowly shifting over the entire community into exclusively using that. Ideally implementing checkpoints with Zero-knowledge proofs guaranteeing their security, for maximal compressibility with maintained security. 
UASF is too risky, it's a classic chicken race problem. You don't ever really know if you should retreat or keep going, and failure is extremely harmful (forking out a significant part of the community into a minority chain). (Note that also Greg Maxwell have expressed that UASF isn't ideal, on the Bitcoin dev mailing list.)

The fee market is one of the most inconsequential things here, and yet I've seen it be used as a hammer to kill discussions about blocksize for years. Do you really think it would be so hard to set a reasonable fee policy later? 
It isn't exactly hard: anticipated necessary miner reward per block / average number of transactions per block = average transaction fee. 
If the miners stick to that, the network will adjust naturally if the users thinks the fee is reasonable. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 12:20:38

It doesn't need to be deployed today. We just need to know it is working and ready to be deployed once we do need it. That's still years away. There's also good reasons for working hard on formalizing the protocol and taking out ambiguity, such as with encodings.

If a non-segwit mining majority pushes a segwit-incompatible transaction to the network then that would not only fork the chains into segwit and non-segwit, but the non-segwit chain would allow you to steal all the segwit UTXO:s not coming from the segwit coinbase (meaning that if you spend on the segwit fork with the segwit format, you'll lose those same coins instantly on the non-segwit fork).
As soon as segwit is active we NEED certainty that nobody important will run non-segwit nodes, otherwise it allows trivial fraud against every node that doesn't fully validate segwit.
Only if segwit has mining majority AND all major nodes and clients are segwit aware then we're really safe.
A segwit incompatible transaction in the Bitcoin chain would cause a clean hardfork where all old nodes stay and notice nothing, and only segwit nodes forks off to a new chain.
Edit: thanks for downvoting the facts. I'm not even against segwit, just against UASF. If you don't want to understand the risks then you only have yourself to blame.

The idea is that the issuer verify your identity and issues credentials to you, essentially by defining various properties about you.
You can then prove statements about any arbitary subset of those properties to be true in response to a challenge, with somebody asking something like "prove you're a citizen in one of the countries XYZ and above the age of 18". But proving this to many verifiers do NOT reveal you're the same person, there's no personally identifying information there. They COULD ask you to prove your name and SSN, if they need to identify you individually, but you can chose what to reveal.
Your gym could even issue credentials proving you're a member, and your grocery store could offer coupons on fruits for showing you have a gym membership. And you don't reveal who you are.

Being distributed together by default for witnesses nodes doesn't mean they can't be split up. Despite your need to find one, there simply is no contradiction here. And they need to be able to split out the witness data, it's the only way it can be softforked. The spec literally calls it a separate new datastructure that can be deleted WITHOUT making the block invalid by the pre-segwit spec.

I don't see how you could make any sensible ranking between the contribution from PoW and PoS that doesn't make one of them worthless in the long term relative to the other.

I don't think you really understood what I'm talking about. 
Code is code. Specifications is specifications. Could they try to hide malicious behavior? Possibly, but nobody would accept their solutions unmodified anyway. Chances that their code would be implemented as-is are zero. Not because they're assumed malicious, but because they're assumed to be not omnipotent and not omniscient. 
The concepts they introduce will be studied and modified over and over until there's no place left for any serious flaws to hide. 
Detecting covert asicboost was done by looking at the output of code OTHERS ran. Blackbox reverse engineering, essentially. They looked at the unusual behavior of some miners and looked at what properties of the mining system it might be relying on. And found it. 
The reason it wasn't found earlier because there was no reason to suspect it. Because it wasn't code running on the hardware of the developers themselves. It ran elsewhere.

The attackers must always at any given point in time have enough resources to match all existing miners to get 51% hashing power. If this gets cheaper, it is really mainly because the total reward is lower. Resources spent on mining will always tend to follow the reward, as any large difference will motivate miners to acquire more hashing power for increased profit. 
If the total mining power goes too low, users can motivate miners by increasing the fees they pay.

Fitting more transactions don't make the segwit base block = old format regular block exceed 1 MB, not ever. You'd get a hardfork if you tried. 
Old nodes WILL NEVER see the that segwit signature data structure which exceeds the 1 MB base block.

False. They do see more transactions due to segwit using anyone-can-spend transactions with smaller in-block data, but do not see the corresponding signatures and thus can't validate them. They still only see 1 MB blocks as before. To old nodes, blocks just are not larger.

You need to cover the capital investments of the miners too, in case the value of Bitcoin falls (they'll lose money from their hardware otherwise). You have to persuade them that a live 51% attack won't be damaging to them. You have to make sure the payout from the attack exceeds the mining reward and what the miners charge extra above the mining reward. No matter what, you have to share profit for there to be a chance anybody accepts it. Actually, it can only succeed if +51% of miners do NOT have a long term interest in Bitcoin. That includes those who might prefer to activate otherwise unprofitable mining hardware to counter an attack. 
And please tell me why PoS is not covered by the exact same attack. 
All doublespend transactions could be blacklisted alone, requiring the senders to create NEW transactions replacing both previous ones. Which means the transaction to the mixer is invalidated too, and if coinjoin was used and/or the mixer chains all transactions properly, so will the payout to you be. 
Also, if there's a risk of such an attack then the mixers wouldn't send large amounts of coins back to you quickly. 
And the suddenly missing mining power now in your secret pool will be noticed.

Try doing that even the fork was created maliciously by somebody trying to steal segwit UTXO:s. It also forces an initial delay on all segwit transactions by having to issue the non-segwit payment first, and those transactions can also be replayed to the segwit chain (not a theft, but OTOH an annoyance). 
I don't misunderstand exchanges. Exchanges simply work on some particular chain / fork. Whoever uses it to buy/sell has to have coins from the same chain / fork there (also, as a sidenote an exchange can buy from other exchanges for liquidity). People won't just instantly run away from the exchanges if there's a fork. There will be a ton of attempts at short selling and similar. There will be decent liquidity for at least a while. 
You're still assuming it is guaranteed the segwit mining will reach hashrate majority. Chances are it will be abandoned if not successful within a few days. Simply because it is too risky to disrupt the community like that. An hour long fork would very likely be overtaken with minimal disruption, but it may very well last longer. 
A forked segwit chain is equally a timebomb if it is too far behind, simply because there would be a significant risk that support is pulled back instead. It needs to be close to 50%, one at below 30% would be doomed. 
In fact, if too much time passes people might fork *against* segwit by banning its transaction format to reduce the risk of a late takeover. (I didn't miss anything) 
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:03:24
No, I \*DO\* know that for certain, simply because every user need at least one (1) unique UTXO each included in that 1 MB block to transact using anything main-chain based, during the period in which they make transactions.

A good explanation of ZKP. 
There is a solution for one type of Zero-knowledge proof that works with physical objects, illustrated with hats and hiding individual components in the solution.
There is a direct equivalent in cryptography with hash based commitment schemes. 
It is NP complete, and by earlier proof you can translate any NP-complete problem into any other. 
It works for the logical NAND gate, it can be chained arbitrarily and thus since NAND gates can build Turing complete computers you can also generate ZKP's for any algorithm a computer can run.

No, that's why I said INITIAL delay. 
That's why the old fork would softfork against segwit if too long time passes. A segwit version B would be required to reimplement it at a later time, incompatible with segwit A (current version). 
Banning segwit on a non-segwit chain is NOT a hardfork. You can always prohibit arbitary behavior with a softfork. That's how segwit bans segwit incompatible spends of segwit format anyone-can-spend transactions. 
However, a hardfork would be required if either the segwit chain or the anti-segwit chain were to change policy. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 12:58:22
You just DON'T WANT to understand, do you?
Block size is a direct proxy for the total complexity / entropy that can be expressed in the transactions in the block. That directly defines the possible rate of transactions. Every Bitcoin UTXO must be located directly in the base block and must follow the standard format. Every other kind of transaction count scaling has to happen in a second layer like LN that every node must explicitly support in order to be compatible with its transactions. Old nodes can ONLY be compatible with such scaling mechanisms via standard addresses and commitment/settlement transactions inside the base block. 
The Segwit base blocks (identical to old standard blocks, except containing also a segwit witness commitment) can be up to 1 MB, and holds the segwit transactions that now holds a hash of the transaction script + signatures instead of directly holding the signatures. 
In filesystem terms you can compare it to defragmentation, we moved signatures to the same place at the end. Or to memory virtualization on 32 bit CPUs, that still don't allow one program to use more than 4 GB RAM, but allows the OS to use multiple memory ranges for memory assignment to processes that in total exceeds 4 GB. 
The old limit stays. Old programs are still bound by them. We just added something new next to it. Only new nodes understands this new data. Everything we do with the new data is still constrained by the compatibility requirements with old nodes. That's why the segwit transactions are anyone-can-spend. 
Script data can not exceed 1 MB. Scripts are located in the base blocks. Base blocks are capped to 1 MB. Old nodes ONLY understand base blocks. They don't see or interact with the witness structure. 
New segwit nodes also use the new additional witness structure. They use it to verify the commitments in the base blocks and to validate the required signatures.
I get my facts from the developers and the specs. I don't know why you fail so badly to understand how pretty much everything works.
I don't know what you mean by "learn new cryptography". Obviously you can't just put ZKP:s inside the old blocks instead of signatures, old nodes can't verify it. You need hardfork to enable that 
But there's technically nothing stopping you from extending Segwit to do it, because the script in the base block gets to invoke still undefined witness types via new opcodes in the segwit format anyone-can-spend transaction, and a softfork can enforce that this new opcode requires a valid ZKP in the witness data. 
This would in theory allow you to commit to a Turing complete program in a P2SH address, and to commit to the output of that program in the transaction itself, and to put the ZKP in the witness data to prove the output. 
Even first-version segwit nodes would allow it if it has room for accepting new witnesses types (I believe it does, the developers have talked about planning for it).
Old blocks: [[header][coinbase transaction][transactions with script+UTXO+signatures]] 
Segwit blocks: Base blocks + witnesses data structure
Base blocks: [[header][coinbase with wtxid ***commitments***][anyone-can-spend transactions with script+wtxid ***commitment***+UTXO]] 
Witness data structure: [[witness data structure header] [transaction ID+wtxid+signature/witness]] 
Combined, what segwit nodes see;
[[header][coinbase with wtxid ***commitments***][anyone-can-spend transactions with script+wtxid ***commitment***+UTXO][witness data structure header][transaction ID+wtxid+signature/witness]] 
Old transaction ID = txid, same as before. Witness data commitment / witness ID = wtxid, a hash of the transaction data from the txid + witnesses data / signature. The wtxid input is never stored in raw form! It is only used during validation and transaction generation, and the initial broadcast. A transaction and its witness is not located next to each other on disk. 
Again, what old nodes see, the base blocks;
[[header][coinbase with wtxid ***commitments***][anyone-can-spend transactions with script+wtxid ***commitment***+UTXO]] &lt;- signatures are gone in here, 0 bytes in their place, they're replaced with hashes of a version of the transaction containing the witness. 
The transaction count is always limited to how many commitments and scripts you can fit in the 1 MB base block. Technically you could always get the same scaling improvement by opting out of all security and using anyone-can-spend P2SH with no signature required. Segwit is simply a clever way of breaking out signatures securely. 
Even segwit plus LN still caps the number of channels you can commit to in a block and thus caps simultaneous users. You CAN NOT increase the number of UTXO:s that old nodes can see and is compatible with beyond 1 MB total. You can only move out committed transactions *outside* the base block to further increase transaction count like what LN does. Increasing the total number of UTXO:s requires a hardfork to increase base block size.

Look at the various posts discussing the game theory of fork generation. If you think you have a chance of generating a fork that scores higher than the existing ones, you'll try to generate tons of them until you've got one that does score higher. This is both memory and CPU intense, and with multiple miners doing it then it is also network I/O intensive as they keep trying to "one-up" each other's forks. And because there's no real performance bound difficulty indicator, multiple miners doing this will have to guess to a greater degree what performance the other miners has, and far more blocks will be orphaned simultaneously. Everybody will try to replace the most recent blocks, hours to days back. 
Any attempt to punish nodes based on behavior or heuristics will accidentally punish poorly connected nodes (mobile nodes, for example).

I wouldn't call it against the idea of Bitcoin to fork. It is however orthogonal to its goals, it's not something Bitcoin is designed to even acknowledge. A system not interacting with the Bitcoin main chain is irrelevant to it, altcoin or not, fork or not. 
The point of Bitcoin is freedom and individual choice, enabled through the lack of gatekeepers to enforce a single central policy (which in turn is enabled by PoW mining and the game theory around it). 
There's no reason this would be in opposition to people's choice to fork the chain. The new group of users would simply follow their own new rules, and there's no gatekeepers to stop them.

Quoting myself:
Can be solved by having each cluster of fake nodes in round-robin on the same IP. All the nodes in the same cluster would know the others are fake and how to connect to their own dedicated real node. Nodes would check other nodes in their cluster don't already have a connection with whoever they're about to connect to. Fake nodes connecting to other clusters wouldn't be a problem in this setup as every fake node would know of its own cluster's real node, and each cluster pair would have no more than one interconnection. No unintended loops in the network.
Essentially all individual clusters and their respective dedicated real node would behave as one single high performance real node.

RBF = Replace-by-fee (modified version of the same transaction, same UTXO:s in), higher fee. Old version gets dropped due to lower fee. Some people who are fans of zero-confirmation transactions hates it because it could make double-spends easier, and calls it an attack despite Bitcoin intentionally NOT being meant to consider zero-confirmation transactions secure. 
CPFP = child pays for parent, where you add a new transaction claiming an UTXO from the former and spending a higher fee covering both transactions. Unless you had a reason to make a second payment for another purpose too this bloats the blockchain unnecessarily.

You're assuming the algorithms can't be gamed so that you can mine multiple blocks with different stake. 
Again, is majority stake enough for chain selection? Then isn't total stake essentially how conflicting chains is differentiated and chosen between? How does that protect against history rewrites if somebody gets access to the keys behind an old large stash which was sitting idle? 
No form of distributed checkpoints will stop bootstrap attacks. Nor will they stop network level attacks (isolation, etc). 
You don't even consider what might happen if I manage to split the network but getting them to checkpoint on different forks. 
Actually, holding old large stashes amplifies the chance of succeeding with network splits thanks to automatic checkpoints. 
And how is block age verified? Is that block REALLY 30 days old as the network tells you, or is a sybil attacker lying to you?

How about the fact that you can't open a payment channel to somebody (what LN hub interconnections are made of) without their active assistance? Kind of like how you can't join password protected wifi networks without the password. 
You can't connect to a group of hubs if not a single one of those hubs allow you to connect. 
Sure you only need to connect to one point inside the network, but for entities like banks you'll never be allowed to connect to any one of them in their private LN hub network without a ton of regulatory paperwork. 
The developers themselves describe the LN routing as a BGP like (border gate protocol, used between ISP:s, or AS:es, autonomous systems, to tell each other what's where and how to connect).

You're not looking at it from the perspective of the whole network. Not having UTXO's adds dozens of extra unnecessary double-check requirements everywhere. You add tremendous amounts of CPU load. 
That table of hashes will forever grow. UTXO sets don't. 
But with UTXO's you can spend multiple independent UTXO's on one address simultaneously in separate transactions without risk of conflict. With no UTXO's, you can't do that reliably. 
You would need very short timestamps. Which just makes the network less reliable. Otherwise I can create thousands of transactions in between two addresses and force the network to hold them all in the mempool. I could even create transactions spending from addresses that never have been funded, letting people wait for the transaction that supposedly will fund it. With UTXO's that just gets rejected right away. 
You don't seem to understand that the problem is that confirmation of transactions is slowed down by a massive margin.

And you can pay PoS minters the same way, what's your point? You can also pay them for access to old keys. And collect all old leaked keys too! 
Your suggested attack on PoW is also game theoretically inefficient, it isn't profitable unless you can get a majority in on it. They must trust your ability to pay +51% of the mining reward to take the chance. And if they do, the network can still blacklist your blocks. Then that PoW has been burnt perpetually (unlike with stake!). And punitive stake burning punishes nodes with poor connectivity, so don't try that one, you can attack honest minters trivially with DDoS to cause losses for them.

My argument is thaw eventually coins will move. If value goes up, having owned a large fraction in the past then makes attack profitable. People can probably even sell their own old deprecated private keys - if the attack succeeds then they got paid, and if it fails they still got paid and still have their current coins left. All these checkpointing mechanisms adds more risk of network split than security. 
You can never know if many addresses means many people.
With no checkpoints, what could prevent history rewrite? If there ever has been a block with low participating stake, that's an excellent point of attack where somebody can fork the chain and keep larger stake in the second chain. 
And I still see nothing that stops inflating the number of blocks in a given time period. Why wouldn't 20 blocks with a stake of 7 beat 10 blocks with a stake of 10?

I had the idea when the greenaddress.it dev tried to figure out how to make trustless green addresses (instant confirmation transactions, based on the receiver trusting a server - originally those wallets were all server hosted). He implemented a variant of it, and from there others took it further. 
And here you are demonstrating ignorance about everything that makes Bitcoin what it is, knowing less than what I did already back then. You're clueless about LN routing, how segwit is structured, the details of forking, and more. 
And you just CAN NOT stop stereotyping me into a camp I never have been part of, and you keep misreading my words and keep assuming I believe things that I just a few comments before disproved. You're attributing ideas to me that are the opposite of what I believe. You just DON'T WANT to believe I can be right about anything. Your arguments scream dunning-kruger. As soon as you see something you don't understand you assume it is because the person who said it is wrong, not because you're the one who failed to understand it.

Sure thing, because I didn't link all my prior discussions on it I clearly know nothing, because it *sounds* like mumbojumbo to you. Guess you don't even know what it means. 
False. Signatures is in an extension datastructure outside the main block. They have to be, otherwise it would be a hardfork. You can't increase the capacity in any other way beyond 1 MB of transaction data. The signatures are literally not inside the block. They're carried along with the block in the segregated datastructure. For old blocks, all they see is 1 MB blocks with script data and no signatures. Upgraded blocks see 1 MB blocks of script data + up to 8 MB of signature data (segregated witnesses) that *together* is required for full validation. 
The signatures are literally NOT embedded next to the scripts inside the Bitcoin blocks. Transactions becomes split into script data and signatures. Segregated. 
Once again, you CAN NOT have more than 1 MB script data without a hardfork. Segwit is a softfork. The script data goes into the blocks. The signatures follow alongside it. It is a two-part datastructure instead of one part like before. TOGETHER they can exceed 1 MB. But once again, THE MAIN BLOCK CAN'T! Anything else will cause old nodes to reject the blocks! 
You're lying again yourself, you're implying I'm against segwit WITH ZERO EVIDENCE! I'm actually in favor which you would know if you cared about doing your research. They're just NOT ENOUGH ALONE! That's why I'm asking for more than just segwit! 
We need segwit AND MORE!

More than zero, yes. Typically they'd only charge their customer for access and the ISP of Netflix for the amount of data they generate (send to the customer ISP). But they want to charge all three parties, the customer + ISP of Netflix + Netflix. And Netflix already pay their own ISP. The customer ISPs are supposed to ask the ISP of Netflix for more money, which they in turn can ask from Netflix. But they don't want to do that.

Sure, but they can be replaced on a daily basis for all the blockchain cares. All it takes is that a majority of people agree on what protocol rules to enforce with their software clients. 
You can't stop the users from choosing other clients if they disagree with the goals. If you hand over total control to a small group of developers then Bitcoin is de facto centralized. 
In my book, attacker mean somebody who aims to abuse the system to cause harm. Hardforking off the old rules is the total opposite. To no longer obey the rules somebody else set and to follow your own is perfectly fine. 
How would Bitcoin be decentralized if you had the ability to stop others from following other rules with their own clients?

&amp;gt; if it's so easy to hack PoS then why aren't all PoS coins dead?
Because coordination, laziness and there's far easier attacks for anybody with the skill and motivation. But you're relying entirely on that external incentives and motivations won't change. 
Mixers can coinjoin themselves. Take transactions in, transfer everything to new address in one go, pay out from that address when requested in random chunks. Doublespend the mixer and you invalidate all recent transactions it made. There's other similar strategies that hide metadata and still block doublespends.
When you do it gradually, the miners have to be powered off unless you want a high probability of only losing money on electricity until you've got 51% power. And you still have to compensate the miners for all of that time. And nothing may leak to others. Then when you have 51% you can put them on a private pool to create a doublespend chain. And you have to stay above 51% until your caught up. 
With 55% you generate 12.2 blocks per 10 blocks that the rest generate. Starting 10 blocks back, you'll have caught up after they've gotten to 45 blocks when you've finally got 55. Then you'll probably get block n+46 faster. 
That's 7h 40 minutes catching up with 55% and a 10 blocks (from the starting point) doublespend.
Good luck hiding.

There is the Bitcoin development mailing list where future changes are discussed.

Then people chose which software to run. 
The economic majority is generally what will win - you want to eat, and you want shoes without holes, and you want electricity, so what the majority of these companies accept will force the others to go along with it.
But they can't just enforce a change people don't want - if it is universally rejected, then they won't be getting paid via that fork. And they wouldn't even be able to try to force a change unless they have a huge global coalition of collaborating companies, which itself is unlikely.

U2F does, since it is linked to the browser's SSL connection, so the challenge-response can't be reused over any other SSL connection. So credentials phishing via fake sites is impossible, the response to fake sites will be unusable (assuming the browser ignores that the challenge identifies another server than the one it is connected to, and thus refuses to pass it on to the U2F token).

LN + Segwit still limits the maximum UTXO rate per block, at a few thousands. This means that even 1 MB blocks full of nothing but new transactions from new people buying into Bitcoin and establishing LN wallets would require MONTHS just to on-board ONE medium sized country's citizens. 
In other words, a Bitcoin without larger blocks CAN NOT allow for fast growth, unless we skip straight to onboarding via transactions in larger softforked extensions blocks, not touching main-block UTXO:s.

Stripped by the definition of segwit nodes. 
Whole blocks by the definition of the current Bitcoin protocol. 
Base blocks (standard Bitcoin blocks, containing segwit transactions) + witnesses = segwit full blocks. 
Let THAT sink in. 
Base blocks is the only thing old (current) nodes understand. Base blocks can only ever be 1 MB without a hardfork. 
They're just saying that now there's additional data you need for full validation. 
I don't even ever visit Keep strawmanning, like that could ever win you any argument. In fact I don't follow ANY cryptocurrency forums. I'm just still subscribed to since from back in ~2012 when people weren't so quick to attack everything that moves. By early 2016 it wasn't worth paying attention to it anymore, I just check in occasionally when I see it in my reddit frontpage. The fact that you insist on claiming I belong to that sub against all evidence just confirms that you're too lazy to confirm if your assumptions are true. 
Again. Base blocks = that thing that hold transaction scripts and defines and claims UTXOs CAN NOT be more than 1 MB without a hardfork. Segwit ADDS a new datastructure. Segwit full blocks are base blocks + the witness structure. 
The only reason you believe there's flaws and contradictions in what I'm saying is because you don't understand it. You're ascribing opinions and thoughts to me that I never have expressed based on your false preconceptions. You're inserting axioms in my logic that don't belong there based on YOUR assumptions. You're doing the logical equivalent of telling somebody that their physics simulation based on relativity is wrong, because it doesn't match your results from newtonian physics. You're refusing to evaluate the problem from the correct assumptions. 
I have literally NOT ONCE here changed stance. I have only changed wording. 
I challenge you to prove me wrong by quoting and explaining my contradictions. I can already tell you you'll fail. The flaws only exist in your mind. 
You're too desperate to cling onto your own worldview that you can't tolerate to be challenged. You refuse to acknowledge that you can be wrong, and automatically assume that others are stupid if they disagree. You are not trying to understand my arguments, you're reading them with colored lenses and searches for errors that aren't there.

The transaction hashes are hashed together in a Merkle tree hash. This includes the coinbase transaction that mints the Bitcoin subsidy coins. 
That Merkle tree hash is included in the header with a timestamp, nonce (random number) and a 2xSHA256 hash of the previous block.

With multisignature transactions, to an address under shared control. 
While there's been hypothetical discussions about covenants, no such thing is implemented today. Moving coins to another address is to surrender all control, and to allow those who control the receiving address to set the policy. 
As I said above, you can only enforce any policy on the receiver of you share control over the receiving address. Also note that the blockchain enforced rules of P2SH addresses (which is used to enforce multisig) is defined at creation of the address. Any policy beyond that must be implemented client side.

Cryptographic checkpoints using Zero-knowledge proofs of validity, to prove that your index checkpoints that declare which addresses owns what is correct. 
And to make it manageable, there would be multiple levels of checkpoints where each company / retail chain / payment processor gathers all their transactions into one index that they create a Zero-knowledge proof for, and then all these indexes gets merged to create the one that the miners work with (with another Zero-knowledge proof). Multiple levels of compression, essentially.

Yes. HD wallets with BIP32 allows for publishing the public key roots for branches. I recommend making sure the wallet you are using have hardened derivation (or else the master private key for the full wallet can be recovered if a private key from the branch is revealed - hardened derivation use hashing so only that one branch is compromised, not the full tree, if a key is leaked).
Also, see stealth addresses. You can publish that to the world, because ECDSA key exchange is used to create new addresses that nobody but the sender and receiver can know about.

Nodes would check other nodes in their cluster don't already have a connection with whoever they're about to connect to. Fake nodes connecting to other clusters wouldn't be a problem in this setup as every fake node would know of its own cluster's real node, and each cluster pair would have no more than one interconnection. No unintended loops in the network.
Essentially all individual clusters and their respective dedicated real node would behave as one single high performance real node.

I see your argument. It just doesn't make sense to me. You're assuming the merchants will be able to respond fast enough, and to not blame Bitcoin and just eventually disable all Bitcoin payments. You're assuming they want to have to keep track of these risks and the current status. IMHO the risks are too great, and the response time will often be too slow. You're also assuming the people in the shop also are the ones who have read up on what doublespends are.

Your wallet client stores your physical address details and stuff like that. The store has a BIP70 URL encoded in a Qr code. The moment you scan that code (or click the link), your wallet ask their server what's on the receipt right that moment, what the sum to pay is, and tells it your shipping address. You're asked to verify all those details and click Buy. The merchant server sends you a signed copy of that data, and your wallet client stores that and sends the payment.

You could tie it to an API from the "electricity provider" that asks for the current price (assuming variable price contract), adds a markup the of your choice, and allows the customer to use Bitcoin payment channels for the payment. So the customer creates a series of transactions that each replace the previous one, paying for what the customer already have used or for what he will use, as he goes. The most recent transaction in the chain goes. 
As one example, the customer can pay on a per-Wh basis, and you tell him what the price will be for each Wh and for how long that price offer is valid. 
Calculation example: during 12:00 and 12:15 the price is $0.1/kWh, your markup is 15%. The customer uses 60W continously and so uses 15Wh, for a price of 0.1\*1.15\*0.015 = 0.17 cents. 
For longer time periods and larger loads (multiply both by 20, for example) you'll get larger totals, in whole dollars. 
You'd run the server providing the pricing API.

A Zero-knowledge proof is a mathematical proof that a particular algorithmic / mathematical statement is completely correct (and also reveals no other knowledge by itself than the fact that it is true). They can be generated for every single operation a computer can perform since they can be generated for arbitary chains of NOR gates, gates which allows you to build generic Turing complete computers. 
So you could for example prove "this hash H1 represents a list of valid transactions that make the following verified valid changes to the Bitcoin UTXO set in the latest block with the hash H2: Remove UTXO A, B and C, add UTXO X, Y and Z" 
Then you could even generate such an index for the entire blockchain as a form of UTXO checkpoint. Then you only need headers + that statement with its Zero-knowledge proof to verify all new transactions. Then those new transactions can be replaced again by a new index with a Zero-knowledge proof.

Gregory Maxwell:


How else can you send a full valid block WITHOUT just the witness gates to an old non-segwit node and have it validation? 
You're saying the signatures are inside the Bitcoin block, not parallel (segregated) in segwit and yet increases blocksize. That's impossible. How would one nodes accept those blocks then? They couldn't! If the main block is larger than 1 MB they reject the block. 
There's commitments of the transactions hashed with their witness data in the main block. But the witness data is stored outside the main block. 




Note: old nodes CAN NOT validate partial blocks. Classical blocks with stripped signatures fails to validate. Again, signatures are outside of the transaction script data in segwit. They're only committed to. 




It can not get more clear than this;




That very last sentence proves me right, from the mouth of the developers themselves. You are simply wrong.

Eventual consistency being used for transactions. 
Because insane programmers will allow the system to get a negative balance before achieving consistency. 
But they won't achieve FINANCIAL consistency because they will be exploited and lose money, *those negative balances will not be paid back*. 
Just because the system figures out that the real balance ends up as negative after subtracting 3 from 4 twice, that don't mean the company will survive. ACID prevents negative balances from ever occurring, eventual consistency doesn't. The latter is just one big invitation to thieves.

Bitcoin is all about agreeing on a globally shared history of events.
They are encoded in a database on append-only mode, and we call thar database the blockchain (because it is a chain of blocks appended to each other).
To create a valid block, you collect a number of transactions and add a "coinbase" transaction, then you perform the mining with hashes based on that data (plus the rest of the header data). That coinbase is were new coins are introduced - as a part of creating a valid block the miner gets to claim a number of coins for himself, and in that transaction he says were they should be sent. 
The miners can then spend those coins because everybody else can track the origin of those coins to those blocks, and confirm that they follow the rules. 
Every transaction you make have one part that says "spend coins from this transaction output here" and one part that says "and coins to these addresses here" which then creates new transaction outputs which your receiver will then later on claim. 
Every transaction can be compared to cashing in a number of cheques and creating new ones. And the blockchain is how we make sure nobody can spend reach cheque more than once.
It can also be compared to melting gold bars deposited to your vaults and forming new ones which you deposit to the vaults of the receivers.

No. I'm saying transactions have two SEPARATE parts in segwit - scripts and witness data. 
Scripts goes in the main blocks, the signatures fits in the witness data structure and is committed in the blockchain. Old nodes DO NOT SEE SIGNATURE DATA, because it did not exist in the old-form blocks. It CAN NOT be a softfork otherwise! Segwit nodes receives that data parallel to the main block data, confirms the commitment and validates the signatures. 
Segwit nodes may prune old already validated signatures from their block store, only storing script data, and assume validity after the fact with no sideeffects.
Segwit blocks = old form blocks with signature commitment + signature data.
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:04:01
We can do a bit of both. 
Although my favorite approach is Zero-knowledge proof secured UTXO set compressed checkpoints. All you would need is the block headers up to the block the checkpoint was made for, a copy of the checkpoint with its proof, and the newest blocks after it, and you could securely validate the full Bitcoin state without needing the full blockchain. 
However, even such a ZKP checkpoint system would likely need either a hardfork or extension blocks just to let the blockchain handle enough LN channel commitments / settlements. 
Even a perfectly functioning LN can't handle the volume of one country's worth of transactions at once, even in a Bitcoin with Segwit. There's just not enough room for the commitments and settlements in 1 MB blocks.

You used to be able to talk to Google Talk users from your own XMPP server. Now it has become Google Hangouts, and if you try to talk to Hangouts users from your own XMPP server you will face total silence. 
Also known as private networks, data silos, and whatever else you wanna call it. 
LN is exactly the same. You can't send LN payments to clients on hubs that refuse to talk to you. Most people will NOT be on your private hub. Most will use banks, and maybe have one or two extra accounts on a regional hub.
There's will be hundreds of distinct independent groups of LN nodes. A lot of them will be interconnected, but that will mostly be private business and small scale use.

I'm getting tired of this. If you want comprehensive answers that explain EXACTLY how implausible it is, ask on the Bitcoin development mailing list. 
With UTXO's, there's spent UTXO's which you purge from the index because you'll never need them again, and the currently unclaimed UTXO's that you keep in the index. In the index = unspent. There's already a transaction in the mempool claiming it = doublespend. 
So let's say you've got time limited transactions with no UTXO's. A block reorganization can invalidate payments. And anybody can set their limit in the far far future. 
Depend on unconfirmed deposits = *everything* when you spend many times from the same address while you have some incoming transactions too. You don't know which of your outgoing transactions will get rejected if one of your incoming transactions won't confirm.

FYI, MD5 isn't good enough anymore. It is too easy to generate collisions.
Edit: 
You can trivially generate two documents or executable files or media files with identical hashes. 
One is clean, the other is malicious. You tell people to identify the file on the MD5 hash. They accept it because the file they have seen is clean. 
Then later on they are given the malicious file with the same hash and do not notice the difference.
This is done by calculating suffixes to file A and file B. These suffixes cause the new hashes to become identical for these two files. But nobody knew the old hashes, because nobody was ever given a copy without the suffix.

You can't force a timelock for the receiver on an individual transaction. 
And a P2SH address is a hashed static script that don't take input data from the incoming transactions, so it's expiry date is fixed. 
But you can use the public keys from a HD wallet to create a series of P2SH addresses each with dates further ahead into the future, transferring between them in order. Then you only need to know the HD root key OR the receiving address' private key, P2SH template and the specified dates to be able to recover the coins.

Defection isn't a problem in this case as that means accepting a loss = eventual bankruptcy, so they're assumed to not do that if they're rational and don't have external incentives (like being paid to attack Bitcoin).

Uneducated amateur confirmed.
Adding entropy is done with one small symmetric key. See AES-GCM, stream ciphers like ChaCha20, and more. The additional entropy is MIXED with the message, NOT APPENDED. The size is 1:1 (except for padding and authentication tags, which are done in addition to encryption). 
XOR, the one time pad, is actually unbreakable if the key is random and unknown to the attacker. The problem is that key reuse breaks the security.

Yes, that's a bug.

Now imagine it takes an hour for a block to be solved on this particular occasion, and this person is on a shopping spree in a mall... 
A single large transfer being accepted earlier than it should breaks the whole chain of potentially dozens of transactions. 
And just imagine exchanges trying to deal with this...

Then add changes to your index from the new relevant transactions.
ZKP based checkpointing could turn Bitcoin into a rolling blockchain system, where you only need headers for old blocks to sync new nodes. Then you fetch and validate the most recent index / checkpoint, and the changes made since.

When everybody accepts usage of multisignature arbitration. Can't say what the timeframe for that is, but the problem isn't technical. 
Bitcoin is programmable money with international interoperability. That impacts just about everything. Companies gets lower financial overhead, simpler audits, lower fees, faster transactions, more control over their funds, better overview, and can provide a much wider range of features to customers. Regular people gets lower fees, practically eliminates the risk of identity theft á la Target, gets much greater simplicity when using international services, and gets access to many more new services (have you even looked at what's available?) and of course better overview. 
That's just a fraction of it all. BIP70 would even give you an Amazon style one-click experience at every single Bitcoin merchant. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:07:11
Blockchains would work well for the announcements related to it.
Using them for the actual vote - even with Zerocoin style math, that would be complex and inefficient compared to the alternatives.
To resist censorship effectively you also need a two step protocol with a commitment scheme (you can prove miners reject your committed and correct vote), which just makes it impractical for most people AND exposes everybody who wants to use that as an anti-censorship mechanism to personal attacks in that timeframe between submitting the two different parts, where they can force you to show your vote. 
Anything that's single-step for the voters with a blockchain would IMHO have to allow for multiple "vote fractions" like the paper based 3-ballot votes where two ballots cancel out and the third counts. This could be implemented with a public deterministic hash of the private key of the voter + the identifying constant of the vote + some type of fraction identifier, and a Zero-knowledge proof that this hash is correct and tied to this vote fraction.
So if you have 3 vote fractions you can show one (unless you wiped your traces of it), and claim you have no others. In reality you canceled it out. Creating multiple fractions that conflict would produce the same fraction identifier hash = rejected as double voting. I'm not an expert at math (have not done anything more complex than trigonometry and derivatives), so I'm not sure what else you'd need to prove to make sure the multiple vote fractions are "tied together" mathematically as one vote (so fractions supposed to cancel out really does cancel out, vs looking like 3 votes instead of one). I'm not sure how to make the math for vote fractions recreate the effects of the physical paper 3-ballot system. I would also like to allow for a user determined amount of fractions as long as you can prove they cancel out correctly to have the effect of one vote. Maybe you'd just skip the cancelling out requirement, it would probably only work as intended anyway if you can guarantee all fractions are counted...

How does that work with multiple transactions in and out involving one address, all in the same block?

Because you shift the complexity from UTXO selection to absolutely everything else. 
Even with no change outputs, you still need to ensure every transaction is unique and only counted once. But since one transactions never can be pruned because they never really are claimed once and for all, you need to maintain a list of hashes of all of transactions ever so old transactions aren't repeated. That's worse than a prunable UTXO set. 
You can never be sure all transactions verify at the first try. At best you double the processing requirements on average as failed verifications are delayed. But when can you REALLY remove them from your mempool? What if two transactions ended up reaching different parts of the network? You can't drop known bad transactions from your mempool, you'd increase network load if you did since the nodes who got transaction 1 would need to broadcast transactions 2 multiple times to get the rest of the network to accept it once they got transaction 1.

SegWit doesn't decrease actual blocksize for miners, though, only apparent blocksize for non-miners who don't prioritize performing full validation. Miners will see the larger blocks, and interestingly enough almost nobody's commenting on that despite how fervently previous suggestions were fought with arguments like it will destroy mining through latency. 
Oh, and SegWit actually could have resulted in the same mess if there were people to panic about the mining latency or insecurity of non-full validation (because they have previously). They just chose not to.

You're forgetting that quantum computers are running in repeated-single-round mode by design. Programming that round, configuring the state of the qubits, adds massively to the slowdown both because of complexity of setting up the entanglement probabilities and because of error correction. Reading it is practically instant compared to setting up a round. 
Not computing the Merkle tree root on the QC gives you the entropy of the 32 bit nonce and the timestamp as your cap before you need to reprogram the whole QC state. You're spending tons of classical computational power too on every reprogram, don't forget that. At best you just reduced those maybe 40 bits of entropy it can search to 20, then the system needs to detect "no match" and continue with another Merkle tree root. ASICs search that in minutes or seconds. Can you hit &lt;30 seconds for 2^20 quantum rounds? 
Also, the previous block hash is input data. The nonce is a variable.

Name one method besides proof-of-work that can't be gamed / abused.

My hope is that Zero-knowledge proofs together with Merkle tree hashes and smart data structures will allow you to create one universal blockchain with maximal pruning capabilities (Zero-knowledge proofs would allow you to create compressed indexes proven correct, allowing you to store just them + headers and nothing else). 
With that you'd have multiple data structures in one chain, like merging the concept of tree chains and side chains with Namecoin and Ethereum / Counterparty. 
One of them would be the Bitcoin data structure, which would still reward miners as usual. Once could be Namecoin. One could be for timestamping. And you could register data structures of your own with arbitary rules (including altcoins). And even have rules for interaction across data structures (atomic swaps, etc). 
But money is a form of communication, and people don't want to use more than one. Network effects make it hard for competitors to get anywhere at all. You don't want to learn more than one system, and you want to use what everybody else is using.

You generate a secret codeword A. You publish a hash of codeword A in a timestamped system (newspaper, blockchain, etc). 
You compose your message. You append you codeword A. You generate a new codeword B and add the hash of codeword B in the message. You hash this full message. You publish this hash in a timestamped system. 
You publish the message. Because it contains the codeword and provably was composed before anybody else could have known the codeword, people know you wrote the message. 
You can repeat this infinitely as you now have the hash of a new codeword timestamped the same way.

Then you should understand how isolation layers work. You can build many small single function cores that never reveal their secret keys and that validate all inputs before processing them. Then you build more advanced features on top of this in many layers, keeping sensitive data far far away from untrusted user input. And all this can be mathematically validated to provably not leak information no matter what an attacker send across the wires as long as the blueprint is followed.

Were you here from the beginning? 
I was watching since early 2011. The derisiveness were all directed against the people wanting larger blocks in the beginning. People spouting bullshit on how their shitty laptops is the standard for how much resources full validation are allowed to require from a computer to remain peer to peer.
The same people using bullshit arguments on "what Bitcoin is supposed to be" while ignoring that Satoshi himself talked about full nodes being data centers one day and just set the 1 MB cap as a TEMPORARY spam prevention measure.
People keep forgetting that the security was supposed to come from cryptographic algorithms, not from harassing people with different opinions out of the community. Zero-knowledge proofs, smarter compression / batching mechanisms, etc... *Those* were meant to be the real solutions to make sure Bitcoin stayed equal for all. 
There was absolutely nothing sane about the attacks against larger blocks.

That logic is broken beyond belief. You're making an argument from the status quo, with a built-in assumption that load never will increase significantly. An argument from disbelief alone. You're saying dust makes it in now - but with higher competition, what you today sees as important will be rejected because others pay more. It is demonstrably false that all transactions that matter will fit at once. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 09:29:37


Which took years before it got presented, and of course it demonstrates the not-invented-here syndrome as small-blockers proposed it (not the same people as the extremists, though) 


Patently false, you know very well that there's no such thing as a 1MB limit where all important transactions will fit in within. With forced scarcity, everybody raising their fee will kick out somebody else who no longer can afford to use the system. And regular users won't afford it at all. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 21:59:16
A: Yes there is. Nobody wants to process more data than they need, LN would happen even with infinite blocks to spare CPU cycles. And you could even have fee-per-byte increase exponentially to disincentivize too large transactions, plus a coin-age penalty for immediate on-chain re-spending. People also want to reduce network load / latency = less data transferred.
Not to mention that LN and similar multisig batching systems allows you to safely use thin clients with minimal trust requirements = phone / smartcard friendly wallets. 
B: The value could also be remaining stable instead of increasing because it has filled its niche in the market completely given its current capabilities (the current users can deal with it - future potential users stay away). 
C: A blockchain where you can essentially become locked out because you no longer can pay the fees doesn't sound like it will help you be sovereign or to transact uncensorably.
Edit: great, more downvotes instead of attempting to prove anything. If you think you're right, you should have evidence for your claims. No amount of willpower can make facts go away.

That only makes sense if the OS stored in the blockchain can not be updated. If it can be updated, the update mechanism can be a target.

There's nothing special about the checkpoints as such here. They are just mathematical statements. 
The thing is that the Zero-knowledge proofs allow you to verify that the statements are true.
The checkpoint data says address X has Y coins, and the ZKP allows you to know it is true, because the person who generated the checkpoint data and the ZKP processed the blockchain data with the blockchain validator code running inside a ZKP generator.

If renaming should be attempted, you would first need to come up with a better and more accurate and intuitive explanation of the thing in question, which is an improvement over the old ones AND where the tie to the new name is more obvious and intuitive than the old one is from any of the descriptions. Not to mention the name must be memorable. 
Then you can start educating people and casually use the new name as part of the description, like saying "$OldName, also called $NewName" or similar. If it catches on and people clearly understand it better, THEN you can move ahead with renaming it  all over.

Sure is. And it used to be simple discussions with no factions. 
The problem is that some groups of people started to polarize everything by taking more extreme positions and attacking everybody who disagreed.
It basically started with some people suggesting bigger blocks to avoid hitting a capacity ceiling too fast (usage was rising, lightning network wasn't even an idea yet), so usage of the network would remain smooth for a while, while the hyper-conservative side over time decided to completely stonewall the issue, with a variety of arguments against it, mostly worried about the risks a raised block size could cause (network collapse due to latency, dwindling peer numbers, needing to build a fee market, whatever else). They had other priorities and *really* didn't want to spend time talking about bigger blocks. 
The problem really isn't at all that they don't approve of any individual suggestion - the problem is that they refuse to have the discussion at all, and won't contribute in creating a proposal everybody can agree to. They just don't want bigger blocks, so they ain't going to contribute in figuring out how it could be done safely and future proof. Since then pretty much every proposal in favor of larger blocks have been met with open hostility, screaming "lack of concensus", "dangerous", etc. Just asking how they think larger blocks could be implemented can get you under attack by some people saying it must never happen at all. They'll keep telling you there's no concensus, and they sure insist on keeping it that way. 
And of course being met with hostility for trying to solve a perceived problem is going to create a separate faction, where the like minded people with the opposite opinion gather. And then we naturally get more extreme vocal minorities on both sides, and both sides calling the other side evil and malicious. And shit like small-blockers DDoS:ing XT nodes just for flagging that they are in favor of larger blocks, and large-blockers claiming conspiracy theories against large blocks by contributors to LN development and more shit like that. 
And when we got vocal opposing factions, then the community at large who initially was indifferent often starts to split up and take sides between factions.
Thus multiple subreddits and bans in all directions and screams about censorship, etc...

Part of why things are like this is that Bitcoin Qt was never designed to be a configurable cryptocurrency template.

Much of that legal overhead is a result of the transactions going through intermediate banks in multiple countries. So that legal overhead is smaller with Bitcoin. Many of the laws involved are there because those banks involved are all different groups of humans that must trust each other to manage credit and transfer of capital across borders honestly and correctly. Etc... 
Bitcoin reduces all that to a very minimal degree of human trust in something closer to one to three organizations (dealing with one multinational company also functioning as an exchange vs one remittance company per country + one external exchange). 
Capital transfer and credit is massively simplified. Number of humans involved is greatly reduced. Number of jurisdictions involved is reduced. And so on.

LN has been discussed literally for years and isn't ready yet. And LN alone is simply insufficient as I proved with basic math before, it can't handle global populations with 1 MB blocks. 
Who's ever said bigger blocks is the only solution!? I've never seen anybody say that. It is just simply a necessity, one of many. Bigger blocks AND Lightning Network, AND future Zero-knowledge proofs &amp; checkpoints, AND SegWit, etc... 
Every individual proposal increases the scalability a little, but they all have limitations. Combining them will be necessary, and bigger blocks is part of that. 




exists BECAUSE fanatic small blockers drove out the people demanding bigger blocks. There's no simple "so what" - this is toxic behavior that's dividing the community. 


I didn't say code, but I could bring up game theory as an example. The probability of attacks on zero confirmation transactions succeeding as well. I've seen them have to backtrack on statements before, a few times of which I was one of the people arguing on the other side. 




This is 90% of the problem right here. You're saying you KNOW we'll have the solutions ready before it becomes a problem! I don't want to take that risk! 




Even SegWit + lightning can't handle the entire economy of just one (1) continent actively using it with just 1 MB blocks. You'll frequently have payment channels time out (or funds being locked up for months after notaries gets hacked!), exposing all participants to either fraud or sabotage. 


Irrelevant strawman. 1 MB blocks can't even handle one continent's worth of mortgage payments, some people won't be able to afford to pay for the fees. It doesn't matter what it gets used for - it is inherently limited to a small user base, and only the highest payer gets in. If you want Bitcoin to be used for actually valuable things only, you'll better pray nobody who can afford higher fees comes in and kick you out with their less worthwhile transactions. 
Not to mention that it won't go 125 years until Zero-knowledge proofs are able to provide for secure checkpointing where you securely can reduce all data preserved to the block headers (tiny) + current UTXO set + Zero-knowledge proofs (tiny).

Of course full blocks wasn't even considered to be any kind of problem or risky, and you couldn't get them to answer how they would handle it except for simple quips like "lightning network" (which I'm all for, but with an uncertain timeline that's like completely rejecting an engine warning light for years because one day soon you'll have the engine upgraded instead...

1: It is slower 
2: That naive approach will make all kinds of series of transactions fail. Almost everything that does more than move funds from one rarely used address to one other rarely used address will require things to be done in one particular order. You will force the addresses to only be used once to be able to transact at any kind of decent speed - in which case you again have no advantage over UTXO's. 
Nobody that gets paid often and spend often could tolerate it. Too many transactions would be outright invalidated. 
3: Trying to speed it up will require a lot of bruteforce searches to find more efficient arrangements. 
4: It breaks NoRiskWallet and other usage of chained transactions that emulate oracles. 
5: Old unconfirmed transactions can never be permanently invalidated. If you replace an invalidated transaction to complete a payment (adding funds from another address, for example), you must stop using that address to not risk that transaction becoming valid again later (new funds added).

Fired how? They just wouldn't enforce your softfork. You only win if the economic majority rejects the non-softfork blocks. And even then those majority miners can still stall your chain in retaliation through a 51% attack (because you lacked miner majority).

And Microsoft has a cap at 16 characters. I agree it's stupid.

FYI: Authentication code should typically always take the same amount of time to finish. But if you allow infinite length passwords, the password hashing algorithms will get slowed down a bit to much. So either you slow down login for everybody or cap the password length, or you have do accept that your login system is vulnerable to "oracle attacks" through timing.

Doesn't even matter what it is. You're either a scammer, banker, or criminal or authoritarian or corporate puppet or spammer or moon-math idiot or whatever else. 
You can't discuss network simulations, you can't advocate proposals, you can't discuss algorithm security, somebody's gonna scream "no concensus" and stonewall you and rally people against you. 
You're assuming both your point 1 &amp; 2 are one-dimensional. Couldn't it be that there's really some topic they don't know better? Or that not all of their priorities are the best for the community? 


Irrelevant 




Irrelevant, because you're implicitly assuming that non-dust transactions won't exceed 1 MB. As soon as they do, you're kicking out genuine transactions because people can't afford them. All auctions with more buyers than items have losers. 


There's over 7 billion people. 1440 MB a day of transactions means 172 bits / 21 bytes per person per day. That's much less than a full standard transaction per day. Even with lightning network, enrollment for all these people would mean that it would likely take many weeks of filling the blockchain with nothing else than *time limited* (typically weeks / months) payment channel commitment transactions to get most people into the system so they can start making and receiving payments. 
And every pair of nodes that has to communicate transactions must make their own channel commitments, including the big transaction routing nodes and all user facing nodes and corporate nodes and banking nodes and retail nodes and finance nodes..... 
Timestamping the state of keybase.io daily isn't spam. Namecoin isn't either, nor onename. People paying their mortgages isn't unimportant, and so on. 
A 1MB Bitcoin with no notable changes will never become anything but a tiny niche. Reserved for usage by a few. 
The best hope we have are efficient Zero-knowledge proofs and efficient checkpointing based on them, and even then we'll need larger blocks for the metadata that will need to be stored. 
But just making these suggestions will get you under attack here. I've been attacked practically every time I discuss solutions. 
Just in case you wonder what I've contributed with, I'm the guy that came up with the timelocked multisignature notary style addresses for "green addresses" that the dev behind Greenaddress.it were first to implement. You know, the scheme that then later on got payment channels bolted on to create lighting network.

I know how encryption works. And after taking a closer look on how it's used here, passwords are typically distributed together with the message ID, and the message is decrypted by the browser running Javascript given from the server.
Several risks there:
Somebody who can intercept the link gets the password too unless the user intentionally split them up and sent both parts through separate secure channels.
The server can send any Javascript it wants to read the message both when uploaded and when decrypted if the users don't check the Javascript from the server.

Then you have to meet in person, as I said.


For quantum cryptography, that "key" you share in advance IS which measurements the quantum machine should take. How exactly did you think it was applied?


FYI, most quantum crypto is just (symmetric) key distribution. In which case that key can be used for AES without involving anything quantum, because you're going to use classical algorithms anyway for the actual encryption.


Meet in person. And that's the whole point, with quantum computers it isn't even secure against MITM in the first place if you don't meet in person. So if there is ANY strong public key crypto, it is not less secure in any way than quantum crypto.
Also, take a look at [Lamport signatures]( (hash based), which can be used for authentication assuming there is any secure classical key exchange algorithm (which isn't exactly the same as public key crypto), after which you still can establish secure encrypted channels remotely (after sharing Lamport public keys, probably in person).

It uses scrypt to generate an encryption key, and scrypt isn't weak to bruteforce or known to reduce the entropy. I am assuming AES is used for the encryption. Even if it would be AES in ECB mode, it's used to encrypt a completely random input (the Bitcoin key), and since AES itself is strong it will not leak anything at all about what either the scrypt output (encryption key) is or what the Bitcoin key is.

Up to ~80 bits (2^80 that is) is assumed to be bruteforcable with today's hardware (even if that would be by some massive servers).
Note that we ALWAYS want a serious security margin to remain secure for at least several decades, so assume ~90 bits will become bruteforcable (note that you can simultaneously look for all addresses in the blockchain, potentially making it profitable enough).
90 bits = 2^90 = 1 237 940 039 285 380 274 899 124 224 = 1.24 * 10^27 while log2(1 * 10^20 ) = 66.4 bits. 64 bit keys have been broken before in various types of efforts.
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:55:47
80 bits of entropy is estimated to be crackable currently with massive server farms. That is the same as a maximum of 2^80 possible passwords, which is 1 208 925 819 614 629 174 706 176 possible passwords 1.2 * 10^24 ).
Diceware uses a wordlist to pick from of 6^5 = 7776 words. 8 words phrase = 8^6^5 = 1 237 940 039 285 380 274 899 124 224 ( 1.2 * 10^27 ). That's an entropy of log2( 8^6^5 ) = log2( 1.2 * 10^27 ) = 90 bits of entropy. 9 words: 95 bits. 10 words: 100 bits.
Using more than that is good to keep a security margin.

Well then, good thing practically nobody did that. People wanted to get a concensus on how to do it and made plenty of suggestions. Even the most extreme proposals were almost all just meant to get a discussion started. Even XT depended on majority support. 
They were all rejected with no reasonable counterproposals ever being made until only recently. 
There's literally nothing that's being applied to SegWit to enable miners to handle the increases in data volume that could not be done without it. SegWit really only creates a second level of the SPV mode - you need to fetch the extra witness data (signatures) to do full validation. So now there's full validation with raw blocks + witness data, transaction syntax validation and SPV block header validation. 
To call them all scammers is itself malicious. You know perfectly well 1MB can't work forever, and that there's plenty of people who honestly want to solve scalability. By being actively hostile towards people just because they're asking for bigger blocks is actively hurting Bitcoin. You're hurting Bitcoin's image, you're hurting development of better proposals, you're polarizing the community, you're preventing real concensus from forming around valid proposals. *YOU* are doing that. And you need to stop doing that, by ending the hostility.

I have read up on it before. It still can't verify what human being is on the other end, so you need a shared key, and you already agreed on that. But what you CAN'T have is a tiny key and still send large messages (otherwise you can't use any unconditionally secure authentication).
If you want to have a tiny key (rather than one whose size is a logarithm of the message size) then you already assume there exists cryptographically strong constructs like strong hashes or ciphers, and then you no longer need the quantum part.
And once again, it is not yet proven that the one time pad created by the quantum key distribution can be fully secure, since no set of assumptions made by QKD system developers and correctly implemented yet have been proven 100% correct and flawless.


And the overhead would be massive. You'd need to "rekey" constantly with megabyte sized key material. And you're still assuming QKD  actually can be implemented securely.

Each block has the hash of the previous block, a timestamp, a random number and a list of transactions. 
To be valid, all transactions in it must be valid and the hash value of the block must be below a given target value (calculated using the difficulty recalculation algorithm). 
The reference to the previous block by including it's hash makes it a hash chain, or block chain. 
You find a valid block by testing various random numbers and reordering the transactions, until you find a combination with a low enough hash value. That's what mining is.

It wasn't exactly that. It wasn't about *efficient* under P=NP, but more like "not less efficient than that Wegman scheme authentiation while still secure". And there's still no contradiction there. I wasn't saying that SHA256 would be secure under those assumptions. I was saying there's likely *something* that would be secure under those assumptions. And we can't be sure how efficient it would be. But I *think* it would be more efficient than Wegman scheme authentication.


You're actually not ENTIRELY correct there. P=NP doesn't say exactly how long something would have to be to gain a certain level of security. It's entirely possible that you could have far shorter inputs and gain that security. What it says is more along the lines of *what kind of security increase* (measured in operations required in this particular case) you get if you change certain numbers, like input length.


Sure, there would be fewer rounds. You can go from (key bits/hash length/tags) 256/64/4 &gt; 512/64/8 &gt; 8192/128/128, where the latter would be able to sign tons of data. But then you still just have a very small number of actual tags, which would require you to create a large one time pad like the 1 TB one discussed before, so that you can reuse the key to be able to sign a large number of messages. And unless tags are verified within hours from transmission, an attacker will have a chance at simply replacing the messages with his own data and forging the tags (note that you'll have below 2^60 security when you start this QKD scheme if you use just 256 bits), allowing for a full MITM.

Not entirely accurate. There is a private ECDSA key, a public key generated from that using the ECDSA algorithm and then the addresses are hashes of the public key. 
So technically you don't store keypairs, only the private key and hash based addresses (the public key can always easily be calculated again from the private key), but it is effectively the same thing.

ECDSA sep256k1 is used for the wallets, and replacing SHA256 is trivial (if you can get consensus behind the change, which is likely if SHA256 gets broken). And for ECDSA, all we need is to add support for new address types with the algorithm of choice (ideally and likely far in advance of a full crack), all it takes is to let the new addresses begin with another character. People can move their coins between any address type they wish.

You don't understand the practical issues. How is the price plugged in to the algorithm as input data in a secure verifiable way? If somebody plugs in the wrong value, how do you reject that value? If somebody hacks the exchanges to change the apparent exchange value, what do you do? How on earth to you create a protocol for agreeing to a single global exchange rate in a verifiable and secure way?
It's not enough for it to be open, because WEP encryption for WiFi is also open, but it sucks anyway. It needs to be properly designed in a secure way too. Openness is just a way for the general public to verify the security, and help figuring out how to fix it if a flaw is found.


Bitcoin isn't a method to agree on an exchange rate. The exchange rates exists outside the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin is a token generation and transfer protocol. You can't securely verify the exchange rates.

Not really brute force, but rather through exploiting the ability to alter the probability of the various outcomes in quantum effects in atoms. Things like entanglement, where the probability usually is 50/50 - by manipulating it in clever ways, you can have it do computations for you. And the cool thing is that the answer you want is the one who is made the most probable output, rather than pure random noise. It's as if it tests all the possible inputs/outputs at once.
I seriously don't think there will be any efficient SHA256 bruteforce quantum algorithms anytime soon, or quantum computers powerful enough to run them (having thousands of "qubits", bits that are in superposition until measured, at which point they take certain values following the probabilities that your specified quantum algorithm results in). It's just not the kind of algorithm that they do well.

IMHO doing Shamir's secure sharing scheme with enough pieces and a reasonable treshold + storing that in Qr code form with maximum error correction should be OK. At least as long as the ink and paper will last for as long as you need it to. Store the pieces in various different places, like one or two in a bank vault, maybe one or two at home, etc...

If you're going to search through patents, use Tor in a separate browser and wipe the history afterwards. Even patents that looks 100% irrelevant to what you're doing could be interpreted as covering your work, so you can still get hit.

Anything else will just put you at risk.

Here's a list of things such an algorithm has to fulfill, *at minimum*;
* Have precisely predictable properties. We need to be able to fine-tune the difficulty.
* Be precisely verifiable. We need to be able to know with a high certainty how many rounds of it that the miners have run. We need to know for certain if we actually have a match or not.
* Be consistent (have something like constant-time or constant-work rounds). This is very important for predictability. It also helps with assuring security in general (see points below).
* Not having any loopholes. Somebody might for example find a way to cheat the system by finding a way to manipulate the input to decrease the amount of work a round takes, or to find a way to generate "match" sooner without actually performing that much useful work. I bet that most potential useful-work non-cryptographic algorithms would fail here, because whatever you use to determine if an output should be considered a match or not can be gamed such that one no longer does meaningful work when "mining".
* Have fast verification. Without that, it's essentially useless. Blockchain syncs could easily end up take 20x as much time.
* Be useful. Somebody must actually be able to do something meaningful with the proof-of-work outputs in the blockchain. Why use it otherwise?
* Have small outputs. We don't want a massively bloated blockchain.
* Be efficient. It should not be more profitable to build dedicated hardware/use FPGAs for doing the computations than to have an altcoin mining with it.
* Be future proof. Some day you might want to swap the algorithm for something else, since new discoveries (whatever the source is) may have made those computations worthless. You'd need to find something new to work on. Though weather simulations could be resistant to that problem to some degree, except that simulation algorithms will certainly improve over time there as well.
Edit: Also;
* Be fair. Everybody has to have an equal chance of successfully mining a block. This means that the problems can't be known in advance (so nobody has more significantly time to work on them), and has to be distributed fast in the network.
Others can fill in whatever they think is missing in my list.
@_date: 2013-07-23 00:30:18
So basically Web of Trust, PGP style.
And no, it's not possible to do securely. Do you realize that when you need to trust any and all individuals when they claim that they know a random person X you can't meet, they're honest? Because how else will your grandmother join the web of trust? And once you trust them for that, they can add any number of random people. Even if you catch the guy doing it, what do you do if it was a group of people doing it and you don't know who all the conspirators were? You won't know which people are fake and which aren't, so you can't just drop all the people who those guys added since others might already have vouched for them, so then you need to find *those* people and confirm they're real, and even if nobody else vouched for them, how do you know the guy who was adding fake people didn't just add another 20% fake people while adding real people? So you'd otherwise drop 100 real people from the network to get rid of 20 fake ones.
Once again, you JUST CAN NOT DO IT, because it REQUIRES ABSOLUTE TRUST IN ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY.
Standard Web-of-trust works because it's only local for you, and you can define who you trust and how much, and you're free to distrust others and reject various other people as fake or malicious. But all those assumptions who makes PGP's web of trust strong and useful are thrown away when you're trying to build a global concencus of who's who and who's not. There is NO WAY AT ALL to do this in a decentralized manner. There's no way at all to prove that you're you and that you're exactly one unique human being and that you aren't trying to claim to be several people only with digital algorithms.
Who's to say you DON'T have a twin, for example? What algorithm will prove your false claim to be wrong?

Things like DES are usually not called ciphers, but encryption algorithms. Things like Ceaser cipher is usually called just that, ciphers. It's mostly a matter if they're designed to be complex and used with a key or not. But it can still be used to describe advanced algorithms.

BTW, for my scheme the poll workers couls sign the encrypted votes as a means to let you prove later that your encrypted vote wasn't submitted to the count by the SMPC, if it is missing from the (still encrypted) vote list. It could prevent voting fraud based on statistics (such as dropping many votes at random in districts where political opponents have stronger support). The poll workers could even have their keys signed by a previous run of the SMPC, so the voter can really confirm they are official poll workers when submitting the vote.
In my scheme, you can't make multiple votes because the SMPC checks that each public key (and each person has exactly one voting keypair) only gets one vote.

I understand *supply* and demand, and I actually know what most people here are looking for and how the protocol works. But you don't seem to actually understand the dynamics. 
Your theory was only true in the first 2-3 years of Bitcoin, but not today. **There are more coins on the exchanges at each point in time than the miners mint in a few months.**
The miners are simply a minority among the users today, and also stand for a minority of the coins on the exchanges. 
There are not enough of them to sustain the price of everybody else sells of, and most of them can't lower it significantly by selling everything of at once (they don't all have thousands of coins). If miners stops selling their coins, the market will go on as if nothing happened for quite a while.

Lightweight clients like Electrum "offloads" the blockchain storage to servers. It can sync in less than a minute that way since there's much less data it needs to download.
If you want to give Bitcoin to somebody who never had any before, I'd go with giving them a paper wallet (you should offer to keep a backup in case they lose it), and offer them to help them install a client and import the wallet there once they want to use it.
They should not keep bitcoins on a computer until they know how to keep it secure. Once you help them import the coins to a client in order to use it, make a malware scan on the computer. And help them export the remaining coins to a paper wallet again.

It's still possible to create a backdoor free version if that would be the case.
The concept is out there already now: A transaction type that "locks up" coins in a specific way, including an encrypted "serial number" in it (secret). A "one-way accumulator" (that can be compared to a checksum) that so to say keeps a reference to all those coins spent that way (updated in every block by the miners). A transaction with a "zero-knowledge proof" that uses that "one-way accumulator" to prove the knowledge of one of these "serial numbers" and thus unlocks the same amount of coins, selecting some of the (unspent) ones at random, and sends it to an address generated using that "serial number" (so each "serial number" only can be used once).
Knowledge can not be revoked.

Let's say you need a 128 bit tag for it to be secure, giving a strength of 1/2^120 forgery success rate per attempt. Each hash has to be somewhat longer than the tag, but I can't find any details for the exact length, but let's assume 140 bits or so (some part of the hash is removed before you use it as a tag).
Then part of the key for each round must be 128 bits to select from one of 2^128 hashes (as many hash functions as possible tags). And then for a 1 megabyte message you get 8 388 608 = 140*2^x where x is the number of rounds, so the number of rounds is log2(8388608/140) ~= 16.
So you 128*16 bits + 128 bits for the one time pad for the tag, so that's just above 2 kilobits (over 8x those 256 bits). Then that 1 megabyte message can get you 8388608/128 = 65536 one time pads for that many authenticated 1 megabyte messages.
Well, then the overhead isn't all that extreme, but defining that hash family such that it's actually secure can still be an issue (although there's already a few to chose from). And for those 16 rounds of hashes you need to compute a total of (8388608/140)*2-1 = about 119 837 hashes (even if they're simple).

What would show up that could be faster, that can't be applied to FPGAs? Even significantly faster memory buses can often simply be hooked up to an FPGA's pins using some relatively cheap custom circuits (map one fast pin to many slower ones on the FPGA). And yes, large FPGAs have *a lot* of free pins in most cases to support this.
Also, as long as there's any kind of reasonable profit in running the most efficient miner on the network, you *will* eventually make a profit on the expensive hardware too.

1: The financial risk in setting up GPU mining rigs with hardware that can and often has burned out when the value of the coins can crash to zero is pretty big.
2: At some point it will be too costly to outpower every miner in the whole world. Bitcoin mining already exceeds the total power of several hundreds of the worlds fastest supercomputers.
The "target" in bitcoin mining ALSO keeps changing. It's not about secrets, it's about patterns.
The blockchain is just that - a chain of blocks. Every bitcoin node knows the "genesis block", the very first block. Blockchain selection is based on which chain has the most computing power behind it. To create a fake blockchain that nodes will accept you need to spend as much computing power as the ENTIRE BITCOIN MINING NETWORK has spent SINCE THE BEGINNING UP UNTIL RIGHT NOW in a far shorter time (weeks at best).
Bitcoin is decentralized, it doesn't have any central servers. You need to wipe the blockchain from ALL storage devices in the entire world to have a chance of replacing it with your own.

Bitmessage is based on a version of the blockchain design. So you basically just recieve the blockchain and send what you recieved when requested. Check what the client receives, compare with what it sends. Timing + file size and more.
I2P splits everything up in pieces and shuffles around what you send among with everything you route, and uses layered encryption. You can't tell which packet you're sending that came from where.
In practice, Bitmessage as implemented is pretty flawed. It's a nice idea though.

It is all about entropy. In the realms of cracking, more entropy is like a bigger and more massive fortress. Breaking through over 100 bits of entropy will not happen for decades to come. 
Those words from Electrum represents 128 bits. 
With Diceware and 8-9 words you get over 100 bits of entropy as well. Go for 14 words of you want to max out the 160 bits of entropy that Bitcoin addresses can represent (more words after that don't add to your security). 
80 bits of entropy is what is within reach of massive server farms today. 
Every added bit DOUBLES the workload.

Yup, I assume it would check for obvious pattern such as which words are included that way. And it probably didn't know which exact wordlist being used, maybe assuming you used a larger wordlist than you did. It might also attribute some entropy bits to the probability of that form of password being used (list of words as compared to random characters; including if spaces are used or not). But if an attacker know what pattern you follow, it would be a bad idea to assume that the pattern selection itself adds any entropy bits.

In Android (yes, I know it's not a PC OS) and on some seriously hardened Linux versions (not default). Not that it's relevant, that wasn't my point at all. The whole point is that the signatures on executables in Windows only is meaningful to sysadmins, not end users.
Also, for individual developers it's both cheaper and easier to use GPG/PGP than to get a certificate for your excutables. It is also easier to confirm others got the same public key for the same developer.


I was talking about the CA that issues the certificate.


One CA can issue certs for anything and everything. Single developers can sign the hashes of their own software, and will not impact anybody not using the software if their keys are compromised. And warnings of malware being signed works about the same in both cases.

Except he needs to get the notary to sign the new transaction too. The notary won't, that's the purpuse, and I already explained why a notary doing otherwise would fail instantly.
Thus the new doublespend transaction just won't be valid yet, so the first transaction will be several blocks back in the chain once the notary signature requirements is lifted. Thus once he finally can publish the new transaction, it will be rejected as a doublespend.
As I said, if merchants only accepts transactions signed by a trusted notary with +1h left on the notary signature requirement window, they are safe. By the time the buyer can issue his non-notarized transaction the old one will have been confirmed in the blockchain.

If you generate 8 words, that is 103 bits of entropy, more than strong enough for decades. Or you can generate 10 words for 129 bits, which will last for centuries or more (assuming no quantum computers shows up).
In the worst case with serious crypto advancements and quantum computers, entropy will still stand strong, and Grover's algorithm for quantum computers can only effectively halve it. So if you go for 30 words (+387 bits) and make sure you memorize it, then it's practically uncrackable.

You can't have a purely digital decentralized token where 1 credit = 1 work hour. How do you even make sure 1 work hour = 1 work hour, or in other words that people will consider all types of work equal? That's already a problem with LETS, Wikipedia cites that only 13% of the LETS systems apply "equality".


I know the flaws very well, and I also know that some of the things that are claimed to be flaws *aren't*.
You simply can not have ALL the features you are asking for at once. They are incompatible. Anonymity alone makes it practically impossible to ensure that somebody don't try to fake having done tons of work (or just doing trivial work) to then try to use those credits to claim high value work.

Geographic and cultural/social reasons is the reason for all these national currencies. Except for when people traded raw materials like gold and silver as currency, there has been few cases where any given area has had multiple competing currencies. I don't really count local + roman currency during the Roman's peak, since that's more like local currency + USD today, and locally it's still the local currency that dominates, and what competes with the USD? Not the Euro, just look at oil trading where USD dominates.

That shouldn't have been a video. It's just a text slideshow with some random elevator music.
1: Scalability. Where those limits mainly are set by some constants in teh code that ca  be changed, and where Bitcoin has far greater research put into solving it for full global usage than any of the altcoins does.
2: Mining does NOT have to perpetually increase. It just have to stay at a level where no single entity can do a 51% attack. If the hardware is getting cheaper for the attacker, why would it not be getting cheaper for the rest of the miners too? All the miners could simply eventually have a fixed budget per year for new mining hardware that would exceed the hardware budget of any attacker.
3: How can Peercoin *never* have a transaction volume problem? What kind of research is it's developers doing on network scalabiltiy problems?
4: "Fixed transaction fees are destroyed; preventing inflation". That doesn't even make sense. Not destroying them wouldn't cause inflation either. And destroying them only prevents inflation if at least as much coins are destroyed in transaction fees as there are mined coins. 1% continous increase in coins for everyone also isn't really a meaningful "advantage". Isn't that exactly what inflation is? Everybody still have the same *ratio* of coins. And by the way, with a fixed transaction fee and 1% inflation in number of coins, you just enforced a maximum growth rate of your market. It can never catch up with Bitcoin.
5: How can a fixed transaction fee be a good idea? What if the coin value would go up so that 0.01 PPC = 10 USD? If the transaction limit is artificially set through a fixed transaction fee relative to the total amount of coins, then the market for it can NEVER EVER rise beyond a point where that transaction fee is no longer financially viable. Or in other words, a market dominated by average users will never let the price go up so much that 0.01 PPC is greater than the average transaction fee for ordinary credit card payments (or else they'd just ditch it entirely to save money), so the total market value of all coins can never be greater than the average credit card transaction fee multiplied by the total amount of 0.01 PPC. Also, since it doesn't actually have a market cap, then 0.01 can actually one day (when there's a ton of PPC) be lower than the Bitcoin mining fee. And then what? You just lost that so called "long term advantage" in limiting transactions (which wasn't even a good idea in the first place).
6: Off-chain transactions, anyone? No, it won't stop high-frequency trading. 
7: What's the state of reasearch behind Proof-of-stake mining? How does it prevent things like 51% attacks? And why would it NOT just shift the market to the benefit of large players since they have lower overhead? It just encourages hoarding worse than Bitcoin does. 
Edit: 8: And a 51% attack against it is practically automatically perpetual. Once somebody starts a 51% attack value will start to drop, allowing them to further increase their grip on the system by cheaply buying all the coins sold in panic. There is no way you can fight back by introducing more of your own resources, unlike for Bitcoin where miners could plug in ALL of their old mining hardware that ended up being unprofitable just to regain a majority of honest hashing power as well as adding new computing power to counter it. And it's always just temporary for as long as the miners is capable of matching the attacker's mining power.
@_date: 2013-06-05 22:14:55
The difficulty together with the hashing power decides (through statistics/probabilities) how often blocks are mined.
The goal is to have one mined every 10 minutes.
Difficulty adapts every 2016 blocks to attempt to keep it at once every 10 minutes.
When hashing power goes up fast before difficult adjusts, blocks are mined more often on average.

The Bitcoin protocol manages the coins in the form of transaction inputs and outputs. Think of it as taking a block of gold and splitting it up between the recipients, and then that recipient uses his pieces to spend by melting them together and splitting it up in new pieces for the recipients of his payments.

The online computer knows how many coins the addresses it knows of holds. Note that all coins are simply entries in the blockchain, assigned to an address. 
The offline computer uses the seed values to regenerate all the same keys and addresses. 
It just needs to sign those transactions the online computer has created. It doesn't care if they are valid or not (trying to spend money you don't have or not) as the network will take care of verifying that anyway.

Regarding my scheme above, I think the blockchain is the perfect place to put the announcements (or rather hashes of the announcements) such that people can be certain they're seeing the correct public keys, that they're seeing the correct result, etc... Using the blockchain to do the actual voting isn't really useful, IMHO. 
I think I revised that post 20 times or so after posting it. There wasn't any major arhitectural changes, but rather things I realized could be improved. The nonce based verification, for example, is one of the later additions.
You're from Scotland? I'm a Swede, here's greetings from east. I've got +120 on your posts, by the way, and definitely recognize your username. :)
What's your background in this field, regarding both the tech part and the trust part? My own thinking is mostly that I really want to get rid of all possible single points of failure, I'm looking at this more from an engineering point of view. But game theory is also interesting to me, and I guess you can tell that based on how I discuss the incentives of the participants in that scheme. If you can work around having to put trust in something, I'd say do it. I'm also interested in security and have followed Bruce Schneier's blog, and when thinking about security protocols I find it interesting to try to think like an attacker would and figure out what could be exploited and how to prevent it.
Reading your post now, and having read up a bit more recently on zero-knowledge proofs, including the zerocoin authors' "decentralized anonymous credentials" paper, I think that the actual list of votes could be either epublished directly somehow and anonymized, or not published but with a zero-knowledge proof posted of what was in the input and of how they were counted.
On making it more transparent, I'm not sure if that can really be done. How do you avoid things like timing attacks and more? If you skip old flawed voting mechanisms and allow for more granularity, how do you avoid matching votes to voters using profiling (matching opinions to what people have posted on Facebook, etc) to further reduce the anonymous pool of votes, etc? Even if you used something zerocoin style to do it, there's plenty of flaws, IMHO, such as timing and profiling. Keeping it secure and anonymous isn't easy.
Potentially homomorphic encryption + zero-knowledge proofs could be used, but I don't really know how such a system would work. Above all I don't know how to perform the vote counting with it or how to avoid timing attacks or profiling. Maybe so called "privacy preserving data mining" could be applied somehow to avoid the profiling part.

What is so hard to change about Bitcoin? And what can we change about HTTP so easily? There's a reason they have started developing HTTP 2.0 now, we need a replacement soon because of how different the web is used nowaways (multithreaded downloads, compression, security, etc). But HTTP 1.0 also gained the popularity it got when it was new for the same reasons Bitcoin has - it was the best compromise available when it was released, and it stayed that way for years!
Just like Google's SPDY protocol haven't been able to make any sizable impact on HTTP's share, Bitcoin competitors will have major problems in taking any large parts of it's shares. And just like how HTTP 2.0 are taking in features from SPDY, Bitcoin will be able to take in features from other competitors. It's a matter of consencus among the Bitcoin developers and if the Bitcoin community agree with the changes, and if so then it will be able to adapt.
It will be *incredibly* hard for competitors to Bitcoin to take over.

All I have is this, really: 
I know that calculating the metrics is hard, and that evaluating trust is hard. But I want to try it.
Above all, it won't consider trust too far away in the network. It will also rapidly trust each step less, and a spammer will likely be many steps away and thus never get priority. It will also don't trust "closed" networks much (a pool of connected users that only have a few connections towards you).
In short, WoT-DNS would be centered on *you* and *your* trust, and not on the global network.

Only one branch can become the "canon" fork in such cases (due to reasons explained below). Since most people NOT will switch instantly all over the globe, the fork (the new branch) will become worthless since most people will stay on the original blockchain (the original branch).
Creating a hardfork where you leave millions of coins under control by people outside your target group (in the case of USA, the US people) will put your fork at the risk of massive manipulation. People outside won't trade in it, but those who owned a lot before the hardfork can show up later and dump coins on the fork's market and crash the price once (if ever!) the trade goes up, making the price go up (supply and demand an all that).
It's just an incredibly dumb idea to hardfork.

Only the comment on what type of cryptography in use was wrong, but not entirely. Bitcoin uses ECDSA and SHA256 + RIPEMD160 but no encryption, so there's no primes or actual encryption there at all. But Zerocoin would bring back RSA which uses primes, would be fully anonymous instead of pseudonymous, and while it also doesn't use encryption it *does* use cryptographic obfuscation (zero-knowledge proofs).
The main concept of how it would work practically was however correct.

A large part is because of speculation, but the idea behind it really can support a much higher price. There's payments between different daughter companies owned by the same company that is larger than Bitcoins entire current market cap. Those payments would be faster and easier with Bitcoin. So the price can clearly keep rising for quite a while, and stay high. But the price can still also fall repeatedly as speculators cash out, but those who are in it for what Bitcoin can do will stay.

I know the difference. There's no central node with more authority than any other in Bitcoin, thus decentralized.

Beamforming for wifi is finally becoming common (using multiple antennas for directed constructive/destructive interference so that the signal becomes stronger in the chosen direction and weaker in others), and meshnets can certainly use this.

Because more forks = more waste. There's no easy method of getting any reasonable security for payments in any less than at least half a minute from being issued even with one second confirmations. And what people really are looking for is secure 2-second payments. You can't have that with ONLY decentralized systems. Notaries fortunately doesn't require a significant amount of additional trust, however. 
My suggested system however requires absolutely no change in Bitcoin, it's just a P2SH address with a 2-of-2 signature requirement where the other part is a notary. 
And when Bitcoin grows, then what? A proof-of-stake system is however practically unrecoverable in that case, you can't outspend an attacker that holds 51% of the coins. It's dead, Jim. Then there's also the thing that proof-of-stake REQUIRES people to put their private keys in plaintext on network connected computers. Now how about NSA using zeroday exploits against the largest holders? That's certainly not nearly as expensive as buying ASICs. Do you think the largest holders will want to expose their private keys to network connected devices? 
@_date: 2013-08-21 21:16:48
For public keys: NTRU or McEliece. For symmetric encryption, AES256. For checksums, SHA256 (which Bitcoin already uses) or better, like SHA3's Keccak.

I think a lot of people here feel like they were one of the people to get off the very first boat to America. And they saw a truly massive potential. And almost nobody else in the entire world would believe it could really be that good until decades later. 
Large masses of people won't even be willing to touch Bitcoin until it has proven it is as amazing as it seems, which won't happen until multiple large international companies start accepting it and people see amazing services that only can exist thanks to the features of Bitcoin. 
And by that time Bitcoin will ALREADY be worth a few hundred times more than it is today AT LEAST. And the growth after our had proven to the masses that it is here to stay forever, that's just going to be insane. It will be the goldrush 2.0, but global and open to everybody! 
The question really is how long time that will take. What would stop it? Will inertia hold off that development off for another century? Will technical issues with scaling kill off interest and leading people to believe it can't work even if those issues were to be solved? Will we face global disaster like massive solar storms knocking out large portions of our global networks, handicapping Bitcoin? Will scans and PR campaigns trash it's reputation?

How do you expect to get a 511 bit *quantum computer* to deal with that complexity efficiently?
Also, it's absurdly inefficient on regular computers compared to regular mining. The complexity won't make this process fast on quantum computers. You'll need tons of rounds to get it to work.
Quantum computers are not magic. They don't solve anything in a single round. They are even slower than regular computers on tons of simple problems. They just happen to be able to solve certain things on average in fewer rounds of computation than regular computers. And the more complexity, the lower the chance for a correct output in each round = slower.
Edit: For clarification - it is in no way at all impressive that a regular computer can solve the exact same problem it previously have solved fast in a different, slower and more convoluted way.
And it's ability to do so has no connection whatsoever to what a quantum computer will or won't be able to do.

Because the supply includes coins that already had been mined and sold. They are not the sellers behind most coins in the market. They do not control the price of the majority of the coins on the exchanges. They can't set the price for others, only for themselves. If nobody buys their coins because they're too expensive, they do not affect the price. 
The rate of mined coins is relatively stable, and most coins are sold quickly at market price by the miners.

But my point is that your server-side validation doesn't matter, it's useless. Your site doesn't even use SSL, I can MITM the site on an open WLAN and put my own address there. Also, all I have to do otherwise is to make sure that the target doesn't get the right link, I can always replace the link before he gets it. Your validation doesn't matter if he never reaches your site or if he ends up on the wrong page on your site.
Doing a MITM on WLAN is TRIVIAL with many open source tools. It isn't even hard with many tools to replaces arbitary data, just paste the address to replace and your own address that it is supposed to be replaced with. Done!

Well, it COULD be a mess if all the ASICs have to be scrapped instantly.
Hopefully most of them will be flexible enough that they can verify the previous block even if it uses another checksum. Ideally we'd have a period of multiple hash algorithms until we need to drop one of them, so people can phase out old SHA256 ASICs without an instant drop in hashing power in the network.
FYI: SHA256 is part of the SHA2 standard. The NIST competition for SHA3 was recently finished with Keccak as the winner, which could replace SHA256.

It's possible to defend against TEMPEST attacks (power usage analysis and more), but of course it's hard. The best attacks typically take hours, so if you use it together with a server and require multisignature transactions, and have the key material encrypted with the PIN, then you can often report the card stolen in time to protect yourself.
I would like to point out again that most biometrics is insecure. It's too easy to fool most scanners, and you can't revoke your biometric data if it ever would be successfully replicated.
I will look into finger vain recognition, but I doubt it can't be fooled. Once you have access to a high-quality scan (MITM'd the scanner? It's not actually always that hard to do) it's not too hard to replicate most of these things. There's plenty of materials that can mimic a hand.11

Why not? If you're sure you'll earn more on spending $100 on Bitcoin than spending $100 on upgrading car parts to make it more efficient (to save money), then why not?
That's how companies handle their economics. They look at every option for spending their money and goes for the options that has the highest returns. It doesn't matter if they have massive loans or not. They'll be paying for their electricity and other costs of running their operation *and* make investments.
What says individuals can't do the same? If they're sure it will pay off more than just paying back the loan with that money, why not? Spending $100 on Bitcoins under the assumption it will make you money is not very different from spending money on solar panels under the assumption it will save you money (maybe you assume electricity costs will go up so you save on the bills).
Why can't you make investments when you have loans if you're an individual?
And BTW, Bitcoin can be converted back to USD pretty fast anyway.

Somebody suggested using web of trust, but that can be gamed as well (collusion by majority, threats, and more). There's no decentralized way to do it. And centralized ways obviously won't work in the long term.

Transactions are unverified until included in the blockchain.
Conflicting transactions can't be in the blockchain.
Nodes that already have seen one transaction issued that isn't yet in the blockchain and then receives another that conflicts with it will NOT forward the latter one, it will be rejected instead. The miners do the same. So even if the two are sent at the same time, they will not both reach all nodes, and certainly not all miners either. So it might be random which one is included.
That is why you are supposed to wait for confirmations when you sell something of value, so the transaction can either end up in the blockchain (verified through mining) or rejected (at which point it would be a good idea to cancel your sale).

Processing the blocks becomes slower for recent blocks due to larger and more complex transactions. The new signature verification library will be faster.
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:28:15
It just doesn't solve anything. It forces too much complexity. 
You still can't verify a block without having a full index and doing tons of extra calculations. For every address, you need to make sure all account balances are updates atomically (simultaneously subtract and add sums from the server and to the receiver) one by one internally when computing final balances. You end up with a table of addresses involved in the block and serial (no parallel processing! No multicore or cluster performance advantages!) processing of all the transactions to update the table. You look up all balances to start off, then calculate changes. Any impossible change must not be immediately discarded, but instead put on hold. 
Any complex does series of transactions with multiple addresses becomes a puzzle with only a single solution which needs to be calculated. This is no trivial task! This isn't far off in complexity from the knapsack problem. 
And transactions still need unique identifiers to make sure they can't be repeated to drain accounts.
Today you could settle with storing the UTXO set on fast memory, leaving all the rest on a slow secondary system. Check every transaction against the UTXO set, make sure each one is claimed no more than once.

Let's think of it in entropy - if you know it's A or B, that's 2 options and this 1 bit of variation possible. So 2^1. 26 fully random alphanumeric characters is nearly 156 bits. But if you remember 20 of them, you only need to crack 35 bits worth of those 156 bits. And that assumes you have *no clue* what those characters are. If you have some clue, you might only need to crack something like a few bits worth per character, which multiplied together is less than a few billion.
If you can reduce the number of possible variations to something in a few billion (something closer to 30 bits or less, 2^30 = 1 073 741 824), that's reasonably bruteforcable on your own computer.
If there's an entire random string you've forgotten longer than ~10 characters, and you don't remember the rest precisely, it's lost.

Zero-knowledge proofs? Maybe even using this that recently was published by the Zerocoin authors;
So you could trust a number of chosen of well known escrows, and people could use zero-knowledge proofs for that they have made at least a certain number of successful transactions with those escrows. And those escrows would have to try to detect "sock puppets" and stuff like that to make it harder to fake reputations, and you'd chose to trust the escrows that has done a good job.

There's zero-knowledge proofs that can be used to anonymously prove citizenship, and it could potentially also be used in a way to do that while preventing people from trying to pose as two different people (no double registrations). If the goverment would issue ID cards with smartcards that hold asymmetric keypairs that would be signed in a verifiable format, that would let people anonymously "register" their keys/addresses for this. Check Zerocoin as an example for how the crypto works.

80 bits is assumed to be crackable, and 100+ (typically 128 bits) is considered fine, and 256 is generally prefered by security geeks.
Diceware with 8 random words from a list of 6^5 = 7776 words (5 dice) has an entropy of log2( ( 6^5 )^8 ) = 7776^8 = 103 bits, and 9 words then gives 116 bits, 14 words = 181 bits, 17 words = 220 bits and 20 words = 258 bits.
For most people 8-9 words is fine, but if you want to store larger sums and feel paranoid then you should go for 14-15 words or even 20 words.
Note that in Bitcoin, the addresses are limited to 160 bits anyway due to the use of RIPEMD160, so 13 words = 168 bits is technically the limit for when the attacker would be able to find collisions anyway even if they wouldn't find your original password. But let's assume that your dice is somewhat biased and a little predictable, so go for about 14-15 words anyway if you feel paranoid.

Then the pool would have to pay proportionally to submitted shares, but yes, the honest miners would likely see lower payouts as they have to share them with the attacker while the attacker don't actually contribute. 
The attacker would earn less than optimally, but a motivated attacker might find it worth it if he can drive people out of the pool due to the low payouts until it shuts down. 
The worst part is that it's statistically hard to tell if an attacker is malicious if he has many accounts due to the low probability for each miner to successfully find a block. You can't clearly see that he behaves maliciously.

Bitcoin uses ECDSA public key crypto to avoid messages being modified. Secrecy isn't a problem. That leaves confirming the other end has your transaction, which you can be certain of if you can see it being several blocks back in the chain as there is a close to zero risk of them ending up on a valid blockchain fork that don't have your transaction. It is safe to assume everybody will see and agree on the very same blockchain globally, due to chain selection based on the amount of computational work behind it.

Well, not really. Forwards compatible means that the old clients already are aware that new address formats can show up. Those clients just can't interact with the new addresses. You have to upgrade the client to deal with them. It's just the cryptographic algorithms that would change, not how the transactions work.
Though an old client would not be able to verify a payment to it if the coins sent ever has been sent to and passed on from a client using the new format.

That kind of "concensus" would be incredibly hard to fake. To alter Bitcoin history you need far more than 51% of the computing power to not only successfully mine blocks based on a very old block of your choice, but to also build an entire chain long enough and with a high enough total difficulty to catch up with the current blockchain in a reasonable amount of time. The longer back you go to rewrite Bitcoin history, the longer time it takes to catch up again. And then it isn't sure you STILL have over 51%, and then the total difficulty of your mined blocks might not be higher = total failure.

Also, you can't reliably build in inflation. You just can't know at what rate the real inflation will grow, and you can't predict it, and any algorithm that tries to match it dynamically will be gamed.

Quantum computers work using probabilities. They are the best at optimization problems (which route is the fastest between A and B in a city with a messy network of roads?) and things like factorization (which numbers A and B multiplied together gives me this number X?). They don't really handle stuff like complex algorithms well, you can't really compute something like let's say standard computations very much faster. Testing a lot of options at once is what they excel at, not computing one algorithm from beginning to end. Maybe it could do bitcoin mining, but I doubt you can make it excel at "which X will give a hash with a very low value when you take SHA256([multiple kB of data]+X?)".

Depends on how much your goods are worth. The idea is to make a doublespend attempt unprofitable. Below $50, zero confirmations and simply looking for the transaction to show in the wallet client is typically fine. $50-$1000 I'd say 1 confirmation (being included in a block), then 2 transactions for above that. 6+ is considered almost impossible to pull off a doublespend attack against without spending massive resources. Sums at multiple millions of dollars and up would typically be safe after ~20 confirmations. Yes, it really gets exponentially harder that fast (yay math!).

@_date: 2013-06-03 14:35:12
For those who wonders, there's 4 bytes taken from a SHA256 checksum of the actual address embedded in the standard address format. That means there's 256^4 = 2^32 = 4 294 967 296 possible combinations, and only one that is valid for each address.
If you mistype any single character, it will simply just fail (most likely, due to base58 there's one of them that MAYBE could be changed such that it won't fail since it both changes the last bits of the address and the first of the checksum).
If you mistype both the first and the last characters, there's a 1 in 4 billion risk of getting it wrong and it being accepted. Actually, theres likely even less than that because you're not likely to get ALL the characters randomly wrong in any part of the string.

You can try calculating for yourself how easy it is to accidentally generate a string from a RNG with 120 1's and 80 0's. You have to *make an effort* to find a string with that bias from a cryptographically strong RNG. A bad RNG could generate that *every time*. Guess what I'd assume based on seeing a string like that.


Except that it will almost certainly be easy to find traces of his method.


Or that he runs an automated file recovery program and a script to search through what it finds. It's really not that hard.


But there's the biggest problem, he really don't sound like he understand security well enough for this. If he would know security well, he'd try to remember a good passphrase instead of remembering some random method of getting some string and doing stuff with it to get the key.

So the probability to solve it in the full 10 minutes is 100%?
Assuming a hashrate of 10 000 in my altcoin I mine on a Commodore 64, and the difficulty has been adjusted to that. So we want 1 hash in 10 000 to create a block to hit that average time of a block per 10 minutes. 
After 1 minute and 1000 hashes, the probability to find a block is 1 - ( (1-0.0001)^1000 ) = 0.095167... = 9.5%. Because statistics. Try a few different numbers in there in a spreadsheet to see for yourself.

How can they get the proper capitalization of Bitcoin wrong so systematically?
And I don't like the assumptions they make about verifiability of intrusions, being able to detect replaced data on the local computers, and that they don't even seem to consider voter anonymity.


on the bitVote system, then their ID will not be in doubt.
The vulnerability here would include cases where Social Security numbers had been
stolen or identity theives have stolen the numbers. In that case, then a compromised
voter would then have additional unauthorized logins to his account. A solution to this
problem could be to send a phone call or text msg or email to the voter every time their
voter account has a login event. If this is the voter doing this directly, they can easily
ignore the call, txt or email. If the voter was not in the act of logging in themselves,
then these calls, txts and emails would be welcome warnings indeed and suitable Review
Actions could be activated.
This is horrifyingly bad. Things like that are faaaar to easy to circumvent.

It doesn't actually help if it's still insecure and he dismisses the feedback after hearing it. It's not enough to just listen. You have to fix the issues too. 
They aren't fixed. 
Fairly secure? It's still not comparable to the very well established protocols like OTR. Even if the author somehow managed to make it decent by accident, it can become crap again (see the previous Decryptocat link again, he switched from a crappy cipher to a good one to a crappy one to a worse one). 
And you are still missing the point. The amount of feedback is more than just one or two pieces. Fixing a few things that was pointed out isn't the same as actually being genuinely open to feedback. There is plenty of things that still aren't fixed. It's just not anything like a proper security protocol design.

This is a matter of trust and usability. Do they trust another nation they probably barely know to keep the trend up? Bitcoin is at least (or will be) driven by more global trends that are easier to track. And how quickly can you trade JPY and get it sent wherever you want? Sure, there are plenty of currency exchanges, but are they as fast as for selling of Bitcoin (do you even have a special bank account to hold JPY, or would you hold it in cash)? And it's easier to use BTC in USA than it is to use JPY.

No, but you can have a wallet setup with Armory or Electrum where you have an offline computer with a wallet client and the private keys, and an online computer that just know your addresses.

1: No, because people will lose trust in Bitcoin if that happens.
2: No, because P2Pool (distributed/decentralized = no single entity that controls the pool).
3: No, because it takes too long for the real-life market to adjust to what's happening online. Just 1 hour of one pool having 51% could be devastating. Real-life markets don't move fast enough to account for that.

Yeah, it basically takes the transactions one at a time and check them against the blockchain if they are valid, and change the count accordingly. For a double-spend where the balance ends up negative, the latter transaction are considered invalid. If one transaction are included in the blockchain first, that's conclusive and means the latter *will* be discarded.
There will be no disagreement. The transaction is valid or not. A new block with valid transactions is accepted. A block with invalid transactions is not accepted. Which transaction ends up in the blockchain doesn't matter if it's valid.
So basically, each transaction alone in a double-spend is valid, but only one can be accepted since the balance otherwise would go negative.

Yes, but I think it could be done torrent style so people don't have to hold the entire blockchain. Though you'd still have to fetch all parts of it and verify it at some point (at setup), but it would be "streaming like" - you fetch the first blocks and verify them, and keeps going, and drops the old blocks when you've verified them. Everybody keeps some of the blocks at random. When you need a block, you ask for it by asking about it's hash (does transaction inputs also point to the block they were included in? I need to check). You'd always keep the blocks relevant for your own keys/addresses. When you recieve transactions, you verify it by asking about the blocks it's inputs comes from.

The value lies in what can be done with it, the price is an estimation of the value relative to other things. There's less value in a small Bitcoin market. You can't do as much with it if only a few online stores accept it. If many accept it, then it's more valuable as more can be done with it.


If everything on the market grows equally, the value is about the same. If there's more buyers, more sellers and more money in equal proportions, the money is still as valuable for each individual as before. Growth can be fast or slow, stable (staying within a certain range or otherwise not changing too fast) mostly somewhat predictable or change rapidly. If the previous mentioned proportions stay the same, even during rapid and unpredictable changes, the value is stable, because at each point in time each person can do all the same things as before with his money.
Bitcoin is very much not like that. One of the variables is already fixed. We can only have stability if there's a controlled inflow or outflow of money and participants.


That's just a trolling strawman. I have not ever said anything like that. Not even once. A certain number is stable if it's changing slowly OR is constant. That number can't be stable if it's changing fast, but it's acceleration (number of units it changed per units of time) can be stable.
Or are you using a definition of stable in economics that is COMPLETELY disconnected from the meaning in everyday usage and within the field of engineering?
How likely is it that the value of Bitcoin will stay stable with uncontrollable and unpredictable inflows and outflows of buyers, sellers and merchants, with all their money moving unpredictably? Services and exchanges shows up and disappears overnight, literally, and while there's still only a few of each, all these events have a major impact. Until it's more or less established, and that will take considerable growth from the point it's at now, the chances of stability will be so low that it likely wont have a stable value. Once it's established, the value will be stable. Because then you'll know that you can do approximately the same things and just as much with your bitcoins today as in a year.
In other words: People won't value bitcoins the same over a long period of time unless all the major factors that determine what you can do with it stays mostly the same over a long period of time. And obviously exchange price is one of the factors, and the size of the market (larger size means there's likely a larger amount of varying types of buyers and sellers), etc... Since all these major variables will keep changing for a long time, it won't have a stable value for a long time. 
If you don't like my terminology, then just say so. But assuming that I don't understand anything because my terminology isn't *identical* to yours is stupid. Same thing in technology (where I have some experience in being the tech support guy for half the people around me) - sometimes people use the wrong words, and the words they use would have meant something completely different and possibly selfcontradictory, but since I'm a human I can actually understand the context and understand *what the person meant*, and figure out what word he *should* have used. Sometimes it makes no sense at all, sometimes it makes total sense but there's just bad terminology.
Only computers and elitists rejects sane logic simply because it's expressed wrong.
The rest of us simply tells the person in question the correct way of expressing it, and corrects any wrong details. 
Unless my reasoning as such is clearly wrong, and not just my expression of it, then you are simply just stupid if you dismiss it as being completely wrong. Or maybe you're Sheldon Cooper, with an even more impaired ability to understand what people *really* mean. If you still think I'm wrong, try explaining what's wrong with my reasoning instead of nitpicking on words. Just simply tell me which words I *should* use, and then EXPLAIN what's wrong.
WHY am I wrong about Bitcoin being unlikely stabilize in value until the market has grown?
You have STILL not even addressed that question.

That is a very bad assumption to make. Recuva and various scripts could very likely find traces of his code. Not to mention that the vast majority of homebrew methods aren't really as unique or hard to guess as people think. Never assume they don't know your method. Lots of entropy is the best protection, always.


My password has more than enough entropy to not be susceptible to brute force. His method is as I said many times before no better than plaintext if the attacker can run arbitary code on the computer (if he can get the wallet file, then he almost certainly run his own arbitary code already) because he can most certainly recover the key generation method.

Even a large finite amount of gates can mimic a 12 core Intel i7. What do you think Intel do their first rounds of chip design testing on? FPGAs.
So if I have enough gates to mimic a full CPU, and even can modify the design to to the computations faster than an average CPU, what are you going to do about it? There's nothing you can do. At best you can design the problem so that it's slow on the average CPU by using as many types of heavy computations at once, but for as long as you're not designing it after *one specific* CPU, a FPGA can likely do it faster than *most* CPUs out there.

No, you just said they are expensive. You didn't tell me what kind of algorithm there is where you can't get enough speedup to make a profit that can pay back the hardware costs (even if it takes a year or so).


It's not just all GPIO on all FPGAs.
By *proof* I expect you to give an example of an algorithm that *requires* an FPGA so large that even when the algorithm is maximally optimized on the FPGA the hardware costs is so extreme that you can't make the money back in &lt;10 years. Feel free to make your own estimations on difficulties and total hashrates and payouts per block for whatever altcoin you'd mine on with it. But try to keep those estimations realistic. Note that you should also take electricity costs for the less efficient miners into consideration (as well as that of the FPGA), which will be prohibitative against trying to throw "too many" regular CPUs at mining it = there's a probable upper limit on total hashrate.
Just claiming "it costs too much" is *not* proof.

You got 10 from Z, 2 from B and 7 from C.
You spend 18 to X. You sum up those 10+7+2 from A, B and C which is 19, and as a result you send 18 to X and 1 to yourself.
It's a simple and easy way to reduce how much computing is required to validate a transaction through specifying which blocks are related. Once the "sources" are known, it's a much simpler task to search for other references to them than to find ALL blocks that the addresses in question are involved with.

No, you're doing it wrong. First of all, WIP format private keys has a checksum in the end, a limited charset and starts with a 5. This leaks a ton of statistical data to the attacker, not to mention that the common ASCII characters are limited to a subset of the possible bytes.
Not to mention that the security depends on the encrypting key being unpredictable! 
And here they have the advantage that they can confirm instantly if they found they private key or not.

Tor's exit nodes behaves like VPNs to some degree. It receives data packets from users, sends them to servers, and pass the response back on to the user. You just connect to the exit nodes in a different way than to regular proxies and VPNs.

Just use any standard linux dist for it (like the standard Debian for the RPi). And use any (secure and trusted!) client you like, such as Armory.
Use a strong password: 


Asymmetric cryptography. You have a public number and a secret private number that has a peculiar matematical relation. The feature used in Bitcoin is it's second most used feature. The most common one is encryption, but in Bitcoin it's digital signatures that we need.
So basically, you write a message that says "I want to transfer X amount of bitcoins from my address to this other address". The addresses are the public keys. And you sign that message by computing a certain new number based on the message and the private key. The cool thing is that anybody that has the public key can verify that the private key was used to generate that number which is the signature, and nobody can fake such a signature without having the private key, and nobody can figure out what the private key *is* just based on having the public key. So if you can securely give your public key to people such that they know it's yours, and if you can protect your private key, then you can keep signing messages and people will know with certainty that it is actually you who signed them.
And in Bitcoins, as mentioned, the signatures is used to authorize transactions.
And only the person who has the private key that goes along with the public key you specified as recipient address can then in turn sign and authorize a new transaction. Nobody else can.
ECDSA is the particular algorithm that Bitcoins use for this.

Basically, the Bitcoin protocol is a system to maintain a globally distributed ledger.
Mining is the process of verifying transactions and of minting new coins through checking the transaction history to see if the issued transactions are are valid and signed correctly, and then the miners creates a block that contains those transactions and a minting transaction to himself.
To create a valid block, the miners run the SHA256 hashing algorithm on the block and checks if the output is below a certain value. If not, it changes a "nonce", a random number in the block, and tries again. Once it has a block with a checksum with an output that has a low enough value, it publishes it, and it is then added to the blockchain (the ledger). The hashing process is called proof-of-work. To keep the block generation times at an average of 10 minutes, the value that has to be met is changed to be harder to meet when new computing power is added to the mining network.

It's practically physically impossible to crack with regular computers.
Although quantum computers can use Shor's algorithm to crack ECDSA (VERY quick factorization), but we have options like McEliece which would be resistant to both types of computers. Use enough bits (most likely we'll never *need* more than 1000 bits ever in our keys) and they'll be safe forever.

Grover's algorithm is the best algorithm known that could work against hashes.
That would reduce RIPEMD160 to 80 bits in strength.
Building a *quantum computing cluster* to bruteforce 80 bits of a hash while ALSO still trying to make sure that the output from that is a public ECDSA key where they have the private key...
Well, the combined computational complexity of the two (generating nearly 2^80 ECDSA keypairs in probably the most complex way ever to be able to benefit from Grover's algorithm) and the size and cost of that quantum computing cluster would make sure that won't happen within a few hundred years.

I understand statistics. I understand randomness. A pool that stands for 60% of the mining power will have a 60% chance per block to mine it.
If P2Pool has 0.3%, it has a 45% chance to get one block of 200 blocks and 80% per 500 blocks.
With P2Pool, if everybody in it together stands for 50% of the computing power, then everybody in it will get payouts much more regularly.
100*(1-(100-0,3)/100)^x, where x is the number of blocks and the output is the chance in percent of successfully mining a block. And 0,3 was the (fictional) example for how much computing power of the total that the pool in question has.
Size has nothing to do with luck, but it has everything to do with probability.

Why remember the mappings when you can have one standard mapping that everybody use?
Why on earth would such a standard table be insecure? If you think that such a table is insecure when both which words is used is a secret and the sequence of them is secret, then you should panic over this:


No, you just take something like 65536 words and let each word represent 16 bits (2^16 = 65536). So for 256 bits, you have 256/16 = 16 words.
16 words from a list of 65536 words is equally secure as 256 bits. Just as long as you can remember them and they're selected randomly there's no problem.
Note that the word list reveals nothing about the actual word selection.

If all your coins are in your Electrum generated addresses (it lists imported addresses separately from those it generated itself), then you only need the Electrum seed backed up. Otherwise you should either back up that file or move all coins right to Electrum's own addresses.
Electrum sends change back to the imported address when they were sent from an imported address. It sends them to once of it's own recieve addresses when you send from Electrum's own addresses. Note that it usually picks the "oldest coins" to spend automatically when you send coins, so it can make it seem random in what addresses it takes coins from. I assume that if it has to take coins both from imported addresses AND it's own addresses to spend, it would send back the change to one of it's own addresses.

Because not every node needs to deal with all of them. There's numerous ways, including more complex Merkle hash sums, to simplify it and append many transactions at once to the blockchain each time.


Too much traffic either way. I think your only chance to get this working is with some weird "one-way accumulator" based algorithm to "sum up" lots of transactions together in order to even make it possible to get the traffic down enough and to make sure everybody has hashes based on all the same transactions. No matter what you think, it's just not reasonable to assume that everybody even in your network will get all transactions in time such that everybody can generate identical hashes.


The basic idea with Bitcoin mining is that miners append transactions to the blockchain through taking announced transactions and working on a proof-of-work system based on those transactions and the previous block. We can reduce the load on the miners if we can simplify those transactions that the miners *actually* have to mine on. By having one Bitcoin transaction actually reference thousands of transactions, you can make it work. How to do that in a secure distributed way isn't really solved yet, but it's almost certainly possible.

The transaction fee is irrelevant. 
Finite supply + demand will lead to no easily accessible supply being left untouched. Nobody will also be willing to aquire some if the share of the supply he is being offered would require more resources of him than he is willing to offer.
You should really think of it as shares of total demand vs shares of total supply. It's finite fractions.

In the end you can not remove all requirements of trust when you are involving human actions. You can not algorithmically verify that another person has done what they say in the past outside the computer (including sending you the items you bought instead of cops).
There's a few models of trust: Centralization (this includes sites that take user feedback since they have ultimate control to reject and include whatever they want), federated systems (where trust extends across organizations, where the different organizations cooperate), and web of trust (each individual user declares who they trust, and trust for people you don't know directly is calculated based on your "trust paths" to them, such as to a friend of a friend).
In the end, when you are going to trust a stranger to send you a physical item you paid for, you either need to trust them blindly *or* trust a person who vouched for them. And if you don't know anybody who vouched for them, you're out of luck. There's always *somebody* you must trust in the first step.

The process is an algorithm. You have an algorithm for hiding a piece of data in other data. That's steganography, a subfield of cryptography. So you have a cryptographic algorithm there, with the full output published. There are plenty of others who have tried that and failed in the past.
You should really not be so sure. It is very likely more predictable than you think. If it can be summed up in less than once sentence, it can most certainly be bruteforced. Even if it takes a paragraph you aren't safe if it's not a novel approach as somebody is likely to have a similiar method on file.
So far I'm assuming from what you said that the data is random, and that you selected some characters in a certain order and replaced those with the key. If the method of selecting the characters is weak, your key can be cracked. 
If you can remember that procedure, why not remember a password? Even if the procedure is hard enough to be safe, it doesn't provide any better security than a password.

Long story short, *utility of physical goods is ephemeral* and should not be trusted.

Even when you cut out the requirement of being safe to handle and easy to verify and divide, due to being stored elsewhere with others dealing with that, you have massive trust issues and have to trust that the issuer of ownership tokens (paper certificates or colored coins) aren't doublespending his assets. Also, ownership aren't totally provable. Your share specifically can perish out of nowhere due to somebody acting maliciously or screwing up.

1: Yes.
2: Kind of yes (RIPEMD160 on SHA256 on the ECDSA public key). You need to reveal the public key when spending your coins, otherwise the transaction signature can't be verified.
3: No, the public key cryptographically signs it. Otherwise you couldn't reasonably verify that the transactions are valid.
4: No encryption. You "assign" the coins to the hash of a public key, the public key is provided when spending the coins to prove you own the coins.
5: Yes, at first sync. Then it only checks the latest blocks each time you open it to look for updates. To spend coins, you need the private key for that specific public key the coins are assigned to.
6: Yes, your wallet client just looks in the blockchain for the coins assigned to the keys it has.
7: Yes, if you encrypt the wallet file then both the file AND the password is needed to get the private keys which are required to spend coins.

A wallet holds a set of addresses. There is one private key for every address and vice versa. Electrum generates all it's addresses from one seed, but knowing one or several of the private keys won't reveal the seed, and thus won't reveal the other private keys. The seed needs to be kept secret! 
Bitcoins sent to an address is linked to that address, and that one alone. It is the private key for that one address you need to spend those coins. 
There is a portable version of Electrum, download that one.

Everything on the host can access the VM if they have the priviligies. If you run a browser and a VM, then a browser exploit that can get a site to execute malware under your user account can lead to your private key being compromized. The malware can probably read the VM's memory where the private key must be at least once.
Edit: Random idea: Could you generate a keypair inside a homomorphically encrypted file? Use a cheap slow device like a Raspberry Pi to homomorphically encrypt a symmetric key with the homomorphic encryption key, use a faster computer to generate the keypair inside that file and encrypt the private key with the symmetric key already in there and then removing the symmetric key in there, THEN move that file back, and decrypt it with the homomorphic encryption key - now you have a public key and a private key already encrypted with the symmetric key. 
Not that it would be much better than directly generating it on the Raspberry Pi in the first place, but it would be much harder to attack. You can even destroy the SD card you used the first time to boot the Pi so that the password to the homomorphically encrypted file can't ever be recovered (you still have to be sure there's no backdoor in the encryption and key generation process, so that the encryption is no weaker than your password).(edited again)

Bitcoin uses ECDSA for (asymmetric!) signing with 256 bits.
The ratio for the number of operations required to bruteforce a key relative to the length of the key in bits higher for AES (symmetric) than for ECDSA (asymmetric) and also higher for ECDSA than for RSA (asymmetric).
The bit-strength depends more on the type of math than on how the algorithm is used.

Sorry, but hashing random numbers with SHA256 is not deterministic (edit: wrote that sentence too fast). Every single generated hash is random and independent of the others. You can absolutely go 24h even with an adjusted difficulty and have no blocks mined.
 1 - ( (1-0.0001)^10000 ) = 0.6321... = 63%.
Yes, it gets closer to 100% with higher hashrates. Doesn't change that it's not 100%.
Funny that you didn't factor in the fact that it previously have taken for example at least 43 minutes between two blocks.
The only 100% thing is that the average will be *very close* to 1 per 10 minutes over a very long period of time. (Assuming a margin of +/- 1% or so on that 100% number.)

It is supposed to work. It's a bit too complex to explain here, but the basics in how you use it is that you "deposit" BTC to Zerocoins, and then you can "withdraw them" to BTC using what is called a zero-knowledge proof. Nobody can tie the deposit to the withdrawal.
It requires an addition to the Bitcoin protocol, but no significant modifications. Bitcoin already supports custom messages and data.

Basically yes. You create a Zerocoin with a custom transaction in which there is a "serial number", which is registered in the accumulator. Then when you spend you prove with Zero-knowledge proofs that you know that number and that it has not been spent previously, and claim zerocoins from that Zerocoin pool that is then sent to another address of yours as regular Bitcoins.

Kind of. There's a size limit. There's ways around that, though.


AFAIK no, if what you are talking about is doublespending, using the same bitcoins twice. That won't be accepted. But you can obviously make multiple identical transactions if you've got enough bitcoins for it.

You should be a ware that the nonce only is 4 bytes/32 bits, so that's only 4 billion possible values. Testing other values for time (there's limits on that) and reordering transactions and calculating Merkle tree hashes of them is two other VERY important part of mining.
And Merkle tree hash recalculation after reordering transactions is one of the heavier computations.
Not to mention that computing a Merkle hash tree AND doing two rounds of SHA256 and searching for a low enough SHA256 output with corresponding input would be incredibly complex and require at least millions of qubits.
And quantum computers works on probabilities, and chances are it wouldn't actually be able to run the rounds fast enough to find a single valid block in time for years, since the chance of a valid output per round of quantum computation would be too low.

@_date: 2013-06-10 15:09:44


Two rounds of SHA256 on the main block, which consists of the checksum of the previous block, a minting transaction to the miner, the new transactions and a 4 byte random number. Then, compare the output hash with the pattern to match (a number with a value lower than X, defined by the current mining difficulty).
To be able to reach more than 4.3 billion possible combinations to hash (4 bytes), you have to shuffle around the order of the transactions every 4 .3 billion attempts. Maybe this is where they speed things up? Don't know how/why that would account for a 30% speedup, though.

I assume the set of patterns he uses is very small, if it's fully random choice per character of one of 2 patterns, that's 50 bits. But he is likely to not have a fully random choice, more likely a repetition of which there's faaaaar fewer total possibilities. Then you just multiply that by a bunch of pattern types. Maybe it's got a total of 50 bits after you count all the possible starting positions and likely pattern combinations. Still likely somebody can rent that computing power for less than those 35 BTC is worth.

It wasn't based on the blockchain to start with. But the blockchain can be used for announcements and such. It could be used to have an absolute verifiable record of all old elections (though with false votes we need a way to use statistics to get an accurate analysis - maybe zero-knowledge proofs should replace nonces (don't know how yet), so we don't need false votes?).
By the way, maybe you'd just generate a checksum of your vote after you encrypted it to the SMPC public key (note that the vote message would always have a large random number, like an IV that is NOT kept, to prevent cryptoanalysis) that you could look for. Nobody can then know what you voted for, but you'll know your vote is recorded. Also, the SMPC could sign a list of all the checksums of the encrypted votes. So you remember what you voted for and know it was counted correctly, as long as you trust the SMPC participants.

Also, see Shamir's Secure Sharing Scheme, it lets you make shares of the keys such that at least any n of m is required to recover the data = you can require 2 of 3, or 5 of 5, or 3 of 7, or 55 of 72 shares. If you have at least as many shares as the threshold, no matter what combination of them you have, you can recover it. 
So you could choose to make 5 etched plates that has a seed for a deterministic wallet encoded, like an Electrum 12 word seed. And that seed would be entered into an SSSS client to create 5 shares with a threshold of 3 shares. And you can etch Qr codes of the shares on the plates and number them 1/5 -  5/5 and make a note that 3 of them are required. 
Recovery process is to scan the Qr codes, enter the shares into a SSSS client and to then enter the seed into a Bitcoin wallet that understands Electrum deterministic seeds. 
Then you can place the plates in different places.

But if you scanned the Qr code, why do you need radio signals? For as long as scanning the Qr code is *required*, it can also be used to initate any network connection (URL?), and thus radio identification is useless. Also, in 99.5% of all cases it would be a better idea to establish such a connection over the internet, not over some kind of local radio link.
If you don't require scanning the Qr code first, then it's trivial to spam irrelevant messages over the radio for anybody else, so you won't even find that one guy's message.

The safest and easiest way for most people is to let Electrum generate a 12 word seed, and to write that seed down on paper, and send the coins to the Electrum wallet.
To also keep the copy of the seed on the computer itself secure, you can use Diceware to create a strong password for Electrum to encrypt the seed with.
The most secure method is to delete the copy on the computer entirely and only enter the seed again on the computer when you want to spend bitcoins. But that might be too much work if you plan on using them a lot. If you don't plan on spending them, however, it is a good idea to delete that wallet file. If you haven't imported any addresses/keys into Electrum, and you HAVE written down the seed correctly, it is safe to delete that file, as you can recover all your addresses again that previously was generated from that seed.

There are various types of hidden weaknesses and backdoors, style can be incredibly stealthy. 
But Bitcoin never uses a single round of SHA256 directly, mining uses double rounds (breaks a shitton of theoretical exploits) and addresses uses SHA256 plus RIPEMD160, which also breaks most types of possible exploits. 
That combined with the level of public cryptanalysis means the risk is practically nonexistent.

"Creative destruction", I believe it's called. And they are handling it well. :) 
@_date: 2013-07-02 23:18:46
ECDSA, with the public key first hashed by SHA256 and then RIPEMD160 to create the address.
The hashing algorithm is irrelevant for the keys.

You don't need any client with the private key online to confirm it.
The private key is only needed to authorize transactions with the coins that is assigned to it's public key. So it can stay on that paper in a vault.

It wasn't strictly a bug, it was a changed setting in 0.8 that they didn't realize the consequences of in advance. If anything, that would be a bug in the 0.8 client since it unintentionally sometimes produced blocks that most clients on the network didn't accept.
What is and what is not a valid block is a part of the protocol. Those changes had an impact on what was considered a valid block or not.

Funnier twist:
Shamir's Secure Sharing Scheme is used, and the students have to find the others with shares from the same key and figure out how to cooperate to split the coins evenly and avoid having somebody stealing the coins. 
First group to claim their coins gets a bonus, and first group to do an even split also gets a bonus.

What is there to trust higher than crypto?
What if something shows up and replaces gold? Nah, wouldn't think so. Why would that happen for Bitcoin, considering that it can be updated if the majority agrees?
*Nothing* has inherent value. If I'm in the desert and only has enough food and water to get out of there, I will take *NOTHING AT ALL WHATSOEVER* as payment to sell my food and water to you. No gold, no cash, no nothing. Well, maybe a car, but only if it can get me out of there fast enough. The value lies in if it's useful to the person. Nothing is useful to *everybody, always*. Also, only a fraction of the gold in the world is used for industrial purposes, so no inherent value there either backing it.

They'd lag behind the alt that the original Zerocoin developers themselves are working on anyway. Litecoin doesn't actually have any notable advantages themselves.

It wouldn't have gotten anywhere otherwise anyway, nobody would (or should!) trust secret proprietary code to deal with anything like this! 
Bitcoin is meant to replace trust in the humans that run payment systems with trust in math (modern cryptography). And nobody trust secret math formulas. Algorithms like SHA256 is however trusted because thousands of experts from all over the world has tried cracking it and all failed. And anybody can verify their findings! 
Bitcoin is succeeding because anybody can verify it does what's advertised. People like Dan Kaminsky (well known security expert) have reviewed it and not found a single hole. And if you learn C++ programming, you can try as well. Some have hired teams of skilled hackers to go at it for months. Nobody has managed to crack it, not even with full access to the source code and documentation.

There are no intrisic value in among of those. None whatsoever. Your argument is simply invalid. 
There is nothing gold can't be replaced at. Same for the stocks. There are no absolute certainty in any promises of returns. All the value is based on how much people want them, the end. 
Bitcoin does not at all whatsoever derive it's value more from newcomers than gold or stocks do. It's scarce tokens, simple as that, and so is gold. There is no physics based reason to believe gold will get more valuable, just a social one where you might some that OTHERS simply will throw me money at it. 
Your argument around the supply is strange. Bitcoin mining as already at a very low level, and is provably limited. Less than half the coins remains to mine. No such thing is known for gold, for all we know we could have twice or ten times as much good on the market by next week. 
The value is absolutely not going to hit zero only because we know that 99% of the 21M coins will be mined by 2030 matter what happens in case mining doesn't stop. 
Why does the prices of gold go up? Because people think others will throw more and more money at it over time. Not because they think it became better at something. Isn't that a pyramid scheme? Speculation is rife for gold too, it even represents a significant part of its value (40% or so according to Wikipedia is used in finance, only a tiny fraction is used industrially). 
And your description of the money flow fits the stock market exactly.
Not to mention that a solution to the Byzantine generals problem, as well as smart contracts, are extremely valuable thanks to what they enable. Stocks are tied to companies that can fail, gold is a million times less flexible to manage, and lacks most of the features Bitcoin can offer. Gold can't really "survive" the appearance of a significantly better option, even if it will take centuries it's value won't last if people decide that it's shiny yellow surface isn't enough to put such great value in it. Room-temperature super conductors would wipe out most of the industrial market for gold. Then there's also use in jewelry, besides finance. The latter two are the major uses of it. 
Bitcoin in the other hand is a protocol that can be updated if needed.

If there's no difficulty change in the middle, then it's both the same thing since all blocks have the same difficulty.

Here's a better caluclation that takes probabilites and statistics into account (birthday attack):
(1 - (1-1/2\^160) ^ (2\^64 * (2\^64-1)/2) ) * 100
That gives you the the probability of finding a collision of private keys that both has the same RIPEMD160 hash (which is that the Bitcoin addresses are made of directly; they are checksums of the public key itself) if you can perform 2^64 key generation attemps. Note that this would include matches among the newly generated keys themselves, to actually find matches with just those keys that hold coins is even harder.
Somebody else could swap in the precise numbers for what a network the size of all Bitcoin miners could perform over something like 2 years. The probability is still likely to be close to zero.
Edit: Maybe 2^159 / (numbers of keys in the blockchain that holds coins) is a more accurate estimation of the number of required attempts to generate a key that matches a key in the blockchain that holds coins. But then you'll just get the coins of *one* address. Clearly not worth the cost.

It offers the same security since the blockchain can be verified the same way. You just don't *keep* all of it on the disk.
It will work if there's many nodes (multiple thousands at least) and most nodes stores at least several percent of it, then no block will be lost (with some certainty). The network can track which blocks are rare, Bittorrent style.
Scaling? That's harder. It's a matter of finding the blocks you need to verify a transaction fast enough. This will work well if there's enough "super nodes" (nodes that has the ENTIRE blockchain with all transactions) in the network to make sure it never takes too much time to find a given block. All exchanges will certainly run full nodes.
I know it can work, but I don't know enough to write a spec that could be implemented directly.

That is actually exactly what Tahoe-LAFS does - it's a system for distributed file storage. And running it over I2P adds additional anonymity.
You can always add delays on I2P. You can run any protocol you want over it. Heck, you can run Freenet over I2P! But Freenet is far less flexible, I2P won't work over Freenet.
How fast exactly is Freenet for those things? What is it's bandwidth? How does it prevent traffic analysis for live traffic?
I2P is trying to be a generalized anonymous network system. You can run whatever you want on top of it.

There is the blockchain that is a ledger that contains all previous transactions. Miners take new transactions and verify that the follow the rules and that they don't try to spend any money that doesn't belong to the spender, and then they bundle them up in a block together with a reference to the previous block. They then try to find a number that when combined with the block in a special way gives a number that mathes a certain pattern. That is hard work.

Why haven't I thought of this myself before? This is brilliant and even easy. You'd just scan a Qr code, and the app could even track the reputation of the wallet bot in question, by checking who owns it and if it's been honest in the past. The store could also have a list of trusted wallet bots, and your app would know which ones you have existing accounts at. As the wallet bots would likely know and trust each other, you could also move coins between these wallets with zero confirmations to move your coins from a wallet the store doesn't accept to one they do accept. 
This can even be automated to the degree where all the users has to do is to scan the code and enter an amount to spend.

What I'm saying isn't that it *certainly* will stabilize, but that I think it *likely* will stabilize when the market gets larger. With a decade or so at least until widespread adoption, I *think* the biggest Bitcoin-based innovations will happen before the masses comes (the people who finds all these new uses for things are usually among the early adopters).
Maybe all the focus here has ended up on the wrong word, though. While both value and price is important and overlap to some degree (in people's minds), we'll need to get the price (exchange rate) to stabilize to get "average joe" willing to test it. That good old S-curve comes to mind for the adoption rate, and we're still far to the left in those charts. Stability will come when the rate starts to slow down. However, we won't want major services to drop out every now and then if we want people to consider it valuable enough to join in. (Somewhat relevant: I remember when the Euro was new, and every other store here in Sweden accepted both SEK and the Euro (we didn't switch currency ourself). Nowadays almost nobody takes the Euro here, you have to exchange it to SEK first. So it isn't "valuable" to carry around Euro.)

This is a myth, and people should stop spreading it.
All quantum crypto so far is nothing other than quantum key exchange using entanglement, and then AES (classic crypto) is used using that key.
Also, how on earth would quantum signatures work?
Oh, and by the way, the type of quantum computers that people fear being built is still only Turing complete and nothing more than Turing complete. Whatever quantum crypto algorithms people will run on them will work on regular computers. I don't see how quantum algorithms would allow us to make stronger crypto than we already have. Quantum computers only really allow us to make *some* computations faster.
For asymmetric crypto algorithms, such as ECDSA that Bitcoin uses for digital signatures, there's already quantum resistant algorithms like McEliece that we can switch to.
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:28:36
Absolutely. There are no known shortcuts to SHA256, a very high certainty that there also are no unknown ones, the amount of power required is very predictable, the speed is predictable, the probabilities of finding a match is predictable, it won't get obsolete, difficulty is easy to adjust, there are no unfair advantages information wise, etc...

I don't think you understand how it works.
Bitcoin transaction fees goes to the person who mined the block that the transaction is registered in. If you only mine a block every 10 000 blocks, that means that you lose 9 999 of those transaction fees if you keep sending transactions, and only for one in 10 000 mined blocks you get your spent fees back. So you'll just lose most of the fees.

Yes, thanks to public key cryptography the sender only needs your address to send the coins, you don't have to be online. You use your private key once you want to spend to create a signature to prove that you have the right to spend them and to authorize the transaction.
You should have a separate computer that isn't internet connected, ideally running Linux with the Electrum wallet. You'd let the online machine create an unsigned transaction, use an USB stick to pass it on to the offline machine, let it sign it, and let the online machine then publish the signed transaction.

That depends entirely on the speedup possible compared to regular CPUs. Remember that we aren't talking about Bitcoin where the competition is massive and where ASICs are among the competitors, but something like Litecoin. As long as you can get an FPGA large enough for less than the market cap (hopefully at less than 1% of it) and it's fast enough, you're likely going to have the most efficient miner of everybody, and nobody else is likely to *ever* beat your efficiency. And even if that altcoin goes down the drain, if you sell off the coins you mine often enough you can simply jump between the ASIC-hating altcoins and make a profit. Just mine for long enough and you're golden. If the profit in $/Joule (earned money per watts per second) is higher for you than raw CPU miners, then if you're 3x as efficient and spent 100x as much, you just have to wait for 33.3x times as them before break-even, and then you've making 3x the profit per unit of time that they are.
Also, many FPGA:s have fast "memory shields" available.
Oh, and what kind of resources wouldn't be available?

You can't just add those percentages up directly, they need to be wheighted to account for transaction volume. 100% of a very small niche isn't much compared to 50% of a very large market.
USD market share * size of USD market relative to all currency trades + EUR market share * size of EUR market relative to all currency trades is what gives you the right number.
Edit: Guess I should RTFM more often. The percentage for the trade in each currency on each exchange is already adjusted to account for the total amount of trades.

Shamir's Secure Sharing Scheme.
Split up your private keys into several parts where AT LEAST n out of m pieces is needed to recover the keys. The numbers that m and n represent is up to you to chose, such as 2 of 3 or 7 of 11 or 32 of 44.
Then you give as many pieces as you feel like to the people you want to have them, making sure that no single person has enough to recover the keys himself. So 3 out of 5 people of your choice could be required to recover the keys, OR just your parents, or whatever else you want.
Pieces can be stored in bank vaults, by your lawyer, in a safe, etc...

The risk is that you might be forced to cash out right after a massive price drop. Even if the price would go back up, there's a real risk you'll lose money on it. Just consider an example of buying in at $1200, seeing the price fall to $700, having to cash out because some bill you need to pay showed up, and then price goes to $1300 but now you don't have any bitcoins left.

It does happen, repeatedly. You think I save every link about Cryptocat? You can find other RECENT discussions with Moxie on twitter about it being bad. I'm not at my computer, so hunting for links will have to wait for Monday or something like that. 
It's simply not just about cipher choice. That is only the most obvious part. Key distribution and the whole infrastructure is questionable. 
Cryptography is notoriously hard. If you make that many mistakes, there is no reason to believe you really understand it. There is no reason to trust you. Getting one thing right means nothing, you have to be consistently right. 
You don't get to make mistakes when lives are at stake. This is marketed towards people whose life are at risk. You just don't get to do that when you can't actually guarantee security. 
Promoting something that is insecure can get people killed. 
It has happened before. 
You only get to market something as secure if you can back it up. 
Telegram is similar, but at least they aren't marketing any existing chat client to anybody, just a crappy protocol that is dead in the water. 
I did see that. It was one of the more basic infrastructure problems (JS is never a good choice when you can't even trust the server). It still isn't a good protocol.

Because *brilliant* cryptography.
Proof-of-work is used to let a network of "miners" compete about being the first to generate a block that has a SHA256 checksum with the right pattern. That pattern is collectively adjusted once in a while to make sure a block is created every 10 minutes on average. Each block is also based on the previous one, creating what's called a "blockchain".
The one who creates a block gets to mine a few new bitcoins, currently 25 of them. All coins are "tracked" from their creation and forwards so that you always can be sure that every coin that is spent is valid. I can't spend coins I never received, only coins that I have received, and the first recipient of any given coins is the person who mined it, which is registered in the blockchain.

What remote exploit could you do if the programming is secure? If you can't sign your data packets with the right key they are just discarded.
NFC cards are different. They are like PIN-less debit cards. Somewhat like pure cash. They have no protection. There are credit cards with RFID/NFC showing up that's still PIN protected, and they are treated like any other debit/credit cards.
Chargebacks aren't there only for the physical aspect on credit cards. If the product you bought with cash breaks, you might not be able to get the money back if you want to return it. With credit cards, the credit card company deals with that for you.

The idea with SMPC is that it works like a virtual machine that *nobody* can see the inside of. Everybody agree on the code to run on it in advance, and it *only* works if everybody follows the protocol. No participant can know anything else than their own input and the output it specifically gave to them.


On who gets to participate in running the SMPC - we'll, it's a hard problem actually. But it's a social one, not technical one. To start with, I'd like to have a requirement of the organizations to have some degree of technical expertise. There could be serious problems if majority of the participants are hacked by the same entity. Everybody should be able to protect their own machines, and should use different setups to reduce the risk of a single exploit working against several of them at once.
Beyond that I really don't know. I think commercial organizations shouldn't be allowed to be one of them, but the organizations that participate could hire one to help them manage the system (and everything they do would have to be documented closely). At the very least I think that the basic requirement should be that the groups can prove to a reasonable degree that they have an interest in making sure the election is fair.
Of course these international election monitoring groups could be one of the participants.

Miner software clients can reject transactions without fees and those with fees lower than what they have decided to accept.
Fees are there partially to make sure the Bitcoin blockchain (transaction history) don't grow too fast, and also because minting of new Bitcoins eventually will stop, leaving transaction fees as the only income from mining.

Bitcoin is backed by trust in the math and algorithms behind it. 
Bitcoin is decentralized and have no entity or group who can singlehandedly change the rules of decide to create new coins. Coin generation is a process that all miners together take part of, and it is regulated by strict rules. 
Bitcoin is basically a protocol for generating and transferring ownership of tokens. Those tokens are useful as currency and is also called Bitcoins. The ownership is registered in the globally shared ledger called the blockchain.
When you send Bitcoins to somebody, the details of the transaction is sent to the miners who confirm if the transaction follows the rules, and if it does they will include it in the mining process. When they create a new block to include in the blockchain, your new transaction will be registered there which will let everybody know who the new owner is. Public key cryptography and digital signatures is what securely enforces ownership, if you keep your private key secret then only you can create valid signatures to spend your coins. 
When a miner manages to create a new block, he can also issue a limited amount of new coins to himself - if he breaks the rules, his block is ignored and he can then never spend those coins since they'll be considered invalid. At first each block could include 50 Bitcoins created, now it is limited to 25 per block. The rules are such that the halvings of the possible payout limits the maximum possible amount of Bitcoins to 21 million. Fortunately Bitcoins are very divisible, you can have 0.00000001 Bitcoins. 
The mining process is based on what is called "proof-of-work", where the chain of transaction blocks (blockchain) with the greatest amount of work behind it will be the one considered valid. This works since the hash algorithm SHA256 makes it easy to quickly verify that somebody else has spent at least a given account of computing power to find a specific value. Replacing any part of the blockchain require you to have more computing power than all the Bitcoin miners have together.

Then you should have a setup like with Electrum with the wallet seed on an offline computer and an online computer with Electrum but without the seed. Let the online one track how many coins you have, and you use the offline one to sign transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-13 10:42:24
You can have two clients of which one is online and the other is offline.
The online one tracks your coins for you and let you create unsigned transactions.
The offline one is then given the unsigned transaction via a USB stick, and is used to sign it. 
Then the signed transaction is given to the online one again, and is used to publish the signed transaction. 
Your private keys will then never be present on an online machine but can still be used.

Not really, if it's something like MD5 in a leaked password database, the best crackers can take that in days. Now those cracking rigs are pretty large, but then again they can crack a lot of passwords at once.
(26+26+10)^10 = 839 299 365 868 340 224, that's 840 thousand billions. On average you have to test half to find the password. There's one 25 GPU rig that does 350 billion per second. So 333 hours to crack it. Now that's not MD5 hashes, but MD5 is fast too, maybe even faster. A 1 000 GPU rig (might sound extreme, but within range for some shady operations) can do it in 8 hours. Note that this is 8 hours for that entire database (well, most of it). And that's assuming pure random bruteforce, most people don't select entirely random passwords. Oh, and let's throw in newer GPUs too that's 10x faster or so, and maybe 3 000 GPUs and a botnet, because you can afford that after a while when you run that type of shady operations. Suddenly it's just minutes to crack most passwords in a database.

I've already heard that story. It was a clever way to hide the gold. And private keys for Bitcoin can be split into a thousand pieces with a [secure sharing scheme]( where even the individual shares could be hidden with steganography in images and more. A bit similiar to dissolving gold. :)


Subtle stab at Bitcoin? ;) Well, it's going to stabilize at some point. It sounds like your argument for gold is it's age and how deeply it's rooted in our culture (which a result of it's age).
But do you know *why* it was *gold* that became so valuable?
It has a combination of properties that absolutely nothing else had. And now so does Bitcoin. Can you send gold over the globe in minutes? Bitcoin has many of the most important properties of gold and several new and unique ones! Price stability is a question of waiting until the market understands what it is and how it works. It's just 4 years old! (Well, technically 5 years, it was started in 2008 and released in 2009). It's going to take at least decades, but I don't mind. I'm in it for the long run.

What about a Mars coin that can support merged mining with Bitcoin, but where only every ~20th Marscoin block is used to base merged mining on? So they still have one block every 10 minutes, and they mine locally themselves.
You could do it something like this: Marscoin has it's own mining just like regular. And when it hits block 20, it's relayed to miners on Earth. Mars miners keeps mining like normal. When the first earth miner has mined a second block on the Marscoin chain, it's relayed to Mars. And then the Marscoin miners base the next block after that on *both* their own previous block and that earth mined block. And to ensure it's still secure enough, Marscoin would require at least one block to have been earth-mined with a higher difficulty than the local blocks in between every 20th blocks (so you can't just do a low-difficulty mining 51% attack from Earth where you "forget" earth-mined blocks).

The blockchain don't accept new blocks with the same hash as a previous one.
Transactions have ECDSA signatures, they're not signed with hashes. Lamport signatures takes too much space (and would just be harder to break).

Now, let's add to that the fact that Grover's algorithm allows quantum computers to halve the keyspace using quantum computers. Even then it is not even physically possible to break asymmetric keys longer than ~630 bits (including a margin of error). By that I mean *ever*.

You should point out that the chain with the greatest amount of computational power wins, which is how everybody agree on a single chain. And it has been working great so far, and is likely to keep working as an attack is more expensive than what can be gained, and always only is temporary.
And that just very basic statistical math together with the randomness/unpredictability/lack of control over of the SHA256 output is what enables proof-of-work being used this way, where difficulty can be specified. And how exactly the blocks are chained (the SHA256 checksum takes both the transactions AND the hash of the previous block as input, creating a chain).

If you use the same address for every transaction, then it's visible to anyone how much bitcoins you have recieved. Would you prefer a method where a new address is automatically generated for each transaction for a little bit of financial privacy?
Here's a very technical description of a way to do that (but don't worry, the software can do all that for you automatically): 
Your web server can generate new addresses for every transaction without even having the private key, just based on one "master public key" (the addresses are based on public keys), and your Bitcoin client software will still be able to generate the correct private keys for all those public keys (thanks to how the ECDSA algorithm works). So the risk of stolen bitcoins from getting the server hacked is very small (although a hacker *could* replace the address that the visitor sees, but you'd probably notice that pretty fast since they'll probably contact you if that happens).
You can then use a wallet client like Electrum on a secure personal computer (you really shouldn't use that computer for anything else, you can get a cheap laptop for that) and make backups of the private keys (or in Electrum's case, the "seed" they are based on) in a few secure places (bank vault or in a safe of your own).
You should read up on keeping your Bitcoin wallet secure.

Except that whatever algorithm you design will not be optimally efficient on the vast majority of CPUs, as I already stated. However you design it, most miners will run it on CPUs that are less efficient than the optimized designs I could load onto an FPGA. I can still run it faster than them. "More power efficient" is the whole point. ASICs are more power efficient than everything else in Bitcoin mining, that's why people are paying so much for them (77BTC for Avalon miners the last time I checked). If that FPGA would give you a large enough fraction of the mining for low enough electricity costs, you're going to make a profit.
Also, there are some standalone large FPGAs. Not all FPGAs are just sold as ICs.

Secure Multiparty Computation. Nobody ever holds the private key in a decrypted version, or even a decryption key for it. A new keypair is created by the client and the server (in the first round, private key is kept for the second round securely using Shamir's Secure Sharing Scheme), and neither can read the private key, and the coins are then sent to it's public key, and that keypair is used to create a time-locked transaction (in the second round).
The user and the server only ever gets the signed transactions that then can be published on the blockchain. And they both then deletes their cryptographic shares of the private key from the Shamir's Secure Sharing Scheme, so the private key can not be recovered. Since neither of them have all the shares, neither can reconstruct the private key.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:49:03
It keeps it on the computer. It's encrypted with the password Electrum likely asked you to enter at the first startup. If that password is weak, or if you've got a keylogger on the computer, the coins can be stolen if somebody can get to the file it's stored in.

Which model? I2P with Bote mail? Because I2P is an anonymizing network like Tor's hidden services, and Bote mail is a P2P system using DHT for mail distribution inside it, with cryptographic public keys as addresses and everything encrypted. I don't see how you get more anonymous than that, especially when it's trivial to share 1000 addresses is advance and only use each address once.


You obviously have no clue how packet switched networks works. For the last time, can you please tell me HOW you think the VPN knows who each recieved packet is intended for? Don't technobabble yourself out of it with words like "connection" and "accosiated". Give me actual technical details, please.


Yeah, and the packets are tagged with those numbers. The VPN sends the requests with those numbers, the servers send the response back with the same numbers so the VPN know which is which. In Tor's case, all connections from each client has the same tag. Same thing for lots of proxies. And I wouldn't be surprised if many VPNs do the same. So, can you point me to where the VPN companies explain their implementation details on this?

I've found this which apparently doesn't require cryptographically strong hashes: 
But you're still a bit drastic if you assume there's no cryptographically secure hash function. It's reasonable to assume that 2^200 operations is implausible to ever compute, and considering Grover's algorithm and that it's pretty certain there's nothing more efficient at bruteforce than that against most classical algorithms, then you can have a +500 bit hash (or even a +1000 bit hash if you want to) and consider it secure enough. I seriously doubt that even if P = NP it's possible to spend less operations than that to find a matching input for ALL possible hash outputs at ~1000 bits. Otherwise it would imply that all possible hash algorithms leaks a very significant amount of data about it's input.
(Still reading that link I mentioned above, FYI)




I didn't mean unbreakable. "Strong" = "can't be broken in 100 years" is what I meant.




So you verify the one time pad by creating a one time pad? How do you verify the *new* one time pad? And doesn't that lead to key reuse? (I'm talking about authentication here. One time pads != authentication. The quantum machine itself can't authenticate the physical person using it.)

I don't think all that should be plain public data (malicious data mining, hello NSA!), IMHO it should be encrypted with a key shared between the sender and the recipient (how to exchange keys is a separate matter). The users could of course chose to make it public if they wish.

The SHA algorithms are hash algorithms, not encryption algorithms. AES512 is not a standard, only AES128/192/256 is. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:38:41
There is 2^160 possible addresses. Divide that with the number of addresses in use. The mining difficulty can in theory be set so high that only one in 2^256 values are valid blocks. 
So then you could have something like a difficulty where 2^(256-160) * (addresses in use) of the 2^256 possible values would be valid for it to be of equal difficulty, NOT considering that computing the ECDSA public key and checking if it has coins is harder than simply doing SHA256 hashes. So that would be in the range of something over 2^100 of the 2^256 values, which is around one in every 2^150 tested values. 
2^128 is used for AES128, a commonly used encryption algorithm that is considered highly secure.

Well, SHA256 then if that's used in the blockchain. The problem with a hole in SHA256 is that somebody with a few ASIC:s could match the entire rest of the network if the SHA256 hole reduced the complexity by 3-4x or more. Usually, new breaks in algorithms like this are on the scale of reducing the complexity by 100-10 000x (which is why the algorithms are designed with serious safety margins).

Feel free to use multiple Truecrypt containers and back then up all over the place. You can use hidden volumes inside file based volumes too. 
If you use a deterministic wallet, all new keys will be generated from a single seed. Then you don't need to make repeated backups after having used it for a while.

It's partially for the same reason that statistics usually has to be based on large datasets to be considered representative - the fewer data points the more risk for great variations as there's a risk that every datapoint is on one of the extreme ends, and with more datapoints the risk is significantly less that all your datapoints are one the same extreme side.
When talking about markets, what it means is that people buy things at different times, people value different things, and with more people involved, then all the small trends fade away in the masses and you've got a big trend left of the overall market behaviour. In a small group everybody might be speculators, or fashion lovers, or tech geeks, or whatever. In a large group we have them all and the behaviour of any single group has less impact. A hundred small trends of quickly jumping up and down blends into each other and becomes one curve that moves slowly simply because the probability is so extremely low that all the small trends are nearly identical and overlap strongly.

Difficulty is included in the 0.0001 number, the probability that each generated hash is a match. The second number is the number of hashes since last block. The output is the probability of a block being generated.
Mining is done with SHA256 and comparing that output with a pattern which is hard to find a match to. That pattern defines the difficulty and is calculated by estimating the hashrate in the network.
And again: Funny that you didn't factor in the fact that it previously have taken for example at least 43 minutes between two blocks. That is not possible if there's a 100% probability that it will take no more than 10 minutes, because that would leave a 0% probability that it takes more than 10 minutes. Yet it happened. Please learn statistics.

You can also use lightwheight wallets, they rely on servers holding the blockchain. It's faster but requires that you trust the servers to some degree.


There is, but you might have to use tools that let you create your own "tx" (transaction).
Also, why not use a deterministic wallet and store the seed on the paper? That way the change address will always be one of those generated from the seed any time you use it, and all addresses generated from the seed is generated the same way every time. So no coins is lost, just regenerate the addresses.
And a last note, you can use the original paper wallet's address as the change address to simply just send the change coins right back.

From what I read in a thread in their forums, Bitmessage seems to be full of holes in the design. Somebody that can wiretap the connection (such as the ISP or somebody with Wireshark on the same WLAN) can for example be sure about which messages originates from the person they're spying on. And that includes being able to link replies to public key requests to the person you're wiretapping.
Bote mail don't have these issues, because it work on top of I2P which is robust and routes data packets by default, hiding what originates where and when. It's very well protected against ISP spying. And on top of that, Bote mail has some pretty efficient extra features, such as random delays on messages over several steps.

Because you get a majority agreement through a proof of work system that is insanely hard to mess with. You need a 51% attack to create "fake" blocks. Also, mining only takes *cryptographically signed* transactions and simply includes them in the blockchain.

Wouldn't work. That would be abused hard, anybody could create a massive amount of transactions to boost the amount of mined bitcoins, and they could attack the peer-finding mechanisms (making millons of fake nodes, giving fake IP:s to connect to, etc) to slow down transactions and decrease the amound of mined bitcoins (although this will be harder than the first attack).
No (non-static) algorithmic solution can work. And yes, basing it on the amount of transactions is also algorithmic. Things like fixed supply or fixed increase can work. And of those two, I actually believe that a fixed supply is more reasonable.

Actually, it's more complex than that since you have to consider the potential differences in overhead costs (buying and building the rig) and operational costs (maintenance and electricity) and variability in payback (number of Bitcoins per computed hash * predicted market value at the point where you plan to spend the coins).
So it's a graph over total expense (hardware plus variable electricity costs and more) vs unpredictable changes in difficulty and Bitcoin value.
So essentially it's about how efficient your hardware is more than anything. How many hashes it can compute during it's lifetime vs the total cost of it during it's lifetime is the key. The more hashes you get for the money, the more coins you can get.
BTW: This could help you figuring out how a graph should look:

Still proabilities and statistics we are talking about. Your chances are only impacted by your pool's % of the total power. There's not really much consistent good or bad look in guessing which SHA256 strings will match a given pattern. Even with continously increased difficulty, if all pools grow at similiar rates then in average any given miner in a given pool will have the same amount of "luck". For all possible outcomes over time, a certain percent will have a certain outcome. 
The comments on the payment scheme is the only critizism you've got here that is based on fact. If you need, I could prove my math. Might be hard to understand for you, though.

They create block headers for the miners to find hashes for. The miners reports partial matches (below the network difficulty, above a threshold set by the pool) so that the pool can estimate the hashing contribution of each miner and thus split payouts correctly. 
In centralized pools, the coins goes straight to the pool who splits it, in P2Pool it's a bit more complex, but your mining shares is only considered valid by that decentralized pool if you mine based on blocks that would distribute the coins as according to the shares reported. It uses a rolling blockchain of it's own for tracking the shares.

How do you securely agree on a global price tag for the coins? You don't. So that will fail.
By the way: Take a look at Freicoin.

1: Yes. If your wallet was encrypted, you've got a much higher chance of transferring the coins out before the thief.
2: Only if you use deterministic wallets based on seeds like Electrum or Armory has. You only have to sync these once.
Not if you use one like Bitcoin-Qt where each keypair/address is generated separately at random. You CAN however still sync over all the individual keypairs/addresses between two computers, but you have to sync again every time new addresses are created.
3: Yes, Bitcoin has doublespend protection (the main feature of the blockchain!) and will only accept one of those transactions.

Gold was a form of energy all along anyway. Those quarks can become photons. You can have trillions and trillions of photons from tiny amounts of energy and split that further. Why are you setting an arbitrary limit for that particular constellation of particles?

Middlecoin would be a pool you might want to look into 
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:15:26
A global distributed ledger of account that tracks ownership of tokens that we call bitcoins. The ledger is both updated and protected with a process called mining that consists of verifying new transactions, bundling them in a block and then performing some hard computations based of a type that we call proof-of-work, which is based on the current latest block in the ledger (blockchain) and on your own block. In blocks you create you  get to assign some tokens (bitcoins) to yourself, and you also get to claim the fees given in the transaction you bundled up in the block.

Let's say A, B and C all use proxy (or VPN) P. They all log in on the same site S. Now S has to send 3 different responses to P. How does P know which of A, B and C it should send the replies to? Because each request that P passed on to S had different tags. That's how it identifies those connections.
Now, if you visit two different sites, then depending on the proxy, it might not use the same tag, but for example Tor does reuse the same tag, which is why you can be identified if you use Tor for both Facebook and something you need to keep anonymous at the same time. If the proxy uses different tags for every single client-site connection, then you can't correlate the traffic easily that way, but if it uses one tag per client, then it's trivial.


VPN = virtual private network. It's actually primarily used by large companies, so that users in different buildings can use their networks as if they are one single network. It's not meant to be anonymous in most cases.

Your image has too low resolution for my OCR, it interpreted at least one M as H. That won't stop any actual attackers, though, as they can automate most of these attacks. It will only make it a little harder for me to check your methods.

So use multiple copies? And it's not like it's easy to recover lost letters either way. I would suggest a few "large-pixeled" Qr codes with maximum error correction. And avoid paper that "crumples".

Diceware plus brainwallet software works equally well. About 8-9 words is good enough at around 100 bits, 14 words represent over 160 bits and is the cap set by RIPEMD160 for when it doesn't make sense to add more entropy.

No need to be designed around quantum computing. McEliece seems to resist quantum algorithms so far and dates abck to the 70's. It just happens to be based on a problem that quantum computers can't crack (that we know of). There are others too, and we can design new ones if needed.

A Faraday cage don't have to be plugged in. You might be thinking of grounding it, though, which is a good idea. You can connect just ground only on the microwave to something like a metal surface in a building structure, those are almost always grounded. Kitchen sinks or water pipes or whatever.

Not you, the network as a whole changes it in response to the total amount of hashing power. If total network power goes up, so does difficulty.

Unless they get to you before you publish the key.
My idea is somewhat similiar;
Basically it's to have several random numbers where only one is the real one, and they're all attached to different votes. So you can fake what you voted for and still know your real vote is counted correctly.

No, most people here seems to say the same thing, just differently.
Let's say you mine a block. You get the minted coins (currently you get 25 BTC per block, this is halved from time to time) from that mined block + the mining fees from the transactions you validated by including in the block.
When you later send that with a transaction fee, it doesn't matter who first mined those coins. The miner who includes the transaction in the blockchain is the person who gets those transaction fees. You only get them if you are the one who mines the block who contain your own transactions. If somebody else mines it, you don't get the fees.

Well, it actually has to be *possible* to begin with, though.
But we do know now that decentralized anonymous markets aren't impossble to make. Bitcoin was thought to be impossible at first, but now we know it clearly can work, and there's things like OpenTransact as well which is a federated market system.

I'm not making the same interpretation as you do. Though I can see why you want it to be so strict that not any participation at all should be allowed in something an agency haven't been given explicit permission to participate in.
But then again, SMPC *does* enforce clean separation. Having an agency provide a secure computer for the task doesn't seem to be much different for me than to share conference rooms or whatever else it might be. Sharing a conference room (assuming it's not bugged) gives no significant power to one agency over another.
I can see your point on international election monitors, but I guess you can see the need to allow for it countries with plenty of corruption and cheating in elections? Of course each state is free to decide who and who not to allow to participate.

Electrum is free and open source, nothing proprietary, and it let you sign transactions offline. 
Create the unsigned transaction on an online computer, give it to the offline computer, and let the offline computer sign it, then give the signed transaction to the online computer to be published to the Bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 22:39:08
That won't really recoup the investment as the ASICs that's goign to be shipped soon will make the mining difficulty go up. Spending that money on Bitcoins directly will likely pay off better.

Wrong, wrong, wrong.
Electrical failure can take forever to show. You can have a too thin wire or bad isolation at plenty of points, and nothing ever happens until that day when you plug in a computer there are run it for more than an hour...
Also, circuit breakers can only tell if the electricity is "leaking" (not returning in the wires) or if there's too high power draw. They can't always tell if some metal surface is exposed to wires or if something is too hot.

I think trust-reductionism might be more accurate. Because essentially Bitcoin is designed to allow you to reduce the amount of trust you need to place in others through the use of things like cryptography and decentralization.

@_date: 2013-09-09 18:49:34


Emphasis mine.
Also, to be able to reuse a key you need to apply a one time pad each time to the authentication tag, and that one time pad must be distributed together with that key in the first place.
So the first QKD OTP you create and authenticate needs to fit multiple one time pads for future use for future authentication tags.
If you later on want to send larger messages than approximately the square of the key size, you need to authenticate the message in parts and use up several one time pads for the tags, so you might need to perform a new QKD one time pad exchange first for those tags.
The overhead isn't exactly light. You need to perform QKD OTP exchanges practically *all the time*.
And that is still assuming that QKD can be implemented securely.

It means there's no taxation on exchanging Bitcoins here in Sweden. No VAT or anything else like that.

And there's no proof that a secure quantum crypto system can be built.


I should have been clearer. For all *possible* outputs, as in whatever the output is you can find a valid input.


Because even that unconditionally secure authentication system is using hashes (though in a very specific way). You can't verify the one time pad your quantum system generated without meeting in person OR using hashes with a key you exchanged in person.
Also, you're wrong. Hashing is already "broken" in that with enough computing power you can break any hash. The question is if there's a "reasonable" has function with reasonable key sizes usable for MAC and a reasonable output that can not be cracked with less than about 2^200 operations or with a quantum computer.
 &gt; In any cryptographic sense, public key cryptography, and hash functions, are completely broken if P=NP.
P = NP does NOT mean that it's trivial with limited computational resources. It only means that the difficulty for any given problem isn't excessively absurdly massively astronomical relative to the size of the problem, but it can still be out of reach. You can still have problems (for example like hash bruteforce) where finding a valid input for an output is harder than computing the output for that input.


According to the link I posted above, unconditionally secure authentication requires that the key is of a size roughly proportional to the logarithm of the message size (your one time pad). So 256 bits is likely not enough for large messages.
My point with hashes and all that is that chances are that there's SOME cryptographic algorithm where the input is hard to figure out given the output, that can be used to construct a stream cipher or equivalent, allowing you to use that same key for classical crypto instead, and that this is FAR more likely than that you actually can build an un-MITM-able quantum system in which the key/one time pad can not be learned by the attacker.

This is absolutely not my only argument, just support for the claim that his key is nearly certainly not strong enough against any knowledgable attacker who are willing to spend a few minutes on setting up a bruteforce attack and some search scripts.


Why? Just using a secure password on a machine that is properly protected against malware is enough for most, and hardware wallets will provide much better security as well once they show up. What I am saying is that his homebrew key generation algorithm is a bad idea.

Kind of, yes.
Generate a vanity address.
Encode the private key as a list of words. 256 bits can be represented with 16 words selected from a wordlist with 65536 words. 16 bits per word since 2^16 = 65536, 16 words since 256/16 = 16. If the first 16 bits are 0000 0000 0000 0000, then you pick the first word from the list to represent those bits. If it's 0000 0000 0000 0001, you pick the second word. And so on, until 1111 1111 1111 1111 that represents the last word on that list.
And when you enter it into the software, it converts the words back to bits the same way.
Words are easier to remember than random characters.

Yeah, that's the point. With quantum crypto you need a non-quantum way to agree on settings for the quantum machines, or something similiar. If you can agree on that then you have a channel for unmodifiable communications, and then you should use that for regular public key crypto and save tons of money instead in hardware costs.


Then you implement all of these schemes in parallell. NTRU and McEliece is apparently quantum resistant, and RSA 4096 bit should be strong enough for decades even against NSA.


Why would I do that? I'm not specifying *what* kind of channel that would be. I'm just saying that if you have one that you can use, then you can share public keys over it and be done. Or if you also know it isn't wiretapped, then you can use it for all of your communications.


But then you MUST meet in person to be able to set up your quantum machine, if there's no secure public key crypto. And the lots of quantum crypto mechanisms so far has been found insecure because their assumptions were inadequate and still allowed full undetected MITM.

Vanitygen plus Zint barcode studio.
You can set it up via the command line to generate a ton of Qr codes with a private and public key each (you want it done such that each keypair has both Qr codes named something like [public key here]-address.png and [public key here]-private.png, and you could set it up so that the public key is in text form on the Qr code images too. This can then be sent to a printer in pairs (such that both Qr codes for each pair is on the same paper).
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:41:15
NTRU isn't vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, and no other quantum algorithm is known that would break it. The best one known is probably still just Grover's algorithm, which is more or less a generic search algorithm, and that one only halves the keyspace which means that you can just double the amount of bits to keep the same security level against it.
Also; 
It's now 100% free to include in open source projects.

In the summer people want to swim and to eat icecream. So the summer heat is the common cause.
Far from all miners instantly dump their coins on the markets, and most coins on the market isn't newly mined, so that kills the idea that it would have a substantial effect.
And then there's the fact that Bitcoin blocks are continously mined at roughly the same pace no matter the difficulty (though changes in mining power will temporarily change the block mining rate), and that each block pays out the same amount (halvings every 4th year not counted).
So assuming the same ratio of miners keeps putting their coins on the market, there's no reason to assume supply and demand would be impacted by difficulty.
Maybe Bitcoin miners would always set higher asking prices for their coins as a result of higher difficulty, but that still has no significant effect since they only represent a small portion of the coins on the market.
The common cause for higher prices and higher difficulty is more people joining the Bitcoin network, buying coins and adding new miners.

Finding a random number that combined with the latest unconfirmed transactions and the checksum of the previous block gives a SHA256 checksum output that matches a given pattern.
Finding it and publishing it verifies those transactions, so that the recipients now can use the coins they recieved, knowing that the sender can't respend them (which otherwise would make it either insecure or non-scarce).

You only covered 10 characters, that's 58^10 possibilities or 57 bits of entropy. While that's still not tiny, it is *NOT* beyond reach of powerful cracking rigs. Keys larger than that has been cracked before thousands of times, and up to 80 is assumed to be crackable.
And actually, the way ECDSA works you actually "just" have 128 bits of security from the 256 bit private keys when the public key is known, so you really just have 30 bits of security there which any tower PC can crack.
And last of all, pixelation isn't secure, you need to black the characters out completely, otherwise characters can be figured out directly from that image!

You can make offline Bitcoin transactions already today. Then you just send that off to the network that the miners for the Bitcoin blockchain is connected to. So all Earth-signed Marscoin transactions would have to be directed to Mars somehow, probably by the Bitcoin clients having support for "Mars proxies" for Marscoins. It's not like we'll have a common interconnected internet (too slow) and will be able to connect our clients to the miners on Mars.
So when you buy something from Mars (most likely online services), you'll likely first make an exchange with a local exchange for Marscoin (think forex), then send the transaction to Mars, probably via a proxy the exchange has. And the same goes in the other direction.

A non-deterministic wallet generates each new key from new random numbers each time, each independent of the former. Having all the previous ones won't help you guess the next one.
With deterministic wallets, all keys are derived from the same seed. The same set of keys are always derived each time from that seed. So that seed can represent thousands of keys, and you only need that seed to figure out which the next key would be. The whole purpose with them is to simplify backups and such.
I haven't actually *used* other clients than Bitcoin-Qt and Armory. Don't know any details about Multibit.
Either way, you need the private keys to use your coins. If you've got those, you're good to go.
You need to protect the private keys from hackers/malware and such. Usually all it takes is to use strong passwords and to not click the wrong links. You should make sure you have an updated antivirus. Backing up your wallet on Dropbox is fine if it's encrypted with a strong password.

No, what matters is the actual probability of that chain being orphaned, and that is impacted BOTH by relative hashing power of the attacker AND the number of confirmations. To just make the time shorter between confirmations also makes it more likely for an attacker to at some point succeed with an attack since there's less checksums to compute per block and more blocks in total over the same amount of time = more opportunities to pull it off.
If confirmation time is lowered, you have to wait for more blocks if you want the exact same level of security.

Did it take you two weeks to come up with that idea?
If you as a miner are willing to go for something not maximally optimal, you can implement the most common crypto primitives in the form of "crypto engines" hooked to general-purpose CPU designs (there's a few of those out there already), still allowing you to run any hash function you want, faster than most ordinary CPUs.
Most hashes are based on the same set of basic designs, applied in different ways with different tweaks. You can take a look at the different hash designs out there - for example MD5 and the SHA1 and SHA2-type hashes are all based on the same basic principles.

I've read about several methods where you need to configure the machines to measure certain properties. I'll try to find a link.
Either way, you MUST have some shared key, otherwise it's easy for any random person to physically take the place of the person you really wanted to talk to, or even to cut the fiber and place his own quantum machines in the middle. You just can't know who you're actually talking to otherwise.


In which case you need to verify the one time pad generated. How do you do that? Share a key in person and use HMAC? Then you need a secure hash algorithm as well. Oh, by the way, you can create secure stream ciphers if you have secure hash algorithms, so then you still don't need quantum. If you can't verify it with hash algorithms, then you need to meet in person to verify the one time pads, and yet again you can just agree on a one time pad in person and once again drop the quantum part.




Which part? If there's strong public key crypto (not proven) or that IF it exists, it's PRACTICALLY as strong as quantum crypto (I'm 100% sure of that)?

There are actually places where you can pay with bitcoins for food and for rent. Not that many though.


No upkeep from you when it comes to the actual problems being solved. You just have to keep the machine internet connected and running and updated. What will cost you is hardware costs and electricity, and basically what is being done during mining is what is called "proof-of-work", you have to prove that you did something hard (well, it's the *computer* that does it) to earn bitcoins.


Yes, a single bitcoin is worth a lot. Also, it's divisible to 8 decimal places, so you can have 0.00000001 of a bitcoin.


Yes, many people are willing to pay for bitcoins. It's scarce and unique, and for many that's enough to make it worth something, enough to be used in trade.


There is a few places that will pay you in bitcoins. Again, just very few so far.


Your brain. That's what's you've got to avoid scams. There are of course also 3rd party services like escrows, but those STILL require trust and thus application of your own brainpower to evaluate.
Miners "approve" transactions through including them in the blockchain. There is very little reason to specifically attempt to exclude transactions to a single entity (like a person or organization), since it's easy to switch addresses all the time thus making it hard to block. Also, they can only APPROVE transactions that users have issued, they CAN NOT FAKE transactions. At most a group of miners can EXCLUDE some, but then OTHER miners will include it. You'll just have to wait longer for inclusion if that happened.


To securely manage authorization of transactions, every user has his own cryptographic keypairs that is required to send and recieve coins. You use your public key from the pair as an address to recieve coins, and the private key (which must remain secret) is needed to create cryptographic signatures that can be verified as being made by you and only you (since only you have the private key from that keypair). To send coins belonging to a given public key, you NEED the private key from THAT public key's keypair. It's impossible to create a fake signature since it would take faaaar to much computing power to try, you would need a computer the size of our galaxy to do it. And obviously nobody has such a thing.
So, WALLETS are then simply a bunch of keypairs. To be precise, ECDSA cryptographic keypairs. It has both your public keys and your private keys. You can safely create copies of the wallet file and store it in multiple places, BUT you should be aware that IF ANYBODY ELSE GETS THE PRIVATE KEYS, then they can steal your coins. So usually the private keys are encrypted and/or stored in a safe place nobody else can get to.
If you lose ALL copies of your private keys or if you lose your password to decrypt them, then YES your coins is lost, since you can no longer authorize transactions.


Yes, if the business accepts it. There's wallet clients for smartphones. All that business need is a regular computer with an internet connection. You give you an address, you send the coins there, and then they verify that they received your bitcoins.


That's for the entire network of miners. The mined coins are spread out among the miners proportionally to how much computing power they spend on mining. This is a result of how the SHA256 based proof-of-work system works.

BTW: Does this use fingerprints? I would never ever trust anything that uses fingerprints for passwords. Almost all, even most of the high-profile super expensive fingerprint readers have been hacked or tricked before. Also, you put your fingerprints *everywhere* on a daily basis, and you can't revoke your fingerprints if somebody else gets a copy...
Edit: Maybe something that scans the eyes can be secure enough for average people. It would be too costly for most people to fool an eye scanner (though even that can be done by people with enough resources, but there's still a high cost per eye-scan to fake). One thing that has been said a lot in security - security is all about making an attack more costly than your attacker can gain on a successful attack.

Each qubit are by definition *and choice* in a superposition that when measured becomes 0 or 1. The probability manipulation is there to make it take the value you want it to have, which would be the answer to your problem that you gave the quantum computer to solve.
The most simle way to do it is to have many qubits and have them be in superposition between state A and state B (0 or 1). You could probably have more states possible, but that's just too messy. Getting many qubits work together with just two states possible for each is hard enough.

Proof-of-work mining has several purposes. Decentralized minting and decentralized verification of transactions/doublespend protection are BOTH important. The enforced scarcity that is the result of minting as a result of proof-or-work + halved payouts according to a prespecified timeframe is a big reason for why you can be certain it stays valuable (for as long as nothing replaces it).


Not the verification part, no, but you CAN issue transactions. See IP over Avian Carrier! :D


How do you do that without enabling copying? How can people read the right values that allow them to confirm it without being able to create particles that show the same values? If it can be read over and over without breaking, nothing stops you from essentially trying to bruteforce it on your own and doing the same verifications against your own particles until it matches. What makes it strong enough?

One last attempt to make you understand:
There's a set of all SHA256 outputs.
There's a small subset of valid outputs. There's a (much) larger subset of invalid outputs.
The number of outputs generated every 10 minutes is smaller than the large subset.
Outputs during mining are generated randomly, each output is independent from the one generated and tested before.
Therefore there is a non-zero chance that in a 10 minute period, no valid output is found, since all the outputs found may be in the larger and invalid set, therefore there is a non-100% chance of creating a block in 10 minutes.
Not even once you've generated all values in the large set which are invalid you're going to reach 100% certainty of finding a value in the small valid set, because you might find the same invalid value twice in that larger set. Nothing in SHA256 prevents a collision like that (it's just unlikely without a supermassive amount of computing power, but remains possible).

Is it possible to run a network securely where *anybody* can run a validation node with the Ripple software? because if not then Ripple is just as centralized as anything else, just "federated" like how email is rather than fully peer-to-peer.
First of all, you don't need to trust any humans when you store your coins in your own Bitcoin wallet. Those coins will be spendable for as long as somebody is running mining nodes, which could include you.
You can verify with near total certainty using math that the coins you've recieved in your wallet really are yours and will remain yours, without trusting anybody else.
There's no servers you can DDoS. Miners can be run behind massive firewall boxes and over Tor, and there's tons of them, so on Bitcoin you wouldn't even notice a DDoS attack against miners.

But then you can't authenticate later QKD generated one time pads unless you use the output from the first QKD generated one time pad as key material, in which case you're wasting resources. 


Authentication key (pre-shared secret) reuse is possible if you use one time pads specifically for the authentication tags. If you do not authenticate the one time pad generated by the QKD, then you have no security.


Exactly. That one time pad is 100% worthless if it isn't authenticated. That's why you need an authentication key. Otherwise you can never now who really was on the other end of your QKD scheme.
If you do not want to be limited by the number of messages you can send, then you must use the QKD output as key material for later messages. Your choices is between using it for one new +2 kilobit authentication keys per future message or 128 bit one time pads for future authentication tags enabling you to reuse that pre-shared secret = authentication key.

Ideally you should have some kind of cheap physical security token, plus backup tokens. One backup at home, maybe one at work, one in a bank vault. Put them wherever you want. I would prefer a smartcard of some sort.
If you need to change what you store on them, they could share a keypair that can't be extracted and let you backup an encrypted file of the current data, that can be synced to the other cards. This could even be automatic, when you connect it to a reader then the reader could be told fetch that file right away and pass it on to the card.

The difference is that the ID proof most likely is "reusable", and thus can be convincingly given to others. You'll likely have a signature as output. 
Zero-knowledge proofs don't allow that. Only the challenger/verifier can be convinced by the given proof, since the algorithms requires the verifier to provide a unique random string used as challenge. You can only trust a proof to not be forged if you generated the challenge yourself or is it was cryptographically and deterministically generated (like based on a checksum of something an attacker can't modify). A ZKP can prove citizenship without revealing your identity. ***Anything*** that is computationally verifiable can be proven without revealing anything other than a yes/no answer.
You can use the same ID with tons of people and only those who you want to know your identity can know it.

This part doesn't make sense. If the attacker learns the private key, there's nothing that separates legitimate transactions from illegitimate ones, so the attacker can instantly issue transactions for every key that he had cracked after the hard fork.
Our best option is to use strong algorithms form the start and switch fast if it shows signs of breaking.

For ECDSA this is the case. Note that ECDSA don't use hashes to create the public keys, it's just that Bitcoin uses hashes *of* the public keys as the addresses.
For RSA, I think the private and public key are generated together (you can't just generate one from the other). With ECDSA, the public key is generated *from* the private key.

You can selectively reveal chosen properties of your credentials with this system. Like date of issuing, or work title, or having access to a given service, or whatever. All that can be properties for one single ID. And no one would know more than what you tell them. They would only get a "yes" or "no" to "is property X true for the given credentials Y?".
And if you *want to*, you can also reveal your identity completely to build reputation.

Web-of-Trust can't work for global (or even national) secure certification of identity. Your vouching system will fail. Proof of identity can at best be done by having a number of independent trusted organizations vouch for it by signing your public key.

You seem to have figured it out pretty well. 
Each address represents a cryptographic keypair. Your wallet holds a number of private keys used to generate cryptographic signatures of your transactions. 
Deterministic wallet clients like Armory and Electrum uses seeds that all keypairs are generated from. You only need to back up the seed. Bitcoin-Qt however keeps a pool of 100 randomly generated unused keypairs. You need to back it up regularly to not lose keypairs. 
All wallet clients will take coins from multiple addresses/keypairs if required to be able to spend the full sum, as you mentioned. Change works as you mentioned, what's left of the claimed input transactions (you claim transactions individually, not necessarily everything an address holds at once) is sent back to one of your own addresses. It won't claim more input transactions than it actually needs, just as much as required to cover the sum to spend. 
Fees are optional. On the technical level, fees are what's left when you sum up the value of the inputs in a transaction and subtract the value of all the outputs. If the sums are identical then the fee is zero, but that transaction could be rejected by the miners. If the inputs are greater in total, the remainder is the fee. 
You might like Shamir's Secure Sharing Scheme, you can split up something like an Electrum seed in several pieces where several pieces is required to recover the seed. You could also additionally encrypt each share. 
Paper is much more reliable than USB memory sticks. Electrum has a 12 word seed. You can also use Qr codes to encode the keys. 
Electrum generates a "master public key" from your seed in a way that let you track how many Bitcoins you have on the addresses in the wallet without being able to spend them, since the MPK only can generate the addresses but not the private keys (yay ECDSA!). You need the seed to spend.

Do you even know how Bitcoin works? Do you know what the blockchain is?
All you have to do is to let them know which your Bitcoin addresses are, just like how you'd today register your car with the license plate number when you get a car insurance. You'd report a theft by pointing to the transaction where the coins where lost, like how you'd report when and where your car got lost.
Where did you even get the idea from that some special institution or central party is required? Creating anonymous unregistered addresses is trivial. Registering addresses with your insurance company is also trivial. No change is required anywhere.

Your idea of allowing somebody to destroy coins and then create coins on another address ALSO requires patches to the Bitcoin protocol.
There is no major difference there except in scale of the modification.
ZeroCoin lets you send coins to a custom address that essentially locks them up, and that address belongs to *nobody*.
Then later on you use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to show that you have send coins to that address, and then withdraw the same value in coins to a different address. Due to the way this is done you can not claim the coins twice, and it can not be traced to your deposit.

Bitcoins is one of those things who truly aren't like most of the others. Seriously, if you actaully believe in the tech and in that there's nothing that is better enough to replace it within a decade, then it's nearly certain to take several % of the market of companies like Paypal.
Do you know how much money Paypal moves around? Do you know how much money even middle-sized banks *stores*?
Now assume Bitcoin takes 0.5% of that. Just to do *that* it's going to have to grow by several thousand times from now!
What people are speculating in here isn't that people will need more handheld farming tools ("and then came the tractors") or whatever new thing that people just *might not need* or that *might not be preferred*.
Bitcoin has the momentum. The cryptographers, the actual experts on secure algorithms, says that Bitcoin holds up. It has properties that nothing else has. It offers something unique that people want.
The bet people here are making is that it will gain more adoption, that the security won't get cracked, that it won't be replaced by something significantly better, that it will remain advantages to the other options (such as regular bank accounts and currencies; like being able to send money wherever you want, with reasonable speed), and that the community will hold together (at least the developer community).

I2P is fairly easy to configure and use little enough resources to be able to have it run silently and automatically in the background on the majority of modern computers. If you have an Internet connection that doesn't have crazy caps,  you should let it run since it I2P routes traffic by default (maxes out by default on a few hundred kbps), which strengthens the anonymity for all it's users. 
You don't even have to think about it being there. It can update automatically and just work silently in the background. 
And once more people starts to use it (it's got show growth, but it's still growth) then more people will have a reason to actually actively use it, including it's plugins like Bote mail (serverless encrypted email). 
It's like phones. The first people got them because they liked the idea. The second wave got them because they knew somebody who had got them. Some got them because they knew more people would get them. And suddenly enough people had them for practically everybody to get it,  because by then you could already do what you needed with it. 
Same thing here, the number of things you can do with it is growing. Soon enough there will be a reason for quite a few people to use it regularly, and then even more people will find a user for it,  and so on. 
And it never hurts to let people know it exists.

Provably fair systems.
Such as something where the output is derived from the inputs of all the participants in a way that can't be gamed. For example, everybody sends in a checksum of a random number. When the time is out, you generate a checksum of that list of checksums. Then the participants reveal the numbers they generated their checksums from (this way they can't fake what number they actually provided). Then you make a checksum of the combined checksum and those checksums. This new value feeds a "lottery algorithm" that is public, where everybody can verify the output through doing exactly the same calculations themselves. And the output from that algorithm then decides the winners.
Due to how checksums works, this can't be gamed and it's provably fair.

I think some digital content distribution mechanism based on Tahoe-LAFS could be interesting. But you can't get rid of the problem that you can't really algorithmically prove that the end user got the key **and** that the file owner got the funds for it.
At best you could *attempt* to implement a smart contract where the transaction includes a payment to the file owner and the distribution service which only can be unlocked if the private key for that file is shared and if it's downloaded. But how on earth can the distribution service prove that they sent the key to the buyer? The buyer could be given parts of the encrypted file at a time and be asked to sign each part before getting the next, but at the end either part can decide to halt the process before it's completely done and pretend there was a network error and keep pretending that if asked to repeat it, in which case either the buyer gets an incomplete or undecryptable file or the seller and distribution network don't get their payment.

The way it's configured in I2P it actually does replicate the copy on every computer that access it, turning them into hosts as well. In other words, just like Freenet. You host copies of what you visit, and others can request it from you as well.

Note that cryptographic signatures using public and private keys are used to authenticate bitcoin transactions.
You can only spend bitcoins you have the right private key for, *and everybody with the same private key can spend it.*
Public keys (more accurately, cryptographic hashes of them) is the addresses, which is how you can prove that the bitcoins you are trying to spend belongs to you - it has previously been sent to your address, and you can create a valid signature with the same keypair.
You need to keep your private keys secret.

And don't forget that Bitcoin is global. It doesn't *have* to become the default currency in every single local market, it will work just fine even if just only some parts of Asia, Africa and Europe uses it.
China hasn't been able to kill off Tor inside their own borders yet. Why do you think they could kill Bitcoin? It's even easy to use anonymously. For as long as people will be able to use cash anonymously (such as in all of history), they can use Bitcoins that same way.

Why? The system could automatically create "countervotes" such that the result is exactly the same, but that you can't tell what's fake. So the result checks out, and the SMPC setup is the insurance of trust.
BTW, I suggested another way in another thread here. Let poll workers sign the encrypted votes with their official keys. The votes are published in encrypted form. If your vote is missing, you can prove with the signature that it's legit and was excluded for whatever reason, but it's impossible to figure out what the vote stands for since it's still encrypted.
@_date: 2013-08-26 00:51:34
What to compute?
Everybody puts in their transactions. Nobody can know which transactions came from whom, other than that they know their own. Out comes a signed Bitcoin transaction that includes them all in one. Either everything gets signed properly or it exits with an error. The protocol doesn't allow the generated transaction to be created in any other way than the correct way. All user specified outputs will be included, all user specified inputs will be included, no user can specify larger outputs than inputs (unless everybody agrees), etc...
You can try to migitate that some people would keep submitting bad inputs such that the final bitcoin transaction won't actually be valid through throwing in a Merkel hash tree for all the currently unspent transaction outputs (which by definition are the only valid inputs) with the addresses tied to them, such that bad inputs can be auto-rejected quickly, letting the scheme point out the malicious user (the one who gave invalid inputs). The list a Merkle hash tree would be generated for would be something like "[Address]-[transaction ID]-[amount of BTC]" for all possible valid inputs as described above, everybody would generate the same Merkle hash tree and give it to the Secure Multiparty Computation algorithm, and each user would have to specify which ones they use for their inputs (which *quickly* can be verified against the Merkle hash tree), and prove they have the private key for it.
Using Zerocoin for this would be doubly overkill.

You were talking about having value from something else. The only something else that matters over time is industrial use. And gold happens to be the most well known example, all the others have the same basic issues. Besides, gold has a special set of unique properties;
How much utility does gold have to you? Of all the inert, easily divisible and scarce things that are easy to verify authenticity of, how many do you have practical use for? 
Zero. 
Besides, Bitcoin can enforce things like m-of-n transactions, enabling extremely secure escrow, some already use it for virus detection by leaving small amounts unprotected and monitoring the addresses. I can prove I've spent scarce resources with those bits. Sure, that's not "isolated" from their part of the protocol, but besides salt, how many currencies have fundamentally had more than a few percent of their value based on their practical use?
Haven't the majority of currencies been fundamentally based on trust in that other people will accept it? Why do you even care about currency having secondary value when you still would lose 99% of your stored value of the currency fails? For what purpose do you think the secondary value is required? What is the purpose of it? What would it's impact be? 
And why don't you just start a company dealing with issuing colored coins that represent ownership in redeemable gold bars in a vault of yours if you think that is so important? Then you have something backed by gold (and by trust in your company) and secure provable tokens of ownership that are easy to transfer.

Though we will need a much higher standard for code review soon, and I would even like to see Bitcoin rewritten using formal develpment methods. Of course we shouldn't let Bitcoin get stung by featuritis and die by bloating. If there's too many options and features, people will be even more likely to use it wrong than they are today.
I don't think we should have too many altcoins with various testing features, because the risk is that they'll all just be considered as novelty coins and that even good developments there will be forgotten or ignored. We could have some altcoins dedicated to testing new features (and in the meanwhile we'll learn how to cleanly update the protocol on existing blockchains), and just a few that are stable alternatives to Bitcoin with different sets of features.

How do you recreate it without remembering a random string? If you use a random number generator, it won't generate the same private keys the next time. If you don't use one and don't enter a password from memory, then the private key must be guessable (not enough "unique" entropy to seed it with).
What method exactly do you recreate it with?
@_date: 2013-06-04 21:11:46
Yup, the next Armory release (it's not in the current version yet, right?) will have this already, and this is probably what I'd recommend to newbies.
The other tool I linked to in my other comment can be used for any kind of file, though. It takes an extra step to use compared to using the feature in Armory.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:05:27
Electrum uses 128 bits of entropy, which is very strong and will last for ages. Armory uses more (256 bits IIRC) and is probably not ever going to be bruteforced, no matter the effort.

More than one wallet is a good idea, yes. Use a paper wallet as your offline wallet. Using Electrum with it's 12 word seed written down is a good choice. 
Coinbase is decent, but isn't intended as a wallet service.
You can send your Bitcoins from your Coinbase wallet to your other wallets if you give them address to send it to. 
Lost Bitcoins will simply never be touched again. Thanks to the divisibility of Bitcoin, that doesn't matter. 
You need to use special commands to Bitcoin-Qt to make it give you the private key in plaintext. It is easier to install Electrum and send your coins between two normally. 
Using only one address is bad for your financial privacy. Using multiple addresses also makes it easier to track what's what.

Proof of stake is like burning "Bitcoin days" as a means of mining.

@_date: 2013-11-30 21:47:28
Yeah, basically.
You send money to the P2SH address and wait for that transaction to be confirmed. Once that one is confirmed, you have a temporary notarized wallet.
First 24 hours: Notary signature required to spend from P2SH address. Doublespend won't work as you can't get a doublespend transaction signed, thus the second transaction won't be valid.
After 24 hours: You are free to spend the coins as usually.
If merchants accept zero-confirmation payments with +1h left on the time window, they're secure against doublespends as the doublespend won't get a notary signature and *can't* be accepted by the network until after the first one already has been confirmed anyway.

You can't get below 30 seconds anyway in a decentralized network due to latency in routing and computing. There aren't all that many cases where about a minute is fine but 10 isn't relative to the total market. Considering the blockchain bloat as well due to multiplying the number of headers, it just isn't worth it.

The miners will work on the block they see first, so the first one solved has a greater chance of being included in the chain. There's a bit of random chance in proportion to the hashing power of the miners in each group due to the statistical behavior of proof-of-work.

6 confirmations is to make a blockchain fork (malicious or due to network latency) far too unlikely for anybody having to consider it a risk to screw up even massive transactions like buying a cruise ship.

@_date: 2013-12-25 12:20:14
First of all, there is instant verification of finding a valid key. Second, the actual encryption is less than fully random. OTP derives it's security from the ENCRYPTION KEY being FULLY random. Third, the keyspace is limited since each English word is estimated to only provide 1 bit of entropy each (while in OTP every individual bit each adds one bit of entropy). 
BIP38 really is better.

P2SH addresses are different from regular addresses. The transactions spending money from those addresses can ONLY use scripts that matches the hash of the address itself. Thus you can specify and enforce conditions like this.
I'm not sure if the scripts feature allows usage of the time variable this way right now, but otherwise it could be updated to do so.
The script would simply work like this:
If the current time is &lt;24h after the specified date, require a signature from key A and key B. If the current time is &gt;24 after, only a signature by A is required.

People often assume anyone talking about hypnosis believes in the mind washing type of hypnosis. The one supported by evidence is far weaker and relies on cooperation by the subject of hypnosis, and is really mostly a matter of believing in something so strongly that the brain alerts it's perception. And pain can actually be blocked by willpower (the brain as a neural network is fully capable of rewiring itself to react differently to stimulus), but it is hard and typically requires training.

Systems with authorative nodes like those I described are by definition not decentralized, because those nodes can disrupt/attack/kill the network, and the networks often don't work without them. Your quote doesn't disagree with that.
Decentralized means no central node, and does NOT imply hierarchial. Hierarchial systems are typically centralized unless when they only use random hierarchies with no authorative node for performance reasons. Decentralized only means there's no single authority, the end. It's a label for what it lacks, not for what it has.
Bitcoin has no central node = decentralized.
If you are saying it isn't because you think "distributed" is a better label, that's like denying the sun is round because it's yellow - but there are no conflict! It can be both!
"Distributed" imples nothing at all about any hierarchies, it's possible to create a network that is distributed but centralized, just see most botnets that use P2P communication. They are distributed as they usually don't have any particular static hierarchy in the network, and they distribute work among themselves, but the central node is the one who can issue new work and new commmands, the botnet nodes themselves don't have any authority. The owner can issue commands to this network to tell it to operate autonomously, he doesn't need to be online himself except for when he want to check the status or issue commands. And any node in the botnet can replace any other. This is what distributed means. If you take control over the owner's authorative node, you can control the whole network.
How old are the definitions you use? Where do they originally come from? I haven't seen them in use that way before.

Do you have it written down in full anywhere?
I'm going to write down my second version soon, based on a blockchain type system inspired by Zerocoin and the paper Distributed Anonymous Credentials (also from the Zerocoin folks).
At first it lets people register (see details below on that) and publish their public key, and a token is created for every published key. Then to vote you don't actually sign the vote (otherwise there could be profiling combined with datamining on Facebook, etc, to deanonymize them, if I know 3/4 of your vote I can also find out the last 4th part from your vote), instead you publish the different fractions of the vote together with zero-knowledge proofs that show that you control one of the registered keypairs AND that your vote fractions do not conflict and that the vote follows the rules - for example, you could score option A and B, and the ZKP would show you ONLY have published one fraction for A and one for B with your scores for each. The result still becomes the same, everything is public and verifiable (anybody can recount the votes), it's anonymous (I'm assuming voters also are encouraged to connect via Tor/I2P) and it can work with multiple types of voting.
We'll need to figure out a couple of schemes for creating vote fractions that accurately can represent different types of voting, such as ranking. I haven't yet figured out how to efficiently make sure you can detect conflicting fractions without "chaining" the proofs, but I'm sure that's solvable.
On registration: You could have one voting chain that can handle multiple concurrent running votes, or separate chains for every vote. For each vote, there would be some organization or group of them that manages it, you'd register with them to get your keypair signed, to register to the vote chain you need a signed keypair.

And today it's giving way to the metric system, slowly. Because it too is less useful. It might have some "simple" conversions methods, but metric is still easier.


And I think metric measurements are even easier than that. 1 liter, 1 deciliter, etc.. (And there's measurements that are multiples of those.) Also, when you roughly know the density of something and it's specified in volume on the box and wheight in the receipe, it's nice to know things such as that 1 liter = 1 kg for the density of water and most of these fluids.


Why reduce by 1/4? Because it was specified for 4 people, and you don't cook for 4? That happens.

Bitcoin transactions looks more like "take A coins from address 1 and transaction 1A, take B coins from address 2 and transaction 1B, take C coins from address 3 and transaction 1C, and send X coins to address 4 and Y coins to address 5".
With many inputs (one for each transaction you recieved that you now want to spend), the size becomes quite large. The blockchain is just a series of transactions, it doesn't update the number of how many coins you have. The miners simply verify if the transactions is valid or not through checking if the previous transactions you are claiming are unspent or not.


They could, but it would be computationally inefficient that way. The client would have to search ALMOST THE ENTIRE BLOCKCHAIN for EVERY transaction it verifies if it worked that way. But now it doesn't. Each transaction points to previous transactions to make the verification faster since you can search the blockchain for them faster.
The transaction fee is (A+B+C)-(X+Y) which can be written as "total inputs minus total outputs".

@_date: 2013-06-08 18:12:35
I love algorithms like zero-knowledge proofs. You may have heard about Zerocoin already, and it's based on those things.
You can prove things such as citizenship and not reveal anything other than the fact that you're a citizen (assuming you have a asymmetric cryptographic keypair signed by a goverment). You can prove that you have the data that was used to generate a certain checksum. With it's use in Zerocoin, you can prove that you have converted Bitcoins to Zerocoins in the past in order to anonymously withdraw Bitcoins.
And you reveal *nothing* other than the simple yes/no answer to the algorithmic question that was asked.
There are many other ways to use crypto to share data privately as well as getting anonymous access to things in an abuse-resistant way, etc...

Authenticating 1 TB with this scheme would require a massive amount of hash computations. With 1024 bits and 1 TB that's (8\*1024^4  / 1024)\*2-1 = **17 179 869 183 hashes**. Not to mention the storage space you need for the computed tags (a few hundred GB if you don't want to lose performance) and the bandwidth needed to compute it reasonably fast.
Do you understand what I mean by overhead? Even if they're relatively simple hashes, it's a ton of them.
And sure, you can use that first 1 TB as one time pads for a ton of authentication tags (1 TB / 1024 bits = 8 billion OTPs for tags) later on so you can reuse that pre-shared key for authenticating a ton of new messages, but you're not getting rid of the computational overhead.
Also, for messages larger than 1 TB you need to compute several tags for it. And each tag generated "spends" one authentication tag one time pad.
Also, I'm still convinced that it's more likely that there exists a cryptographically strong primitive of some sort that can be used for stream or block ciphers than that QKD can be implemented securely (as in MITM proof) in real life.
Edit: Let's say you dedicate 16 GB RAM for hash calculation. Then you need to go through the 1 TB of one time pad 512 times to calculate the result of these hash trees. Then you have just 512*1024 bits = 64 kB to compute the rest of the hash tree from.
You still have a ton of bandwidth issues. Going through 16 GB 512 times can't be fast. In the end you need to go through over 2 TB read/writes in your RAM (counting overhead), probably 3 TB or so, maybe even far more.

The entire point of "RSA OFU" is that you can create keypairs in a trusted manner where you can't know the private key. And obviously it needs more review from cryptographers.
Then we have zero-knowledge proofs. Fairly well known and have gotten their fair share of analysis. Don't know if the specific version they use is well reviewed, though.
Then we also have one-way accumulators (comparable to hashes, but work in a somwhat different way). Don't know how well reviewed they have been, but they seem to be secure.
All in all, it *does* need far more cryptoanalysis, but it isn't inherently a bad idea. It "just" needs some of it's assumptions verified.

51% attacks from pools aren't really very meaningful. If the purpose is to earn more on mining, they'd fail miserably as it would be detected and cause trust to fall = bitcoin prices would fall. Only attackers that could benefit from outspending all the miners on mining rigs while bitcoin prices fall would have any incentive to pull off that kind of attack.

I'm not moving the goalposts. While I realized that the storage space required wasn't that extreme, you were still wrong about 256 bits being enough.
And the computational overhead remains a real problem, and is actually A PART OF the overhead that I mentioned before?
QKD is redundant for as long as there exists secure cryptographic primitives like hashes, block ciphers or stream ciphers, in which case the far lower overhead would mean people would use THEM for authenticating the QKD generated one time pad instead of the one mentioned above - but then you might as well just ONLY use that to secure your communications.


HMAC already exists. AES-GCM is a cipher mode with authentication embedded. ECC signatures also work. They are all computationally faster than your suggested QKD authentication scheme.


Hours, unless you use a large overpowered machine with double i7 CPUs and 64 GB RAM or so, with OpenCL acceleration for the computation on 4 GPUs. Then you get it down to minutes.


I'm fine with that. It's matematically provable given our known laws of physics that +2^310 computations is impossible since there's a minimum possible amount of energy required for a bitflip in the temperature of the vacuum in space, and that many computations would require more energy than there exists in out universe. Then account for Grover's algorithm and quantum computers and we double it, so 2^620 computations then.
Even under P=NP, chances are we can create a cipher that can't be broken in under 2^620 operations, even if it's performance would suck relative to our modern ciphers.

You can already do that by simply encoding an URL as mentioned above: 


Scan that and your bitcoin app opens and will see the payment request, which your app will ask you to accept or deny.
If you don't lock the NFC chip, you (and anybody else who holds it!) can replace that string. I'm not sure how many times they can be reprogrammed before breaking, and it might be inconvenient to reprogram them before every payment (which you'd need anyway to set the sum).

A wire is too thin, or is under too much pressure which causes it to thin out. You use small amounts of electricity normally. Then you plug in something more powerful, and the wire heats up far too much.

Irrelevant. There's a reason for why big companies uses special hardware to generate enough bits of entropy, seeds a cryptographically secure RNG with that, AND THEN also uses a key derivation algorithm like PKDBF2 to generate the actual key. Your source to your seed sucks if you only use strings existing in the OS, any attacker who knows crypto and who are willing to spend an hour or so on cracking it will succeed. You are essentially using a crappy entropy source and then using a home-made RNG/key derivation algorithm based on that. And that's what you're doing when even people who use CSRNGs + key derivation algorithms get hacked due to using bad entropy sources.


So you only run it on the command line or so? Do you know it's still likely to be cached and end up in the swap file (don't remember what the Windows equivalent is called, but it has something just like it). Any attacker who gets access to your machine is likely capable of finding it and recovering your key.


So what? I can use "hello" and do SHA512 on that and it will look secure and random, but yet it will be weak.
(Also, I use KeePassX with a strong master password I remember in my head. I generate 20 character passwords with it for everything else (120 bits of entropy)).

Almost everything is verified using RSA keys. Quantum computers with enough qubits can crack those *fast*. So you'll just MITM the shit out of every connection you can find, and you can break into most remote control systems (SSH, various VPN:s, etc), and you can generate fake SSL certs, or even better just use the real ones and generate the real private key, and you can essentially walk right through almost all security measures that has an authentication step based on RSA crypto or other crypto based on factorization.
Consider the movie Swordfish.
You don't need to know the real password anymore, you just take all the public keys you find and crack the private keys, and use that to dig yourself through to whatever you want to get at by using those keys to authenticate yourself to new systems where you find more public keys, etc...
ECDSA is also vulnerable to quantum crypto, and that is what Bitcoin uses. McEliece is thought to be quantum resistant.

When you have bitcoins, they are "assigned" to you in the blockchain, and all you need to have to spend them is the private keys that belong to the public keys of yours which they are assigned to (using public/private key cryptography with ECDSA - the public key is your address).
Encrypting the keys with a password is a security measure. If you do, then you NEED the password to get the private keys.
The private keys is stored in the wallet.dat file with some extra data.

Typically you mix methods when cracking passwords. While "bruteforce" typically is the "dumbest" method where you try all possibilities, I consider generalized dictionary attacks to just be a smarter/more optimized version of bruteforce.
@_date: 2013-07-30 23:08:34
I think you've got something subtly wrong.
You don't just target one person when you bruteforce keypairs. ECDSA key generation is the heavy part in the process. Testing the checksums is the trivial part. So you check every key you generate against the list of all addresses in the blockchain that has coins.
And you simply feed the key generation with password cracking dictionaries. And a web crawling bot can look through forums for names they can tie to the addresses, which they can include when running dictionary attacks.
You should measure password strength in "entropy" (the information theory version). Anything below 64 bits (2^64 different possibilities) is trivial to break for any medium sized enterprise. 80 bits for massive server farms. AES uses either 128 bits or 256 bits for a very good reason which is called security margin.
I generate 20 character passwords with KeePassX which then gives 120 bits of entropy.
What you suggested doesn't have much more than 30-40 bits (guesstimation - and if that's a previously known phrase it drops to ~15 bits) and can be cracked by laptops.

Bitcoins are sent to addresses. Each address is linked to a private key. Electrum creates a list of private keys based on a single (very large) number. Numbers can also be represented as words (one, two, three, or hi, plane, hope - it's arbitary!). The addresses are then generated based on those keys. 
So if you write down the seed (that large number) that Electrum shows you in the form of words, you can access all coins sent to you later just by entering that seed again in Electrum.

Only if it's slower than good old modem speeds. If you've got a few tens of kbps and already have the blockchain synced (probably over a faster network), then it should work fine. (That's if you mine using P2Pool or solo where you need a "full node".)

They are cryptographic private keys. Each private key and it's corresponding public key form a pair. 
Together with the public key (that the addresses are based on) from the same pair it enables you to create a verifiable proof that you as the holder of the private key backs a given message.
That allows you to show in a secure and verifiable way how you want to spend your Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 11:55:56
It isn't really. The computational complexity of the mining algorithm would require a massive quantum computer to even run at all. It needs to hold the full block in memory to be able to calculate the header (Merkle tree hash) and to perform the SHA256 mining based on that. That's a few *million* qubits that needs to be in entanglement, and that quantum computer needs to be a full generic quantum computer (the quantum version of Turing complete). 
Currently we have one device who not everybody thinks is actually a quantum device, that NOT even is a generic quantum computer, that has *a whopping 500 qubits*. That's not nearly enough for anything meaningful.
Not to mention that the probability of a correct output for each round is MINIMAL, which means the number of rounds required to find a correct output (valid block) is HUGE (likely NOT LESS than the square root of the network difficulty measured in hashes required on average per block) - and that's considering that each round of quantum computing takes time to set up to run, since you have tons of qubits that needs to be entangled and configured, as compared to the transistors of an ASIC that you just send electric pulses through. The number of computational rounds for high end quantum computers are likely to be measured in "x rounds per minute".

if SHA256(SHA256(last block hash, timestamp, random number, Merkle tree hash of transactions) &lt;= target value, then you have a valid block.
The target value can be set such that 1/4 of all outputs will match it or such that 1 in 890486908359068306 will match it. That target sets the difficulty. You calculate the difficulty based on how fast blocks previously have been solved (every 2016 blocks it recalculates it). It is set such that with all the hashing power together in the network, a match will be found once every 10 minutes on average (if the whole network calculates 10 trillion hashes per minute, it would be set such that on average 10*10 trillion tested hashes is required to find a match).
That's the basics of the proof of work.
As I said, the chain with the greatest computational power wins, or in simpler terms the one which it is estimated to have required the greatest amount of computed SHA256 hashes to create.

Quantum based communcation still requires trusted and secure conventional communication channels for verification. Also, they require trusted quantum routing networks. And it's typically only used for key distribution for secret symmetric keys among two parties.
Also, you can't just "pass on" a quantum message you've read and still have it be verifiable.
In other words, it has massive overhead and is useless for our purposes where we need public cryptographic signatures on a shared legder.

Bitcoin is the only protocol that let you send numbered tokens securely across the globe in minutes without relying on any servers, in an easily verifiable way. It is even programmable tokens, the first of it's kind. It enables smart contracts, devices who securely knows who owns them, escrows who can't steal the money, m-of-n transactions where it is absolutely enforced that a certain number of people needs to sign the transaction before it hits through, etc... 
Is that not inherent value to you,  then? 
All those things you mentioned can be replaced by something else for the same purposes.

Freicoin? It's simply inflationary by design.
You can't really make a decentralized currency that is both fully self adjusting and immune to being gamed. There's no trusted or verifiable data input sources for the system to use, so it can never know what's the ideal way to respond to real-world events. It can't tell what a sell-off is triggered by, or if some money was moved between two people or between two accounts belonging to the same person. It can't accurately judge the valuation of the digital currency vs physical goods or services. It can't accurately judge if or by how much parts or all of the economy is growing or going down, or why.
As I said, with the goals you have, cryptocurrencies simply aren't for you.

Some dedicated hardware with backups could help. It would have to be easy and secure to work well. And to prevent armed robberies happening all the time (demanding the password at gunpoint), it would only have the private keys for a few of your coins it at any given time with the rest of the keys locked up, *or* with extra strong passwords for most coins, and you'd only memorize a password that covers a small amount of bitcoins, keeping the other passwords written down somewhere safe.

Then tell me, how does it work?
Your assumptions about linear probability is only valid if there's a fixed set of outcomes (in this case, SHA256 values) that are possible outcomes, AND you run through THE ENTIRE set, AND you never repeat any number twice.
In this case, you run through A PART of the set, WITH a certain probability of repeating a number (even if low, since each number is generated randomly).




There's the proof right there. Every block must have a SHA256 checksum that has a value lower than a given 256 bit value. SHA256 checksums are essentially random since they are unpredictable, you can only know the SHA256 value of a piece of data by calculating it (there's no "shortcut" to findign out the value). There's no known bias in SHA256 values.
So there is literally a certain % chance for every single SHA256 value to be a match, which is 2^256/maximum_target. The maximum target variable can look like this in HEX encoding: 0x00000000000404CB000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Since you need to match the first part, 00000000000404CB, this value gives you a probability of about one in 16^11 for the 0's, then 1/4 for that 4, another 1/16 for that 0, another 1/4, then 12/16 and then 11/16, which in total is 1/(16^11 \* 4\*16\*4\*12/16\*11/16) = 4.30632\*10^16 or 1/2.32217\*10^15.
 (lol, the guy mistyped the year)








You can calculate an exact probability for each hash to be a match from the difficulty number.
If your assumption about linear probability was correct, that means that if you flipped a coin twice, you'd have a 100% probability of having both a heads and a tails instead of just 75%.
Edit: Oh, look, the work has been made easy for us: The current probability of a given hash to match;

Because slower.
It could surely work for each client to only hold like 200 MB of those multiple GBs (just a few hundred nodes on average could ensure the entire blockchain is available) and ask others about it when needed, but the clients also still need to be able to verify the entire blockchain somehow OR trust some central server.
**Maybe** (my suggestion here) a client could download the entire blockchain just once, verify it and then just keep a list of the block hashes rather than the entire blocks (up to 1 MB per block). So when you ask the network you know you got the right block again (thanks to the hash), and since you only need the hash of the last verified block to verify the new blocks following it you can look at fresh broadcasted blocks and verify them, and then just keep their hashes as well and dump the rest of those blocks. You could specify just a specific set of addresses to keep track of the balance for (your own addresses).

The only way to solve it is through creating a tamper proof systems where the outside appearance of a copy can not fool humans to believe it is real.
I seriously doubt that can be achieved, considering that the chances are nearly 0 that the manufacturing methods can not be imitated so closely that any differences are undetectable by humans without tools.
You are limited both by human perception (you rarely need a perfect copy, just take a look at ordinary counterfeiting) and by the ease of reverse engineering manufacturing methods.
Seriously, stopping counterfeiting is pretty damn hard. It's a billion times worse when most people who need to trust the item in question don't even know how to verify it.

Well, everything builds on everything. Proof of work that builds on crypto algorithms like hashes that builds on old very simple checksum algorithms + modern crypto theory based on computational complexity and all that. SHA256 is based on lots of old theory. So is ECDSA. Every step adds something of value.
Bitcoin is one of those steps that adds more value in total than most other steps since it provides something that is directly useful for so many people. Before it, most *average* people had very little use for modern crypto (a whole lot of them wouldn't actually mind much going back to 1950's style banking, etc). Of course all that crypto is great and very useful, but then you have to consider the audience/user base too. It's there where you measure the impact.

 &lt;- That's what it can do (today)
You'll need to be a programmer to understand most of it.
One of the more useful things: m-of-n transactions. Which means that the buyer can create a not-yet-valid transaction where 2 out of 3 has to sign it to validate it, in where you're one of those 3, the seller are another and an escrow you both trust are the 3rd. If both the buyer and seller agrees and validates it, it's done. If the buyer changes his mind (damaged goods?), he can tell the escrow, and if both he and the escrow agrees then it's invalidated (the seller don't get the money). If the escrow sides with the seller, the escrow and the seller sign the transaction and the seller gets the money.
@_date: 2013-06-20 18:48:31
What about the rare case where the money "gets lost in transit" (happens occasionally, sometimes it's "just" delayed by weeks - something you also wouldn't be able to verify) and both banks backs up the tales of their respective clients?

"If we get rid of goverment, no new goverment will be able to arise, and nobody will ever be able to exploit anybody else anymore on a large scale."


Go ahead and test it in practice if you want, I won't stop you. But you don't get to claim it's better without having proof of it.


You made the first statement. I responded to it. My point is what I've already stated, let's not switch until we know what's better. Feel free to try it on your own, though.


No I don't. There is no equivalence. You might seem to think it's similiar, but my logic is essentially "you can't say X is better than Y without proof", and the rest is derived from that ("switching to X without knowing if it's better is not a bright idea", "If A is bad, and B is unknown, then "A &lt; B" is unknown, so you can't claim "B is certainly better than A").
Again - your claim is more or less "what we have today is bad". And I would mostly agree. But you're wrong when you claim you know for sure that your one very specific suggested solution certainly is better, simply because you have no proof of it. If all it takes to claim that your suggestion is better than the current status quo is to prove that the status quo is bad, then I can prove that cancer is better than a bruise, because a bruise is bad. And using your logic, *unmodified*, I could defend *any* other potential solution. That's the kind of logic you applied.
So again, please come back when you have tested your idea and have some kind of proof. Until then, you don't actually know if it's better.

I didn't even say it would have to be a new goverment, it can be anything like guerillas that would take power in many areas. Or new dictatorships would simply form where they'd attack small groups one at a time to grow larger and larger over time. Without any kind of goverment or leadership, how will anybody fight back in a coordinated way against a group of people trying to take power?




It seems like people are trying to find land that they can create a new country on. Seems like a good start if anybody's going to try to do it.




I don't think I said it *is* worse (absolute statement), what I *think* is that it *probably* is worse.




What a bright way to respond without proving anything. Not that different from a conversation like this: "1+1 = 2" "that's like saying yellow is red" "nope, not at all" "you're such a baby!"






Induction alone is not a solid base for science. It takes much more than that to prove anything.
By the way, induction can also be used to conclude that the only thing that will happen over time is that the type of goverment reverted to will be different over time, or that it eventually gets stronger (you can take a look at dictatorships that took more power as a result of riots), etc... Also, one can also conclude that after that "ultimate liberalization", there will be an "ultimate dictatorship" taking power.
There is simply too many unknown variables.

Whoever said that, and meant it *absolutely* and that the opposite can't happen, is an idiot. The economy can not and will not grow forever. Physics itself simply don't make it possible - too much of whatever activity too fast and everything melts - it's not like we can have a billion billion people running around like crazy and working at such a high speed that you can feel the ground moving from the activity. At that point, when the economy is neither growing or shrinking, Bitcoin will neither be inflationary or deflationary if it's market size stays constant.
People who believe that the economy will grow forever are insane. In the same way, Bitcoin can't grow forever.
Bitcoins is simply deflationary relative to a growing economy. The economy is still growing, so it is deflationary now (for as long as more people in the economy adopts it).

Let's say Bitcoin find it's niche market and stabilizes. Then it will grow roughly at the same pace as the rest of the market. It's deflation % will roughly match the inflation %.
So what happens then? Will people stop buying things?
Nope. Doesn't tech drop in price faster in percent per year than the inflation alters the value of the regular currency in percent per year (~2x the performance for the same price per 3 year period)? And yet people buy. Who is waiting for $50 harddrives that can store 10 TB each? Nobody. People simply buy what they need. Deflation will simply encourage people to think a bit more before they buy.

It's not that it guarantees economic stability, but if you compare with gold then it has a relatively stable value as new gold has been mined progressively.
Then take a look at prices on collector's items, which can jump up and down wildly since almost all of them typically are bought instantly on release, and where they can be randomly dumped on the market (sometimes for fixed price, sometimes on auction) in varying quantities, at random points in time.
When it's distributed slowly over time, then there's a greater chance it will be spread more evenly to more people, and so the *aggregate* actions of all these people will be less "volatile".

Yes, at least if you use Linux on the offline computer to protect yourself against viruses infecting the USB stick. If you feel paranoid, then double check the transaction before signing it, maybe with a second online computer, just to see it's really going to send the coins to where you wanted to send them. 
The wallet.dat file holds the seed, any imported addresses and a bit metadata. If you haven't imported any addresses, all you need is the seed. 
Edit: look up Electrum's Master Public Key to make the process easier on the online computer, (requires that your coins is sitting on addresses Electrum generated).

A tiny key. Those 256 bits can at best select one of 2^64 hashes for 4 rounds, and then you get a tag at about 60 bits, and 512 bits of authenticated data. And no XOR tag, so then you have 512 bits for use as a new key. You've got to run an absurd amount of rounds of this protocol!
And depending on the timeframe between sending the authentication tag and verification of it, an attacker *might* just have a chance of successfully forging a tag for his own OTP (a 2^64 tag can be forged in 2^60 operations, and this tag will be somewhat smaller than that).


Optimized SHA256 runs at just a few dozen perations PER BYTE, even for massive file sizes. You can implement hash authentication schemes that can finish nearly as fast as your harddrive can send bytes to your CPU (plus some milliseconds).
Your scheme on the other hand requires tons of read/writes between RAM and the hard drive, at least 2 TB worth, and a massive amount of computations.

Either you peg to currencies, or you peg to goods (*via* currencies). I think there should be methods already to automatically track the value in regular currencies of a certain "basket of goods" (this is a common method to track inflation), so that you then can peg your prices to that, and then compute the price based on the value of that basket in regular currencies and Bitcoin's price in those same currencies.
So if the dollar itself goes up and down you aren't affected, so you are then really only using it for comparisons.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:23:54
128 was chosen because it's an even number of bits  (simply 2^7, easy for computers to work with efficiently) and out of range from bruteforce, and 256 (2^8 bits) is for when you *really* want it to be out of range from bruteforce.
Since 80 is assumed to be the upper range of what's crackable today, I'd say 103 bits combines with the scrypt that the brainwallet site uses is perfectly fine. An attacker won't realistically find more than a tiny fraction of those brainwallets within centuries.

But he shouldn't be able to know that. Knowing there's no repetitions reduces the required work
@_date: 2013-08-18 22:08:17
Algorithms like SHA256 is a bit too complex to be crackable in a reasonable amount of time even on a a quantum computer. Remember that there's a time limit as well on how fast it must find an answer, you only have up to 10 minutes! Considering that you WILL have to reorder inputs and test that with every permutation of a 4 byte nonce, and make sure that the two-rounds-of-SHA256 output is lower than a certain value, it's not entirely certain that even a massive quantum computer can pull that off. Ever.
You should remember that quantum computers works with probabilities, and more complex algorithms decrease the probability of a correct output.
ECDSA is weak to quantum computers, though, but we have options like McEliece and NTRU. We will likely have time to switch.

Bitcoin will become smoother to use over time. The payments API that is coming will also make things easier. 
Inflation isn't sustainable, there's your problem right there. A society built around constant growth and trading and lending will not last forever. It just can not be stable enough as time goes and crisis after crisis pops up. People will spend even though the money is deflationary. People are spending Bitcoins right now. You probably heard of that Norwegian guy - he didn't wait to get even more, he sold off those coins right away and just bought what he needed. 
Plenty exchanges are already following the current money regulation laws. Most of the big ones does. There are actually serious people running most of these services.

You don't seem to understand what "centralized" and "authority" really means.
Yes, there is this one single protocol you MUST follow, and a network that enforces it.
But it can be changed, if the whole network agrees.
And everybody and anybody in the network can be replaced, and nothing would change.
At best you could say the central authority is a virtual one, since as somebody else also said the Bitcoin protocol is a special case of a Secure Multiparty Computation system, a type of protocol which lets a group create a cryptographically secure shared Virtual Machine that can follow arbitary agreed upon instructions.

We'd need at least a separate Mars blockchain. And that would have to be a separate currency (like Marscoin). Then we could have exchanges between Earth and Mars, and the wallet software for both could absolutely be used on both planets, but each of them could only have it's miners on one of the planets (now I'm wondering how we protect the Mars blockchain from an Earth-originating 51% attack). Transactions with coins belonging to the other blockchain would be slow.

I may have mixed up some terms.
For copyleft licenses, everybody who has access to the binaries must be given access to the souce code on request by the person who "conveyed" the binaries to them (if they didn't modify it, it's fine to refer to the original source if they also have it available).
For permissive licenses, it isn't required that source code is redistributed along with the binaries.
But in any case, it makes no sense at all to call something open source when *nobody* except the developer has access to the source code.
And FYI: Affero GPL requires that end users of services you run on your service to have access to the source code of that specific version of the code you run, including any modifications.

Wasn't it clear through context what I meant? You seem to be reading my comments all backwards.
I wasn't talking about SHA256 when I mentioned the possibility of a hash och cipher that can't be broken in under 2^620 operations.
Since nobody has been able to prove anything about the minimum required number of operations for any complex cipher, there's no way to know for sure, but I would not be surprised if preimage resistance for Keccak or Skein with 1024 bits is at above 2^100 minimum operations. I have no idea how slow a 2^620 operation resistant hash or block cipher would be, but I am quite certain that even for 1 TB data it would be faster than your suggested authentication scheme.
I'm making sense, you're just not understanding it. If you disagree, then write down everything you assume about what I mean on a paper, burn it, forget it, and then read my comments again.

Actual quantum crypto is in 99% of all cases quantum *key exchange* followed by classical encryption. The rest 1% is equally useless.
All quantum crypto methods require an uninterrupted path between the two parties for the entangled particles to travel. Also, even with quantum crypto you need to have some kind of pre shared secret or other way of making sure you *really* know who you're talking to, to avoid MITM.




Yes it is, because what you quoted there isn't quantum computation. It's an entirely different type of quantum effect. And it has implementation requirements that makes it 100% worthless over the internet. And it's beyond meaningless for P2P networks in general (no requirement to authenticate most peers).

He probably won't, at least for a few decades. If he will, I doubt he'll go by his old nickname. What I think is that IF he thinks Bitcoin is going in the wrong direction for too long, he might just start an altcoin that works the way he think it should be working, and he might just partially start over and make some major changes in how it works, after learning more about which design decisions were good and which were bad in Bitcoin. But he will likely let it gain ground on merit alone, rather than using his own status to push for it.

Which means that your assumptions is inherently flawed.
If somebody has a list of thousands of leaked SSNs with names, how hard do you think it is to test that?
10 alphanumeric characters with an occasional special character plus one out of the name+SSN combinations from the list = around 70 bits of entropy. 80 bits is plausibly crackable.
If many people would use the scheme you suggest, then such a bruteforce attack would be financially viable.
And that's even assuming that optimizations like trying keyboard patterns first as well as trying names of people who's names can be found on Bitcoin forums first. Which on it's own can give far more than a thousandfold speedup in cracking.

1.2 * 10^77 / 7.5 * 10^18 is more like 10^(77-18) which is 10^59 as scrubadub said. Because you have a number followed by 77 zeroes divided by one followed by 18 zeroes, so just as in 1000/10 taking away one zero from three ( 10^3 / 10^1 = 10^2 just like 10^3-1 ), you take 18 from 77 which leaves 59.
So that's a number followed by 59 zeroes. 9 zeroes in a billion, so that is more than a billion billion billion billion billion billion earths.

@_date: 2013-10-07 18:44:39
1: There's a limit to how many transactions the network can handle (though the developers are working on scalability) + miners can refuse to include transactions without fees.
2: I don't understand the point of your question. People will simply include a reasonable transaction fee on the level that most others are using to make sure it's likely to get included quickly. Higher transaction fee will give miners greater incentive to include it quickly.
3: That's a "fork", and the miners will start working on a new block based on the first of those that it sees. Miners that worked on the other block will give it up once they see that the other fork has *two* blocks rather than just one in it's fork (the chain with the greatest amount of computing power behind it wins, so longer forks typically win).
Note that the point of hashing is to *find a pattern*, not a specific key. In the block they created, they'll include the transactions they verified AND also a "minting transaction" to themselves that creates as much coins as the protocol allows (currently 25) and the transaction fees to their own address. Note that addresses are based on public keys. All miners will mine based on their own keypairs, where they keep their private keys secret.
Swapping out the address of the miner invalidates the hash of the block, forcing the attacker to repeat the same amount of work, which he likely will not succeed with before the network has moved on to a new block based on that block. Also, it's still unlikely anybody would start hashing based on the modified block he made *if* he'd succeed to make on in time since it would still have shown up later on.

Yes, that would absolutely work. Include a hash of the description of contents that's also signed, and it's much more clear about what's delivered in turn for the money. Though with the current Bitcoin design that means the seller would have to send back some amount of bitcoins in order to include the message (could be just one satoshi, but would still require a transaction fee).

1: Absolutely not. It's incredibly guessable, far more so when your method is known. People do all kinds of stupid assumptions about what "random" actually means and what can be guessed and not. Stop assuming and learn how entropy *actually* works. You need plenty of words that NOT are systematically chosen in any way, you need actual unpredictable randomness like dice, a good PRNG on a secure computer, two hundred coinflips or whatever.
Entropy is measured by how many possible inputs there are, assuming the distribution is entirely even. Which it almost never is when humans creates the input.
2: Your choice. I'd go for ~10.
3: Nein. Only 44 bits of entropy assuming nobody knew about that one specifically, but you need over 100 bits of entropy. Try Diceware with about 10 words:

Something that used the "superpeer concept" to speed up the network when it comes to transactions and spreading around the latest solved block and getting new peers up and running faster. Something where the calculations aren't just mostly useless SHA256 calulations, but something that actually is useful (consider folding as an example). And something that don't actually need as much computing power (proof-of-stake is one interesting concept). Something that can avoid the 51% attack.

It's also a protocol in development, and protocol updates/changes require consensus to take force (see the resolution of the 0.7 vs 0.8 fork, consensus to switch back until the cause was resolved was created among the miners).

All algorithmic decentralized consensus systems with a single global accepted state (the blockchain in our case) really needs some kind of algorithmically verifiable scarcity based votes to make sure spoofing fake nodes is far too hard. We use proof of work, PPcoin uses proof of stake. 
Whenever "real-life resources" makes it easier to gain more of that which is scarce in order to gain more votes for yourself, this situation appears. 
For proof of stake, hoarding is incentivized far more than in "normal" supply-capped coins and the risk of 51% attacks are far more serious, especially in the first few years of those altcoins. Also, it is far harder to outspend an attacker in proof of stake systems, as there is nothing to buy that can effectively fight him (Bitcoin miners can buy more ASICs). 
"CPU bound" proof of work is pointless (see the scrypt ASIC) and is also vulnerable to botnets.

For that sum, first make sure your encryption password is strong. Try Diceware with 8-9 words. DO NOT EVER LOSE YOUR PASSWORD! Then back it up in multiple physical locations (3+). You might want to use Electrum with it's 12 word seed and split that up using Shamir's Secure Sharing Scheme, storing those pieces at different secure places. 
You should use Linux when spending, it's safer that way. You probably want to look up Electrum's dual offline/online setup with the Master Public Key. 
If you cash out half or so, you won't regret anything no matter if it goes up or down in value in the future.

Can it compute two rounds of SHA256 in that 3-SAT process?
And even then you need to get either a *certain* "nope, no match" or a correct nonce and timestamp as output (so you can send it new Merkle tree hashes fast enough) at a much faster rate than twice per second just to be competitive with a 500 GH/s miner.

They wouldn't convert all of it! And also, once a significant amount of them have it and know how to use it, it will be a lot easier to use it. Even if only one in 50 takes it, that's still often at least one store in walking range (depending on the area).

For low amounts, it's possible to simply ban those who try doublespends against you so they can't come back and do it later. For large amounts, you might want payment in advance and wait for it to confirm. For medium sized payments, it really depends on your type of business. If you know the person, you might now have to wait for confirmation. If it's somebody unknown, you have to figure something out that fits you. There's things like "green addresses", where you pay via trusted companies like Bitpay (it's up to the seller to decide which he considers "green"). And you can ask for an ID card, so a doublespend attempt could be reported as fraud.

The closest option we have for that is SCIPR: 
It uses zero-knowledge proofs to show that you have performed a given computation.
HOWEVER, this is nowhere close to something that is useful for mining yet. It's absurdly slow compared to SHA256-proof-of-work, and chances are that whatever you decide to use for mining, somebody could find a computational shortcut to creating an output that would be approved but that yet be entirely useless in real life. The benefit of SHA256 is that we already know how fast it can be done, there's really no algorithmic shortcuts for it, and it's simply well known and predictable. There's a ton of requirements for what alternative proof-of-work systems must be able to do, and so far we don't know a practical method for solving "general" problems as proof-of-work.
Not to mention that zero-knowledge based mining would have absurd computational overhead, making it far more efficient to just run it as normal in normal datacenters.
Also, there's the risk of running out of useful problems in the chosen area as well. And how exactly would work to be computed be distributed? How would you make sure it's not distributed in advance to certain people? That's why Bitcoin always has the current mining being based on the last block, so it "dynamically" creates now work to perform.

Don't worry much though, SHA256 is unlikely to be broken. But beware of overly static firmware, it can still be rendered useless if it can't handle the protocol updates. But it should be able to adapt to anything where mining is based on SHA256 and matching a given pattern in the output.

Well, ECDSA can actually be cracked in 2^(keylength/2) number of operations (256 bit keys can be cracked in 2^128 operations). It's simply due to how it's math works. And quantum computers can break it.

How? In public? That would violate the purpose of the system (everybody now have the key). By having the user sign the private key? The user can refuse to do so, so the payment would never be validated.
Edit: Maybe by encrypting the key to a public key of the user, plus a zero-knowledge proof that the message is encrypted properly to his key and contains the key, and message plus proof is required to be published. That would probably be one large ZK proof, and Bitcoin would need to support ZKP in scripts.

So which ones will it be? Nobody can know. When the mouse was invented, they didn't know it would be used for gaming and web browsing. They just wanted a simple pointer.

Lacking certificates creates absolutely NO alerts in Windows. And how can I possibly trust the certificate signing model? Who sets the rules for who gets a signature? How can I be sure no CA:s have been hacked?
The original assertion had nothing to do with signatures within Windows, but rather any official tool to check PGP/GPG signatures. There are official algorithms, and then there's tools that use them.

All key generation is either done with *cryptographically* good PRNGs or with things like atom decay (truly random) or it is crap (well, making up your own [Jabberwocky]( would likely be secure too). End of story. 
Your wallet file is as good as *unencrypted*. Secure key generation is *hard*.
Also, do you store that code for key generation anywhere? It might be in some cache you don't know about (how do you know it's not on the "swap file"?). It might be recoverable by something like Recuva. Chances are that malware can get to it like anybody else. Chances are that if the device is stolen, the theif can recover the key and steal the coins. Probably in less than an hour.

Not really.
There are multiple properties that the proof-of-work algorithm needs to meet. Predictable amount of work required per round, predictable amount of time taken per round, being trivial to verify, having an absolute way of telling when it's solved, being able to specify difficulty precisely, being able to specify what the problem is easily, and the precise work input to process should not be known in advance, etc... Checksums fits all these and makes the mining as fair as possible.
Other options are *possible*, but harder and introduces tons of problems.

The recipient address could be signed with the official address, and there could be a transaction with a message from both of them that says "I'm linked to the other address X". This would prove that they belong together.
(This could require a password to decrypt, for increased privacy. The buyer gets the password before he sends the money to the recipient address. He can share it in the case of a conflict about the transaction.)
So you send to the unique address, and can prove that you paid to the real business.

Better way! 
Use Electrum on both computers. Generate a wallet seed on the offline computer (and using Ubuntu is a good choice). Use a USB stick to give the generated Master Public Key to the online computer - now it can see how many coins you have, and it can also generate unsigned transactions! Now, when you want to spend coins, you let the online computer generate an unsigned transaction, put that on the USB, and let the offline computer sign it, then you pass it back on to the online computer and let the online one publish the signed transaction. 
Done! And your private key never left the offline computer! 
Note, don't forget to back uo the Electrum wallet!

What security token doesn't lock up after entering the wrong PIN too many times?
By the way, people have gotten their fingers *cut off* in order for thieves to be able to steal their cars (there's some car models with biometric locks). Some would probably not doubt to cut the entire hand off.
I know what I would prefer to lose.
Also, with biometrics you ALWAYS have to trust the scanner.
Things like TPM chips (when not used for things like shitty DRM) could be useful here. There's plenty of ways you potentially could make it nearly impossible to steal the private keys. In the end we'll have to figure out a number of different ways to protect the keys and make sure that average people can use them.
It's possible that many people will have to trust a bank-like entity, but then at least they will have a greater choice in who to trust and how much.
It's possible to have multiple physical tokens as a backup. You don't need to only have one single irreplaceable master key to everything.
Edit:  - and note that this is old (1998), which you can tell on the fact that he said fingerprint scanners are hard to fool. It's been trivial for ages, and it was in about 2000 that that security researchers started to demonstrate how crappy they are.

The problem is that you claim it's more secure, but it *isn't*. Making people believe something is more secure than it actually is WILL lead to users making bad decisions!
Your methods of spam filtering is simply ineffective. It's too cheap to mimic real user up until you start spamming, it's too profitable to do so, and it's too hard to automatically detect and filter all spam, and too many users make bad decisions and fall for scams.


Uhm, yes I do. Either you mean that it is 100% impossible to contact users without them first sending a friend request to you, or you are deluded when you think your system can stop spam.
And actually, there's even more ways to get spam into the network. You know the spammers are real people too, right? Now, let's consider that the spammers introduce fake profiles into the network themselves through adding them as friends, and then asking their own friends to add those, and then using *those* profiles to introduce MORE new fake profiles, and so on, and then work yourself outwards and add as many people as possible as friends, and THEN start spamming. And even THIS is profitable enough, and how on earth would you detect and filter this out?


This is just far too easy. You have *NO* clue how easy and profitable social engineering is. Actually, plain karmawhoring on Reddit is the PERFECT example of why the above is a miserable failure when it comes to spam filtering methods, because it is incredibly easy to gather new friends and an exponential rate with the above method, and then posting popular memes to earn tips.


This is equally bad. A very significant percentage of people WILL add random strangers that claim to be women.


Yes they can. Because spam is too profitable.


Nope. It's too profitable to fake being a legitimate user until you have a few hundred friends, and then starting to spam.

The majority of the users vote through choosing the clients with the features they want. Clients incompatible with those major ones dies out since we NEED to have ONE single global blockchain that all clients agree upon in order to agree on who has what coins. 
The large miners and companies like Bitpay and Mt Gox and other large exchanges and businesses have larger impact than most other users, and lots of people follow their votes in order to not be incompatible with them. 
Changes that causes incompatibility with other clients or other software versions is typically always announced in advance together with a suggested starting date so all developers have time to add support for the changes before they are activated.

Though yes, a reminder could be good if you're the forgetful type. But you should note that ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING that can help you to recreate the password/seed could be used by others as well if they can figure out what it means, so make sure it's something ONLY you can understand.
If anything, my recommendation is that you use something like a strange poem in the style of Jabberwocky as the password/seed, and that the reminder (your tattoo idea) would only hold some keywords and hint at the theme of the poem.

All they need is the address, since the addresses is based on public key cryptography. Your private key can be encrypted with every algorithm known to man and it will still work. 
You just need to be able to decrypt the private key to spend the Bitcoins yourself. 
Blockchain.info can both do sweep (move all coins in the address to another address in a wallet there, then forget the sweeped key) and import (store private key in the wallet, don't move the coins). 
In both cases you'll be able to move all tve coins on tbe address to Coinbase.

My node only needs to look at the blocks and transactions ypur node passes on. Is a transaction invalid? Does a block break the rules? Then my node rejects it. The rules are very strict. The amount of coins you get to mine in a block is decided by what number the block has in the chain, and every block must be based off one block one step back the chain. All transactions must refer to previous valid transactions. Any violation will be detected. A valid transaction can't refer to a non-existing coin or block. A block can't have more coins mined than allowed. A block with invalid transactions is rejected.

Fairly secure? It's still not comparable to the very well established protocols like OTR. Even if the author somehow managed to make it decent by accident, it can become crap again (see the previous Decryptocat link again, he switched from a crappy cipher to a good one to a crappy one to a worse one).

I don't see any evidence there for price following mining, rather the opposite. Price could fall to zero if nobody wants the coins, because not even the miners would be able to sell them since nobody is buying.

And when it is all sold? When the trades volume falls to zero and only a few miners are willing to buy, how much sense does it make to talk about what price point it is at? 
Arbitrage only works if there's variation in supply and demand across markets. There wouldn't be any in this case after a week or so. Game theory, you know. Trading volume will hit zero. 
The price is set on the markets. My point is that for as long as the supply side isn't dominated by the miners, they won't be the ones to set the prices. And most miners actually sold off early. 
If you think Bitcoin is going to work, you're already assuming it will work with a fixed total supply, right? If miners stop selling, then the available supply on the market will just simply be lower than the total.

Sure, but you can only verify that they belong toegether if you have the seed. But the seed has to be kept secret. And otherwise it's just a list of addresses as far as any outsider knows.
Also, if the list is published in advance in an unencrypted form, that makes it pretty meaningless as everybody instantly will know who is the recipient of the payments. Though checksums of the addresses could be published, google "commitment schemes". So the buyer can compute the checksum of the address and compare to the list.

Won't the pricing be pretty irrational rather than just proportional to how many % of the bonds are from the actual economic growth, due to the strange human psychology?

Addresses are based on ECDSA asymmetric cryptographic keypairs.
There's a private (and secret!) key that is 256 bits long, and a public key that is derived from it. The private key can NOT be derived from the public key.
Transactions are validated by using the private key to digitally sign the transaction data, and the public key is used to verify that the transaction is valid. For a public key, ONLY the private key from THAT keypair can be used to create a digital signature that validates as signed by that public key's private key.
Or in other words, if you give somebody your public key and you keep the private key secret, and you sign a document and give the signed document to them, they can verify that ONLY YOU could have signed the document AND that the document has NOT been changed. This is one of the major parts that makes Bitcoin transactions secure.
When you generate an address, you first generate a private key, generate the public key, and then share a thing called a checksum of the public key as the address. You must keep your private keys safe, and if you lose them then you can't spend your coins.
Since 256 bits have an EXTREMELY HIGH number of possible combinations, it is PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE to figure out what another person's private key is, even if you try to guess an extremely large amount of times. (Though there's an exception - if somebody used a bad key generator, THEN it is easy to guess the private key. Good key generators use good sources of randomness to make it unguessable.)

It does help somewhat, but is not the only security measure you should rely on. It simply adds to the work the attacker has to perform.
If the attacker previously could go through over [300 billion passwords per second]( then key stretching by 100 000 rounds (which would take somewhere below a second to compute on most laptops) would cut that down to 3.48 million per second.
Thereby it also multiplies the average time taken to crack a given password by 100 000x times.
Combined with a strong password it will do you good.

If you pick "sweep", then all coins is moved away from it to the blockchain.info wallet. If you pick import, then it's one of the addresses and change MIGHT be sent to it. It's not a problem if you remember the password and ID for that online wallet.
If you use Mycelium on your phone to import it, then change WILL be sent to it, and I believe the same is true for Electrum too on computers.
Change addresses are simply an address of your own that USUALLY is a different one than the "source address", that any excess coins are sent to when you spend coins.
Think of bitcoin transactions as a bunch of gold bars. I have 1 in an address and send you 0.5. Then I need to split it in two, so I send 0.5 to you and 0.5 to my own change address. And the change address is used for privacy reasons, among others, so it's not clear if I just sent those coins only to addresses of my own or all of it to others, or which one that might have been a payment. It's like taking a bunch of gold bars previously given to you, melting it down into one pot, and splitting it up into pieces of the sizes you want to send.

I remember TCP, IP, HTML and HTTP too. Protocols like this gets updated, not replaced. Even HTTP 2.0 is copying features from Google's SPDY, but it's still HTTP. The competing protocols almost never have any real chance, they just get their main features copied by the current main protocol, then they fade into oblivion.

I am willing to discuss it, but your ideas simply aren't good enough. They have already been proven to not work in various ways before, so discussing the specifics of why *this* version won't work isn't all that interesting.
If you can come up with a more original idea, I'd be happy to discuss it and it's consequences.


I know it isn't - but you're mixing up your different assumptions. The problem of sorting out spam from a social network is a different one from the one of finding specific data that you want. I can specifically pick the data that comes from my IRL friends.
But once you have a full social network it gets incredibly messy, and people are no longer picky on who they add as friends, on what they vote up, on what they click on, and so on. Your suggestion only works if people does all those things perfectly all the time. And that includes the requirement that they can read the mind of everybody, even if they appear to be 100% legit (otherwise spammers can pretend to be normal people for a few weeks and then start spamming).


But your problem here is that you don't understand how profitable spam is. It won't cost them more than they'll earn! If you try to make it unprofitable by raising the cost, you'll also scare away a significant proportion of your users!


It can with a proper whitelist. But people don't apply proper whitelists in their daily usage of social networks.


Nobody will want to use a client like that. Too much good content will be filtered out. No algorithm can be perfect at filtering out spam, because algorithms can't know exactly what the user want and don't want.


Spammers will use those tools as well. You can't stop them.


But the current systems aren't perfect.


Standard machine learning where users can report spam is much more efficient. Your version has a whole lot of useless overhead.

Even if your method is secure, it's easier to launch stealthy targeted attacks against you once you're going to make a transaction if they know how you did it. It's harder to target somebody if you don't know how they did it.
The best way is to learn how to do it several different ways that all are secure, and then use just some of them for various amounts.
How many methods you use and how complex they would be depends entirely on how paranoid you are. :)

The balance is recorded in the blockchain, so all you need is the keys. If you back it upp regularly (assuming that app creates new addresses over time to add anonymity, many of them do) then you're not at any significant risk of losing any bitcoins through key loss.
When you import keys (using the import options of the wallet software) you copy the private keys in to the software, either by scanning a Qr code, writing it down, pointing the wallet software to a file or similiar.
It will then scan the blockchain for which coins your keys control and tell you how many coins you have.

@_date: 2013-06-08 17:55:34
Because a transaction in Bitcoin is essentially references to old transactions you've recieved + instructions about where to send those coins now that you've decided to spend them.
Transaction fees is based on the size of the transaction data, and "dust coins" are worth less than what the size they add to transactions costs in fees, so spending them costs you more than they are worth.
Other than that, Bitcoin has no problems with spending the coins from several of your addresses at once in a single transaction, and you can even send the coins to multiple recipients in one transaction.

This can't be detected. Nobody will willingly generate vanity addresses that are subject to stricter rules, and there's no way to tell algorithmically if an address is a vanity address or not.


Not possible. If the attacker knows exactly what the owner knows (including all secret keys), there's no algorithmical/cryptographical way of preventing forgery/theft. Edit: If they can get your key, they can likely wipe your copy = low chance for successfully canceling a forged transaction. Also, they could forever stop you from spending the coins yourself. 
Vanity addresses are only weaker if generated with poor key generation tools.

Electrum is easy to learn. Once you understand the basics, it won't confuse you. Backing up it's 12 word deterministic seed on paper should be fine for you. Keep it secret! Do you want to set up a separate offline Linux computer for holding the seed/private keys?

Heh, I was just going to attempt to calculate that (I figured that calculating the number of possible calculations using all energy in the universe would be better.)
Just one note - that assumes that you're only counting. Divide ~2^300 with the amount of operations to generate the public key from the private key in ECDSA + the amount of operations to calculate SHA256 on that + calculating RIPEMD160 on *that* + comparing that checksum to the checksum of the key you're bruteforcing (I'm assuming that adding +1 for counting is just a single operation).
Also, since bruteforce on average succeeds after going through half the keyspace (thanks to statistics), add one bit to your ~300 bit number that can be calculated with all that energy.

Once again, how do you think it knows what belong to which connection? Do you even know what packet switched networks are? This isn't a phone network where you create a tunnel in the routers themselves beteen the endpoints, with anything over the internet the routers do not know anything other than what the data in each and every individual data packet says. Practically everything that is sent over the internet is sent in TCP/IP or UDP/IP packets that are up to about 1500 bytes large each.
Those accosiations you are talking about are *exactly* what I'm talking about, it's done by the VPN through tagging each and every data packet sent by the clients, so that the servers can reply with the same tag on the data packets, so that when the VPN recieves data packets, it can look at the tag and know who it's for.

The link I posted mentions that unconditionally secure authentication method (as far as I know it's the same method you talked about before). It uses a key to select a number of hashes from a family of hashes that is used in rounds to create a tag.
Length of hash = the length of the hash outputs in that family of hashes. Their outputs is 1/2 their inputs, so that's why they are done in rounds. You take parts of the message and run the hashes on them, then combine those hashes 2 and 2 and hashes them, until you have one hash that you turn into a tag. The hashes used in each round is determined by (one part of) the key.
You have 1 one time pad per tag, as long as the tag, if you want to reuse keys.
Rounds of quantum key distribution. You're going to run out of one time pads for the tags, which means that at some point you can't authenticate messages. That's why you need to exchange new one time pads for new messages.


I don't. The one time pads (applied to the tags) are there to enable key reuse. Without one time pads the scheme does not guarantee security if you reuse keys.


Nope, but you need to authenticate every one time pad you create. If you would run the QKD to create new one time pads but don't authenticate every created one time pad, then you can be MITM'ed. It's not enough to authenticate just once, the attacker can show up in between QKD rounds.

The single largest possible problems in Bitcoin is flaws in the crypto algorithms. SHA256, ECDSA, Merkle tree checksums, etc. If they can't be broken, then the biggest flaws that could be found in Bitcoin will be relatively minor bugs that could be mildy disruptive.
If they can be broken, but it won't be plausible to successfully break them within a week from discovery of the flaw, then the broken algorithms will be replaced before they become actual problems.
I believe that whoever manages to break those algorithms, if anybody does, then they will likely be responsible enough to not publish the exact details for a while, and just prove it to certain trusted organizations and people to make sure everybody understand that it's time to start the switch to another algorithm.


For the 0.7/0.8 fork, they contacted all the mining pools and the exchanges to reverse it quickly. How they'll do in the future depends entirely on the kind of flaw found.

Litecoin simply isn't different enough. Silver didn't get that role next to gold for anything other than having similar physical properties but being somewhat more abundant leading to a lower price per unit and thus was usable for paying small amounts without the coins becoming as small as dust.

How about this? 
E-ink screen, capacitive touch surface, and when you make a transfer it shows you all the details on the screen and you enter a PIN for the wallet you want to spend from. No need to enter anything on the card reader.

I suggest AES with XTS mode if you have that cipher mode in the list. Otherwise look for an authenticated mode like GCM.

Do you even know what fear mongering is? 
Do you honestly think Cryptocat is safe to use for anybody who needs high security? 
I have provided links to other people saying the same thing. Plenty of cryptographers distrust it. 
Switching to a plugin as the default is not enough. That's just one of the more trivial issues (avoiding javascript manipulation on websites).
The protocol is the main problem problem, and that is bad. It's still a bad design. And that's the problem. It is overwhelmingly likely that there is a ton of holes left waiting to be exploited. 
That have not changed. And the author Just Does Not Understand what it is that makes something cryptographically secure. The RNG among others is just incomprehensibly dumb.
It doesn't matter if it isn't currently proven bad. Would you walk on a bridge built by somebody who is notorious for all his bridges collapsing catastrophically? No? Then why would anybody ever trust Cryptocat?
He has not at all in any way down that his protocol is trustable, therefore it should NOT EVER be trusted. 
**And that is the main problem, the one he has NOT addressed**, the whole reason he is said to dismiss advice. The RNG among others has remained crap for ages, despite warnings. 
I would say the same about anybody and everybody, including myself. If you don't have a established track record of getting crypto right,  your protocol shall not be trusted until cryptographers with a track record says it's good. 
The other software you mention DO have such trusted cryptographers vouching for it. And they are far less likely to have exploitable issues. And they get fixed faster, and always gets fixed RELIABLY.

You can still optimize that through checking on Bitcoin forums or news article comments for which names that appear there and try the corresponding SSN:s for those first. If you've ever said "nice, I'll try that" using a name that can be tied to you personally when somebody says that you can include your SSN in a brainwallet password, then you can bet your SSN will be among the first tested. So you can reduce 1 million to maybe 10 000, which would give around 13 bits or so, if you're lucky.
There's 25x GPU rigs not much larger than a desktop computer that can crack 350 billion passwords (Windows' NTLM hashes) per second. 64 bits = 2^64 = 18 446 744 073 709 551 616. Now assume an adversary who can afford to build 10 000 such rigs.
18 446 744 073 709 551 616 / (350 000 000 000 * 10 000) = 5 270,5 seconds = 1,46 hours.
80 bits are 2^16 times harder, and cracking it with the same rig takes a total of 345 407 377 seconds = 10 years, 11 months and 13 days.
Now let's assume you'll be using your brainwallet for +30 years because you're lazy (there's lots of people who does this IRL, can verify it) and that there's multiple groups who are trying these attacks and that it's profitable enough due to higher Bitcoin value and people still using bad passwords. A very large amount of brainwallets will fall. And the kind of people who thinks "hey, I'll throw my SSN in there" are very likely to not understand what makes a password strong and what doesn't, leading to stolen coins.
You should aim for a password with entropy matching the full 160 bits that RIPEMD160 (used for the Bitcoin addresses) can "express", and you should be VERY conservative (pessimistic) in your entropy assumptions for each part of your brainwallet password.
My suggestion is basically to make up a pass poem in the style of Jabberwocky, with Yoda style grammar, if you want to use a brainwallet.

For ECDSA that Bitcoin uses, yes. It is derived from the private key. 
Note that Bitcoin actually defines the addresses as the RIPEMD160 hash of the SHA256 hash of the ECDSA public key. 
To spend coins you show that your public key matches those hashes, and then you create a cryptographic signature with the private key to show that the key belongs to you and that you authorized the transaction.

All of them. Start of with learning about how bitcoin works at the wiki.
Then read up on the history a bit, and check the historical value for reference.
And whatever you do, don't invest more than you can afford to lose. If it will hit millions per BTC, you'll still be a millionaire if you only buy 1 BTC. No need to spend everything you've got for 100 BTC, considering the value might fall long before it reaches those levels, and that you never know when you'll need that money. If you suddenly need the money in the middle of a crash on the Bitcoin market, you're going to lose LOTS of money. You must prepare for the value potentially dropping hard and staying down for years after you bought in, before it goes up again (if ever). You can never know for sure!

Instead of having a CPU that takes arbitary code, and in this case would run SHA256 code with the given input, the SHA256 algorithms *is wired in the hardware*. You don't have multiplication instructions, you don't have memory mapping instructions, you just take data as input and run SHA256 on it. SHA256 is The One Instruction that they run.
There overhead is tiny in comparison. The generalized CPU:s those devices have just pass around the work to process to the SHA256 calculation circuits and check if a block has been successfully mined (check if a checksum matches the given pattern). And this is a very simple task in comparision.

More or less yes, you can have the same private keys in multiple wallets.
But don't use two different wallets with the same keys too close in time, you might accidentally "double-spend", invalidating one of your payments (this is due to how Bitcoin and the software wallets tracks your funds).
Also, having your private keys "in the cloud" isn't as secure as only having them locally or on paper. There's a signficantly higher risk of hackers getting to them. If they can get to your private keys, it's like them getting a copy of your bank card+PIN.

That is why division by zero is intentionally left undefined. There's no meaningful consistent answer. You got 0 * infinity = 0 through division with zero. And actually there's no real answer to that equation either. 
By the way, a surface can have finite area but an infinite fractal border. Same way as a volume can be divided in infinitely many "disks". And the same way a line can be divided in infinitely many points. 
But the surface, volume and line all remains finite. Dividing them in smaller pieces only gives you smaller shares of it!

Well then; Download the blockchain. Verify it the regular way. Now, generate hashes of every block and keep that hash list. This list provides no less security than the blockchain you generated it from (assuming you can protect it from changes). You can also make it a chain by letting each block's hash be generated both from that block and from the hash of the previous block (makes it harder to make undetected changes). When you need a particular block, you can ask for it and verify it.
I haven't read exactly how SPV clients work. Do they also store (some) entire blocks?


Yes, but I was not saying this would replace full clients. This would be more something like a partial client.


That's like saying "if you haven't built a Lego car you don't know it can work, you only think it can work". I know enough about the components to know that it can work, I just don't know enough to build this particular thing. I could figure it out, though.

The MPK is meant to allow an online computer to track the balance of your wallet without exposing the private key to any network, and to generate unsigned transactions that an offline computer later can sign. 
The MPK scheme uses a public ECDSA key and an instruction for how to modify it to create new keys (in a long never ending chain), and the corresponding private key can be modified the same way to generate matching private keys for the new public keys). That way you don't need to move any secret "key material". The offline computer can generate all the private keys and the corresponding public keys itself. 
Electrum has an import option for regular keys, and a restore option where you can enter an MPK.

I'm Swedish. I can't know the exact spelling of every english word.
Mt Gox has not consistently been the largest for the past few months. Also, it has has issues with bank transfers, impacting the price significantly. Most exchanges has not had that problem. And you should still use the weighted average, as individual exchanges still are likely to be more volatile that the market as a whole (statistical reasons, you know).
Not to mention that anything that is growing fast is bound to have a high average volatility if the measure is based on comparing the percentage difference in price between fixed time periods. So basically only the peaks is interesting on that chart. The total value of all bitcoins is still less than most international companies, and can't really become a global every day currency until it's grown to be larger than several of them together.
Because seriously, a company can't buy something worth 100 billion dollars with something that is worth less than that in total, and Bitcoin is bound to end up being used for purchases like that since it is far easier to do securely with Bitcoin than with banks. Just consider the possibility for the company to use things like Shamir's Secure Sharing Scheme + Secure Multiparty Computation with a pretty interface for the software (all they need to do is to verify the transaction is correct and enter their passwords to confirm) for the board members (together with whoever else that needs to approve it) to securely sign the transaction that pays for the deal from the company's cash reserves, even if they're not all in the same place at once, without any single individual ever being able to know the private key. It can literally be a 1 minute process, no need to go through banks. It cuts out tons of overhead.
Besides, what are you expecting from a decentralized currency that's still 5 years old? How long do you think it took gold to establish a stable long term value? And Bitcoin mimics many of gold's economical properties (like scarcity, divisibility, etc). Have anybody told you it's not going to take a long while before it stabilizes? Even if you think the volatility is extreme, nobody's telling anybody here put more than they can afford to lose into it, and most merchants are being pointed to Bitpay who takes care of the volatility for them, so they're not at risk anyway.
More volatile than ever? It's still less than April, so you're still wrong (saying it's the second highest might be correct, though, but then you're still not going by the historical data from back to 2010).
And I would still like to note that the falls from the bubble peaks have been smaller each time, counted in percentages. That is also reality. I'm not surprised the price jumps up and down quickly when there's tons of news at once, of which much is hard to interpret the long-term impact of (senate hearings, China treating it as a commodity, etc). It would be more interesting if you showed the average range of the price fluctuations over time (as in +/- X% per 7 day period).
And last of all, what's your point? That nobody should use Bitcoin? Or that people should be aware of the risks? If it's the former, then you obviously need to read up about what it enables that will make sure it is going to stick around. If the second, then obviously I agree. People should be aware there's a risk, and I've been saying that myself. I'm always pointing out that nobody should spend more than they can afford to lose. Even if it's probably going to go up long term, people could end up being forced to cash out in the middle of a crash.

Secure Multiparty Computation - it's like a virtual machine that several parties run together, but thanks to cryptography nobody can see what is happening on the inside unless they all collude. That is why you need these parties to be conflicting (different political parties and various civil organizations).
The idea is that that scale of collusion will be too hard to hide.
My system can't stop all attacks, but is designed to make them extremely visible to everybody, so that if trust is lost then the vote can be started over. Stopping silent attacks is my main priority. And visible attacks will be heavily discouraged by the voters.

Yes it does, because people will be marking it as "not spam", so that the spammers gets their "deposition" back. Because you know, if it's not in the inbox it probably is in the spam folder. 
And it still doesn't solve the problem of hacked accounts. This alone kills it. 
If you set it up dollars pet recipient, it is already dead. No human will ever put in $500 to be able to send a group mail to all of their computer illiterate family who never will click  "not spam" (not inconsistent, as it's two different groups of people). Also, mailing lists would be dead. 
If you want to start sending mail, you need to deposit an amount directly. 
How do mailing lists add themselves to a whitelist? Are you going to tell people to set an exception in advance or that they should look in their spam folder to flag it as not spam? 
My English is fine, both the reading comprehension and in writing. 
Let me clarify. 
People in poor countries will not afford the deposits/fees required by people in richer countries, stopping them from easily communicating with them. 
Because you know, even that very first deposit will be a week's pay. Or you didn't know, in which case you need to read up about the world. 
Hacked accounts are already along the most common sources of spam. Your suggestion will push it to the top. 
Are you suggesting the mail will end up in a folder separate from the spam folder? Because otherwise that's the same as automatically flagging it as spam.

It is if you have a Quantum Turing complete quantum computer. But for the reasons mentioned above, building this type of fulle generalized multi-purpose quantum computers is HAAAARD!!! If you DO manage to build one with thousands or even millions of qubits though, THEN you can run stuff like SHA256 hashes. HOWEVER, you would STILL not get much of a benefit from it due to how it works with probabilities.
Also, we have quantum resistant public key crypto. We can switch away from ECDSA (ECC) if such a computer would appear.

These people have likely handled large sums of cash before sometime in their lives. And it's not let they never have made bank transfers either between account numbers.

There's the "full Bitcoin nodes", there's wallet clients who are either full nodes or lightwheight clients (the former keeps a copy of the blockchain, the latter uses a server), and there's the mining clients, and they all use the same basic protocols.
The blockchain is the central part of the Bitcoin system, since it's more or less it's accounting system. Modifying it would require that you have more computing power than THE ENTIRE REST OF THE NETWORK, a so called 51% attack.
The software clients such as the wallets and the miners usually don't have that many exploitable flaws. In general, spyware is a more efficient way for hackers to get people's coins. And that requires hacking people individually.
There's not that many ways one could mess with the blockchain itself otherwise.

Most complaints regarding Coinbase is simply that people have been flagged as "high risk" erroneously. The company is simply trying to minimize their risk. They have a pretty good reputation. 
Do you want to hold Bitcoins yourself? 
The safest method for storage is paper wallets, the easiest wallet clients are likely Electrum and on Android this wallet app:
Keep backups of your wallet files. They contain the private keys used to cryptographically sign the transactions, without the private keys in those files you can't spend the coins, so don't lose them! 
What kind of security level are you looking for? With surprisingly little work you could go as far as to etch a deterministic wallet seed on stainless steel covered in transparent epoxy, split up into several parts using Shamir's Secure Sharing Scheme (SSSS), stored as Qr codes. SSSS lets you require that one has for example 3 of 5 pieces to recover the data. You can pick those two numbers arbitrarily. Qr codes also has error correction, partial damage won't break it. 
The recovery method would simply be to scan the Qr codes with a webcam, copy and paste the outputs in an SSSS program, and copy and paste the output from there in Electrum, and then you can spend the coins. 
Etching ~5 steel plates with Qr codes is the only hard part.
A quicker option is to have the private keys/seed on an offline computer and let an online computer have the "public key seed" (called "master public key") which means the online computer only can be used to see how many Bitcoins you have and to create *unsigned* transactions. When you want to spend, you create unsigned transactions on the online computer, and use a USB stick to pass it on to the offline computer, and you then let that computer sign the transaction, and the the *signed* transaction is given to the online computer again and then sent. The offline computer should run some kind of Linux, ideally, like Linux Mint. Spending Bitcoins this way is a 2 minute process for most people. 
For the legal part, can't help you there. You need to talk to lawyers about that. There already are some specializing on law related to digital currencies. 
By the way, Bitpay can let you pick a percentage split for the payments/donations to you, like 80/20% or 50/50% USD and Bitcoins.

Ah, well then, I think such an attacker could take half the Bitcoins in hours if he has a fast enough quantum computer.

So you mean they're funding unprofitable pirating with drug money? WHY!? Why on earth would they bother? Pirating isn't the same as smuggling. Raiding ships and taking what they have is something different. Why are they doing *that*?


Not *internally*. I mean across the market. For many things the majority of the market have to cooperate for it to work well.


The problem is that sometimes the incentives are stronger to go their own way, because the customers wants to hire a strong company to defend them, which means that the biggest ones have little incentive to do everything the way the customers want them to.


I'm not saying goverments are perfect or even near perfect. But on the other hand, there's (usually) more accountability and safeguards.


I strongly disagree on the incentives. Companies have incentives to twist the truth, skip everything that costs them money, etc... The idea that companies will have the incentive to do exactly what the customers want only holds up if there's thousands of competitors, if all the customers are sure of what they want, if all customers know exactly what all the companies provide, and if the companies know *why* people are ditching them for others. Usually there's just some best compromise - if that best compromise gets worse but not worse than the second best, it's customers have no reason to switch even though things got worse for them. If people can't even figure out what the best or next best option is, how on earth does this work? What if it's too unprofitable for most companies to provide what the customers actually need?


No, I want people that understand how things work (like how to run a police force), and have them accountable for what they do. I simply don't trust a 100% unregulated market to provide everything (or even two thirds of it) the people need.
Also - the kind of entirely unregulated society you talk about is the kind of society in which the first goverments came to being, several thousand years ago. How would you stop everything from just going back to how it is now?

It holds 100 unused keys/addresses, and generates new ones as you spend and recieve coins. So the more often you spend, the more often you should back it up.
Electrum and Armory are however "deterministic", they uses secret "seeds" to calculate a bunch of private keys and their respective addresses for you, so you only need to back up that seed.

The password is what is used to encrypt copies of the wallet.

Each transaction is made of inputs and outputs. In this case, there's 175 inputs that points to the previous transactions where he got the coins. Usually there's just a few (most of them between 1-10) inputs. The large amount of inputs makes the transaction large.

Edit: skip this part. 
The easy way?
 - it is easier if you both use this wallet app
Open settings to set your local currency for it. Then tap "receive Bitcoins" at the bottom of the main screen. Enter the value to request. Tap the Qr code to make it larger, so it is easier to scan. 
The other person taps the camera icon at the bottom, scans the Qr code. He will now be prompted to accept making that payment. If he accepts, the coins will be sent. 
The payer has to move coins to his wallet app first, of course. 
There are other compatible apps as well, but I prefer that one.
Sorry, that's not for if they don't have Bitcoins already. 
Try Bitpay instead.

Guerillas are not, but dictatorships would be, but you wouldn't really call a small group of a dozen armed people a goverment. Once a single group controls a large amount of people you can call that a goverment, IMHO. I didn't say that goverments certainly *would* form, but I am saying that with a very high probability, armed violent groups *would* exploit others and attempt to take control. You can be pretty sure that a large portion of the population would still end up having to take orders from one group or another.

So suddenly a sybil attack becomes cheap but a matter of time then? Just get a fraction of the hash power and keep the network offline for about 7 * average block time/your own average time to find a block. 
So if you have 1/5 as much power as the rest of the network and the block time is 5 minutes, you have to keep enough nodes unconnected to the honest miners for 175 minutes, or just below 3 hours. And that is assuming you start your malicious mining at the same time as you start messing with the network. You could potentially start mining a little before you start attacking the network and then start the network attacks 5 * block time = 25 minutes after you started mining, and then cause a 5 block reorganization once you 150 minutes or 2 1/2 hours later publish your own chain.

If you imported the private keys to the Blockchain.info site, then yes you still have the coins if you kept the original keys yourself.
If you made a transfer to keys you didn't backup, then they are lost.
By default most Bitcoin clients create new keys from time to time for you. You should back it up at least monthly if you use it a lot. If you make A LOT of transaction on a daily/weekly basis, then make at least weekly backups.
If you use "deterministic" wallets, then the keys generated by it is based on a seed that doesn't change, you only need to back up it's wallet if you import "external keys", i.e. any keys that weren't generated from that seed.
For "brain wallets" (a type of deterministic wallets), the seed is based on your password. For the rest, the password is only a decryption key for the seed and/or the private keys. You need to private keys in unencrypted form to spend your coins.

Most miners have a bit more than that. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 22:04:18
Each block is rewarded to one pool OR one solo miner.
Who gets it is based on statistic probabilities based on how many SHA256 computations the miners perform - somebody who is twice as fast as another person has twice the chance to get the block. Your chance per block if solo-mining is about (total computing power in the Bitcoin network) / (your computing power).
When mining in a pool, it's that same calculation but with the pool's total computing power, and the reward is about 25 * (your computing power) / (total computing power in your pool). So when a block goes to a pool, it is split internally among the pool members according to how much computing power they have spent (this is done accurately thanks to the "shares model", the miners repeatedly reports their "best-so-far answers", more or less, to the pool manager, this works pretty well in most cases).
Most people mine in pools, so the large pools has the largest chance for each individual block to be the recipient of the block reward.
It's never more than 25 coins per block. It halves about every 4 years, in a few years it will be 12.5 coins per block.

That's what I commented in the first place. It doesn't sound like he understand how entropy works for passwords. The second part adds nearly nothing if it's fixed or if you can guess it with just a laptop anyway.


Sure, but I meant "many" as in "below ~40", since ~15 also can be considered many. So if you think your password is secure because it's long and has "many" words, but it just has 20 words that all are "one" and "zero" (or maybe "heads" and "tails"), then it's not secure enough.


By "predictable" I mostly meant "more probable than random" (bias towards non-random). Despite that many think that "password1" is unguessable, it's trivial to break.
Either way, I personally use 20 character passwords generated by KeePassX. Estimated to represent 120 bits of entropy.

The later transactions supercedes the previous ones. Sending them all would be a doublespend attempt = invalid. You can only get one of them included in the blockchain and validated, not all of them. And I guess the service provider won't transmit any others than the latest one.
(New transactions always specify which previous transactions they claim coins from. You can't claim a transaction twice. If you don't spend the whole sum at an address in a transaction, that's where "change transactions" (to yourself) come into the picture. So you let all these microtransactions point to the same previous transactions, but with different sums of BTC authorized for transaction for payment. Thus only one of them can be validated and included in the blockchain.)

It's not very compressed (or compressable) due to the "entropy density". You can rarely compress random numbers that much, and the blockchain is full of them (addresses, nonces, hashes, etc...).

Everybody works on slightly different blocks - the first transaction in each block is the minting transactions where the miner claims the block reward to himself. 
This adds enough "entropy" to the hashing for nobody to repeat the same inputs. 
If using pooled mining, the pool manages this by giving different "ranges" of random numbers to test to the miners. 
Bitcoin uses two rounds of SHA256 in such a specific way that you're not ever going to see it crack a password hash. 
The number of possible hash values is absurdly massive. 2^256 is like multiplying the number of grains on sand on earth with itself a dozen times. Imagine as many earths as we have grains of sand, and them just keep going down this rabbit hole for several steps, and then try to find a very specific very rare grain of sand with some given properties among all these grains of sand. 
By the way, it looks for "lower than xyz" for hashing, not xyz itself. The lower xyz is, the harder, thus a difficulty level you can adjust. When lower than xys us found, the block is published and people confirm it is indeed lower than xyz AND follows the rule. 
Then people start working on a block with *that* block being referenced.

Take a look at Zerocoin (user zero-knowledge proofs). You start with one address, make a "Zerocoin deposit" and anonymously withdraws it with another address.

My bank has this already (in Sweden). 
We have security tokens where each transfer requires us to enter a number based on the transaction sum on the device and enter the output number back on the bank site. Every time you transfer to somebody you haven't transfered to before, you also have to enter a number based on that person's account number and then enter the output back on the bank site.
Some of the other actions just give you random numbers to enter on the token, and then you enter the response back.
The device generates the numbers using a shared secret stored in protected memory (tamper proof and all that) which only that device and the bank has. (The device also requires a PIN to be activated.)

The coins are associated with the private keys (using cryptography with the ECDSA algorithm) in your wallet.dat file. Do you still have the old hard drive? It should have the wallet file there, so you can move the keys over to the new one.

I've suggested this once before:
There could be one official address for the business, and for each transaction address, there could be a message that ties it to the official address which is signed by that official address' ECDSA key, and that signed message would be encrypted (maybe using AES-GCM). The key for this message would be given to the buyer together with the transaction address. The buyer can then share the decrypted signed message and point to the blockchain to prove the payment in the case of a conflict.

I'm looking at it more from the point of making malice hard and expensive, like Bitcoin itself. If you are trying to abuse your power, I want it to be impossible to hide and so hard to pull off that it's not worth trying. I'd say I rank stopping malice just above personal freedom (not far away, though). If it's not profitable to act maliciously anyway, these people will see they have no choice but to cooperate on equal terms with the rest of the people.
I'm thinking that profiling can be made far harder by splitting up votes with "higher granularity" into several pieces in a way that won't alter the statistics such that the outcome remains the same, and prove Zerocoin style that each piece indeed belongs to one valid vote, and that no piece from any vote is duplicated. That would allow people to securely rank or grade different choices without the output from the vote being linkable to you. You could look at the hashes of your zero-knowledge proofs and use them as the nonces in my other suggested scheme, to have something you can *know* comes from *your* vote but that nobody else can prove is yours, allowing you to verify your vote was included as intended. (I think I'm going to publish another zerocoin inspired version like this soon.)
Using something like I2P would probably be a requirement for publishing your votes.
Your suggested subgroup method is extremely easy to attack through blocking the vote. If you have a district that share the same opinion, you can block their vote by planting one guy there who insists on not accepting the vote. Districts with near total consensus can also bully out dissent by blocking the vote for as long as there's somebody who votes differently, which actually will work in most cases as it's likely those voters will give up.

Then you fake 10x as many trustable nodes as the existing network and 100x as many fake nodes. Let the first group win all disputes. Bam, now you have a shitload of highly trusted nodes and can pWn everybody.
Also, how do you handle out-of-sync databases? If you compare hashes, everybody must base them on identical data.
Edit: ~~After reading the link, there's something missing between  and  - how do you handle doublespends? ALL clients must ALWAYS use EXACTLY the same algorithm to decide which spending attempt to honor/accept. This can't be changed unless everybody change it at once, otherwise you get a netsplit~~  Also, what about propagation? What if not all clients get all the same updates? This can happen because of network issues and more (which you can't always avoid). Also, for how long does rounds last? Doublespends will likely not be seen by everybody during each round. Otherwise you must have a fixed perios of time where updates can be issued, and then there has to be a waiting period for propagation so that everybody gets a copy. This is VERY inefficient.
Also, you have major DoS issues, it's too easy to flood the network.


Not possible. You can't have all updates distributed that fast to everybody AND agreed upon by everybody in that timeframe.


A highly volatile network would be more reliable than statistical probability? The hashrate is very stable when measured over an hour.
Edit: Here's how a sybil attack/the equivalent of a 51% attack will work on your network:
Imagine your network as dots on a paper. Draw lines between the dots that are closest to each other.
Now you dump a ton of powder over that. Those are the fake nodes. How many honest nodes will now be connected to more than just a few other honest nodes? You can easily split up the network this way.

Random coding bug. They probably mix coins around internally when you do sweeps and stuff like that, and this could be a memory/data structure issue where an address/key from the "wrong set" (from the set of keys belonging to users, not their own internal keys) is used to pass it on.
Don't know how they managed to screw that up this way.

But wasn't your complaint about unfair returns?
And you don't have to hand money over to anybody that holds Bitcoin either. You can earn it too, or try mining. 
Do you feel the same about gold? Is your complaint solely about people being rewarded for simply holding? Because Bitcoin isn't alone in that regard. 
Those people took a risk, and supported something that could have failed. 
How is that possibly Bitcoin's fault? Anything that people abandon INCLUDING YOUR ALTCOINS will fall in value. People don't want the old money because they can get something that is better. In what way do they lose anything at switching to Bitcoin? How could they gain anything on an altcoin? Those who abandon ship last will almost always end up losing. 
Also, what if Bitcoin goes up further as the economy grows, leaving them with the equivalent of 50 naira? 
And by the way, hyperinflation is far worse than your worst case 50% loss scenario.

1: Take a random string.
2: XOR a private key with it, the output is the XOR key for that keypair.
3: Repeat  for all your private keys. When done, go to 4.
4: Store that first random string on a paper, the rest of those XOR keys are to be stored elsewhere. You might generate a series of words to represent them and remember that, or you hide them in various places.
Adding error correction codes is optional.

Basically Ripple-altcoins? Bitcoin seems to hold up fine against the Bitcoin-forked altcoins.


Everybody who think this is a good idea deserve to fail.
What if somebody finds a way to shred the security into pieces instantly when it's open sourced? What if somebody manages to alter the trade history so that the attack can't be reversed (assuming there's no backups close enough in time)? Release the source code early when you're can prepare for people finding fundamental flaws in your design. Don't wait until there's a massive userbase at stake that can be harmed.
(Not that bugs can't be found without the source code, but *design flaws* and other such flaws are easier to find with the source code than without it. The binaries might hold up to various automated bug scanning tools, but that don't mean there's no security holes in it.)

The architecture is much more secure than something like Mega, and properly designed and implemented. You can have files that are readable but not writable to the public WITHOUT having to trust the servers because there's a read-only key and a read-and-write key.

Simple. Against the hashes I store. If I chose to make a chain of the hashes, I take block 523 (as exampel) and check it against hash 523 and hash 522.


Did you not read my entire suggestion or did you forget it? I said that you at SOME point in time have to verify it from the start and up to the last block. But you don't need to keep the entire blockchain after that because you calculate hashes on every block before you "dump them".

I know what value stability is about. Assuming we are using the words in the same way. But the thing is that since, as you know, the numbers of bitcoins is limited, it is not possible for Bitcoin to stay at the same value per unit relative to other things (such as the dollar) for long. The link between market cap and per-unit value has a hard link in Bitcoin. It's simply total value for the Bitcoin market / number of coins. The Bitcoin market will grow much faster than the number of bitcoins. Unless you are talking about stable growth as in let's say 3 000% per year (or whatever Bitcoin is at), I don't think Bitcoin can be stable for another decade. But I believe it can reach stability.
Also, I'm not saying a large market cap always leads to stability. I'm saying that chances are higher that it won't jump or dive by 3x over a few days if it's used globally by a significant number of people.

And the clever part of Merkle hash trees is that you don't need all the inputs to one to confirm that the input you have is part of it.

No need for a list of every hash for every single transaction to be inside the block header. Just one Merkle hash tree.

Do you really think that nobody would exploit such a situation?


Nope. You need to learn how to apply logic. My statement is "Let's not switch to something else *if we don't/can't know if it's better*". We might very well end up worse off. You don't really have any kind of proof that what you suggest is better. It might just as well be worse. Find a way to prove it's better and I'll listen.

It's just like any other insurance, and this one simple comes with the credit cards. The idea is that people are willing to pay a small sum continously to decrease the risk of one day facing having to pay a very large sum at once, which they might not afford at that time.
The nice thing with Bitcoin is that it's just a transfer mechanism, and all these things are optional. Escrow, insurance, etc, you can decide for yourself if you want to use it and when and how. If you don't want it, you don't have to pay for it.

It's more about efficiency. If your ASIC miner uses the most efficient tech, then however small the miner is, as long as the overhead is small enough (such as electricity cost for the "management chip" and the internet connection) it's likely going to be profitable (if the most efficient tech isn't profitable to use, people will drop out of mining until it becomes profitable again).
@_date: 2013-08-16 22:22:24
It's about trust and choice.
Bitcoin lets you decide who to trust and how much to a point you never could before.
If you want to use Coinbase or Inputs.io, you can do so. And if you want to "cash out" into holding bitcoins on your own private wallet file, then you can do so. It's up to you if you want to trust them or not on being able to send the coins to you when you want them (financial liquidity), and on if they'll stay honest.
Note that in this case Bitcoins also enables *verifiable transparency* into the finances of companies like this to a degree that haven't been possible before, which could boost people's trust in their liquidity (since you can confirm it yourself and doesn't have to just trust their claims!).

And that's rolling out... how fast was it exactly? In most places it isn't financially viable to run two or more ISP:s in parallell! The only way to get more than two ISP:s in most places it to have the network owner rent out access to multiple ISP:s. But in most cases, there's big ISP:s who themselves owns the networks and that aren't willing to rent out access to others. The only option in this case to get options would be if everybody in the area ditched that ISP and started building their own network and then rented out access to the ISPs. And that's VERY expensive, and they'd be without any internet connection for AT LEAST several months, probably over a year.

If you're willing to make the coin digital (NFC), you can use zero knowledge proofs. That way the coin can prove the private key is stored on it but not reveal it. Or it would just generate a signature of your choice to prove it, but then you likely want to restrict how things can be signed.
But then you also have to trust that you can extract the private key, and that it won't be destroyed if you try to do it. Also, it has to be tamper proof (same issue as with the above mentioned seals).
The "easiest" solution to the problem with the seals is to make sure nobody can make identical seals. And that ain't easy.

Transactions are a set of inputs and outputs. The inputs are a list of unspent outputs from previous transactions, the outputs are the addresses of the recipients and the values they get. This includes your intended recipient and your own change address.
The sender pays the transaction fee through claiming outputs with a total value that is just above the total value assigned yo the recipients, and the miners claims what's left.
That means as an example, (1+2+1.3) - (2.4+0.8) = 0.1, where 0.1 is the transaction fee and where 0.8 is your change and 2.4 is what you sent. The first three are your inputs, payments you have received. 
The transaction fee is optional but recommended. The miners can reject transactions that has no fee or a too low fee.

1: Bitcoin is a protocol. It's like email. There's no one company or entity anywhere to be found that can control it. It's a decentralized ledger of account. Individual Bitcoins should be thought of as "tokens". There's a maximum of 21 million such tokens that can be created, and yes you can own fractions of them (you can have 0.00000001 bitcoins). Ownership is securely managed and verified using public key cryptography.

Transactions can not be modified, because the transactions can only be included unmodified since public key cryptography using ECDSA is used with digital signatures. Modifying the transactions breaks the signatures. The coin owner specifies directly in the transaction how large fee he wants to pay. What miners can do is to reject transactions with low fees or that they otherwise don't like.

As far as I know, with P=NP some problems would go from absurdly excessively astronomically difficult to "just" very difficult. Problems can still be expentially hard relative to the input size.




I need to read slower...
I noted that I wrongly questioned my own assumption before about the numbers for the computations of the tags. With 128 bit tags you can go from 256 &gt; 512 &gt; 2048 &gt; 8 388 608 &gt; 2^(65536-1)*128*2 bits. And that 1 MB key generated in the 3rd round can then sign a large one time pad.
By the way, the speed record for QKD seems to be 1 mbps. For a 1 TB one time pad generated in the 4th round it would take 128 seconds for 16 megabytes of tags (1 million tag OTP:s) before you can calculate your first authentication tag from a key from the 3rd step. But QKD is quite fragile, so can you imagine how easy to DoS this would be? Just screw up one bit too many of those millions, and it has to be redone. So you probably need dozens of steps as you really never should wait more than a few seconds to authenticate the transmitted data (or in this case, the generated one time pad).
And I want to point out again that it's still unproven that QKD can be secure against MITM.

Which doesn't matter in any way at all, because if you're not on the real banking site, has malware or is MITMd, then it doesn't matter that you enter the real account number - the scammers will swap it out for their own, and you'll never know until the recipient complains about not getting the money.


That assumes that the user is ignorant. It's not much different than assuming the user will accept all UAC prompts and install all malware always. My bank uses devices where you have to enter the sum and the numbers in the recipient's bank account on the device to get the authentication codes to enter on the bank site in order to accept the transactions. Without those authentication codes, the bank will reject the transaction attempt.

So how much do you know about quantum computers?
My entire point is that this isn't "trivially reducable", Bitcoin mining will not be taken over by quantum computers. Do you really think you can have a quantum computer test all possible nonce and timestamp computations faster than a 500 GH/s rig? Those rigs go through all those 32+8 bits in 0.55 seconds.
Your quantum computer must run MULTIPLE rounds of quantum computation in those 0.55 seconds just to be able to find the correct output.
Then you need to reorder the transactions and calculate a new Merkle tree hash. And start over the quantum computation, also within those 0.55 seconds before the next round, or otherwise your quantum computer CAN NOT be more profitable than a 500 GH/s ASIC miner (unless somebody manages to build it cheaper than an ASIC and cool it's qubits down to near 0 K for cheaper than you can run a 500 GH/s ASIC.
The other option is obviously to run ALL computations on the qubits, including the Merkle tree hash, reordering and 2 rounds of SHA256. In which case you need millions of qubits or more, and today's record is 511 qubits for a quantum computer that isn't even a general quantum computer (extremely limited in what it can compute). Getting that many qubits in superposition and making them stay coherent until measurement AND setting it up again fast enough to mine Bitcoins, that ain't easy.
Since the output from the quantum computer must be a full valid block if you let it compute everything on it's own, then it must also have enough qubits to to hold a full block in it's quantum memory.
If you think I'm talking out of my ass, please try to disprove any of it.
Quantum computers **DO NOT** find the correct result in a single round.
Edit: 


So yes, the entire block needs to fit in the quantum memory.

How do they do it *now*? The bounty pays for further attacks. 


No, but the disorganization will only be worse. Law enforcement in different states can already be hesitant to work together, sometimes because they feel they compete to some degree. Imagine when crimefighting is a business like all others, the willingness to work together will be even lower! They'll all want to take each others' work. It would be much less investigation, people would rather hire something like private armies.
How do you prevent people from wanting to take what others have? How will you prevent people from attacking the poor? And there's already plenty of people who willingly do all kinds of dirty work for money. Also, if you get attacked by a gang, who do your neighbours call? There will be no "the cops". Do they call *their* own private enforcement company? Yours? Who comes to defend you? You won't always be able to make the call yourself. Who defends and helps unidentified people, in general (every time somebody calls 911 and don't know who the people involved is)? 
Every time I just see people keep claiming "the free market will solve it" and "monopolies won't be possible" and "people won't be willing to act violently", but I never see anybody explain the mechanism for how (just some basic "but then the competitors will offer [whatever]" or "people won't allow it"), or try to deal with the hard problems. The reasoning just simply isn't solid enough.

You can have most of your coins in regular wallets, and keep some on green addresses the way you might do with a regular debit card.

Are there little correlation between the value of Bitcoin and what makes it valuable? That's how I interpret your answer given my comment.
Why would the value be disconnected from what you can do with it? Clearly, there's very little chance that it's potential uses won't change rapidly.
If you are talking about the predicted long-term value then you might be right. But there's just a fraction of the Bitcoin users who are in it for the long term (as in multiple decades), so their valuation of it doesn't have a significant impact. Most people are in it based on what they can do with it the next few months.
If you're talking about what impact Bitcoin will have and the (positive or negative) value of the changes it will cause, that is too unpredictable as well to say anything about.
So, again: WHY am I wrong about Bitcoin being *unlikely* to stabilize in value until the market has grown?
Do you think it's likely or that there's a 50/50 chance? If all factors would have been unknown then you could say that we can't even tell anything at all about the probability of it stabilizing at various points. But we already know several important details, and we know that there's just a small set of outcomes in which the value can be stable. And we can estimate the probability of those outcomes.
IMHO, Bitcoin will most likely stabilize first when most people who are interested in it and can benefit from using it over things like Paypal has adopted it. The volatility, which keeps people from using it as a primary currency, will stay high until the inflow and outflow is low compared to the market size.
Bitcoin isn't simply a technical tool like any other that does a particular job with the same efficiency no matter what happens around it. It depends on factors around it to a much greater degree. It's not an engine that always performs the same and always can handle the same load.

So any kind of code interpreter's cache (you know that most interpreters like Python and even the standard command line keeps a cache, right?), swap file if he has entered it recently. Recuva if the log has been deleted the normal way. Maybe he even uses C and compiles it and then deletes the binary.


You're making too many assumptions about why it would be hard. Some simple search algorithms really aren't that hard. File recovery isn't either (unless it's wiped with something like Eraser (several overwrites)). Just FYI, most malware are prepackaged these days, it just takes *one* malware author making a search algorithm like it, and running it on every computer they infect. Just look for some script that always only produces one output. Not that hard.
Also, you are seriously underestimating the probability that some malware author who knows these things with security can guess his way to his method and put that in a malware package, just like how there's password databases for common passwords. Often there's even some of the strangest things in there that people actually happen to use because they think nobody will crack it, and which gets cracked anyway.

Fully random alphanumeric with and without caps is 60 bits for 10 characters. That is below the 64 bits that already has been systematically broken on large rigs.

How would you make a "trusted node service" in a distributed and secure manner?
The best option I've heard of is proof-of-stake mining, but that (as implemented) has the problem of encouraging hoarding of coins even more in order to get an advantage at mining. Outsiders can't just "dive into" mining as easily as with proof-of-work, as a new miner you are inherently at a disadvantage.

You can do it that way. Note that USB memory sticks have limited lifetimes though! 
But it would likely be easier for you to use Electrum and write down the seed (12 words) it generates for you. It needs to be kept secret, as all private keys/addresses it generates will be based on that seed. You can then later on import that seed and recreate your private keys and access the funds. 
You would need to make a transaction first to one of the addresses Electrum shows you in the Receive tab.

You can't bruteforce a single properly generated private key in a thousand years with a supercomputer the size of Mount Everest. 
2^160 is massive. It's absurdly hard. An even 8 billion people represents about 2^33, leaving you with 2^127 keys per person to compute and check. Even with 1 000 keys in use per person you divide it by approximately 2^33 and then 2^10 leaving 2^84 keys per person to check to just find ONE SINGLE KEY with money on it.

@_date: 2013-12-04 22:57:51
You make up a random number consisting of 256 bits. You use ECDSA sep256k1 to calculate the public key from the private key. Do SHA256 on the public key, RIPEMD160 on that, do SHA256 on that byt only append the 4 bytes / 32 bits from it, append 8 bits set to zero. Encode as base58. (warning - some details may be wrong, don't take this as a guide) 
Then check the address against the addresses in the blockchain who holds Bitcoins. 
If you found a match, you create a Bitcoin transaction that claims those coins and you sign it with the private key using ECDSA sep256k1. Publish. If you didn't find a match, try again.
Edit: fixed

The Bitcoin protocol doesn't track balances, wallet clients do. The protocol tracks transactions.

You can't partially spend a transaction to you. But you don't have to spend all transactions to your address at once.

Yes and no. I called it the reference implementation. Without a proper spec written down, the current protocol is more or less defined as "what Bitcoin-Qt does/accepts". But that can change too if most people switch away from Bitcoin-Qt. If the community votes for another project to lead Bitcoin development by switching to their client, then that will essentially be the new reference implementation. 
The 5430 satoshis thing isn't a protocol level change on the blockchain side, since blocks with transactions of less coins will be accepted by everybody. On the transaction inclusion side it also isn't really a protocol change since it's intentionally made optional, miners are free to remove that limit. But it's the default.

No, there's no such tagging. It's technically possible, but you'll likely never get enough people onboard to get useful data out of it.

Bitmessage public key requests and responses can be identified by an ISP (or NSA). I2P with Bote mail is much more anonymous, and most likely more secure. And it's also fully P2P.

You can encode data in various ways. There are no standard, though.

All the common wallet file formats have multiple separate encrypted portions, of which some doesn't have private keys.

It's the nature of using private key cryptography without any external authority. It becomes your job to protect the data the protocol assumes you will keep secret.

Apache requires anybody who redistributes the code (maybe for some more circumstances to) to license any patents they own which apply to the code for free to anybody who has that same code.

Using Electrum and writing down it's generated seed words as a paper wallet is also a good choice. For maximum security, once the words and some of your own receiving addresses are written down, you can delete the Electrum wallet file. You can recover that wallet file later through the seed words you wrote down.

Linux AppArmor? Probably. You'll need to specify all the rules for how it can interact with other software and what other software can do to it. It's *hard* to write those rules so that they become bullet proof.

But not all hashes are published, how would they know? Or maybe they DO have a hash with a very low value that they're trying to attack, using Bitcoin with it's proof-of-work and the blockchain to see if there's any chance we'll create a collision for them. Not that a collision would be likely even with all the hashing power of the miners, but still.

But then any such intelligence would likely only happen in the transaction relaying parts of Bitcoin, and it would not have any significant amount of available memory or any meaningful room for taking actions.

1: Server based is a no-go. Don't want something that can get DDoS:ed into the ground, raided or otherwise made inaccessible.
2: Bots can still circumvent your system by imitating real users. Spam is profitable enough even on your system. And as you describe the design, spam could even overwhelm the system if the spam bots outnumber the active users. Which is easy to achieve.
3: People don't like fees.

There are too many requirements on the proof-of-work algorithm that only a few cryptographic algorithms like checksums/hashes fulfills. It's extremely difficult to make it work with algorithms that produce useful outputs.
