All above your gilded train!

Maybe talk to this redditor?

Two questions:
1. bitaddress.org generates a "The site's security certificate is not trusted!" message in Chrome.  What's up with that?
2. How do you know that your cold wallet address is secure?  I mean, presumably they know they're generating cold wallets.  Then, they could guess that someone put money in it.  Then, they could get the money out if they saved those addresses.

Very generous of you!
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:07:51
Very kind of you to do that.  You *are* the karma.

Sounds a bit scammy.  Good luck with that.

I see a lot of needs.
* An idiot-proof way to store BTC as value. It seems like every other post about secure storage immediately jumps to a flash drive with Linux.  Congrats, you've just lost 99.9% of the population.
* If Bitcoin is to be seen as a payment system rather than a currency, then BitPay is providing a great service.  It needs a counterpart where BTC can be instantly purchased.  Then, because the transaction is instantly going fiat --&gt; BTC --&gt; fiat, price volatility is a non-issue.  [Honey brought up something similar  recently with Amazon](  (I recognize many here don't think that BTC is a payment system.)
* Legal help.  [One letter from a federal agency kills enthusiasm](  Businesses don't want to risk it, so there needs to be a clear guide for the legal and tax implications of Bitcoin usage.
* A directory of [green addresses](  I know anonymity is a huge feature of Bitcoin, but green addresses could go a long way in calming down the regulators.  Besides, it's going to be difficult to convert any sizeable amount of BTC to fiat without your real identity being involved, anyway.

I've been wondering about this, too.  It's going to be an interesting legal battle, regardless.  Certainly if the attacker is from somewhere without a solid rule of law, it's unlikely to ever be recovered.
Of course, I also think the Bitcoin developers would alter the code to make it more difficult to solve if it ever got to be widespread.

Most informative!  Does the "paper wallet" on Coinbase work this same way?  It seems like they want you to just hit print.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:40:14
How do I get the funds back out of the paper wallet when I want them?  Is that where the passphrase comes in?

You aren't saving your dollars hoping they increase in value.  You're saving them to spend them later.

The same way an insurance company does.  They pay out the value of it in cash.  Think about artwork.  Insurers insure it, but if a Picasso burns there is no way to create a new one. 
Good luck finding an insurer to do this, though.  There's a reason that there's no such thing as stock market insurance from an insurance company.

Doesn't Mt. Gox run through a Polish bank?
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:01:44
Thanks.  I was just wondering today if such a thing would exist.  Now, to let a little time pass to see if it's trustworthy...

It's not that it's a good thing, it's more that it's a necessary thing.  Governments don't like anonymity.  If we had a list of green addresses, similar to bank accounts being tied to real identities, I think we'd get government acceptance of Bitcoin a lot faster.
Unless Bitcoin really does take off as a currency (not a payment system), with goods and services priced in Bitcoin (and not tied to USD/EUR/other fiat), then we'll eventually need to bring those BTC to fiat.  If we don't, the businesses we buy from will.  When we convert to fiat, we (probably) are using our real identities anyway, so I don't see giving up much here.  It's more like presenting it in an organized way that the regulatory bodies won't freak out at.
What scares me is the idea that country by country, rule by rule, the regulators will shut off the supply of fiat to Bitcoin.  Imagine, just for a second, if the US said money transfer systems can't transmit to Bitcoin exchanges.  What would happen to the price?  How do we stop that from happening?  Trying to overrule the government isn't likely to work; I think presenting a nice (secure) list of real-world identities would be a nice compromise.
Popular? No. I just can't see how Bitcoin will survive regulatory threats under complete anonymity.

You might want to head over to I'd suggest learning a bit more before diving in to having a wallet.  Your request suggests you may have some more to learn.
