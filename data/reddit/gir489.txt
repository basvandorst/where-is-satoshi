Even if the network did expose this, you could get outside actors to influence internal actors. Like what USDT did to artificially inflate the price to 20K.

Ver and Co was butthurt that his proposal was shot down by the miners, so they forked off the original Bitcoin chain and created Cash in an attempt to preserve what Bitcoin was 10 months ago, because everyone just loved forever waiting on transactions and low miner payments. What's funny is that when BCC forked, it was worth about $500 a coin, and BTC was worth $2K. BCC is worth $500 again, but BTC has found support at 6K. COINCIDENCE?!

Fuck it, just go 1 gig block sizes, don't worry about the fact that there's no possible way to scale that with the miners, and that they rejected it the first time because it's a stupid idea and even Satoshi noted that the block header should fit in the minimalist of memories.

I made so much BTC off idiots on Binance from Bitcoin Diamond, it's not even funny. It's clearly a scam token! You can't withdraw or deposit BCD, there's no working source implementation and the team is anonymous. How can you fall for these?!

When it came out, yes. They even had to pass laws like the CFAA to charge computer hacker Robert Morris with a crime, as there was no such law at the time... We've also had to pass laws like the DMCA to charge computer software counterfeiters.

If you believe in Proof of Stake, then I would say instead of buying Bitcoin Green, buy Ethereum. While the switch to Casper has been hyped more than RGIII was for the Redskins, I still believe in Casper. Bitcoin Green wants to basically shit all over Satoshi's plan and give the power to the people who have the most tokens on the network, and not the miners. There can be only one Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:58:42
I mean, not really... There was so many people posting WTB/WTS ads on various forums, and also on Tor. I bought my first bitcoin from some guy with Paypal. It was the worst system ever, and they could've just ran off with the money, which is why I was excited about exchanges like Mt. Gox, where you have a trusted third party handle the exchange, but look at how that turned out... We need more decentralized exchanges based around the ZRX platform. Coinbase Pro just moved to it, and you can't even tell the difference, aside from no more fees for selling.

I grew up in the 90s, so I always envied people who were BBSing in the 80s with Commodore 64s and PC Jrs, and wanted to relive that somehow. I feel like Bitcoin gave me a second chance to do that in 2009... I felt like a pioneer on a ship sailing new seas, and the experience was amazing. Also, it's still funny to tell people that someone gave me 1,000 BTCs for something that was worth $100 8 years ago. Opportunity is out there, you just have to find it...
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:50:44
Interesting that Bitcoin would confide in Ethereum, considering the Bitcoin developers rejected Vitalik's ideas...

Hahahaha. I'd love to see you say that with BTC at $1.
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:44:58
Recently, someone told me about the forced forking of Monero. I feel like this was a huge oversight from the original bitcoin devs not to do this. If you don't force people to use it, there will always be Luddites who refuse, because "the current thing works." Monero has a great thing going for it with the 6 month forced fork cycle.

I bought BTC at 6 cents during the first ever BTC price pump which peaked at 30 cents, then fell to 22 cents. I then took my 10,000 BTC and kept it and vowed never to let that happen again. After that, I started trading little by little, and increased my position to 50,000 BTC along with several hundred thousand in excess cash. Only until August of 2017 did I start trading alts, and that position is somewhere around 70,000 BTC raw, and some 10,000 BTC in alts.
BTC is what you make of it. If you want to think of BTC as a ponzi scheme get rich quick, then go ahead. But even comparatively, I'm up 400% in raw BTC, and 10833233% in USD. So I don't know what you're talking about. This meme is 100% true. Instead of thinking 1 BTC = 6500 USD. Consider this ***CRAZY*** idea. 1 BTC = 1 BTC. ��

He has a point. Every single one of you on here has no interest in actually seeing a Bitcoin-based economy. All of you just want to buy it at a lower price, and sell it to some idiot at a higher price.

Yet again, perfect representation of why Redditors are gay. "LOL HE WAS SUCCESSFUL AND I'M NOT THEREFORE HE MUST BE LYING!" When Bitcoin falls to 0 and ETH runs to 500K, you can shove your Satoshis up your ass, kid.

Nothing. He was just a co-founder with Jobs and Wozniak. He could've just let it sit until at least 1980 when the company first went public, when the stock would've been worth $212M. That's when I would've sold. Bought back during the whole iPod thing. I didn't start investing in companies until around 2012. When the iPhone 6 was announced, I bought 100 shares at $420 each, this was before the split. They're worth about $126,700 total according to my Merrill Lynch portfolio right now. Not to mention the dividends I've been receiving over the years from them. Solid company. I also bought Nvidia 100 shares at $13 a share around the same time. That's only worth $25,000 right now, but it pays an OK dividend. Nothing has come close to the 25,000% increase I got from ETH going from $7 to $1,200 though, LOL!

Coinbase actually has 0 fees now with ACH transfer, but you still have to pay their inflated FMV price, which they even show on their site. GDAX (Coinbase's exchange) however offers a .25% maker/taker now, so if you use GDAX you can trade at FMV for .25% again.

I don't like this, even as a "big trader" of theirs, doing 100+ BTCs sell/buy orders a week. I've moved back to Coinbase in protest and taking my 2,000 BTCs and 40,000 ETH with me. This is UNACCEPTABLE behavior no matter who you are and I will not stand for it. Treating people differently based on how much money they have is how we fucking started this need for Bitcoin, and it will not be how I allow it to end. Free and open market will determine the direction of Bitcoin, and Coinbase has certainty made great strides in fee approbation since December. At the time, I didn't know about GDAX, but GDAX seems like Gemini without the bullshit. I'm loving it so far.
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:16:16
Maybe this isn't the right place to ask, but wasn't the bitcoin cash fork shot down during the August 2017 vote? Why does Ver keep shilling "BCH is the real bitcoin" then? I am confused... Appreciate the meme though.
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:05:30
I think you're also at fault for not doing research. I would never even think of sending more than 1 BTC to an exchange that people around me have told is terrible. There's no reason to even use HitBTC, they don't even offer that many pairs. Go Binance or go home, that simple.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:58:54
...You think that because someone has 50,000 USD to trade instead of $500, that makes them smarter? Just means they have more money. I know several whales that do over 5000 BTC of transactions a day, they're dumb as a rock. One dude asked me what the difference between maker and taker was... They just have money, not necessarily more intelligence... I'd wager to say that their larger transaction orders get MORE support tickets due to discrepancies in orders. They just make more money off them.
And who cares about social media rants? It's free advertising, good or bad...

You got $40 more than you would've had you not sold on that stupid platform, unless you kept your BTC in a local wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:43:36
They’re basically saying fuck you to small volume buyers. The fee is the same, block trading just helps you get in on large orders. They’re done with these peanut orders. Go to Coinbase if you do less than 10,000 USD of trades a week. Even then probably still go to Coinbase. Gemini’s fee schedule is bullshit. They lured in customers with low fees now that they have a huge customer base and the market is taking a tumble, they pump the fees.
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:11:25
A lot of people I know who have 1M+ in assets are dumb as a rock, they either were trust fund babbies, their daddy pays for everything, they got in to Bitcoin when I did (2010) or they made it big at stock trading. All of them are luck based in my opinion. I was lucky that I happened to be working with the FBI at the time and we discovered a child pornography ring that was using Bitcoin to pay each other. But that's just my experience. I've seen people as smart as Warren Buffet make stupid decisions even ignoring his own advice. "Never buy a stock in a company you like" and he bought BIG in to IBM!!! A stupid decision that cost him billions, and his rebuttal was "I like them." ��

I agree! Originally I was hoping Ethereum would fix all the issues with Bitcoin, but as Ethereum progressed and promised lots of things and failed to even deliver a testnet for PoS and sharding, I'm thinking Bitcoin truly is the future. But it's all speculation at this point. Lightning network looks promising.
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:10:18
That's fair. He has a sizeable Bitcoin investment, I guess he just wants his free scam token to increase in value so he can buy more BTC. Honestly, that's exactly what I did when BCH hit 3K from the Coinbase scam pump... I sold all my BCH for BTC...

That's actually how we charged them with conspiracy. We were just investigating one guy that we picked up, turned out it was a whole ring of them. We didn't know until we searched his computer, and we had to explain to the judge what Bitcoin was and how the ledger works.

@_date: 2018-04-27 23:14:08
I've seen this argument, and Richard Heart destroys this as an argument from authority. Satoshi and the original core devs stepped away from Bitcoin because they didn't want to become the thing they wanted to stop. They wanted the entire Bitcoin community to vote with their CPU (EVEN SAYS THAT IN THE ORIGINAL PAPER, VER!!!) and not their power... But as Heart describes, you're going to create two communities, and both are going to fight for control with power and influence, with both saying they're the real bitcoin... Honestly, people just have to be smart about this. The whole reason we needed crypto in the first place is we can't trust humans in power, we have to trust a system, I feel that's why Satoshi wanted to stay anonymous and why he's disappeared. He wanted people to focus on Bitcoin and not the name. But that's ironically exactly what we've done, even naming a unit of Bitcoin after him... The cycle repeats...
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:06:56
Basically it started with BIP 91 and the distaste for SegWit. To maintain purity, Ver determined the only way to preserve Satoshi's dream was to fork and create Bitcoin Cash. But for some **STUPID** reason, BCH believes you can solve all of Bitcoin's problems by bumping the block size to 8MB. They're stupid in this front, as we've seen in December and November and in previous years with high volume bitcoin, the network can't handle the sheer volume required. For S&amp;G I bought 4 BCH (peanuts to me) and sent it to a friend just to see how long it would take. It took an hour. WILDLY different than the "few minutes" claimed by Bitcoin Cash. They have less miners and even less volume than Bitcoin. The Bitcoin community voted to go with SegWit, and we're gonna do it. It's our only hope for Bitcoin to scale. (That and Lightning Network...)
