I understand the concept of buy and sell walls and it pretty much applies to other asset classes as well. Having said that, the price of the underlying security (or crypto-currency) would almost always move a little bit based on the amount of load on each side of the balance. If there are more sell orders at the current price, then some of them will be matched and the price goes down a little so that the buys can compensate for them. 
What I don't understand is why has this just surfaced in the past few days? Something had to have changed since it's fairly apparent from the trend.

They're usually around $3.5 at the moment. Having said that, GDAX's BTC and ETH transfers have been dreadfully slow these past few days.

How do I do that?

Trezor has been good for me! Really good and intuitive interface.

Nah, you're good. I've been tracking the price and trying to design an algorithm that would allow me to trade automatically. Buy low, sell high. I just want to understand the details of why something that interesting is going unnoticed. I'm sure there's an explanation, I just haven't found it yet.

More importantly, it's easier to keep track of human-readable words rather than remembering a long list of hex characters. Also, the fact you're duplicating the private keys on multiple thumb drives entirely defeats the purpose of securing your private keys as you're basically increasing the chances of them being stolen if they're unencrypted. 
You should read BIP-32, BIP-39 and BIP-44. Really fascinating pieces of technological implementations of crypto in my opinion!
