They all are fake encrypted wallets. There is nothing he could test out...

1) The attacker does not know how many bitcoins there are. How can he ask to send all the bitcoins to a certain address? Could you ask me to do so? I would play along and send the attacker only a part of what I have...
2) Truecrypt: the attacker could detect the presence of truecrypt and torture all the passwords out. He would even start from the assumption that everyone of your drives has a hidden section and torture you a bit more.
3) If he sees 1000 encrypted wallets and knows you have a tool to generate them randomly... how can he know which ones are the real ones? He would torture you and you would have to give up some... but he would NEVER be certain to have the password to all your bitcoins

If there is just one encrypted wallet, the attacker KNOWS you have your bitcoins in there. He would then torture you into oblivion, possibly harming your family and friends too.
If there are thousands and a tool to generate new ones, the attacker would stop torturing at the point he believes you gave him everything. The chance is he will stop torturing you earlier, probably sparing your family and possibly (depending how credible you are) leaving you one or two wallets...

But that's exactly the point: you can't! 
The tool generates thousands of randomly encrypted wallets! You don't have the password, nobody does. You could not decrypt them even under torture!
And the attacker knows that by looking at the tool... Thus after a while he would have to beleive you.

Not all wallets are fake, only some! The thing is, the attacker does NOT know if all are fake, if only some are fake... or what the hell all those wallets are. Maybe one of them holds the life savings, maybe two, maybe none. The owner has plausible deniability in that he can plausibly hold that none of those wallets are real. Maybe some are. Maybe none. The mere presence of the tool creates this confusion.
The attacker can take all wallets, they are encrypted anyways.

Well, truecrypt allows only for ONE hidden volume. 
It is plausible that in a few years it is possible to detect (through some statistical anomalies) the presence of the hidden volume. It is quite clunky to have to replace / update your hidden drives constantly as soon as a new truecrypt version comes out...
Many go as far as having a hidden volume containing a message "I have nothing in the hidden volume". This to be able to PROVE you have nothing hidden and avoid unnecessary persecution, fines or even torture.
