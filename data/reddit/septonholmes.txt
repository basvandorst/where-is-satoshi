There it is
@_date: 2016-04-11 19:52:57
If it drove just a little more sales, or occupied just a little less time, I'd keep at it.  It's just to fast paced with this particular business
@_date: 2016-04-12 08:48:12
thank you for this. I had never seen it before
@_date: 2016-04-12 16:18:24
zero fraud, but very small sample size, only 6 transactions were butcoin out of about 1,000 total
@_date: 2016-03-06 20:05:52
Ha!, awesome
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:31:10
Ha! Yeah, you're probably right.  Won't be much of a hassle if no one does it, so that's a win...
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:15:48
Thanks, and yeah I do know what you mean.  But to be honest, I've spent the whole day today trying to figure out how any payment partner would make it faster, safer, or easier, and I'm not coming up with alot.  There are some neat features that would help a restaurant, or a website...but with my simple little food stand...no one has sold me yet on faster, safer, or easier.  I'm going to keep looking, but if you have any experience I appreciate hearing about it
ETA: I should mention that the system I described above, is pretty much what my order system is already, except the customer is prepaying themselves instead of giving card/cash at the register.  It might sound cumbersome to read, but it's really pretty fast in practice
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:30:12
See comment above.  Yup, you could probably get away with it, consequence free, 4$ in free food.  Would you?  Why or why not - no judgement from me just wondering.
@_date: 2016-02-29 19:46:17
I'm in a big city too.  One weekend of a concerted effort to scam wouldn't kill the business, but it would kill the bitcoin program.  I imagine that if bad transactions ever went up in a short amount of time, I'd just shut it down in an hour when I saw transactions weren't going thru at a higher rate.
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:16:41
Agreed.  This situation it would be easier to 'dine and dash', but it would cost  me much less, only like 4$ an instance
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:56:27
Thanks, just read up on it.  Would happily eat the fee for the benefit of ensuring it doesn't get backlogged
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:25:45
Most wallets handle fees automatically right?  Human nature question, do you think it would be helpful to post a miner fee reminder, or would that just confuse people, or remind them that no fee might mean free food....
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:14:49
I see how easy it would be - and realistically there are pretty much 0 consequences for you.  Your food would be eaten and you'd be on the other side of the park before I could notice.  With that in mind, would you scam the 4$? Would your friends, people you know? Why or why not?
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:05:08
Cared enough to comment, and I appreciate it.
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:02:31
Cool man, maybe you're right.  Thanks for the heads up on the possibility, if I do it I'll have to try and mitigate the risk. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:24:15
I'm working my google, but can you explain a little more checking previous inputs when you have a minute?  Thank you
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:28:27
I think you are right, the last factor is that I don't want to spend alot of time with customer service on this.  I track my interactions per minute, and lines are always long.  Long interactions = less sales
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:15:54
I'm going to google, but could you elaborate when you have a minute?  Thanks
@_date: 2016-02-29 19:43:46
Thanks for the link, have you used it?  I'm not seeing the benefit of a POS app over just giving out a QR code to a wallet
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:46:46
Thanks for the link, reading now
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:19:18
Awesome everyone, thanks for helping.  Anyone actually done this?  Everything on my menu is the same price, so I'm not sure I see a reason not to just post a QR code for a wallet address and let them send it that way, instead of using a merchant service for it.
@_date: 2016-02-29 19:52:25
I hear ya', but I would know after the first transaction where someone claims to have sent, but I don't see it.  Also I can see the menu board from my table, and you're surrounded by people.  Might work as a scam, but only for 1 transaction
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:22:59
I almost certainly will! I live in a large metro-US area, so in a few months when we get up and running I'll update in somekind of non-self promotional way
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:52:11
Take a picture, use the power of shame? I think a human nature solution far outweighs a technical solution.  And a certain tolerance for loss...
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:00:32
Thanks for the link, reading now
@_date: 2016-02-29 19:41:35
Ha! This isn't speculative conversation, but a real world application with real world results...so the free brainstorming and opinions are only appreciated on my end. I have been reading and digging as deep as I can the last 6 months...but I'm a chef, not a dev. Appreciative upvote from me.
@_date: 2016-02-29 19:24:25
Wasn't really being serious.  Market value of shame? I don't know, if you're a jerk you probably don't care if your picture is up on a wall of shame.  If you are a part of a steady community it may not be worth 4$ to have to face identified as a thief.  Again tho, I don't have time for that.  I've got a queue of 30 people waiting in line to order food.  If i get scammed or someone doesn't add a fee...reality is it's just lost, I think, and I can be ok with that and do it, or not and don't.
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:27:03
I think so...again, I don't expect it to be much volume, and at 4$ a transaction I could lose a couple if it also helps me stand out a bit from the crowd. ("oh this guy takes internet money? Let's see what that's all about...")
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:20:54
I guess it could get confusing if I have several transaction going on at the same time...
@_date: 2016-10-01 20:55:38
Thanks for clarifying! It reads strangely with listing selling price above, and then fee structure below but I understand what you mean. Incidentally I drove out to Flatbush to try one out last night and couldn't get it to read my new york id. Ill try again at some point. Best to you
@_date: 2016-10-01 06:17:33
Wait, am I reading it wrong or are you charging 100$ over exchange rate plus the 12% fee (current exchange 614, buy-rate is 714 + tiered fee?). Sorry if I'm misunderstanding, I've never used your service before, and found this conversation via google.
@_date: 2016-10-01 06:18:34
Because that would be 20%+...
