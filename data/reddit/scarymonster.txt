...Any that aren't as bad as Twitch chat?

Soo... Like a bank? Sorry, I just had to..
Realistically, I don't think merchants accepting BTC will lose any more money from fraudulent BTC payments than they do with current credit/debit card fees, charge-backs, and counterfeit.

1) Take preorders to build first batch of miners
2) Start mining using said miners
3) Don't ship unit till it has mined enough btc to pay for itself + 2 more units
4) Repeat

You can't really give that comparison of CAN to USD whenever these are both global currencies (just like gold and silver).

So I take it you haven't seen the video about bitcoins that ebay made and blogged about?

Yep. Seems like we're in the minority here, but I am against this change. You don't see the price of gold being listed at 1/10 of an ounce.

Well I'm sure the DDOS was &gt; 1gbps. That's probably just the port being completely saturated.

I don't believe for a second this guy's story is true.

But this hearing isn't about the USD. Besides, I'm pretty sure they don't need to be reminded.

Same, I know at least 2 people whose companies were affected by the recent fake customer complaint email.. Dun &amp; Bradstreet if i remember correctly.
I can't believe people are still opening unsolicited email attachments.

I've sold 2 items on there. One physical and one digital. Both transactions went fine. Just like anything else online, communicate with the other person and usually everything will go smoothly.

It's funny because this is exactly what was said about bitcoin a few years ago.

I've been using Chase QuickPay for a while, and it does work ok most of the time. A few weeks ago I tried sending my brother a few hundred, and it ended up getting flagged as suspicious. I had to call them to release the funds and it ended up taking almost a whole day to transfer the funds.

Just curious, how did she react? :)
@_date: 2013-10-19 13:21:27
Right, and gold exchange rate should be measured in grams instead of ounces because "it's too expensive" otherwise?
@_date: 2013-02-04 19:55:48
Why not just call?
