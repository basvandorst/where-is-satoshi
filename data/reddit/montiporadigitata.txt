We shouldn't jump on Mozilla to hard. They did a simple test and have raised "only" $5k in Bitcoin. That amount is pretty small in the grand scheme of things and prob not worth the time/effort to do further tests. It is really up to us at this point to donate enough to *make* it worth their time/resources.
But the reason I was being downvoted is because loves to brigade and vote with multiple accounts.

He is asking if they can "track" them if you use a mixer in which there wouldn't be a direct link. IE you send Bitcoin to address A and get sent the amount from address B and C to address D which you control.
While feasible, it is very unlikely that they'll be able to track all that. So the answer to his question is no.
BUT coinbase could continue tracking the "original" coin you sent to the mixer and blame you for whatever happens.

I'm pretty "Dude McLongBone" has donated to them a couple times already.

Oh sweet jesus. You poor, poor child.
@_date: 2014-12-12 04:47:53
Why not? I've used a couple stores that use one static address and then just check the transaction manually.  Obviously, that's not a solution for very busy stores, but it is an option!

Electrum has always been and will continue to be a joke. Dogecoin seems serious in comparison.

I can't remember the details exactly, but it was somehow determined that his bids were all so low that it wasn't even feasible that he'd even come close to even thinking that he might be almost able to win. Something like $100 a coin when they were still at $600.

Unlike most people here, I am on the political left.  I do not like being forced to pay multi-billion dollar companies everytime I try to spend money online or send money to another country.  Bitcoin gives us the option of using our own money without some rich d-hole taking a slice without any say in the matter.

Replace "his" with "his syndicate". Most people would able to put two and two together, but it's ok, I'l hold your hand and do the thinking for you.

In theory. The graph shows that the version with "Donate with Bitcoin" had just over 100k visitors and nearly $90k in donations where as the non-Bitcoin version had 52K visitors and $47k in donations.
What this means is that people who ended up on the Bitcoin page donated, on average, 7 cents less than people who got the non-Bitcoin page.  
This was randomized so there was no way someone could "choose" to go to the Bitcoin or non-Bitcoin page.
Mozilla is interpreting this as people see a tiny little link that says Bitcoin and, for some reason, go "NOPE BYE BYE AHHHH!".  Mozilla doesn't care at this point *why* they nope out.
I think the result is because the page says "Donate with Bitcoin" and nothing else and some people are thinking it means they are on a Bitcoin *only* page somehow.  I, obviously, do not have any data yet to prove this. Just my hypothesis.
@_date: 2014-12-08 23:30:14
Because the good folks at Buttcoin have deemed it so!
But seriously, don't waste your time on them.  They all pile in and upvote themselves anyways then turn around and say that we're a hivemind community or something.

I like how you are trying to tell the community what the community should talk about.  Not much different then the bully cops in the video.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:25:31
Your logic is very tortured.
Denominations *mean nothing*. That's why we're using bits. The whole decimal point arguments for Dogecoins is worthless.
Also, tipping someone a fraction of dogecoin is a thousand times worse than tipping with a fraction of a Bitcoin. "Oh goody, someone tipped me a penny of money that can't be used anywhere and is obsessed over by children who laugh at old memes. Just great..."
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:44:16
I agree. We should not be pushing everyone under the sun to accept BTC if we're only going to donate a single bit one time and think we're good.  We are a tiny community still and we should act like it more often.
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:56:59

@_date: 2014-12-08 21:08:15
This mos def requires more data. It makes no sense that the simple presence of a tiny link would suddenly turn $140k worth of people away.  
Assuming the effect is real my hypotheses is that people go to the page, see the "donate with bitcoin", assume they're on some Bitcoin only page, and leave to try to find a different donation page.
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:55:38
If I want to send $10 on the opposite side of the world I can instantly for free with Bitcoin. If I wanted to go through Western Union or some other remittance service they'd be lucky to get 50% of that due to fees.
Credit card companies and such take a percent of sales.  You might not realize it when you buy a soda that the convenience store because said companies prohibit the store from charging you directly. Instead, the store has to raise their prices to cover the fee and thus you pay indirectly.
There are some merchants that do offer discounts for using Bitcoin, but at this point they are a minority.

So, let's say I put "on the blockchain" that I own all of Paris. Obviously, that is not so as I do not, in fact, own all of Paris even though the claim is "verifiable by math".  
How is this different?  I mean, maybe I'll just go upload a document right now saying I own all of the coastline in Honduras.  
I mean, I get the problem that they are trying to solve, but so far I don't see how throwing buzz words at said problem is going to solve anything. 
Just tryin' to understand here.  It would be really great if we could solve the issue.
@_date: 2015-05-15 21:28:40
Just to be sure I get it, the goal would be that multiple independent parties have a sort of "master database" and all look at the blockchain together?
That makes sense to me.  I can see why you wouldn't want to do a straight up coloredcoin because then you'd run into the issue where if someone lost private keys to a chunk of land it'd be a mess.
Thanks for clearing it up.  Was interested in how this would work and I feel like I get it now.

I think that if they have the cash to see the stamp that means that cash is better for whatever they are doing at that moment. When Bitcoin actually becomes better then they won't need to cash to see the stamp.
A while back I went to a local Bitcoin meetup that was at a restaurant that took Bitcoin.  There was a decent amount of people and of course most were diehard libertarians who trash-talked USD and how it was worthless etc etc.  Of course, at end of the night 90% of them paid with that same cash they said was worthless just a few minutes prior instead of Bitcoin.  I, as the lone liberal, was one of two that paid with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-15 20:31:17
So, the blockchain version will just be used as verification of sorts for the government version of the data base?
The other question I have would be how are records tracked on the blockchain? I assume there must be some sort of database keeping track of which hashes go to what record, ect.  What would prevent someone from deleting the record that points to the appropriate hash on the blockchain and, thus, making the whole thing moot?

You haven't been on the subreddit to long then.
I will say it has gotten better, but most of the replies to my original comment highlight the anti-women perception that many guys here harbor.  It's not always outright hostility and more subtle, but it's there.
@_date: 2015-02-25 21:03:21
The reason that there are so few women involved in Bitcoin is the same reason there are so women involved in much of the tech industry.  There are enough asshole men who make involvement thoroughly unpleasant for women and enough men who act like these asshole's aren't that big a deal and women are just "overreacting".
Of *course* there will be some women who find ways of dealing with it and preserve, but we shouldn't settle on that being good enough.
But the reason is certianly *not* that Bitcoin is "spooky scary" to women some how.
