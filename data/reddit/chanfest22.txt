In the US, the IRS has not released any specific guidance for capital gains calculation methods for cryptocurrency transactions (e.g. FIFO, LIFO, etc.). They have however released [Publication 550]( about stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. This states that there are two options for calculating capital gains: first-in first-out (FIFO) and specific identification. That's it.
The simplest and most conservative method is FIFO. FIFO means that the first coin that you purchase (chronologically) is the first coin counted for a sale.
With specific identification, you identify exactly which coin is being spent at transaction time. This can be ad-hoc or according to a pattern (e.g. last-in-first-out \[LIFO\]).
Note however that with specific identification, you must specify to your broker/exchange, **at the time of the exchange**, which specific stocks (or in this case coins) you are selling/trading. Notably, this cannot be done retroactively and you must receive written confirmation from the broker/exchange that they transacted the specific coins you identified in order for specific identification to be applied.
More details [here](
**t;l;dr** — [amend]( your returns to file your taxes for previous years regardless of which method you choose. Go with FIFO if you want to play it safe. If you go with HIFO/LIFO you will likely end up with lower taxes, but you are taking more risk in the event that the IRS decides to reject this designation in the future.

Right, but a few things to keep in mind:
* The 8949 also includes when you got the asset and when you disposed of it (if there are multiple disposals, it is clear if they are happening in FIFO or LIFO order)
* Tax authorities can also get access to your transaction history from KYC exchanges like Coinbase/Gemini/etc. or via 1099-K forms that they issue. If what you are reporting doesn't seem to match with what is coming from the exchanges, then you can get audited and have the burden of proving you are accounting correctly

LIFO is a subset of specific identification. More details on the associated risks [**here**](

Based on your previous tax filing (specifically Form 8949). It shows your cost basis for your disposals so it would become clear if older coins are being disposed first or newer ones. If anything is unclear, an audit would place the burden of showing the full transaction history record on you (not on the IRS).

The cost basis method you can use varies from country to country. In the US, the IRS has not released any specific guidance for capital gains calculation methods for cryptocurrency transactions. They have however released [Publication 550]( about stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. If we apply this guidance to cryptocurrency, it states that there are two options for calculating capital gains: first-in first-out (FIFO) and specific identification. The simplest and most conservative method is FIFO, which is what software filing services like [CoinTracker]( provide by default.
Note however that with specific identification, you must specify to your broker/exchange, **at the time of the exchange**, which specific stocks (or in this case coins) you are selling/trading. Notably, this cannot be done retroactively and you must receive written confirmation from the broker/exchange that they transacted the specific coins you identified in order for specific identification to be applied. Some more aggressive taxpayers or CPAs may push this method because this is all a grey area and specific ID can lead to optimal tax outcomes, but note the additional risk you are taking on.
In other (non-US) countries:
* Australia: the [ATO requires]( specific identification when possible, otherwise FIFO
* Canada: [the CRA requires]( using Adjusted Cost Base (ACB)
* Germany: follows the same rules as the USA
* UK: follows sharepooling, described [here](

As everyone else on this thread has pointed out, if you try to evade the IRS, especially at huge volumes like 10M, you are signing up for a lot of unnecessary risk. The IRS has already [subpoenaed]( Coinbase and exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini already send 1099s to the IRS showing your aggregate trade volume. If they then detect that you didn't declare any cryptocurrency taxes, that significantly increases the chance of an audit, and associated penalties, fees, and punishments.
Have you considered looking at some cryptocurrency tax software like [CoinTracker]( which would quickly automate this tax calculation process for you (note: I work on CoinTracker)?

If only there were a service to automagically convert your paycheck into crypto based on the amount you are paid and your expenses for that month ...

Right now a lot of people are dumping altcoins to buy BTC with the hope that they will get "free money" post-fork with their newly minted BTC2X. Therefore some would argue that the current price of BTC is inflated and the current price of altcoins is low. One potential strategy to take advantage of this would be to buy whichever altcoins you like anytime between today and the fork date.
