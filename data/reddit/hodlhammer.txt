I use the blue wallet and have lighting on there, but I am still confused as to how to fill my lightning wallet with btc and then transfer

I have always viewed bcash as a scam but why is it a scam if it is also decentralized and it solves the bigger block issue that satoshi wanted to expand.
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:13:38
I hope not satoshi
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:55:12
Please stop

I don’t like being notified of a huge drop in price from this meme every time.
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:38:43
Yes please inform me. No coin shilling here.

Cash app is the fastest. Download app link your bank/debit card buy the bitcoin and then have your buddy do the same get cash app set up a bitcoin wallet (remember the keys) and then send it on the cashapp to him
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:45:49
It says buy bitcoin as an option
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:14:06
Why post this?
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:22:15
Yea there is
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:16:02
To be fair this subreddit is also heavily censored.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:03:09
There will always be a 1%. People who are in btc now will be higher class then people not in now if btc takes off. I don’t think there is much you can do
@_date: 2019-08-27 15:06:27
Blue wallet is easy
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:23:24
Yes it’s a sly way to trick people, but still people on this sub should be allowed to ask a question such as “why is bitcoin better than bcash” without it being taken down. Both pages censor material so we can’t point the finger at them.
@_date: 2019-08-13 14:48:26
Get a ledger it’s very easy. Literally only has 2 buttons on it.
@_date: 2019-08-20 13:29:45
It’s CW! Clearly.....
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:30:24
Same ! What do you think is going on?
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:56:06
@_date: 2019-10-05 22:24:03
No sell your bags now
@_date: 2019-08-29 03:06:24
You can buy instantly like on a dip. It’s because the banks take a while to transfer the money. On coinbase I’m guessing your using debit or credit card.

I would not use robinhood. Use Gemini that’s what I like for just DCA
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:50:45
I am going to put my QR code on a T-shirt
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:44:15
Thanks! How do I get these into a wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:19:05
We are not seeing to much new money from new people coming into the market right now. Most money coming into bitcoin is being transferred from alts. Last time a lot of newbs got screwed by people who had been in the market. I don’t think that many new people have entered since it has not been on the news and such like 2017.
@_date: 2019-08-29 22:34:58
Yea I think cashapp is
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:33:56
Exactly I have told friends for a while also. Not sub 100$ but still, I know exactly what you mean.
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:28:10
Wouldn’t call you either. I think you will be in profit but I don’t think we will be close to 16k
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:46:18
Define stonks please

This is the content we need
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:26:13
How sure how to get them in a wallet ... thank you tho !
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:52:19
Don’t think so but I sure do hope so
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:03:06
Nobody in there right mind would be selling a bitcoin for 4k.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:24:11
His 24 word seed code
@_date: 2019-10-30 13:29:03
Nobody knows why they get filled... they just .. do
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:44:56
It was an analogy that you clearly understood. Seems like it did it’s job.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:21:54
Something fun. Help to promote and spread awareness.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:02:03
Don’t want to put the wrong QR on my shirt
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:49:00
I tried sending some btc to a blue wallet and then doing that but could not get things to go through.
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:15:27
I have a lighting wallet already set up on blue wallet
@_date: 2019-12-07 16:37:56
You would have to pay tax on the 1000$ cashed out
@_date: 2019-12-12 15:43:48
I thought Germany banks were just allowed to store crypto for customers. Could be wrong but yea there will always be 3rd party’s for people who can’t hold their own
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:46:48
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:51:42
People are taking profits. Nothing wrong with that. Enjoy the ride
@_date: 2019-12-08 18:53:28
Holding a little bitcoin is better than none
@_date: 2019-12-05 15:35:26
Doesn’t really matter I think because the bitcoins that are in circulation can just be cut down into smaller pieces
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:58:32
Does anyone have a good quality answer to OPs question
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:57:32
Don’t think it’s decentralized
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:29:11
Solid question haven’t seen a great answer for
@_date: 2019-09-23 03:12:31
@_date: 2019-09-23 03:14:09
No you crazy
@_date: 2019-05-31 03:02:03
It may have affected the price but I think BTC was due for a little correction. I guess we will see if that was it or not. Just another reminder to never leave your coins on an exchange.
@_date: 2019-05-31 03:48:31
I like ledger other people prefer trezor
