So you recommend tax evasion? Great. Real happy with this community.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:35:19
But how will this be different than credit card companies charging fees?
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:30:53
Bitcoin is garbage. 
Wow. Bitcoin is like a conglomerate of doom's day folks, and conspiracy theorists. This is the biggest circle jerk ever.

Damn you just got 9 downvotes. dumb ass

Lol. Definitely not true unless you have your own utopian country!
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:19:29
My dollars are the same in all respect except for deflation. However, my wages are paid in dollars, which every year my company adjusts for inflation and we get a nice boost. So my dollars next year aren't worth less.
My dollars this year go into an investment account and are actually worth more.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:24:48
But if the recipient needs local currency they end up being charged an exchange rate fee, along with a possible tax on the realized gain.
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:27:00
Yes, this is the most embarrassing post ever. Why did he receive the gold? I feel like this community has drank too much of the juice.
It went from possible mainstream adoption to a small percentage who believe they are entitled to evade taxes.
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:59:07
Even so, use my example above but replace American with Mexican. Why would I want to deal with fees on both ends to use another currency?
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:12:42
Why are you downvoting me? I didn't mean to cause for that.
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:16:35
Couldn't Bitcoin become centralized overnight? A billionaire could buy up the majority of all Bitcoins. 
(US$ 450) * 11 000 000 =
4.95 billion US$
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:56:04
Because there has to a be a middleman. The middleman will take a fee. This will happen no matter what. You are moving BTC to dollars. There has to be an exchange. There has be a third party.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:29:28
Why is this such a big deal? Won't Bitcoin price fluctuations stabilize over time? If they did the taxes would be minimal. Say I bought it, and it was worth $1000, then I sold it later for $1002.

How is bitcoin not in a short term experimental phase? It certainly isn't a stable long term investment.

@_date: 2014-04-08 00:49:11
Thank you. However, I have a funny feeling that any savings a business encounters with Bitcoin will be passed onto their bottom line.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:44:06
Thanks for down voting just because you disagree. Even if you want to use your Bitcoins with a company who accepts Bitcoin they sooner or later want to convert to stable currency. A currency they can use to pay their debts, taxes, and rent.
Sorry,  but just because exchanges are not a part of the Bitcoin system doesn't mean that dollars aren't a part of the Bitcoin system.
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:38:43
This isn't following what the essence of the law was going for. You can't just use a loophole this simple to avoid FIFO treatment.

@_date: 2014-04-08 00:22:55
If I travel a lot I don't want my money sitting inside a currency that could lose 50% of it's value night. That could truly devastate my travel plans...
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:52:54
So we are willing to accept "handy" at this point? I thought we wanted a currency free of transaction costs.
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:55:03
I understand. How do I know my Bitcoins won't be worth even less than 2% by next year? That's quite possible.
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:07:38
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:12:07
USD &gt;  BTC &gt; USD is how every transaction works for consumer to business. USD to BTC to spend BTC for consumer. Company must convert to USD to reduce risk of fluctuation of value, and to buy more supplies in USD.
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:09:25
Are you stupid?
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:56:06
This guy is a moron. Look at his other post.

This guy can't affect the market like that though.
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:42:40
Yes, it would apply to you. It is income.
They probably won't. For now.
$3,000 limit/year
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:15:04
The savings couldn't be greater than the actual fees, which are usually 2-3%. I get back most of those fees through rewards programs through my credit cards such as cash back, air miles, and many others. Sometimes I even get back more than a 2-3% benefit of using my credit card.
Don't see the point.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:23:32
Could you please address the question?

@_date: 2014-04-08 00:25:52
I understand that there is a more than just the US. What I don't get is how even someone living in Europe would benefit because there are Euros on both sides of the transaction. There will be exchange rate fees.
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:57:19

I don't have to worry if I might lose 50% of it's value in one day like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:25:22
Oh my god dude. Get off your high horse. There is no way this community could put a dent in the music and movie industry, let alone the Treasury and federal reserve.

Why does the community feel entitled to evade taxes that we all normally pay for similar transactions?

lol. i win
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:00:32
But my salary is tied to inflation.
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:29:02
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:01:39
But even when I can spend BTC anywhere, someone is going to foot the bill of the exchange. There is no truly possible way to have transactions with zero costs. Even with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:33:31
It's called a fucking wire transfer
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:42:09
So there will be a middleman with the ATM (bank) and Cryptex to receive my Bitcoin in cash. Cryptex will receive a percentage based fee from the exchange between BTC and cash. ATM (bank) will charge a $2-5 fee to remove cash from their ATM.
This is in no way, shape, or form, any better than using dollars. It also seems to be more costly.
Not only that, but you got to risk the value of your Bitcoins fluctuating negatively between the time you receive Bitcoin and the time you spend Bitcoin/convert to cash.
Also, in order to convert my dollars to Bitcoin there will be a percentage based fee on that end with another exchange.
In summary, I am charged a fee converting dollars to BTC. I am charged a fee convert my BTC to dollars. I am charged a fee to withdraw my newly converted dollars.
I am charged a tax if my BTC happens to appreciate. I take a loss, and am financially in a worse off position if my BTC decreases in value from the time of investment to purchase/exchange to dollars.
When dealing with BTC, I must inherit the risk of losing a great deal of my value in a short period of time. This something that I normally wouldn't have to deal with while using my dollars. 
Could someone please explain to me why this is better than using my dollars? It is stable, and there are less fees.
*Since Cryptex does not charge for its card or the shipping, it makes its profits like a money transmitter on the exchange rate. It’ll likely be cheaper for bitcoin enthusiasts to just sell their coins on the market and receive the cash back into their bank accounts rather than placing it onto a debit card.*

I can't spend this bullshit bitcoin. I can't pay my mortgage with this. I can't pay taxes.
There is cash on both sides of the transaction.

@_date: 2014-04-08 00:26:57
Yes, that's the exact problem. Dollars are required for tax debts, mortgages, and many other things. Dollars will always be on either side of the transaction. 
If there are exchanges between two currencies then there will be fees.

Bitcoin is done.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:39:04
I understand, but they probably work someplace where they are easily replaceable, and provide little real value.
How would Bitcoin solve this? As a company, I can do the same exact thing to my workers when paying with Bitcoin and it would result in the same. Every year, because Bitcoin is increasing in value so much, I don't have to pay you 50k this year. I just need to pay you 48.8k this year to keep up with the market rate. Next year it is 47.6k, and the next 45k.
Essentially it is different means to the same ends. I don't get how Bitcoin can't be used to take advantage of people in the same way the dollar is. Sooner or later, billionaires will own most of the Bitcoins and be able to dictate what they want.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:46:51
