Why not pay someone to make a bitcoin Monopoly-style game and manufacture it? I'm pretty sure that people will go crazy over that stuff. Problem is that it might infringe copyright laws...
3D section on the pirate bay if the law comes over?

I think It'd be better if he also had a space ship and space suit.

The buy with bitcoin feature had been around for ages.
What's changed?

Is there any way for you US citizens to inform the patent office regarding this and Bitcoin/Crypto-currencies?
Please,  I beg you. Let them know of this or else they'll potentially kill one of bitcoins greatest features.

Someone needs to throw these guys some emails.
I'll try to let them know about bitcoin and the technology.
As the user below me said, bitcoin ATMs could be the solution.

Any evidence that this is not a scam? You avoid showing me a sample PHYSICAL card that you printed. I haven't heard anyone else speak of this card and this looks like a scam.
Can you prove to me that this isn't actually a scam or not. You've avoided my questions twice. Don't avoid it again.
Can you show me that you actually have a REAL card. One that's already printed. Sample or details covered up, I don't care. I expect a reply or else I'm going to go places and list this as very suspicious and potentially a scam.

What I asked was if you could post a link to the picture of a physical, printed/manufactured card as proof that these cards are real and not just a scam.
So could you take a picture of a card that has been made (sample, info blurred out, etc) as proof that these cards are actually real.
I don't care about the design as long as there actually is a card.

I think Australian Uranium would sell nicely. You'd be on the news everywhere being promoted!

Any pictures of the physical card? And yes, the exchange rate is quite high there.
Quite a good idea, though.

I'd like to thank you for releasing this information here. I was planning to open up a student savings account with either Comm. bank or NAB.
You just made life a whole lot easier.
