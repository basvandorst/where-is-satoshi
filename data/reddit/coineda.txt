What do you know now about Bitcoin that you didn't know at the beginning of your journey? And about life?

Guys, go try the app, come back and provide feedback. The worst that could happen is that you'd be giving an informed opinion.
See you in the market!

This is Bitcoin, man, not a country club.
I participate if I get a tangible profit. 
It is my participation, together with cryptography, that makes it "tamper proof".

Even if banks and organizations developing products for banks pay much bigger wages?

"product" (note the apostrophes) as in "database entries". Doesn't it get across properly? Any suggestions?

"Absolutes are almost always wrong". I like that.
In that sense, and to further clarify my point:
¿Will private blockchains drive some sort of innovation? Could be.
¿Will those private blockchains "change the world" (as in The Economist's cover)? Most certainly not, in my opinion. That's Bitcoin's territory.
Depends on how high of a standard you put "changing the world" on, I guess. Someone could argue that taking a dump in your front yard is also "changing the world".

A lot of human capital might be driven to developing these private blockchains, though.
Clever minds that could be working on the real thing. That's why it is important for all to understand, and for those who do to help others understand, and to incentivize.
But in the end, yes, things will get in place.
@_date: 2015-10-30 20:01:16
Yeah, that's it! Thanks for pointing it out, I'm fixing it.
@_date: 2015-10-30 14:37:34
That's the thing: you (or banks) can probably do some or all of that. But The Economist's cover reads "…change the world" and, in my opinion and as I stated in this piece:
"...the real change will not come from someone’s private or semi-private (or also completely public, we already tried altcoins) “shared database”, but from THE “shared database”, THE Blockchain, (THE) Bitcoin."
From those who wouldn't want to use the *current* bank system for *whatever* reasons. 
¿Small?  We'll see.
¿Unscalable? We'll see.

Interesting thought to bring up. 
Seems like a constant centralization vs. decentralization battle, in different settings as new technologies emerge.
@_date: 2015-10-30 20:05:07
Yeah, maybe too much for one serving.
That in itself would deserve its own piece, and I went a little poetic in there.
I'm keeping it though, in the hope that it doesn't distract from the piece's main point, and that you read through all of it.
@_date: 2015-10-30 14:20:30
Yeah, the illuminati stuff is just so bizarre that got stuck in-between being a joke and being a legit point. 
I'll leave it there, though. Hope it doesn't distract much from the main point (you mention some of it).

Hahaha, funny. He nailed that piece, gotta give him credit.
