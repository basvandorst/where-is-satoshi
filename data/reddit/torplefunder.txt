Yeah the only issue is banks can shut you out citing "policy" and sure you can go after them legally or with an ombudsman but it's SUCH a hassle and takes a long time. It happened to me before and I ended up just settling for getting all my money out of my account that they had locked me out of. They're dicks really.

Haha. Should have. To be fair it is my own business. I'm pretty annoyed they felt they could even ask.

Thanks for those resources. Will read.

Yes. So this is my main fear really. Am I really a money mule if I am offering a service i.e. the sale of btc? Like isn't everyone selling btc on LocalBitcoins.com potentially a money mule then? What more do you think is necessary apart from ID verification and ensuring the funds come from that same person's account?

Thanks pal. This kind of worked. They responded saying they don't support payments to that beneficiary but they unlocked my account anyway.
Edit: Removed word for word response just in case and typo.

This particular customer is fine with paying first. Which great because I can move the money somewhere safe, obtain the btc and then just keep my profit but it also raises more questions about their legitimacy. I can protect myself from getting scammed I think but want to protect myself from being prosecuted basically. I would need to talk to a lawyer really.
