Regarding the recent allegations against Bitmex abusing their insights to trade against their customers to liquidate their positions, could anyone explain to me how rekt'ing customers would be beneficial for any exchange? I'm not seeing how there is money to be made. What am I missing?

You took OP's joke literally.

It's the transaction (sold 1 BTC), not the balance.

Do you get it now? Food turns to shit, which is a different form.

No idea.

I agree but what does *possessing* Bitcoin have to do with it? They are free to learn about it and become a blockchain developer if they want without owning any crypto.

Let me offer you a new perspective. Whether your investment is worth it mostly depends on how you value certain amount of money at a certain time/age. For example, I'd personally rather have 50€ at age 16 than 100€ at 18. I'm now 24 and if I could time travel to give my 16 year old self 50€ in exchange for losing 200€, I would do it. Don't miss out on your youth for just a couple of bucks that will be peanuts once you have a full-time job. Crypto is not going to explode so much to make you rich just from a 50€/month investment. Only throw money at it when you have nothing better to spend it on.

I hear this all the time but don't know what it means.

Good explanation, cheers!

That would be a waste of time. You are vastly overestimating your odds of being lucky. We're talking about numbers that are way, way beyond what would be considered astronomical.
