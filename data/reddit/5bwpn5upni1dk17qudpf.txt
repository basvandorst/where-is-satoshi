This ����. Sell that bitcoin to me.

Wow, you just scared me. That sounds really plausible, sneaky AF. Good read.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:56:31
Right? It makes my dick hard when governments and traditional financial institutions ban or try and scare people away from bitcoin.

You'll get used to and eventually quit hearing the noise. That, or you'll learn to love it.

It's weird having an appreciating currency—at least for now—incentivizes me to think before buying things but when I do I look back, "well, I kinda already made that money back." And yeah, I don't know how I feel about transaction fees since I mine and use the currency.

I wouldn't get anything that runs at less than 500 Gh/s and use server power supplies over ATX PC PSUs or the over priced PSUs that are offered from mining companies. I'm finding Bitmain ASICs and HP server PSUs to be a good price point. Message me if you need specifics.

I buy/sell the mining equipment, that I use, on ebay. *However*, research and shop around before you buy. Some people are paying ridiculous amounts for miners. If you have an extra $300 bucks laying around and want to learn about the network, start with that as the goal—even if you only break even you at least have a better currency than the USD.

How are you getting that? (Genuinely curious.)
Edit: Never mind. I thought the "0.4x" was a correction to the 10x increase through some accounting black magic.

I was just trying to submit this link. Did you see this part: 


Did that excite any of you? As soon as I read that I'm thinking, "gooood." We're starting to worry *the* fiat currency; starting to be seen as a worthy alternative.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:53:55
I say buy it and *use* it. (Hold some but start using it to buy things.)
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:11:21
I take that as a good sign that their shit currency isn't as good. You need to control the guns and the money to control the people.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:31:35
Yeah, I wish I had precognition like those people. I love how there's more and more negative articles on bitcoin coming from the financial sector as bitcoin gets more popular.
