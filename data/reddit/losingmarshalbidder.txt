Interesting!  Must be some kind of government thing.  I haven't seen it myself since I stopped doing it around 8th grade.

Unfortunately, I was kinda outta there since March 2010 (and now fully am). As soon as I heard about bitcoin in July 2010 I said we should take it, and people said I was crazy. Now they're all for it, but just haven't actually done it. Who knows!

@_date: 2014-06-30 21:25:41
Ha, you know what, that is probably why they did it like that. Those weirdos!
Although REALLY what they could have done is just say "place your bid price and max number of bitcoins you would like (minimum quantity is 3,000 BTC)".
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:58:56
Yeah, I guess I mostly just wanted to talk about the auction now that it's over. And I lost!
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:16:46
Ah, yeah back when I was thinking about doing my own "syndicate" I had figured I'd do it like that too. But then I saw they were only allowing one bid per deposit, lame.
But yeah, at least some of their bids likely came in a ways above mine, although nobody would have bid above market in the SM syndicate I would think, so yeah, it probably all went very close to market or even all above. But who knows for sure! All I know for sure is it was above $451.13.
Ha, unless the US Marshals just decided not to sell it at all, which they did retain the option to do.
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:01:02
&lt;plug&gt;Well... excuse the plug, but if you want, I do run chunkhost.com now... and it's bitcoin all the way!
5% off for paying in bitcoin, vps host starting at $5/mo for 512MB SSD drives, pre-pay for a year and the ram is doubled. So I believe right now it'd be .087 BTC for 12 months of 1GB VPS hosting!&lt;/plug&gt;

Hmm, that doesn't seem like exactly the same thing. I guess I feel like the luck component is in tandem to the risk-taking. As in, you only get lucky if you're in a position to get lucky, i.e. take a risk. But then that's the game you know you're playing and yeah, some people get lucky and some don't, but people who don't play at all don't ever win. So it's not really unfair if somebody ends up winning and somebody ends up losing when they both know the rules of the (mostly random) game and both choose to play.
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:14:34
Oh wait, what are the stakes?
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:42:28
I dunno, it's hard to say. On the one hand when I got into bitcoin I was of the mindset "I'm just going to hold this for 30 years until it's the main money of the world", but on the other hand if it gets to $5,000 that's pretty crazy. I still really don't want to ever sell it though. I'm sort of waiting for there to be a "margin" service where I can borrow against my btc at a low rate. That also helps with the tax issue... I especially don't want to sell and have to pay crazy taxes on the gains.
In general though, I've decided in investing you should never sell just because you feel the price is "too high". You should sell only when you feel like you have a better opportunity (including transaction costs, and tax liability) vs. leaving it where it is. Just holding USD though can be a better opportunity at times!
I sold 1/6th of my holdings at $125 back in March 2013 at the request of every single person I knew screaming "sell sell sell!". I immediately felt literally sick to my stomach though, and it didn't stop everybody from screaming "sell more! sell more! sell more!", so I haven't sold any since.
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:30:19
It's a throwaway account! :)
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:59:38
Word. There sure are a lot of "opportunities" out there to "invest" in!

You are welcome!
I am anonymous.
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:38:14
Ah yeah, I guess I mean I "feel" like it's $5 in the sense that if I spend or send some BTC I'm always a little shocked it's like .0514 BTC or whatever!
Overall I think I treat it pretty rationally though, when I consider whether to hold or sell it's usually just a quick analysis of "do I think the money will do better long term as bitcoin or as X (and X can be USD)?" So far it's always come down on the side of BTC. I did sell 1/6th of my holdings back in March 2013 at $120 when EVERYBODY I knew was screaming at me "sell sell sell", just to get them off my back. I immediately felt terrible though and it didn't get them off my back ("sell some more! sell some more!"), and I haven't sold any since.
I guess I don't have the same problem with wealth being a combination of work, savings, risk-taking, and luck! Maybe it's because I was already doing pretty well thanks to DreamHost and "regular" investments before 2012, and this just took it to a new level?
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:02:01
Started at ~$4, dollar cost averaged from March 2012 until March 2013.

I originally kept most in a brain wallet. Then, they became so valuable, I split it into a 2 of 3 paper wallet and opened two safety deposit boxes, one on the east coast, and one on the west coast, and keep one in each of them and the last one split again into a 2 of 3 and backed up completely different places online.
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:03:37
Because I still have my other coins!
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:00:23
Or never enough?
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:38:02
I'm not sure how that conclusion is drawn from that statement!
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:07:44
Throwaway account here.. I just got word I didn't win any either, I bid $451.13 for four blocks.
So they all went for more than $451.13.
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:37:29
I did lose a lot on mtgox because I was in the middle of doing arbitrage, plus all my bitcoin builder fees. I believe I'm still their biggest creditor/depositor. I actually did lose most of them on mtgox, but yes, I do still have a lot. But no, please do not feel sorry for me!
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:12:44
Subconsciously I probably do still feel kind of like 1 BTC =~ $5... but I'd say the only real mistake I made was not realizing the tax implications until after I'd made my bid. But, I think an argument could be made that I had "bought" the bitcoins as soon as my bid was made (or at least accepted), and so the coins I would have then sold could have been matched with the auction ones. Or, worst case I could have skipped my "pre-arb" strategy and just waited a few more days to actually get the coins before selling them. Heck, the way things have been going that probably would have resulted in a better return.
I don't think I really treat my "real work" money differently from my bitcoin gains, apart from the fact that &gt;95% of my bitcoin gains are still in bitcoin, locked away in cold storage and un-spendable/investable without a fair bit of effort. But the little I have sold was put in my bank account with the rest, so I wouldn't say was treated any differently.
I have a pretty risk-tolerant investing profile, but the way I generally make up for it is by trying to keep my spending way under my income, and any time I find a good risk-to-work swap, I'll do the work to minimize my risk!
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:19:45
I already have a bunch of bitcoin, so for me this was purely an arb play... I assume the winners were more in the "this is a good way to get into bitcoin" camp. 
If I had won I actually would have dumped my existing coins to cover as soon as I got word, across bitstamp and bitfinex. The fact that there was about 3 days between making the bid and knowing if you won and bitcoin is so volatile meant I wanted to bid low enough to be pretty sure that if I did win, I could immediately sell at a profit.
Maybe I'll make a new post on here actually about all my thought processesessees..

@_date: 2014-06-30 21:20:18
I thought it was low, but maybe a 10% chance of getting 1 lot, and since there was no cost to do it, what the hey. And practice for next time! And maybe I could parlay it into a sweet AMA. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:32:05
There were 9 3,000 BTC lots and 1 for 2,656.51306529. It was kind of silly.. they could have just made 10 lots of 2,965.651306529 each too. 
It's bitcoins, not ferraris!
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:39:12
Maybe that's why I didn't win!
But man, you actually had to print, physically sign, and scan the form, they (said, at least) they wouldn't accept it "digitally signed".

@_date: 2014-06-30 21:22:28
Let's see... if bitcoin is at $646.50...
about $5M short of where I want it to be!

Enough to start to realize why rich people don't usually publicize it!
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:26:52
That is a good point, but after losing the auction I'm feeling punchy...
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:14:28
Throwaway account here.. I just got word I didn't win any either, I bid $451.13 for four blocks.
So they all went for more than $451.13.
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:04:23
That is correct sir.. there was just a pdf you had to email to them with your bid sometime between 6am and 6pm EDT on Friday.
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:14:54
Ah yeah, the world is definitely unfair in terms of equal opportunities.
But if I'm just comparing all my friends who had similar economic means as me (even DreamHost co-founders) who I introduced and explained and recommended buying Bitcoin too starting back in 2011, none of whom ended up buying even any, vs. me spending a pretty significant portion of my net worth at the time on it, I think the results are "fair" even if lucky. 
I don't feel like my bitcoin gains were any less "earned" than money earned during my 14+ years at DreamHost.
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:57:00
Yeah, the other idea I had, but was just too scared, was to bid on ALL the lots, closer to the market price, and treat the whole thing as a four day option at a cost of ~1%. Because bidding on all would be about $18M (not that I could have afforded it, but got a few people together to do it)... at only a $200K cost to abandon your bid if the price went down during those four days. And then hope the price went up in the meantime. Which it has!
But that's not really arbitrage any more. But still a pretty good risk-hedging strategy.
Essentially the same strategy as this guy did to take atlantic city for $6M playing blackjack:

@_date: 2014-06-30 21:43:08

It was at 12:13pm, about 1:26 ago..... now!
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:13:55
Yeah exactly.. maybe not more than a dozen or two people would get it together in time to register... and then actually bid. Oh well, I can't complain at $644 a coin either!
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:01:25
Not really, but maybe there was a 5% chance I'd get some?
I also thought of it as good "practice" for the "REAL" auctions down the line; the rest of the silk road coins and the likely mtgox liquidation.
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:53:11

@_date: 2014-06-30 21:18:36
Yeah, I thought it was too. If you take a 50/50 bet but have a deal where you only lose half if you lose, it becomes a pretty great expected return!

It was fun and I don't have any wire fees on my account (up to a certain number a month, based on high balance)..
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:57:22
No problem!
I think I will, although that time I'd probably see if I could get a bit of a syndicate going. The problem with a syndicate (as second market found out) with an auction like this where you can only make one bid, is that you have to bid an average of all your syndicated bids. Which means you probably aren't going to have the highest bid (unless you're most of the volume).
In terms of tactics, I'd assume I'd end up bidding a little higher, but again I'd probably be in it for the potential arb, so I'd still go below market. How much below depends on the depth and number of coins and current price and the rest of my finances (and/or the syndicate size) though. I'd probably not end up winning again, but I'd still participate!
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:18:40
I actually realized that could be an issue AFTER I placed my bid... in fact, depending on how the market "seemed" to be acting, I may have just ended up waiting until I actually received the coins to make the sale, just so I could say it was actually the new coins being sold and not my old stash. Or maybe the same day at least and fudged it a tiny bit? It was all moot anyway in the end!
Yeah... a LOT of tax here in California.
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:36:47
How do you arbitrage the other direction? I guess my definition of arbitrage is when there's (essentially) no risk.
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:12:34
Nope! Just like orange. 
It's what originally drew me to bitcoin really.
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:03:45
I guess not?!
@_date: 2014-06-30 22:32:19
Oh yeah, it's up in the original post! $100 under the current depth when I bid to dump the coins, to give room for volatility during the 3 days until I found out and still make a profit. And then to make it a little weird in case somebody else was in the same ballpark.
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:56:42
THERE ARE NO ACCIDENST!
