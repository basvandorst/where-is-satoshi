Your point about the consensus algorithm is a good one. One thing David Mazières is currently spearheading is development of a provably-correct version of consensus. I think it's very important that whatever primitives you're building on have solid theoretical foundations, and I'm pretty excited to see the infrastructure improvements Stellar is going to introduce there.

I actually agree with a lot of those points. Additionally, I think one very important lesson the community has learned is that the initial conditions of your system will have a huge amount of impact on where it ultimately goes. The hope with Stellar is to set things up in a fair and transparent way. That on its own certainly isn't enough, but the belief is that it's a necessary condition to make an impact with a new payment system.

This post is a vision of the future. It's not a statement about what Stripe will or won't become. The real point we're making is that if you aren't excited about a world with centralized trust providers, then you should probably start working on distributed reputation.
The great thing about open cryptocurrency networks is that they allow anyone to come in and start building. That's incredibly exciting, and it'll be the first time we had a financial system with that property.
In terms of our credit card policies: as I mention in other comments on this thread, we're restricted in terms of what we're allowed to do by our banking partners and the realities of how credit cards work. It's in our interests too to have more businesses using Stripe — those traditionally thought of as high risk are among the more interesting businesses — and so we push back where we can. But that change doesn't happen overnight or in every case, so we abide by our partners' rules where we have to.
If you feel we misunderstood your business, feel free to email me at gdb and I can connect you to the right people internally. (As elsewhere, I can't guarantee we can change anything, but we definitely want to do everything we can to help.)

I wish it were that simple :). pay_per_wallet has the right idea — we ultimately *do* advocate on our users' behalf, and it pains us when we aren't able to do so successfully.
VenomSpike, if you still feel we don't fully understand your business, we'd be happy to spend some more time digging into it with you. Email me: gdb and I can connect you to the right people internally. It may not end up changing anything (once again we are restricted in our actions), but we certainly want to make sure we've done everything we can for you.

The founders' stellar comes out of the 5% reserved for operational costs. See the following for details:
  
Note that all stellar grants vest over a 4-year period.

We were trying to be pretty open/explicit about that, actually. From the blog post: "The technology is based on the open-source Ripple project, originally created by Jed a few years ago".

Sorry you had trouble with us. We are legitimately restricted in the businesses we can support for credit card processing. We try to be as open and accessible as possible, and we continually work with our banking partners and the card networks to push forward the set of businesses we can support.
This is true not just for new technologies and business models but also for issues like free speech ( and DMCA takedowns (
We're not perfect, and we do have fundamental restrictions on what we can do. We want to know of any cases where we've fallen short, and while I can't promise we can change anything tomorrow, I can promise that we'll be constantly working to help support the next wave of awesome things being built on the web.

As I mention below, I think the most important aspect of Stellar is the approach they're taking, both to transparency and the initial distribution of the currency. I don't know of another payment network that has taken this approach before. In my mind, the technology isn't the novel part here (as you say, Ripple has been around for a long time), but the social approach is a refreshing thing to see in the space.

As I mention above, we are legitimately limited in the kinds of businesses we can help with credit card processing. It's not about our company's position — I think this post outlines pretty deeply our excitement for what comes next — but it's simply about the rules of the existing systems. While we can and will try to find ways to help, there are limits to what's possible.
As I mentioned in my reply to you on Twitter, we're be happy to chat live with you to make sure we understand your business fully and correctly, and see if there's any way we can make it work.
Again, we're not perfect, and we're operating within fundamental constraints. But Stripe is about helping enable the next wave of online payments, and we correspondingly are doing our best to help out in this space.

I think the comment you're referring to was slightly mistaken: see my response ( Anyone is able to start their own gateway; the advantage of gateways just means not everyone *has* to figure out how to issue their own credit.

The short answer: we're working with the existing financial players to try to make the acceptance experience as seamless for our merchants as possible. We're making sure to be deliberate and cover our bases, which ends up taking a lot of time.

Here's the root commit:  That being said, there's no question that Stellar owes a lot to Ripple, and Ripple community.

Gotcha. I think that'll ultimately be up to Coinbase (Stellar wouldn't be able to do it without their help). You should probably let Coinbase know you're interested, so they can get a sense of customer demand.

Main differences:
- Stellar is based on a consensus algorithm rather than mining ( This means transactions confirm in a few seconds.
- The supply of stellar increases at a fixed rate of 1% a year (
- Stellar aims to let you transact in your currency of choice (fiat or digital).
The hope is that the stellar currency itself will be mostly a behind-the-scenes currency, and that the Stellar network will help provide more liquidity between currencies.

I think it'll still be on the timescale of months. It turns out that we're breaking a surprising amount of new ground with our integration.
However, we'll be increasing our rate of bringing aboard new beta merchants in the meanwhile. You should also let Squarespace know you're interested — I'm sure they'd love to know what user interest looks like.

We as a community certainly learned (and continue to learn) a lot from Ripple. Stellar has chosen a different approach: the entity developing the system is a nonprofit, the vast majority of the coins are being given away (which you can watch here:  and the code is all open-source from day one. Their focus on transparency and getting coins into as many people's hands as possible was what made us excited about funding them.
At the end of the day, I think this a huge space, with room for lots of players. We're trying to do our part to help move it forward — even if Stellar doesn't end up being the top system in the long term, we hope that it'll help bolster the existing ecosystems along the way.

Not actually centralized! As I mentioned in a previous comment,  is a good reference for understanding the model.
