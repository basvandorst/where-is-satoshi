not disagreeing. OP's question was literally, has burglaries in greece gone up. I answered with source.

In a word yes. Home burglaries are up 76% from 5 years ago, safe sales have tripled.

Hello Eden, I had not heard of you util i stumbled onto your blog. 
A question, why is there no news on ZEDE? i saw a single article in panampost.com ( but i had a hard time following their lines of thought. 
I understand that you are trying to keep it out of the news, but one would think that a new economic zone that endorses crypto-currencies would be a huge news story as bitcoin is getting explosively popular right now. 
Two questions, could you let us know who some of the people on this executive council are? if not, some of their general qualifications?
lastly, I think this is a great idea, but the prospect of moving to Honduras is frightening as i think of it as not as safe as america, what kind of security and law enforcement are you planning to help allay my fears( and even harder, help convince my wife ;) )
Thanks for all the work,m and i will eagerly follow your advances.

I was not impressed. I like Ron Paul, but if I was going to do a segment on bitcoin, I'd at least read some more info on it, and have a better stance than it sounds good, but I don't know enough to say it is good.

I agree, he has made a name for himself by being consistent and who he is. He should not change that strategy.

as i understand it, and i could be completely wrong - land would not be owned, but leased by the zone, and this lease would be the base of the taxes, so a house with a huge yard might have a lower selling value than a small apartment due to the "lease" due on the land. Am I right? or completely misunderstanding this? thanks
