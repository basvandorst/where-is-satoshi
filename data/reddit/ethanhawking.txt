Depends. The investments are through financial institutions not associated with Bitcoin. You'd be putting your money into a fund that wouldn't be directly associated with your financial investment in Bitcoin.
What you are talking about would be hedging the Bitcoin market. Pretty much like covering a bet in gambling with a seperate bet, in the hopes that if one looses, the other may win and cover your loss. In the best case, you will most likely break even.

They have been correct so far...
Do interpret this as truth...or wishful thinking?

No, link a bank or Debit card and it will take straight from that. That is how I have done my last few buys from them. Fees aren't grossly excessive either.

So many more buyer's should that happen. Good for the whole ecosystem.

Cash out to PayPal. Make your bank deposits in amounts less then $10,000 in a 24 hour window. More then $10,000, and you'll have to fill out a W-9 taxpayer identification form. If your bank deposits at about $3,000-$4,000 a week, you should be safe.
Also, with the money locked in PayPal, you can buy shit online or get a PayPal prepaid Mastercard and use that card for tangible purchases.

How about some grammar and learning to type. We're trying to not look like a bunch of assholes.

With an investment, you can bet that the value will go down. 
A "short" is a way of investing in a lower value to try to gain off of a loss.
For example: A "Guy" LOANS you a lamp worth $100.  You sell it to someone for $100, but you know that the value of that lamp will decrease to $60 next month. In a month, they don't want it anymore because the value has decreased. So, you buy that lamp back for $60, then return it to "Guy" that you initially BORROWED it from.
You have now made $40.
