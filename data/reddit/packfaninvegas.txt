Agreed, no doubt a bit conservative. My gut just tells me the hysteria kicks in the first quarter of next year. Wouldn’t surprise me at all to see 20K by January. But if it stays lower, more time to accumulate ����‍♂️
We’ll end up anywhere from 30K-50K end of next year.

Lol nah
@_date: 2019-07-21 00:49:45
We’re dropping back to 2K. /s
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:47:17
Maybe even 3 years
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:23:37
lol I bought some at $12.9K doing this
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:50:04
Slow growth to 13k-15K end of year. 20K+ by summer of next year

Ah shit here we go again
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:10:51

@_date: 2019-06-22 02:47:25
what are you on about
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:31:56
I'm in the same boat. I've been DCAing since December and am transferring from ETrade to put into more bitcoin (hopefully should hit bank account tomorrow). I'm kind of worried about it, but at the same time, I think we're just getting started on these runs.
I think im just going to do it. Super risky, but the reward is tremendous.
EDIT: if anything, maybe put like 25-30% of it in immediately and DCA the rest over time
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:08:28
yeah same. I'm waiting till at least 25K to buy, i'd hate to buy early
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:18:50
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:15:49
