You're right, there will always be demand for certain goods in less time rather than more, but what about for larger ones? The items you pointed out are essentials, or really moderately small items.
The big problem with deflation is there's no incentive for the wealthy to spend their money, and thus, prevent it from pooling to the top, so to speak.
A savings account and an investment account are two very different animals...

This article is pretty willfully ignorant. Credit cards have consumer protection built into them, things like zero liability for unauthorized use, and chargebacks. They also, well, have... credit. Bitcoins have no built-in concept of borrowing money. And if I swipe my credit card at a point of sale, the transaction is over in under a minute, including the time it takes for me to sign. For bit coins? I have to wait. This is really all comparing apples and oranges.
I'm not a naysayer, I'm just realistic here. Bitcoin is not ready to compete with Visa.

There will always be SOMEONE who is wealthy. It doesn't matter how they got there. Some people will eventually make it to the top. This is just natural. My question is, how do we ensure that the top and the bottom (and middle), grow together? At least in an inflationary economy, the top MUST invest their money (which funds the lower classes), or they lose it over time.

Never attribute to malice that which can be attributed to stupidity.

The wealthy do not sit on their money, they invest it, which allows the lower classes to borrow money cheaply and say, start a business. If the rich has no incentive to invest, cheap borrowing for the lower classes disappear, which prevents them from taking risks like opening a business, buying a car, etc. all these things elevate your status

There are some promising technologies out there, they're just not ready for widespread adoption yet. :)

I mean, I've written off my small GoxCoin balance as a total loss. The fact that there is any coin at all is reason to be cautiously optimistic.

I guess I should've restricted my argument a bit. Obviously people will always want essentials, and certainly make purchases such as computers, or other items in demand.
I'm really concerned about the big wealthy players though. What prevents wealth from pooling to the top when there's no incentive to invest funds you have just "sitting"?

This doesn't really prove anything, though. Any kind of public release would be drafted up earlier than the time it was released. It's not like PR is done the moment it's needed and then immediately disseminated. A single day seems very reasonable to prepare a statement and release. Alone, it's not really proof of anything.

That's exactly the conclusion I've come to personally, though I was hoping someone would really offer some substantial debunking of what I brought up.

You're right, but the interest rate on a savings account is small, whereas investment accounts will vary and require you to hold your money there. You don't put millions of dollars into a savings account unless you enjoy losing money to inflation.

I disagree with the premise that inflation causes pooling by itself. Certainly we're experiencing the problems that happen when wealth pools to the top, but I disagree with the idea that inflation is why.
As inflation increases, my money becomes worth less, and I have to invest and return a higher percentage of profit to keep up. So it quickly becomes clear that if you have high inflation, the wealthy are hurt along with the poor, at least. It makes everyone's lives more difficult. Deflation not so much.

Crypto will survive regardless of whether or not Gox coins are recovered or not. Hell, I have a few, and I've written them off as a loss.
Having said that, loading the 200K coins into a binary tree like what we're seeing isn't consistent with taking them and running, it's consistent with loading them into the hot wallet to resume at least some kind of functionality. I'd say this is a good sign, but remain cautiously optimistic.

Gox doesn't need to let people submit claims for coins, they have all the internal accounting for who has what balance of coins. Those are all the claims. Since the data for these TXs are showing up in the MtGox API, we can at least favor the possibility that this is somehow related to official MtGox business. If the money was being laundered, we'd expect it to not be on the API, and frankly, that'd be a pretty stupid idea since everyone would know who to blame.

That's all fine and dandy but it doesn't answer the important question of what keeps money moving from the top down?
If person A has 1 BTC and person B has 200, any deflation benefits both owners but person B even moreso. Why would person B invest his money when he can sit on it and make money for doing nothing?
