Key points:  
- stops selling hw  
- mines in own computing centers BTC/LTC  
- wants to increase hashing power from 3% to 20% total  
- atm it costs ~~clearly~~- significantly below 400 USD to mine 1 BTC  
- some trouble lately

Don't think Bitcoin, think cryptocurrencies. There are many areas where you need transparency, like: charities, politics, probably automated payments along a supply chain.
  
For a full stand-alone cash replacement bitcoin is not appropriate, but other cryptos are underway afaik (e.g. zerocoin).

Actually, it is written in the FAQ. You cannot lose more than  
the deposit for a given position.  
btc.sx has the right to liquidate a position, once it reaches  
a distance less than 20% of the stop. By doing so, they are  
in a position to always win something.  
Another route of revenue are the daily funding costs of a  
position, starting on the 2nd day.

Keep in mind that bitcoincharts.com is run by Tibanne corporation, the company owning Mt.Gox.

I think we are at cross-purposes here.  
Person A has the funds to buy 1 BTC now.  
Person B has the funds to buy 100 BTC now.  
Now taking your original statement:  


I disagree. Assume that A is the ideal of a human, superior  
than B in the criteria you described.  Assumed linear  
growth of BTC price, the ratio between accumulated wealth  
remains constant. It gets worse for A with exponential growth.  
If you equate wealth with being-in-a-position-of-power, it follows that B -  
even if not as qualified as A - maintains or improves her position.


I did neither state, nor implied this.

@_date: 2013-10-28 15:13:34
+1 is right. When you send someone  
BTC a transaction is constructed. In this transaction the funds  
for the receipient, your change (if you do not send all funds  
from the sending address) and the amount of fees for miners  
are represented.  
  
This gets then signed with your signing key (private key).  
Signing and broadcasting are different steps.  
  
Broadcasting is telling all the peers in the peer-to-peer network  
that transaction with Transaction-ID is out to be confirmed.  
  
Mt.Gox has not broadcast your transaction, otherwise you would  
see something on blockchain.info.  
Good luck.

Even thought, I have never even thought of 'thievery' or 'unjust means', I don't even understand how you could read this into my statements, I can  agree now with core of your statement.  
However, keep in mind that all of A, B and C are in a privileged position  
with regards to having access to technology in the first place.  
Thank you very much for this interaction and your time. I really  
enjoyed it (no joke).

Nice to read! If it gets tougher, Tibanne could  sell Gox. After all, there is still volume and revenue, as  well as trust in the technical platform (pretty much none in the PR).

guys... you are missing the *"___and why???"*

How can I be sure that bitaddress.org and vanitygen  
don't have implementation errors leading to private keys  
that are generated with low entropy?

*confirmed* is the status, when you request the withdrawal.  
*pending* is the status, when Gox finally issued the real  
transfer. Your request gets cancelled within 2h .. 2d afaik.

What about reddit's IP logs for this user?  
As he gloriously turned the verbal agreement with his dad into a written confession, it can now be enforced by law.

The philosophical question:  
How can you say it hasn't happen already?

How strongly will tomorrows live atms will affect the bitcoin  price?  Do you think it will ignite mass adoption?

You are one of the unlucky, most BTC withdrawals seem to  
work. Bad news spread faster than good ones and stick.  
Think of a reddit: "I got my btc-withdrawal".
Keep me posted on the latest development in your case.

Nobody stated nor implied this. It is the aggregation of   
knowledge-providing facilities about a thing with providing-   
facilities for the same thing, which in every domain should   
be questioned.
But your logic, even on false premises is flawed. MgGox  
went down way later (no offence).

 Have you posted your issue in their official  
forum? If yes, please provide the link here. If it got deleted  
repost and provide the link here. Additionally please start a  
thread on bitcointalk and make sure you have some proof.  
Your service for the bitcoin community is highly appreciated.

I was familiar with the name, but have not come around  
to fully dive into the project.

Not every staff can access everything.  
Could make sense...

hmm, in combination with the wall...

I don't see a way for you to mess this up, sorry.

Years back, there was some worm that cleant up/optimized systems. Something like that asking for a kind donation or pointing towards XBT would be cool.

+thank you for your answer.  
You are right. People should only commit a small fraction as  
long as it is easy/easier to do so.  
Committing could be done incredible lightweight, like in a  
reddit comment: Committing to idea &lt;whatever_the_name&gt; &lt;amount-btc&gt;.  
It would be crucial though that the person ensures that the  
funds reach the target - something charities sometimes  
seem to have a problem with.  
I have not worked out, how this would function, but the  
protocol should allow for it and we have to start somewhere.

You could always go on the bitcointalk.org forum and look  
for OTC traders. Being in their web-of-trust could be fun, too.

- someone on bitcointalk.org translated the original article linked to from above source  
- you could use google translate on the original link
TL;DR: Early release of future btc support to the public as a PR instrument.  
They do not have the infrastructure built yet to support mass payments, but rather  
started out lightweight by providing the public with a btc-address:

Thank you. Somehow overlooked the other two links in the op.

Bitcoincharts.com is much more than a plain datafeed.
A lot of man-hours went into the technical analysis tools. 
Unfortunately, I do not know of any other sites providing this amount of tools. Imho an independent (open-source) project a-better-than-bitcoincharts.com is needed for Bitcoin;
reason being the point I mentioned above.

Happened to me once, too. I got an email on request, iirc  
the bottom line was that I should remain calm for up to 48 hrs.  You got such an email giving instructions?
