You are a great human being, there needs to be more people like you in the world. I wish you all the happiness in the rest of your life.

A lot of people got sucked into the hype, it's quite sad really. I mean in a few years people will be happy they bought in at 20k but buying in straight after a huge increase in value is always a risky move.

Just a little update, I've received an email from the police asking to provide evidence and I have. I'm now waiting on any response, I'm pretty sure that anyone that lost out won't get anything back but it is nice to hope!

It will be refused 100%, this will keep happening for as long as the SEC can refuse them.
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:11:15
But experts know the future! Seriously though, majority of these price articles are just by those with agendas.

"However, he has scored a 50 to 80 percent chance that Bitcoin ends up being worthless. Also a 20 to 50 percent chance that it’s values goes even higher."
Seems like he is really sure he knows where the price is going.. /s

How did they shill you into BCH? In the upcoming years there are going to be many sour BCH investors..

At this point I'm not sure who still supports either fork, it truly is hilarious.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:51:01
So if it jumped 10&amp; up after you bought it would be the best currency ever?
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:26:41
5 years. The only way to win is to play long term, unless you have money money than whales.
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:04:56
Yeah Escrow, what the other guy said. If you pick a verified trader with at least 10 other trades and trusted by other members on LBC you'll be fine. Just ALWAYS do bank transfer. Never do Paypal.
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:53:59
These type of people are gullible idiots, it's sad they were taken advantage of really.
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:31:47
This is accurate.
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:58:31
All these posts make me laugh, the only people panicking are those who haven't even been in the market a year.
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:09:31
I've just heard people having trouble with PayPal. You don't need to give out your card details, if you are buying you just send money to an account provided for you using your online banking app.
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:36:09
I'm in the UK and I just use LocalBitcoins, I've used it for 4 years and never had any problems. Just buy and sell from reputable traders that have been on the site more than 1 year.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:41:25
Definitely, it is coming down quite quickly. Good thing I am watching lots of alts take massive drops, now I'm just waiting to buy.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:38:39
This isn't ugly, I think people have to remember that anyone who has been in crypto more than one year still sees this as fairly high, so there are still people that can take profit.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:14:32
I agree with everything you just said.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:49:20
I've used them for 3 years with zero trouble but about 2 years ago most traders wouldn't trade with anyone without sending proof of ID. I buy and sell via bank transfer so not really anonymous either.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:50:43
I'd say in the next 10 years.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:27:09
In a few years you'll be happy.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:36:49
I remember not too long ago when Bitcoin reaching $1000 was never going to happen. It's either going to zero or going to more than it's previous ATH.
I love this sub and the many prophets around, if I followed the advice here I'd probably be losing a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:54:49
What a mess, I wonder when the forks for Bitcoin Cash ABC and SV will happen..
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:15:11
Well that's pretty depressing you do that with your free time, all the best to you I hope life picks up in the near future.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:45:29
Pretty spot on, but people are emotional and don't seem to expect the unexpected. Most people I've seen talking on Reddit the last few months have been talking about an xmas bull run, so more and more people expect that. They could still be right but it's better for people to think for themselves rather than follow what everyone else is saying.
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:07:56
Then I can see why you are so bitter, take a holiday and come back in 4 years. It'll be much higher than this or it will be a zero. There you go, I'm your Bitcoin Reddit prophet.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:32:00
Free fall, cute.
Worste.. God
This sub sure went downhill after last years bull run.
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:05:50
Pretty certain. I would expect crypto to be worth trillions before the bubble "bursts".
I see one more huge bull run for Bitcoin and crypto in general coming within the next few years, probably with regulation which will bring in many new investors as the crypto-space will be much safer.
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:38:59
In 2014 I swear they were banning it every other week..
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:28:03
If you are playing long term, I think this is still very low :) But it is always good to increase the cryptofolio short term! 
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:11:15
I'd rather risk and make more, that is my trading style :)
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:27:07
I meant that I would rather just wait for the downtrend/panic to finish and to see the market start heading up again before I buy back in
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:27:34
Hahah thank you! Good luck :)
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:21:50
I am waiting to re-enter but I'd rather buy on the way back up than on the way down.. No idea where the bottom is going to be
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:18:25
"Entire world" Lmfao, I love you noobs on this sub, how long have you been here?
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:03:45
XEL, QRL &amp; ARK

Buy BTC &gt; Flip alts &gt; make more BTC &gt; Put 50% BTC profits into wallet. It has worked for me for the past few years.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:50:54
IMO $3500 won't be the bottom..

Hello! First thank you for the reply, I was hoping somebody would. I don't know if you use Bitcointalk but the Moolah/MintPal Scam thread from Oct 2014 is quite helpful, had a few people also say that it was legit so I completed the survey. I really didn't think I would hear much more about it but it is nice to know the case is ongoing. 
I hope we can recover our funds, even though I think it is very still unlikely!
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:19:12
The saying goes, the best time to buy BTC was 2010, the second best time is now.
You could buy and it might drop short term, but I think long term it is going to at least $50k IMO.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:40:11
I'd say this is a bear trap before heading up to $6500 over the next few days, then BTC will float around $5-6k for a few months while alts recover. Nothing goes up forever, and people here seem to forget that..
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:06:14
Well if you hold 1 BTC you will also have 1 BTC Gold.
The value will probably not be the same but the quantity of crypto will be.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:07:17
Correct :)
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:35:26
Damn that sucks man, well you can always day trade to try for some more if you are ballsy.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:27:07

@_date: 2017-09-14 14:48:04
I think in a few years time you may feel the same as me, but I am not certain. I think you could trade alts to make more BTC for the future, but that is just what I would do, holding is a good option if you don't need the money anytime soon :)
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:49:56
I sold a few days back, but I am buying in a little each $100 dip
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:42:40
Even if it does alts will head back into an uptrend (IMO). Similar thing happened in August.
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:03:58
Yeah me neither, with the rise of BTC and most alts listed on MP they would probably have to reimburse so many millions in fiat considering how low BTC was back then and that just wouldn't happen. I only lost 1.5 BTC and 200 DASH, at the time it wasn't much but now it is a lot and a few years from now I am sure it will be a lot more.
Anyway BCT thread:
It's good for signature campaigns for free BTC ;) Hahah.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:07:04
Yes that is completely true, I should have mentioned short term that is my bad. I would expect to see BTC head to at least $50-100K in the next decade.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:56:21
I bought some at $1100 in January 2014, there are many options you have now. I am very glad I bought in at that price a few years ago even though it dropped to $250 half a year after..
@_date: 2018-07-02 08:16:30
Even if it goes back to $2k it can still become a trillion dollar market in the next few years, it doesn't really make a difference.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:06:42
Bitcoin has surprised me enough over the last 4 years. I am done trying to predict a price on a yearly basis, I just know eventually we will hit $1T :D
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:33:55
I think this explains the current uproar and I agree with that post, it's an outright lie.
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:38:33
So if more and more people are trying to buy a finite amount of something, the price won't rise? 
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:48:42
Bitcoin adoption hasn't peaked, current prices are due to people selling which then usually trying to re-enter lower. It's still a traded asset and people can make money from it, it's not going to go straight up relative to adoption.
