but 10 dollars dude ? I mean come on. That’s the price of eating one meal in the US, 2 drinks from Starbucks. if you’re at a point where investing 10 dollars is a big burden you have no business investing in a volatile asset like bitcoin. The return isn’t worth it even with exponential growth. I’ve been broke as a mothafucka, I know

Do not follow this advice. Might as well ask a chimp at the zoo for this same advice

Right now it’s an immature market and  volatility will persist until it stabilizes further in the future . This is why right now it’s an investment and less of a store of value. By design bitcoin will increase in value over time. I highly recommend reading the bitcoin standard by ammous. Just stfu until you read it. Nobody on here is gonna convince you and I personally don’t care to. It’s your loss if you sit on the sideline

“I had a good signal”  that’s what every day trader says, and they are usually full of shit 
“I was unable to sell” why? If the signal is so good, then why didn’t you sell? 
what is the point of your post? What is the point of saying any of this? Stfu and hold then

10 dollars a month? do you collect change under couch cushions for a living?
@_date: 2019-07-26 14:49:52
I dunno what your point is lol. My entire family background is from impoverished countries, I don’t need a geography lesson from you. I’m just saying 10 dollars a month is an abysmally low amount for the primary demographic of this site

I am relaxed and we are having a normal conversation. My point is that you will always be tempted to sell based on predictions that may or may not be right. But if you buy dips and hold, long term you will succeed. If you’re making big time trades and you’re experienced trader, maybe you can make some good money trading, but it’s risky. Just slowly buy and hold. These are exciting times for bitcoin. We’re all early

It seems like nobody here understands wtf you’re trying to say
