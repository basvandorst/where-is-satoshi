It's similar to the differences between running an eBay store vs a woocommerce store. EBay has millions of shoppers browsing, searching, buying everyday. Ebay is a marketplace. A shopping mall is also a marketplace. When you start a woocommerce store you have zero shoppers until you promote it. It's like a store on the outskirts of town. Nobody will visit unless you spend time and money on advertising.  
Openbazaar is a fledgling marketplace, if it becomes a destination that people shop for products it will reduce the costs and barriers to entry for sellers to connect with buyers.

Most of the hate for Coinbase on this subreddit is pure politics.  Coinbase supports big blocks, this subreddit supports small blocks. Therefore anytime a post comes up about Coinbase there are plenty of shills in the ready to shit all over them. The same thing happens on that other bitcoin subreddit if you bring up Segwit or Lightning Network. Plenty of shills over there ready to plant FUD in the minds of anyone who asks about them. Are there legitimate concerns about Coinbase's KYC / AML enforcement? Sure, if you require anonymous transactions. If you're just a HODLer who buys the occasional cup of coffee with Bitcoin. Leaving a few coins with Coinbase is fine.

Let me break it down for you on simpler terms. Your website is a store. A marketplace is a mall. On the internet if you have a store, you must know how to get people to that store to buy stuff. If not, your store might as well be out in the country, down a dirt road with no sign out front. Nobody will visit your store. But what if your store was some where that people already are? What if thousands of people walked by your store everyday? All you needed to do was put a sign up to get customers. That is like a mall. People go to malls to find products. Google is not a mall. Google is the yellow pages for the internet when it comes to finding suppliers.

Do I really need to explain to you the differences between a website and a marketplace? eBay is a marketplace, they charge 15%. OB is a marketplace, it charges 0%. Your website is, well, a website.

But people go to eBay and buy things from vendors they never heard of  because eBay is a marketplace. It's called discovery. It's one of about 10 differences between a website and a marketplace.

Coinbase is building a bridge to the bitcoin settlement. A settlement that will not grow without more bridges. Coinbase is not the only bridge, but it is a big expensive beautiful one. The investors that took the risk deserve to have a shot at getting their money back plus more. To say Coinbase has nothing to do with bitcoin is disingenuous. Coinbase has to continue to monetize their user base and play by all the rules to survive the uncharted territories of USA based bitcoin banking. So yeah they are going to become the PayPal of bitcoin. Which is fine. I'd much rather have a "PayPal with rails to bitcoin" than the PayPal we have today. They are not the only bridge to bitcoin but they are doing a pretty good job of trying to be a profitable one.

No. There are two types of buyouts when it comes to acquiring companies, asset or equity deals. An asset deal means someone comes in and buys the building, equipment, customer database, brand, website, etc. Or any combination of any assets the company has. They leave the stock with the original owners.   
In an equity deal the buyer pays for everything, assets and stock (equity). Under this type of deal the new owner is responsible for the debts of the company.

In 1995 most people did not even have a home computer or even heard of the internet. The average person would to initially invest a good deal of time getting set up just to complete their first transaction. And there were few merchants to buy from.   
This is where we are with bitcoin. Most people have a computer and internet connection but have never heard of bitcoin.  Getting set up to make their first purchase is going to take some time and there are few merchants to deal with.

What you're not taking into consideration is that as more merchants come on board, less will cash out to dollars. You see, I'm an online merchant that accepts bitcoins. I've done tens of thousands of dollars in bitcoins. Not a lot to Newegg, but a lot to me. Previously I have done exactly what you said, cashed out most of my bitcoins besides ordering a few pizzas. Now however, I need some new computers for the office. Guess where I will be ordering those from? Why? Because I have to pay a fee to convert those bitcoins into dollars. I know newegg, I've bought from them for years. I trust that they wont screw me over, so I don't really need the chargeback protection and thus don't want to pay for it through a credit card company. As more merchants adopt bitcoin, newegg may start holding back a percentage of what they collect, similar to overstock.

Netflix offering me a 1% discount does not shift all of their monetary benefit to me. CC fees typically are in the 2% range add in the labor required to deal with CC disputes, fraud, managing relationships with CC processors and it gets more expensive. Point is the merchant doesn't have to give me all of the benefit, only part of it and we both save money.

I don't see it this way. The more liquidity bitcoin has, the more people will see value in using/accepting it.   


This means more merchants must start accepting bitcoins so the merchants that want to pay for goods in bitcoin can spend them.  If in the beginning 90% of merchants cash out immediately it doesnt matter as long as the volume of merchants increases. Over time as more merchants accept it, more merchants will be able to use it.   
It would be stupid for a business to say at this point "we're going to keep the thousands of dollars of cash flow tied up in bitcoins until we can find a place to spend them on products we need."

I said the current mining system is destroying bitcoin because it is so operationally inefficient miners must sell most of their mined coins to cover overhead. If designed differently to be easier, more widely distributed, and less potentially profitable, average users could use it to contribute and acquire small amounts of bitcoin. Most people would see it as free money. No it really would not be due to electricity but most people would not really factor that in.  
Then what would you have? Potentially millions of people who have small amounts of bitcoin and because it was "free" they really don't care about negative price swings.  
As I mentioned in another comment, the mining ship has sailed. There is no changing that. But bitcoin needs a killer app, something that drives millions of users to acquire bitcoin and use it as internet cash. Millions of users are not going to invest thousands of dollars into bitcoin, they don't have the cash or the stomach for the price swings.  
However, if they could easily acquire $20-30 dollars worth in exchange for something they don't really see as a cost to them (storage, bandwidth, CPU cycles) then millions of people would sign up.  
This is where mining failed and because of it is driving the price down and missed the opportunity to drive mass user adoption.

With fiat, the government has full control of the flow valve and can change the water pressure as they see fit.
There is a huge difference between the two.

Would this be financially beneficial for the exchanges as well? If there was a feature that prevented me from spending more than 1 bitcoin in a month even though I have 10 in my account, or just made it much more difficult through enhanced security, its kind of like a CD. The wallet or exchange would be more confident the coins are going to be held longer in their service and the user is more comfortable the account is not going to get drained if some one compromises it.

Online merchants save a few percent on CC fees and no charge backs. Bricks and mortar stores save even less.  
"Hey mom, go get anal probed at a bitcoin ATM so you can save 1% at Macy's. Just hope that the price doesn't swing 3% between the time you leave the ATM and get to Macy's."

I'm assuming that in 20 years bitcoin liquidity will be pervasive enough that 10 to 15% of people will see it as just another store of value. They'll keep some because its convenient to use in several types of transactions for them. Converting to fiat will cost them a few percent, but the coffee shop down the street takes it so why not hold on to it.

Password strength is determined by entropy. Entropy can be increased by character length or symbol set.   
Case insensitive alphanumeric (36 symbols) introduces 5.170 bits of entropy per symbol.   
Case sensitive alphanumeric (62 symbols) introduces 5.954 bits of entropy per symbol.  
Yes, password length introduces more entropy than using mixed case, (entropy doubles with each character), but using both creates the most entropy.

Not trolling. Just having fun busting Frogo on a technicality. He's a well known FUD'er any time someone mentions Coinbase. I actually mostly agree with his premise, he just doesn't know how to articulate it correctly.    
 * 1) Never store your bitcoins on an exchange. Agreed  
 * 2) Never store more bitcoins than you are willing to lose in an online wallet where you don't control the private keys. Agreed.
The issue is [Coinbase Multisig Vault]( is neither of these. He lets his hatred of Coinbase prevent his understanding of what services they actually provide.

Most businesses survive on cash flow, not long term holding of investments. They cannot afford to tie up $10,000 in bitcoin hoping to cash out 3 years from now for $100,000. They have bills to pay now.  As more B2B merchants accept bitcoin they would gladly pay for business needs with bitcoin so they do not have to pay the 1% fee to convert back to fiat.  As bitcoin adaption increases businesses will have more incentive to hold it for a few days or weeks because they can pay their xyz bill when it comes due in bitcoin. Oh and they save 1% on xyz bill because they paid in bitcoin? Even better.

Okay, let me break this down in simpler terms. Not for you (I know you'll never be convinced) for others reading this.   
Let's say you have a restaurant. It sells tacos and hamburgers. After the first month you notice you are selling twice as many tacos as hamburgers. After the second month you are selling three times as many tacos as hamburgers. After month three, you are selling four times as many tacos as hamburgers.  Both are growing in sales but tacos sales are growing much faster.  
Now your local health inspector pays you a visit. He says you must invest $5,000 in a new, slower hamburger bun maker to be compliant with health codes.  You get the feeling that this is not the only time the health inspector will be back, forcing you to "upgrade" to slower equipment to sell hamburgers. You look down the street and there are five other restaurants selling hamburgers. Most of them sell many more hamburgers than you do. None of them sell tacos.  Hell, they aren't even Mexican. Their tacos would suck even if they tried.
Now you've got $10,000 in the bank to invest in the business. A new taco machine that will increase your taco production capacity by 10x costs $5,000. A newspaper ad for your tacos costs $2,500.
The reason why you don't have a successful business u/Pink-Fish, is because your dumb ass would buy the hamburger bun maker. Because Hur dee dur, you don't want to piss off the hamburger customers.

Being a bitcoin custodian / exchange adds legal and regulation complexities to the business. That takes resources away from the side of their business that was growing much faster (payments).

How about don't make daily transfers to a bitcoin exchange? This matches the profile of a money service business. A bank is going to shut you down if you match the profile an unlicensed money service business. They don't need proof. It doesn't make them evil. They just don't want to loose their job on the chance that you are not what you say you are.

You are harming Bitcoin when you have the opportunity to help. Think about what you are asking. "Dell should have 100% of their reps trained on Bitcoin BEFORE they accept it".  
Never going to happen. I'll tell you what will happen. In the next staff meeting that Bitcoin is brought up in, that rep is likely to not be a fan. They could have been our voice inside Dell that said "I didn't get it first but actually a customer walked me through it, and now I realize how simple it is".

Your argument is that there is not a stringent need for scaling without spam attacks because over the last few days blocks were not full.  
Point 1: Many business models that were being developed had to stop because the transactions per second would not increase in the foreseeable future.  
Point 2: if Segwit and LN were deployed 2 years ago, do you think we would still be at the same transaction volume we are at today?
  
Point 3: transaction volume dropped significantly over the last few days because everyone has been told not to spend coins or you may lose them during the fork.

I lost $500 in litecoin when bter got hacked for the same reason. Had Google Authenticator installed but not backed up, lost my phone and couldn't access bter. So I left the coins on the exchange and figured I deal with it later. Then they get hacked, coins are gone.

I'm with you here. I think the biggest long term threat to bitcoin is governments banning it because it is destabilizing their economy. I don't know that it would go to zero if a few governments banned it but it would drain a lot of fiat as law abiding citizens didn't want to touch it.

I think you're missing my point. The point is just because something makes a good store of value, doesn't mean law abiding citizens will use it if it is illegal.  Bitcoin will be made illegal in weak countries if its only function is a store of value. If law abiding citizens don't use it, the market cap of bitcoin will go down.

Price will find an equilibrium with supply and demand. If bitcoin is banned the average person will not use it as a store of value.

What about all the companies that stopped developing on the BTC blockchain because there was no way to process more than 7 transactions per second?

Coinbase is not popular on r/bitcoin because their CEO Brian Armstrong has publicly supported scaling bitcoin using "big blocks" and the most common opinion on r/bitcoin is to stay with smaller blocks and scale using SegWit and Lighting Network. If you don't know what small or big blocks are, google them, there is plenty of info out there. Basically its two different ways to enable the network to process more transactions per second.  
Coinbase as a company is generally accepted as a "Bitcoin Bank" and a pretty good one at that. However if you are using Bitcoin for libertarian or illegal reasons you may object to using them because you have to trust them not to turn your activities over to the fed.

This is a supplier I have used for over a year and have built a solid relationship with some trust built up for various reasons. We are talking about a payment a fraction of the size of a typical payment to them. Their Paypal account has recently been shutdown, and my $36 payment refunded. I have never come on this strong about btc, not even close to it. A few months ago I asked if they accepted it, got a no. Later we had a delay with a payment, asked again, mentioned "no fees and pays in minutes", asked boss again, got a no. I asked why, and was told "its not very good". Now Paypal shuts their account down and this conversation happens.  Point is, these guys are on the hunt for a new payment solution, and they kind of trust me.

It's not at their discretion to "think" if they want to keep their job.  It's similar to the store clerks that have to check ID's of anyone under 30 for alcohol or cigarettes. It could be a setup transaction. It could get reviewed under audit a few months from now. If management doesn't make it very clear that you are not to "think", you are not to use "discretion", you are to follow the rule book or you get FIRED, the company will get slapped with fines a few times your annual salary or lose their liquor license.  So yeah it might be annoying to you, but it might also cost someone a few hundred thousand dollars.

In the developed world where credit cards are easily accessible to most people, the transaction network of Bitcoin is not all that useful. Many of these people who hold Bitcoin do so because it allows them to store money outside their government's financial system. People buy gold for the same reason. The government can't print more gold or Bitcoin. I expect to see the payment network of Bitcoin to get traction in developing countries where credit cards and bank accounts are more difficult to get, but that will take a few more years.

IMHO netflix will not use bitcoin until it supports subscription billing or competition forces them to. The profit model of businesses like netflix is Lifetime Customer Value. How much money can we get per customer per month, for how long. There is too much risk that pay per view bitcoin payments would cannibalize stable recurring revenue streams.  
If streamium were to prove the model and started taking serious market share away from netflix then they would/should jump in before its too late. I do not see them being a first mover here though.

Saving 10% is a strong incentive to install software. Also I think buying would eventually be possible with a browser. People who don't have access to credit cards or bank accounts won't mind installing some software.

I did a side by side comparison of amazon's checkout page and purse's checkout page and on a $100 order I saved like $0.37. Not even worth my time transferring the wish list at that point.

Do you think the DAO hacker would have stolen testnet coins?
@_date: 2017-04-26 23:30:29
Bug bounties and testnets  are useful but not silver bullets. A hacker is not going to release a zeroday on a testnet. They may sell the zeroday on a bug bounty they may not. They may release the zeroday on litecoin to get $x million of litecoin rather than risk the exploit being fixed before the code gets rolled to Bitcoin. They may not. Security is about layers and risk reduction. Risks can not usually be economically eliminated.

Yeah I can only see myself using it if it was a high ticket item that I didn't need quickly. If I can save $20-30 I might give it a shot. Problem is so now many orders get canceled, buyers flake etc that you have to include a hassle factor.

Okay agreed. The scale of this got out of hand. Billions with a B is going to be difficult. The point is waiving wire fees for large account holders is not difficult. Having the ongoing relationship with you is much more valuable than waiving a fee here or there to earn your business. Especially if you're taking an account from a competitor. The power of bitcoin lies in being permissionless and decentralized. Not because I can send a few million dollars for next to nothing. That's what those coins were worth when they were sent.

[edit: u/audigex and u/blueskysyellowteeth are right, I was wrong. Trading one coin for another coin is a taxable event] 
Is you think the price of BTC is going to go down, you may be tempted to sell your coins and then buy back in at a lower price. However if you cash out to fiat, you owe capital gains tax (in some countries like the US). If you convert to etheruem, you take risk etheruem is going to go down as well. Maybe even more than BTC. Tether is pegged to USD. So you can cash out to tether, avoid the taxable event and buy back in when you think it has bottomed out.  However tether maybe a scam and crash completely according to some recent reports. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:42:58

Most people in the US could give a shit about decentralized blockchains either, they are in it to make money off a speculative investment. Once enough infrastructure is built out, people hold it, use cases get built out people still won't give a shit about decentralized blockchains.

Right now Bitcoin's biggest use case is as an exit from government fiscal controls. There are many people in the USA that want to do that. We all have internet and we all have smartphones, so it makes sense that we are one of the largest early adopters.

This is a dev kit. Think about when this is embedded in devices for $20 or less. I don't need that device to support a wallet. I don't need to setup banking or merchant processing accounts. I don't need to load it up with bitcoin for it to start writing to the blockchain. I don't need to worry about miners not accepting my low fee transactions.  
Sure most of these things are accessible through other means. Just like we all had access to computer, the internet &amp; GPS in the 90's. But having them all in your pocket for $200 enables tremendous innovation.    
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:17:32

Until we get to apple pay ease of use, bitcoin will not be popular in bricks and mortar retail environments. Bitcoin will scale in areas that are cumbersome, expensive or impossible with existing payment technologies. Such as openbazaar, augur, remittances, micro-payments, digital goods etc. Then it will begin to take hold in areas that are very well established with with existing technologies.

"We recognize that ads pay for most of our web content. Ads are not going away. So we replace the bad ads with Brave Ads"  
Won't these ads suck because they have very little target, so the click through on them will be low, so the incentive for advertisers to use the network will be low.  
I could be wrong but I thought the point of Brave was to get paid small amounts of bitcoin to surf the web and have no ads as a paid option. Advertisers pay and content creators, Brave, and visitors all get a cut. If you want to pay for no ads then that's an option as well.  I'm just not seeing why the advertisers would choose Brave as a part of the ad spend if all I know is my ad is going to get shown on CNN.com

When a new block is found the miner who found it is rewarded with bitcoin. Every 210,000 blocks the mining reward drops by half. This means roughly every 4 years the new coins created is reduced by 50%. It started at 50 coins in 2009, there was a halving in 2012 down to 25 coins. In 2016 it halved again to 12.5. It is projected to halve again to 6.25 coins per block on [June 14, 2020](

@_date: 2017-05-04 02:28:34
If you believe in the technology and are buying for the long term, now is a good time to buy. Understand that it may drop significantly in price over the next few months, but you're in it for the long term so short term price fluctuations shouldn't bother you much. 
On the other hand if you don't really understand or care about the technology and are just looking to make a good return on your investment in the next six months, it's never a good time to buy bitcoin. Go to Vegas instead. You'll have more fun and likely end up with the same financial result.

I agree Qualcomm is on board to embed a security chip but I don't think reducing confirmation times is really going to drive adoption. I hope that is not core to their strategy. User incentive is still too low for the average American. They don't want to have to buy something, so they can buy something else.  
But if they can earn BTC, even small amounts, $10, $20 a month. Now the game has changed. They only have to spend it. This is the problem I hope they are working on.

This is a solution for stand beside POS. Most merchants already have a stand beside device and are locked into contracts with it. This is not a way to upgrade those devices to support bitcoin, its a replacement for their existing stand beside that adds bitcoin support.
