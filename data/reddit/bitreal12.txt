i am actually starting my 6th day with a similar fee. 
you'll need at least 200sat/b to get it confirmed in the same day from now on .. if i only knew this 6 days ago
so yeah unless you see the above transaction get confirmed soon, til that time this will tell you what to expect

me and you together bro. i paid exactly 110 sat/b on 48hours ago(at that time the regular transaction was 110sat/b but on the same day some weird shit started going on and it got stuck.) 
if i am not mistaken it should get confirmed within 90 hours total so 2 more days or so 
use this site to see how much more time will it take for it to go through (estimate)

you see the problem with bitcoin you cant exactly expect when to get a confirmation. 
for example :  
why make people wait a whole week ? its just ridiculous and broken and in the same time if that extra $5 will make the transaction get confirmed in the same day then idk
