Person who got ripped is responsible sadly. This could have never happened if you did a simple thing as doing research or asking questions in the LBC community forum.

bitcoin to the moon and back to earth then halfway back to the moon. I think I'll sell while its on the moon and buy it back when on earth.

I agree. Renting out a room for the event wouldn't be too expensive.

not any of the actual trader's who do it for a living. only asshole's who use the DNM to exploit people. Coinbase=no anonymity. Research and asking questions would have gotten you more informed on common scams and how to prevent them. sad to say but you pay to learn and life isn't free. I've been scammed big time starting out. Did that effect me? Yes, because I learned from it and know how to NOT trade again and multiple ways to NOT get scammed. Its VERY easy. but as the saying goes "a sucker is born every minute"

If LBC has a lot more people in the UK and there weren't as strict reg's on BTC trading there we would possibly do so.

coinbase is shit. absolute collusion with the gov't and IRS. LBC = different company/different country that doesn't report what you may buy or sell using coinbase and/or what you use your bitcoins for.

I doubt the ETF would have that much of a HUGE effect. Yes of course always there is panic trader's which affect the market. But large traders make up for the panic trader's. Panic trader's are people who aren't true believer's in the tech and the endless possibility of it. If PBOC can't keep it under 1k I doubt the ETF can either.

I highly recommend not using PAYPAL or INTERAC-E. There are so many ways to buy/sell without a bank account. Coinbase = 0 anonymity and reports to IRS so be prepared to pay tax's on any capital gains.

Sorry this happened to you. If you would have done proper research before trading you'd have been fine. Always read a user's feedback. If your willing to use paypal(known in the bitcoin community the devil's choice for bitcoin trading) because its reversible as is the way you used. Find another method. Their are TONS! Which makes it better than coinbase. Also if you use coinbase expect to receive your information given to the IRS therefore nulling any privacy you think you had. Don't know hundreds if not thousands of traders like myself as scammer's because you got scammed from not doing research or asking to be taught a lesson which many traders teach this common knowledge. Paying a SMALL amount to learn to not lose BIG money from getting scammed by method's like this. Good luck to you I wish you the best.

Use the community forums. There is mostly the top of the top trader's there who honestly are there for good intentions to teach new trader's from preventing scams. Some also charge little bit but it pays off 100% without a doubt. I lost 16k back in 2013. I've WELL earned that back and more but I learned from my loss. I suggest using the forum's. I'd be happy to trade with you if you are located in the USA. My LBC profile is:
if my ad isn't up open a local one letting me know your interested. I will have to do some basic KYC(know your customers) so I can prevent myself from being scammed but feel free to post on the forums anytime with any questions. You'll get informed and great info. best of luck
