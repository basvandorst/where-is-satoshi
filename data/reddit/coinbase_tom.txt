At this point, it's no longer possible to move BTC out of Coinbase as we have disabled sends/receives in preparation for the fork.

[Coinbase here]( We definitely want to make sure you have access to your funds as soon as possible. Could you PM me with your Case # and/or account email?

We hear you! We're adding a ton of resources very quickly to scale up to the new levels of interest that crypto &amp; Coinbase are experiencing. We are trying to prioritize incoming requests as best we can, and I'm sorry for the long wait. You should see our response times getting better and better over the coming weeks. I'm not on Reddit all the time and can't handle every case personally, but I try to keep an eye out for threads that indicate a serious or wide-scale issue.
