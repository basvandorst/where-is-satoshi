It's gonna need more than this.
Or alternatively - it just can't manage to happen. 'Regular' people are simply too complacent and uninterested.

Such high prices are not that hard to believe..
..As long as it's already premised that this insanely improbable event did take place - Of the world's fiat-entrenched, tradition-bound institutions, governments, big corporations all supporting cryptocurrency because of some absolutely -aberrant- change (we're talking almost alien-invasion-level of aberration, here ;p) to the status quo of world finance, economics &amp; the fundamental mass global usage limitations of Blockchain Technology that still remain so far.
What's *actually* interesting, rather, is figuring the earliest time a change this drastic might take place - 2019..? 2024..? 2031..?
&amp; What's actually important to each of us now, is to make sure to be well aware relying on price to reach those heights is no different from buying a bunch of lotto tickets at the local grocery store.

The author's sharp, deadly, accurate Devil's Advocate work dispelling all the myths about "needing scaling so BTC can transact well - it's a primary purpose" is just so enthralling.
Suddenly, the whole debate is turned on its head and all the widely bemoaned deadlocks, politicized governance/ideology drama, resistance to change, actually are framed as ***features*** - it's pure gold.
All those people you see every single day asking in the sub "How/where to **buy bitcoin**", "Is it a good time to buy now - **when is the next crash**", "Do I have enough - Should I buy more, I am another greedy fool who just wants to **jump in a bandwagon, Get Rich Quick without studying the underlying technology's world-changing possibilities**.." *(lol =P)*
I mean can it be any more obvious almost all the newcomers are simply treating this as an investment, no different than a vulgar *Pink Sheets hot stock pick* to buy and then hopefully dump later when the price is higher - not as a medium to actually make use of - so why not focus on that then..?

Bitcoin does not need a pump, a dump, or mass adoption. And the latter was never happening anyway, not as the technology currently exists, based on how this world works.
But for those who seek a potential solution to indeed usher in such increased user adoption, the following is needed : 
More convenience *especially for new users* in learning how to use and secure cryptocurrency ; More convenience *especially for new users* in acquiring (buy/earn) cryptocurrency ; More convenience *especially for new users* in having many more robust avenues available to spend, trade, exchange, and use cryptocurrency.

He is absolutely spot on regarding that last referenced post, in both of the points he makes.
Yes, it is possible to reliably expect (sometimes things will rarely go really bad, it's never a certainly, obviously) to deposit onto a well-reputed dice site, with years of experience in PRNG median-spotting strategy, and actually emerge with profit, and withdraw it to your own wallet to spend/keep, `before` you lose everything.
The edge will make you lose everything over a very long period of time, but 99%+ of gambling player balances are lost way before this occurs, not due to house edge, but because it is psychologically incredibly difficult not to lose control at the extreme variance swings in rolls outcomes and just start betting terminally risky %-slices of one's available betting balance, leading to 'bust'.

You can accept BTC for PayPal with less than ~0.5% chance of being scammed like this^
On PaxFul, LocalBitcoins - as long as the trader you're dealing with has 100+ positive trades score, and 0 negative trades.
Because almost invariably, the cost of them lying to PayPal (that it was unauthorized use of their funds, to get chargeback $) is *higher* than the cost of losing access to their 100+ reputation which allows them to continue offering trades at great commission % advantage to them.
When does this stop being true..? Why did this scammer in the OP's case decide to actually ditch his account's 100+ positive P2P trades' record..?
Because when you take ~$300+, especially in this case - $1075+, and you wave it in front of an obvious internet / H culture child w/ an uncapitalized, unprofessional username such as "inf3rno", tempting them to calculate the value of getting $1075 back from PayPal, vs. the value of their 100+ positive trades ID-/FB-verified P2P Trader's account ; you're toying with fire and tipping the scale of the incentive system the LB/PaxFul reputation scores were meant to support ;///
Think about it for a second. **Of course** $1k+ is vastly more valuable than 100+ reputation, especially amongst an *ocean* of 500-10000+ reputation veteran traders to compete against w/ one's offer ads - *and even then* it is *very* unwise to tempt **anyone** with more than a $150 prize (per trade) for lying to PayPal.

@ 300++ sat per byte recommended fee, that's absolutely an all-time-high..rofl. Definitely not gonna make it palatable for bitcoin faucet sites to send out users' cashouts.
Issue is that these sites work using ad traffic revenue.
And in cryptospace, since Google AdWords cracked down on this, the money is really scarce for ad revenue. So you can't afford to just "go all-in altcoin-ad-network-funded banners/video ads + altcoin user faucet".
You can migrate your faucet into giving altcoin balances and withdrawals (cheaper transactions/faster tx..un-backlog'd blockchains........) allllllll you want, it will NOT solve your main issue - revenue for the site.
For this to work, switching over all the big faucets to altcoins and bye-bye-btc-blockchain-problems, CoinAd and the other few main crypto ad traffic service providers would all have to switch to altcoin payments to the faucet webmasters - who in turn use that to pay out their users' wallet withdrawals.
Or - they would have to find some fiat-based traditional web marketing ad traffic revenue providers that **don't** discriminate against crypto faucets as being "just money-making hollow webpages with no meaningful content" (which is Google's stated problem with it) and then use said fiat ad revenue to buy some altcoin balances and distribute it to their faucet users during cashouts.

I appreciate your reasonable skepticism.
Ethereum has given 3000% returns over past 2 years. If the price vs. BTC goes up majorly even while BTCUSD also quintupled since early last year, do the math, what will the ETHUSD appreciation look like, even if it's (wisely) only 20% of your "$5k" portfolio..?
Whether one wisely bought on the run-up during Homestead hype cycle, then sold at a probable peak, then repeated it during this current pre-Metropolis hype cycle right now ; or whether they simply held some ETH the entire time.
Those 3000% type of opportunities with less than ~5-10% chance of losing most of your money (giant protocol flaw or whatnot) don't re-occur all the time. It's a 1-2x per decade type of development, even in crypto. But just a single 6-15x out of that gain, allows to compensate for any number of "bad" "all I got from AAPL this year was a measly ~14% YoY".
There IS more than 70% YoY **average** return on cryptocurrency investments. To compensate / over-average-out the limited gains from already overvalued tech stocks' performance. If bought reasonably low, and sold at a probable high. Be right more often, and make more money, than when you're wrong, and you'll net compounding gains well over 100% YoY easily.
Take BTC price for instance. Was it foolish to buy at $1300 months ago? Maybe it could've been. In our timeline, turns out it wasn't. Was it stupid to sell at $900? Maybe. Turns out it wouldve been bad. But IF you bought below $2k. Would you not sell now? Foolish not to secure those profits.
We're talking 25-60% dips. Nobody can reliably time micro- and mini-dips. But gigantic upswings and downturns..? You could be "wrong" and have sold at $2200 and it went to $2800 or even $3200, before coming back down in a "crash" to $2100, and you'd still have made solid money from $1XXX's into $2200 then from ($2350 maybe? you didn't know whether it would hit $2100 or not) into $2800 and the like. Maybe you hold that coin bought @ $2350 until all the way to $4000, maybe it dips further to $1000 instead. 
But the less you panic buy on a run-up, and less you panic-sell on a crash, the more you patiently wait to get in AFTER it crashed substantially and only sell AFTER it went up solidly, you're really helping your chances at having timed it as best you could, in hindsight.

[You answered your own question](
Large scale adoption has arrived at last, for the entire cryptocurrency space, so the high fees are here to stay &amp; will [get worse and worse]( as the [hype &amp; demand for digital assets intensifies](
Yet none of that means you can't transact relatively cheaply. Even in Bitcoin. Just pay [.0005B or ~210-240 satoshi per byte for your average basic size tx]( and it will confirm in under an hour. No problem there.
Of course it's unfortunate we are experiencing this deadlock over governance/policy priorities, and would be much better if fees were more affordable. Good thing that either via UASF or other ways, scaling will at last come to Bitcoin, almost certainly in 2017.
Quite reasonable a fee for such an [incredibly valuable unique anti-censorship trustless store of value transfer mechanism](

Still wise to wait for the 99%-inevitable next dip though.
Not fall to FOMO.
Whether that correction turns out to be -$70 or -$350.
..But when it does happen at last.
TO **BUY**. NOT miss your chance! Without hesitation or fear. Without WEAK HANDS to let go of it when it goes back up a little - or **especially** - if it continues downward for a while.
And then to hold. Patiently, for the loooong haul.
Until one day..
We reach another price peak and you recall with a blithe smile, the stress of holding, the doubts, uncertainties, and the reward you now collect for your patience and discipline - of a *properly, soundly timed entry* and *judicious exit point*.

Doesn't need to be a currency.
It's a store of value. Immune from state/bankster interference.
That makes it's inability to be used to buy bananas efficiently, irrelevant.
Don't need no suckers if it's purpose and functioning as a STORE OF VALUE continues to be proven effective for years and years as it has.

Typically you'd expect 6-to-8-digit answers to this type of question..
Yet the unsung truth is that in reality, $5000 is a life-changing-potentiated amount, even in the most expensive Western world economies.
Because you can &amp; should invest it. Use normal job income/welfare/student scholarship/etc to survive/pay your living expenses.
..While your $5000 is [growing exponentially]( at a relatively slow &amp; steady pace, in a diversified mix of (sorted by ideal weighting) : 
~&gt; The [top volume/most professional dev-team'd crypto's]( ; 
~&gt; The largest tech sector stocks with the best future cases (GOOG | AMZN | FB /../ possibly AAPL / TSLA / NFLX) ; 
~&gt; Some gold/silver low-leverage margin trading positions on forex platforms *(physical metal acquisitition &amp; storage will not be practical - since we're dealing with sub-$5k)*, ~and the cheapest best-value judiciously-future-regional-growth-researched real estate properties you can find~ *(&lt;Real estate yes, but only once your initial $5000 has developed over several years into 6-digits+ of course. Since houses have a large minimum cost)*.
*At a weighted average of ~1.7x or +70% per* **year** *it should be a reasonable enough sustained growth expectation - IF selling the tops and buying the bottoms as best as one can, even if doing many subpar choices along the way - every 6-18 months, 1 trade, that's it ;* [*Enter 1.7 under* **'Base'**, *10 under* **'Exponent'**]( *and your result will show 20160% over a decade (10y) - turning $5000 into 1 million dollars*.

Not one place in crypto can be as trusted as say, some hyper-regulated federally-insured traditional finance firm like TD Ameritrade or Bank of America - The best thing you can hope for is [Circle Internet Financial]( [BitStamp Exchange]( &amp; [Gemini Exchange]( *(because they're fully, officially regulated in their respective host countries' laws, insured, and have very strong near-unanimous reputation among the community for being reliable - in BitStamp's case, for half a decade)*
[CoinDesk]( has some of the best information to get started - yet are biased pro-/pump-BTC, as well as pro-altcoin in many cases. 
[Coinbase]( is regulated but has many problems often reported, along with having a bruised reputation in the community for various reasons.
If you're asking which peer to peer traders and which smaller scale &amp;/or bitcoin lending income/bitcoin pyramid/"passive interest" services can be *'trusted'* - forget it, the minute you get into loans, ponzi's, cloud mining, residual income of any sort - there is *nothing* regulated or *'use this at little risk'* in the space right now, any use requires full *caveat emptor*.

Indeed, it's illogical, unviable &amp; suicidal for a state to confer legal tender status to a decentralized currency ledger system over which they hold no monopoly of force or monetary policy control.
That's similar to why gold or any other commodity, even petroleum, has not ever been legal tender - no monetary policy for the powers to have hegemony over. The modern state's mandate is incompatible with decentralization.
When/if a government goes blockchain, they do so via centralized, permissioned ledgers, enforced-pegged 1:1 to their national fiat currency. No volatility/trading profitability potential, no trustlessness, no real use to us.
Sure it would be *nice* if they could "get in BTC / pump us to the moon!!11!1", obviously, but that dream, by definition, stands outside of what is fundamentally possible.

Sure does.
Those services are meant for premium, whale or near-whale-level of transaction value.
For more regular tx's, cheapest way to maintain total deniability &amp; even 99.99%+ obfuscation (as if you had indeed tumbled the coins) is to send them to an exchange address. BitStamp, BitFinex, BitTRex, etc. Then you withdraw your coins from the exchange.
Coinbase indeed sees you sent to that well-known exchange wallet address you always use - it's well tagged as yours, and as belonging to that exchange. But afterwards, when you click withdraw? The coins do NOT come out of that address. They come out of the **exchange's hotwallet** which may be any one of hundreds of addresses they use for this, and will almost always be paired with other customers' withdrawal amounts to merge into bigger tx's than just the portion with your money. So, complete obfuscation.
The only drawback with this non-owned-privkey-based 'hoop' is the delay, the extra tx fee (only BitFinex charges 0 for withdrawals, others do) and of course, the exchange counterparty risk..which honestly, has proven *very* limited in the past 3-5 years of these respected sites' operations.

To answer your perennial question, ask yourself which of the 2 groups of people are easier for a given tyrannical coercive government body to hijack and exploit to attack/seize/censor those developers' corresponding blockchains :

The *"..private island bought with crowdfunded money &amp; declared a sovereign state.."* is still indeed bound to a certain [group of G7] countries, with certain laws and obligations, to pay tribute/taxes to and recognize/comply with the sovereign power of the United States, China, the EU (I mean Germany and France), etc ; Meanwhile this 'Bitcoin Island Nation' isn't recognized itself under International Law at the UN, just as [the Principality of Sealand]( is certainly not recognized as a legitimate sovereign state by any G20 country, and beyond.
These modern governments are self-perpetuating extortive power cartels with a tight control over their legalized monopoly of force and hegemony over land ownership rights. They won't let people just spring out from under them and potentially jeopardize this overwhelming monopoly of power they have.

LOL 1 step and they won't chain-analyze that? Of course they do. In that comical statist regulation pre-emptive paranoia scramble of theirs.
But, send to an **exchange** (bittrex, bitfinex &gt; polo, kraken) wallet address of your account there, then withdraw as normal which will come from any one of their thousands of hotwallet addresses, and BAM..!!
You just tumbled your coin almost -completely- out of trackability for the minute, worth-it cost of just ~$0.50-$3 in extra withdraw/tx fees.
Go one step of magnitude further than this if desired, by taking the opportunity, once your BTC landed on the exchange, to transfer (buy) into some liquid major altcoin with the entire BTC balance, then wait ~12 hours, then re-transfer the funds (sell) from said major altcoin balances, back into BTC, and withdraw *then*.
