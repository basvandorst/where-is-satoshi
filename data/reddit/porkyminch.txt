Yeah, and then that Michael Hastings guy seemed to have some interesting information on them, but then his car just mysteriously wouldn't brake and he died in a fiery accident... Funny how that works out.

After WWII a bunch of Nazi scientists were recruited for various projects, many of which were run by the CIA and FBI.  MKUltra is believed to be a big one. Also NASA. So, uh, technically they don't have to repeat it.

Also Satoshi who has like a fuckton of coins that he could use to devalue the entire market at his pleasure. Which is much more power than a CEO has.

Yeah dude, have fun when BTC tanks and you can't do shit to hedge your losses because crypto both doesn't have derivatives and is heavily pegged to the price of BTC.

It's possible, but to keep filesize down you'd probably have to limit it to an ethernet connection. That and wireless drivers aren't typically FOSS.

45% is fucking awesome for a hedge fund. That's stable as fuck.

Seriously, you lost money in a market that just keeps going up. Panic selling is fucking moronic.

Either way, we're headed for a drop, man. I bet it pops by the year's end.

You fucked up. Give her all the money, except whatever you need to visit a psychologist for a while. Seriously, you're a fucking moron if you thought it was a good idea to buy at $800 a coin. Even if you would've bought at $600 you'dve been able to profit, but you were an idiot and wasted  your sister's future because you thought you had a good opportunity to get rich despite a shitload of evidence to the contrary. Own up to it like a man.

Holy shit, I didn't even see that he *sold* it. If he would've waited like a fucking day he could've gotten almost all his money back.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:28:47
It's your fuck-up, not hers. Own up to your mistakes, kid. Everyone knew it wasn't staying at $800, that shit's ridiculous.

Thank you for being reasonable. This sub is a total circlejerk, bitcoin will never be stable enough to be an effective currency, and more than likely this growth is a bubble. A bubble is not a good thing.
