SO bye bye 25 BTC per new block, and instead look for more transaction fee as a miner.

I do not think this is a fair Apples to Apples comparison.  If you are comparing Segwit to a non Segwit transaction, the only way to compare fee is to count the UTXOs making up the transaction.  Eventually all fees is computed as Satoshis/byte, and if for some reason Segwit address has a lot of UTXOs, much larger than that of a non-Segwit address, you will not be able to save fees.
Segwit removes the witness data from the transaction, so in effect it makes the transaction size smaller =&gt; lower fees.  However if the no. of UTXOs is large, this may not really lead to any saving.

No financial advisor or mutual fund will EVER recommend BTC cos they have no incentive to do so (no commissions!).  Also BTC is taking money away from investments in which advisors make commissions!

So why do you think 21co cannot allow you to set up a monthly payment within a defined limit (say $10) automatically?
For $10 it may not work out, but if you are spending $1000 a month maybe it makes sense?

I am not so sure about the banks that are embracing blockchain are really "pegged into the Bitcoin Blockchain."  I would rather guess they are creating shared databases for doing what blockchain essentially does today.

Yes its a valid point, coming from a banking org so more like a conflict of interest.

If you cannot trust 21co or the provider of the API for the quality of the data they return this will never be in the game.
"Handling payments is hard work" - exactly why 21co is making it all available via API.

In my view the "bandwidth cost" of keeping the node up to date is around 25GB/month.

"I really don't think the current intermediaries are in a position to do anything about it without shooting themselves in the foot and accelerating the whole process away from them."
Intermediaries will fight back and the acceleration you talk of sometimes takes ages.

In my experience the CPU on my laptop was able to cope up but the download of the data was the bottleneck/took time.  
@_date: 2015-11-23 12:04:35
I run a full bitcoin node on my laptop (not for mining purposes - I assume you are also not planning to mine anyways with the EC2).  I have ubuntu LTS 14.04 and used the software from  (bitcoin core).  The bitcoin-cli runs fine on it (which I am assuming is your gateway to block parser).
The only major issue I faced are:
* It takes a while to download the full blockchain (there are alternatives to do that using a torrent)
* It sucks a lot of bandwidth to keep the blockchain current.  I would guess you would probably use data worth around 20-30GB/month in order to run the full node - so you need to be on an unlimited broadband plan if you are a heavy user of data otherwise. 
In my view there is no reason why you cannot use this on Windows or Mac machines.
Going to EC2 is probably an overkill, but again depends on your use case.

From my blog post 
*Why use Raspberry Pi for the hardware when I can so the same using my own computer or a laptop? Why would anyone in their right mind pay 400 dollars for a raspberry pi + an API wrapper?*
The 21Inc Bitcoin Computer is a fully functional bitcoin miner, a full bitcoin node and a micro-payments server. It has been rightly pointed about by many others that it is not economical using it as a standalone bitcoin miner – one source says you will be able to mine only $38 worth of bitcoins a year, and even that is not certain. 21 Inc has also acknowledged this fact. Another source says that the hardware included with this device is only worth $250 and thus the $399 is actually the price of the hardware + the included API and micro-payment server.
In my view the aim of 21 Inc is to enable hobbyists and developers come on to the blockchain and start using the (21 Inc + bitcoin) ecosystem to create applications and trade on it via micropayments. 21 Inc is maybe aiming to create a bitcoin platform on which a lot of applications are built using their APIs. If there are a lot of people having the 21 Inc device, it would be very easy for them (with the right kind of applications built on top) to transact with each other using bitcoins for micropayments. At this point in time, to my knowledge, there is no single platform which enables bitcoin transactions using a standard API which allows applications to be built on top of it without charging any transaction fee (happy to be corrected if wrong).
Ok so why not build a library of APIs and publish it instead of selling a piece of hardware? The issue with that is that it will have to integrate with a host of bitcoin wallets where the end users will end up paying a transaction fee. It will still not address the issue of privacy and anonymity (as the wallet provider knows who you really are).
If this device gets smaller and faster (which it should with time due to Moore's law) then you could potentially plug it to your cellphone or refrigerator as a USB drive and thus enable e-commerce on this basis. In the future, this will also enable the IOTs (Internet of Things).
In my view bitcoin micropayments with minimal transaction fees is the key objective of this device.
*When there is hardly any Bitcoins I can mine using this device, then what's the difference between using this computer and running a full node on a normal computer? Why include a miner in this in the first place?*
Let us look at the alternatives of being able to mine (remember that the 21 Inc computer is a full bitcoin node, meaning it is a miner and wallet rolled into one):
If we have an API sitting over the top of a bitcoin wallet enabing payments, we have no anonymity and privacy. There will be an additional transaction fee which will be a killer deal for micropayments. In fact this is not a viable option as using a wallet means you have handed over your details to the “centralized” wallet provider who can track each and every payment you send or receive. You can also look at an option of using multiple such 21 Inc computers which you use to be truly anonymous and decentralized instead of hooking yourself on to a central wallet.
Using your computer to mine bitcoins on its own and take/send payments is possible, however you will have to set up a micropayments server and wallet to get started, which leads to issues as I described above for the wallet, and challenges in setting up a micropayment server to work with minimal transaction fee. A developer does not need to spend 20-25 hours setting this up and then buying bitcoins from other sources, which is worth atleast $150 in time saved – the assumed saving you can make if you go the DIY route.
The most important reason in my view to include a miner is to enable a large ecosystem of miners which will process micropayments at nearly zero cost. Most miners will not process micropayments today and this will mean tha those transactions are delayed and slow. The 21 Inc computer will enable a lot of mining power to be allocated for micropayments.

Gold coins are valuable (have monetary value in $), and buying/selling them incurs fees in $.
Would you invest in gold for this reason?  I think that's what the original premise of the discussion was.  
@_date: 2015-11-23 16:47:41


Yes you can, however this will imply that your node is not up to date with the block chain which IMHO defeats the whole point of running a full node. 
@_date: 2015-10-26 10:51:16
If something is worthwhile, does not necessarily mean you can monetize it.  Example: HTML is very valuable for the web to run, but is HTML having any intrinsic value?
BTC is different from HTML - HTML is a language while BTC has monetary value, however, generally speaking, the value of applications built on top of something is more than that of the underlying technology.  
@_date: 2015-10-26 09:13:25
In my view the question he was asked is whether one should invest in Bitcoin (aka buy and hold bitcoin). 
I would agree with his response.  As a investment is buying Bitcoin worth it? Probably not.  However if you can create applications on top of it, like you have services that monetize checks or money orders definitely worth it.

20-25 hours to:
- Install Bitcore or equivalent and download block chain.
- Search and setup/install a micropayment server.  
- Integrate the micropayment server with your bitcoin wallet.  
- Publish an API from micropayment server to send or receive bitcoins for whatever you want to do.
@_date: 2015-10-12 06:40:17
I understand I do need to get the full blockchain If I am running a full node, however there are some questions:
- From a bitcoin perspective, full nodes are good (and desirable).  Why make it so cumbersome to download 70GB odd just to get started?  Is this not a design issue (or an enhancement worth looking into)?
- How do you expect IOTs to work if you need a 70GB (and growing in the future) footprint to work as a full node running IOT?
(I think mine is around 55GB and not 70GB, but thats not the point)
@_date: 2015-10-13 03:17:48
Yes as of today full nodes need to be run on servers with adequate resources.  However in the long run, any device should be able to run a miner and make micropayments.  Going via a centralized wallet or a central payment processor is not what bitcoin should be, ideally.
@_date: 2015-10-31 07:33:41
While I would prefer Erik to respond (as he has been asked to), my take on this is that it is simply not possible for the banks to do this in the way you suggest.  
Their business model is that the intermediaries get them business for a cut of the fee.  
They simply cannot antagonize their intermediaries.  Its like saying why does Sony not sell TVs directly to consumers via online channels and let the online retailers like Amazon and eBay compete to get the best price/service to Sony customers.

@_date: 2017-07-28 06:16:11
IMHO his point is that the value of Bitcoin is dependent on how valuable others perceive it to be.  There is no intrinsic value in a Bitcoin, like there is in a stock or a warrant.

The only difference between a private blockchain and a private MySQL database would be there will be one owner of the database while there is no single owner of the blockchain.
Of course you can, in theory, make all the "vetted participants" administrators/superusers of the database, but I cannot imagine of a workable database system with 400 administrators for example.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:38:23
Thats what he is saying - Bitcoin cannot be priced in terms of what it can generate in terms of value, it is solely being valued on what others are willing to pay for it.  And that basically means that if it is a "store of value" or a "medium of exchange", it should not be so volatile.
