I like your idea, but to see that you have paid facebook to get fans and that you are not getting the buzz it needs, i don't trust your 300k sales figures. How much did you make profit on your sales? 20k-30k? And that you are in Australia which is one of the most expensive countries in selling electronics, i can't hardly believe you are actually making any profit on your sales.
I'd love to believe, but I just cant.
TL;DR; convince me otherwise

I'm totally impressed here. Good for you and your company.

David Mondrus just said the following on facebook: 
 If anyone gets in touch, please pass along this message: We have a plane standing by to evac him and his family to a safe house until he is able to convert his BTC into USD so he can hire security.
We can have Gavin or someone he knows from the old meetups on the plane.
This is officially from the Bitcoin Association
All this info can be verified here:

Thanks! Will definitely send that over for them to look at since even thought I have the majority of the shares (51%), I don't want others to get annoyed by my dealings since we just started our business and I've spent countless hours trying to make it all work on the backoffice.

Cheers. I actually encountered a lot of compatibility issues with bitpay.

Just as a sidenote, If you are here Satoshi, contact David or Gavin to get yourself to safety!

Even better, just emailed them as per other suggestion. Hope it all goes well for us as my other business partners are totally against bitcoins.
