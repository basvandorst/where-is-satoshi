Is SourceForge a nefarious site? I don't get any warnings from Google Safesite when I visit it.

I think it's some kind of metaphor for the circle of life or something. I'm not sure what it has to do with bitcoins.

I was just using it yesterday. The giant button on the top of the window looks just like a banner ad.

Dogecoin is based on Litecoin. Both Litecoin and Dogecoin use the scrypt algorithm. Litecoin is based on the Bitcoin protocol. The advantage of Litecoin is that it's supposed to provide faster transaction confirmations.
A big difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin: There is a maximum number of bitcoins that will be produced. Over time it will be harder and harder to mine more bitcoins until the last bitcoin is mined. With Dogecoin 5 billion new coins will be made available to mine every year forever. Dogecoin believes that a little bit of inflation is a good thing.

I think it's cool that pirates still exist, especially dread pirates.

Yes, the government told PayPal to temporarily block it. That way we would think that the government opposes ProtonMail, and we would believe that ProtonMail is not playing nice with the government spy agencies. But secretly the government already has an obvious backdoor hidden in ProtonMail. Although hidden, the back door was made to be easy-to-find, so that once we find and block it, we will think we're in the clear, but there is actually a second backdoor that is much more clever than the first. Furthermore, the government will be paying extra special attention anyone who who tried blocking the first backdoor. 
P.S. Every Firewall is compromised by the government, and every CPU produced today has integrated cellular chips that allow the government in at anytime. The NSA still insists the 4th amendment does not apply to it. The entire purpose of the NSA is to break the forth amendment. If they were intended to get warrants with probable cause, they would just have the police do it. /tinfoilhat

Thought this was talking about the infallible Blockchain when I read the title.

It might not be much, but I was looking forward to those 1000 bits. The value of bitcoins seems to have gone up a bit over the last couple of weeks, though.

The ATF sold guns to Mexican drug cartels – can't have a war on drugs if the drug lords go down. The war on drugs might be the most evil war since the holocaust. At least Hitler was trying to save Germany. Like many wars, the war on drugs is all about making money for those profiting from it. The war on drug is being committed by those who are supposed to be serving the common good; they aren't supposed to be lining their pockets. 
Edit: Sorry for the hyperbole.

To be fair, most Bitcoin exchanges are indeed run by younger people who are trying to keep their amateur status, but that's only so that they can qualify to exchange bitcoins in the olympics.
