You got really lucky. Normally the only thing that happens following a HOLD is that the money gets taken, it's just a matter of time.

Kind of... Escrow is really only needed for person-to-person transactions. I'm perfectly happy to pay Amazon or Netflix or Newegg or whoever before I get my goods, because I trust those companies not to fuck me over if there's a problem and I need to return it.
Normally I use a debit card with those companies, not a credit card, so I have no consumer protection at all if they do decide to screw me, but I'm comfortable with that, to be honest.
I guess that there will be a need for an Escrow service in the future, SilkRoad was the first one really, and they did a pretty decent job of it. I imagine that as more people start to use Bitcoin for Ebay, then Ebay would set something up, probably using their Paypal brand.

Quite. I think Paypal massively favours buyers and it's nice to have something like Bitcoin to redress the balance a little.

Coinbase can do whatever they like. Mangatrader can still accept BTC donations, nobody can ever stop that.

Except it is. SilkRoad 2 and a dozen other illegal marketplaces exist soley because BTC doesn't and can't discriminate as to what's "illegal" and not. Wikileaks are able to continue to accept donations through bitcoin, even though paypal, visa and mastercard would prefer that they did not.
Sure, you don't avoid the legal "ramifications", whatever those are supposed to be, but the corporations can no longer wield money as a weapon to enforce their bullshit laws, such as copyright and prohibition.

This isn't even the worst thing about using paypal.
The worst thing is that the person you sold something to can claim to have never received it, and unless you can provide postal tracking information, paypal will *automatically* refund them, taking the money right out of your account.
Either that, or the person you sold to claims that their payment card was stolen, and paypal always refund them no matter what, again taking the money right out of your account.
It's literally the worst system for sellers ever. Buyers? Yeah it's amazing, you can get shit for free.

I'm pretty sure he ran SilkRoad, and I'm pretty sure that he had an anonymous online conversation with "someone" who claimed to be a hitman.
Further than that? No. No murders or even any serious incitement to murder actually took place.

This is to add Litecoin, right?

Well we're getting into the nitty-gritty of it here. What the prosecuter will have to prove is that this was a genuine attempt to solicit murder, and not just paying off some idiot on a forum to make them go away.
I know in my heart that it was the latter, not the former, but the facts sadly do not speak for themselves in this case, and my heart has no legal authority.
If his motivation was to *actually* have the guy killed, I'm sure he wouldn't have approached his "business partner" to carry out the act. It's completely absurd.
Also, you have to understand that without naming a person, naming a location or giving a picture or any other identifying mark to the "hitman", no actual incitement to murder has actually taken place.
Further, there has to be credible intent. When my mom says "I'm going to kill you", the police can't actually arrest her for that.
If you said "Go kill Joe Swanson", and there was reason to beleive you meant it, then that's an incitement to murder.
If you said "Go kill imahotdoglol", even if you meant it, there is no identifiable information there, it's not a true "hit".
It all gets rather subtle and nuanced at this kind of level, probably too detailed for a Reddit thread.

people are getting obsessed by the "hits", neither of which took place.

I'm perfectly calm, it was a question.
