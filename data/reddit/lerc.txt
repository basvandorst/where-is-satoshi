For everyone thinking of those expensive pizzas.  You are going to be very disappointed in bitcoin, because bitcoin is a currency, and currencies don't work how you think they work. 
I'm not sure of the rate of the day in USD but for the sake of argument lets say those 10,000BTC matched $20US.   That means those Pizzas cost $20.  The later value of bitcoin is irrelevant.    Trading currency for goods gets you goods.   If you do a fair trade on the day you get your moneys worth.  What things do after that doesn't matter.
This is obvious if you consider that anyone (including the purchaser of the Pizza) with $20 could have gotten a similar amount of bitcoin at the time.   
Money only delivers its value to you when you spend it.

Presuming the earth cannot support 1 person per square meter, the graph will not keep going up.   We might be able to pick the cause of the crash (war, famine, MMORPG celibacy) but unless it the graph can be leveled off the crash is inevitable.

That's a self fixing problem.   The downfall as you call it is when the speculators give up and go away.  Even if Bitcoin is worth just a few cents afterwards, it's still useful for trade.  If $20US buys you about 1000BTC one day and 1000BTC gets you about $20US the next that is just as useful as when $20US gets you 0.1BTC and 0.1BTC gets you $20US
People may not get rich by buying lots of bitcoin, but at least people can send money from A to B. Right now I get paid royalties in many small amounts.  I could swallow quite a large level of volatility and still come out much better off than using bank transfers with all their associated gouging.

As long as the Float has the precision to handle the defined range of bitcoin values it is sufficient for transfer purposes.   Conversion to and from integer representation would be exact (by definition, any conversion to and from Float not being exact is insufficient precision)
That is acceptable for transferral of information.  Calculations occurring upon the Float values can result in errors accumulating beyond the smallest quantum of bitcoin value.  Calculations should be fone in integer/Fixed point
Floats are not magical ways of storing arbitrary numbers, neither are they untrustworthy non-deterministic pseudo numbers that randomly lose information.

No matter which way you slice it, right now you'd be better off investing in bitcoins.  1 BTC is cheap enough that for the price of a piece of hardware you can probably buy more coins than it's going to ever mine.  if you have the hardware sitting idle already then you only have to consider power usage, which is a tougher call.
It is designed to be precisely that way. If it were easy, it would be a free money scheme and collapse into worthlessness.  If it's too hard, no-one would mine.  
As a direct result of it running a balanced system, the advantages go to the most efficient miners, this is where the big miners can get economy of scale benefits.
If you look after a lot of processing power that sits idle and you don't pay the power bill you can get free money, It wouldn't surprise me if someone gets charged for theft under those circumstances sometime in the next year.

1000 MegaCredits in a GigaCredits 
1000 GigaCredits in a BitCoin. (or make a GigaCredit = 1BTC,  depends on how cool you think GigaCredit sounds)

People can joke all they want about the crashing price or shout "Bubble" when it goes up.  The currency has a degree of volatility precisely because the volatility impacts upon it's usefulness.  As a currency to facilitate trade it is clearly capable of being worth more than it is currently, but if it keeps changing it will drop due to it being less useful for trade.
That's only something time will fix.  A sustained rise in value will come slowly,  most of the Bitcoin hype has happened this year,  It's been a crazy ride,  If bitcoin takes another 5 years to sit at above $20 for an entire year, it still will have been a meteoric rise.

Ok,  consider for a moment a person in Belarus.  If they have something, they could sell it.  If they accepted local currency, they are looking at quickly declining value.  If they accepted bitcoin thy would have an something of admittedly volatile worth, but you'd take that over certainly declining worth.

I always thought someone should set up a trust with enough funds to buy every bitcoin for a cent, along with a standing offer to buy and sell them for a cent.
That gives BitCoin a floor value.  Even if it hits that floor it still makes BitCoin useful as a trading currency since yo can still buy $50 worth and you can still sell $50 worth. 
At the moment you have a de facto form of this with the pool of people similarly minded to hubbbabubbahobo, which wouldn't provide as much stability as a fixed and open trust, but it will still cause a floor level.

I'm in a somewhat related boat.  I have people in the US who want to pay me money,  Through traditional means transfer fees accumulate to rather substantial amounts over time.  Bitcoin is the obvious solution to that but for that to work I'd rather not have to sell people on the idea of bitcoin and then get them to acquire their own.  I'd like a service where they can simply pay someone locally to someone who turns it to bitcoins and sends it to my wallet. It's a service worth paying for, Just not the ridiculous amounts banks charge for transfers.
Overall I think the difficulty in getting money to people in order to acquire bitcoin makes for a good lesson in one of the big benefits of bitcoin.   If only you had Bitcoin, you could get funds to them really easily.

Bitcoin Does not render the bulk of monetary infrastructure obsolete.   If bitcoin becomes a major world currency, keeping a wallet with significant quantities of BTC would be like Living with Piles of gold around your house.    You are free to do that but the rest of the world is free to point and laugh when someone takes it.
People would still use banks to hold their funds.  You may choose to allow a Bank to hold you money much as you do now.  You then have to trust the bank (as you do now) that they won't lose it all.  Bitcoin doesn't eliminate the possibility of these things.  Its primary effect is to eliminate control at the top level.
BTC does not fix the bottom level problems, there would still be a place for cash in a Bitcoin world.  Provided a solid mechanism to avoid counterfeiting remains possible in the future, any group can generate a quantity of physical tokens that they will honour for their stated BTC value.  Provided you trust their promise to honour (proof of a backing pool of actual BTC in trust, underwriting etc.), the tokens are tradeable as currency.

A bit is, by definition, indivisible.    I think it would be quite a mistake to define any level of unit of bitcoin to be a bit.  Even a Satoshi can be divided in principle and the protocol will quite possibly extend to support finer divisions in the future.
I don't mind millibit as an vocally friendly abbreviation of milliBitcoin. 
I still like Credit for mircoBitcoin
100 Satoshi in a Credit
1000 Credits in a milliBit
1000 milliBits in a Bitcoin.

Exactly, and a billion is probably far more than needed for that.  One Billion would be enough to buy every bitcoin at $47.
If someone set up a fund to buy bitcoin at $47 and sell them at the floating rate the price would have a floor.
Of course, at a billion dollars you wouldn't transfer money to an exchange, you'd set up your own dedicated service that was underwritten to the value of a billion, there's no need to tie up the money while it is unneeded, you just require the liquidity to be able to supply the money on demand.
There isn't any particular reason for requiring a Billion to do this.  A $21M fund could back BTC to a dollar by the same mechanism.  Then the value crashed it would top at $1 and even if it stayed there it would still make a practical medium for exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:26:56
I think you are right in that there needs to be a terminology change.   It is not something that happens easily or quickly.  There are a lot of posts saying "hey, lets use XYZ from now on"  The problem is that not everyone agrees on the XYZ and there needs to be a critical mass to make the switch.
This is a similar issue to people quoting the MtGox price.  Even those who agree that a different measure should be used have different ideas to the alternative.
I think it might be possible to make the switch if a few key points agreed to make the switch simultaneously.  It could be done almost instantly if the bitcoin foundation issued a press release, media would carry it and the for better or worse the change would be imposed.  I would prefer a more organic approach where people make the case for a denomination and nomenclature and a group of people agree based on the merits of the argument to switch simultaneously and let others follow if they agree.
For example My view is that uBTC is probably about the right denomination for a middle point but it would have to have a distinct name (like "Bitcoin" and "Satoshi").  My preference would be for the word "Credit" since that has been used as the future currency in countless forms of literature yet the value of a single Credit is not clearly entrenched allowing it to float to a natural value. 
So assuming it were agreed that a reasonable amount was   1 uBTC = "1 Credit".  Make the argument to (for example) bitcoinity, and perhaps blockchain.info  and suggest that they coordinate to switch terminology at a set time.  Rather than forcing the change on anyone,  convince a few people to change for themselves and invite others to change with them.
@_date: 2013-02-26 00:12:03
People still not getting this concept of a floor.   This isn't about buying the coins but providing the offer to buy coins.   A billion is enough to buy them all at $47.  Ideally **no one** would sell them for that but trade at a value somewhere above that knowing that should they need to they can get a known minimum return.
@_date: 2013-07-20 13:00:59
I have always thought along those lines except possibly replacing the words  "on board" with Satoshi.

This is right.  The price will be a target of focus.
If anything respond to talk about the price with a clear message that it will not go up with massive growth forever.
Talk about bitcoin finding its value.  The rises are attributable to both people assessing the worth to be higher than the current level.  As more people use bitcoin it should be worth more.  The current huge growth is being driven by an associated growth in awareness.  Once Bitcoin is known to most people (if not used) like facebook or twitter, much of the force pushing it up will subside.
Mention that there are speculators riding the wave but there is more to the price changes than day traders mucking about.
