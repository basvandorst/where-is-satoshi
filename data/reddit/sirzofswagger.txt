Not this. I have a degree, work a professional job, and don't have direct deposit. So while traditionally I am not a low income individual the bank could view me as such. Also just because something isn't immediately your problem doesn't mean it isn't a problem. You sound like you work for BOA.

So the miners have access to the data? Or they just direct the data? Yea I don't think you get it, but hey we don't even need to argue about it. I don't care if I win or not. But I think time will show that other things will utilize block chain other than crypto, and will have to incentive miners with something.

In what way? Because on growth? Actally you would just be missing out on your BK money growing, and it would be doublely bad.

Why not do something valuable like a bounty for the first person to cure cancer? Or Mars so it will at least advance society.

I completely disagree, all legit block chain are decentralized. Otherwise its just a database as you suggest, which is nothing new or exciting. But like I said you could not spoof the block chain in the way you are suggesting. You could do that to a database though.

Medical data for one. In fact ether is a block chain and not a crypto because it could be used to mine other things even if your reward is in ether.

I think you might be short shighted.

This is what I am putting my hope in to,fix the issue
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:12:52
But 45%, that's nuts
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:47:19
The whole point of a block chain is they can't do what you are suggesting. If someone had access to tamper with the block chain then bitcoin would cease to have value

49,571.31 per btc! And that's after next years xmas dip. Get your space suits boys!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:37:08
Yea I kept the btc in a wallet for my nieces and nephews, I don't expect everyone to understand what I do about crypto. They will be happy in 15 years when it pays for a year of college.

I think r/bitcoin was way to quick to jump all over them for this when the fees went up. But they do have a lot coming up, with adding 3 new alts coinbase. Informed users should be making the move to GDAX for lower fees which will have segwig integrated in the same,time,frame as coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:28:06
Wow you are so very wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:52:49
I really feel bad for the guy, he actually wanted to,make the right call on btc.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:57:25
16.5k, can't wait to see if anyone was close.

BCP does have a nice ring to it. (Quickly starts writing white pages)
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:58:01
Solid advice
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:30:51
If he gets block chain he will probably buy in
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:31:28
Yea bitcoin isnt a good gift unless you know they want it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:48:13
Sale back on!
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:26:38
Good lord they need to give you like 12 with the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:03:37
Except verification, they cant do that apparently.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:26:17
I tend to agree with him, bitcoin is just the best delivery system for people to understand block chain. Though it hasn't stopped it from being valuable.

Link is broken, unless i just don't have access to twitter
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:51:48
Odd thing happen..... "Its clearly a bubble".... Ok then sell so I can buy for cheaper. That is all thanks
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:30:46

@_date: 2019-08-02 16:11:25
Lol bcash bitch

I think its growth is gonna slow down a little from the B2X fork. Hoping for 9k by end of Jan 18.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:19:17
Okay, I could see that in regards to futures
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:11:32
Hmmmm yea it was
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:16:21
I really don't know that these hedge funds actually get and correctly apply data on crypto currency faster than every trader. If we were talking about the stock market i would agree, but in the crypto space they seem to react slowly. Meaning there is room to react before the news gets baked into the price.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:21:01
I think I am with you on that. Crash the price, it will be back.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:27:30
So I understand this was more of a hard truths of crypto article, but on the flip side what attracted you to crypto? And what do you consider the most exciting long term potential of this space?
