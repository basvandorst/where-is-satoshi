Sure. You can buy garbage for cheap, and it shows. Some of us have class though.
When i see someone walking around with a cheap pair of shoes, i instantly wonder why they value themselves so little. 
That's what everyone around you thinks when they see your $100 watch.
But also, my expensive shoes have been maintained and cared for much better than a $100 pair. After several years it's cheaper for me to have paid more up front than to replace shoddy equipment every year or two.
But you're right. I'm the dumbass.
Also, eat a dick you retard.

That's your opinion and it's your right. It's also your right to be wrong (as well as a "conceited duchebag", whatever that is).
Op's watch will last longer and have more value to them (not to mention monetary value). 
Some would also say that paying a btc price over 0.00 is also overpaying, but you put a value on possessing it. This is the same behaviour displayed here, and also with other objects.
To address your "conceited ..." comment - some of us value education. It's clear that you do not.
Additionally, self esteem has nothing to do with your original argument - stay on point.

The pacnw is gorgeous in summertime, but utter shit for 9 months.
I spent some time in Seattle and couldn't get back to nyc fast enough. Its just weird out there-very passive aggressive and lots of phoniness is what i observed.
Portland zoo was nice. Summertime was nice.
Fresh oysters and seafood.
That's it.

hard to argue that spending money on a nice watch qualifies here. same applies to shoes in my opinion. 
I've spent a lot of money on watches; i haven't ever regretted it.
