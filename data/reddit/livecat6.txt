I think there's a bit of confusion here between miners choosing which transactions they are going to try to build into the next block, and miners' nodes actually rejecting schnorr signature transactions that are in previously mined blocks from other miners that do choose to include schnorr signature transactions.
Is that right?

one thing to keep in mind is - what happens to the mining rigs in China? 
They'll either sell them, flooding the market with cheap mining hardware or,
they'll relocate them to their new mining operations. 
Another thing to consider is buying from another company than Bitmain but there's not a lot of choice right now....

you have to understand that if you're trying to spam the network and create congestion, using Segwit which relieves congestion would be counter to your goals and make your spamming less effective or more costly

The newest version of Electrum supports Bech32 Segwit (your address will start with 'bc1') but that address doesnt work with a lot of websites and other wallets. So what good is it? The answer: you're better off using a standard address on Electrum still.
They should provide P2SH support so you can have a Segwit address that starts with a '3' and is backwards compatible
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:56:15
that price is disgusting
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:47:32
yes it sounds more like is talking about this chart: 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:41:47
Yes, but here's the problem.
If I use Segwit with Electrum, then the usefulness of that wallet is severely limited:
Cant send to it from my Ledger Nano S
Can't send to it from my online exchanges
So Electrum is forcing me to decide between a Standard non-segwit address, and a version of Segwit that is currently not widely usable or backwards compatible! 
So what am I supposed to do! Either I go non-segwit, or I drop Electrum.
Ridiculous that they don't let you choose between Bech32 Segwit and P2WPKH-P2SH Segwit. 
What the hell was Electrum thinking?
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:54:52
its a step in the right direction. This is the first time that significantly larger blocks have been mined in all of Bitcoin's history

@_date: 2018-01-07 16:30:29
People unfortunately don't know how to fairly compare cryptos these days. Bitcoin processes a very large number of transactions per day, more than any other coin, and it's not enough. 
No other coins are seeing the widespread use/volume that Bitcoin is, and so any other coin's apparent advantages compared to bitcoin would not be there if it were as successful. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:56:34

@_date: 2018-01-03 21:24:00
Thanks so very much for this.
So if i understand correctly, you would only be able to send to a 'bc1' address from another 'bc1' addresss or a '3' address, but not from a standard '1' bitcoin address?
This is super frustrating. Why would electrum only offer the option of bc1 segwit or just standard, why not backwards compatible '3' segwit?

I dont have an answer but I wanted to say that this is a very good question. 
I wasted a good few hours monkeying around with Electrum while trying to get some friends started with BTC. I thought they were sending me something other than their addresses because the address started with bc1.
Stupid that Electrum didn't offer P2SH support; because who wants to use Bech32 right now? no one.

@_date: 2018-01-21 20:20:44
It also seems from this chart:   that the transaction volume isnt particularly lower so that further supports your point.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:14:01
I think the rate of transactions being created is more of a factor in the mempool clearing than Segwit at this point. Weekends tend to have less transaction activity than weekdays...
edit: a word
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:19:04
Besides the other comments here saying it's because they're crooks, which I agree with, there's also this viewpoint:
Bitcoin's rating was not because the mempool happened to be clogged at that time so much as it's because the Bitcoin mempool is susceptible to clogging again, and again. 
The obvious flaw however in the ratings system is that other "faster" coins have not yet encountered the amount of adoption that Bitcoin has, and many if not all other cryptos if successful, will have to solve the same problem that Bitcoin faces now. They ignore many factors that make Bitcoin the most robust crypto in existence. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:10:10
It's also potentially being considered a political weapon.
Think about the effect that widespread Bitcoin adoption would have on the US financial system, the Federal Reserve, the Banks. Now ask yourself, would Russia be in favor of that happening? Would other countries?
Nations could use the promotion of bitcoin to help weaken other nations who have superiority due to controlling the monetary system. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:06:24
It's true. We need full blown segwit adoption, schnorr and companies using good batching practices to remain efficient with blockspace - thereby leaving more room to chew through less efficient transactions and spam. 
If the network is efficient enough then the spammers won't be able to afford to do it for long. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:48:08
what do you think is the best way to make Bitcoin more accessible to people? I want to buy it an an ATM but the prices I've seen are a good 20% higher at least. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:25:18
Aren't fees charged not by weight, but by the portion of the transaction that is not segregated?  Put another way, I thought fees are only charged on the portion of the transaction that is in the 1mb block limit....
You can calculate an equivalent price/WU, which would be the equivalent price for that transaction if it was not Segwit, but i'm under the impression that you are bidding a regular fee that competes with all other transactions, but only for part of your transaction data. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:51:06
The reason to celebrate is because bigger blocks are an important step in scaling bitcoin - one of many steps. More important however, is lightening network and schnorr signatures - however these technologies as i understand it need to be built on top of segwit.
The thing to celebrate here, is that segwit allows a block size increase without a hard fork. The chances of successfully getting the entire network to agree on a hard fork are very low, so Segwit is a soft-fork block size increase, allowing bitcoin to scale without being divided. 
edit: a word
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:46:45
Actually no. I may have given the wrong impression / not totally understood the graphs myself either. 
The first graph is the percentage of transactions in the block that are Segwit. The number of Segwit transactions in the first graph didn't rise because there wasnt a significant increase in NUMBER of Segwit transactions, rather it was a few very LARGE Segwit transactions.
However, that that spike in the amount of segwit data getting processed (few large segwit transactions) can be seen in the 3rd and 4th graphs.
hope that helps!
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:06:18

I hear you.
I'm probably talking out my ass here but..
I feel that many of the alt/shitcoins are trying to do something different from BTC, or at least claiming that they do.
LTC is just trying to follow BTC as closely as possible.
Bitcoin was built on the shoulders of giants -all the advancements that had been made in cryptography were  culminated in Bitcoin. 
LTC following Bitcoin's footsteps makes it, in my opinion, potentially quite powerful and useful.
We shall see.

True but:
1) if you zoom out you can see there is currently an upward trend on transaction percentages.
2) transaction percentages are not all that matters! Have a look at graphs 3 and 4, both in the default view an in the "since activation" view. 
We have recently started seeing record size bitcoin blocks being minded in spurts. Some significantly bigger blocks are being mined lately which shows a trend towards using segwit and transaction batching for larger players who make a lot of transactions to a lot of addresses.
edit: in summary, I believe this trend will only continue. Smarter large players in the bitcoin realm will learn to be more efficient with blockspace even if it doesnt save them a ton of money now, it will protect them against losing a ton of money the next time fees rise.

@_date: 2018-01-21 19:25:20
if you're using this site:  
The graph is showing the 144 block moving average. You can see from scrolling down to the 3rd graph that indeed there were maybe 10-12 blocks that were much larger than normal.
Also the number of transactions in those blocks were quite low, but they were large transactions which would likely have had many inputs/outputs vs a simple single address transfer to another address. 
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:40:12
You're being silly if you think that it doesn't matter that Bitcoin is the most liquid crypto.

Compared to other massive financial markets, Bitcoin is not yet very liquid, which I think is your point.
@_date: 2019-07-11 15:50:08
I would counter argue that Litecoin, is trying to be *digital silver,* as it follows Bitcoin's development and actually implements BIPs often before Bitcoin implements it's own BIPs.
I could see Litecoin being a useful leading crypto, with the majority of market cap remaining on the Bitcoin blockchain.

 I thought that in order for that to happen, close to 100% of the transactions would have to be Segwit. With only 10% of transactions being Segwit currently, shouldnt the block sizes be 1 Mb, and the block weight be slightly higher than 1 Mb, say 1.3Mb?

So there you go and They would not be able to edit the payout and just re-broadcast it, as the hash of the block would have changed. They would have to keep mining until they found the correct nonce to discover a valid block

It's not about need so much as greed.
People who bought in at 19K are anxious to make the gainz they had hoped for and so are desperate for anything to pump the market.
That being said however, institutional money WILL flow into BTC, sooner or later whether you like it or not and it will inflate the price, but it's not needed in any way to 'save' bitcoin, it just is what it is.

@_date: 2017-12-06 19:05:17
Firstly, core developers weren't even invited to the NYA.
Secondly, the implementation of segwit allows for blocks up to 4mb that appear to be 1mb blocks to older nodes - the point of this was to make the upgrade a soft fork that wouldn't alienate older nodes that didnt have the upgraded software. Whenever possible, the core team is trying to avoid hard forks. They care about the long term health of the protocol
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:28:39
The idea is that conventional investments are controlled by various government organizations that can change policy, sieze control of a company, its assets, or your assets, and that Bitcoin is impervious to this.
Then the point was made that government policy on bitcoin, on a global scale can cause price fluctuations in bitcoin, ie china bans bitcoin, japan embraces bitcoin etc.
However the statement is tongue in cheek as it causes the price to move but doesnt actually change the fact that governments can control bitcoin.

If the whole arguement is based off the premise that bitcoin's 'small blocks' is the reason that ethereum formed and coin dilution happened, I'm not sure I agree with that. 
If bigger blocks happened there would be factions that wanted small blocks. 
In the end, if you really dive into the block size debate you'll find that bigger blocks don't do much when scaling approaches even a national level let alone global. Layer 2 solutions are what is needed and smaller blocks actually push that development forward faster.

The price roughly doubled over a couple days before the halvening happened, then, post-halvening, it fell back down to about the level it was at before. 
Then it slowly built, and went on an insane bull run as supply and demand balanced out.

You're right about 'one day' but for the foreseeable future I think is correct. 
Plenty of people are mining bitcoins at a loss nowadays because they are hodlers and are hoping to either hodl long term or sell as soon as they can for a profit. 
Any company or individual that believes in the long term success of bitcoin can mine at a loss, the same way they can tie their money up by buying BTC to wait for a future ROI.

Technology adoption curve; we are now past the peak of inflated expectations:

Bitcoin transaction fees now lowest since 2011
With its growing popularity, Bitcoin has seen slow transaction times and high fees, reducing the ease of use of the part (BTC) and widespread adoption.
However, transaction fees have been at their lowest since 2011 thanks to SegWit (Segregated ** Wi ** tness) as well as increased use of the Lightning network.

I keep having to explain this to people who make the same argument that you're making.
If miners turn off their mining equipment the hashrate drops, and the amount of hashing power required to do a 51% attack is greatly reduced.
If hashing power falls enough, then a 51% attack becomes more and more feasible.

Yes it would help the price, but you would never get any sort of community consensus, so the implementation of that idea is all but impossible.
If we're talking about magically uniting people from around the world for a common goal, there's a lot of things that you could fix, for example poverty, corruption, greed, child labor, slavery.
Also, if you're talking about magically uniting all bitcoiners, just telling everyone not to sell should bring the price up to infinity, since no-one who wants to buy bitcoin, no matter the price , would be able to get any.
Unless you consider the miners seperately - bitcoin miners have to pay for their electricity costs, and are therefore compelled to sell the BTC they mine to cover their hardware and electricity costs.
This is where the block reward and halving come in. etc etc.

@_date: 2019-11-28 18:43:21
I would argue that people invest in foreign currencies all the time as a way of diversifying their portfolio, so one could argue that this is no different.
The problem you're describing, in my opinion isn't actually a problem, and here's why:
If you're holding bitcoin as an investment, and the price appreciates substantially, then in order for you to realize your profit, you either sell some BTC, or you make a purchase with it, which is also a form of selling BTC but you're selling it for exchange of goods.
Your argument sounds similar to the argument that people make about why deflationary currencies/economies "won't work" but in reality, if I'm hungry and I need food, and all I have is BTC - you can bet that i'm going to be selling some BTC for food, or rent, or a car which I need to get to work, or clothes that I need to wear to be a member of society, etc etc.
Perhaps *frivolous* spending would be reduced in a deflationary economy/currency, but people still need to spend their money for basics.
You're not going to have every bitcoin hodler just sitting there and not selling as the price passes 50k, 100k, 500k etc, some will sell, and the laws of supply and demand will continue to function.  
\~edit\~ one more thing, with bitcoin, there's no "shouldnt".  
Any "shouldn't" arguement that you can make, bitcoin needs to be able to solve, merely by it's code. Bitcoin cannot rely on any external interventions to make it the hardest form of money that has ever existed, it just has to be.  
"People shouldn't hoard bitcoin" - sure but if they do, they're taking on risk -maybe the'll be rewarded, maybe they'll get rekt  
"People shouldn't manipulate the price of Bitcoin" - sure, but if they do, they might get rekt  
"People shouldn't use bitcoin for small purchases, when LN would work just fine" (imagining a more stable implementation of LN in the future) - sure, but if they do so, they'll pay higher transaction fees for using on-chain transactions  
"People shouldn't manipulate bitcoin transaction fees by spamming the network" - sure, but if they do, they're going to pay a lot of money in transaction fees, and make the network more robust and resilient in the future.
etc. etc. etc

Sorry buddy, but yes people absolutely do invest in foreign currencies, so you're just plain wrong.
Also, you seem to not know the difference between investing and trading, as you use the two terms interchangeably. I'm not talking about trading.   


I wonder why you're even here on if you feel so strongly that a deflationary currency is so bad.  
 It's one of the main tenets of Bitcoin.   
You can keep spouting your Keynesian economics nonsense till you're blue in the face but it doesn't change the fact that every goddamned inflationary currency in history has eventually failed, there is no known solution to it, and bitcoin is the hardest most sound money in all of history.  


Dismantling the fractional reserve banking system will cause interest rates to rise which will allow people to actually earn money from their savings instead of the paltry rates that you get nowadays, which are less than the rate of inflation.   
Anyways, there's no convincing you. Again, not sure why you're here on since you're such a defender of the way the banking systems have run for well over a century.

What are your thoughts on the idea of the block subsidy eventually decreasing to very low levels and potentially causing hashrate to drop low enough to make a 51% attack much easier to accomplish (wont be a problem for a long time but still)?

Edit: punctuation
@_date: 2019-03-25 14:49:48
I agree. 
On one hand, we need to keep the blocksize as is to keep the blockchain size down and to incentivize other scalability developments such as Schnorr, Segwit etc, but on the other hand as time goes on and more and more nodes come online, it will be harder and harder to reach enough consensus for a hard fork that is accepted by the majority of the bitcoin community.

transaction fees in the long run will absolutely not go down  
the solution to this will be LN (Lightning Network) and other L2 (Layer 2) solutions  
in the future there will always be someone willing to pay more for their transaction  
my guess is that on-chain transaction fees will be at anywhere between $20-$100+ dollars within the next few years, and eventually will never go below those numbers.

It's great to look at the market this way, and run the math.  
We currently have 1800 BTC being created per day x $10,000 USD = 18 million USD is required to enter the market each day in order to maintain the price at the current level. 
If the same inflow occurs, and only 900 BTC are created per day the price should double to $20,000 USD
at the next halving in 4.5 years, $40,000 USD / btc
At the next halving in 8.5 years, $80,000 USD
at the next halving in 12.5 years, $160,000 USD
and at the next in 16.5 years, $320,000 USD
this of course assumes that there is no increase or decrease in the amount of capital flowing into BTC.

@_date: 2019-11-29 17:24:38
Ok I agree with you that spending large sums of money on transaction fees for relatively small transactions doesnt make sense, but:
I don't agree that large fees requires the value of 1 BTC to be high, rather, large transaction fees require that the transaction values themselves need to be high, not the value of one btc.
Whether 1 BTC = 10k or 500k, transferring $100k worth of btc for $50 bucks is a relatively small percentage transaction fee. Doesnt have anything to do with the price of BTC.  
The more important point, as I mentioned in my comment a few levels up, is LN and other layer 2 solutions ares the solution to small value transactions in BTC.

@_date: 2019-11-28 22:45:52
No I agree. Most people will go custodial in the long run.
Regarding fees, why do you equate the value of the coin to higher transaction fees?
I've seen this comparison before and I think it's kind of..... Not well thought out. 
If bitcoin is worth a million bucks, people aren't going to suddenly be ok with super expensive transactions because some folks have a million bucks in btc. As bitcoin's value increases the cost per v/byte per transaction will actually drop below the current minimum of 1 satoshi per byte to stay with what we currently define the acceptable value of a transaction to be. 
In other words, when I say the price per transaction in the future will be 20-100$ I mean that number as a representation of value. Hence if btcs future price is high, I still expect fees to be in that range in current, today's fiat value. 
As a side note regarding fees, if you take the current amount of income generated for miners based on the block reward, and the current price, you get $18 million US per day in reward. 
If you assume that this much daily income is required to secure the network, and divide that number by the total number of transactions that can occur in a full, fully segwit block, and we assume that we're far in the future where there is almost no block reward, you would need about $90  fee per transaction  to create enough incentive for miners to mine.

yah but the idea that "Millennials will be the richest generation in history" is, in my opinion, complete BS considering most Millennials don't have and *wont have* Bitcoin before the next bull run.  
When I tell people about Bitcoin, they say "oh I thought that was over"  
If you go on explaining it more, they just get this smile on their face like "oh isnt that cute, you're passionate about something". They don't check the price, the history, the underlying technology, or anything.   
When those people come to you and start asking about buying Bitcoin, that is when we're about to moon, because they only thing people care about, is making a buck.

Yes, there will be direct onboarding to LN, rather than having to go through layer 1 and then open a channel.
  
You will get a lightning wallet and buy bitcoin directly through lightning, and will not have to pay $100 to open a channel.

Institutional investors will be competing with each other if they try to manipulate BTC.  
Actor 1 may try to cause a price drop by selling, but if Actor 2 then buys their dip, then Actor 1 has just liquidated a lot of their bitcoin but not caused a significant price drop.   
Now they either have to wait for the price to drop further to buy back in, or they wait/risk having to buy in at a higher price (loss).
  
These actors will eventually get rekt. Once the maket cap balloons into the trillions, and more and more BTC onramps are built, it will be harder and harder to cause significant price spikes and troughs from manipulation.

@_date: 2018-06-19 15:18:02
but what does it mean, Basil?
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:05:20
dumb article title.
How would you use bitcoin without blockchain, unless the sale was taking place on LN which i'm sure it's not.
@_date: 2019-10-08 14:24:10
it's actually a good question. If the answer is easy please link it.  
I believe the math works out to the following:
If only transaction fees existed, then the average transaction fee would need to be $30-40 to sustain the current level of bitcoin mining. Not sure if that takes into account full segwit usage or not.
Conceivably, if the blocksize was doubled, this would bring the average transaction cost down to $15-20.
With widespread use of signature aggregation, but not a block size increase, the cost could be $25-30 per transaction.
Many argue that this will break Bitcoin, but others claim that:
1) that is still cheaper than a bank wire transfer, and much faster, cannot be cancelled etc
2) that is a price that many will be willing to pay for moving large sums of money
3) much of the future usage of BTC will be on L2 such as lightning, and so having to pay that fee to onboard to lightning would be worth it if you did larger top-ups, on a say, monthly or bi-monthly or longer basis. Of course, the idea is that eventually you could onboard straight to lightning without having to go through base layer first.
Anyways, I haven't provided any sources but that's the gist of it.

Ah. Maybe that's what you meant to ask, but what you actually asked was:  


I guess what you meant was something like:  
"Can anyone speak more about the exernal factors that influenced bitcoin price leading up to the halvening? Was there FUD? Did the community generally feel that the halving was priced in ahead of time, only to find afterwards that it was not?" etc etc.  
Anyways, good that you're trying to learn.
One thing that stuck out for me was the price performance at the second halvening. There was a big jump from buy orders, and then a big selloff. Probably lots of folks 'got rekt' by it, and maybe sold at that point, only to miss out on the actual bull run that accumulated afterwards.
I know this isn't what you asked but, if you're trying to time the market, don't try. Just DCA for the win.

if you're more interested in accuracy, bitcoin would transfer to a lightning node which would be slow and be subject to the 10 minute block time. That lightning node then would be able to send through other nodes exactly as you visualized it.  
You could also visualize it as a lightning node that's bound to a floating Bitcoin ball which is able to be fired like a lightning gun by the bitcoin ball, but it visualizes that it's through a lightning node.

You're going to need to make sure you have a good crypto on-ramp set up at the bar so you can serve people who don't have crypto, but who are willing to buy it right there.
A bitcoin ATM would be a good idea, but lightning would be better.   
I'm not sure if you're legally allowed to or not, but if you could sell people small amounts of crypto on lightning, that would probably make the most sense from a usability, low fees standpoint.

How is this insightful at all?
Price of bitcoin drives profitability of mining, profitability of mining impacts hashrate, hashrate changes impact blocktime
This graph merely shows that when the price goes up, more hashing power comes online and the block time temporarily decreases until the next difficulty adjustment.   
Same thing happens the other way around - price crashes, hash rate drops, block time increases, until the next difficulty adjustment.
This is widely known and understood already.

I agree with your points.
In a deflationary economy, I still need to buy food, I still need a car, I still need my apartment, I still want to take a vacation every now and then. I still want to go out and have a beer with friends. I still want to enjoy my life.
  
What I may be less inclined to do however, is to put my money in risky investments to try to have to keep up with inflation. These investments could be anything from a savings account, stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals etc.  When you do that with your money, now you're susceptible to bad actors via market manipulation, stock fraud, issues with fake precious metals etc.   
The inflationary economy causes people to always tend to have to *expose* their money to outside risk factors. 
The whole world economy is a scam, there isn't enough money in the world to pay back all the debt in the world.

What is bidding up vs bidding down in this context?
@_date: 2019-10-08 18:31:20
No, I don't think price matters much here.
We're assuming a block reward of 0, which is what will happen in 2140, at which point only transaction fees will act as incentive for the miners.
My assumptions were in todays relative dollar values, and I also assume that blocks in 2140 will always be full.
Edit: I may as well do the math.
Current daily mining revenue is 12.5 btc per block x 144 blocks per day x 8200 US/BTC at the time of this writing
= $14,600,000(US) in daily BTC that is generated, which would have to be covered solely by transaction fees in the future.
So, if we assume a block can hold 3500 transactions (guessing here based off recent full blocks, so not fully segwit)
That's 3500x144= 504,000 transactions possible per day.
$14,600,000/504,000= $28 dollars per transaction required to pay miners the same daily amount at today's hashrate, but using fees only with no block reward.
~~So my original estimates were too high.~~
Edit: I used 6.25 block reward originally which is incorrect, changed numbers in calculations to current block reward which is 12.5
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:25:40
by that logic then every halvening for forever should be priced into it now. 
And since eventually there will be no new supply of bitcoins, i guess that means that every single person on earth should be running out trying to buy bitcoin as fast as possible while the price is still low, but they don't.
Because not everyone feels confident enough to buy now. The halvnening isn't the only factor that determines price, and its been shown time and time again that Bitcoin is  too unpredictable to guess what the price will be in the future.

Good post, and good message.
The exchanges know about segwit, some have been proactive, some have been lazy or intentionally malicious by not upgrading.
In time those who don't adopt it will pay much more in fees as transaction costs go up when blocks are full.
The free market will drive the adoption of segwit, and so will lightning, since lightning requires segwit.
The problem of segwit adoption, and scalability, won't be solved until it becomes more of a problem.

You're both in agreement.  
Now, my beef with their post is that it assumes that an average user knows all the incredble details and nuances to Bitcoin that makes it great, and would be able to successfully convey that to one or more cryptographers to implement a pre Bitcoin version of Bitcoin.  No, just no. 
Hiring programmers is a nightmare, and the capital required to pay them would be much better spent on mining and purchasing hundreds of thousands of bitcoins after Satoshi created it, without all the headache and time spent trying to emulate something so beautiful and well thought-out.

Past downward difficulty adjustments happen because the price crashes and miners turn off their rigs because they're losing money.  
Long bull runs have historically occurred *eventually* after big price crashes.

Your argument is that there is a false dilemma:  [

In reality, members of the community who want to test, support, experience, and be a part of this exciting and emergent technology would not be foolish to lock up $5, $10, heck even $1 worth of BTC into lightning to try it out.
Your argument makes no distinction between the two extremes.
You also make the false assumption in the post above that putting money into LN guarantees it to be lost, when in reality, there is simply a risk of it being lost, and that depends largely on your own competence as a user.

No, stake in bitcoin has no effect on the price.
Bitcoin is 100% proof of work.
The price swings happen because people anticipate the having, and buy which causes a temporary price spike.
The spike does not meet expectations and so the market  reacts as if the anticipated bull run from the halvening 'failed' and a sell-off occurs.
Eventually the effects of the cut in the supply demand equation catch up with the market and the price builds.
You need to remeber that for the price of bitcoin to just stay the same, all the new bitcoin that is mined need to be consumed by the market.
When that supply is cut in half, it takes time for the effects to be felt.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:51:16
That sucks dude. Definitely buy some now, except this time, don't sell it no matter what.
To be frank, no matter what comes up in life, if you've decided you won't sell that bitcoin then you won't sell it.
You viewed that money as being usable, spend able, and when shit hit the fan you used it. Understandable.
 But if you didn't have that bitcoin in the first place, you would have found a way to deal with that expense. I'm not saying it would have been easy, but you probably would have come up with something.

if by less useful, you mean that onboarding to LN through layer 1 will be *more expensive* then sure, but that doesnt make LN less useful.
  
The future will be direct onboarding to LN without having to go through base blockchain layer, so there's no issue there.
onchain transactions *should*  be limited as much as possible but limited how, by whom? It will self limit due to cost of transactions.
Also I disagree that blocksize should be lowered but I get the underlying concept that you're trying to highlight.
In reality, I believe the blocksize one day will need to be raised, as the endgame for BTC will be very low block rewards, and transaction fees alone will not be enough of an incentive to miners unless those fees are super high, or the blocksize is increased.   
Also in reality, the blocksize may never increase, as the longer bitcoin exists the less potential there will be to reach community wide consensus. It already looks next to impossible

Also not a dev, but Andreas spoke about this in one of his recent Q&amp;A releases, i'll come back with an edit to add it.
Basically, Schnorr is going to be implemented along with a few other important technologies via a softfork.The idea is that by loading so many powerful new features into one softfork, miners and nodes will be more compelled to make the switch, rather than a slow trickle.
Also I think some of the new techs being proposed work with each other in a very synergistic way, and so they should all be released at once.

Because layer 2 solutions like lightning network will have very low transaction fees and are secured by the bitcoin network.
Also if you're looking to send money abroad or with wire transfers, you'll easily pay more than that to make a transaction that may take days if not weeks to go through, vs within an hour or less with BTC.
There are many use cases where it makes sense to pay 10-20 bucks for a transaction on-chain, and many many more use cases using layer 2 solutions.

Your thought process would make sense if Bitcoin were a manufactured product produced by one company. The company would calculate it's cost to produce the product, and then add a markup on top of that for profit.
Bitcoin doesn't work that way. It is produced by thousands of different entities, all with different costs, motivations, and economic conditions.   
Furthermore, most of the world's bitcoin is already mined, and entities who hold BTC can decide to sell at any time for a variety of reasons.
Bitcoin is bought and sold in online exchanges, and the price is determined by a combination of what buyers are willing to pay for it and what sellers are willing to sell it for.  
The bottom line, is that when the halving happens, nothing will immediately change. Miners would **like** to be able to sell their post-halving bitcoin for double, but since others will likely be selling at the same price as before, miners will have to sell their bitcoin at that market rate.  
Historically, slowly over time, the lack of supply causes these cheaper coins to be sold off and the price slowly rises due to supply shortages, but that takes time to happen.

Someone wanna summarize?
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:25:47
Sorry, that's incorrect.   
Increasing hashing power does not do anything to increase the rate of new blocks being mined. There is a slight increase in speed if hashrate shoots up quickly, but the difficulty always adjusts so that one bock is discovered on average every 10 minutes.
One computer mining bitcoin, or a hundred million ASICs, there will be a block every 10 minutes.  
Bitcoin, at some point in the future, will likely always have high transaction fees. The way around this is to use LN (Lightning) which is a cash system built on top of bitcoin.   
LN has the capacity to handle millions of transactions per second, for very low, sometimes free, fees.   
Bitcoin is the hardest form of money ever created in history, so it's always going to cost you to transact on the base layer.

@_date: 2019-12-02 13:47:43
The way you ask your question is a bit unsettling. 
What will the price do? Nobody knows. 
Why don't you look at the price history after the last two halvening and see what you think about that.
There is no "cost to mine bitcoin" it depends on many factors, but mostly price of electricity, price of your mining hardware, and price to house your mining equipment.
Different miners have different costs.
When the block reward is cut in half, then a miner's cost to produce a bitcoin will double. That doesn't mean that the price they sell it at will double.

First you were trying to ask if the halving dictates that the price doubles, and now, rather than respond to any of my points, you're just saying that a deflationary currency means the price will go up over time. Yes, a deflationary currency goes up in value over time. Currently bitcoin is an **inflationary** currency due to the block reward. You could calculate bitcoin's current rate of inflation yourself if you weren't so lazy.

I like your ideas.   
I envision that as there is growing incentive to avoid the layer one blockchain due to fees, users may continually push to keep their lightning payments moving and the whole crypto economy could run on layer 2.   
Imagine that instead of being paid every two weeks, you get paid every day in lightning. Now imagine that instead of paying your mortgage or your bills or whatever every month, you instead opt to pay them in realtime through lighning.   
So you get paid every day, and then you go into your bill payment app and you bring all your hydro, internet, mortgage accounts up to date for the day.  
Same for businesses. Businesses could make smaller more frequent payments to their suppliers, employees, etc to keep the lightning payments flowing.   
This way you don't hold on to more lightning than you need to, and it provides more liquidity to the lightning market.   
Thoughts?

Meh, whatever. They'll re-enable it / enable lightning payments when its makes sense to do so, which isnt now. Once the next bull run kicks in, the mempool will be just as clogged as it was last time.
Valve adopting or not adopting BTC payments is not going to speed up any scaling solutions IMHO
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:35:37
Let me help you.
A fork of Bitcoin was created by people who attempted to brand it as the "true" Bitcoin by the fork's advocates, and the main reason they were advocating for this was because they felt Bitcoin could not scale due to the block size limit, and their proposed improvement was a block size increase.
Bitcoin is showing more and more that it is able to fill larger blocks as Segwit adoption increases, thereby removing the main argument touted by the proponents of the fork. 
I'm all for the concept that there's room for more than one crypto, but i'm not ok with BCash shills trying to FUD Bitcoin for their own benefit. 
Now do you understand? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:14:33
nice concept but vid quality could use a boost! Keep it up!
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:29:57
whats the point you're trying to make? that Segwit adoption hasn't changed significantly? 
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:51:53


are you serious? The answer is: so that real people can actually use their software to receive bitcoins, thats why.
If I prefer Electrum, which I do, and I want to use Segwit, which I do, then I can't use Electrum with exchanges and most other recipients at this time with Segwit. That means I either have to go to another provider or I have to do some crazy work around that I know exists but i'm not prepared to do.

I think the statement "crypto needs rules" can be interpreted many different ways, and some of those interpretations are virtuous and some of them are not.
Should crypto exchanges and custodial services be required to follow some rules? to:
\-ensure that they are not lying about their reserves
\-ensure their security is tight
\-ensure their reserves are insured/guaranteed?
yes, I think they should, as this provides a lot of value to potential customers
Should KYC laws be allowed to run amok and should government be allowed to collect mass surveilance data on people using crypto and be able to ban businesses and entities from using crypto? well no I don't think so.
It's more than a black and white thing.

Because the market will always take the easiest solution, not necessarily the one that is best in the long run.
Take segwit adoption for example, we're still only at 50% segwit adoption even though it saves you transaction fees. People were incentivised to adopt segwit because of the block size limit being one megabyte and they will continue to be incentivised to increase efficient use of the blockchain because of this limit.

Regarding lightning network - Elizabeth Stark had said that for nodes to use the latest beta release, they would have to close their channels. 
The current state of lightning mainnet makes me think that most of the nodes are still running the pre-beta release and have not upgraded, since we haven't seen a lot of channels closing. Can someone confirm this?
Upon checking the latest, the node count is down to 833 from 1006, so perhaps many nodes are upgrading. Is there any way to see how many are running the updated version?
@_date: 2019-01-07 16:36:55
Ok, what you linked me to does nothing to further your argument and is just showing another place where you are making the same incorrect assumptions.
I'll try to break it down for you. I may get some of the exact terminology wrong but here goes. Experts please feel free to correct anything that may be off.
Running a bitcoin node means you are running the **Bitcoin node software** \- for lack of a better name. Maybe it's called bitcoin core node software - i'm not sure. This software contains all of the current rules of bitcoin.
Then, there is the **blockchain itself** which is now about 250 gigs of data and counting.
You're incorrectly assuming that a person could be provided with a blockchain that potentially has been modified or compromised in some way, and that the bitcoin node software would just happily run using that compromised blockchain. That's not how it works.
Your bitcoin software (which, you must ensure is itself, valid) will validate the entire blockchain you download from the genesis block to the latest block. If any single thing in that entire blockchain is invalid, your bitcoin node software will determine this and not allow you to use the blockchain. You're not having to trust that the blockchain is valid, you validate it yourself.
This also leads me to believe that you don't understand how the blockchain works, with each block containing the hash of the previous block. Any change to any part of the bitcoin blockchain would require that every block after the modified block be re-mined. As we know, mining takes an immense amount of computing power, and it would be completely infeasible to have to re-mine every block on your own machine.
This might help. There's lots to learn about this complicated and beautiful technology. [
Bottom line: there's nothing wrong with having a pre-loaded blockchain as long as your actual bitcoin validation software is ensured to be legitimate.

Back doesn't control bitcoin but I would be curious to know what the main devs think about potential future block size increases. I think 8 Mb is too much due to bandwidth and storage requirements which 8mb blocks would greatly increase. 
Layer 2 solutions like lightning are absoluley necessary to scale the network.
My guess is we won't see a blocksize increase for a long time if ever, and when it is increased it won't be much more than 2-4mb
@_date: 2019-01-14 14:23:40
no, it's not time
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:24:33
That hardly means that the scaling debate is a thing of the past. 
It just means that the network isnt being spammed anymore/the hype cycle peak has passed.If Bitcoin continues to grow in popularity, it will grapple with scaling issues until we have 2nd layer solutions, as well as other on-chain solutions like Segwit, Schnorr, and eventually block size increases.

mm. don't beat yourself up man. It was a penny stock basically back then; you couldn't have known it would do that. 
You balanced out being greedy with being humble and taking a 100% profit which is unheard of in most stocks.
Also if you invested $500 and the price went from 5 to 10, that's the same as if you invested $500 later and the price went from 250 to 500, or from 1000 to 2000, or 2000 to 4000
Many people will invest now, and pull out when they make 50%, 100%, 200% profit.

I don't think that's the question to ask. 
I think the question to ask is: are there many/any countries where the cost of a typical product is less than 1¢? 
Typically in countries where one fiat unit is worth much less than 1¢, you need to use many of those fiat units to buy anything, meaning that you do not require such a small division of currency.

@_date: 2018-07-31 01:59:21
I'm sorry but I think this article is plain wrong. Perhaps i'm wrong and if so, i'd appreciate a correction but:
The reward halving, does not really affect the hashrate. Hypothetcially, assuming supply is cut in half and demand remains the same when a halvening occurs, the crypto asset should double in value, thereby being just as profitable despite half the reward being produced.
In reality, as price increases, some hodlers sell, therefore the price does not immediately double, but should over time trend upwards to double and beyond. 
Perhaps the article is suggesting that when the BCH halvening occurs first, hashrate will move from BCH to BTC due to btc being more profitable, thereby making a smaller amount of BTC hashrate necessary to 51% attack the BCH network, but absolutely none of that is explained in the article.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:34:58
Good points. One question though, I was under the impression that you could have up to 4mb block weight if 100% Segwit was adopted. Not true?
Also, my understanding (no source sorry) was that there was a lot of "Segwit adoption has failed" comments from the Bcash crowd, as opposed to criticizing the size increase that it does provide, but again I dont have any particular sources to show you on that hearsay. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:11:29

@_date: 2019-09-05 00:49:07
That quote made me actually read the article to verify. 
If the article is correct, Square is investing about $1.8 million US per day in Bitcoin.  
200% daily is **$360 million** **per day** in today's US dollars 
so that assumes that the price doesnt change ,or that when the halvening occurs the price per BTC doubles,  
so now I find this hard to believe

I'll try, but I'm going to need some help from others who are more knowledgeable. I know enough to know that most of your points are not very good, but the technical details are a bit sketchy to me. 
 I'd have to write an article as long as yours to thoroughly counter your arguments but here we go:  






...It's true that Bitmain produces the majority of miners, however many other companies are entering the market and starting to compete with Bitmain.  
Regarding backdoors, there are several organizations that are writing aftermarket firmware that you can flash onto your Bitmain antminer so that you're not using their firmware:  [   


They don't really control the hashpower. these pools are made up of individual miners who can leave the pool if they want. These pools are in competition with each other and power checks power. 


This is a really confusing statement - it sounds like you're talking about bitcoin mining hardware, which is completely un-true, there's so much bitcoin mining hardware that the only way you could fit it in a room is if that room was a football stadium. Totally implausable.
It sounds however like you're talking about people who control the mining pools, and you reference the Hong Kong agreement, except that in realty, what did that do? There was no hard fork, as was planned. Rather, the UASF (user activated soft fork) occurred and activated Segwit.
 [ 


I can't argue with that too much, but it seems as though it would be difficult for all the nations to launch a concerted ban on bitcoin mining. All you need is a VPN and then they can't tell you're mining bitcoin. Do you think that the USA, or Canada, or European nations etc would be able to ban bitcoin mining somehow? I'd like to see them try  


 The only way to attack the chain would be to have more than 51% of the hashing power which is difficult, but then you'd have to perform a large enough double-spend attack to make this huge effort profitable. Furthermore, if a double spend was carried out, the value of bitcoin would drop substantially, so any actors that had enough hash power to perform this attack would almost immediately ruin the entire ecomomy that they currently profit off of. They would be shooting themselves in the foot.  


Completely untrue. The security budget of bitcoin = block reward x value of bitcoin. The block reward halves every 4 years, and historically, the price adjusts to compensate after that halving, raising the value, and restoring the security budget before increasing significantly. Essentially, the security budget of bitcoin is the hashrate, plain and simple. This graph does not show the security budget halving every 4 years, it shows it growing rapidly:  [ 
further down:


 C) Take some of Satoshi’s coins and use them to fund inflation. Could see this happening. 
Sorry, could you explain how you see this happening? It's not going to happen.  


 **4- Lack of privacy** 
I'll give you that one, except lightning helps solve that in L2
Centralized development - fair point. I don't know the true state of the developers or how they work together  
Quantum computers - are nowhere near where the would need to be to be a threat to Bitcoin. When they are, we will cross that bridge.  
It can't scale to mainstream - yes, it can with L2. And before you say that no-one will be able to afford the on-chain transaction required to get lightning, there will eventually be lightning on-ramps that allow newb's to purchase lightning directly with fiat without the intermediate step of doing an on-chain transaction.  
Anyways, that's my first crack at a rebuttal. Could use some help from others more knowledgeable than myself.

@_date: 2018-07-12 03:12:49
You're right, but I personally don't believe the time for that is now. 
Right now, the minimum fee to spam the network (or to make a 'legitimate' transaction), is 1 satoshi per byte. 
Although network spam has, does and will continue to happen, this minimum cost is an economic disincentive to spam the network.
What I'm getting at is, when Bitcoin is worth more, that will be the time to potentially lower the threshold.  
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:46:46
is correct  
For every transaction that is faster than 10 minutes, on average you will have an equal number of transactions that take longer than 10 minutes.  
Someone has a transaction go through in 2 minutes, someone else has to wait 40 minutes. It happens.   
We should instead, be talking about layer 2 solutions that will allow Bitcoin to function more like instant electronic cash. Even 4 minutes is too slow. We need instant transactions just like credit card and debit.   
That is coming with L2 solutions, and will never be the case on the base Bitcoin blockchain, which is okay in my opinion.

On the other hand, people may be more incentivized to save money, *and may spend less money on* *things they don't need*. I don't think that's a bad thing.

I was just using reddit as an example.
Many sites have more intrusive pop up ads or require you to sign up or have a membership because they need to pay for their writers, hosting etc.
Point is that lightning could allow seamless pay to use web browsing that could bypass having to use advertisers as well as bypass having to sign up.

hello redditor for one week. 
A couple things:

2) Impossible is a very strong word
3) volatility would decrease if the price and adoption increases. Is volatility the only reason you think it wouldn't work? 
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:26:54
It's not 12m of volume, it's 12m worth of BTC being created each and every day. If the price stays the same, that means that the market is absorbing those 1800 btc per day at 7000 USD = 12m US worth of money entering the market every single day. 
Trading bitcoin and having it move around and change hands does nothing to stop the inflow of those 1800 new bitcoins every day.

@_date: 2019-09-28 02:48:53
Ah thanks very much for that explanation.
So if I understand correctly, miners are not broadcasting any info about their hash rate to anywhere, rather the hash rate is 'guessed' by looking at how long on average its taking to mine a block, along with the current difficulty which is known.

Lol and suddenly bcash comes into the picture.
Higher transaction fees will incentivize segwit, but segwit will still be much more e pensive than Lightning Network, and so the majority of users of bitcoin for day to day transactions will migrate to Lightning.
And yes I think that users will also take up a small number of alt coins as well, with Bitcoin remaining as the "gold standard". 
@_date: 2019-09-05 14:26:18
is looking at it wrong.  
If you pay to have 10,000 ads served and 1 is clicked, and the cost per click is say $1.00, then the cost to serve an ad is $1/10,000
So if I want to view your website, and I don't want to see ads, then I would pay for $1/10,000 of an ad
now the probability of an ad being clicked goes down to 1/9,999 but i've paid for my 1/10,000 of the revenue needed to pay for the site. I'm essentially paying the same market rate to not see ads.
I can't explain it properly. I hope you understand

I think this sub is rather defensive of raising this issue, and rightfully so. The scale of misinformation being spread by bad actors is pretty mind boggling.
That being said, OP has very tastefully raised an issue and is looking for discussion, and we should be respectful back. Here is my opinion:
A block size increase will not allow bitcoin to scale up to any kind of widespread use, unless you increased the blocksize by several orders of magnitude. We could sit around and argue that a 2MB block doesnt cause very much loss of decentralization, but 2MB blocks won't solve the problem. 
20 mb blocks won't solve the problem.
maybe 200 mb blocks would solve the problem, but that creates so many more problems in the end. 
Even with 100% segwit, schnorr, batching, etc, and 20 MB blocks, bitcoin would still not be able to handle the scale of transactions required for widespread adoption.
Therefore, layer 2 (L2) solutions are required. Lightning looks promising. We should continue to develop, test and implement it. L1 will be the strong backbone. L2 will process the majority of transactions in the future.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:30:49
I think you're the one who needs to think about it. 
@_date: 2019-09-04 21:20:09
Block time and transaction fees have nothing to do with each other.   
I'm stating that the block time will forever be 10 minutes on average.  
You're making it sound as if transaction fees are somehow interrelated with block time, which they're not, so either you don't know what you're talking about, or you're being intentionally or unintentionally vague/ambiguous, and that's not good for any newbs reading the thread  
In the end, transaction fees will be high to transact on the base layer. 
That's easy to predict right now.
For cheap transactions, use lightning network  
For transactions on the blockhain that are ultra secure, you can pay the market transaction fee rate.
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:30:48
Ok I'm done being a dick.
But my point is this: Blacksmiths used to be ubiquitous, as everyone had horses and needed them shoed. 
Banks right now are ubiquitous in any developed nation. Maybe one day they won't be, if enough people become their own bank. 
Of course they will never go away, like the above poster said, but they may control a far smaller chunk of finance in the future, just like the blacksmith industry still exists for horses but to a much smaller degree. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:46:27
You don't know where the bottom is. It's not obvious.
They best way to approach it is to buy regularly so that you dollar cost average.

I just got back from Mexico where I used my credit card twice. Got a call from my bank regarding potential fraud and I then found about $3000 in random charges on my card. Thanks Mexico. 
Credit cards are not very secure. Sure your card company will reverse the charges but who wants to deal with that, or bother converting currency, carrying multiple types of cash etc.

@_date: 2018-04-12 14:37:56
Someone had an interesting post about this awhile ago. 
They reasoned that when the price is declining, miners need to sell more coins to cover their electricity cost, thereby driving the price further down. 
When price is rising, they can horde more of their coins, thereby reducing liquidity and driving the price up further. 
Positive feedback loops in both directions.

@_date: 2018-04-27 13:00:34

@_date: 2018-04-25 22:35:03
It will get there. 
More use will cause higher fees which will drive up the demand for Segwit by bitcoin-related companies as they strive to remain competitive. 
Lightning Network is an extension of this phenomenon, as users want to pay the lowest fees possible, and Lightning Network requires segwit to work. 
In time, users wishing to use BTC as cash will use Lightning Network to have the lowest possible fees, and those wishing to transact directly on the blockchain will do so for a higher fee. Users have the choice to pay more for non-segwit transactions on-chain, or to pay less by using Segwit transactions on-chain, edit: (or to pay the least by using Lightning Network).

@_date: 2019-05-22 03:15:27
The value in proof of work of btc is in the computational work required to mine it. 
It's not just about time, it's about millions and millions of dollars in electrical consumption and mining hardware and the fact that as the network grows a 51% attack costs more and more and is less likely to be possible.
And this is what secures the network. It's partially self fulfilling. The most secure network attracts the most investment and has the most computational power to back it up.
It's financial value is still in discovery and its value will not be stable until it is adopted much more widely.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:06:45
This is correct.
In a future where Bitcoin is used by the masses, there will be a LOT of competition for the small amount of space available in each block.
It is likely that there will be so much competition for on-chain transactions that the transaction fees will  be pretty significant, as a fact of life.
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:00:50
They're only interested in it because it appreciated in value. That's the only interesting part to them.
My family too was interested in Bitcoin when I gave them some and it went up in value.
Then when the price crashed, they were very uninterested in it.

What i'm not sure I understand, is what the point of bitcoin settled futures is?

@_date: 2019-05-31 02:32:03
You are right, it does matter to keep people informed.
And to the other replies, you're not thinking about the bigger picture here.
On chain transactions are eventually going to be only more and more expensive.
It will eventually get to the point where it costs a significant amount to make an on chain transaction and most of the small transactions that occur in bitcoin will happen with lightening or other layer 2 solutions.
When this hapoens, paying 40% more for a transaction by not using segwit will just be ludacris.
It will be paying 14 bucks for a transaction instead of 10. 
When exchanges and other large bitcoin companies have a choice to save 40% or to save their customers 40% they will make the obvious choice.
In the end, the most cost effective method of transacting on the bitcoin blockchain will prevail, you don't need to push or encourage people to do so, because they will, in time do it for economic reasons.

It actually doesn't matter. If people want to pay a premium to transact in legacy addresses they can do so.
I agree, everyone should migrate to bech32 going forward but if you don't you just pay higher transaction fees.
Eventually as fees go up with increased adoption, you will be at an ever more severe economic disadvantage to use legacy addresses.
In the end the free market will move all transactions to bech32 and likely beyond that to new formats as further innovations are made.
