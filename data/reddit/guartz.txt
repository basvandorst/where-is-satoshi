*sigh* I promised myself I'd stop correcting people on the internet about free markets, but this is a bitcoin forum so I'm making an exception. Reasons you are wrong, in three easy steps.
Step 1. Definition
► "free market" means a market economy in which the forces of supply and demand are free of intervention by a government, price-setting monopolies, or other authority. It does not necessarily mean a stateless society, or society that doesn't prosecute fraud.
Step 2. Assumptions
► That you can easily cheat people because people somehow forgot they are in a "truly free market" society. Even if you are in a stateless society there will still be a market demand for services such as dispute resolutions, insurances and fraud protection. If you want to do business in a "truly free market" environment, you either answer to those 3rd parties or caveat emptor.
Step 3. Repercussions. 
►Anything ranging from being ostracized from marketplace to, and especially in a stateless "truly free market" society, being fucking shot in the head *very* publicly. 
Thank you for your attention.

Tbh, I'm less interested in the scammer and more interested in how they got my cell

Thanks for all the donations. But really, we just need more miners to join us.

I'm a witness. I've personally seen you hand thousands of coins to Kerpeles. *wink, wink
@_date: 2014-06-13 05:25:20

@_date: 2014-08-07 01:17:14

Sellers take the risk of loosing coins to scams.

I'm not sure if you are intentionally this obtuse or what, but lets take a look at your counter arguments. Also I just want to point out that it's clearly evident that you want to argue against "free market" anarcho-capitalistic ideas, and I'm not sure how I got involved, but ah,okay.
Starting from the top.
prosecute/prevent, posteriori/a priori. Do you know the significance in the difference? If you are gonna call my corrections infantile, at least quote me correctly.
As far as regulation, the idea here is that those 3rd parties would be beholden to competition, much like any other entity trying to offer a service. So yes, there would be a 4th, 5th and 100th and they would all be competing for the market share of keeping me away from fraud. Do you know why is this better then having a single entity with monopoly on the market share? (aka all powerful government regulators). 
And so what if one entity has more "power" (whether it's knowledge or greater influence in the market) Why do they need to be equal? Wtf are you even saying here? When I buy a fucking pen from walmart i'm entering into a transaction without coercion and we both benefit, yes walmart has more power then me, so, effing what????!

Prosecution provides incentive against fraud, that's why the markets would care. This is related to when I said that you can have a society that prosecutes fraud in a free market environment. Are you really this dense? You argument with me consists of you blowing hot air and being consistently wrong. 
Also, players in the market that subscribe to 3rd party oversight/arbitration would have distinct market advantage over competition that doesn't and hence they would have incentives to do so. I can't believe I have to explain this to an adult. ...You are an adult, right? And these 3rd parties would have their own markets to compete in, hence further incentives to provide better service. (There is not going to be only 1 insurance company for example)
And going back to walmart example... I can just buy a pen from somewhere else. lol. You are even wrong about your big tobacco example.
And yes, I understand perfect information. I also understand why this is completely irrelevant to our conversation. (Maybe in your distant world, because man, you are far gone.) 
In short, you offered no counter arguments to my original post. You just say shit to sound smart, and you are not.

well, they called again.
Managed to write down the url they wanted me to visit. 
Anybody tech savvy want it?
@_date: 2014-08-07 00:55:24
Well, that's ugh. Somebody is gonna get infected and I don't want to be responsible for it.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:19:15
You said what everybody is thinking. Congrats on that. But also F you.
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:44:58
No, I got the same url.
@_date: 2014-08-07 00:54:31
Let's see, I use my cell for 2 way factor a lot.
The list is, in no particular order:
maybe a few more pools that I forgot about.
@_date: 2014-08-07 00:56:23
Same here bud.
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:33:38
We have to have something in common. I'm scratching my head trying to figure it out.
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:10:09
The same thing that allowed people to keep money on Gox with so many red flags. It starts with an S.

Don't have blockchain app. Don't have malware on anything I own. Super uptight about security on my devices.
@_date: 2014-08-07 02:41:54
We are trying to figure out from where our cell numbers leaked. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 00:58:28
By the way, we need to collaborate on which bitcoin services that we shared our cell, maybe if enough of us see it we can pinpoint the site.
My list:
BTC-E CEX.IO,
blockmines.com, 
Bter.com

U.S government can't even build a website properly. JUST SAYING.

Tigerdirect never gets love, they are much better for electronics.
@_date: 2014-08-07 03:06:54
Other entities hold this information, I want to know who failed me. So I can do the force choke, and say "you have failed me for the last time".
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:50:10
I don't use ebay... and I don't use your apps.
So maybe they had multiple sources? Just seems unlikely.
Did you ever buy from bitmain?
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:03:55
Litecoin, peercoin, namecoin, and maybe feathercoin. Big maybe. Everything else looks too shady for me.
