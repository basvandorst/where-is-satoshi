I'd love to do that, but for my first but I just got $10 AUD. This is scary. I still kick myself daily for ignoring Bitcoin when it started, thinking it was a fad that will burn out quickly.
How my life could have been haunts me. Nothing extravagant, but a paid off car, motorcycle and a good house deposit would mean the world to me.

Set up a $10 worth per fortnight, it's a modest start but I see profit in the future.
Also Coinbase is good to use, yes? was just a bit weird having to give ID.

Same. I now have 0.0018 worth of coin that cost me $20. Currently worth $18.65 or so but it's a start. But as I just learned, I can't sell the stuff because Coinbase doesn't support selling in Australia. Let's me buy just fine, just can't sell. It's a bit annoying.

Hey, my $20 has turned into $23.29! Now if only Coinbase would allow Australians to sell :/

Thanks, still very new :)

I guess so? Not too sure how to do that. Honestly it's only Coinbase that won't let me sell, I'm almost sure there is a way to do it in Australia.

Alright, it's time for me to get on this train and hope to make it big. What wallet do I use and how on earth does it get me coin?

Yeah I just deleted all my apps and bookmarks and am trying to forget about it all. I have nothing but profit sitting in there, took all that I put in back out when it was higher, so I really have nothing to lose. Sure I could be buying more, but I'm not fussed and have better things to do with the money.
