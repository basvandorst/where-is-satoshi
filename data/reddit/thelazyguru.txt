We already solved this non problem "problem"  
DAI is built to solve this issue and give a stable usd pegged coin no one can influence.

God are you still spamming this everywhere with fresh accounts?

In the future move it to:  1.8m is next to nothing for them to process. They have phsyical locations you can walk into. They will even send you a solid gold access card:  
Withdraw or move your cash or gold whenever you want or have them ship your physical gold to you if you want to do a scrooge mcduck reenactment.

Sort of like how transferwise.com works but for crypto?

Wasn't aware he was trying to dodge KYC. I commented purely on the ease of actually getting your funds.

Email was invented in 1972 and went through multiple changes before we got to what we have now. To put it in perspective the first MIME email attachment wasn't sent until 1992. Twenty fucking years after the invention of email. 
Bitcoin was never meant to serve the same purpose as Monero or Zcash. Its transaction time is fast, the confirmation time however is slow and both of those are still orders of magnitude faster than VISA which doesn't actually settle the books for 30 days and is subject to reversal. Your store of value argument is flawed as you are taking a very small snapshot and conveniently not zooming out to look at Bitcoin over multiple years. 
As far as acceptance maybe I'm in the minority but I don't really care if stores convert it to fiat. That doesn't change the fact that it is accepted for payment. If I see an item and can use bitcoin to pay its accepted end of story.

You can literally have a million dollars in physical cash from BTC in 90 min flat. Stop spreading this myth that its hard to get fiat.

They meet you at a bank. Are you dense? As far as Gemini why are you avoiding verification? You go through that when you sign up and any additional verification takes minutes if you have nothing to hide. Anyone at this level already has multiple accounts at multiple exchanges.
Localbitcoins can facilitate your entire cash out in 90 minutes. I provided other equally easy and very safe options for getting your money direct from an exchange. The main contention I'm addressing is "gl cashing out a mil from btc to fiat" I've provided multiple ways to do that both quickly and safely. What piece of shit bank are you at that takes 9 days for both ACH and wire transfers? I'm not sure why you have a vested interest in rallying against what is a very simple process.

Localbitcoins.com (I've had up to 500K delivered with zero issues) or contact a major exchange (Gemini, Bitstamp, etc) and they will liquidate you immediately via wire or ACH. Or use Goldmoney.com they will exchange your BTC or ETH for physical gold you can have shipped to you OR they will send you a solid gold debit card you can use to access your holding OR they will send you a wire for you balance.
Have you ever actually tried to cash out? It's probably the smoothest part of the whole bitcoin experience.

Sheesh how silly do you feel.

I usually wait for a price bump and then move my bitcoin to  and sell it for cash deposit/interac. Money hits your bank account in 5-60 minutes flat.

Yeah I know it was gutted as the old parent company basically relied on their Alibaba investment to keep them profitable. It's bizzare seeing the brand again after spending so many years as the butt of startup/investment jokes (where startups go to die... Yahoo will buy anything etc etc.)

Oooo that's a deep cut reference lolll well done. Took me right back to my religious youth!

He actually paid less than 8. He paid out in installments using compounding investment income to reduce his payable amount. I'd be surprised if he winds up paying more than 5 mill.

Good god if this is how Yahoo revives itself....

Welcome to Canada! :) Sooooo many countries have something similar just worded as a "Investor" Program. The quebec one even gives your money back after 5 years. It's structured as a "loan" to the government.
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:04:20
Err there are a ton of countries including first world ones where you can technically buy citizenship through official channels.
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:09:33
Incorrect. You can use MKR/DAI to issue yourself an instant loan with your crypto as collateral.

Then why are you here?
