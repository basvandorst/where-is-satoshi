I know - I'm just used to years of Bitcoin where I can check a cold wallet balance on a blockchain explorer.
Having a hard time with the adjustment to XMR cold storage 'blindness'

And after generating an address and storing the seed (paper and pencil) somewhere safe - how can I be confident that I will have control of the wallet on some future date?
Sending a lot of XMR to a randomly generated address is rather nerve wracking!

If their trade advice was actually good they would make money trading instead of selling access to a blog with shitty trading advice.
No, I've never subscribed but I make sure to down vote their posts whenever they spam all over Reddit

Wouldn't local bitcoins be stupidly risky?  Depending on where you meetup there is a very good chance law enforcement could use CCTV from local business and traffic cameras to identify anyone selling hacked btc...

Thanks for coming and answering questions!
I agree that running a full node on a home desktop makes sense but increasingly people have moved away from traditional computers and towards tablets and phones.  Is there a solution for these users?  Even laptops are often moved around and lack a 24/7 internet connection.
I don't have dedicated internet at my house, so what is my best way to store and use monero?

It would be interesting to see this data from each year and see how it compares.
I think that the most interesting data point is 1.2 million wallets with at least 0.1 btc ~$60).  IMO people with less than 0.1 btc don't really count for much and may never even use the small amounts in those wallets.  They also account for less than 1% of all bitcoins.
Assuming that most users have 2 wallets (not provable in any way - anyone have a better estimate?), there would be around 600,000 btc users.  Does that sound about right?  It's a fairly low number IMO

Maybe the investors are keeping him on because coinbase/gdax are *the* most prominent company in Bitcoin and they are showing huge user growth quarter on quarter ever since they opened.
Why try to bring in a new CEO when the company seems to be doing quite well from our outside perspective?  Obviously we can't see financial info or profitability but I do believe that they announced total trades/exchange has topped $5 billion earlier this year.
Brian Armstrong and his company should be thanked for helping grow Bitcoin into what it is today.

Don't click this link or buy trezor from anyone except satoshi labs directly.
Trezor is not on sale on their website and this is almost certainly a scam.
