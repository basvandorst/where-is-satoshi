First of all,  I suck at Counter-Strike!  I only know two people from Colorado, and this compulsive liar is not one of them.  
If knowledge is perceived to be equivalent to power,  then the power to control information,  to build or destroy one's own ego can provide the ultimate umbrella of deniability.  This allows one to hide in plain sight without revealing a source,  rhyme,  or reason.  It's called The Art of disinformation.  It's complicated,  so I'm afraid I don't have time to explain it to you.

It's only gobbledygook to someone that doesn't have the mental capacity to facilitate a logical conclusion based off an understanding of technical principles;  specifically,  those relating to computer science.

If you take unknown parameters from the unknown abyss of human consciousness,  the unknowns can't be defined;  however,  when you confine initial parameters to Sha-256 in the field of encryption,  then you must be willing to recognize those limitations,  which are proven to computationally be impractical to crack.  Now,  imagine plucking a cryptographic orange from a cryptographic apple tree,  then proving it that tastes like Apple.  This is what is demonstrated here .  If anyone's mathematical analysis is lacking,  it's yours.

That's the point.  Using a non-native hash to produce a vanity address when converted,  it's mind-boggling.

You don't seem to understand the burden of proof.  There is no such thing as a cryptographic card trick because algorithms use mathematics.  People lie;  math doesn't.  In order to produce a calculated result requires and understanding of math.  The end result of manipulating cryptography is empirical proof of either the ability to understand the underlining mathematics or not.  I've already presented my proof.  Now,  that I've given you something to work with,  you have to back up your story that this empirical proof is invalid.  If you can't that means your argument is purely conjecture. 
Once more,  you don't even understand the concepts of what you're claiming to understand.  I think you should be aware that I probably understand business and international law better than you.  Once a claim with evidence supports itself,  the burden of proving that evidence doesn't support itself falls on the dissenting party.

One does not need to be gay in order to appreciative all people,  including homosexuals.  That means it's easy to be "gay friendly"  without actually being gay yourself.

It's not gay.  What's gay - is everyone looking for Golden Goose riding a pink elephant.  To know that only two digits relating to non-native hash from the first version of Bitcoin could produce a 5 letter string vanity sequence,  the odds are beyond fathomable.  First of all,  the more letters required to produce this result,  the less significant it becomes.  In other words, try lining up 64 dominos,  then remove the second Domino and the 63rd -  Now tip over the first one hoping that all of them will fall down,  yet this example demonstrates that all these Dominos fall down.  Again it's not just changing two digits from a random hash;  it's very specific.

It's only barely comprehensible to someone that is able to comprehend,  anything at all.  Go troll on some other non-technical post.  Your mental capacity is obviously limited and you don't have a technical rebuttal.  This means what you're presenting here is hot air,  with no flame.  If you don't understand it,  I don't have time to explain it to you.  I don't spoon feed children.

Okay John whatever you say.  That's some poisonous tree that you have in that Garden.  Maybe a job of shuffling papers,  would be more up your alley instead of gardening.  You make a lousy troll.

I'm glad no one cares what I think because if I had one bad bone in my body or wished anybody ill,  I do have other "black hat" methods to prove who I am;  it wouldn't be pretty for anyone.

The hashes were validated by cryptographic expert.  Only two characters were changed which makes this empirical proof of an advanced knowledge of cryptography.  No one,  even from within the early Bitcoin development team would even know that a non-native algorithm would hold this hidden vanity address.  Only two characters were changed which suggests that intentional manipulation of the Genesis block code in order to produce this shared secret.  Speculation about who, why, and when doesn't even come to the equation if empirical proof is presented using cryptography.
