I won't get an ASIC as I don't want to invest any money in heating my apartment.
I haven't heard of GPUs having shorter lifespans due to high usage.
It's a net positive if you actually read my parameters. Heating the apartment + contribute for BTC by a miniscule amount.

Perhaps I got a bit too heated myself. I was basically just looking for an alternative to a simple heating element, which only produces heat and perhaps 50 Hz radio waves at most :D
Let's carry on. Happy holidays.

Yea I have multiple full nodes running.

I don't want to support altcoins. Thanks though :)

No. Back then I believe the programs only used the CPU. Or at least that's what the program I got, did :p

Let me reiterate: I do not care about profit. Also laughed on the "wear and tear of hardware" :D

Ty, but nicehash does not mine BTC AFAIK.

Are you sure? That's interesting. I thought wear and tear happened due to temperature changes.
What exctly kills the GPUs at max usage? I'm genuinely interested.
Edit: and no, I'm not building a PC for this :D Just looking for a simple alternative for an electric heater.

Imo increasing hash rate increases the security a lot more.

Supporting the network, heating the apartment.

Once more: not looking for making any profit.
@_date: 2019-12-21 00:59:27
Thanks, I'll check that out B)

Mining altcoins is not supporting BTC though. As I said, I don't care about making profit.
