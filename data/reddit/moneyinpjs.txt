its guaranteed because our promise is backed by our (already built up) ad revenue streams and all investments will increase our ad revenue and thus we can guarantee all investments can be paid 10% interest. 
I am open and honest and online on Skype (karl.moneyinpjs) is you want to talk more about how we can do this offer.
Happy New Year!

Let me know if you EVER need help and I will be here to help. ;)

they make money from ad revenue and it helps people to get into bitcoin for free. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 06:11:46
This is not a ponzi...
I run 2 bitcoin faucets and a faucet list as well as a bitcoin forum and I have a good ad revenue stream.  I use the bitcoin investments to make the ad revenue grow and then I use the money to buy Bitcoin and return the investments to the investors within 45 days. 
This is a legit offer and I am here if anyone wants more details or help.

no catch. I help others earn more bitcoin and I get a little ad revenue but that just covers my hosting costs. 
I guess you can just say I'm a nice guy and I know that by helping others build a stready bitcoin stream, I will (over time) build a nice network of people that trust me and follow me with my other bitcoin projects. 
My name is Karl, I live in NY, USA and I love Bitcoin and helping others... I know you don't see this much online but I am telling you the gods honest truth.

This is 100% legit and I offer great support on Skype: karl.moneyinpjs 
ANYONE can do this as long as you have some bitcoin to get your faucet going and then just keep it flowing to keep the revenue streams flowing. The trick is to earn more than you give and I can help with all of that and I don't charge a penny. 
I install, Host, Help you add revenue streams and Promote your brand new faucet so that your guaranteed to be a success. 
Sorry if you think I'm spamming reddit but this is the best free Bitcoin service ever to be offered on here...
For real, Others charge a lot for all the services I will do for free! 
@_date: 2015-01-17 03:05:07
yes but that would be in about 1,000 years :) 
So humans have nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:11:01
good news. now we need New York to do the same. :)

NEVER invest or "gamble" in a ponzi!
You will always lose in the end!
You Have Been Warned!

Stop trying to scam people...the bitcoin community has seen enough in the past few months. 
Think of something unique that's not a scam. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 05:12:36
I love bitcoin and want to help the community grow and this one of my ways to get my word out because I'm just a small fry in the bunch but I got some good marketing skills that I use to help others as well as myself. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 05:10:55
i'm just trying to help people.

You can still gain access if you have your account passphrase. It's the little sentence that they gave you when you made the account.
Good luck
