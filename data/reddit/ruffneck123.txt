Edit: They resolved my issue, Thanks BI
I sent a PM and will update this with the outcome

We are all getting nervous with large sums of money in limbo. You guys have been great in the past and made right on a few issues I had but this one is different and we need your devs to say "OK" sooner rather than later so we can get our coins, thanks BI

~~Bitinstant promised me 60$ worth of bitcoins about 24 hours ago and said they transferred it see here 
They have resolved my issue. Thanks Bitinstant I look forward to working with you in the future
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:56:35
It seems you have executed the orders but nothing is showing up in blockcahin.com how long do you anticipate that will come through?
@_date: 2013-06-13 15:25:57
I bet it's fixed now would be my thought, and now they have to go through hundred's of one's that go through automatically. I am no way giving them excuses because 48 hours is unacceptable  
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:53:40
FYI My order executed according to them but I do not see it in blockchain
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:28:31
I just got mine from 6/11, not to mention just because I like to live on the edge I did another for 400$ this morning 6/14 and got the coins in less than 5 minutes.
I hope it stays this way
@_date: 2013-06-13 15:36:09
Phone is all automated, they don't takes calls
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:29:37
I got the coins i made a purchase for on 6/11 and just because I like to risk my hard earned money I did a transaction this morning 6/14 for 400ish and got the coins in 2 minutes flat like it used to be
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:07:59
I am having the same issue as well. They just cannot win there is always an issue
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:47:24
Thanks for following up I have edited my posts as resolved. Now all you have to do is get some more customer service and I think you guys will be even better!
@_date: 2013-06-28 15:31:19
BTC showing up in the blockchain fyi
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:06:10
Same here
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:48:52
It is impossible to complete the transaction without the payment center locator. That seems a bit strange as you are right I know where my walmart is too.

Repsonse from zip zap
 " Claire Roberts (ZipZap) Mar 29 11:30 (PDT)
We apologize for the inconvenience. Our IT team is working on it - we are currently experiencing an issue with the 3rd party vendor that we use to locate the payment center nearest you. We would encourage you to try again in a couple of hours and hopefully the issue will be resolved by then. Thank you for your patience!" 
@_date: 2013-06-13 18:13:40
So when will we see our bitcoins???? 72 Hours later Just give an answer please I am tired of this
@_date: 2013-06-12 20:16:00
He is the owner
@_date: 2013-06-11 20:26:07
Cash deposit to address is delayed (not 1 hour or instant for that matter). This is what happened last time and I ended up loosing 60$ I have submitted to your support line and I hope they can resolve this quickly
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:05:07
Used them 6 times so far with no issue. PM bitinstant he will help you out. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:29:31
Placeholder text. Standard in all Web design 
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:00:04
Worked for me at 9am MST for a few hundred no problems 
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:21:51
Edit: Resolved
@_date: 2013-07-23 15:09:56
You were right now that I look back at this thread. I bet they hand the logs right on over
@_date: 2013-06-12 14:00:49
PSA to anyone that reads this - It has been close to 24 hours with no bitcoins in my wallet. The response I got from bitinstant was "This is a new website so there will be bugs" I don't understand what is going on there? Why have I not gotten my coins? They also removed the Q&amp;A from the help page it goes to a 404 "Sorry, We Couldn't Find That Page" Any response on this bitinstant? 
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:18:39
Edit: They have resolved this issue
I have used bit instant about 5 times so far and yes there are a ton of fees. Each time I have used them I make my moneygram transaction and not 2-3 minutes later I get a notification from block chain that I received payment of bitcoin. 1 time out of those 5 however I bought at 70ish and it took 12 hours to get my coins, by that time the rate was 100 per coin thus I lost about 60$ worth of coins. I am waiting to hear back on how they will resolve this as all the data  there and I hope they clear it up. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 23:54:56
I love the convenience of bitinstant I've only had 1 issue out of 10 times I have used them and u/bitinstant fixed it promptly. As soon as the money gram goes through I get a text from block chain saying I have gotten a payment. Keep it up and lower the fees
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:04:53
Confirmed as well, any other legitimate solutions or a way to contact them?
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:05:04
I have used them multiple times with no issues. 400-500$ worth cash to address and in most cases wally world sends the money gram and not 30 seconds after the receipt is printed I get a notification from blockchain that I received my coins
@_date: 2013-05-14 02:32:08
Thanks I will take a look at that. I went through a list of services that accept VPN and you are correct about locations and features. I only did a month to test it out.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:55:03
I have used bit instant 6 different times with no issues. Even with orders up to 400$
@_date: 2013-06-13 15:10:05
36 Hours from initial deposit for 260$ Can you PLEASE give a ETA on WHEN we will see our bitcoins
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:02:48
Been waiting since 11AM MST yesterday - ZipZap went through and no coins. I have never had an issue like this with them 
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:50:36
When using bit instant go from cash (zipzap,  moneygram) to address. You will get it within 5 minutes 
@_date: 2013-06-13 15:11:15
It has always been that way for me but not since they launched their website. They currently have 260$ on hostage and I am STILL waiting on ANY kind of response from them.
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:54:16
I don't see the transfer in blockchain do you?
@_date: 2013-06-28 15:48:09
It did show up many thanks. I do love your all's service it just really triggers the anxiety when we don't get our orders right away because I have used your service about 30 times now and only have had issues twice (5 day delay) So thanks for ironing this out quickly that really brings me to believe you are trying harder.
@_date: 2013-06-12 15:59:41
After the new website design I can confirm this - It's been over 24 hours and I have not even gotten a response as to why from Bitinstant. I would stay away until it's fixed, for now they have my $260 hostage.
