The dollar value of the bars when bitcoin is $800 is about the same as the dollar value of the bars when bitcoin is $100.  Fewer coins trade now, because the overall amount of money being pushed through the exchanges is not changing much.  Most of the traffic in BTC is off-exchange.  When there was a mania, lots of trading occurred.  That has dissipated, but is likely to return again in a few months.

You're not trying very hard.
1) You don't need any stinking confirmations unless you're dealing with large amounts of money.  Why are there unsupervised, unmanned checkouts at Home Depot, Walmart, supermarkets?  Because it's not worth the hassle to cheat them.
2) Do not protect files.  That's dumb.  If it is a large amount of money, just print it out on paper with a laser and put it in a safe place.  You are not required to be a stupid twit.  It is entirely optional!
3) Mt.Gox.  Never ever let anyone else have vast amounts of your money.  End of story.

Any time you eliminate the malinvestment resulting from artificially cheap credit, you impose a market discipline that requires economic choices to be rational and productive ones.  As a result, the efficiency and productivity of the economy is improved.
It is true that you would not enjoy the benefits of bubbles, such as the Greenspan housing bubble.  But you also avoid the much more severe harms of the subsequent crashes, such as the one we are enduring today, in which the standard of living for 90% of the population is lower than that of their grandparents, and 65% of all American children live in households receiving needs-based government benefits to aid in their support.

Things that add significant value, such as risk hedging in predictable scenarios, or compelling app use cases.  Almost all appcoin use cases are pretexts for a premine scam, but in NXT that premine play is over, and the app cases are still interesting, increasingly so.

The value of bitcoin is determined by Fisher's quantity theory of money:  PQ = MV.  From the blockchain we observe that V is roughly 6, which makes it similar to USD, for example.  M is now 12 million, 21 million in 2140 A.D., but I take it to be 15 million so that my calculations have some persistence.  PQ is the bitcoin GDP, the quantity of goods and services transacted times the price at which they are transacted.  
Western Union and Moneygram perform international remittances in excess of USD 500 bn annually.   This high-fee business is obsoleted by bitcoin, today.  If this and only this traffic is contained in PQ, the fundamental value of bitcoin is equal to USD 500 bn / (6 * 15 mn bitcoin), or USD 6700 per bitcoin.
In fact 60% of the GDP of Tajikistan consists of remittances, outside of the Western Union / Moneygram business.  I think it is safe to say that there are many other applications for which bitcoin will displace traditional cash payment mechanisms.  The global black market GDP is conservatively estimated at 2 trillion USD, and at least half of that can be improved for its participants by use of bitcoin.
Bitcoin is volatile, and will remain volatile until a mature ecosystem of market makers arises which is capable of resolving the arbitrage in the system.  However, for those who can hold it long enough, it will dramatically outperform fixed income, equities, and commodities in almost every case, over a multi-year time frame.

Not sure about 3 years, but in the longer term:
PQ = MV.  PQ is the value of goods transacted in a period.  V is the money velocity over that period and M the money supply.  For BTC M is 12,000,000 and V is 6 (current observed values). The global black market GDP is 2tln USD 2013 according to UN figurues.  That is a reasonable  minimum estimate for P*Q in the current regime  Thus a minimum value per BTC is 2tln USD / 72 mln BTC, or roughly $30,000 USD 2013, when steady-state is reached.
By the time there are 21 mln BTC, ca. 2140 A.D., P*Q might be equal to global GDP.  If global GDP grows at 1% annually during that time, each BTC will be worth 6 million USD 2013 under those circumstances.

Deflationary is not a bad thing, but the word is used in other contexts where it is bad, and people are stupid.  The bitcoin money supply is actually infinite, because the units are infinitely divisible (1e-8 now, higher exponents with a software tweak).
This: "Futhermore, bitcoin will increase in value as long as the bitcoin enconomy is growing and will decrease in value while the bitcoin economy is shrinking. Therefore spending is encouraged during times of recession and hoarding is encouraged during times of growth." That's pithy, and clear.  I like it a lot.

In that case, coinbase needs to buy BTC cheaper, and sell higher.  You should be arbing the exchanges for us, the retail users.  Then you wouldn't have to charge a 3-4% spread plus a 1% commission on every transfer.  Indeed, if you don't do this, the moment a competitor does, you will lose all your traffic.

Truly, you can't fault them for making hay while the sun is shining.  But it does foment some ill will, and it won't last long.  The first competitor with better spreads will destroy their user base.  And it's not hard to make better spreads if you use the exchanges.

Mining does, however, cause the price to rise.  As it becomes more competetive, the cost of mining rises.  Miners therefore do not sell until the price of bitcoin makes the mining profitable.  Thus, supply is constrained.  The cost of incremental coins entering the exchange market will always be higher than the ever-increasing cost of competitive mining.  Thus mining is always profitable.  Thus more and more people start mining.  Thus competition increases, ad infinitum...

Regulation E just went into effect, which makes international wires much more difficult and costly.  Upside:  Now bitcoin will be more valuable, useful.
