The dates and times are from the original contract specifications. CME Bitcoin Futures trade at CST, terminate at GMT and settle at CST. CBOE Bitcoin Futures trade and terminate at CST and settle at ET.
I converted them all times to a standardised format below to Bangkok Time (since I am based in Bangkok), adjust these dates/times to your location.

Thanks. I will edit it :-)

I assume it will mainly be institutional investors. Hard to predict, but possibly yea.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:57:34
I assume so :-/ I was quite shocked to read it in the contract specs too

Normally you enter into a Futures Contract with CBOE/CME. They are the other party (known as counterparty). If you want to enter into a futures contract with a specific person/individual/company instead of with the exchange, you can do this. The minimum size of the contract must be 50 Futures. This is called the Minimum Block Trade.
Simply put, your future contract is with me instead of with CME. We settle up the difference between us :-)

A bank like JP Morgan is not allowed to buy/sell Bitcoin. They cannot go to an exchange. They could however buy a Bitcoin Future. The Future is just a bit of paper saying you own a Bitcoin, its not a real Bitcoin. It lets the banks get around it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:37:05
Are they non-deliverable contracts?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:38:31
Many financial institutions are not allowed to buy/sell Bitcoin and/or cryptocurrency. The Futures Contract means you are entitled to a Bitcoin but do not directly own one. It gives financial institutions a bit of a loophole.

I am glad you found this helpful. I am editing it as more information comes through from different people. With many minds at work together, we should have something simple to follow :-) I am reading through your post now :-D
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:59:06
Thanks again :-)
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:42:12
You were right. Both are settled in USD. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:34:40
You are most welcome :-)
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:36:06
Yep :-)
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:12:00
Thanks for the confirmation :-)
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:21:04
I edited the post for you :-)
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:32:56
Cheers. Edited :-) I will look into the collars.

Thank you! Edited :-)

This would normally be the case. In the case of some (specific) commodities, you never receive the item. They just settle you up in cash. This is called a non-deliverable commodity future :-) Bitcoin is one of these.

They could just put an upper bar on the price swing I suppose, instead of stopping trading. I sent them an e-mail to confirm :-)

Which crypcocurrency should bribes be administered in? We need an untraceable Bribecoin ICO.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:41:54
A wonderful analogy. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:40:24
Perhaps an Apple ICO is in the pipeline!

There are unclear rules about the tax status of cryptocurrencies in many countries. Governments and regulators have yet to define whether coins and tokens are assets, currencies or something else. They have yet to determine a tax status. Ask a tax accountant about the tax status of cryptocurrency and see if they can reply. Only very few countries have rules of any kind.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:42:36
Nothing is legally wrong with tax avoidance. The main point is about govts and regulators making ex-ante decisions regarding Apple and Cryptocurrency, but with cryptocurrency treated more harshly despite its smaller size.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:43:58
Indeed. The main point was about the disproportionality of govt response for different industry sectors.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:43:09
Indeed. Tax avoidance is not illegal. The only way to prevent it would be to force every country in the world to have the same rate of corporation tax. Highly unlikely. Alternatively, cut government spending and reduce corporation tax in every country to zero.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:47:20
Agreed! Here here!
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:52:34
You see Apple for an American perspective. The US government has a dim view of cryptocurrency yet allows price gouging with Apple products. E.g. An iPhone costs $220 to produce and is sold for $600-$700.
Perhaps ask Chinese workers if they feel the benefits. China bans cryptocurrency while their workers feel the full wrath of Apple's working conditions.

@_date: 2017-11-07 17:04:38
Apologies. You are indeed correct :-)
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:01:08
You are thinking in terms of nominal amounts, not as a percentage. Nominal means nothing.
The post was not about the rights and wrongs of taxes/tax avoidance. It was to demonstrate the disproportional response of governments and regulators. While cryptocurrency is presented as a villain, larger corporations (almost five times of the entire cryptocurrency industry) actively engage in 'unethical' rather than illegal activity and are ignored, while cryptocurrency is unduly targeted. 
Cryptocurrency has no agenda, it is not centralised, it has a neutral moral and ethical status. Turning crypto into a villain is bizarre as a concept, its like saying 'Korean Won is evil, ban it' makes no sense at all. You could claim that people use crypto for illicit purposes, but I can use an iPhone or Japanese Yen for illicit purposes too.

Political grandstanding by the EU. The bill is more symbolic than real. There is little chance of it ever being paid in full, nor demanded.
@_date: 2019-04-18 10:13:39
Cheers. Recieved time looks like a better measure. It appears to be similar accross different blockexplorers too.
@_date: 2019-04-18 20:14:46
Thanks. I have been wondering this for some time. He has mined so many blocks!
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:27:17
They have been, but the chances of $15bil ever being paid is remote. This is grandstanding by the EU on the world stage to discourage other companies. The chances of them demanding full payment or being paid in full is very low. They will draw out the case for years and years then settle for a small amount when things quiet down.
@_date: 2019-04-18 08:40:02
Cool thanks :-) Any idea on how to back-date previous blocks to find out block arrivals?
@_date: 2019-04-18 07:47:54
That sounds reasonable. But without a monotonically rising time-stamp, it is difficult to determine which is the most recent block. I have found cases where the next block has a time-stamp before the last one. Seems quite strange. To analyse the blockchain, I need a more accurate time-stamp. Just wondering if it is possible to get the network-adjusted time-stamp of nodes when the block was mined since this seems more reliable than the locally accurate time :-)
