Would love to participate. Anyways I live in Europe so an online part would be nice.
May I ask why you can't come to Europe if you are that wealthy now?

Not sure whether this is only about US charities but I'd like to recommend you BFmF e.V.
It's originally a German education center for Muslim women. They have the opportunity to get educated in many different areas of life. This is really important since many of them lack in general education.
Additionally since the refugee crysis started, BFmF is offering refugees (male and female) German language courses and consultation in finding an apartment, dealing with public administration and much more. Feel free to check out their website at  or contact them via Kontakt - anyways cheers to your altruism. You make the world a better place.

Hmm I was hoping it would just create a wallet and print the address and private code.

I've just seen them on vacation in Sofia now. Never seen them before. Pretty sure there are none in Germany.
But thanks for the information!

Is there any proof you are the real Mark? AMAs usually have proof. At least the mods.
