I think noone really know. Also, perfection is the enemy of pragmatism.
There is a lightning network on the test net. We need to iron out any remote possibilities of loss of coins, which means a whole lot of testing. We need to improve routing resilience quite a bit. But that is all that is really needed before we can actually start using it in some meaningful way.
Once this is in, I am sure it *will* be rolled out on main net. Not because Core or Lightning Labs says so, but  because it provides a useful service that someone needs. 
It is open source, the software is there, the documentation to set it up exists. Go on, play with it today. If you want to do it on main network, *noone* can stop you. There are no changes  needed to bitcoin network, everything is ready in that end. 
But: This is money we are talking about, loss of BTC is not an option for most people. Before Lightning Labs, Blockstream and ACINQ says it's ready to use on main net, they'll have to be 100% sure themselves. They litereally have to error on the safe side. Now, if you and I decides that it is safe enough for us, this is purely on us, and we can decide what level of risk that is correct for us.

Because they are a protest movement against BTC?

I think that until channel factories and funding layer comes, we will see centralization around exchanges, larger commercial actors plus a few idealistic entities.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:12:03
Depends. The time it is confirmed corresponds to the time a block was mined. There is a finite number of transactions in a block, and it's doable to read them all.
If there is only one transaction in that block where that amount was sent, I guess it is *possible* that you could find this information with some luck. At the very least, you can limit it to a few.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:36:37
Take a look at this one:
Your transaction will go through soon after we start eating into the grey field towards the top :)
Usually, mempool goes down over a weekend. Wouldn't be surprised if it went through tomorrow.
Edit, an explanation: Your transaction had a fee of 134 sat/b, which is in the high end of the 100-140 range, which is the grey area in the graph.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:02:47
I'd not recommend running a lightning network server without a thorough understanding of how it works.
Of course you might want to hire someone on a project basis, which *should* cover your training period too.
WOn't be me, I have a day job, though :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:45:48
I see it as a good thing in the long run. Massive, subsidized mining monopoly is not good.
And if this will be orderly and not suddenly, the network will cope just fine with it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:04:10
Well, there are proof of concept implementations of atomic swap with Lightning Network.
But I think the OP meant when you withdrew, yet. And whoever implements it first will have a tremendous advantage.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:33:18
THat is a non-segwit address. Don't use it, it's going to cost you more fees, and not enable future enhancements.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:31:19
This would be up to the wallet. There is space in the payment request format for a bitcoin address too, if he wants to do an on-chain payment.
Right now, I think it fails, though. This can always be improved upon, user experience wise.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:52:23
If tether implodes, the following will happen:
- Anyone holding tether will be bag holder, obviously.
- Any exchange that deals in tether will be in a bad situation
- All crypto will equally take a credibility hit, but in the long run, it will probably pick up, and this time without the tether uncertainty over it.
Your bitcoin is not *backed* by tether. Any downfall of bitcoin will be by association only, and it will not hit only bitcoin but all crypto equally.
If you are scared about this, you probably have too much exposure to crypto. Personally, it's only part of my risk assessment.
My risk avoiding strategies here, would be:
1) Never deal in tether myself
2) Try to avoid storing anything on an exchange that is involved in tether.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:46:10
I  replicated this, and you seem to be right. What is the reason you didn't let electrum generate? You wanted 3xx addresses?
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:06:46
You are misunderstanding. Any funds not in a payment channel will have to added by an on-chain transaction. You can not "re-use" the balance before someone has paid you over the channel.
Now, it will be possible at some point to spread a large payment into several small, thereby using several channels. But that is not the same.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:11:36
It is possible to create the *funding* transaction on a hardware wallet, and just keep the keys to the multisig addresses in the LN channel. 
Technically, I guess it would also be possible to make a hardware-wallet backed lightning daemon, that needs the hardware wallet to open or close a channel. Problem is that cooperative closes from the other party will become quite difficult, then :)
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:22:05
But the *costs* of running a lightning node is not high. So there will be healthy competition. I also expect exchanges, Amazon's et all to provide this service for more or less nothing because it makes sense for them.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:06:09
And is safe, so that if you run away at the end, the bar owner gets his money anyway because you have digitally signed all your spends.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:51:32
Nodes doesn't "vote" per se, but they decide what transactions they see as valid. So, if I run a shop and run my own full node, and you pay me with money you got in a transaction that my full node didn't recognize, as far as I am concerned, your coins doesn't exist. Period.
Enough people do that, and your coins are essentially worthless. Second rang.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:27:33
Actually, it's not. Those that start with b are the future, but currently a bit bleeding edge. That is, it's getting much better now, but I think I might still go for 3-addresses.
I'm not an electrum user - does this make sense for you?
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:21:49
Still a decent chance
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:33:53
There might be. But it won't require most resources. The most resources would have to go into build the operating model and the security around it. I personally would do it, if I could:
- Make funds available in a smart contract, where I control my funds (i.e. can revoke the contract - not necessarily immediately, but at least within a reasonable timeframe), and allows the funds to be used in Lightning Channels and *only* there.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:05:22
1) You create a channel in the end of weekend, or long-time beforehand. There's no way to "cheat" the fees.
2) See 1), but in addition - make sure that you actually *get* incoming BTC to the existing channels, too. That way, maybe you won't have to top up that often?
3) If you are only doing small transactions, it's likely you won't do many. But doing transactions larger than 1 BTC or such, it might still make sense, and might be necessary (because of channel balances)
4) You don't have to close an open channel. Ever. Unless you absolutely need to spend those coins in a non-LN transactions.
5) Maybe. In LND, there is an "autopilot" feature, which tries to create channels that actually make sense. You can set limits as to how many, and how much funds is allocated to it etc. I am yet to be convinced that I actually want this. But I might, we'll see :)
6) One alpha wallet today; Eclair: Open LN wallet, scan the QR code, press "pay". It won't beat the "tap" feature, though, but close. But QR code is just a transport mechanism, it is of course possible to do it via NFC or bluetooth or such instead...we'll see what wallets decide to implement!
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:28:38
Is there a guide about fees, what to do, what not to do, and how to lower them?
Fwiw, myself I know quite a bit about this issue and know how to use the fee estimators out there and what to expect. But we need to have somewhere to point newbees.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:05:12
While this is cool, there are some corner-case money-loss bugs left, where the solution to it is generally known.
There's a risk involved with running Lightning on mainnet now. I wouldn't open large channels.
There's also a 100% chance that you'll have to close your channels at some point in the near future if you want to apply updates. The DB migration tool is not being used/updated now during development phase.
That said, the tests that developers now are doing on the main net is a necessary step to getting a beta out. But to take it as a sign that it's bugfree is a bit premature.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:38:36
At the moment: only if you are brave and knowledgeable :)
There's still some bugs, mostly affecting usability and the possibility of finding a route to pay.
There's still likely that there will be updates that breaks the DB format, and since LN is not released, the system to migrate DB to new format is not actively maintained, really. This will lead to you having to close channels before updating software. An annoyance.
Basically: You can run it on mainnet, but noone really recommends it. Those who do it now, are the early birds :)
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:05:11
If this is in "one chunk" (UTXO), it is 166 bytes for a segwit transaction, so it will be 83000 sat, which is 0.00083 BTC.
Think of the chunks like if you were paying for cash transactions by the weight of how much you transfer. Sending a lot of small coins would be more expensive than one large coin.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:19:35
This should work on any recent Linux, at least.
Note: testing should be done on test network, it's not useful really to do on the mainnet yet.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:06:07
There is a large community working on it on the  test net. But not only that: there have been successful pretrials on the main chain. It's still going to be at least a few months until we see more permanent lightning network on the main net, though. Be patient. It will be here.

Dollar amount doesn't really say anything. What was the amount in satoshis/byte?
If you feel like it, you can PM me your tx id I can give you an estimate. But note that you give up some privacy to me - however I can not steal your funds or anything that way.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:40:59
While I can see the fun people see in this, I don't see this behavior as something that helps people take BTC serious. All you do, are confusing people as to whether or not BTC community is as toxic and hell-bent on ridiculing others as the BCH community.
We don't need that, the facts will be enough.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:16:27
I don't think we need to force anything. Anyone who needs it will use it. Let the FUDsters fud, and let's just show people that it works. There will be vendors using it, we have already seen that.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:43:38
To anyone, of course. Lightning is a network. However, I think it's more 3 than 2 tx, because they are slightly larger/more expensive.. .

..and who do you think *pays* for that insurance? The credit card companies? They bake it into the transaction fees...and who pays the transaction fees? The shops? They'll just charge the customers - i.e. you - a higher cost for it.
No, you, we and all of us are paying for that credit card fraud. Don't believe anything else.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:30:56
Even though this is meant as either a joke or some FUD, I will still answer:
Lightning Labs has, Lightning is a protocol and doesn't.
In reality, open source software have been funded mostly by companies for more than 15 years, ever since they realized that open source made sense also for them.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:06:35
This is financial software. If it was a web server, a video player, a game, whatever, the risk of releasing too early isn't *that* large :)
People tend to be grumpy when software mess up their finances.
That said, the info I had is that there is a few more "database-breaking" changes in store, but not many. Once *that* is done, it'll be a whole lot less hassle to get it ready for mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:14:34
Funds will have to be used in the channel they are added. However, you can pay from any channel, and you'll probably be able in the future to split up a payment into several smaller that can be routed different ways.
But you can have as many payment channels as you like.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:23:47
You just make sure you always transfer *to* segwit. Always. Forget ever putting more in a non-segwit address. Then, move the rest of it, what is lagging behind in non-segwit, later. At spending time, you might consider spending from non-segwit, if it makes sense. Especially if it eats multiple UTXOs. It's better than transferring to segwit, and after that spending segwit...

@_date: 2018-01-20 15:23:43
There is not.
But, there is no need to use the fee estimates in mycelium. You should be pretty safe for a confirmation in an hour or two with 70 sat/b, and my guess is that 50 sat/b will confirm during the weekend. That is just a guess, though.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:07:20
I will be happy with a moderate growth from here and up. I don't *personally* need the price to pass the ATH any time soon. It's better with stability than large swings and crypto craze! Probably it'll ease the fee situation, too.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:56:38
There seems to be various scenarios here.
1) It won't be possible to open/close a channel because of main chain congestion
2) There won't be any incentive for miners.
Pick one problem. They are mutually exclusive :)
In reality, I think the answer lies somewhere in between. Fees will go down a bit, congestion will ease, but if main-chain don't get any usage/fees are low, it will again be used :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:58:49
I don't sell. While I recognise that there is a risk tether will drag the market down for a while, I also acknowledge there is a risk tether does not go poof, and they manage to show they are good. If that happens, we might see a rapid rise.
I also believe some tether risk is already priced in.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:39:57
safe as in noone can steal your coins. But you lose some privacy, and people will be able to see other transactions that these addresses are involved in, etc
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:58:08
I am not sure I advocate this, but: I am quite sure it will be possible to actually subscribe to have a channel to a more trusted LN node. Then, you can:
- open firewall only from that node.
- subscribe/pay for guaranteed channel liquidity. If It's out, they will open a new channel  to you.
- Any counterparty risk for you is reduced to between you and that trusted node.
Not sure it will be good for those who deals in grey market areas, but for anyone else it will be a valid choice.

@_date: 2018-01-03 08:28:09
It's acually not going to be a hard job doing it, at least not if you run an LN node for free. And there is a reward if you catch any cheaters!
I think there's going to be fierce competition here too, possibly a free service. Remember: Everyone that runs a lightning node is basically interested in keeping lightning safe.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:52:58
First, if they are in a non-segwit wallet, you *will* have to do a on-chain transaction to get them to segwit. Your strategy doesn't really work, you can get them to Samourai, but it will not be segwit transactions when you spend them.
 is a good site to estimate what fees are currently confirming. The yellow band is the 50-70 sat/b band, the blue below is 30-50.
If you had sent a transaction with 70 sat/b, it'd already have gone through by now.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:25:47
2140. And bitcoins lifespan won't be nearing a close, there's still mining fees to be had when mining blocks.
The difficulty will adjust to make sure there will be 6 blocks mined per hour even then.

This is his opinion. I think in reality, people will do what makes sense for them economically.
I use segwit - and will be using LN soon.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:33:27
I think it will be used on mainnet as soon as some people trust it enough. Anyone can do it *now* if they want to. And there's noone to ask permission from....
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:44:01
What will you be selling?
I'll probably be one of the early adopters as soon as it makes sense for me, i.e. as soon as I know there will be 3 transactions on my first channel :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:19:42
I don't recommend using lightning on mainnet yet. It's not that ready, even if it may seem like it is.
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:12:40
This is wrong.
This refund transaction is not commited to the chain but are held onto by both parties (and possibly watchers), and can be updated at any time - *including the timelock*
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:11:43
It's likely we'll see the first picture at the first. But what happens if routing is unstable, because some of the central nodes goes down too often?
This is pretty predictable: Someone else will pick up the slack, new channels are created to route around the instability. Over time, the network will move towards looking more like the green network. Not totally, of course, but both of the left images are quite unlikely. People will open more than one channel, and there will be lots of redundant paths between these "hubs" we are talking about.
I think it's unlikely that every lightning node, including mobile phones and those on laptops will be routing much traffic. Of that, we agree. But among the routing nodes, there will be a network of redundant paths.
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:53:22
Lightning isn't meant to be like that. So, if you want to settle, you have to make all other 1000 people settle too?
Instead, you will route payments through a series of channel until it reaches its destination. Now you can pay anyone on the network, provided there are suitable channels between you.
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:05:30

@_date: 2018-01-22 13:12:29
No. It is a way to create a favourable transaction to mine that will not be mined unless the stuck transaction is mined. It is a last resource, I agree, but definitely possible.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:45:03
Problem is, starblocks is it's own node, and I think it's likely there's not many channels into it. Also, I think they don't send LN transactions out of it often enough. In a real scenario, a coffee shop would probably sell bitcoins almost immediately.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:02:10
"Ported"? The software is of course expected to run on main net, but it will have to be new nodes :) Or at the very least, the configuration have to be scrapped, new channels obviously have to be put in place, etc.
When that happens, I *expect* that a lot of those who have testnet nodes today will run mainnet nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:41:49
This might be speculation. But, to do segwit transactions, people will actually have to get their coins to a segwit wallet. This is a non-segwit transaction. When fees decrease, more people will find it feasible to move their coins to a segwit wallet, thus bringing the number of segwit transactions down?
It doesn't necessarily mean that they will want to spend them just afterwards, though, and increasing the segwit transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:16:14

Segwit is as on-chain as non-segwit. Do not believe all you hear from the opposition. The difference is that signatures in a different *part* of the block.
All this talk about less security is actually nonsense. It's a matter if miners do the job they are set to do, or not. If they don't, they risk creating a hard fork if you mine invalid transactions, and that is *exactly* the same risk wherever you put the signatures.
If you mine invalid transactions, you create a hard fork, because noone else will follow that chain.

Jury is still out. There are research suggesting only one person was behind the tremendous rise of BTC before MtGox. It's *not* inconcievable that BCH price is artificially inflated, backed py people willing to use a couple of millions on repeating their BTC success on a new coin.
It's also quite possible it gets its value because people are crypto-crazy nowadays, and the 0.1-0.15 BTC is the natural range of it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:23:46

You'll not use this peer to peer.  You'll use same channel  (or set of channels) to pay everyone else via LN network, and if you get BTC from somewhere, you'll get them via them too. That tops up/balances the channels again.

Personally, I use Samourai. Sure, it's touted as alpha quality, but in reality I have not had any problems to speak of. I am not using it as my main wallet but as my "on the road spending wallet", and quite frankly, there's not that many spending opportunities yet that it gets used often :)
But as always, *remember to keep your seed words safe* :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:34:09
I don't really understand the question.
But: Lightning Network needs a proper blockchain - or at least a guaranteed funding layer below - to work. The very fundamentals of Lightning Networks are based on this. You can't move the layer below it to above it, it makes no sense.
Does this answer your question, or did I misunderstand your question?
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:34:04
There's still spam, though...
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:25:17
The answer is: A node makes money because it saves *them* fees. The centralized super-nodes are a myth, they won't be created simply because there's not a lot of money to be made. In reality, I believe those who take payments in BTC will be those who run nodes. Bitpay will also most likely run a node, because if it doesn't, it'll go out of business....
Sure, there will be some centralization around the *destinations*. Like exchanges, Amazon (who can now start taking payments in  bitcoin), etc. And those places will probably also do a fair share of routing, because there's really no extra cost to it.
But in reality, any node that has more than one channel can route, and there's no extra cost to it. If it makes sense to use it, it *will* be used.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:41:21
It actually improves it slightly. Any node on the road to the destination only knows the next hop it needs to send it to, so it's only the destination that knows where it comes from.
Now, of course it's possible to do analysis on a lot of stuff to gather more info, but that is at least what is directly available.
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:26:13
And to answer myself: This reward is taken from the fraudsters funds. The rest of the fraudsters funds is going to the other party.
Everyone but the one trying to do the fraud is winning. This will be prohibitely expensive to do, with an almost guaranteed loss of funds on the off chance that you'll succeed by sheer luck one day.
There will not be people that try to cheat for a profit, at least. They might try to cheat for creating damage, but it *will* come at a pretty high cost. And it's unlikely that it will cost anyone but themselves any funds at all.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:52:19
First, there is an explanation. I even was part of it myself, though now I am out.
I did the bitcoin.com mistake myself, and, as an experiment, I signed up for a small cloud mining contract.
Now, I had the choice between BCH and BTC all the time, and could even let it switch based on what was most profitable. Though, as I don't really believe in the viability of BCH in the long term, I found it easier to just let it mine BTC. So I always kept it on BTC.
I guess he'd have more BTC contracts than only mine.
Now, bitcoin.com mining is moving out of China, and I, as holder of a "life time contract", was given the choice:
- All of my inital FIAT investment back (in BCH)
- Wait to some time in april and continue the contract.
I decided to opt out at this time, getting BCH from my original contract, and ended almost at break-even, crypto-wise, on the contract.
Reasonably satisfied by not having a stake there anymore.

You need a payment channel with someone else, of course, that is connected to the lightning network. But this can be through several hops.
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:21:50
The "cost" of running such a service would be virtually zero if you already have a place to run it. There is a reward built into the anti-fraud mechanism, so it's likely there will be people doing it only for the possible reward. At least if they already have a lightning node.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:05:43
I can.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:55:56
Ok, the main bitcoin blockchain. There also exists a test version - where the coins aren't worth anything, so you can just spend, test, lose, whatever your needs are.
It's where software is tested together with other software, so developers know it's safe to use.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:42:03
This is money we are talking about. You'll not have the developers say it's ready before it is :)
Brave souls is already using  it in more or less controlled trials on the main net. I think it will be used before it's officially released. But I can in no way recommend it. If it was some useful service for me where I could pay with LN tomorrow, I might feel brave :) But it would be on my own responsibility.
When it will happen? No idea. Maybe sooner than we think.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:03:45
You can, but there is serious risks still. There are still bugs, some users have lost funds.
At this point, there's probably not much use for it. Be patient :)
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:36:14
The fee has nothing to do with the *amount* in BTC to be sent, but rather as "the complexity" of the transaction. When you get bitcoins in a transaction, you are getting it in one UTXO. Even if you get another payment to same wallet and even same address, it will be a different UTXO. If you send transactions with multiple UTXO, this will make your transaction larger in size. And this has *nothing* to do with size in BTC.
1 BTC or even 100 BTC might be 1 UTXO and very cheap. But it might be 100 UTXO and very expensive.
A Segwit transaction with 3 UTXO will be cheaper than a non-segwit transaction with 3 UTXO. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:18:50
It's not wasted if it replaces 3 on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:24:35
Nah. You'll need to buy 10000 pizzas for 2 BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:57:41
Brave souls are running it on mainnet already. In reality, I do think running it on the mainnet currently will create an extra annoyance or two - like having to close all channels before a necessary software update. Keeping state during upgrade is not a main priority right now, as it's not officially released.
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:48:53
So do I. It's even more fun playing with it on the testnet. I'm not even that interested in the price anymore :) (I came to realize tech is more fun, and I know that my BTC holdings is no more than I can afford to lose, so I just ignore it for now)
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:44:15
I think it's a myth that a lightning node needs large amounts of BTC.
My guess, however, is there will be a room for a business segment, running lightning nodes as a service, who cater to those who needs large initial channels for receiving, and SLA etc., and don't want to do it themselves.
Remember: This will be a mesh, and different ways to route. Channels will reduce in size, and fill up again when BTC flows the other way. Heck, smart nodes might even charge negative fees whenever they need to fill up a balance, because it'll cost much less than  opening a new channel.
It's really only in the endpoints we are "bleeding money". And even those will have to either restock BTC (via lightning from exchange?), or get rid of BTC (via lightning to an exchange?).
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:09:22
Then you're going to be very happy to know that you can use the same channel for paying several (all?) people/places, this is the *network* part of the Lightning Network.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:41:35
Sure, but there won't be a lot of fees to gain from it.
I think some centralization is inevitable. I guess prime suspects of running nodes will be exchanges. Another possibility is the Amazon's out there.
Those will be used by a lot of people.
Will this be centralization? Yes, but only out of practicality, and you can easily route around it....
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:56:14
Whenever you move coins, always try to move it to segwit addresses. It's probably not worth it to move coins for holding only to segwit addresses.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:02:41
I do understand that it's a significant risk we can fall in the double-digit percentage because of it. But the amount of tether is only a  fraction of the larger cryptocurrency value, so any *real* and not psychological exposure is pretty limited.
Anyone who can not afford to keep their current portfolio during a year or two, should do their own risk assessment. But there's no need to create exaggerated fears. Any downfall will be *because* of fear. Irrational fear is usually a bad idea.

I'd recommend playing around on the testnet first.
It's educational and fun.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:51:55
I wouldn't see the reason for this.
LN is for when you want to use coins, not for when you don't want to use them... :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:26:27
Oh, there is a way to top up. You need to send bitcoin *to* it. Moreoever, if all you ever do from a Lightning wallet is spend, the counter-party risk that someone is so fond of pointing out is actually gone.
- If you have 2 BTC and all you want to do is spend, put them *all* in your lightning channels. Ok, you will probably over time want more than one channel, so don't put all in same channel.
- If you are basically spending some then getting some then spending some then getting some, you will be fine. You just need to be sure you actually get over lightning transactions too. This fills up the channels again. Remember, balance flows back and forth between parties in a channel.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:39:20
Yah, I submitted some logs and helped fix one bug, so far.
This *is* open source. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:38:46
Because it's on-chain :)
Let me explain: The actual allocation of bitcoins to an LN channel is a real, mined transaction. This means the coins can't be spend elsewhere than in that channel before the channel is closed again.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:35:26
If you want to disappear forever, you'd close the channel. The other party can't *lie* about sending the payment, it's cryptographically proven that he did.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:36:43
Sure. But once LN is here, and other exchanges use it, they will be at a massive disadvantage.
And this seems to indicate that Coinbase is already feeling the pressure...
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:48:08
Segwit is just a new address format. Be sure to always use it, as it enables a lot of new technology both now and in the future, and it lowers fees.
Lightning? It's not really released yet, though you can see a video about it being used here:
There exists also other demo videos and explanations, if you just google for it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:30:27
Please remember: This is still considered a test, and everyone on this network have to understand:
- *All* channels will have to close at some point because of a software update.
- At no point have anyone stated that the software is free from "losing your coins" bugs!
This, I guess, is the reason you're not seeing more money commited. It's good that people at least are a bit responsible.
LN is getting closer to ready, but let's not rush a launch!
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:04:39
Shit will hit the fan. The markets doesn't buy it, BCH is not gaining price over time in relation to BTC. Sure, there are some outliers, but usually the price declines again. Right now, it's down to &lt;0.16 BTC after having been &gt;0.2 BTC. 
And trend is downward.
My expectaction for now is that this trend will go on until we close in on 0.1 BCH per BTC.
The real change now is that coinmarketcap actually ignore the Korean pump-and-dump markets, because there's very little interdependency between them. Due to that, "official" BCH price is down 10% as compared to BTC. 
Long term is what matters. Keep calm and carry on.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:40:54
...and next month, you pay through the same channel. And if in the meantime, others have joined the network, you can pay them too.
I see so much FUD because people don't understand that a payment channel will live for 100s of transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:16:34
I think most users will  keep channels open much longer, if the fees remain high.
I see no reason to settle a channel that still has balance, as a non-business user. Businesses might have other requirements.
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:46:08
yes. But the fees will be small, rather than large, since the barrier to entry is low. If you set fees to high, someone will underbid you and your node will not be used :)

@_date: 2018-01-29 13:53:38
I am not even going to bother trying to deduce *anything* about the permanent setup from this network. 
You have to understand that this is a *test* in production. Everyone on that network understands that channels have to be taken down again before updating software beyond certain points, which are kind of wasteful with real BTC. You will not add more channels than you strictly need for the tests you are doing.
Also note: This will likely improve over time. Any node on that network *can* open a channel to *any* other node. If there is routing issues, this is likely to happen. This increases decentralization over time. Now, noone is really going to bother with that before it's absolutely necessary *right now*, because we're still in the test phase. It was actionally not intentional that we also have early adoptors at this point. All of them have been warned that this is still considered testing phase. None of them will waste money on fees for channels they'll have to have to tear down again.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:25:04
Mmm, I guess I will have to accept that with bitcoins, I am my own bank. No insurance. I trust the tech.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:24:12
Still. It's much "easier" for a knowledgeable person to protect against crypto fraud than CC fraud. With crypto, you are in control yourself, with CC there's all sort of places that have your credit card details stored and misuse of that is quite a big issue.
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:51:56
chains? You mean channels?
It's cryptography that protects it. Each transaction/status is in effect an unsubmitted blockchain transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:32:54
I agree that having LN being a hot wallet is the biggest issue. But did you know that it's possible to just create the funding transactions  in another wallet (say a hardware wallet) and have the LN wallet only have the keys to what is in the channels? I think I am going to employ that strategy. As LN matures, I am quite sure there will be user friendly solutions for that.
@_date: 2019-07-28 10:45:52
This is precicely the reason why anyone sending/accepting BTC transactions should run a full node.  
A full node will not accept a  transaction or a block that's not following the rules of the blockchain. Should the chinese miners be duly influenced by the chinese authority to change bitcoin to their liking, they won't be able to spend the bitcoin they earn from it.  
While mining is centralized in china, I don't think you can say the same about the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem.  The 30% remaining hash rate would churn out blocks at a rate of 1 per 30 minutes until the next difficulty adjustment, when things will start normalize.  
Congrats, a new hard fork, China Coin is born, bitcoin will work without them.

@_date: 2018-01-29 10:59:02
It's obvious that other camp does feel the heat of Lightning Network. You can see it in the uptake of FUD that increases with any progress reported.
That said: Everyone should understand that Lightning Network isn't totally ready, and there is still significant risks due to bugs existing. People are losing money, but no more than was expected at this point. This is why the average channel size is now just about $50 - because everyone understands the risks.
Do not trust any analysis that comes from the BCH camps. I have seen a lot of lies about how Lightning Network actually work - either due to them not actually knowing better, or due to malice to create fear.
I will just remind everyone that Andreas Antonopolous videos are usually a good source of education, and that there is a *safe* way to test this yourself, and that is the bitcoin test network.
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:29:05
It's not as simple as that.
I wrote an opinion piece on my blog where I try to explain more.

I agree that there might be some temporal centralization. But the point is: This is a magnitude easier to deal with/solve than a centralized layer 1 (the blockchain itself).
The old meme, "the internet treats censorship as damage and routes around it" comes to my mind here. This is enteriely volountarily centralization, but if it causes damage, it will be routed around.

1) Bitcoins trilemma: Scalability. Security. Decentralization. Pick two, but \*three\* at the same time is nearly impossible.  
2) A fee market is \*needed\* sooner or later to  pay for security. It's much better to establish one gradually than discovering that your hash rate has dwindled to \*nothing\*, thuse there's no fees to pay for it. This will also be a vicious circle - would anyone pay for transaction on a chain with low security? Probably, but it will not be enough.  
That said, you can totally create something based on the blockchain, achieving the 3rd thing while doing some tradeoffs on the two you have onchain. Now, you can't really compromise on onchain security, you'd want to maximize that one. Compromising on decentralization is also a risk.  
LN is exactly such a solution. It achieves capacity by compromising a little on the decentralization and security aspects:  
\-  Security compromise: you and/or a watchtower need to periodically check for submission of old channel states.  
\- Decentralization compromise: There is some centralization pressure in the liquidity issue.  
Both of them are acceptable tradeoffs to me, for spending money, but I'd of course not put all my bitcoins in LN channels. At least not yet :) Each and everyone has to decide what tradeoffs are worth it. But you can't have it all onchain. You have to compromise to achieve the 3rd property.
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:20:28
Not much difference will happen, feewise, is my guess.  
Already, when fees get low, we have this company that is called Veriblock, that uses a lot of transactions and pushes the price up again. Lowering the fees will just allow Veriblock or someone else to take up more space, and in not too long, fees are high again.
It's better to design systems so that we can use block space more effectively, allowing us to pay more fees for the block space "before it hurts". This forces these secondary use cases to either do the same or stop transacting.
It's a bad idea to decide your block size around the "fees should be low" mantra, becauser there will \*always\* be demand for space on the most secure PoW block size in the world.  
Block size should be designed to continue being the most secure, most trustless blockchain in the world. Being cheap is easy. Being trustless and secure is what's valuable.

First, you need to understand that contrary to popular opinion, there's no central authority on Bitcoin development.
However, the dominant node software is Bitcoin Core, so it's likely that whatever is in bitcoin core roadmap will end up to be bitcoin features.  
Now, who controls bitcoin core? That again has a fairly decentralized development team, with some developers paid by various companies, some independent. The lead developer - who maintains that his role is more of a janitor - is Wladimir J Wan Der Laan, who works at MIT Digital Currency intiative.  
You might have heard that Blockstream runs Bitcoin. They do have a stake in development, as they pay a few Bitcoin Core developers. Their reason for this funding is of course that their business model depends on a working bitcoin, so in line with what's normal in open source, they help fund development. That said, without finding a direct source, I have heard that their working contract is pretty specific about their work on Bitcoin Core is not to be influenced by the company, their work there is their own.  
There is of course no requirement to run Bitcoin Core, and being open source software it can, and has been, forked. Users of it tend to stick with Bitcoin Core when running on the real bitcoin  Blockchain (BTC), because that's where things will be happening.  
So, what can we expect? 
A few things that's currently being discussed:  
Taproot and Schnorr: [ 
SIGHASH\_NOINPUT: [ \- improvements mainly benefiting Lightning Network.
Improvements/merging of Neutrino, which is a better SPV node protocol that Lightning Network light nodes uses.  
More? Probably, but those were the ones I remembered off the top of my head :)

Well, to be honest, I think they won't actually steal your money, so in that regard it's safe. But take care to not buy Bitcoin Cash instead, because you might come across they label it as bitcoin. It should have the bitcoin cash price, though.  
But well - I myself have a hard time justifying buying  bitcoin from an enemy of bitcoin. Yes, not only a competitor, they actively work against bitcoin, with fear, doubt and propaganda.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:00:46
The exchanges intentionally overpay, because they know that they will get customer complaints if the bitcoins are not there almost instantly after withdrawing.
Look at  - if you see the tiny strips at the top? That's where you end if you overpay. And it's normally totally unneccesary.
Moreover, many wallets are sort of stupid. They look at the mempool, and see "what is the highest fee in the pool"? And then they pay *more* than that, just to be sure the transaction is in the next block.
If anyone wants to save money on fees, I urge them to start using custom fees and *understand* the graph above.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:57:39
It's not the hard drive space. It's the bandwidth.
Any miner not getting the blocks fast enough is going to be at a serious disadvantage, because he'll not be told to start mining a new block as early as the others (a bit simplified). Thus, the larger the block size, the more miners will have to reside in only high end data centers.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:11:43
Every channel is independent. Never do you have to close a channel because another channel had to close.
A channel can be topped up, either by sending coins in the other direction via lightning network, but I have also heard that the act of adding more coins to a channel might be done with just one on-chain transaction too, soon now.
The more redundancy there is, the less likely it is that channels have to close. Sometimes it will have to take a longer way, but hopefully over time interconnection-channels will even out so that
BTC flows in each direction and almost never depletes totally. Now, single entities, like you or a shop, might need to close a channel. But that shouldn't affect the network that much. You will most likely have more than one channel, a shop would definitely have more than one channel.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:55:50
There is a narrative in certain other circles that only mining nodes count. I will debunk this:
Unless all miners only get their blocks by direct links to each others (but this is a likely scenario with big blocks, and is one of the centralization characteristics that big blocks will lead to), there will be non-mining nodes in between. If they stop invalid blocks, mining invalid blocks *will* lead to forks. As it should be. Mining invalid blocks is not valid according to the rules of the network, but they are still valid according to the rules of they node they are mined on, so it is a fork.
Even if all miners colluded and had their own network and shared blocks with each others - if the rest of the network runs a large proportion of full nodes, it will be difficult to *spend* transactions from invalid blocks. Anything that is built on top of invalid blocks is also invalid. This would also be a hard fork. Now, the miners have effectively forked away from the network. Good luck spending any "valid" coins, when they have nowhere to use them than send them to each others :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:55:38
Of course it is a problem. But it needs a good solution that does not destroy other properties, namely the decentralisation aspect, of Bitcoin.

Coinbase pays a very high fee, and does nothing to reduce it, just passes it on to the user. Fee there is always high. Moreover, transactions from coinbase also is a large part of the number of transactions, which means that them not implementing segwit (which effectively makes room for more transactions) also affect a lot of others with higher fees.
And it is also possible to send to more than one in the same transaction. Since they are always sending a lot of transaction, this makes sense. While it is more expensive to send such transactions to more people than to one, it is much less expensive than sending them separately, and it takes less space on the blockchain, making the fees smaller for everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:30:19
It's quite simple to understand corrections.
At some point, people start to think "ok, this is freaking insane gains! I will sell!". Once enough people do that, usually around psychologically important numbers (like, close to 20k), it will affect the price. This will make other people think "fuck, it's going a little down! I'll cash out *my* gains here". And bring the price even more down.
And this will continue until it meets the "fuck! these coins are cheap now. It has to go up now!"-crowd.
It's not magical at all.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:59:23
Did you use a segwit transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:50:07
Say, we have:
Now, for A to be able to pay B 1 BTC, A-&gt;X channel has to have a balance of 1 on A side, X--&gt;Y will have to have a balance of 1 on X side, Y---&gt;B has to have a balance of 1 on Y side.
Of course, if we have this network, and B always pays to Y and never vice versa, we'll have to close/refund pretty often. Or have very large channels. But in reality, also Y will pay. Not necesserily to A but to C.
So, say we have a net where A is connected to X, B is connected to Y, C is connected to Z, D is connected to B, and there is a ring-network between X, Y and Z.
Now, let's say A pays B 1 BTC, B pays C 0.5 BTC, B pays D 0.5 BTC, C pays A 0.5 BTC.....
Let's say that the initial balance is 1:1 on the in-between X/Y/Z, A:X = 1:0, Y:B = 1:0, C:Z = 0.5:0.5 and D:X = 0.5:0.5
Transaction 1:
Transaction 2:
Transaction 3:
Transaction 4:
All of these will go through, and after the transactions, we'll have:
A:X = 0.5:0.5 (A has paid 0.5 to X),
B:Y = 0:1 (same as when he started),
C:Z = 0.5:0.5 (same as when started),
D:X = 0:1 (D has received 0.5 BTC)
X:Y = 1:1 (same as when started),
Y:Z =1:1,
Z:X = 1:1 (no transactions has gone this way).
See what we did? We routed a longer way to even out balances, instead of using the shortest route, in the 4th transaction!
This means that the intermediate nodes has a 0-sum game, while those nodes that have net spent or net gained on a channel has had their respective balances updated.
The more well-connected graph we have, the easier it gets to rebalance, but of course the initial fees to establish channels will increase. As time goes, new channels will be established to refill balance on other channels, instead of caching out status of the old channels! Because it makes sense, it increases the flexibility of the LN routing, and if you have the BTC to enable in a new channel, you'll do it instead of caching out an old channel and then create a new one.
Note: You might find minor errors in my math here, I am no machine and did this in my head :) And this is also based on *my* guesses on how this will turn out, based on fee-economics!

That is the BCH-narrative. I can't see why there should be.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:42:24
There is a blockchain transaction for the opening of the contract, yes.
The general idea is that there will be a network of these channels and your transaction can reach anyone connected to the network, which basically means that unless someone decides to create a strictly private lightning network for some reason (and I can not see a reason for that), it would mean anyone using lightning network.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:38:33
This is a problem, for sure, and is leading to higher fees for many transactions right now.
Fortunately, there is a mechanism called Schnorr, which is about signing things more effectively, that is enabled by Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:31:17
LN channels can be two way. If you receive LN transactions, you'll fill it up again. Say you send it to an exchange, does a quick trade, and later buy back, you'll use the *same* channel to transfer back, and your LN channel is again full and ready to use.

Weird. Most wallets overcharges quite a bit on  default.  It is in itself participating quite a bit to the high fees, because every wallet tries to overbid all the others even when there is room for everyone...
When doing payments to merchants, which is not all that often, I'll often overpay a bit myself. But between  accounts and for donations and such, I turn my fees way down, because often I don't care much if it goes through today or next week.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:32:53
Even though you can technically reduce block size again, it *is* a slippery slope. And you'll need consensus from the big blockers for that too.
I happen to believe the arguments about big blocks creating centralizations. All I get when I counter is that "1 GB blocks have been tested (in a lab)" and "I (who probably have a powerful computer and a fat, modern broadband link) can download larger blocks just fine. There is no problem".
Fact is, Core is thinking about world utility. They're trying to lower the bar to full participation, even for 3rd world countries. Even if they eventually were shown to have no problems, I believe it's better to err on the safe side and scale by other means than block size increase.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:48:55
Not same amount. If you mostly pay, then you will end up having to pay more to fund channels. Or, you will fund larger at a time.
Noone but you can know your transactions and how you use them. You fund your channels as you see fit. But if you get some BTC and pay some BTC, you will probably do it over lightning in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:43:39
Well. Think of it as a network. If you get a payment *to* you, your part in the channel increases. Heck, it will even make sense to route and pay fees from someone to fill up your channel to rebalance between two, instead of closing and reopening channels.
I think we'll see a lot of smart wallets doing this.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:50:36
They might be right. There might be temporal centralization, easy to route around.
The alternative, bigger block sizes, leads to permanent centralization, difficult to fix. I do know what I prefer, and it's not the permanent one.

@_date: 2017-12-02 09:10:40
I can see it went through...
There is no fixed rule as to how long a transaction is kept before It's dropped, but I th8nk the general idea is 3 weeks. If that is a problem, you can actually spend them before, with a higher fee. That will make the one that is waiting invalid. And there is other mechanisms. If it's not urgent, it's always safe 
 is a good place to get an idea what fees you need to set.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:20:54
We need to understand that the BTC vs BCH discussion is a lot more than technology. Most of the part actually trust.
Sinking to their level, we can *lose* that trust.
*Then* we are in a position to lose to BCH. Not so much now.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:33:38
Well. It's not that it's the same *amount*, it's the exact same coins. You can not spend the exact same coins twice.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:36:07
...and less than that is cleared each block right now.
Fees are high at times. Because of that, BTC doesn't work as reliably for small transactions. But for higher transactions, you can afford a higher fee.
..and of course all of this *is* being worked on. It'll scale better in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:04:59
Stupid idea. I don't think the block reward should be messed with.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:24:09
This will actually adjust itself pretty nicely.
The blocks will be spaced 10 minutes apart, as before. If there is less than 6 block per hour, the difficulty will be adjusted down so that there is again 6 blocks per hour. So if there is too little fees, the difficulty will have to be adjusted down.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:00:32
Yes. But see the stock of BCH suppoerters we have now on It's a hostile environment. Everything there actually is about destroying for BTC. Even to the point they're willing to play tricks with their own coin.
A sensible block size increase because it's shown to be needed, i.e. in addition to LN, will probably make sense down the road. And then, I am pretty sure that it will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:25:54
I think I mean "who owns what". I still think that the transfer happens with the lightning transaction, not at the point it is recorded on the blockchain. But I guess this is more or less a matter of definition :) I edited it to mean what I wanted to say.

You could. But if you mined your own for free, that means you have to turn down paying transactions from others. So why not just take paying transactions from others, and use the proceed from those for paying fees for your own transactions? It amounts to the same, really...?

The two first points are fair. But LN progress is good, latest interopatibility tests completed totally, all tests. Other simpler methods, like a hard fork? Segwit enables a lot of future things via softforks, which is a good thing imo. Others might disagree, but that is a difference of opinion.
Other coins scaling roadmaps include block size increases, mostly. Which is fair. But there is value in keeping the blocks as small is possible, because it lowers the bar for transferring the blocks, and increases the possibility of participating in mining and in running full nodes. That *is* of value.

2x *failed*. Spectacularly. Had bitcoin adopted it, it would have been major disaster.
I actually did 2 transfers yesterday. Bit high fees, but since it was with coins I had a  times 4 gains on, and since I wanted them to go through, I put moderately high fees. About $10 for each of them. And on transfers of $3-$4k each, that was perfectly acceptable.
We have seen these high fees 2 times earlier this automn. I say it's highly likely that someone is spending BTC on fees intentionally, to clog the mempool. Now, of course we *will* need to handle even that.
Next year, we have a few things to look forward to:
- Schnorr - should help *greatly* for multi-input transactions
- Lightning - will make a tremendous impact, although I don't expect it will be deployed everywhere in an instant.
- Increased segwit adoption - will also help a bit.
Most people do not *really* depend upon spending their bitcoins at this point. We want to have a good scaling solution when bitcoin goes mainstream.

Bitcoin as in BTC has a development team that is, to a fault, not willing to compromize on the decentralization principles. I am sure it *will* change PoW to "sack the miners" before letting them change something fundamental like that.

I will be first in line to start using Lightning Network. If you want, you can be second :)
I am a technology freak. I just love good technology. And Lightning seems pretty sound to me. I do especially like that there is an inherent builting anti-cheat mechanism that says if you are caught cheating, *all* the money goes to the other party. This means that it will always pay off to make a *large* fee transaction on the network that is the correct closing transaction. I expect wallets to eventually do this automatically whenever they discover a cheating transaction (i.e. one with an earlier timestamp).
That should make people honest.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:07:21
Miners can pick transactions, and obviously chooses the higher paying first 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:20:32

It is noticeable. But actually, the more noticable thing would be to start doing custom fees.
Look at  - see the colors at the top of the spikes? And see the legend on the left. Those are all from wallets that overbid other wallets - just to be sure that their transaction will be in the first block - when in reality, moving a bit down would have been just as effective!
Sure, I get it. Sometimes, being in the first block is extremely important. Then, it might make sense to pay a premium. But most times, it's simply not that important. So learn to understand how to check what fees are necessary (from the graphs), and then use custom fees!
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:33:05
I am good with todays price. I never expected it to go to 1 million dollars.

@_date: 2017-12-05 08:42:47
Coinbase sets this fee for you. Actually it pays way too much usually. But I have heard people have lately experienced a bit delay with coinbase, that has nothing to do with fees but how they manage things on their end.
You are right, it is fees for the miners. Miners will pick the highest fees first. If you overpay, you contribute to higher fees for everyone, if you set too low fee, it may actually take weeks. Bitcoin is quite a bit used, and scaling solutions are not ready because the changes necessary to start implementing the scaling solutions where delayed by people who wanted other scaling solutions...
It's a bit messy currently, but right now development of new solutions are progressing nicely. Expect them to start appearing in 2018. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:10:38
No. I mean transacting between your own channels.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:45:47
There are two ways:
1) Make more effective use of block space. Segwit is on the way, but some large players are lagging behind with implementation. This will actually help a bit, as the actual demand for transactions are probably not *that* higher than the capacity. Another improvement - that will also depend on implementation, ultimately - is Schnorr. This will help with the fee on the transactions on multisig and on those transactions with multiple inputs.
2) Lightning Network. This is like a gigantic cashing layer of a signed status of "who owns what", that any player can submit to the blockchain at any time and get *their* coins paid out. You enter it by enabling some BTC for the caching layer, and you control the spending of this BTC in the channel - the spending means statuses of who owns whom is updated.
It's a bit difficult to explain, the above was the most simplified I can do it :)
Edit:Some typos corrected.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:16:27
Look at  and see if you think this is a normal/random increase in transactions.
There are some people with a lot of BTC whose life task is making BTC unusable to be able to compete with it.
I'm not saying definitely that it's that this time. But the graph from 13UTC dec 6th and onwards looks very even and smooth upwards for me to believe this to be random transactions.
But in any ways, sooner or later it will clear. If anything, segwit should help and not slow down.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:21:56
Actually, the underrated scaling technology is Schnorr. A lot of the large fees are due to many inputs.

Bitcoin price is, like all other assets, decided by what people want to pay for it.
We trust USD because at the end of the day, we trust that tomorrow we'll get roughly the same amount of food on the table as the day before.

Bitcoin isn't much different. Price is determined by what people believe others will pay for it tomorrow.

Sure. A lot. When you initiate a transaction, you send *your half* of a time-limited promise to a payment. The other half? That is provided by the destination Your half is forwarded all the way to the destination - who provides *his half* to the node just before the destination. Now, the second node in the destination has actually paid, but he also has both parts of the payment, and that is enough to settle on the blockchain if he has to. He will of course rather keep channels open, because closing them and opening new ones cost on-chain money - so he forwards the destination half of the "payment" to the destination of you. As this proof of payment is forwarded towards you (the payer), the channel partners negotiate and signs ready-to-spend transactions that lets them spend their part of the channel on-chain, if necessary.
When this half of the proof reaches you, who has paid the transaction, all of the channel balances has settled, and the payment is fully done.
Now, this was a "simplified" explanation, but it's the simplest I can make it. The short is: No intermediate node can run away with your payment, he won't actually get anything unless he can prove that the transaction is paid in full to the destination node.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:35:43

Ok. This is simply block variation. It needs a block to happen, and sometimes it does actually take more than 10 minutes between each block. There will now be further confirmations with each block. It's actually pretty safe to spend it after 1 confirmation, so you can consider it to have happened. Some people and some wallets wants to wait a bit more though. And some things, like block rewards, needs more transactions.

It's difficult to use it for microtransactions. I have this automn spent bitcoins for some purchases - bitcoins that I bought for a smaller price earlier. The economically sensible thing for me to do, would of course to have used fiat - and I expect that is what most people do.
I have a target in not too long, where I'll sell off part of my profit - in effect taking out half my fiat investment. Should we by magic double again before summer, I will do the same again, *and* be left with only profit invested. I will then be spending of the profit from the same "lot" regularly, allowing me to have more fun during vacations etc - while I for the foreseeable future have most of my bitcoins in a "long term savings account".
Of course I will spend some profit now. I don't need to die rich ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:34:03
Sort of. It's better to think of it as a caching layer of unsubmitted transactions, where transactions in the cache could be aggregated highly so that they have much less footprint on-chain.

I will give you as neutral description as I am able to :) Note: I am still biased, I will just try to suppress it.
The developers of bitcoin currently are very much against unneccesary block size increases, because it does make handling blocks more expensive in bandwidth. This might make it a disadvantage not to run nodes (which businesses and even some private people might need/like) and mining in a very-well connected data center. This in turn will concentrate bitcoin infrastructure  to the most well-connected data centers, and making it less decentralized. Now, there exists arguments for/against this, but fact is: current BTC developers are against unneccesary block size increases.
For a few years, there has been a very strong demand for block size increases, while other solutions, like Segwit (that isn't that much an improvement in itself but it enables a lot of potential scaling) has been blocked. There have been numerous attempts at forks with larger block sizes.
Bitcoin Cash is the latest one. It's being pushed a lot by a business man without much technical knowledge, Roger Ver. Supporters are also very vocal, and will constantly say that "Bitcoin Cash is closer to satoshis vision", thus some BCH people will lay a claim to the Bitcoin name.
On BTC, currently segwit is implemented, but due to large echanges not having implemented it, and partly because of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) spread by the large-block camps, it has not seen a lot of traction. It would in itself help a little bit, although not *all* that much, on scaling issues.
The things Segwit enables arenotably:
- Lightning Network - which can be seen as a caching layer for bitcoin
- Schnorr - which is more effective signatures (making some transactions much smaller, and thus cheaper)
Now, LN network isn't that easy to implement, much harder than a simple block size increase, but wide deployment has the potential to scale much better while keeping the blocks smaller than without. Some block size scaling will probably need to happen at some time anyway, but maybe not yet.
The large block supporters find LN difficult to understand and spreads doubt about safety etc. While it is more complex, there are still a lot of safety mechanisms in it - but they have a point, block size increase is easier.
Personally, I feel:
- We will need LN or similar mechanisms anyhow, we don't want to end up with only a few "bitcoin data centers".
- BCH camp is too focused on "winning it all", spreading FUD. It is simply based on the war against BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:03:39
You can and probably will have more channels eventually. And remember, you can always rebalance, for an LN fee.
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:50:43
Lightning is important. Layer two is the only way to do relatively small, instant ecommerce payments - and microtransactions - in the future. Right now, Lightning Network is the best we have.  
The alternative, raising block size, has too many negative effects, and it would probably not do all that good, either. There will always be demand for space on the most secure POW blockchain in the world, so we need to build for the case where that space costs money, and optimize around using that block space smart.  
The important scaling we need to do, is:  
1) Make transactions use less space. See for example Schnorr.  
2) Take transactions that doesn't need the full on-chain security away from the main blockchain. See side chains, Lightning Network and other such solutions.  
Lightning Network is performing nicely, but I guess the "throw more money into ligjhtning to show support" phase is stagnating. People that use Lightning Network does so without much fanfare.   
I myself have gotten past both my first cup of coffee and my first beer with Lightning Network, but we're still early. Some security feature still need to arrive before anyone is willing to recommend it to the general public, but we're slowly getting there.  
The stats on 1ml doesn't say very much, especially since mobile wallets are now starting to mature, so people will often use them more for their regular Lightning Network usage. Mobile wallets normally create private channels, and those doesn't show up on 1ml - thus the numbers might lie a bit.

It is cheaper than other transactions, in that in each transaction will be smaller.
But sorry: at the end if the day 51 sat/b does not get you very far at this point. There is likely a combination of FUD induced transactions and spam that drives up the fees.

Mining rate is fine, that is not the problem. Problem is, we need to stop using the blockchain for all routine and small transaction. Aggregation. This is what Lightning Network is about.
The "simple" solution is to increase the size of the blocks, but: We want to keep the blocks small, because then they are easy to transfer and easy to verify. If this takes longer than a few seconds, it will be a serious disadvantage, there are risks of  double-spends because nodes doesn't have the updated status (that will of course be resolved, but it's a nuisance, and other things).
This is the reason those who wants big blocks generally want to limit the number of nodes. But: This is *centralization*. With unlimited blocks, you'd eventually end up with a very centralized - and thus, *censorable*, infrastructure. What's to stop a governement to walk into the "bitcoin data center" to just halt everything? The more we centralize resources, the more at risk are bitcoins security.
This is the reason blocks are still small. It may be that we err on the safe side, that a doubling would be ok. But the safety in distribution *matters* quite a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:40:17
Problem with hard forks is really that as the ecosystem grows, it's going to be increasingly difficult to execute as the ecosystem grows. If we can do it through softforks that is at least minimally backwards compatible and does not totally break old clients (at least functionality wise), it will be more possible to execute.
But as for clear and open communication, and owning up to mistakes, I couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:22:24
Nope. We don't need to sink to that level ever.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:30:51
There are scaling solutions on the way.
The "easy" way out would be to increase the block size, but that makes it more difficult, more expensive to mine and to run full nodes. This again leads to less decentralization and thereby, less censorship-resistance - so it's something the BTC developers are trying to avoid, while the BCH community seems to not care about those issues.
The scaling that BTC will get can be summarized thus.
- Segwit - is a small block size increase in itself, but fixes a few things to enable other solutions that will help scaling.
- Schnorr - will make "complex" transactions, those with a lot of inputs, a lot cheaper, because you can sign all inputs with just one signature. Number of inputs doesn't really have anything to do with amount of money, but if you actually start using bitcoin, transfer in&amp;out, you will gather small "pieces of bitcoins" in your wallet, and if you pay, you might need to use more than one of those.
- Lightning Network - will use an advanced mechanism called a "smart contract" to open a payment channel. Basically, you dedicate part of what you have in your wallet in a channel between you and another party.Then you just update (with signatures, making it safe) the status of who owns what of the bitcoins in that channel. All these updates does not need to be done on channel, but all of these updates will lead to a transaction being made ready, that either of the parties in the channel can submit, and the amount each is owed from the channel is returned to the respective owners. The "network part" is that when you pay, your bitcoin can traverse more than one such channel, so you don't need a channel for every person you pay to :) This is the part that the BCH community doesn't like, because they believe it's not true bitcoin - but in fact it uses bitcoin mechanisms just as much as normal payments. It can also be a bit hard to understand, increasing the block size is much easier to understand.
In short - there are scaling mechanisms being made, it's just a little more complex than just increasing the block size, because increasing the block size takes away parts of the things that are inherent in bitcoin.

Electrum has RBF support. Did you enable it?
If you are in a hurry, you *should* do that as a precation, currently. It'll make it possible to increase the fee if you are unlucky.
Other than that, I guess it might go through tonight if you are lucky.

Per now, it's mainly fees. BUt please note: Not only yours, you will also make room for other transactions.
But in the future, segwit will be a necessity for lightning - which will be instant, low-fee transactions. Your wallet will need to support it, though, so you risk having to move the coins again if you need to move something to another wallet.
Personally, I moved the coins, but not at a premium fee. I waited for a low-fee period.

It was a bit on the low side, but my guess is it will confirm at last in the weekend. Barring any unexpected spike in transactions.

There is no way in hell I can tell if it's going to go to 30k and then dip to 25k or dip to 11k first.
So I do the best I can: I hold, because I'm pretty sure we'll hit 19k and above again :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:19:18
Of course it doesn't make sense to create a LN channel for only one transaction. But remember, you can have someone fill up that channel again by paying to it.
Noone is saying all transactions will be LN transactions - but once enough of them are, then other transactions might not be so expensive either.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:39:53
Neither am I. I set up my LND node last weekend. Not done much but playing for my own fun, yet, but I hope to get there :)

@_date: 2017-12-16 11:18:21
Years, not really. Month? Maybe.
I'd wait and see until tomorrow sometime, how low we are. Fees usually go down during weekend, and are on their way down now.
Look at 
Right now, I'd not be worried at all setting somewhere between 70 and 100 sat/b, but I believe it's possible we'll go below that too during the weekend.

To be honest, we risk to have a bit of centralization on this layer too. But it's very easy to route around *this* centralization, and *much* easier to fix. Remember that the cost of running a lightning node will not be all that great.
If your core layer is centralized, you are in a much worse position. You would much rather have a temporal and practial-reason centralization of lightning, that can be routed around, than having a centralized core layer that are difficult to fix.

I think we will see people using Lightning on main net in 2018 - as in for other things than tests. Maybe not in a "large and official" way, but I think it's bound to happen. And if that happens, I'm likely to join it.
There's your adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:39:40
We'll see lots of differet possibilities here. This depends on wallet implementations. Some will focus on making the user have as much control as possible, some will try to simplify things to the max for users.

111 sat/b is likely to go through. It's really not far at all down to the 70-100 sat/b range, it's just that at the current tx load, we're not really going down, it's about stable. But we were eating into the 70-100 range yesterday, and it's likely to happen again soonish.

Then it's an issue in your setup still
@_date: 2018-09-11 21:02:26
ELI5: LN is not finished. It's still useful with limitations, but:
- Backup is not possible for some implementations. This will of course get better. If you mess up, you *may* lose your channel balance, because at least in LND, the seed will only give the non-channel-balance funds.
- Routing will get better over time. Actually, improving payment routing will be a priority in LND once 0.5 soon is released (or so I have heard)
- Interoperability could be better, but it is also improving.
In short: There is work to be done, but if you want to, you can use it today. For real goods. I have bought coffee with it, in an actual coffee place, while on vacation. Lots of people use it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:38:22
It will be "normal" fees, but you don't need to pay for express service if you don't need it.
I'd recommend learning to read  and decide how much you need the transaction to go through fast.
Generally: 
- Fees are higher between 12 UTC and 24 UTC. Decreases otherwise.
- One hours ago, fees with &lt;10 sat/byte went through fine. Right now, it is increasing a bit, but *might* go down again in not too long. If you are willing to wait a bit, you might take that chance.
- Does your wallet support RBF? In that case, you can just send a transaction with RBF enabled, so that you can increase the fee if it gets stuck. This lowers the risk.
- A transaction that is stuck is not lost. It will either go through or come back to you - but come back to you *might* take a month in the worst case. There is no hard rule about when a transaction is dropped from the queue, though, so it can be a bit unpredictable.
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:14:51
The gateway is called BTCpay. It does not have fiat integration. My guess is that we really need splicing and/or a major exchange or two to adopt LN to make that happen.

Things are being done. Bitcoin is not good for microtransaction right now. There is technology that will try to solve this. It's not finished developed, although progress is picking up I think. Look up Lightning Network. When that is ready, look forward to cheap and instant microtransactions

Real-life theory about todays dip:
Christmas is coming. Instead of following the market, trying to watch out for the expected correction - they realized their gains before christmas? Saves them some peace of mind for a less stressful holiday season?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:13:17
Nothing happens. Is it urgent?
Please note: The transaction hasn't actually happened. It's just in the mempool, the queue to make it happen so to say. They coins is still in your wallet - it's just that most wallets consider them spent.
As for the actual fee: It's not that low. If it's not an urgent transaction, I'd give it a day or two and see how it goes. Christmas should also help a lot, I believe, if it gets stuck for so long :)
I belive most nodes will toss it out after two weeks, although sometimes you risk that it gets resubmitted by other nodes. Technically, if your wallet allows it, you can always still spend the coins for something else. Then the original transaction will simply fail.
Edit: Checking  I can see that the 200-300 sat/b segment was cleared before midnight but started increasing again after that.
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:21:54
Depends what you want? Just send some transactions? Look at  what u/dmar198 wrote.
Want a more advanced node? You'll need to do some more work currently, but lots of newbies do it.

Your coins is as safe as if they were still in your wallet. They actually is. If you are transferring to yourself, don't worry too much. Unless you need them quickly. There are ways to try to speed up if It's urgent, but if it is not, keep calm.

I bought most of my BTC at an insanely high price, around USD $4400 per coin. We were up like several 100% in a month. A month later, it was down below $3k.

There are some nasty malware going around that runs on users computers and looks for Bitcoin addresses that are pasted...and replaces them with their own.
Same was actually rampant in netbanking industry a couple of years ago. This is why my bank now requires me to sign and confirm every payment on a second channel.
A hardware wallet will do much the same. Get one if you are handling more than pocket money in BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:22:08
There are no transactons that have been sent from that address.
Do as the others have suggested, first back up your wallet.dat. That is where your secret key is, which is eventually where the keys to your control is.
Next is to never take any advice that you don't totally understand. Not even this one, please verify that even my answer makes sense to you :)
Now, there are options in bitcoin core to rescan a wallet, to reindex, etc. I don't have the details here, but I did it myself to rescue some fractions on a bitcoin from a core wallet I had from then. You'll have to get the core node to have blocks to a time past your bitcoins being there, that is after 2011-06-15 19:24:23. Then you should be able to send the transaction somewhere.
And please be careful with fees. Don't overpay, but even if it's not dangerous (the coins will always be yours), there's no use in underpaying either.

More secure? Not so much.
Cheaper? Sure.
Faster? Well, depends. But yes, given that there are block times less than 10 minutes I guess that is also true.
People that consider "cheap and fast" as the real product, have not understood very much.
As a user, I am literally bombarded by people wanting to give me *free* credit cards where they *pay* me (cashback!) to do "instant transacions" via them. Sure, I get it. Credit cards are not uncensorable.
This leads us to the *real* product of crypto. Decentralisation, uncensorability and validatability. Cheap and fast is a bonus, and it's something we can solve in second layers etc.
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:31:57
I tried this with a small sum. I had looked at BCH and the predictable range 0.10 to 0.15 BTC for a long time. Decided I'd try a couple of "buy at 0.11, sell at 0.14" to keep it safe.
Well. Today BCH is around 0.85 BTC. Things are predictable until they are not anymore.
Lesson learned, luckily with only small sum of money. I ended up selling at a loss because I can now easily see it going even lower.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:51:20

Mass adoption will never happen over night. There is also likely to be services that will do this for you (as the sender) - maybe even with no extra transactions?

We actually need more segwit adoption. Yes, I am looking at the large exchanges.
A lot could be done if for example coinbase also batched transactions a bit. Most people can afford to wait 5 minutes more for their BTC to arrive.
@_date: 2018-09-19 13:44:40
I'd compile new bitcoind (or download if you have a trustable source). Then you stop LND, stop bitcoind, replace binary, start bitcoind (and let it finish starting), then starting LND again.
You have a full minimum 24 hour safety window before anyone can possibly steal your coins, and they'd have to sort of know beforehand that this would be possible....I'd not worry about that scenario.
Channels survives restarts, power outages etc. No need to be overly worried over this procecure.
I upgrade my LND almost daily, because I like to keep up to date from master repository. Although I must admit that is probably living on the bleeding edge, there is a chance I'll run into bugs that way. It's probably safer to stay on releases.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:19:26
BCH has whopping 1/10 if BTCs transaction amount.
They seldom even fill BTC block size. They make posts on reddit every time there is a large block.

I don't know hashflare. I guess it depends on if you have a proper wallet that is yours and not "shared". And surely you can contact hashflare if the transaction confirms and is not credited you, because they will have gotten it.

LN is still early tech. It's concievable that getting incoming liquidity will become a lot easier.
What if lightningspin had offered you an option, "do you want me to create a channel to pay you?"
What if you could go to an incoming liquidity provider, have it create an invoice that you submitted to lightningspin, and automatically create an incoming channel for that? In case lightningspin doesn't want to create so many channels.
What if above service gets a standard API, so that a service like lightningspin might do that automatically?
We're still early in the tech. Right now, we are building the foundation. There will have to be lot of usability built upon LN.
I still believe it's completely necessary with off-chain services like LN to be able to scale to a meaningful level of adoption *without creating more centralization pressure*.
Read  for an explanation of why I believe that.
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:19:47
Your BTC wallet is safe. Lightning Network is completely optional.
Lightning Network is still not out of beta, and to be honest I'd not trust all that much money to it yet. If you have a need for it, though, use it! Just don't put your life savings in it yet!
Lightning Network is:
- A way to allow instant payments withouts having to rely on inherently unsafe 0-conf.
- A way to lower fees, if you have payments that *can* be made on LN (i.e. your vendors/friends supports LN). One on-chain transaction can be used to do several LN transactions, lowering fees per transaction.
- A way to allow more economic activity to happen with lower number of on-chain transactions, so it's a way of scaling  bitcoin.
- A way to make your transactions/purchases less dependent upon the mempool at the time on transactions, because you can open channels during low-fee times and your LN transactions will not be affected by the mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:01:09
Freezing funds? I call it enabling.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:06:59

LN development is actually progressing well. It's just that it *is* A more difficult change than a mere block size increase.
I am not going to repeat all arguments here, but I still believe it to be a better solution in the long run.
And btw: read up on developing computer software. More money on the problem does not necessarily get things done faster :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:21:12
They are already able to track it to a large degree. They will just have to see the entry point from fiat to you. And vice versa. Everything else is recorded on the block chain.
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:24:01
Oh, sure. I am not saying it is  impossible to get through for 1-2 sat/b. But I *am* saying it's probably not going to be a scaling goal, before keeping the chain decentralized and *validatable* for normal people.
I rarely pay more than 1-2 sat/b myself, but sometimes I have to accept that my transactions will wait for a couple of hours.
For instant transactions, there will be LN for smaller transactions, and "just pay a large enough fee" for the larger ones.
If your transaction is $10k, you're not going to care too much that your transaction costs $10.

Depending on your definition on finished. You can use the funds in the LN channel. Most people probably would. There's no sense in closing a channel before it's out of funds, really? Or if you're a business and need to do it for some accounting reasons or such.
If you need to use those funds for an on-chain (non-LN) transaction, you'd need to close the channel. I think that in the start, people will commit only a little funds to LN, but as LN is getting accepted, the need for on-chain non-LN transactions will drop, and people will commit more to LN.
@_date: 2018-09-07 15:31:43
Both of it. The fact that it can be used will bring people to buy it. People buying it brings price up. People buying it not to use it but to invest also brings price up.
Personally I do it all. I have some long term BTC which I won't touch until it can buy me my moon, I have some short term savings that might bring me a more exciting vacation  next year, and I have BTC to spend every day.
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:57:10
Sure, noone is saying LN is perfect, or the solution for *everything*.
It's however a very large part of the solution to "small and instant payments", especially when it comes to on-line commerce.
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:58:12
1) Hopefully.
What you need to understand, is that Bitcoin development will *not* scale beyond it's technical limitations - and here, I mean technical limitatiton in strict sense. Bitcoin is first and foremost a decentralized, non-censorable currency. If we don't retain those properties, mass adoption is worthless. We may scale on-chain when there is consensus for it. All the previous efforts have been "takeover attempts", actually. Someone that wants to force *their* consensus on the coin. That is not how consensus in bitcoin works. It does, however, work that way on a few "competing" coins.
2) I think that if exchanges start to support LN, users will prefer to buy over LN instead of on-chain. In that regard, it might be possible for users to almost never touch main chain. I don't see any bad in this, I doubt we'll ever get to the point where there is *too little* usage of the main chain. Remember: LN channels are funded and secured by on-chain funds all the way. All the LN channels are made up by pre-signed, ready-to-spend multisig transactions. It's basically 0-conf that are so secure that you don't need to submit them at all, unless you need the funds elsewhere.

I don't understand why we compare a second layer technology with the base layer at all.
LN will be as decentralized as the users of it make it, they create the channels they need. The same can not be said of the mining, there they are totally dependent upon the base layer properties.

There are fundamental differences. In Xapo, you have *given* them your bitcoin in return from them promising that they'll sell it at fair market price so that you can spend them in fiat.
In the second, you have entered a bitcoin smart contract essentially creating an unsigned transaction with two inputs and two outputs, with As funds going back to A and Bs funds going back to B. No transfer of money has happened, noone can *steal* any money at this point. And if they don't fulfill the obligation, all money will be returned automatically. There will be no need for anyone to comply, they have already done so.
Lets say this smart contracts is for A putting in 0.5 BTC and B putting in 0.5 BTC.
Now, on the first LN transaction, says A pays B 0.1 bitcoin, this payout transaction is updated. It now says A gets 0.4 bitcoins and B gets 0.6 bitcoins. This is all signed, and *both* parties can at any time submit this one.
Now, there are mechanisms in place that basically makes it very hard to cheat, i.e. by publishing an old status. This anti-cheat mechanism states that publishing an outdated status gives the other person all the funds.
All this is controlled by Bitcoin transactions - even though they are aggregated. There is no money kept by a third party.

It'll not be much used by regular people, working their ass off for next to nothing. What it *might*, is enable some people with a bit of initiative to get a second income. At least if they have an internet connection.
Let's say you are good at something. Like, writing short stories. Or translating between Swahili and English. With bitcoin, you could easily set up an online business, where people pay you with BTC for your work. Doing international bank payments is cumbersome and expensive, bitcoin would be easier in this case.
2nd: In many 3rd world countries, we see quite a bit of inflation. If you are able to put aside a *little* money to buy bitcoin, you can get some money out of this inflation loop, and will be a bit better off for it.
But you are right. You need some sort of internet connection. But to just use it, you don't need much of an internet connection, at least a tiny line now and then.

I live in a social democracy called Norway. Everyone have a right to food on the table and  necessary healthcare here. And yes, necessary health care paid for by *my* money. It might not always be the best in the world, but It's pretty good.
Public transport exists and is decent, even some places where it is not really profitable. Subsidized with my tax money.
I have a masters degree in computing, that I essentially got for free. Minus living expenses and study materials for the studies. My student loan is paid off, and my parents were not rich. They didn't have to pay a cent of it. I got by on my student loan. These student loans are also pretty decent, if something happens and you can not work, you won't actually have to pay it before you have a job.
My country also try to help out others that are less fortunate than me. For my tax money.
I pay my taxes gladly. And I usually give a bit myself to charities. I am born lucky by being born in Norway. Even if I pay quite a bit I  taxes, it gives me a security net others dream of.
I will do my taxes on my bitcoins too. Even if I doubt that Norway would actually have caught me cheating.

Exchanges usually does not let people have much choice. Wallets is when you control your bitcoins yourself. When they are in an exchange, they are in control. If they go broke, you might lose your bitcoins. Banks will have consumer protections for this, exchanges not. Some have an insurance that will protect you to some extent. 
But with Bitcoin, It's not best practise to keep your coins at an exchange. However, before you move them to your own wallet, you need to understand the implications. It means you are in control and totally responsible for security. You may lose your coins if you do a mistake :)

I've had the pleasure of discussing with u/luke-jr before.
In my opinion, one of the - perhaps the most - important features of bitcoin is that you *can* validate it. All of it. The value-proposition of bitcoin is thus reduced the harder it is to validate it. If it were allowed to grow unlimited, with low fees, I can easily see this validatibility becoming "a myth" for ordinary people. Without this validatibility, the reason to actually trust bitcoin disappear.
u/luke-jr might comment himself, but *his* view is that it's not enough that people *can* validate it, for bitcoin to be truly decentralized, a large majority have to *actually* choose that. He defined the large majority to be 85%. This is where the 300kb block size comes from, because that is his estimation of a "pain point" for ordinary people.
I see where he's coming from, but I don't think we can actually reduce it to 300 kb, realistically. But we *do* have to be aware of the problem, and not make it escalate beyond any hope of control.
As a side point: Look at the recent bug. *If* things like that occur, we *do* want it to be possible for those who find reason to distrust bitcoin to go back to the genesis block and just verify it all again, within reasonable time.

LN has 3 interoperatible open source implementations per now.
There is no "secondary" chain. What happens is simply:
- There is a multisig/smart contract that guarantees the channel, recorded on the blockchain.
- All transactions are in form of updating a mutually signed closing statement of the channel status that is not yet recorded on the blockchain.
- Game theory makes it prohibitely expensive to cheat, i.e. publishing an old status. Publishing an old status and get caught will make you *lose* all your balance in the channel, and publishing the closing of a channel without this being signed off by your party will make you have to wait for a long grace period. Not only the other party but also other "watching nodes" will be able and incentivized to catch any attempt at fraud.
Miners will be motivized to fix the current situation just as they are now. We pay them for the on-chain transactions. Difference is, we're not going to jam more transactions down their throat than they can handle.
I agree that we risk an element of centralization, but it will be one that is easy to route around, as opposed to one that is impossible to route around if there is centralization on the base layer.

This is pretty difficult to do math on. It all depends on how fast this is included in wallets and/or people migrate to wallets that supports it.
And that is exactly why it's so important for supporters of other coins to ridicule LN. They know that if it scales, their value as a fast transaction mechanism suddenly drops.

No. I believe that a business that has those requirements will not have lightning channels directly with its customers but with nodes.

It will, in a way. The ecological disaster is usually seen as "energy consumption per transaction". With LN, we'll have lots of transactions aggregated into very few real transactions. The cost of each transaction, in energy, is thus going down.
But I think the energy consumption problem is exaggerated anyhow.

The blocks are orphaned when someone mine on old information and then mines a block. The shorter the time between blocks, the longer will the information propagation take, in percentage of time, and the greater is the chance that a block is found based on old information.
Now, as a small pool, you'll obviously want to get the blocks as fast as possible. One way to do that is to move your mining node closer to "the rest" of the mining nodes, especially the larger ones that finds blocks often. Congratulations, now that "cluster" of mining nodes will find an even greater percentage of blocks, making it even more of a disadvantage to be longer away from them.
Now, let's say it takes 5 seconds to get and validate a new block. With a 60 second block time, the "rest" of the network spend 1/12th of the average block mining time to get the old block. The node who mined the block will not have to transfer it anywhere, he already have the new information!  
  
Now, lets say that with 10 minute block interval, the blocks will grow a little larger, and we get 10 seconds to transfer and validate a block. Now, the ratio is 10/600 or just 1/60th og the time that a node spends mining on old information!  
Remember: Mining an orphaned block is waste/loss for a miner. The more of your blocks get orphaned, the less income will you get.

Right now, I guess mostly by advertising (for example here: r/ and word of mouth. If you have a store that sounds interesting, people will connect to you! There's also going to be (and we are starting to see) swap services, where you can get opened an incoming channel for a fee. 
For a larger business, this is probably a negligable cost. 
Routing nodes will also be incentivized to reach as many shops directly as possible, because it will make it a better place to connect.   
In short: No, you can't install it and expect people to pay you at once. But if you already have BTC, one way would be by creating a channel and paying outwards - for example by using r/ to get the BTC back in an onchain transaction.

The reason people flock to gold these times is because gold isn't based on anything. It's a fundamental known. This is gold, we can validate it being gold, and we know people can't just go and create more gold.  
Bitcoin has a of the same properties. It can be validated to be bitcoin, it is guaranteed to be scarce. Noone can't just go and create the double amount of bitcoin.  
It remains to prove it's trustewothiness in this regard. The validatibility is a \*very\* crucial point, and one that those that advocates reducing validatiblity (increasing block size) ignores.

The best I can find right now is this: [
We already got 4 MB max, with Segwit. In reality, maybe a bit more is "safe". But this isn't a question of absolutes, in fact every block space increase does
\- increase the cost of operating a full node, something  miners need to do as well as those with a significant economic actions on the chain \*should\* do.
\- increases the latency, the time it takes from a block is mined until the rest of the miners have the same information that the one who mined the block has. This equals  centralization incentives - because the more blocks you find, the more time to you have this advantage. If this advantage is 5 seconds, it can be neglible - if it's 20 seconds - not so much! 20 seconds is actually 1/18, or more than 5% more profitable to be in the pool that mined the last block, so any miner would of course join the pool that finds the most blocks!

This doesn't inspire confidence with him, I guess.  
We shouldn't lie or exagerrate safety. I will try to explain the technicalities in a way that OP can understand.  
1 confirmation makes it hard to revert. But, there \*is\* a possibility that somewhere, with some other miners, another block is found at the same time, which invalidates the first block. Then, one of the sides will end up as an orphan. It's not a given which one it will be, it depends where the next block is found first.  
Normally, however, that block would likely include the same transactions, at least approximately, and the rest of them would go in the next block. The risk that something bad happens from this is quite low. This is the reeason we usually say that 1 confirmation is safe, it's not something that can be trivially exploited and it would be costly to exploit and not worth it for small things.  
Security increases the more confirmations you have. I'd say:
\- Coffee - 0 confirmations might be safe enough.
\- Cheap things (think low-end cell phones) - 1 confirmation.
\- Computers - 2 confirmations.
The exact limits, I haven't done my calculations for. Once you have one confirmations, each next confirmation should take on average 10 minutes - but there is natural variations.

But once your bitcoins are in an exchange, you know nothing about them..
Let' s say I send you 10 BTC for safekeeping. Then 9 other people do the same. You now have 100 btc. You know that any one of us can claim our 10 btc at any time...but unless all of us do, you are good. So you sell 10 btc to cover your costs. Now, we all have 10 btc with you, you can pay 9 of us...but if all 10 ask for our btc, you are broke.
There's no way to know if exchanges do this. They might be fractional reserve without any else knowing.

Whether or not he has stepped down from Blockstream doesn't matter.  
Blockstreams relation to Bitcoin Core is a funding company. Sure, it takes some of the time from the developers they employ to work on their own projects (Liquid etc). But part of their paid time is dedicated to work on Bitcoin Core. The contracts are actually pretty specific in this regard, that their contributions to non-Blockstream projects \*are\* their own to decide on.  
As such, Blockstream doesn't really pull as many strings in regards to Bitcoin Core as someone wants you to believe. Sure, your opinions on what goes into Bitcoin Core, etc, will get influenced a bit about what other thingss you work on - that can't be avoided, I think. But all in all, Bitcoin Core developers are a distributed team. Those funded by Blockstream will have to contribute to what Blockstream makes, while those, for example, that work on MIT Digital Currency lab will likely have to contribute to research, or teaching at, MIT.

It's extremely "easy" to reduce the fee by increasing capacity. Problem is that it will destroy bitcoins unique properties if you do it too much.
Bitcoin gets its true value from being decentralized and possible to fully validate. If you increase block size, you reduce the number.of people who participate in the validation process, because CPU, disk space, bandwidth requirements increase.
Instead, it's possible to keep the main chain small and keep part of economy off the main chain:
- Lightning Network for retail/shops
- Sidechains for special purposes, trading etc.
All of these will use main chain as settlement layer.
I wrote a blog post about this the other day:

My journey was a bit shorter. I got into bitcoin in 2013/2014, but forgot/lost some interest during the bear market. My fault. Like many  I got a renewed interest last year. Like many, I came to the conclusion that this can *actually* work and by golly, even be worth real money.
Like many, I started off as a supporter of a block size increase during this period. But during the long and bitter discussions, I started to do my own research.
My first conclusion was that we need a very conservative consensus process. The problem we are trying to solve  is one of trust, and if something can be changed in a backroom deal in New York just like that, it's not going to be trusted. So even if my mind about block size increase was still not made up, I was completely sure that  NY agreement was wrong.
Block size debate was a harder nut. But in the end, this one boils down to trust.
We trust in bitcoin because we don't have to. We can validate. Once you start eroding this possibility by making validation much harder, you erode this trust. People don't validate anymore, they trust.
There was a time we trusted money. But once economy got too large, we can't validate it. It's important to keep the economy we need to validate as small as possible!
Coffee cups? Those are in LN! I can't possibly validate all of those. But LN does it for me, if I want to validate bitcoin I only need to trust that multisig addresses and the smart contracts in LN work. They are all on the blockchain.
Cryptokitties? We can accomidate that too. If we stuff them on a sidechain, we validate the sum of it, the part that is anchored to the main chain!
But if we decrease the possibility to validate the main chain, we lose.

While it's true that you can use LN for several coins, this is a serious misunderstanding.
I run an LN-node. My LN-node can only transact in bitcoin, since it's in the bitcoin mainnet.
LN need a blockchain for operation, and an LN-node currently operates on one and only one blockchain. The LN for Litecoin is separate from the LN for Bitcoin.
There's \*no\* plans - and in fact I can't see how it's ever going to be done - to run multiple coins on the same channels.  The best you can possibly achieve would be to have LN nodes that are pecial-purpose atomic swap nodes.

As crypto goes more mainstream and becomes easier to use for more people, it will mean that banks will have more competition. That is always good.
I am not sure it would *actually* be good for the world if Bitcoin became the world currency. Probably not. But I do believe in it as an alternative and transparent option.

And here's the thing: Every time you do it, you'll probably open a channel that is larger than you need. If you won't spend it with them, chances is that you can spend it through them.
If you are running an LND node, you can now also route transactions to them....but won't that eat up your liquidity? Well, sort of - but that will *gain* you liquidity in another channel! So if you don't really know where you'll spend next time, if you open a channel somewhere to spend, be a good sport to open a channel a bit larger than your immediate need.
It helps the liquidity network, and it probably helps yourself!

LN will be cheap. I will break this down for you. I will make some speculations here, I admit this.
Let's assume:
- Routing fee will be 1 satoshi per hop, as of today
- Watchtower will take 1 satoshi (not known per se, but will probably be low as the job is extremely easy, and too high fees will be outcompeted quickly).
- This is after AMP, and we'll assume that AMP-routing have the same fees as other routing, i.e. anyone that forwards something will take the same.
Now, all of this is pretty worst case assumptions imho.
Let's assume a channel size of 200k, and an average transaction size of 5000 satoshi. Larger transactions would probably lead to you creating larger channels, I think 200k is a decent size if you are planning to transact smaller transactions.
Cost to open: 5 satoshi/byte. You can plan ahead, don't need first block confirmation. I have opened a ton of channels upto now, and have never paid more than 5 sat/byte (once, that one was an accident, 2 sat/b would have been enough then too).
Let's assume you get 150k used "on average", before something happens (hard close or otherwise).
So, 170 byte * 5 = 850
150k/5000 = 30 transactions.
5 hops+3 watchtowers = 8
30 * 8 = 240
Closing? You won't, you'll top up. So that will be "next cycle".
So we end up with 1090 satoshi for 30 transactions, or 35 satoshi per transaction.
Smaller transactions means you'll get to push more transactions in before needing to top up, so smaller transactions will carry less weight from the opening fees.
I believe 35 satoshi is a quite low transaction fee. And here, I have done *a lot* of worst case assumptions. If you actually receive, you'll get money back, and you can keep your channel longer before having to top up.
For larger transactions, you might need AMP, which will mean more routing fees. But percentagewise, the fees will probably be lower percentage of the transaction, so you are still good!
LN fees won't be high. They'll be low. And especially it will make true microtransactions possible, with extremely low fees.

Also, your biggest assumption here is that block size will never increase. It will when there is consensus. Right now, consensus is that we do other optimizations first - Schnorr, MAST, infrastructure for LN and sidechains, etc. Not everything has to happen on the main chain to be part of the Bitcoin \*currency\*,

You need to run your own LN node. Currently that.means running a Bitcoin full node, but a light mode called neutrino is on its way.
It's worth noting that you can and should put the node on a different machine than the store. The store only needs minimal access rights on the LN node: generate invoices and check if it's paid.

1. No it doesn't. It probably eventually needs to trust other of the nodes to find some of the routes in the network. But it doesn't mean that it can't ask more than one of them and pick the best, and that even every node can perform this service, and it doesn't mean that it can't independently verify what those nodes are telling it.
2. Nope. It's partners, not customer/vendor. And none of those hubs can confiscate or indefinitely hold the funds. Bad Lightning Nodes *will* be routed around.
3. I have done so, *already*. I bought 4 cups of coffee travelling through Palo Alto This summer. Backyards Brew, nice place. No direct channel. It worked.
4. You are welcome to do so :) LN basics in itself isn't actually that complicated, though.
5. Atomic Multipath Payments will be here, probably before year-end in my estimate, which is based on what I hear in official LND communication channels.
6. True. But too long route to a popular destination, it means there is tremendous opportunity for someone to bypass all those intermediate hops. Too bad effect from this, and someone *will* open channels.
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:23:34
quite a lot of people do their first payment to blockstream, exhausting liquidity to it. 
Added to the fact that people open small channels currently and that LND and c-lightning still does not totally agree on safe on-chain fee reserves (leading to c-lightning force-closing channels when either too low or to high fees are proposed), this is currently not surprising.
This will get better over time, for now accept that this is part of being part of early adopters :)

I happen to agree. We are not ready for mass adoption.
We are on track, though. Lightning Network is getting better, and sidechains have the  potential to free up a lot of onchain capacity.

@_date: 2018-08-12 11:47:16
Well, there's a few solutions:
\- Shops can accept that once the transaction is submitted, it will be confirmed sooner or later. This is a risk calculation (as long as it's not in a block, there's always a chance another version of the transaction could be mined and the shop will lose the money - aka doublespend), but there are people who do it.
\- A new payment system, called Lightning Network, will alleviate a lot of this. Payments are more or less instant and shops do no longer have the doublespend risk. Fees in Lightning Network is also substantially lower, but there are tradeoffs here too. People will have to allocate funds into LN channels, and they will need to do that before they use the bitcoin to shop, because opening a channel requires an on-chain transaction. Once a channel is open, however, it can be used to pay several times, and to several vendors.

A lightning channel is simply a multisig address with a pre-made spend transaction that both parties hold - giving each a means to just cash it out.
It's true that you can not spend it offchain without the other party signing the spend transaction, but *every* operation includes signing new on-chain ready-to-submit transactions making both parties able to submit to the blockchain. It's not like you can open a channel and then you need to ask the other party to sign this transaction, signing this transaction is a *necessary* step for opening a channel. Likewise, for LN transactions, signing new spend TXes are an integral part of any transaction in a lightning channel.

I sent 1000 1millisatoshi-transactions over a direct channel. In 14 minutes, because I was lazy and scripted it with calling lncli for each invoice.  
Routed, it'd probably have been too expensive though. But I do see a trend of people lowering base\_fee and instead maybe increasing feerate, making routing small values essentially free, but larger amounts costs more.

There was insanely high fees from november to december (approximately)
Right now, the fees varies. You'll still have to pay a bit for first block confirmations at high traffic times, but currently the mempool pretty much empties every day. Which means that 1 sat/b has a very high probability of go through same day, at least.
Now, I fully well know that this won't last, necessarily. So does everyone else. 
Luckily, fees are a product of data size, not of transaction amount. This means that at the times of insane high fees, it was still very economically feasible to do moderate to high transaction and have a fee rate which wasn't too bad. The largest problem was the tendency of wallets to always overshoot by a margin in the fee estimates, leading to galloping fees.
The fee rates we have now, is a combination of wallets having gotten better in their estimates, and less number of ineconomic transactions. During the high fee periods, there was all the time a very large number of clearly systematically generated transactions that was clearly uneconomical in nature, they were more or less sending bitcoin back and forth between the same addresses.
Since it was uneconomical, and didn't really have a PR effect at all, I think it stopped for that reason. I do believe there were a number of entities trying to artificially raise the fees. We're seeing less of that today.
Other than that, small value transactions is more likely to be feasible on the Lightning Network than on-chain. You can already today try it out - there is a few useful services on it, but to be honest mostly there's proof of concept services nowadays. As a BTC owner, I took the choice around christmas that I would be among the first to be ready for production lightning when it was "recommended for production", and set out to be ready for LN at the time that LN was ready for me. I now run a Lightning node on the network, in addition to more or less accepting I'll use my Eclair wallet as my main mobile spending wallet now, since I want both Lightning and on-chain transactions.
As mentioned in another answer,  is a good site to get fee estimates. I personally like  better, it shows trends in a better way for me, but I realize that understanding the charts take a bit to get used to.

No.  
Electricity has a price. If electricity was not in surplus somewhere, it would not be sold cheaply. 
  
What bitcoin needs is not really \*electricity\* spent, it's money spent.  
PoW is protection against double spends. It basically is there to ensure that it costs more to reverse a transactions than anyone stands to gain from reversing it.  
This cost is measured in electricity. If the electricity was 10 times as expensive, we'd need only 1/10 of the electricity spent to have the same security.  
If the world could in some way agree that electricity used for bitcoin mining should cost 10 times  as much as other usage of electricity, and this price was raised in tiny increments over, say, a year or two, \*noone\* would lose anything.  
The problem is that there will always be someone who is willing to sell power cheaper than others. This is at least a semi-open market. If anything, it's a bug in the markets, not a bug in bitcoin itself. Bitcoin can survive on 1/10th of the power used, as demonstrated above.

My node has around 25 inactive channels that I now can tell the world that they're simply not there, no need to try routing through them. (this amounts to around 1/3 of my channels, actually). Probably some of them will become active again, but that's no issue, I'll just tell the world they're active.

The enforcing of the "not paying an invoice twice" should be on the sender-side, not in the network end, and in fact it is not enforced by the network. Whether or not nodes implement this yet is another thing, so it might be possible to accidentally pay an invoice twice.
Currently, you do need an invoice from the receiving end to pay. The reason for this is inherent in the protocol - no nodes on the way should know the secret that the receiver has (the preimage), in fact the *knowledge* of that secret in addition to the payment hash (that the sender has provided you with) is enough to claim the money.
So simplified, it's a bit like this. We have Charlie paying Alice through Bob and Fred.
When routing discovery is done, Charlie sends the payment hash and another packet and a destination to Bob. That packet consists of the payment hash and the packet Bob should send to Fred. Bob holds on to the payment hash (which has a timeout, btw), and sends the packet to Fred.
The packet Fred receives contains the payment hash and another packet he should send to Alice. So he holds on to the payment hash and send the packet to Alice.
Alice receives the payment hash, and sees that it corresponds to her preimage. She now has the hash and the preimage, and this is enough to *worst case* force-close the channel. She knows, however, how long she has to do this, there is a timeout on the payment hash. So she'll deliver the preimage to Fred. Now Alice and Fred is square, and Alice have gotten her money and won't have to force-close to get the money.
Fred now has the preimage and the payment hash, and can worst-case force-close the channel and get his money. However, he forwards it to Bob, and when Bob has accepted it, Fred and Bob are square and Fred has gotten the money from Bob off-chain.
Bob now has the preimage, which he sends to Alice. Alice accepts it, and she has now done the payment.
It's worth to note that it's always the receiver of money that has to *claim* money from the payer. And if the payer doesn't cooperate, it's possible to take it on-chain.
So what happens if Bob decides not to cooperate with Fred, and Fred goes on-chain? Then Bob loses money! It's the money in the channel Bob-Fred that Fred now can put on-chain. Note: This still isn't fraud, Fred can not claim *all* the money in the channel, only what Bob owes him.
What happens to Alice? Well, noone provides her with the preimage, so she hasn't paid anything. The shop, however, have gotten the money, so the shop will give her the stuff! Now, who has given the money to the shop? Bob! Because Bob didn't cooperate in time when Fred wanted to claim the money from him.
Easy, huh? It takes a while to understand it, but when you do, you do understand the geniusness in it. 
There is one piece missing in the above picture - the timelocks.
The timelocks will always be decreasing towards the receiver, because anyone who has gotten the preimage should have enough time to claim the money from the previous hop.
So Alice-&gt;Bob might have a timeout of "3", Bob-&gt;Fred might have a timeout of "2" and Fred-&gt;Charlie might have a timeout of "1". In practise, the timeouts will be a multiple of on-chain blocks.

I will first start with what's not the issue.
- The issue is not storage space. That's easy.
- The issue is not total bandwidth. Although it do have an impact and I have seen reports of people on relatively high capacity networks noticing their full nodes eating their bandwith.
So what is the issue?
The issue is *the latency* - the time it takes to transfer and to validate a block.
Mining nodes and other nodes that does not get updated world view as quickly as the others *do* have a disadvantage. They will work on outdated information, leading to orphans (when they continue mine on the old information because they have not yet gotten the new block), empty blocks (because they have only so far parsed the block headers, and can't include any transactions before they have parsed/validated the new blocks).
The orphan rate will increase with larger blocks. What can happen when a block is orphaned? Well, someone gets their 1-conf transactions reversed! It means 0-conf or 1-conf is less safe.
Empty blocks: Probably you have seen that sometimes, especially when there's short time between blocks, there will be blocks with no or very few transactions. This is because *even with high fees*, a miner will not risk someone else finding the block before he has published it. If you "solve the riddle", you want to publish the block at once! And what happens if you are not finished validating transactions in the previous block? Well, you'll mine a block without transactions!
So, why does bigger blocks lead to centralization? Because the time it takes to transfer and validate blocks starts to become a more significant part of the projected 10 minute block interval!
An example. Bob wants to get into mining. He has the choice between joining a small mining pool and a large mining pools. Large mining pools will more often be the ones having found the blocks, which means there is no delay in transfering and validating before being able to mine the next block. They have a pre-advantage on the next block. This advantage increases the longer this latency for propagating the blocks are! The larger the blocks are, the more is the advantage with being in a large mining pool!
This is at least *one* very obvious centralization pressure with larger blocks.

First, the fee for force-close is really fixed. It's a pre-meditated fee, and can't be changed unilaterally.  
Second, the time-lock doesn't start until it's mined.  
The penalty tx can actually be submitred with any fee. Remember, the person signing the penalty tx holds the key to the funds that the attacker can claim after the timelock, and the whole of this value is available for fees, if necessary. And if that's not enough (it will be if it is worth it for someone to actually try to steal from it), it \*is\* possible to CPFP.
  
The pre-negotiated fee reserve simply can not surpass that level. It'd be virtually impossible. Unless you were spending \*more\* than what you were stealing in fees to spam the network....

Are you kidding me?
Both BCH and BTC is already way too centralized, there's only a few large mining pools dominating the mining. As a new miner, you obviously want to join a profitable mining pool, and increasing the costs (bandwidth etc) does eat into the profit of the mining pool. Now, these costs are *not* proportional to the number of miners in the pool, they are fixed! Which is the reason we'll never ever see a profitable solo miner ever again. I am willing to accept that. But we don't need pressure for even *more* centralization.
And developer centralization? You probably have read that a company called Blockstream "owns" Bitcoin Core?
Here is a pretty nice breakdown of this argument. Bitcoin Core development is already pretty decentralized:
There's other node implementations run on BTC, as you can see on charts. But Core dominates, because that's the one with a large, decentralized development team and speed of innovation.
The "centralized development" is a red herring. And it is not the kind of centralization/decentralization that matters.

I nowadays try to limit myself to answer honest questions and to correct obvious factual errors. 
Especially along the roles of users/full nodes in valuing a coin \(and in last instance, providing financial as to compared to technical security\), it seems they don't actually recognize it at all. It's like a carpet goes down when I try to argue that for a mined block to be valuable, someone have to \*give\* it value.
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:58:32

BTC didn't increase blocksize previously. It actually lowered it. I think a lot of people had - and still have - the assumption that it'd grow if it was needed. I do too.
 But as Bitcoin has become increasingly popular quite fast, the realization last years among main developers in the BTC area is that the most important work is to *limit* this growth.
Noone has ever said it shouldn't grow, though. What is said is that it should grow as little as possible, and that "it's impossible to pay very small fee for next block confirmation" is *not* a good reason to increase it.
Btw, Segwit *was* actually an effective blocksize increase. People that worry about low fees has had ample time to migrate to segwit transactions by now, and it gives a healthy discount.
Other than that, there is a few other transaction optimizations in store. Schnorr, for example, will make multi-input transactions cost much less to perform than now. Segwit is the building block in much of these optimizations.

@_date: 2018-05-09 08:30:45
Oh, yes. But the *limit* has not increased during this time.
But you are correct that a block will not be larger than needed, so in the beginning the demand was very low.
Incidentally, it is more or less this growth curve that has made people come to realize that the most important thing is to limit the need for block space. 
Because Moore's law is not without limits.

In open source, beta has a somewhat other meaning than in closed source software.
There is software that has been used and depended upon for years and years without v1.0 being released.  
Beta might mean "not quite stable", but just as likely it might mean "not yet feature complete".  Different groups will have different strategies, for some a 0.4 LND might have been released as v1.0.
  
Don't put too much emphasis into a version number. For some people, LN is usable enough right now.

Infighting will eventually destroy them. Unfortunately, BTC suffers a bit in the meantime, in the eye of the uneducated.
What can be done?  
\- Be the reasonable voice. Be in if you have the stomach to it, but don't sink to their level. You will never ever manage to \*convince\* anyone of them of anything, the most you can do is educating those seeking to educate themselves. You'll not do that by trolling BCH users in \- Refute facts only. FUD is rarely refutable, except by providing good tech and good facts\-based communication. If you can, create facts\-based educational\-material, to counter their FUD\-based educational material. Facts will win in the end, else we will all lose anyways and we can all cash out in fiat and go home.  
If you find it too toxic, leave it. Go to alternative fora. Participate in positive environment. There is a ton of positive development around LN nowadays. LN needs user\-education and user\-friendliness. If you can participate there, you'll always be welcome.

Scaling to "guaranteed 1st block for a low fee" will have negative consequences. This is the reason LN is developed - to make instant, secure,  low fee transactions viable again.
BTC being pretty much the only coin that sticks to conservative and careful development to not destroy the core probperties, I accept that this is the way it is.
This is the reason I do believe in LN, and are pretty much doing much more LN transactions than onchain.
Why don't you help the vendor test LN?
@_date: 2018-08-16 10:54:57
Nope. How could it? The transaction would have to be constantly updated.
If you actaully try to use it, your partners node would of course not accept it.
What happens if your partner node hasn't seen the closing tx, and happily accepts LN transactions in the mean time?
That would then equal submitting an older balance once he finally see the tx. In short: nope. You can't. And should you manage to do it, technically, you give your channel balance to your channel partner

You know what? Segwit can push blocks up to 4 MB in size, if fully utilized, but that is the max block size we'll see with the current implementation.
There is about 1/10th of the number of transactions in BCH as compared to BTC. There is no real competition to be seen, so far.
If you do ignore the dangers with increasing block size, scaling becomes increadibly easy, though.
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:28:32
Sure you can. The third parties will have to support sending with LN of course. And your wallet will have to support receiving. Some mobile wallets (notably Eclair) doesn't yet do that, but that's likely to change in the future.

The video has a glaring bug: It assumes you have to find \*the optimal\* routing for a transaction.
  
You don't, it just has to be pretty good. Just as you don't care if you overpaid \*slightly\* for an on\-chain transaction, i.e you could have gotten away with 3 sat/b instead of 5, you wouldn't care if you paid 14 satoshi instead of 11 satoshi for an LN transaction.
@_date: 2018-08-05 13:31:49
Right now, yes. At the moment 1 sat/b goes through quickly. In reality 1 sat/b always go through sooner or later. Last months has more or less constantly seen empty mempool daily.
I recommend  to estimate what your optimal fee is. Note that if priority is not needed, payi ng a "first block" premium is often way overkill. They are mot more secure, only quicker
@_date: 2018-05-09 07:23:15
First: LN is not in alpha phase, it is in beta phase.
Second: LN is a consequence of the growing realization that one had the last years, that on-chain transactions *should pay*, because block space *do* cost money - in bandwith, storage, memory and everything. Creating a financial system where the usage does not pay for its footprint isn't good at all, and *do* resemble planned economy more than a free market.
LN is not a *scaling* solution for main blockspace per se, although hopefully people will stop expecting to be able to send small amounts for almost no money *on-chain*. It will, however, take away some load from the blockchain that is not really economical to keep on the blockcchain, but nevertheless still is there today.
Other than that, it *does* allow for instantly verified transactions on a whole other level than 0-conf. 0-conf is a calculated risk, and most of that risk is taken away in LN. Not *all*, anything that is not yet on the blockchain carries more risk than what is on the blockcchain, but it is a sensible tradeoff to allow fast and instant transactions.
 
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:16:34
It is uncommon in open source. And do bear in mind that all lightning network implementations is no further than beta at best. You'd not wait until v1.0 with an open source release.

Lightning Network is launched, but there's still work to do, still adoption to happen. It was not *finished* when it launched.
Well, in fact, no system is ever *finished* before it's dead, so that's pretty evident.
LN still needs improvement, but is usable as it is. It will become more usable with improvements, and more usability will lead to more people using it.
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:11:20
But UX is improving all the time. Have you looked at Eclair? And there's a ton of small corrections/clarification changes in LND. But LND is a command line client, and I think consensus is that command line interfaces are not beginner friendly.
The lightning-app, that lives on top of LND, isn't bad either - though it's outdated right now. Work is ongoing.
But true userfriendliness is a process, and has to come gradually. And will require end user involvement.
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:29:45
Anyone telling you that some entity in bitcoin does not need to be monitored for fraud is not to be trusted. Don't trust, validate. Also the miners need to be validated, and should there be a split due to a difference of opinion of the protocol, It's not the miners but the users that value which split has most value.
A full node is the most important tool to participate in that.
Not everyone needs to run a full node, but Bitcoin depends upon it not being prohibitively expensive to do so, do that some people will do that task.

Honestly speaking, running a watchtower won't be much in case of "work", it will be fully automated. If someone tries to cheat, he'll give me free money.
It's also a case that it's a service I myself will depend on that someone runs the same to me - so it's a zero-sum trade of services, with bonus if you catch a cheater.

Because of this: 
If they don't patent it, someone else might. The best thing one can do if one does not believe in patents but still have money and resources to file patents is to actually file patents and pledge it to open patent pools. The more patents are in open patent pools, the *less* possibilities will those who want to use patents offensively have to do so.
Patents are inherently evil, but as long as software patents exists, having patents to hit back with is the most effective defense. It's a bit like the cold war.

This is because BCH is in a pump phase before their may hard fork which is little to do about nothing.
They will raise their max block size from 40 times what they max needs to 160 times what they need.
To alleviate this, they are thinking of ways to fill up the blocks.
This is kind of opposite of BTC philosophy. They think block space should always be cheap and this is the main property of Bitcoin. BTC philosophy has so far been to rather err on the safe size.
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:40:49
There's tons of people who have been scammed. PayPal transactions are not instant as long as they are reversible. BTC transactions can't be reversed the same way. It puts the power in the hands of users instead of relying on central authorities. On the other hand, that power is a double edged sword. There's bound to be people paying crypto for services they don't get. There's no authority to appeal to to reverse your transaction.
Ultimately it boils down to freedom and power over own transactions.

Right \*now\*, having fewer and larger channels make sense, should not keep them too small. I'd say a minimum useful value is 500k satoshi - don't try to divide it up more.  
Once you have got up to around 5 channels (number made up on the spot, not based on any statistics) to various places, I think I'd increase capacity instead of number of channels, for now - because there's no Atomic Multipath Payments yet.
There's no reason to have multiple channels to the same node, really. But of course, if you later discover that your channel was too small, you might create a new one. Except: I think c-lightning at least doesn't like multiple channels with the same nodes, currently.
  
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:37:01
Almost none of it.
1\) A LN node doesn't have to know all state at the same time.
2\) A routing path found doesn't have to be optimal, just good enough. Listen from around 40 seconds and see how much of the narrative depends on the assumption that \*optimal\* routing needs to be found.  
3\) Routing can and will be improved, and not all nodes need to use the same routing discovery mechanism. This can be improved gradually as need arises.  
Modern software development tend to \*not\* wait to release a product until it is finished. It'll release as soon as there is some use case for it \- like now for LN. \* No\* software is fully tested until it is fully validated on real users. By releasing in gradual releases and not waiting until you think you have solved all problems, you make sure that the easy/early development is validated/tested, can be used, while the more long\-term challenges can be solved over time. Quite often, we'll have much more input on \*how\* to do those things after having run in production for a while.  
In my opinion, it's much easier to focus on making good technology than to make FUD\-proof ideas. Proof will be in the implementation. Most people agrees that spending time countering FUD is a waste of time.

@_date: 2017-12-26 17:29:00
But please remember: you don't need to send all coins at once. If you receive bitcoin, make sure you receive to a segwit address. That way you don't need to move it all at once.
Also, and this might be a bit tricky but possible and worth it:
Whenever you do a payment, there is going to be two outputs: First is the one you pay to, the second is the "change address", that is back to you. If you take care when sending, it might be possible to add a segwit address instead of the change address, if you add a second output address with the amount the same as what is sent to the change address. This requires that you need to be able to preview a transaction, and corrrect it/add a second output before you send.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:27:20
I'll try explain:
When you do a transaction, it is not actually done before it is mined. Miners pick the ones with highest fee first. So, if you discover that your fee was too low, you can - bitcoin-technically, at least, it might be difficult in your wallet of choice - send a new transaction with higher fee. Of course you can send one with a lower fee too, but that would be sort of pointless as that one will not be mined before after the first one....
So, what happens when the second one is mined? It is invalid, because the coins are not in that address anymore. It's simply tossed away.
Incidentally, this is also one of the reason it's detrimental with a large blocksize. A large blocksize takes longer to transfer, but it is the way that the "mined transactions" are broadcasted to all other miners and other nodes. Especially other miners would need to have that status pretty quick, because else they risk mining invalid transactions (with coins already spent by other transactions).
@_date: 2019-03-03 20:25:11
walletbalance is the onchain balance - i.e. what's on your node but not in channels, while channelbalance is the one that will change when you receive payments.
@_date: 2019-03-24 17:36:04
LN on bitcoin (they are possible on other cryptocurrencies too) is simply bitcoin in multisig addresses with pres-signed spend transactions making sure you can spend it without the cooperation of a  channel partner.  
I fail to see how it can fail spectactularly at this point, beyond fixing, I mean. But for the sake of the argument, should it do so, you'd simply close all the channels by submitting the closing transactions. Since LN is really smart contracts on the blockchain, we know it's never going to be urgent. If the blockchain is seen to be faulty, we really have much larger problems.  
There's not really anything special with segwit, either, they're bitcoin transactions with the signatures slightly moved around/rearranged. You still need to sign the transaction to spend them, just as legacy transactions. Sure, bugs \*can\* happen, but it's much more likely that those will simply be fixed, rather than segwit being reversed.  
I fail to see how any of those two scenarios are likely - barring quantum computers finally arriving, of course, and even then the danger is not as imminent as someone presume.
@_date: 2019-03-02 09:45:04
LN is not the ultimate scaling solution for BTC network, it was never meant to be.
  
It is more a realization that if you want instant, secure and low-cost transactions on-chain, you \*would\* have to have pretty much unlimited block size.  
\*No\* scaling solution will include that, which logically means that we have to do that in a smarter way, off-chain.
@_date: 2019-03-24 17:18:07
There's no automatic closing - but what you have, is that \*all\* nodes at any point have enough signatures from the channel partner to close the channel without the cooperation of the partner.

I have also bought some Amazon gift cards on bitrefill to use for paying for stuff on Amazon. It was also instant and cheap, using Lightning Network.
Sometimes I do on-chain payments too. If I need it to be instant, I pay enough in fee - as seen on  - but sometimes, neither me nor the recipient (sometimes it's the same) have no problem with it taking a day, and I will just pay 1 satoshi/byte.

1. Blockstream is a company that works on bitcoin (and cryptocurrency-related) technology. As is usual in open source, this means they have interest in bitcoin being maintained, so they do some funding on that. This also means there is some flow of information/ideas between blockstream and Core development. This is generally good.
2. I don't actually see there is much dividing issue. Most people agree that the best scaling is the one that makes sure we don't have to scale on-chain. There is probably some people thinking we should just increase to 2-4 MB already, to relieve some pressure. Then there are those that think we should reduce block size. Personally, I think we can live with the block size we have now, for a while, and work on effectivity and improvements on what we have.
3. Hard to say. I realize I may be in an LN echo chamber, but I don't really see much opposition to LN from the BTC camp.

Bitcoin does not have low-fee on-line/physical shopping as its primary use case, it can never, from a consumer-standpoint, compete with credit card.
Bitcoin transactions are:
- Non-reversable (with confirmations) - technically not correct, but correct enough :) - refund fraud *is* a thing with redit cards, but nowadays it's an accepted risk. Don't ever think the consumers aren't paying for it in one way or another.
- Non-censorable
- Not dependent upon a banking connection.
- Semi-anonymous
In addition, bitcoin in itself doesn't have the inflationary risk that all fiat comes with. We *know* that a bitcoin is a bitcoin, and we know that people can't just go and print it. With all fiat, central banks will be willing to print more to cover governement expenses, and that is a hidden tax on *all holders* of the currency.
But cheap and instant? Nope. That's not what properties we compete with.
That said, we need to get it cheap enough. But any cash-backs, if we ever wanted that, will have to come from the recipients of bitcoin itself, as there's no central entity in LN to give you that cashback.

I believe last years bullrun was a large degree of manipulation. I don't believe Bitcoins true value was ever 20k. Now, it can be discussed what true value is, but in my opinion, we have a much healthier price for the currency now. Volatility, if you remove the insane increase towards end of  last year, is super-low.
This doesn't mean I don't expect the price to rise - because I do. It's logical if we succeed and improves the BTC ecosystem. But for a currency, slow and predictable beats "bull runs" all the time.

But since we're at it. Pay me 1 satoshi bug bounty at my tipbox at  :) (tipbox isn't my code originally, but I made it more fun...)

Most of us do realize that bitcoin needs more work before it is ready for mass adoption. Mass adoption and too much hype before bitcoin is ready, is not good. You are allowed to say that it exposes problems. But it's problems we're eventually going to overcome.
@_date: 2018-10-06 09:10:40
Exactly. If we discover later that we could have increased the blocksize, we can just *do* so.
If we discover later that we should have gone the other route, there is a *lot* of vendors that have implemented their solutions based on on-chain capacity. There will be no quick "just implement LN" after we have had a lot more adoption than this...
Think LN deployment takes long now? Just watch what it would have been if we had waited 10 years....

Pretty cool, huh?  You couldn't even have done that if the tipping was onchain...

Crypto is a marathon., not a sprint.
It's unreasonable to, at this point, expect that all purchases can happen with crypto. Greg *did* say he used crypto where properly implemented.
Jimmy said that it was reasonable to use credit cards instead of paying high fees - while waiting for LN to be available where you want to use it.
But twisted words is r/btc speciality.

The problem with Segwit2X was mostly that it was a backroom deal. Bitcoin development doesn't work that way. It's an open source project, and noone at the HK meeting or on the NY meeting was authorized to speak for the development team....how could they be?
Decisions are done through creation of BIPS, PRs, peer review process. Like most open source projects. Back room deals are not Bitcoin.

Myself, I hope more for a slow and steady growth instead of these insane bull-runs.
$20k was an outlier, extreme FOMO. The prices today, I guess, is quite fair. Once the scare from the correction blows over, I hope it does *not* enter into a similar bull run.
Slow and steady. Bull-runs just creates problems.

Btw, I see I was inaccurate in my statement. 1 sat/b doesn't usually take a day, but lately, *if* we have had high fee periods, things have cleared within hours or maximum a day.
But no, I am not you - at least I was not last time I checked.

It is a small blocksize increase, but more importantly, anyone that is using a wallet that already can do Segwit are much better off with regards to getting benefit from future improvements, too.
The wallets that are holding back on segwit at this point is likely to be forever stagnant, and this is the main reason I dropped my then-favourite wallet late automn 2017. Not because I needed segwit so much, it was just a sign they had now stagnated.
Some of them are also run by people opposing the non-blocksize-increase improvements by principle, and imo they too deserve to be ignored.
@_date: 2018-10-10 12:11:09
If it was sent with far too low fee, i.e. below 1 sat/b, you might be in trouble. Now, there are ways to accelerate it, but it depends on what your wallet supports.
Also, before it's confirmed on the blockchain, it might also be possible to doublespend it.
Accepting on-chain with 0 confirmations are not safe. But if fee was &gt;1sat/b and the guy was honest in this transaction, you should be ok.
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:27:13
Bitcoin is the only one that doesn't try hard to be faster and cheaper on-chain.
Which makes it much easier to prioritize decentralization and making sure people can actually validate the chain.
Which, basically, is the two main advantages crypto has, at least coins like bitcoin. The other clones simply optimize on the wrong parameters.
That's why bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-10 10:15:04
First: We *want* adoption to happen in LN where we can. I happen to agree with this. For decentralization not to be hurt, we *need* to limit blockchain growth. There is no rational argument against this. Raising blocksize now before LN is more mature will just delay LN adoption. This "everything has to happen onchain" has to stop - and on BTC, it largely has.
Blocksize will increase when there's consensus for it. That's not likely to happen while there are still good work to be done on LN, Sidechain adoption can happen (that will take load off the mainchain for sure), and optimizations like Schnorr can help in the meantime.
Only impatient people push this stupid "world dominance, now!" agenda. It's risky, it's foolish. Careful improvements have worked so far, and it will work for the future too.
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:27:20
The problem isn't actually bitcoin. It's that entities (governements, corporations, etc) underbid each other with cheap electricity to attract business.
Some businesses that are particularly sensitive to power prices will gravitate to that. Data centers is one of them, and it's *not* only cryptocurrencies. Who is going to sit and decide what is a valuable project to provide cheap power to?
What about....
- White supremacy sites?
- Hate speech sites?
- Pink bloggers?  Those are the worst in my opinion... :)
- Porn
- Religon?
THose are all purposes that have access to the discounted power that is thrown towards data centers today.
The ironic thing is that bitcoin doesn't need cheap energy. The same security would have  been provided if the energy was bought at fair market price. It's actually the discounted price that is the bug, and 1/10th the price  will lead to 10 times the amount of power having to be used for the same security - roughly.
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:11:11
Patience is the key. There is adoption, but so far it is not mature enough for mass adoption. To claim otherwise and to push for mass adoption would be premature, and might even chase people away from LN. Those who adopt LN at this point have to understand the current limits.
I think the current adoption is fine, and enough to get good testing of the protocol in real life.
We'll see an uptake as LN matures.

Lots of times people pay over more hops. I have heard people had payments with 6 hops.  
That said, there are still routing issues, and channels temporarily have low liquidity. For this reason, it's advisable to have more than 1 channel to have more than 1 way to pay.  
Routing discovery algorithms also have possiblity for improvement. For example I am pretty sure your transaction could have taken another way if the channel directly between rompert and joltfun didn't have liquidity. Maybe your Eclair didn't try that? This is implementation specific.   
We're still a bit early, and honestly some of these issues are expected at this time.

LND v0.4.2 was released this week. It is in active use, in production. It hasn't implemented watchtowers yet, but that's one of the first priorities from now. This will also pave the way for full function mobile wallets, with receive functionality.  
There's code being commited to the LND repositiory every day. I update my node about every time I see a significant improvement. It's quick and easy, though since there's no package repositiries etc, it needs a willingness to learn git etc. Not that hard.
Of major medium\-term improvements we'll see, is Atomic Multipath Payments. This will make the liquidity problem much smaller \(not finding a large enough path\), and makes it possible to use channels with much less liquidity.
Onion Routing is of course implemented, but that has nothing to do with the "ultimate routing solution" that we'll eventually need. There's going to have to be serious work there, but not that urgent. We have time. We can even do it in steps, improve on the current and find an intermediate solution. Modern software development suggests releasing early, no need to solve \*everything\* at once. LN in its current form is usable, more development will make it \*more\* usable.  
Conclusion: LN is launched. From here, it will only become better. Do you want to sit and wait for someone to declare it's \*finished\*? Won't happen. Bitcoin isn't finished, either. No product is finished before it's dead.  
Is it beginner\-friendly? Probably not. If you are moderately interested and know your way around a command line, now is definitely the time to get involved. And if you just want to test it, download Eclair and fund it with a few 100k satoshi and a couple of channels. You'll get to see it in action, but it's more educational to run a full node like LN or c\-lightning.
Don't believe anything anyone says. You don't need to, you can see for yourself.

I agree that in the long\-term, the majority will win, but it's plain wrong to think that what non\-mining users do does not matter at all. They are an extremely valuable part of the \*incentive\* for miners to keep to the rules.  
Let's say 60&amp; of miners decide to change the rules. Let's say they're not after full destruction \- we'd be in a totally different ball game if that were so. They just want to change the rules to be more of an advantage to them. Let's say they double the block size, to give room for more tranactions. This is more or less like the Segwit2X scenario.
Now, a miner is a business. He has costs. He sells the coins \(block reward, fee\) he get to be able to pay that cost.  
If there were two competing chains, things get interesting. So let's say I run an exchange \- or sell coffee, it's the same, we're all part of the same economy. A miner sends a block that is too large to me. What will my node do? It'll reject the block. To \*me\*, it's worthless. Now, what's the value of the BTC in the block? It's what people are willing to give for it! What if miners change the rules, and \*no\* exchanges follow through? They'll not be able to sell their coins. All they can do is stash it on the blockcchain. It'd technically be valid, but if noone buys it, then it's worthless.  
Well, we still have 40&amp; honest miners. Blocks will be slow for a while, that's for sure. But they're there, they can recoup their money. Fees will probably be sky\-high, so it'll be lucrative to stay honest.  
So, what's a non\-mining full node in this? It's a very useful tool! Without it, you trust someone else to do this choice for you! They might chose the 60&amp; worthless coins, and if you were running a small business, you'd not want to sell your stuff for worthless coins?  
Now, of course \- if you are tricked in to taking the coins for goods, they aren't worthless. There's a limit how much you'll take, though, so it's not going to change things much \- \*unless\* a lot of others do as you. This is why it is important that people can run full node and indeed, that some do. They \*are\* a large part of the incentive for miners to stay honest.

Yes, you can always open new channels if you exhauts capacity in your existing channels. Moreover, functionality to add capacity in existing channels \(with on\-chain transactions \(called splicing\)\) is on the drawing board. LND also have code under development that will make it possible to send transactions via a specific route so that you can rebalance channels, but that will not help you if \*all\* funds are spent in all channels.

People sitting over lower prices waiting for even  lower is a key reason for the bear market. Buy at what price you believe it's certain to rise above, forget trying to time the bottom.

Here goes.  Wanted to play with a lightning based shop, so I set up a woocommerce.  I wouldn't call it more than  a demo shop, and only having sporadic time (and interest), I needed to make it run itself. So content all downloadable: a demo microstock photo site. All pics costs $0.10, with licensing options if you actually want to use them for something.
I also am experimenting with tipbased blogging at  The 3 smilies at the right is actually just woocommerce products you can buy. Not too much content, mostly educational LN stuff.
Was thinking of adding an incentive, like making it possible to win an Amazon gift card ☺ However here in Norway the lottery/gambling laws are stricts, so I checked and found out I'd fall under lottery laws and had to be a non commercial organization to do that. However I might add other incentives...like a discount for products in my shop part.
Honestly speaking I'd probably have more potential customers at this point implementing onchain too, but this is a store for me to play with LN :)
@_date: 2019-08-08 20:06:36
Sure. Anyone using things they don't fully understand is running a risk..
In my opinion, it's much more honest to say that 0-conf is not safe, period. An unaware vendor could also easily get doublespent without RBF, and imho if we get significant adoption  wallets doing easy double spend attempts will totally be prevalent.

It's a decent idea, but it's totally different properties than money, so I don't think it \*really\* belongs on the bitcoin blockchain.  
I don't really see how "longest chain" comes into picture for this, or what it means to wait in the mempool, or, god forbid, a double spend :)  
I think this falls into the "decent idea, but we might as well just use a centralized database for something that has a centralized authority anyways".

In my opinion, there's very few real bitcoin-maximalists. Most of them are "truslessness"-maximalists, "security"-maximalists or "validation"-maximalists.  
\*All\* the alts, without exception, is made "better" in some way by compromising on some of these values.
  
Most of us in bitcoin is unwilling to do that - at least on the mainchain. That said, on layers above (which of course are not mandatory to use, anyone can pay the required fee to use the main chain), we're fine with some compromises.
  
That is actually the whole point. If we need to compromise on some of these most important features, let's not do it on the main chain.  
That's maximalism. We believe in building a coin that's \*best\* in those areas. Capacity, cheap transactions, other things that the alts do, we'll eventually do. But not on the main chain if it decreases the core properties.

First, do you know the person? Then, he'll tell you what amunt he want *in bitcoin*, everything else is bullshit.
Second, it sounds like you're not quite sure what you're doing. There's quite a lot of scams in the crypto markets. Make sure you're not falling for one of them.
In particular: 
- If you just got a mail saying he have some pictures/movies of you doing things you don't want others to know about: Ignore them. We all get them. They're fake.
- If you are paying someone that promises to give you more back later, this is also usually a scam.
- Remember: bitcoin is non-reversible.  If you trade something with unknown people, make sure you have the money before sending the bitcoin. Paypal can be reversed, and almost all fiat-based money transfer methods can be reversed. Be careful.
And: If you're not quite sure what you're doing, it'd be a good idea to get quite sure before you do it, if you care about the money.

This is the fee that.is reserved for settling the channel onchain when your channel partner is uncooperative. It will vary based on mempool and constantly be updated. Also on some other metrics. It can go up, but it can also go down again.
Closing the channel when both parties are there is going to be cheaper as it will be calculated between the partners on the spot.

Short story:
As much as you can transfer any software into any other software by doing changes to it, it's true.
But the same can be said about BCH. They can also implement any changes they want into BCH.
Why can't anyone do it "under your feet", stealing the money in in your channels? Simple: Because it's based on smart contracts. You have as much control over the funds in your channel as your channel partners. And that's really all that matters, your funds isn't anywhere \*but\* your channels, and all interaction you do is really only with your channel partners.  
When you do a payment, you effectively put the payment in escrow, and giving your channel partner half of the puzzle to redeem it. The other half he will get when he gets the proof that it's paid to the destination. He'll have to get that by forwarding the same promise he got from me, and waiting for the promise from the other end that it's paid.  
There's really not much else to it.  
What happens if someone along the road agrees to do it differently? Simple: It's not likely to happen, because on the other end they have to provide fully backed bitcoin in the channel to you. Any "fractional reserve" would be fully on their risk, and \*noone\* elses. There are no bank bailouts in bitcoin.

It has a fair chance. It needs to become a tad better than now. ON the other hand, there are some very bright minds working on it.

@_date: 2019-08-04 09:22:34
Yes. But if you're going to go that route, ignoring bitcoins \*main\* properties, why have a blockchain at all?  
The fintechs will eat your lunch - look at for example Revolut. Cheap and fast transactions are uninteresting. We'll get there, but not by sacrificing the most important properties of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:05:31
You can, but it is and has always been unsafe to accept 0-conf transactions. There is a *reason* we actually have Proof-of-Work.
RBF doesn't really change much, but of course if you do a transaction where you want the shop to honor 0-conf, you *shoud* turn off RBF, and any shop accepting 0-conf should of course not accept 0-conf transactions with RBF - but rather wait for one confirmation if RBF is there. Fortunately, for a shop it should be fairly easy to automate this, as it is a flag in the transaction that the should could have its software check.

In the future? I take BTC on my website, via Lightning Network. The cheapest payment is currently around 130 satoshi.  
The future is already here. True microtransactions are becoming viable!  
Note: The cheapest payments I have actually routed on my LND node is a couple of satoshi. Just yesterday, there was one where I forwarded 10 satpsho. The fees, however! 1 satoshi! This is 10 percent fees!

People put more money in LN and creates larger channels.
Management options get better. LND will soon have the option to send money out one channel and into another thereby rebalancing.
Nodes get better at routing algorithms and probably at trying again without presenting a  failure to the user.
AMP will make it possible to split up payments in smaller payments and possibly use several channels.
There is tons of things that can and will be done. This is still early implementations.

First, 900 satoshi fee doesn't say anything itself, it's the satoshi \*per byte\* that matters.  
But, barring he was using a \*really\* faulty wallet, your transaction should have been mined.  
[ says there's no real backlog, mempool is emptying all the time.  
Can you see the transaction in for example 
@_date: 2019-10-22 12:07:52
Personally, I decided to lower the base fee to 500 millisatoshi, but multiply my fee\_rate by 10. This makes my fees cheaper than default up to about 50k satoshi, where my transactions start to cost more than default.
I still route larger transactions, though - but maybe not as many.
I don't believe in a free lunch. Providing a liquidity does have a cost for me, and I'd like to regain at least some of it in fees. Right now, they are still about diddly squat, though, which I guess is fine at this point. I have (with this policy) had outliers with about 100 transactions per day over some days - but I also have days without a single transaction forwarded.  
I guess the intention behind the proposal is to set it "too high" by default, but make how much to lower them up to the operator. Right now, I believe most of the network operates at too low fess. As this only really affects themselves - which is something i like in LN, your fee rate signals what \*you\* want to have to cover \*your\* costs, and nothing else.
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:04:07
That said: making a sidechain for something like this might make sense
@_date: 2019-08-07 11:41:31
I can't really remember, something like that :)
But you'll also need to change a setting in LND, setting minhtlc parameter to 1 millisatoshi. By default, it won't accept transactions below 1 satoshi.
Can be done, is not too hard, but in my opinion it's really just for the curious, so far, without too many practical implications.

Question for you: How much do you think it would actually help?  
This year, and two years down the road.
  
What do you think the effect of it would be, in the expectations about  future scaling, in the push for more effective use of blockchain, in LN adoption?  
In other words: Would it be good for bitcoin \*in the long run\* ?

It's actually not that hard. I sent 1000 1 millisatoshi transactions over an LN channel to a friend I had a channel with.
That feeling when you have just sent 1000 transactions while the balance has stayed at same value in satoshis, and then balance decreases by 1 satoshi as it should when you sent your 1000th 1 millisat-payment. I know math, but it's still magic :)

This is part of the smart contract that makes it not profitable to steal. And remember, to the protocol old this looked like rolling back to a previous channel state where he possibly had more money  in the channel. 
The smart contract says that in this case, the other user takes it all. This means that his previous channel partners got all his BTC. Given that it was 4 BTC, it was quite a few channel partners. 
He can of course try to find them, he can likely find contact points for at least some of them. They might be willing to give him back some or all of it. There is of course a record of this, at least in their nodes logs.
@_date: 2019-08-01 09:00:02
Segwit native if you can. Segwit is wrapped, the transactions from them will be slightly larger, more expensive, and will take up more space on the blockchain.  
Segwit nested, the ones that start with 3, are there for backwards-compatibility. Not every place will accept sending to a native address, it won't recognize it as a valid address format. Note that every place I have seen, have no problems \*accepting\* from native segwit addresses, it's just that the software will not validate the bc1-type address when entering the destination address.

That is true, yes. That is, if the wallet supports it. But in reality, there's no safety in anything that is only in the mempool anyways, any miner is free to pick any transaction, even transactions not submitted to the mempool.
And it's also a bit misleading to talk about \*the\* mempool. Any node has its own mempool, and timing issues, different fee policies etc can easily make it so that one set of nodes have one transaction, another have a different one, spending the same output.
RBF is, in many ways, just more honest. If a transaction has set the RBF flag, you signal to the receiver that you \*can\* replace it with a new version.
Note: there is a flag on RBF transactions, so the receiver can easily verify if the sender can use RBF or not. If RBF is set, you probably should not accept 0-conf transactions - but then again, accepting 0-conf transaction is a security tradeoff anyhow, so it's up to the receiver of the money to decide when to count the transaction as settled.
Note also that LN transactions are also quite instant, and does not have these doublespend issues at all. Most stores selling stuff where a sufficient fee would make it linger in the mempool should probably prepare to support lightning network soon.

When sending btc, there's no $ involved. The receiver, however, might \*count\* it in dollar, although this is very rare in shopping/trading systems. If a price is given in btc, then btc is what he wants.  
Now, while sending to \*yourself\*, you don't need to care about the dollar price of bitcoin at all. Bitcoin doesn't know what a dollar is, it's only we that knows what we are willing to sell a bitcoin for, in dollars.  
What you need to learn something about, though, are bicoin transaction fees. My favourite fee estimator is  [  \- it visualizes neatly the fee trends, but it doesn't tell you exactly what fee to pay. Only you can decide that.  
Most automated fee estimators greatly overestimates the required fee, in my opinion the above fee estimator is the one that gives me the best overview of how fees fluctuate over time, allowing me to decide for myself how important/urgent my transaction is.

This is a perfect use case. The second node acts as a watchtower for the first nodes channels, and the first one as a watchtower for the second nodes channel.
Note that in my example, node B didn't have a watchtower. I wouldn't really care, as an LN node operator, whether or not my channel partners run a watchtower.
And in fact, you should never inform anyone if you do, or how many you have. I think it's important that it's somewhat usual to run watchtowers, though. It's part of game theory, your channel partner should not expect to get away with fraud :)

I don't believe in putting everything into the bitcoin blockchain.
The reason? The trust in bitcoin hinges on the ability to validate it. If you make the blockchain bloated, you reduce the possibility for large segments of users.

Think of this scenario: You run a shop out of New Orleans. Suddenly, Hurricane Katrina strikes, which is an event that is known to the whole world. You take LN payments, and your node goes down as Hurricane Katrina strikes. Would someone be willing to take a bet that your LN node is not up again in a couple of days? Some might.
With watchtowers, they can't even know that noone is watching. Your watchtower could be in Australia, unaffected by Hurricane Katrina. The bet would suddenly be much more difficult.

You might be mostly correct.  
A hardfork will only be possible if it's almost s lf-evident that there's much more positive than negative consequences.  
For  a serious bug-fix, then that's a nobrainer. But there might arise other things than that.  At some point, we might have optimized things around block propagation, technology have improved so much, etc, that a block size increase is deemed safe enough (as in: won't have significant negative consequences), even. But I won't hold my breath on that one yet. And there's still tons of improvements to do on effectivizing the usage of the chain, work on that has become much easier to do now that those who only want to raise the block size went off to start their own coin.

Yes, which they already did by accepting to create a channel with you.
They can't, however, know the originator of the payment (no, they can't look it up in an explorer and see that you don't have any other channel partners, in the future we're going to see a lot more private channels that makes nodes never appear there).

The guy restored a database and force closed with old channel  states.
This should be well known to be dangerous, but obviously not well enough.
What's more, he actually had static channel backup that would likely have given him at least most of the funds,  but instead of following that thread he decided to do the biggest no-no in lightning.

Well, ok. Lightning Network is of course optional, you can choose to always pay onchain.
However, you will miss low fee instant transactions.
@_date: 2019-10-18 10:47:14
In lightning network, you have the concept of channels. Basically, you establish a smart contract on the blockchain, and then the channel have to operate within that.
But, part of the security is that you can see and prove that the other node have done something wrong. The smart contract establishes a time window for submitting a proof to the blockchain that he have commited fraud, but if you fail to do this in time, he can potentially submit an earlier balance than the latest one. Seen from the blockchain, all channel states from the start of the channel is valid, but the LN protocol creates undeniable proofs that earlier channel states are invalid, that the other party can subit to the blockchain. Anyomne that submits an old channel state not only are not able to steal the other partys money, they also lose everything they have in the channel.   
A watchtower is a way to outsource this task to someone else, you give them just enough information that they can watch for fraudulent transactions, and a mechanism to spend the outputs from that fraudulent transaction and send \*all\* of it to you.

Watchtowers will be important not because they will actually end up doing much actually enforcing anything, it will be more of a strong deterrent against fraud (publishing old channel balances).
That and neutrino will be large enables for good mobile wallets. I am not particulary fond of the new custodial type wallets like Wallet of Satoshi and Bluewallet, but this is a space where everyone takes their own choices, and it's of course going to tempt people to not have the hassle of opening the channels themselves.
LND is doing a lot to improve autopilot these days, which will make it automatically open channels for you. The upcoming mobile version of LND will likely use this.

They are free to participate, as is everyone else.  
Miners are performing a work, but they're not all-powerful. It's you and I, through accepting/validating the blocks when we accept a transaction, that deem what is \*valid\* bitcoins. If miners try doing something fishy, as issuing more coins than they are entitled to, noone will accept their blocks, and they will be wasting electricity for nothing.
We can choose to participate in this validation, by running our own full node, or we can outsource it - either partly by running SPV, or fully by keeping our bitcoins in a custodial wallet.  
Bitcoin needs to be easy enough to validate so that a large proportion of economic actors actively choose this. If not, then we are nothing more than a slightly better paypal.

segwit is part of it. With increased segwit adoption, capacity increases. Some other improvements that segwit enables, Schnorr and MAST, that has to do with more effective use of blockchain space, will also help.
The real gain, however, will be with the enabling of Lightning and other smart contracts etc. With lightning, essentially you create a contract, enforced by the blockchain, where you and a party can keep a balance of coins between you that can flow back and forth, until limit is reached or some party wants to settle it. Once the contract is recorded on the blockchain, it can be changed when both parties sign it, but settled when one of them demands it.
This is the simple explanation according to my current understanding of LN :)
@_date: 2019-02-20 12:23:19
Short answer: No.
Slightly longer answer: Never.
Explanation: There'll never ever be a way to differentiate between "stored offline for X years" and "lost". To allow reissue of presumably lost bitcoin is to allow confiscating. The can of worms it opens up is much worse than dealing with "ok, now we only have 10 bitcoins left, so we need to divide satoshi in smaller units".
Bitcoins are infinitely divisible, and what is lost should remain lost.

When I'm at 2X my entry point, I'll consider starting to spend more. I see my entry price as getting bitcoins at a discount.
Now, here's my spending strategy.
- Keep a reasonably large savings account. HODL. Unless life dictates you have to spend. Or unless you have reached your goal. My goal is a holiday flat in my favourite part of the world :)
- Keep a short-term savings account. When it goes to 2X, my spend limit will be close to half of the total. Idea is, it should increase in fiat value, but doesn't really need to increase *that* much. If you believe in the moon, you believe this will give you "free money" for years to come. If we hit a dip, HODL until it passes.
- Keep a spending account. Spend. Learn. Don't think about earnings or doublings here. Replenish if needed.

Being a beginner, I'd recommend you start playing around on the testnet.

This is actually not much different than the internet banking trojans that we saw appearing a few years ago.
That led to - at least here in Norway - all banks introduced 2FA confirmations on all payments.

There is no "inherent" price of any financial instruments.
Sure, we can agree that you can eat an apple, or live in a house. That has some inherent value.
USD does not have inherent value. It has it's value basically because someone wants in to have that value. It's a combination of what people want to pay for it and US "market manipulation" that gives USD its price.
Gold? It has some inherent value. It's used a lot in electronics. It's nice to look at so it's used in jewellery. But it's price, as a financial instrument? Has nothing to do with the inherent value.
Bitcoin is the same. It's value this much because those people who buy it for this price today believe that tomorrow (or some other day), they can sell it for more. So basically, the world agrees upon the price.
As the other comment states, this works and is no ponzi scheme because the amount of bitcoin is finite. We know how many bitcoins there is. This is perhas the key reason it is different from the (&lt;3 month) tulip craze that people like to compare it with.

I gave in and got myself a bitcoin debit card. Gonna use that on my next vacation. I have a special lot of bitcoin, bought with money set aside for future vacations, where I'll put the profit from that lot. Now, this I'll be able to repeat as long as bitcoin moves up in price, but obviously it'll not continue our current trend *forever*. My *hope* is that it'll continue  as much that I'll have gotten back the fiat from my bitcoins in  profits spent from that lot, meaning that from there on in, it's all gain.
I don't hold all that much bitcoin, though. This might come true in a year or three. I don't expect to buy much more bitcoin. Maybe some from the fiat I save when I spend from my bitcoin instead for vacation, though.
I don't expect to become "rich" from bitcoin, I see it as gotten it on a discount now. How high it'll rise before we reach a plateau, I really have no clue. And how you can spend it then, I also have no clue :)

There's no way you can lose your coins this way.
Either they get there, or they get back. Just be a little patient, right now mempool is slowly emptying. May we know what fee you used? Then we might make a guess on how long it would take.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:25:58
PArt of the answer is that they are not, part of the answer is that they are sometimes high. And part of the answer is "because bitcoin has become popular".
When you make a transaction, you are *really* setting the fee yourself. That's right. You decide the fee. However, miners also decide what transactions they will process. Of course, they will process the ones with highest fees first.
Now, many bitcoin wallets and many exchanges especially sets the fees high, because they know that else, they'd risk getting too much complaints about the bitcoins not arriving instantly. So in reality, all these wallets tend to overbid each others, even when that is *totally* unneccesary.
And then, there are times when there are just too many transactions. And there have been times this automn that certain events with another coin that has the same type/set of miners have increased in price/profits, so that almost all the miners at the same time decided to mine that coin. However, that was actually more of a problem for the other coin, so they fixed it more or less. The likelihood for that event to occur is less now.
So the answers are: Fees has come down again from the insane heights. But some wallets decides to overpay.
Last: There are cool and exiting developments under way that will make it possible to do instant low-fee transactions again. However, it's a bit complicated technology, so it will take a while until it's completely finished and well-tested enough.
Before that, there is also a lot of small improvements, however, that will help lower the fees or at least slow down fee increase :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:49:17
Now would be a good idea to move to Segwit, if you want to take advantage of the lower fees in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:16:31
I am doing that strategy. Sure, I'm giving my "spending account" a bit of a start - it's up about 60-70% now - but this is just so I don't have to go around worrying that I'll go around spending at a loss. I'm also going to not use all of it, but rather always leave enough for there to be a healthy base to grow value. So I'm hodling but also spending. Now, I was pretty specific when buying this lot that I *took* it from my "vacation and other fun" savings account. That way, I can convince myself that I'm not spending the future value, if I hadn't bought it, I'd have had to pay the double today :)
I know. I'm playing tricks with my own mind. But it's for my own good, so I'll allow it :)

There is very little movement from r/btc to r/bitcoin, the "original" was r/bitcoin.
Warning: I was not a reddit user at that moment, so what I am going to describe is only my own observations.
The history of r/bitcoin moderation is about like this:
There was a lively discussion about the block size, earlier. That in itself wasn't bad. But as consensus moved towards keeping the 1 MB block limit for now and rather try to increase capacity by other means, there was a very vocal minority that simply did not want to accept it.
Moderators was appointed to clean up spam, duplicates to make it usable for everyone.
The change of policy came about here. This is one moderator that apparently disagreed with the change:
Bitcoin XT was a client that had a lockin of enabling bigger block at a consensus level of 75%. This is way too low.
In *my* opinion, had it activated, it would have created a split - much like BCH and BSV - at a way earlier stage. Bitcoin might not have survived it.
As far as my research goes, it seems to have reached a level of about 30-something percent at times. There was of course amper temperement on both sides.
A lot of people disagree with u/theymos decision to ban promotion of it. In reality, it's not impossible it actually saved bitcoin. Although I personally would have preferred consensus being maintained by another way, i.e. by trusting that common sense would win in the end.
I believe u/theymos did not want r/bitcoin to be a tool to orchestreate a dangerous split.
We may or may not agree with current moderation policy.
Personally, I am not willing to take on the daunting task of moderating such a large forum, so I have to live with the current moderators policy if I want to stay here. As will everyone.
The rest has moved to r/btc, which is fine. I post some there, too, but it's not that often I find people there willing to discuss actual tech, without resorting to conspiracy theories.
Conclusion: Larger reddit fora will always be like this. You're damnmed if you don't moderate, you're damned if you do moderate too much. The balance is difficult.

A channel is point-to-point. You create a channel to the hub. Surely, most payments will flow from you to the hub as a customer.
But also Amazon, for example, would have to establish a channel to the hub. There, the flow will flow from the hub to amazon. Each channel has to be "funded", and when funds are spent, in essense it needs to be recreated.
Having a channel to amazon obviously needs some funds on the client side. This can not - at least not according to present knowledge - come directly from paying amazon customers continuously. But of course the *actual* payments comes from paying amazon customers, so this will not be funds continuously spent. The good news for the node is that the amazon customers would bring a lot of micro-transaction-fees in addition.
So yes, a hub would need some bitcoins to guarantee for the channels. I suppose there could be "spend only" and "spend-and-receive" channels with different costs associated. A business would of course be able to pay more fees, as they actually do with credit card transactions today. A spend-only channel will not really need much if any funds commited on the hub-side at all. But not being able to *get* LN payments might not make sense - but for some people, maybe it would? 
But of course there has to be someone to actually have receive-channels for a lightning network to make sense. And between nodes in a network, there would have to be two-way channels, well funded in both direction. This requires some passive funding, and of course some funding for the on-chain setup costs. 
Having a lot of funding would be a huge plus, this would mean that the risk of refunding a channel would go down/not happen that often.
But back to business case: There will be an actual bitcoin income that comes with lending out your funds to a lightning node. Just sitting in a hardware wallet, there is no income, it's the same bitcoins.

Personally, I do both. I have &gt;50% of my bitcoins in long-term savings. As in "to the moon". For me, moon is "pay for a flat in my favourite holiday place, with money to spare for the expenses on it".
Then, most of my rest I have in short-term savings, which I plan to grow, but spend most of the growth.
Let's say I invested 15. If it goes to 30, I'll allow myself to spend 10, leaving me with 20. Then, when it doubles again to 40, I'll allow myself to spend 15. With variants, but always leave a little of the growth all time.
Of course, I realize there might be 2-3 year long dips. Then, I simply hodl it out.
Then, I have a spending account. From this, I pay for purchases. Whenever I buy something and I can pay with bitcoin, I do it. No questions asked. Fee high? Eat it up. This is my "learning to get used to bitcoin" account. I think of the money as already spent, so it doesn't really affect me. If needed, I buy more bitcoin to fill it up. There's not all that many places right now to spend with bitcoin, and I'm no big hoarder of stuff anyhow :)
So: Hodl, but also spend.

Mark this page: 
It shows the trends in the fees, how much fees are cleared in each block lately, and what you need to pay for a likely next block confirmation. It can be a bit daunting to understand, but once you get it it's super-easy to understand what happens.
Now, notice the *tiny* high fee segments at the top? This is where most wallets of today will set the bar for next-block fee. In reality, it just contains some transactions since the last block, where a lot of people also put in transactions with a broken fee-estimation algorithm....

You are not alone in being confused.
Now, since r/bitcoin is an extremely spammed sub, with extremely cobntroversial topics, and more than a million members, there's also:
- Very strict guidelines of organization. There are "daily price" threads, "daily discussions" thread, etc, and guidelines/rules about no-duplicates, etc.
- There is some auto-moderation, that sometimes fails. A lot of those are cleared up if you just contact the moderators.
A lot of the people running to r/btc to scream *censorship* just misunderstand a lot of this. In a way, I can see what they mean, but in that regard, r/bitcoin and r/btc can function as two different venues. If you want anarchistic chaos, choose r/btc. If you want quite strict moderation that sometimes fails, but trying to maintain a useful discussion, choose r/bitcoin.
Noone thinks r/bitcoin moderation is perfect, I certainly don't. I don't agree with all decisions. But since I know none of them is paid for it, and I wouldn't either, I am in no way volounteering to take over.
Which means that I more or less accept it, imperfect as it is.

First, a raspberry pi is a \*bit\* short on hardware. You'll need good a hard disk, as much memory as you can get in a pi, and \*never\* store things that change often on the SD card.
Also, remember that few filesystems are really happy about losing power. Lots of people have gotten corrupted databases etc from running a PI, and I think a lot of that is due to bad habits and cutting it short on hardware. Remember, you need to treat it like a super-critical server, because it really is now.

coinbase has always had sky-high transaction fees that are sort of decoupled from what's actually required.

What was the "satoshis per byte" value? That's what's counts. I can give a rough guess if I know that. Right now, something in the range of 80-100 sat/byte have a fair chance of getting included soon. More than that, and it's pretty mucn guaranteed to clear.
From the amount you mentioned, I suspect your fee was much lower. I'd say a day or two more based on the assumption that bitcoin interest/movements stay somewhat high, but it would be pure speculation.
Other than that - backlogs will often get cleared during weekends.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:24:22
The thing is, for this to work you have to be pretty sure you know where the price will go.
In BTC, this is difficult. The general direction, though, is up.
This is the reason behind the old meme, just "HODL". There was this slightly drunk guy who made fun of those who traded, "knowing" all the time where the price went. While he did know one thing: Price is generally going up.
Now, past performance is not a guarantee for future performance. But most people here are in it because we believe in the future of bitcoin, and if the future is bright, BTC should go up.
Myself, I just don't bother trading. I might buy some more when the price dips, but I'll never try to time a high, selling. Chance is that I'll just end up having to buy in even higher.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:45:03

As long as it doesn't decrease into the $6k's, I'd not fuss about things. We might go a bit up, a bit down, be stagnant for weeks. General trend is good. And as long as market is positive, and BTC is on its road to market acceptance, we'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:59:51
There are low-fee periods. Usually during weekends.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:29:57
Only you can know that.
Personally, I see it like this:
Bitcoin is still in its early days. If it *really* takes off, it will have to become worth more. Of course, some of todays price is gambling on that it *will* take off, not because of todays utility.
As a store of value, all it needs to gain value is trust. There's nothing, really, that is *inherently* much worth. Dollar? Nope, it's a piece of paper or a number in a database. Gold? Nope, it's the "market cap divided by the amount of gold". Bitcoin? It's the "market cap divided by amount of bitcoin".
All we need is more people wanting bitcoin, and the price will go up.
So, to answer your question: All you need to answer to yourself, is if you believe in this or not - *and* in the timeframe you are willing to let your money be in bitcoin.
I am now talking about bitcoin as an investment. I personally also use bitcoin, wherever I can. But I don't *sell* bitcoin because I believe it'll not go higher. Nope. I believe it's value will increase? As for how much? Can't tell. Somewhere between $10k and $1M during the next 5  years :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:57:45
Good idea!
But to motivate you: If you can afford to set aside for example $500 in bitcoin for "wedding", this might actually grow in the meantime. Possibly a doubling, maybe more. Spend the gains, keep whatever $500 in bitcoins is at the time. Or, agree on a different "part" to keep.
I bought some money for vacation. Let's call it 10. If it goes to 20, I'll allow myself to spend 8 on next vacation. If it goes to 30, I'll allow myself to spend around 13. Same procedure next year. This will eventually ad up to me being able to afford that dream vacation, and still have a decent amount for vacation each year.
But the point is: First part of what you put in should not be more than you can *afford* to lose. Without losing a whole vacation :)
@_date: 2019-02-16 10:27:12
No. I used my LND node, at close to 3M sats. But once it actually stops doing LN transactions, it's pointless. Let it be while it is great, not keep it on life support

So, I think we're going to see different markets here.
There's room for both enthusiasts swapping channels for free, and liquidity providers selling liquidity to profitable businesses.
In the end, though, I guess a liquidity provider will have to provide some minimum guaranteed level of service to stay in business.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:48:05
To be fair: THe miner signaling just means that they prefer 2X. Whether or not they will mine it remains to be seen. We have some experience, though: Miners will basically not mine BCH at a loss. There are exceptions, people with deep pockets, that will do it on pure principle.
In reality, it remains to see how many people will mine against their own economic interests. It's more or less a given that mining BTC will be more profitable from the start, because the price *will* be higher and they will start on the same difficult level.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:01:42
Because that would be giving into fraud and manipulation.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:52:05
It will not unless it takes a serious blow to its security or legality. You do not want that.
*Please*, stop treating crypto as a "get rich quick" scheme. If you believe in BTC, you believe that what we have now is cheap, and just put your fiat in at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:30:43
Please note: it was a manipulation of the price of BCH that started it. It affected BTC, but not by much, really, and not for a longer duration..

If so, the new DAA would correct it pretty quickly, I believe.

@_date: 2017-11-19 16:15:45
It might take a credibility related dip, I agree. Along with all other cryptocurrencies.
But as people realize that this is by no means a problem with bitcoin in itself, but rather in how some exchanges operate, things will stabilize and we'll see growth again.
I'm not worried long term, would be worried if I had funds in crypto that I can't afford to let sit through a dip.

I Don't actually think Jihan is a fraud.. He's moderate, he tries to tone down "Bitcoin cash is bitcoin" meme. Why? Because be  is a business man. He wants two coins to compete for his hash power,  he certainly does not want to kill either of them.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:40:50
The point is: Price went up because someone needed it to be up for BCH to be profitable to mine.
This *is* an attempted attach on BTC. I doubt it'll succeed in the long run, but there is *a lot* of Bitcoin interest among newcomers this day....this can not be shown to often. We need to *prove* it, not only say it. This synchronized price/difficulty change is one data point.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:04:31
The market is speaking. This is true. But you need to educate yourself: Who is the market?
The price has increased because of large trades through a single exchange in Korea.
The price took a large spike when it was magically needed for BCH to be profitable.
This is a very limited market. I see indication of a market that is easy to manipulate to look just as good as you want it to look.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:16:38
The forkers already decided there would not be implemented choice here, by not implementing replay protection.
It is not designed to be a "choice" not to implement 2X. Do not blame non-2Xers for that.

This is a dillemma.
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:27:48
Yes, of course I am talking about the software.
And yes, we do to some extent even support them. It's  just that they are not able to validate the transactions. I must assume that anyone running non-segwit enabled nodes out there have no need to validate the transactions. There really is no other reason?
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:06:46
It's a one-time job, to transact to a segwit address. You can either do it at low-fee times, or be prepared to wait a couple of days. If you need coins to use in the meantime, you can make it a two-transaction job, keeping the rest on old non-segwit with the first one confirms.
There *are* ways to move to segwit, if you want.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:28:57
This is no different than any open source project that have grown large and successful.
- GCC fork! OOooh! The best one won in the end, it was the forked.
- Infighting! Excists in any company. Difference is, in open source, this is in the open. And people disagreeing can actually go their own way and *prove* they were right. As a society, we are likely to benefit in the long run of this possibility, a lot of things get tested that would not have been tested otherwise.
- Inflated egos!
To be sure, it can be confusing. Money will see it as huge risk. Me? I've been following open source for ages.
But since we are dealing with peoples money here, we *should* try to limit it. And we *definitely* should avoid doing dangerous things, costing people money. This is the *main* reason I am totally opposed to Segwit2X! It will cost people real money. Even if it is just those who are not careful.

@_date: 2017-11-09 13:50:22
People buy BCH now because it's a cheap hedge. I agree.
The scaling issues on Bitcoin *will* be solved. Even through block size increases if it is deemed absolutely necessary, but it's not going to be a rushed decision before effects of Segwit is fully tested 
Thank god wallet providers and exchanges can now work on real work instead of worring about Segwit2X, replay protection and stuff.
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:18:25
Si, here's the thing: if you have spent from a channel, how would you as a user want to get New BTC from an exchange? If you could withdraw directly into the channel...that'd be pretty tempting. Would you choose such an exchange ? I would.
Similarly, if a shop has got an LN transaction from a customer and needed to sell some BTC? Would they want to send them off through the same channel, ready for another customer to spend? I bet they would.
LN will be a competitive advantage, because people would prefer to empty or fill up channels, ready for the next LN transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:26:59

Bitcoin did not crash. People were massively lured to selling BTC and buy BCH, based on dubious speculations about some sort of flippening.  I believe part of it was fueled by price manipulation of Bitcoin cash.
But Bitcoin crashing is an exaggeration. It made a temporal dent in the price. Right now it is about at the place I had expected it to settle once people had moved back to alts after the segwit2x for that was cancelled. It has by no means crashed, we are about at the levels we were before the insane price increase before the segwit2x. Fees are still high, but coming down. Most of the memory pool we see are low - much lower than any wallet would recommend. Either it's spam or it is low importance transactions, either way it's no much of a problem.
@_date: 2019-02-03 14:23:14
That might seem like a good idea.
I would never use such a tool. Why? It means I submit to (and possibly) make myself dependent on *your* idea of what bitcoin is. Sure, right now we agree. But it may not stay that way forever.
Simply spoken, such licenses actually removes bitcoins permissionless and decentralized nature.

According to this one, that fee isn't *that* unreasonable:
But you should be able to get it confirmed pretty quickly still, in my guess, with a fee of 100-120 sat/byte. if you aren't concerned with speed at all, set it as low as even 30-50, but don't try to dabble into the sub-10. They were confirmed last sunday, fees of less than 5, but it's by no means a guarantee when the next period with low fees come.
In electrum, I *think* that you need to go into the advanced settings and enable manual fees.
Be warned: You can lock up your funds for a pretty long time if you set too low fees...but if I recall correct, Electrum supports RBF? (replace by fee)
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:02:01
And I just saved the price.
I sent a SEPA to my favourite exchange, pretty much guaranteeing that there will not be a dip to buy, or that it will be over within the next 24 hours.
No, I am no trader. But I will still buy coins when I believe them to be cheap. But I'll sell when it makes sense for me, never because I believe it's "the top". 
And yes: I am in the "hodl, but also use" camp. With the return I have on my "BTC for vacation and other fun" account this year, it looks like I will be able to spend more than they were bought for in august, and still retain a higher fiat value than in august...
And then there is a "hodl to the moon" account. I think the moon is when I can buy a holiday flat somewhere for not all of them :)

I'd say the best options for doing *all* transactions backed by bitcoin today is getting a bitcoin backed debit card. Of which there are numerous. Be aware of the fees involved. But it might make sense.
Personally, I have a bitcoin "short-term savings" account, that is closing in on 100% up since I put bitcoins on it in august. I plan on starting to spend from this some time next year, but not all of my gains, I want the fiat value to grow at the same time as I spend. This is entirely possible with todays healthy growth, but it might mean I have to let it linger in the account for longer times if it takes a dip. I got myself a bitcoin debit card, and barring a major crash in the price, I have some larger "fun-related" expenses already planned for march. I can afford to spend my fiat on it, but if I have good returns on my bitcoins, I'll spend from that instead.
Now, in *addition* I have most of my bitcoins in long term savings. Much like I do for my fiat, btw. I have more in long term savings than I spend.
Last, I do actually also have a bitcoin spending account. From this, I take the impulse expenses that are directly payable by bitcoin. But I don't bother with spending all my daily expenses with bitcoin debit card. I can see it making sense, actually, since bitcoin *mostly* rises in value. It might actually make your expense money reaching longer. But you'll need to do your own calculations and risk assesment :)

They are adjusting constantly. Up and down..any attack on hashrate will quickly make their difficulty go up.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:53:40
No, that is the only step. Be sure to send it to a segwit address :) I don't know Ledger, but that should hopefully be clear what is and what isn't segwit. The segwit addresses should always start with a number 3, that is an indication.
Be sure to use as low fee as you want, looking at  I can see that right now, we'll soon start eating from the 20-30 sat/byte range, but check again before you send.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:11:13
Some do now. I know it's alpha quality, but I use Samourai for my "mobile wallet", because of this. I only keep amount that I need to be able to spend soon here, though. Most is in a hardware wallet - within Segwit addresses already.
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:28:30
Because they are all mined after a plan.
Currently, there is one block every 10 minutes after the plan. Now, due to fluctuations in hash rate, this can of course vary. The variations, however, will be evened out roughly every two weeks. The difficulty of mining will then be adjusted so we again are on track for 1 block every 10th minute. Minus, of course, a little, if we have mined too much the last period, and vice versa.
Now, currently, there is exactly 12.5 bitcoins issued per new block. The rate halves every once in a while, so in 2020 this will go down to 6.25 bitcoins per block.
If you add all of this together, the reward will amount to almost nothing in year 2140, and new bitcoins will stop being issued.
By then, it is assumed that the miners will only get transaction fees for their job.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:14:53
They are, generally, considered to good to be true. Sure, you're likely to get your fiat investment back. But it's likely you're never going to get the amount that you would have had if you just bought bitoin instead.
I have a mining contract for a few months now. Did it as an experiment, didn't buy much. Close to plus in fiat, but in bitcoin? I am a bit more than halfway. And bitcoin amount will always decrease over time.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:30:44
If there was such a way, bitcoin would be seriously broken, and lose it's value. Luckily, the concept of public key/asymmetric cryptography is pretty well established and won't be broken that easily :)
So: Nope. And it's per design, so that noone but you can spend your coins.

It's not possible unless you have the private key somewhere. If you remember having written down some random words, that can also be used to reconstruct the keys.
Other than that, it is not possible. That would have invalidated all bitcoin security :)
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:27:07
But not always so ideal for phone. Personally, I keep some spending money on a wallet on my phone too - not too much. If it will become too much, I'll probably have to transfer something back. This just eases the bitcoin use - I don't take the hardware wallet with me every day or to every place I go....and somewhere, some day, you'll end up in the situation that you'll want to buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:50:46
You're in exactly the same situation as I was. In august. BTC was *insanely* high. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:59:09
It will definitely start at a lower price. Whether it goes up or down depends on the trust/acceptance it gets in the market afterwards.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:37:14
And to add to this: We might get to the future when this isn't the issue. But the issues today are real. Blockchain size costs money.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:32:24
It's only as safe as your own understandment of it.
You need to understand what a key is, why to keep the restore words safe, both from destruction, forgetfulness and prying eyes. And how to use it to restore.
You need to understand whether or not to use a pass phrase, and the implication of forgetting it (same as above)
But as long as you are aware of this, and understand that error here might mean you *lose* your bitcoins forever, it is *much* safer than an exchange. You just need to have a strategy about what to do with keys and an eventual pass phrase. And yes, this includes what happens to it if you die or get a brick in your head and forget totally all you know, including that you have bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:43:36
As much as I see the irony it (verroger.com is the real Roger Ver!), I doubt it'll controbute anything in a meaningful direction. We certainly could use a "common lies and scams" section somewhere, and lies about "XXX being the true bitcoin", or "buy bitcoin here" where you don't get bitcoin comes pretty high on what needs to be there, though.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:13:27
Where did he sign up for the account?
A satoshi is currently a small fraction of a cent. I doubt he'll be able to claim them until he has gotten several thousands of them, and then you'll perhaps get a dollar or two worh of bitcoin. It's easy to get a few satoshis "for free" a lot of places, it's called faucets. Some of them claims that once in a while, it'll even pay out larger sums. In reality, you'll quickly realize that this is likely not worth your time.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:09:41

I'll not cash out totally before I need to.
But I'll start spending some of it "pretty soon". And mind you, most of my BTC is only from august, with a 4k+ cost.
I have:
X BTC in long-term savings.
X/2 BTC in short-term savings. These, I'll spend some of my profit from, probably already this winter - but never more than allowing some growth in fiat over time. If BTC growth flattens out, my dream is that I'll have used my initial investment from my first and second account, in fiat, from this account. Which means from there on out, it's *all* profit. It might happen already this year.
X/4 BTC in spending account. To be used at will.

Seriously: You never know what the correct price it. But if someone sells off BTC to buy BCH, it's highly likely that the drop in price will be temporary. It'll correct.
So, buying when someone dumps large numbers if BTC will almost always lead to you getting them cheaper than what they'll be both before and after. The popular term is "buy the dip".

There can be numerous reasons:
- People looking at the BCH fork and thinking a possibility of free coins. (Not likely this time, but still...)
- People expecting the changes in the fork to finally fix the broken EDA.
- People fearing the Segwit2X fork, selling some and putting in BCH (this is probably the most likely)
- BCH supporters mining BTC and selling BTC for BCH might also contribute.
Keep in mind that these two last will affect BCH much more than BTC, because there is simply less money to move around on BCH.

As much as I think BSV is a bad actor, I dispose child porn peddling even more.
Enough of this already. If anyone *here* did it, they should be ashamed.

Basically this all relies on getting a large majority of miners to mine *at a loss for weeks*. They all have to pay their expenses too.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:23:10
Should probably not be too bad. Your funds will get there. Patience.
Note: It's a little more complicated, it's fee per size (not in bitcoins but in bytes) that matters. It will be better if you can give this number, either fee per byte or per kB. But from the amount, it sounds like it can not be that low.
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:46:11
Yah, but it's only because of their own defective EDA, keeping people running to/from the chains like madness.
BTC would cope very well with a chunk of miners deserting it for good, what it doesn't cope very well with is large, seemingly random, fluctuations in hash rate.
BCH has solved it by making it randomly easier to mine bitcoin. But it has caused them to mine about 1 1/2 months worth of *too many* blocks. This will need to be "paid back" over time.
It's a problem for BTC, but it's a larger problem for BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:02:30
It's trading, but it doesn't affect Bitcoin much.
Last time it went up to around $2.5k in Korea (same exchange trade now is mostly happening), it went down again *extremely* quickly to around 1.5k. Then decreasing slowly to 1.1-1.2k.
Now, the new DAA for BCH means, more or less, that miners would have to mine at a loss *all* the time for it to affect BTC much. They can mine BCH, but it would be more profitable to mine BTC. And the new DAA will make it less and less profitable, which means they'll have to push the price higher and higher to maintain profitability.
Not sustainable. Someone has to spend a lot of money to do it. And it's *much* more difficult than last time they tried...
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:00:14
This. I believe that if bitcoin ever becomes truly mainstream, there has to be some sort of custodians. At the very lest multi-sign wallet schemes you can sign up for, that you will be able to ask (pay for?) releasing your bitcoins if you lose your keys.
It's an utopia that everyone will be able to hold their own keys. I hold mine, though :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:41:50
It's been taking time. They have been stalling. Probably because of fork preparations, which are now gone.
But on that note: When's Bitcoin core 0.16.0 expected? That will have more full/complete segwit support, and those who use that in the backend will probably wait for that.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:57:35
Yes, you are correct. Your transaction will likely not be one kB.
It *will* come through. Or it will come back. It will never get lost.
I tested this on a sunday where the fees were on their way down from an all-time high. I put in a fee of 5 sat/byte. It took 36 hours, but it arrived. This was from my hardware wallet on my PC to my spending wallet on the phone, and as you I was perfectly ok with waiting a bit.
Now, if you were doing online shopping, I'd dish out a bit more fees to get it confirmed faster.
But back to your transaction:
20 satoshis per byte *should* be ok for it arriving soonish, 30 sat/byte would buy you a bit more confidence.
There are solutions worked on to make it possible to make another kind of transactions, Lightning, that will hopefully bring both cheap and fast transactions, but that is still not finished. It will need a bit work still, and everyone have to implement support for it.
If you have heard about segwit, that is the foundation for it. Segwit is the foundation for a lot of the improvements to come.
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:32:14
I don't have more in BTC than I can afford to lose. I see it as *highly* unlikely that I'll lose it, or that it will *permanently* go very low.
My recommendation: Don't keep more BTC than you can afford holding through a 2-year dip. For your peace of mind more than it being a realistic scenario.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:07:45
Take note: Bitcoin protocol is meant to stop things like this. If BCH camp fixes DAA tomorrow, they can only delay the inviteable. In reality, I think since difficulty adjustments will be *much* faster after the fork, we will see that miners mining BCH at alarming rates would much more *quickly* correct in the correct direction, that is towards it being unprofitable again.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:08:26
Personally, I plan to do this kind of thing through a bitcoin
backed debit card - apart from perhaps actively looking up a few places that takes bitcoin :) I doubt my GF would be *very* pleased with moving "places that accepts bitcoin" high up on the priority list, though....
So: Look out for "bitcoin accepted" stickers, but if you want to use bitcoin for *everything*, either you need to cash out before or use a bitcoin backed debit card. There are fees on both options.

I am not overly concerned that a coin that is based on attacking instead of competing is going to win. It's not going to build the trust needed.
I am also aware that there are lots of good work being done on Schnorr, Lightning and MAST.

There is a way to set a custom fee in electrum. Try looking in advanced settings, I am not an electrum user so I am only talking from my memory, now.
As for which fee to set? Try see the trends here, and choose according to your speed preference:
Right now, I'd say even 20 satoshis per byte should be sufficient for it getting through in a couple of blocks. Up it a bit if speed matters.

Lightning obviously only makes sense if you are doing more than 2 transactions on a lightning channel. The idea, however, is that there is a network of lightning channels, ending up for example in Amazon. If you have a lightning channel with A, A with B, B with C and C with Amazon, you can traverse all of these and have the transaction end up on Amazon in merely instants. Each contract on the way will be updating their mutually signed "close" contraction as money flows back and forth, and once one part of the channel wants out, he'll just submit this mutually signed transaction to the network and channel is closed and every "debt" between the two parties is settled.
There are  other details in this, but this was the simplified version.
Obviously there might be more than one path and redundancy to get from you to amazon. The actual routing of these LN payments is one of the things that needs more work before LN goes into full scale production.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:24:47
Actually, the 30 sat/b range is not so impossible to reach. It'll get there. After the insane fee situation in the weekend, whether it was spam or panic I do not know, fees have been creeping down slowly. Right now, a "probably in next block" fee is 100 sat/b. This  chart says that there's not *that* many backlogged transactions left before we're at 30 sat/b:
Maybe today, maybe tomorrow is my guess.

Why is it important to support archaic and outdated  nodes? They had years to upgrade. Segwit was only activated when more than 80% of the nodes were ready for it. Since then I guess a lot of late movers have updated their software til.

Uh...you will get the same amount of bitcoin as you sent.
Of course it will not be at the same rate in USD, it would not have been that rate if you didn't send it, and it would not have been that rate now if you had gotten it immediately.

It's likely. But I can't predict if it will be now, to 7k, or if it will be at 15k to 12k.

A simple correction. Pretty normal.
In essence: a lot of people think "ok, this is enough". We will go down to "hell, these coins are cheap". Maybe we're there now, maybe we'll go a little lower. Hard to say.

But couldn't all this be solved with multi-sig and/or smart contracts?
The Lightning node can not do anything except funding channels, and you can take back your money at any time? Wouldn't this be possible? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:02:46
Right now, the Segwit2X is cancelled. This has triggered a whole lot of events - people buying, people selling and people moving bitcoin.
The current craze will pass, and your transaction will go through. If it's not that urgent, I suggest to wait. It will either come back or go through in the end.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:34:51
I'm not actually finished studying *all* the fine details myself. But basically, a transaction with time-locked funds, with a smart-contract that makes it possible to alter the balance of it, is the basis for it. This means that a channel is set up between two people "commiting" an amount of bitcoins to the channels, and moving funds back and forth in accordance with the smart contract.
This can happen through a chain of smart contracts so there is an overlay network. The intention is that these channels should live for *a lot* of transactions back and forth, but making it not necessary to use more than two channels on the blockchain: one to enter the smart contract, the other one to settle. The actual contract is agreed upon during the channel, and "the content" is not changed unless both parties agree. If either party does not follow the rules, the other node can say "that's it! we settle now!"
This is very simplified, the current draft paper is here: 
This thing takes time to implement properly. In the meantime, hopefully segwit alone will be enough. The forks are of course taking time and attention away from implementing segwit in respective wallets, this is quite unfortunate.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:22:20
There's no reason to. People will get it eventually. Once segwit really starts to perform.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:01:18
I am not seeing only that. I am seeing also a lot of people that are disgruntled BTC users. They are firmly in the *cheaper transactions now* camp. They have already made up their mind that this is all that matters, so anything that builds up under this idea sounds fully reasonable to them. Anything that opposes this view, they're dismissing as conspiracies.
The problem is real. It's called "echo chambers". To an extent, they also exist on It is not good. This is why too much moderation can be harmful.

There exists mechanisms like RBF, where you can actually raise the fee post-fact if you are in a hurry - but you'll need a wallet that supports it.
5 sat/byte is not impossibly low. 1 sat/byte might be, but there was recently times where transactions as low as 2-3 sat/byte went through.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:35:20
this, imho, is a difficult question. I guess the degree of seriousity if they actually are gone, is *when* they went, and why. If he ran out of funds, i.e, that the 6400 BTC was not enough, it's not that of a big deal. 6 years ago, this wasn't very much at all. We shouldn't judge it by todays price if this is the case.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:23:27
Everyone knows that bitcoin can not scale to VISA levels without more solutions. Good thing is, there is solutions being developed.
There are two main ideas:
1) Make block biggers and put everything on blockchain, faster and faster in a neverending race.
2) Try to use the blockspace we have now more effectively. And perhaps don't record each and every microtransaction on the blockchain, but use it more as a settlement layer for all these routine transactions.
Personally, I think we'll need both, but do 2 first. There are good work being done on 2, and now the fork has stopped being a nuisance, I hope people will have more time to think on that. The main solution that people are hoping for is called "Lightning Network", if you want something you can google and read up about.

So, I think that argument is false. I will provide a few examples of the same argument used for different  things.
1) Open source software has been portrayed as evil because they allowed to bypass trade embargos to countries someone didn't like. Suddenly, the evil terrorists can use Linux, ssh and web servers with SSL certificates and communication with privacy. How dare they!
2) Where I live, we got a new lightrail system  some years ago. One of the things being used against it for a while, is that suddenly, some of the places it went saw an increase in more shady people - small-time drug dealers, pickpockets, etc. This was actually used against it, that the rightrail made it too easy for these people to move around! In reality, this of course was just a consequence of the fact that the lightrail making it easier to move around in general...

It will always be possible to get B2X if you keep your own keys. You might need to restore the key in another wallet. But it will be possible.
But please be warned: Trying to spend on one chain and expect the other chain to be unaffected by it, that is not something that can be guaranteed. So don't try to sell of the coins you value least, by moving it in an unsafe way. You *might* just lose *everything* on the other chain too.

I agree with the two first sentences.

70% of todays trading is done on bithumb. Bithumb is an exchange in corea with 0 fees on BCH trading. It also allows "wash trading", that is putting out buy/sell orders of the same price at the same time, effectively looking like there is large demand and people are paying that price.

Google Segwit (short-term, will help), Schnorr (effectivising blockspace we have), MAST (likewise), and finally Lightning Network.
All good scaling plans, but they'll take a bit of time. In the meantine, remember to use segwit. It helps you and it helps everyone else.

This is the site I prefer:
It can take some time to grasp the graphic representation. Also, please note that "amount in BTC" or "Number of transaction" graphs are perhaps less useful than the "MB" graph at the bottom.
This one says we're now starting to eat into the 60-80 sat/b range, and will probably go lower today. Usually, fees increase again a bit during daytime in US, but the last days they have generally decreased more in between. Zoom out to 24h view to see more the trend.
Also, note that *a lot* of the waiting transactions have a fee below 5 sat/b, even more below 10 sat/b. This is probably low importance transactions, and they don't really hurt anyone. If you don't care when the transaction arrives, or that it might be dropped off and have to be resent, you can set it even as low as this. But please note that more than the actual transaction amount can be locked up in the transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:19:40
This is maybe - but only slighly - earlier than a normal daily rise. But the general direction have gone down, so barring any new big happenings, things should be way better tomorrow.
Patience. It's not actually *that* bad anymore. I'd not pay more than 80 sat/b unless I absolutely needed it to go through in first block. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:37:04
Seriously: *Noone* knows.
This might be the cheapest you ever see bitcoin again. Ever.
It is a real possibility.
It can also go down 30% tomorrow.
If you believe in long term value of bitcoin, just buy, If you're looking for a good entry, buy a little now, a little later, and a little even more later.
If you're trying to daytrade, head over to and read up on the TA. It won't give you any better results, but at least they make you believe it if you buy into it. And someone will always say "I told you so".
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:08:46
This is why there are other scaling solutions that are being worked on. Read up on lightning, and more effective use of the block space we have (Segwit, Schnorr and MAST).
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:15:06
They are. They are just thinking long term and in a wider context.
I used to think a bit like you. Doubling block size can't be that bad, most civilized countries have high-speed broadband, right?
But then I stopped to think: What about the up-and-coming countries? People that can't afford high-speed broadband? Should we disqualify them from running a full node? Sure, you can own bitcoin without a full node, but being able to run a full node *is* important for bitcoin.
At the same time, there's a whole lot of transactions that don't need to be recorded separately in the blockchain. My "coffee cup" spendings, I'm fine with being layer 2, like Lightning Network.
As soon as we grasp that idea, that Lightning Network is the cash of bitcoin while space on the blockchain is precious, we can stop wasting time with unnecessary block space doublings.
And please note: I agree, if off-chain doesn't cut it, i.e. that it's not enough, we can increase block size. But it shouldn't be what we try first.
PS: If those complaining of high fees could start using wallets supporting segwit, they might even get lower fees themselves *and* increase capacity. We *have* a temporary block size increase that peoplle will not use? WTF?

Agreed, but the longer it lingers, the greater is the risk that he walks in next door and spend the same bitcoin with a larger fee, being included in an earlier block, making the first one invalid.
It's always a calculated risk, even if it's low.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:25:05
I will not.
I believe that at some point not too long after the fork, it will be worth more than now. I believe it's entirely possible - even if not *that* likely  - that this is the cheapest we'll see bitcoin, and the fork will amount to nothing at all.
I'm just not willing to risk my bitcoins!
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:18:52
Of course it can. You pay me any price for it, I send you the bitcoin, Now, if this is agreed upon "outside" the markets, not publishing sell&amp;buy orders, it would be pretty neutral and not affect the markets.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:46:32
Your bitcoins will be safe there on GDAX, as in "you won't have less bitcoin than before the fork". But you'll be less in control over what to define as bitcoin. And you'll be unable to spend *during* the fork. That might actually be a good idea anyhow.
If trying to split the coins early is more important than you being in control, then keeping them on an exchange that promises to let you split the coins might be a good idea. But keep in mind: They are in control over this, not you. When you keep them in an exchange (except perhaps cold-store wallets in exchanges), you don't have bitcoin, you have only a promise that the exchange  will give you this much bitcoin. Whether they have them themselves, or not, is not something you are in control over. An exchange that fucks up during the split, might lose serious amount of money. And you might have to rely upon their solidity financially, and in the last instance, their insurance or what they have.
I'd say keeping them on an exchange during the fork is risky even if you plan to sell them or not.
But that's my opinion, and based on that for me, gians in fiat now is not that important, but long-term security for my bitcoins are.

There is moderation, but it's a double-edged sword. Personally, I think moderation here sort of does not work - sometimes it moderates far too much (there is a lot of auto-moderation, that might explain a lot of it), and some other things like "To the moon!" comments gives absolutely *no* value, and I doubt anyone would see any loss to see it go. But everyone you moderates is going to be a bit pissed - and end up in the other sub, which has a totally different agenda and is just as bad just in another

Lightning will have a setup/settling fee. You won't set up a lightning-channel for just *one* transaction, but if you are doing 3, it should probably be cheaper than non-lightning.
The channel eats two on-chain transactions: One for creating the contract, another for the settlement afterwards. The lightning transactions are just 2 parties keeping a continuously signed status of the funds commited to the channel. This signed status is a transaction that any of the two parties can decide to commit to the blockchain. and everything is neatly settled.
This is of course a simplified view. In reality, there will be multiple hop with such contracts, and the network of between-node-channels will also have to be funded from actual payments. But if you are using it for payments - not necessarily daily, but at least frequently - it will make sense.
Another use case that doesn't necessarily need a longer network, is direct channels with larger entities. Think exchanges: What if you could have a lightning channel open? This would mean that it's actually feasible to withdraw the funds when you went to bed for the night or away for the weekend, with having a way to cheaply and near instantly get it back, should you need/want to do a quick trade.
The size of the actual lightning transaction fees, I guess will be a free market. But there's not so much limited resources here that will drive up the fees, so it should be possible with some real fee competition.
Also: Note that smaller transactions eats less into the funds tied up in a channel. Thus, in case of lightning, it's much more likely that we'll see fees proportional to the amount we send, and low-amount transactions will not have to be as expensive as today.
But all this is kind of guesswork. It's a free market. Much like the transaction fees today, just that there will be much more real competition, for a lot less limited resources.

BCH is relevant because the BCH community tries to:
- spread lies about safety of BTC features
- trick and bribe miners to desert BTC mining, through counterproductive trixing with the difficulty slgorithm. They have now given at least 1 1/2 months advance payment of block regards2, that they are stealing from future BCH miners.

Blockstream, that funds some Core developers,  have plans for some business targeted sidechains etc, and maybe lightning nodes as a service etc would also make sense. Think Amazon. This is a perfectly legitimate service, imho. Think SLAs and tech support - something a business might be willing to pay for.
Sure, it may take some revenue from fees. But they can also run lightning nodes and take fees from there, no?

What there's animosity towards, is that they are trying to appropriate the notion of "being bitcoin", with bitcoin.com propaganda and with tricking users into bying BCH instead of bitcoin.
It's deceitful and it's lying. Noone likes that. It'll backfire.

Plain psychology about the number.
Also, think about this when you think about corrections etc - and actually technical analysis - which I believe predicts quite well what happens, but are quite bad about the *whens*, so it's useless :) But:
At some point, a large number of people will have accumulated a "large enough" gain, and the urge to reap some of it into fiat comes. As people see the small blips that this causes in the price, they'll be nervous this is the top or at least a local one, and some of them will sell. Suddenly, price goes more down, and people sells to get their gains...
But at some point, we will meet up with the "oh hell! bitcoin is cheap! we'll buy here" crowd. This is where there's "support", and price will start to rise again.
This is what corrections are, really.

There's going to be a lot of animosity. What we need to do, is show that we are *better* in that regard.
Many of the disgruntled users of the other coin are - allegedly, I'd say  - users that have been on and been blocked. Now, I do understand that trolls are trolls, but I have had pro-BTC posts that happened to mention the other coins deleted, even when I explained why I thought it should be allowed.
I am pro-BTC, but anti-censorship. There's fine line between moderation and censorship.

Exactly: They know. It's not a problem.
There are two theories:
- It's transactions there to make it seems like the mempool is full. They don't want them actually done, because then they'd have to actually pay the fees. That is called spamn.
- It's low-importance transcations. I did one with 5 sat/b less than a month ago. Went through in a couple of days. Was fine with me, just needed them in another wallet at some point in the future. If it had timed out, that would not have been a problem either.

Use  to estimate what fee to set.
2.5 USD seems like it means it had a lot of inputs, because else it should have confirmed by now.
There are changes that will be implemented that will get down the fees for bitcoins with multiple inputs, due next year, hopefully early. Look up "Schnorr".

I believe that in the long run, this is still cheap.
My advice: 
- Never buy more than you at worst can lose. Totally. Very unlikely, but it's worst case scenario.
- More likely scenario is that it takes a dip and stays there 2 years. Do you need to sell at a loss, or can you wait it out?
As for how likely these two scenarios are, you need to study and form your own opinion.  Only you can answer what you believe.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:01:13
Wrong. All miners pick from highest fees first. If second transaction has higher fee, double spend can happen

What's this? The miner reward is going to half, that is true....in year 2020! :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:37:11
I bought quite a bit in august. Price was $4200. It was *sky high*. After, it went down to around $3000. I didn't panic. I could have sold at a loss. I did not.
Today? Price is $7000.
Tomorrow? It may start a dive, it ending at $5000. Lower? We don't know.
Or it may not. It may continue to climb, for example to $10000. And then start a dive, to $8000. You'll congratulate yourself that you cought the dip, while if you had bought now, you would have saved $1000....
Point is? We don't know. It's not unreasonable to expect it to dip around the fork - but it is *by no means* certain. Already we have seen miners in the NYA agreement saying flat out that they'll mine the most profitable coin. And that will from the start be bitcoin, only a *longer* period of time of miners mining at a loss, we'll see it reverse.
So we may see people growing confident that there is no fork threat. Maybe the price now is actually not expensive, maybe it is cheap? Noone knows what the *correct* price of bitcoin is....there *is* actually no price that is more correct than another.
So why doesn't it go to zero? Simple: Because way before $1000, I would buy a shitload of cheap bitcoins. And so would literally *everyone* else. I doubt it can go to $1000, ever again, unless we have major government obstacles and major security flaws at *the same time*.
It can go lower than now. For sure. But do you believe that mainstream adoption will increase? If so, it's reasonable to expect that at some point price will be higher than now.
My advise: Don't buy more than you'll comfortable being worth less than now, not *having* to recoup them, in several years. Because then you will lose money.
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:28:57
But before you do this, understand that if you do  something wrong, delete the app and Don't have the seed written down for example, you can lose everything. You are totally responsible yourself and if you make a mistake only you can fix it. Others will of course be able to give technical advice, but make sure you understand all implications before you move to your own wallet.
I believe leaving on exchange at the start is a good option until you totally understand what is said above.

If you believe BCH mantra that Bitcoin is cash.
 Can we not say that Lightning network isn't anything other than a safe form of owing each other some Bitcoin, with an escrow so you need not worry that the Bitcoin will not be paid? Now, all these loans can be increased, traded, etc up to the limit that each participant sets. Whenever you want to be paid, you just settle and the money is there. Anyone can settle at any time.

There is a large amount of FUD about Segwit. Basically, all of it amounts to is that it's still possible to run nodes that doesn't validate the signatures part of the Segwit transactions, thereby destroying for yourself, because if you actually tried to *use* the results of those invalid transactions, all the Segwit-validating majority would reject your transaction.
But I have no idea what someone would think they have to gain to create non-valid segwit transactions, *and* getting someone to not validate the signatures/reject the invalid transaction. Or how they'd get all the properly validating nodes accept it.

This plan fell apart because Segwit2X did fall apart.
It relied on both the Bitcoin chain and the Segwit2X chain being unprofitable to mine over a time, thus convincing miners to mine bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:44:42
It was most definitely an attempted attack. It started with someone pumping the price of the other coin to insane levels, making it insanely profitable to mine the other coin. This, they did at the start of a normal difficulty adjustment period, to maximize the length of the attack.
I have seen claims of spamming the mempool to. It's plausible but I have not so certain indications of this

An address is not the same as a public key. There is not on address per private/public keypair, but rather a pretty unlimited number of addresses.
As long as you have not regenerated the wallet (i.e. you have the same seed), you are using the same private key.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:44:01
The wallet is the key to "unlock" the bitcoins. Only you have the key. Now, reason you can actually send to someone is that they get a public (i.e: Look only, don't spend!) key. This is based on public key (assymetric) cryptography, this is the thing you need to google to understand how all this is possible.

Bitcoin fee is bidding for space on the blocks. You can set exactly the fee you want, but miners can choose whether or not they include it.
Blocks have limited space. There are only room for a certain amount of transaction - depending on transaction "complexity", not size in amount of bitcoin.
When a block is mined, the miner picks from the list of transaction in the queue. Naturally, he will picks those that pay best. If there is lots of high-bidders, the low-bidders don't get on the blocks.
Now, most wallets will look at the blockchain, the transactions in the queue, and the fees that people are willing to pay. Based on this info, a wallet will make a recommendation. Some wallets gives you some options, like "super-fast", "normal", "economic", "super-economic".  Some wallets will let you pick as low fee as you like yourself, even down to 0 fee. A miner doesn't have to mine your 0-fee transaction, that would be pure charity. Even a 1-satoshi-per-byte transaction is fee, but some miners would see this as being *extremely* cheap, refusing to pick them. Some miners would pick transactions from the top until the transaction queue is empty, no matter how low the fee is. You might even get your transactions without a fee through, but that *is* risky.
In general, wallets will over-estimate what fee you need, but if paying important transactions and/or online shopping, it might be wise to just bite it and pay the high fee. Bitpay is sort of forgiving, things *will* work if the transaction doesn't arrive within it's timeout, but you'll end up sitting there nervous, wondering if the vendor gets his payment on time.
Now, there are a few sites that can help you pick a manual fee, if you dare. The two I use are  and 
In my opinion, the last one is the best, but the graphic representation takes a while to understand :) When you get it, you'll be able to see fee trends and easily how much fees at each level is waiting.
Summary: Fees are the user bidding for space on the blocks. Blocks full (space limited), the price goes up. Simple.

Lightning Network is the current most promising solution. Basically it's an overlay of nodes that keep track of people sending bitcoins to each other, real-time, over an open "channel". This channel can be more or less permanent. When closing the channel, things are settled on the chain.
Read about it here: 
Personally, I think Lightning will be used for most personal spending, OTC purchases. Conventional bitcoin transactions, you'll use only when it's important for you that there is an actual record of it on the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:03:27
There are solutions on the way that might look big blocks laughable.
Do we want to double transaction count, or do we need to think a massive scaling?
These things take time. Working implementations of Lightning Network is now being tested on the testnet, but the software in itself needs to be made more production ready/scalable. Lightning Network will make it possible to do a lot of transactions with bitcoin "off chain", doing occational settlements on the blockchain, and reserve blockchain space for the more important transactions.
This makes sense if we want to prepare to scale to VISA level. And who needs their coffee cup and amazon expenses to be recorded on the permanent blockchain anyhow? Sure, I agree it's important to be able to do transactions on the blockchain itself, but not all bitcoin transactions are that important.

Why on earth would there be KYC for me and you agreeing to manage how we share a multisig address?
I think the KYC arguments are largely FUD, for a couple of reasons:
- No custodial solutions, noone holds money on behalf of others, payments are only routed.
- This is bilateral agreements, there's no provider/customer here.
- KYC would be extremely difficult to enforce, and regulators sometimes tend to stay off regulating things they can't really enforce anyways.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:27:57
Of course it could.
It's inevitable if it ever becomes mainstream, *and* at least some regulations are there. Keep in mind that banks are heavily regulated, and it'll be a potential problem dealing with things not regulated...
This is a double-edged sword, really. Some regulations, a la "ok, this is how crypto-money works, tax it this way, etc.." is inevitable and on their way everywhere. We'll just have to hope there will not be more restrictions. The ability to send money to anyone and over the border without governement control is a big fish to swallow...

This is more difficult on BTC. To some extent, I guess it can be done. You have to buy bicoins like crazy, and this will of course be more expensive in BTC. There is also a larger market, more actors in BTC, so it's  less susceptible to these manipulations.
Other coins with less market cap and less traders, it's much easier.

@_date: 2017-11-03 15:09:31
This, I have thought about. But I have thought that it's not worth the risk. If the fork amounts to nothing, risk disappears, the dip could be over by the blink of an eye, and we could be way over todays prices. I know, maybe not likely it's over that fast, but possible.
I know what I have now - in bitcoin. I also know that I want to have at least the same amount after the fork, I do not want to risk ending up having less. The fiat value? It may change, but I strongly believe it will go up again soon.

I work in computing. People are notoriously bad grasping the concept that "the computer guys" can not just fix their mistakes. They will *not* understand that there is no way someone can go and fetch them a new key so that they can access their bitcoins....
There will be people to fill that niche, providing custodial services. Heck, there was even a bank in Korea that recently launched one, right?
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:23:29
You need to ask yourself these questions:
1) What would you do if price suddenly dropped by 50%? Would you become uncertain about future? Would you buy? Would you hold off to see if it recovers?
2) What do you think are the *future*? Do you believe in the technology? Do you believe use cases, acceptance and credibility will increase? If so, this *might* be the low you wish for 2-3 months from now....
I was pretty much in the same position as you in august. I bought. Quite a bit, at $4.2k. This was *sky* high. Price was up several 100 % just during july/august.
September, there came a dip. I held.
Could I have predicted the dip? Hell no, I'm no expert. It might have gone straight to $8k (another doubling), then dipped to $5k.  I could have told myself that I was glad I didn't buy at $8k, when in reality I had the choice to buy at $4.2k that I didn't take.
In the end, only you can decide what you believe in. And what risk you are willing to take. And how long you can afford to "sit out a dip".
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:55:21
It's a pump financed with selling off BTC? Would pretty much explain it, no?
Personally, I think this might end up being good long term. Those who hold large amount of BTC distribute them at a discount to other people who want BTC. At the same time, pumping something that's not valued that much in the market is bound to fail.
Sure, it's the market that decides. It's actually that way with fiat too. A dollar is worth a dollar, but the price in euro will be different day to day. But if you pay 1.5 times the price of the dollar in euro,  in *large* amounts, it might show up on the statistics. But it will correct if it's not sustainable.
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:30:51
I agree with this one. I was initially on board with Segwit2X in my mind, until I read about the issues. Both the political, but also the bandwith/blocksize.
I am now on board with those who mean that keeping the blocks/blockchain as small as possible without it able to do it's function is both a short term, but even more a long term goal.
I understand that block size increases might be needed in the future, but as the blockchain can never be made smaller again, and the blocks can only with great difficulty (if ever?) be made smaller again, we *should* try other options first.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:45:41
Everyone can of course do what they want, but *please remember*: There is actual money involved. So it would be totally irresponsible.
This is similar to say that it would be acceptable to install spyware/malware in an apache server, just because apache is open source and modifiable by all. It might be possible, allowed by the license, but it doesn't make it *acceptable*. Neither is making dangerous plays with other peoples money.
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:27:31
I like this one better:
That one says we are now eating into the 60-80 satoshis/byte range, will probably move through it.
Usually fees go up when there is morning in the US, so it might not continue downwards trend throughout the evening. There is usually lower fees in the weekend, so barring any unforeseen events making need for transactions, expect them much lower on sunday. 
Unless BCH is handing out more bonuses on mining again.

LN internally counts in millisatoshi. I once tried sending 1000 1 millisatoshi-transactions to a channel partner (cooperative, of course, the channel partner had to give me 1000 invoices). Granted, there was no routing, only a single payment channel. But I swear it was a magical moment to see the remote balance of the channel (that visually was rounded to satoshis) increase by 1 at the end of the experiment :)

@_date: 2017-11-16 14:26:57
If I was going to buy more every month, I think I would wait a little bit until I had more before I transacted. The fee is not dependent upon the value but the size. The size is probably not going to increase by buying more.
Other than that, the fees are going down slowly. Though, some exchanges are notorious for calculating high transfer fees anyhow, so that might not help all *that* much. A lot of fee algorithms are also quite "defective", I'd say, as they tend to overbid the higher fee bidders, even though they are a tiny amount and will all be eaten along with lower fees during the first block.

Personally, I have multiple "lots" of bitcoin. Basically,  have long-time savings bitcoins, short-term savings and spending account.
Works for me. My short-term savings account will buy me a better vacation than I could without it. For you, it might be a new car that is what you want. My plan is to only spend of the fiat gains in this savings account for now, but with the current growth this means that I can actually spend more than I put into it.
Of course, I *might* also elect to use fiat instead, saving my BTC to my next and even greater vacation. In reality, I think it will be a little of both.
My spending account? I try not to think about gains in fiat here. I just spend from it. Whoever I buy from that takes bitcoin, I pay with bitcoin. Simple. I'll refill it if needed.

The new DAA of the other coin will actually also help us, at times. I believe we're about to regain some sanity in the mining situation. Unless miners decide to go on strike and mine non-profitable coin. But so far, they have not really done that. The weekend debacle was actually something or something propping up the price of the other coin to a level that mining became insanely profitable, and miners mining at an alarming rate. The new DAA will limit the possibility of doing that.
Do I have to write "the other coin" to avoid being moderated? I try not to discuss altcoins *unless* it is at the same time highly relevant for BTC, and in this case it actually is.

I am for segwit, but I do not agree.
We should not do war, we should only perform.
Besides, there can be *a lot* of reasons a person does not use segwit yet. Maybe his wallet does not support it yet, and he does not want to change just yet? How should we differ between people doing "malicious" non-segwit, if such a thing even exists, and people just not ready to move yet for various other reasons.

Neither, really. As long as there will be enough "lightning entry nodes" or what you would call them to select between, there's no reason to fear censorship. Also, remember you can even run your own if you like.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:17:09
Segwit enables Lightning Network. And it is sort of short-term scaling.
But given that "Core" is the name of the group that developes the Bitcoin Core node, which can be seen as the reference implentation as a bitcoin node, I think it would be pretty meaningless for one to say that bitcoin core should implement lightning. They have enabled technology to enable lightning.
Blockstream, however, that funds some of the Core developers, are developing a lightning node. Along with a few other group of people. I would guess there are people contributing to Core that also contributes to Lightning implementations.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:08:16
Sure. If nodes want to not be able to verify transactions fully, they can elect to. But it ultimately hurt only themselves. If they use coins that the network does not agree they have, the transactions will only be rejected. I see it as their problem.
Btw, Consensus was what activated segwit.

Myself, I believe the moral duty is to increase bitcoin acceptance.
Spend wisely. Use in accordance with law.
Sell when you need to. Buy when you can and feel for it. Don't try to manipulate the price.
Trading? I guess that's something we'll have to live with in anything that's worth money. Myself, I'm no daytrader, so I largely ignore it, except that sometimes I peek into it to understand how traders see bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:17:33
Noone doubt the transaction lag.
The only thing we are in disagreement with the big blockers about, is the solution.
Read up about Segwit, Lightning, Schnorr and MAST, and don't believe the FUD. It's just FUD from people that want "cheap transactions *now*". I believe in a long-term solution that does not compromise Bitcoins inherent properties, i.e. decentralization.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:35:56
Because it's disk space used "all over", forever, and transfered all over the network to all nodes when they are installed and when they verify blocks.
Look., I know It's an important part of security. But for my "coffee cup" expenses? Ain't worth it! You can use Lightning whenever you deal with someone you can actually put some trust in - I'd use Lightning between my own wallets, for example, *always*, because at some point I have to trust myself :)
And amazon? Respected company that we trust giving us our stuff, every day.
I don't see the need to record every single transfer on the blockchain, simply. And when we know that for some people, this will amount to real cost, and for example in underdeveloped costs it can even be a significant cost, I believe it's the responsible thing to do to try reduce blockchain space.

LN is not a sidechain.
Here's how to best describe it: You create a smart contract,  basically a multisig-adress with some attached rules, enforceable on the blockchain. This basically reduced the consensus, within the boundaries of this smart contract, to you and your channel partner.
If an channel partner steps out of the boundaries of this contract, the other partner can and will enforce it by settling it on the blockchain 
This contract is basically so safe that a channel partner willingly will forward the payment to other partners for a very small fee. LN is a protocol for facilitating that.

Miners are mining 6 times more than "they are supposed to", now, on BCH. This is because someone is propping up the price like 40-50% today, probably to make it insanely profitable to mine BCH.
This will correct and be more and more difficult to do, though. Just wait till the nonsense is over.
Edit: This is technically about an altcoin and forbidden, but it's an explanation about why blocks are slow on BTC.

Lots and lots.
Basic idea for one of them is: If you and I share the same idea of who owns what part of a pool of bitcoin, we can settle later. Now, picture a large network of people that has an idea of who owns what to whom. The security of this is that at *every* change of this agreement, you just sign a transaction that says this. Whenever one of the parties want to settle, he'll just submit the transaction, and everything will be settled.
Now, in reality, you will not want to settle unless you need those exact coins for exchanging to something else than bitcoin. This is because the fees for settling will be much larger than the fees for each transaction on this  overlay network, and if you settle, and you want to join this overlay network (which is called Lightning network, if you want to see more), you'll also need to pay a fee.
So basically, there will be a lot of transactions that will not have to use the transaction pool before anyone wants to settle. And then it's just one transaction instead of perhaps hundreds from the lightning channel.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:16:28
There are changes coming that does this. Look up Schnorr, that has to do with reducing redundant signatures,  and MAST, that has to do with compressing the data needed for smart contracts, which again is an enabler for off-chain scaling.

It's an attempt at spreading FUD - fear, uncertainty and doubt.
THe only way this *could* work, if everyone at once started believing it.
They already tried it once - before their DAA fix. It didn't work. This time, their DAA is actually working against it. It will not work.
But even if it just partially works, they will win something. Those who fall for it will sell BTC - possibly pressing the price down a tiny bit, temporary (as it was temporary the last time), and pressing the price of the other coin up. The ones who spread the FUD will be more than happy to buy your BTC cheap, financed with selling the other coin that you helped propping up.
It only works if people get scared. I will not be one of them :)

It had an Emergency Difficulty Adjustment algorithm that would adjust difficulty down if hash rate became too low, and it would also adjust up fast, dynamically.  
Since this algorithm didn't ever adjust it down, as far as I recall, and the resulting difficulty lasted for the full 2 weeks worth of blocks, it was easily gameable.  
At one point - probably due to manipulation - they gamed difficulty, make it extremely profitable to mine that fork for a whole weekend, making it more profitable to mine it for that time, leaving very little hash rate for bitcoin. They cheered as fees went up on bitcoin, but when weekend was over, they had several hours without a block.  
A lot of supporters of the fork cheered it, because it caused havoc for BTC. I think this was the final nail in the straw that made it unthinkable for me to actually hold any of that fork coin.  
I straddled away from this principle a while ago, after having watched the 0.11-0.14 "safe" price range of BCH (in BTC) for a while, trading some change I had in an exchange for BCH at 0.11 and thought that at this point, only die-hard believers was pumping it, and was doing it predictably. At 0.08, I cut my losses. Lessons learned, risky to trade fork-coins :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:55:01
Personally, I am at the point where I have some nice gains of my "spend soon" lot of bitcoin. I'll spend part of the gains, maybe rebuying later, maybe not. I bought some bitcoins in august, specifically taken from my "for future vacations and fun" account. Enough that it was interesting, not enough that it'd seriously be a problem not having them for a few years.
Some time next year, I plan to allow myself to take out "everything over 2x the amount I put in". It'll make an impact for the vacation, and *if* the trend continues, I'll be able to do it again.
And then, I have a specific savings bitcoin account, and another "spend on coffee" bitcoin account. The last one goes to pay with bitcoin whatever place I need to buy that actually take bitcoin. No matter what the price is, and no regret about lost future gains. The future gains will come from my long-term savings bitcoin account, which is the largest of the accounts.
This way, I get to cash out some profit now, I support the ecosystem, and I have the potential of a nice profit down the road.
I believe in *this* strategy :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:43:46
You wanted to misunderstand. The contract is recorded on chain. The contract can be settled with a mutually signed transaction that is updated everytime the amount of money anyone owes is agreed to change. Any disputes, and you just settle with sending this transaction to the blockchain. There is really little motive or opportunity to cheat, because Anyone can singlehandedly settle, does not need the consent of other parties. And everything is managed, again onchain.

Unless you like to gamble, the best thing you do now is hold. Anything could happen today:

- people selling again expecting a second dip like the first

- people selling Bch because they had moved there waiting for the mythical flippening, buying back their bch
Impossible to time. If I had some money in exchanges, I would buy the dips

Yup, it does, but there's not all that incentive for him not to cooperate. And it's all automated in node software, it's not like he'll have to do it manually.

Many wallets look at the transactions, see the highest transactions, and say "ok, I need to be at least as high as this to get in the first block". While this may be strictly true, it leads to a "fee race", wallets overbidding each other when in reality there's space for all of them in the first block, or if not then at least in the next.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:34:47
Now, also zoom out. Look at it in a longer perspective.
Normally, the number of transactions is not that high. I believe it was somethink like "a perfect storm".
- Someone pumping BCH
- FUD from BCH camp about the "flippening", causing FOMO (fear of missing out)
- Spam? No proof, but I've heard it said.
We all agree that fees are too high at times. Things are getting done to make the chain less congested. But good solutions can sometimes take time to develop.

BTC will handle losing and gaining some mining power, unless variations are too big. It doesn't very well handle big and random fluctuations. As long as there is *some* mining, things will correct over time, though. The fluctuations we have seen this weekend have largely been fueled by the old EDA of the other coin, which was rather flawed from the start, and in the long run hurt the other coin just as much.

No. The one you are replying to is trying to mislead you.
Once the payment has confirmations, it is done.
Other advice in this thread is good; double check address, check it up in a block explorer, and send the link to the transaction in block explorer to the recipient. This is good enough proof that it's done.
Problem can also be the wallet of the receiver, I.e. that it failed to register the payment.
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:46:19
It means that the channels can't be used as active channels, and have to be closed. You will get your funds in the channel back, but it'll of course cost you fees if you need to open new channels etc. Fees for the force-close is covered by the fee-reserve in the force-close transaction that you and your partner earlier have agreed upon/signed.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:30:44
First: WHat was the fee? And how urgent is the transaction?
Even &lt;10 sat/byte will eventually be confirmed. On sunday, I did a 5 sat/byte transaction between some wallets that was not that important. I chose 5 sat/byte fee. It took almost 36 hours, but it was fast enough for my purpose.
Looking at  I can see that mempool is currently rising. But come weekend, I expect things to cool down abit. It usually does.
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:38:32
Running a bitcoin node to validate your transactions does help with decentralization. It's the only way \*you\* are part of deciding what bitcoin is.
You might want to like one of Andreas Antonopoulus' videos about full nodes. He explains it very well. Just google it, he has a few of them.
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:00:35
No, for now it os only static channel backup. It is only updated every time a channel is created (and maybe closed, haven't checked that). It allows only to restore the private keys and enough data to ask your channel partner to force close with his latest status, and for you to sweep the funds when he does
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:38:34
An uncomplicated channel close transaction is always pretty small, and same size always.
  
Now, one of the reasons for force-closes are actually HTLC timeouts. If you have commited funds but the sending side is uncooperative, you can and should close the channel on them, and that way get the funds. A HTLC is an extra UTXo, and several in-flight HTLCs in that channel will of course mean several UTXOs in the force-close.
  
At least in LND, max inflight HTLCs is a node-configurable parameter.

Much of it is. There has actually been quite a few UX-related fixes going into LND after this.

@_date: 2019-04-06 15:31:37
In some form, I expect them to start appearing in master not long after 0.6 is out. 
But I haven't seen it on a roadmap or had someone tell me, so i5's only my educated guess.
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:31:38
0.6 isn't released, but rc3 is out.  
The most important goodie for me here have been the static channel backups. This isn't the be-all-end-all backup, and it could use watchtowers to be a bit safer - as right now, there isn't all that much to stop your channel partner from submitting an old state when force-closing.
I tested static channel backups on testnet the other day, deleting my wallet.db and channel.db with 6 channels, and restoring from seed and backup. 4 channels I received the funds immediately, but for 2 nodes they were in a waiting-close state for a day (or more, I was away, not watching the state). They eventually closed, though, and I got all my (test-)-funds back.  
I now have upgraded my production node to this one, too, and it does indeed feel good to have a backup of channel funds - allthough it only gives me the funds and not the channels. should something happen.  
There's also tons of other improvements:  
Much better zombie-pruning stuff, which should improve routing quite a bit.
Peer connectivity improvements.
  
Different sub-rpc-systems, allowing things like Lightning Loop (which I have also tested).
Lots of neutrino and autopilot improvements which should pave the way for a mainnet desktop and mobile version of LND.
Watchtowers haven't quite made it, but lots of the foundations for them are ready.
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:54:17
No. The static channel backup doesn't contain any state, you literally just ask your channel partner to submit *his* last channel state.
The static channel backup contains the keys and everything needed to restore enough channel state to claim the funds from that force-close transaction that your channel partner submits.
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:50:44
On the static channel backups we have now, there is not really anthing that stops them from doing that.
This will of course be a ton better when we have watchtowers, because then they'll be penalized by a watchtower if they did it, and you'd get all their funds in addition to your own.
It's a step in the right direction, and probably enough piece of mind for me, right now. But there's a ton of improvements in stock yet.
@_date: 2019-04-06 10:00:00
For now, but as I said: Watchtowers changes that quite a bit. How does he know that I'm not trying to trick him to cheat?
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:28:58
Yes, it is. I fon't actually know the format, but it *is* encrypted with your wallets private key, and you should definitely copy it out of the node.
@_date: 2019-04-06 22:27:03
This problem is actually more or less the same problem as having small utxo onchain. But with LN, you will usually make the channels large enough for several payments, whereas an utxo is the result of one. So on average, this should be less of a problem in LN.
@_date: 2019-04-25 14:00:22
On a blockchain where we have less limitation and there's actual \*usage\*, Ethereum, there's less than 10 nodes left that hold the full history of transactions.  
Full-node and pruning is much better than no full node, but we'll want the full blockchain to be somewhat distributed among more than that.
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:18:06
Even non-rbf it's hardly safe. A miner is of course always economically incentivized to include one with a larger fee even if he sees it later, although there exists a gentleman's rule to mine the first seen.
@_date: 2019-04-06 10:11:30
Read more about it here, especially towards the end:
 [   
The other node doesn't \*really\* know that I have lost the channel state. I could be lying to him, just claiming I have. So if I trick him to submit an old channel state, and have \*not\* actually lost the channel state, just claimed I did, then I am allowed to take all his funds.
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:40:33
A fee market is a fee market, it's based on supply and demand. Block space is a finite resource, and there's lots of reasons why it has to be.
Lightning Network is a way to make instant transactions not have an unpredictable fee and unpredictable confirmation time. It does that very well for small transactions, and this will continue to improve, and the channel balances will increase as trust in the system itself increases.
But: It will still be bound by the blockchain. You *could* make it so that the fee reserve set away does not change with the onchain fee, but that'd make it less safe and less trustless. Safety and trustlessness is always the most important bitcoin properties. Tradeoffs can be made, LN is never going to be as good as onchain in that regard, but we also need to make sure it's "good enough".
I think it's better with a few larger channels than many small, also because AMP is not here yet. But how large? That'd depend on a whole lot of things, not the least how much people each user is willing to put into lightning. I can't take that decision for anyone but myself.
I try not to make channels below 500k satoshi, and even that is rare, I usually try to make it a few million satoshi. It makes them more usable for routing, too.
@_date: 2019-04-13 13:51:11
As long as there is still software that uses that seed format, there will be no problem.
With that in mind, it \*might\* be wise to keep a copy of Electrum somewhere too. It doesn't need to have the wallet, you just have to be able to enter your seed into it.
But I think it's not that likely that normal seed formats will go completely out of use, and at least not have a way to recover funds from them.
@_date: 2018-03-20 10:55:47
I think it will go faster than you think. This august, LN was "18 months away from being on the main net", according to the pessimists. Did that happen? No, it happened *much* faster.
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:07:56
For that to happen, we need quite a few improvements:
- LN needs to be more mature.
- Schnorr
- Sidechains to allow non-economic activity to have a place to spill over to
- Sidechains for easily compartmentable economic activity without the requirements of the full BTC decentralization.
Before we have that, I am pretty happy with the speed at which adoption happens now. We need some real-life usage to actually have a place to deploy and learn when good solutions are deployed, but we're in no hurry to get to world-wide adoption when we can't possibly scale to it anyways.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:47:17
There is no 72 hour rule. It can "stay in mempool" for a while.
But the BTC is never *in* the mempool, they are still in the sending wallet. A receiving wallet might choose to accept that it'll arrive. It may even spend from it, and if it does that with a high enough fee, the miners will include both transactions. This is called CPFP.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:18:32
I agree. But some people are not interested in being part of a war.
We need to fight deception and lies, not the coin itself. Too much war is bound to backfire.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:53:01
As pointed out, it is a bit "risky", in that some entity might come in with a healthy flow of higher-paying fees, making it take longer. Possibly a lot. Security-wise, it's not really a problem, in the mempool they are still yours, but it *can* be a hassle to deal with it.
Consolidating dust? Sure! Moving to segwit addresses? A given, worth the risk! Transacting to others (other than donating, I guess that too doesn't matter all that much. time-wise), I'd recommend a bit of overpaying. Not much, only a bit.
But it's important fthat not everyone is being obsessed about *being in the first block*. If everyone does that, and blocks are normally full, we *will* end up paying a lot more fees than we need. All of us.
@_date: 2018-11-05 13:11:06
This is *why* it's necessary to keep the blockchain small and not a burden on people.
The less people that choose to run a full node, the more they trust others to do that validation for them.
If we get to the point where only the miners, a couple of exchanges and larger shops run a full node, we're basically just a slightly better paypal.
Full nodes matter, but not in the "securing the network" type matters, it's more like "securing the trust".
We trust bitcoin because we don't have to, we can validate. But this ability to validate needs to be constantly proven, it's *not* enough that we are told that "yes, it could in theory be done, supposedly the exchanges to do".
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:18:02
Their loss.
@_date: 2018-11-18 18:16:37
You are right in a way. Small blocks would be better. However, we do need to allow *some* economic activity.
There's no immediate push for changing the blocksize either up or down, now, after the big blockers left. Focus is on building other ways to expand the bitcoin economy: LN, sidechains, etc - and then some more optimizations, like Schnorr, will come.
I believe we'll eventually have to deal with a way to increase blocksize, but ideally we need it to count for more than a linear growth in economy, so we'll get more effect from it. This means we should wait until both LN and the sidechain concepts are a bit more mature. This also means we'll get a clearer idea how much impact it will have.
The best thing would of course be if we didn't have to increase it.
Decentralization matters, the ability to fully validate matters. Because else, we're back to trusting central banks, except that central banks have been replaced by miners.

This segwit vulnerability is probably non-existent. I'd not worry about it, as it comes from compulsive liar with low level of knowledge about the technology. This is literally proven.
He *might* be able to rehash something like the old "if everyone agree to go back to pre-segwit protocol, all segwit coins could be stolen". Duh. If everyone decides to not validate transactions anymore, anything can happen. That's not a problem with bitcoin per se, that's a contentious hardfork. And as we know by now, *the community* decides what sides of a hardfork has value. Would there be value in a hardfork where coins can be stolen or one where they can't?
I leave the answer as an exercise for the reader.

The development of LN has actually been pretty rapid this year. I started following it around christmas, to the point of reading code, following the github (reading issues, following the development process), even did a few patches myself - and it has honestly beaten my expectances since then.
Right now, the only way to really use LND (the only beta-quality LN software, I'd say)  in production is to use a command-line interface. However, there exists a GUI on top of it, which have been deprioritized the last few months. Getting it to work in production will now start working again. There also exists a mobile wallet, Eclair, for the testnet. Once that reaches maturity, we're going to have a very simple mobile LN wallet ready.
Myself, I count myself as the early adopters, I already run a production node with a bit liquidity and connectivity - as an enthusiast only. I know a few others that do the same as me, and we're starting to see businesses implementing LN. Take a look at bight.nl, they have a few products on sale. There's store.blockstream.com, of course, bit also bitcoinshirt.co, and a lot of others that are implementing services.
I will not be surprised to see more mainstream adoption from non-technical users happening already in a couple of months, at least if a production-ready version of Eclair is released.

It's a successful test of the anti-cheat mechanisms. Now, I was one of those he "cheated", and I gave him back the money - at least the bulk of it, would have taken a bit more effort than was worth it to find out the remaining few k satoshi I had routed to him.
Right now, there is no good backup mechanisms - which is why developers still warn against putting more money in channels than you're prepared to lose, worst case. Biggest risk now is still your own operating errors, as shown in this case.
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:53:54
I'm not that much into this "war" thing. The focus should be on creating good solutions, available for those that need it.
People will themselves have to decide when they need it, or whether it makes sense for them to buy some bitcoin just in case. To be honest, a lot of people get pushed away if you try to force things they don't understand on them.
No matter what, we shouldn't try to *force* anything. Mandated currencies, that's fiat. Bitcoin is there so that people can choose to use it, and know that as they do it, they are not trusting third parties.
If that is something the world need, then we need to be the *best* coin ever should the need arise. It does't have to be today, not next year, not the next decade. Adoption will come because people need bitcoin, not because bitcoin needs people. It really doesn't, it's the other way around.

Do we *know* this?
I certainly don't. If I'd *known* that, I'd have sold everything by now. I don't.
Most people that wait for the bottom will probably fail to recognize a bull run until it's too late. You need to decide two things for yourself:
1) How cheap is cheap enough for you?
2) Do you believe we're gonna go higher than now.
The market is highly irrational. We saw that last automn. In 10 days, we *can* have doubled in value, and most people that is waiting for the bottom will have waited for it to drop again, because of their preconditioned opinion of where the low point is.
Fact is: Noone knows how low or how high it will go next time. Most value now is speculation. *I* believe in long-term utility, but short-term, my bets are off.

See, here's the thing: I am pretty sure there will be a dump after the fork, as it has been every other BCH fork. So I would be smart about it. I will just be a bit careful. I would sell before the fork, not after...it would still be a bit of a gain?
This all breaks down, because it's possible that everyone has come to this conclusion, that I'm not a smarter trader than the rest after all :)
So, I HODL. In the original meaning of the word.

There's probably going to be hash wars. This is actually pretty costly, because anything spent on this war is *loss* - for you.
If you want stability, mine BTC. If this war "spills over" into bitcoin, it's going to be in the form of people moving hash rate to BCH to "protect" their so-called investment there. That means that those remaining on BTC have less competition == more profit.
I believe the ordinary miners will gain nothing from the hash wars in BCH.

Hmm. Any clue to the reason? I might need to retract my offer... :)
Anyway, my offer was *mainly* to demonstrate a point: Noone is willing to do this if it involves a significant risk, and if the risk is more for the "fiat" transaction than the crypto transaction, then there has to be a premium for the fiat transaction for people willing to take the risk.
But if this is trustless enough for me, I buy enough stuff on amazon that the 30 euro will be spent there, sooner or later, so the offer was genuine.

Well, yes. But mining profitability is also affected by how much electricity you have to use to mine. This is adjusted approximately every 2 weeks, either up or down.
The miners economy is affected just as much by that, and in fact I believe any change in collected fees over time will become just noise in the equation of mining profit. The DAA will adjust to 6 blocks per hour, like it always have.

Well. If you only spend, this isn't true *at all*. All dishonest channel partner can do is submit an old agreed upon state to the blockchain, which in this case  can not give him more money than is his.
Other than that, "all of the time" is very relative. There is another wallet for Android that can receive, Bitcoin Lightning Wallet. This one has 1440 blocks timeout, which means that you will only have to be online once every 10 days or so. Other than that, it recently also got a watchtower service:
Keep in mind that BLW is kind of centralized that relies quite a bit on the "Olympus Server" infrastructure of the wallet provider, though.
No phone wallets require you to have the bitcoin blockchain downloaded, they all use a remote full node. There is a new light client mode, Neutrino, on the way, that will make this much easier to do, too.

No. It is not too complicated.
It is only too complicated to solve *perfect* routing, but it doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to be good enough.
Yes, there is cost with an extra hop. I admit it, I don't know where the fees for a transaction will end up, but let's be generous and give each hop 5 satoshi.
Let's say the perfect route is 5 hops, but a good-enough route is 8 hops. In reality, we're likely to *approach* perfect, but let's say 8.
We now have 25 satoshi for the perfect route, 40 satoshi for a good enough route.
This is what difference the users will notice with a perfect vs. a good enough route.

Do yourself a favour. Find some tech to follow, like LN - or something other...build something? It makes Bitcoin much more fun ��
@_date: 2018-11-05 09:26:27
As I see it, the *only*  thing needed to do, is to make crypto as good as possible so that it works when people discover and uses it.
"Forced" usage of something, that's what fiat is. Fiat is the governement telling it's citizen that *this* is a currency you need to use if you want to pay us - and you need to pay us taxes.
Now, I live in a country where the taxes actually gets people some nice services - a decent education, decent health care, basically no people living on the street unless there are other reasons for it (even drug addicts will get a place to stay, but there might be rules for that that they're unable to follow) - so whether taxes is good or if it's governement theft, that's a totally different discussion I'm not prepared to take here :)
 Now, crypto, on the other hand, is a currency people can choose to use. They don't have to. We need to build it as good as possible so that people who choose it, can. And those of us who want and have time and resources, focus on building good showcases, demonstrating that it works.
But too rapid adoption isn't necessarily good. We need to be able to learn as we scale upwards. Right now, we're in the middle of the development after having learnt that "on-chain isn't the be-all end-all scaling solution". It was a fight getting here, and in the end the big-blockers went and created their own coin, which I think was good for all parties.
In short: Patience. Rapid adoption is not needed. Focus on building good solutions, and people will come.

Paypal is a centralized solution that *can* be reversed, and in fact this isn't an uncommon scam in crypto space. 
For this reason, you're not going to get someone to do this trade with you without a significant premium - to cover for the risk of fraud - unless they know you, or you have a good rating. 
There exists places like localbitcoins where you can do this and are rated by your trading partner. In there, you can prove yourself to be honest, and over time be able to get people give you better rates. But there'll always be a premium that's higher than non-refundable methods of trading.

As I see it, cheap power is "a bug". If you slashed power prices for crypto mining in half, world wide, the power consumption more or less would have to double to provide the same security! And likewise, if you doubled power prices, you'd just use half what you do today!
Since it's an open market, this will of course mean that bitcoin business will move elsewhere. This is fine, and it's a decision each place has to reach by its own.
Bitcoin doesn't need power to be cheap, but it naturally will tend to gobble up the cheapest power - like all other industry where power prices is the major factor of profitability. Because of bitcoins difficulty adjustment, expensive power is actually fine for bitcoin, because it can be made cheaper to mine bitcoin. It's not the same, for example, with other power-intensive industry.

Short answer: No.
Long answer: Bitcoin is not a policitial movement. It's hard, validatable money. Nothing more or nothing less.
If you want to create a recipe or simplified way to *enable* people to choose to do this, that is fine.
But not everyone with LN channels have the same goals as you.
@_date: 2018-11-10 11:02:27
It can.
Bitcoin is a decentralized project, without a central leadership. Its governance is operated by the rather vague "consensus". What consensus really mean, interpreted in my non-bullshit terms, is that most rational people with knowledge is for it, and the rest can be safely ignored. Consensus doesn't mean 100% unity.
This means that bitcoin leans towards the conservative end, changes are pretty difficult to do. For things like protocols, economy, and all the things that is important for bitcoin, this is *actually* a good thing. Software projects should be agile, but the outside should be able to depend on it not changing radically over night.
Lower fees is not  a goal that trumps other goal. Consensus now seems to be that we should try the optimizations and the ways to *not* having to increase the blocksize first, because increasing the blocksize first is just kicking the can down the road.
My personal belief is that what keeps "the cryptokitties" away is that fees tend to rise if there is too many transactions. Bitcoin is a coin in actual demand, with actual value, proven over time. Building your product on bitcoin is going to be highly desirable. I believe a doubling gives us at the max 6 months before "spamish" services would eat it up.
So, should those spamish services just go somewhere else? Wouldn't that help that somewhere else?
No and no. We need to give them a place to be, and it can be in the bitcoin ecosystem. The proper place, however, would likely be on a sidechain, for things that is not directly economic transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:22:05
You are correct about a lot of this. However: Do you believe it is unimportant to make sure miners that unilaterally change the rules have a reduced chance for financial gains from it?
Sure, other miners will catch it. Maybe after 3-4-5 blocks. But do we not care:
1) That all the transactions in the orphaned blocks is effectively null and valid, and all the coffee cups that was bought with BCH in this time was essentially give for free?
2) To limit the chance of miners actually being able to spend ill-gained mining reward?
I get it: Miners that does this *will* get punished, blacklisted, etc. It's not in their interest. But what if they
1) were forced?
2) Had acute economic troubles making them not care about long-term but prioritize short-term profit?
Keeping economic activity validated against non-mining nodes *do* increase the financial security, but not the technical security.
And for something that is money, *this* is also extremely important.

Yesterday, fees was higher. I was doing some LN-related stuff in the morning, paying only 2 sat/b.
It took almost 24 hours to confirm.
Had it been important, I would have paid 4-5, and it would have confirmed in next block actually. Later in the day, the demand for block space was a bit worse, making the reasonable fee for a relatively fast confirmation up to a bit more than 10 sat/b.
But as it was not important, I was pretty happy having paid only 2 sat/b. This is bitcoin. We know that a transaction isn't it someone elses custody when it's being transferred. It's either in your wallet or in the destination wallet. In the mempool, it's just a request for transfer, still in your wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:41:16
I feel it's actually pretty useful, myself.
Sure, there is no "global" mempool, but the top-end of the mempool should be fairly identical, no? Take the number of transactions and total memory usage, with a grain of salt, but it is a very good visulisation about the *trend* of the mempool, a valuable tool for those who want to calculate necessary custom fees.
bitcoinfees.earn.com is usually less helpful and doesn't visualize the trends over time.

I see the watchtowers as a mostly a part of the game theory - i.e. the incentives to stay honest.
I could have a store, and suddenly have downtime - for example connected with a flooding somewhere and you knew the store was based there. Channel partners might take the chance of guessing that "No way will he be up again in 2 days, I will publish an old channel state!". Watchtowers is the part making it not possible to predict/know whether or not your offline channel partner is watching or not, even if you know his part of the world is under 10 feet of water and his node is down. But in reality, I don't think they're *really* gonna be used much, as in having to punish evil channel partners. But it's still important that people use them, because people *should* expect that their channel partner is using a watchtower.

This is the thing.
Moat people don't realize this, but banks *do* give out more loans than they have. This has created a few financial crises, and nowadays at least where I live, banks are required to hold around 12 percent of the assets themselves. This means actually that the rest 88 percent doesn't really exist, and if they hold 13 percent they are allowed to decrease this to 12 percent by giving out loans of money that *does not really exist*.
This is made possible because money isn't *really* backed by anything anymore. It's numbers in a database.

You are correct, in a way. The success of bitcoin would be ensured not by how much we can store on the blockchain but how much we can make sure we don't have to. Aggregation is a thing in a lot of economy. You pay a phone bill each month instead of paying for every single byte. You pay TV/Netflix subscriptions, etc.
LN is one way of aggregating economy, registering only the sum of the blockchain. That will allow a ton of not increasing the blockchain.
Sidechains have a great possibility. A lot of traffic on-chain now is traders sending BTC back/from/between exchanges, to earn money. Liquid is meant to reduce the footprint for this on-chain.
There also exists non-bitcoin-economic activity on the BTC chain, that will eventually be pushed to sidechains.  is the one that has had attention, but likely there's others. I think there's an unlimited number of projects that would *love* to use the bitcoin blockchain for their needs should capacity increase to allow more low-fee traffic. Fees being driven up will make Veriblock on-chain less viable.
You are right that the ability to initially sync the chain is vital. Only those who believe bitcoin is/should be comparable to paypal downplays this issue.
@_date: 2019-01-31 09:03:22
I think the "having BTC as the world coin, *now*" camp, is a distraction.
What we need to focus on, is bringing trustless, decentralized economy to the people who *value* that. And we're not gonna see people understanding that on a global scale just yet. Fast money and cheap fees will continue to lure people until they run into problems with it, but that's *fine*. Bitcoin doesn't have to become the world currency now to succeed.
If we disregard the trustless, decentralized part, we're competing in a whole different market. There's a ton of solutions that opens up then. Fintechs are going to eat cryptos market for lunch in that space.
So: Of course we need to scale. But we need to do it only as far as we do without sacrificing our trustlessness and decentralization. Because that's bitcoins true value, *not* cheap and fast.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:52:24
Well. If a route had to work on the first try, he'd be correct. But a node may silently retry the 2nd (and 3rd etc) best route.
A node can of course also learn from it's last attempt at routing. If you look at every route attempt in a vacuum, he might be correct. But node software can of course learn states.

Miners are mixing up "hashrate follows price" and "price follows hashrate" again.
Miners have gone to mine BCH at a loss, for a while, thereby making it even less profitable to mine BCH.
It never continues for very long, and usually we'll then see some rapid blocks clearing a bit of the mempool.
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:10:32
B) SPV verification gives way too much power to miners. It's a false statement that only miners need to run nodes, incentives shift radically in this case. Case in point: With fewer full nodes, miners could easier unilaterally activate protocol changes! SPV nodes are in general good for "following the longest chain", but doesn't validate much else!
D) About the Segwit2X hardfork, I am glad it failed. It was a backroom deal created at a conference, and that is *not* where bitcoin consensus is formed. Sure, you can discuss and agree on what to work on in conferences. But there *is* a reason there was eventually a *spoken* policy about "no decisions ever should take place at Scaling Bitcoin conferences!". Conferences generally favour corporations and others that can afford sending a lot of people to the conferences. Yes, there were Core developers there that signed the deal, but *everyone* signed only for themselves, there *is* noone that have authority to speak for anyone else.
Segwit2X succeeding would have been a success for "corporate takeover" bitcoin and a failure for consensus forming in the truly decentralized way. The decision was *much* more socially important than technically important, imho.
Fact is: Bitcoin will scale up when it's sufficiently evident that bitcoin is not viable without it, so that there *is* consensus for it. Right now, we have much blockspace to save on LN usage, sidechain usage (this one has huge potential, I believe), and other optimizations.
For every MB we add unneccessary to the blockchain, bitcoin lose. It will increase the sync time for new full nodes, too. This is actually a underestimated problem, we can't just keep adding the size of the blockchain faster than technology improves. And today we are actually doing that. There *is* a reason people are even saying 1 MB is too large.

In B) you aren't wrong per se, it's just that with enough full nodes, there *are* incentives for miners to stay on the coins that actually makes it possible to sell their coins to pay the bills. If most people and even shops would run SPV, they'd follow whatever the miners dictated.
Thinking about this a bit more, let's say there's a majority of economic activity that uses their own full nodes to validate their activity. In this case, it'd be a risk to validate transactions that did *not* confirm to these nodes, because you risk yours coins being invalid where you wanted to spend them!
Yes, that people actually run their a full node to verify their activity *do* give them more power than not doing it.
D I think any increase will have to show *more* benefit than we lose, and that we don't lose anything we can afford to lose. Thus, it's up to those who want to hard fork to higher blocksize that have to prove that it's needed and that it'd give a significan gain. In my opinion, what we have lost from having full blocks is not the *useful* transactions, it's the spammy transactions. SatoshiDice type things etc, that might be cool to think about but not something it's worth to increase block size to keep on-chain. Currently, a lot of these games are moving to LN, where I believe they rightly belong.
Being a blockchain developer doesn't magically make you get this. What those who have worked on centralized blockchains fail to understand is how difficult it is to do this decentralized.
And you are right. Anyone can hardfork. What we want to maintain are the incentives to *stay* on the consensus-agreed chain. And for that, miners need to be accountable to someone.

Uh, wrong. They set up a channel to *your* node, but channel management is always done by both nodes, there's no supplier or customer in the LN protocol (but of course, in real-life LN channels will be used for that, too). The point is that it don't have to be funded at your end, that is the point.
Of course, your wallet could be a custodial wallet somewhere else, but this is not a custodial service.

Any fraud in Lightning has to be solved by closing the channel. The most likely way to try to perform fraud is to submit an old channel balance. That is done by using a presigned transaction that both parties have agreed to, and the funds are fixed. There is  timelock on spending the output - for the one submitting it, the other party have their funds at once.
There is a safety limit that prevents anyone to empty their channel totally.
If someone submits an old channel balance, the other party - or a watchtower - will have the whole channel balance, also including this reserved balance that is left on the fraudsters side, to spend from. This ensures that anyone submitting a fraud proof will always have more BTC to use on fees than the one submitting the old channel balance, and it's extremely unlikely it shouldn't be enough.
On top of that, it will of course be possible to do CPFP. This is mechanisms that one that can prove fraud has available immediately, while the one publishing an old channel balance will have to wait out a timelock of at least a day to do something.
And when I say "the one able to provide fraud proof", of course I mean that persons node. This isn't something people will have to worry about themselves, all nodes actively watch the blockcchain for transactions closing their own channels, and will automatically take action without any user intervention upon a fraud.

I have a dualist strategy when it comes to BTC.
I have something that is stashed away, for spending when it becomes worth quite a bit more. I have an idea in my head about where it'll need to be before I will spend it. I have a 10-year horizion, at least, for this. This lot is little enough that I can afford to lose it all, worst case, but enough that I'd cry if I lost it :) It's not in the suicide-level loss, and it won't seriously affect my life if I lost it. It's not enough that I'll be "extremely rich", unless we are in the McAfee dick-level prediction area.
But just stashing is no fun. I also have some BTC that I spend. And here, I don't even think of price. Can I spend bitcoin here? Then I'll do it! Lightning Network? Even better!
Last, I have a stash somewhere in the middle. Something in between, that I will sell when around half of it is worth "my total initial investment". From there on out, it's just profit, which is good for self confidence and piece of mind.
But the spending is the most fun. I do spend. But I treat some of my BTC as savings.
As for other than BTC? I'm sort of a maximalist, I believe BTC ecosystem will expand to encompass most other use cases, via solutions like Lightning Network and sidechains etc, so long-term alts will not be worth it. But I will not deny that there might be easy short-term profit for it, or that some alts can be perfectly fine payment coins for those places that don't take LN yet.
As for the "low amount" you can throw in, it's still worth it if you believe it's going to go up. But only you can decide whether you believe that, and none of us can predict the future. Those who say they can, are lying :)

Current LND autopilot isn't that good. It makes rather poor choices. I prefer to do my channels manually.
Choose some shops you think deserve your incoming liquidity.
Create a channel or two to some large nodes - but not all of them.

1. Only use for now can be cathegorized as tests - although there are a few brave souls that have launched production services. It's likely that you will need to transfer funds to a new wallet to use lightning, at least initially - although it's possible that more cutting-edge wallets will implement lightning in the wallet over time.
2. Segwit is where there will be new possibilities. It simply allows more things. Other than that, spending from a segwit wallet will always be cheaper. I'd consider moving the coins to segwit.
3. Still viable. If you have coins you don't think you want to spend at all, there's no real need to move to segwit. 
There's no real end-user lightning wallets for now, and no software I'd recommend for end-users.
When lightning is deployed, *my guess* is that a lot of people will run a lightning wallet on the phone - but some would run nodes all the time on a server/desktop machine. The last case will be mature much earlier than the phone wallet, simply because it's what's needed to build the network.
If you are interested in lightning network, I would recommend playing with it on the test network. There, you can run non-production ready code, do mistakes, lose money, whatever you like - because coins are testcoins and not worth anything.
See  if you want to have a go at running a node at the testnet. It's not that easy, but it's fun if you make it, and you'll be ready for Lightning much earlier if you have tried it out at an early stage.

The reason we're seeing a lot of energy being used is that there's an abundance of cheap energy available. Bitcoin doesn't really need the energy as such, rather miners will use as much energy *as is profitable* to use on mine. If energy is cheaper, it means they can afford more energy.
Bitcoin would survive perfectly well if all energy for bitcoin mining was 10 times as expensive as other energy, the problem with that is that energy is an open market, and there's no way to enforce such a policy. If a country should enact that policy, miners would simply stop mining in their country and move to a country where mining was cheaper.
That said, if there is true demand for that energy elsewhere, the price would usually rise. This is why it's reasonable to assume that a lot of the energy is surplus energy, and energy that's not easy to store (renewable energy).

Wallet of Satoshi is a custodial wallet, but until we see watchtowers etc appearing and be a reliable service (which may not be that far), there'll be tradeoffs to make.
Bitcoin Lightning Wallet actually have created its own temporary infrastructure based on some of the concepts, in the Olumpus server.
Eclair can not yet receive transactions.
A few of the other wallets is little more than remote control of nodes somewhere else.
Watchtowers is a key component in the safety of receiving LN transactions for units that are offline for longer periods. Until those start to appear, mobile wallets will all have to have tradeoffs and probably trust infrastructure elsewhere to a certain degree.
Note that this safety problem is not there when you only send transaction, which is why Eclair, that can only send, doesn't have to do that.

lntips is custodial in itself, but those who have put funds in it has to have done it from an LN wallet. Of course, that might also have been a custodial wallet, that's not possible to know.
To withdraw, you need an LN wallet. I have no love for custodial solutions, but I also recognize that it's not currently that user friendly to do it yourself.
On PC/Mac, I think I'd go for LND - and then there exists various administrative/gui solutions for it that are progressing nicely.
On iOS, there's not many options.

If banks start to use bitcoin - at least in the true sense - it would mean that bitcoin have fixed the bank,
Now, I realize that you shouldn't underestimate the possibility that banks will start selling or lending out bitcoin they don't have. But a bitcoin will always be a bitcoin, and it's backed by nothing but itself. If they have lent it out to you, it's not *backed* by something they have.

There will be mobile phone wallets - there is one in test, Eclair. Since watchtower service isn't implemented yet, it can only *send*. Which is probably ok for your use case.
Only sending money, it will be *perfectly* safe to not watch the channel all the time. Watching the channel will only be necessary if there was ever a time that *your* balance was lower than currently, and in a spend-only wallet, that will never happen.
Once we have watchtowers, it would be almost a dead given that trying to cheat will lead to loss of funds, so it'll stop being a worry.

1) Noone will open a channel to do *1* transaction over it, then close it.
2) No coins are deposited to a central authority.
None of these question actually makes any sense. I'd recommend playing with it on the testnet to learn how it works. That's what I did, and plan to join the mainnet during a soon coming beta (personally, I don't  see the point for myself to join mainnet at this point)

Patience. There needs to bra few building blocks first. I also believe watchtowers are higher on the priority list.
However, one of the prerequisites for AMP is the ability to send without an invoice, apparently. And that was merged in LND just recently
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:25:28
Now, since I am not into propaganda, I will also tell you the downsides/pitfalls.
When you do a payment, you are basically sending your channel partner (let's call him X) a promise of a payment, and say that "if you forward this payment to Y", you can have the payment. The payment is time locked for quite a while, to give him time to do this. The payment again contains other payments, this is what is called "onion routing", and for each step the timeout decreases, so that there is a safety limit for each step a payment is routed.
The problem is to get a "success" or "failure" on time. Right now, there's quite a bit of old and buggy nodes out there that fails on giving a "success" or "fail" in a timely manner. What we need to get better at is to learn from such failure and avoid routing through nodes that fail to perform in a timely manner.
I am pretty certain that it can become a lot better than now. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 05:29:55
A is quite correct. Necessary is a social agreement here.
B is not about raspberry pi's, really, or IOT devices being able to be full nodes, although those kinds of devices still being able to work is a consequence of our success of *not* raising the bar for running full nodes. I know it can't stay that way forever, but letting the requirements rise too much is *bad*. Bitcoin was created to be validated by all participants that needed to. Taking that possibility away destroys a very fundamental part of bitcoin.
I encourage you to think: *What* is the fundamental reason we trust bitcoin, and put value in it.
C) I don't disagree that cryptokitties are a legitimate use of *a blockchain*, but growing the main chain to "onboard the cryptokitties" are foolish. Sidechains are invented. The building blocks are largely there, see for example  - anyone is welcome to create gaming-oriented sidechains! Gaming and money are two different use cases and are better off in separate chains -  but they can still be linked!
D) Sure. But would it help any? See C. Is it a legitimate reason for a disruptive hard fork? I believe hard forks needs to be super-necessary to be justified. Hardforks are disruptive, and not to be encouraged. Any hard fork has the potential to turn into a chain split. See BCH/BSV, ETH/ETC, etc. It diminishes the security of the blockchain, we're better off united under same PoW. That said, this means we *will* from time to time have heated discussions. Segwit2X's to argue about. But as a whole, it does make us stronger.
@_date: 2019-01-01 14:34:00
Please show me the research showing that this  
a) Is necessary  
b) Won't affect the cost of running a full node (bitcoin is meant to be validatable by \*everyone\*, not only large actors)
c) Won't just automatically be filled up with "cryptokitties" anyway, thus effectively just  being a drop in the ocean at the cost of more centralization incentives
d) Won't affect the orphan rate, i.e. increase block propagation time

LN: 
- Watchtowers are progressing nicely
- Neutrino is getting closer to mainnet.
These two are probably the biggest blockers for a mainnet version of Lightning Labs' GUI client, which is built with portability in mind and will probably be available on mobile not too long after desktop.
I expect this to happen well before the summer, but things take time.
- AMP. There are some prerequisites to AMP that is being merged these days, the "sphinx send" feature.
- LND will have channel fund backups pretty soon, too. This together with watchtowers will be risk-reducing, which will probably lead to increased deployments and more liquidity.
Further than that, it seems the number of places that implement LN functionality increases these days. I also look forward to it being implemented in Electrum.
For Bitcoin:
- Neutrino (as stated) will allow for better SPV wallets.

There will always be different use cases for on-chain and offchain.
There are times when block variance is too high - and 0-conf  never were and will never be safe. For commerce where people expect to be given their stuff at once, we benefit from the pre-confirmations.
This is actually a pretty underrated benefit. With LN, you lock in the onchain transactions *at the channel opening time*, and each and every transaction benefits from that - but there is of course the consensus between the two channel partners. So: your old LN-channels can't really be doublespent in a traditional way.
But what about the closing transactions? Well that's multisig, and your channel partner can not change that one without you agreeing to it! He can't submit something you haven't agreed to. There's only the "old commit transaction issue", but you are in control over that one yourself, and can manage your own risk - you can decide how long the timelock will be, and you can make sure you have your node running at least daily to check for channel closures.
Then, there's the microtransactions. It's viable to send sub-cent transactions on LN. On  I run a blog with volountarily LN payments instead of advertising, as a proof of concept. A "like" is 0.01 cent. And it's doable without going custodial!
But yes: There will be transactions still on-chain, especially in periods with low fee and little congestion. And the high-value will likely always go on-chain. Low-value and especially commercial/shopping will likely more or less move to LN as people see the benefit.
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:16:29

What about pre-paying in a self-order automat?
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:27:36
I guess we \*could\* see solutions where the wallet provider either have or partner with an onramp-node, to fund a channel when a user create a wallet.  
I guess it would be possible even to fake a dual-funded channel, by one party sending an onchain-transaction to the other, and that other using that as a push amount when opening a channel.
Right now, I guess it would be difficult to have a remote node opens a channel with a mobile wallet. I mean, the mobile wallet would have to allow incoming connections and have a public ip-address. But technically, I guess it \*is\* possible for the mobile node to set up the tcp connection and have the remote node initiate/fund the channel?
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:11:19
Each channels state basically can be described by a set of transactions, one for each of the channel partners, that gives each of them the means of 1) sending coins to themselves with a timelock, and 2) to their channel partner without a timelock. The timelock is there for safety reasons, as seen from the blockchain, there will be many such valid transactions - the timelock gives enough time to prove it was invalid. See my answer elsewhere in thread for this, about watchtowers.
So, for each transaction these commit transactions are updated. The network part of LN is making this happen safely over many channels, so that no node on the way can run away with your funds.
The way this is done, is that the payer sends a a payment that can only be claimed (and as a last resort, settled on the blockchain) when a proof can be presented that the destination has got its money. This claim is forwarded over several hops, so the claiming happens backwards from the destination towards the payer. Anyone who has gotten the proof that it is paid has forwarded the money to the next node - but he also has a method of either claiming it from the previous node or settling on the blockchain should the previous node fail to cooperate.
No bitcoin changes ownership until it is paid to the destination, and if it is not paid within a timelock that is encoded in the payment, every payment is cancelled and the funds stays in the LN wallet of the payer.
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:30:25
No. You create a lighningnode, but they open a channel to it.

Can also go the route with ie a tipping site, see for example [ \- this site doesn't run on my node, it has a limited access to contact it, though, just access to create invoices and check if they are paid.

Don't we all wish we had bought a ton of bitcoins a couple of years back so we could be our own Pineapple fund!
Myself, I don't hold that significant holdings, but I donate here and there. Mostly to people providing value to the crypto community so far.
But I had an idea a couple of months back, that I didn't actually get around to doing yet. I was considering actually writing some novels. It would be sort of action novels, and crypto would be central to it. But the main persons would be people with good beliefs, supporting good cases, good organizations. Each book would present their work for that organization.
Here's the deal: I'd give the book away for free, but with a donation address, and a promise that *half* the bitcoin would be donated to the organization the book was about! Since it's on the blockchain, some of it would of course be verifiable, although the actual payout they'd have to trust me.
What do you think, viable idea? Would people actually do it?
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:45:23
Right now, I don't think there is enough transactions that being a routing node purely is worth it finsanciall. You incur some onchain fees, and there's setup costs. I do it now because I believe LN is the future of online bitcoin payments. The number of transactions will increase, and if you are running a business selling stuff for bitcoin, you had better be researching about how to provide LN right now.
But of course LN is growing, and personally I am seeing more LN transactions passing my node over time. Still not a lot, but I have asked other node operators, and they're saying the same.
There's going to be routing fees to be had, but you can also use it to save fees on your own bitcoin transactions. Or your customers transactions.
Or - just learn some new technlogy :)

1) Ming always becomes more or less profitable, the whole time. If hash rate disappear because of it, difficulty is adjusted down, making it more profitable again (i.e. less electricity/resources used). If hash rate increases, the difficulty is adjusted up. The goal is to always have a block every 10 minute. Additional strain on blockchain? Not if all channels on average are used for more than 3 transactions...but you're right, not everyone can create a channel at once :)
3) Quantum computer is expected to make other mechanisms (like SHA256 etc) less secure, so initially quantum computing will make some security mechanisms worse. But this is no worse than anywhere else we trust SHA-algorithms, which is pretty much everywhere. Security will have to be upgraded because of this.

No reason? I opened 8 channels, for a whooping 1306 satoshi in fees in total. Over that, I have sent 6 transactions for a total of 3 satoshi in total (3 of them direct, 3 with one hop).
Btw, reason I opened 8 channels is not because I needed to, it's because it's fun and cheap. It also helps decentralization (although, of course I risk my node becoming a centralized node - that can always be routed around, of course, so no worry!)
In addition, there's of course some people who have opened channels to me, so now I have 16 channels. I have funded 8, for a total of $0.11.
I can now send LN transactions independent of blockchain fees. This morning, I withdrew 105 satoshis from mainnet.yalls.org just because I could, for free :)

The other "problem" with LN is that there'll not be channel space enough for world wide adoption, making it take years and years before a billion people can run LN because blocks are only 1 MB. See the contradiction? Can't have both of that happen.
In reality, this will end up somewhere in between. There will always be use of on-chain transactions, and people will need to open - and sometimes close - channels. I think people will learn to be not as time-sensitive with their channel openings - and/or be willing to pay more fees, because a channel is used for many transactions anyways.
@_date: 2019-01-02 05:45:59
You don't ensure that. Currently, I think fees might be a bit on the low end, but basically it's up to each node to set their own fee policy. If some nodes decide they want to keep fees low to let people get into and play with LN cheaply, then that's what you have to compete with. I don't think there's too much money to be had from being a routing node yet, but there's nodes that have a more expensive routing policy (like a feerate of 0.25 percent of tx value) that still are doing quite well, this shows that there is demand.  
Most people running nodes now, I guess, either does it because they want to learn, or to use it for their own transactions - whether they receive payments or they are more payers using services.  
You are wrong that it's batching. I use to think of it as 0-conf transactions with better security. 
A 0-conf transaction is a transaction that is not yet mined, but a shop might still accept it because they are reasonably sure it will be mined.
A payment channel-transaction is a multisig-transaction with properties  that makes it submittable by \*both\* parties at any time, with reduced risk for doublespend. The doublespend protection is the timelocks on force-closing of channels, giving you (or a watchtower) ample time to correct the issue. This added security makes it safe not to submit it to the mempool, which means that should you later decide to change the amount, you \*can\* do so! An LN transaction thus doesn't create more data to be written to the blockchain when the channel closes (except in special circumstances when things go wrong), so it's not batching.  
LN is made up of many such secure payment channels, so secure that nodes are willing to pay on your behalf to the destination \*even before\* you have given them money. The first part of an LN payment is you sending a cryptographic proof that these money exist, and a hash that together with the proof that the payment is paid to the end can be submitted to the blockchain if necessary, to claim the money from you. Now, since neither party usually want that, because that incurs fees and will lead to new channels having to be created, things are settled safely between channel partners and the ready-to-submit transactions are updated with new balances.  
Hope this has increased your understanding just a tiny bit.  
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:59:13
At this point, I believe it's people that understand that even 1 sat/b will confirm eventually, and understand that it's *perfectly* safe to put such tx in mempool.
Mempool doesn't really *fill up* as such, 1 sat/b is of no importance as long as you are willing to pay 2 sat/b.

Exactly. And the Lightning nodes that over-charges *will* not be used. And well-behaving nodes will be used for routing.

Good choice, btw, I love my Trezor, and have a new version on my way. It will also give me a little more peace of mind during upgrades etc, I will have a backup Trezor with my coins should the upgrade go botched. I plan to use one as my backup Trezor, but both holding the same coins with same seed (and yes, I do inherently trust my seed, but still - it holds real value)

Do you have a local firewall on your LND? Try allowing port UDP port 1900. This is UPnP, not NAT-PMP, not sure yet if some port opening is needed for that.

Depends. The value of a bitcoin will increase in proportion to how much people in the world want to have in bitcoin, in total. Sure, the price now is inflated  based on how much people *think* should be placed in bitcoin in the future.
Personally, I think bitcoin market cap will increase, and that means that a bitcoin will have to be more worth. We have already mined 80% of the bitcoins that will ever be mined, so most has to come in form of increase in price of a bitcoin.

In LND, it's a parameter called MinChanSize. 
I have set mine to 100000, but there are those who chose a higher value than that.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:41:22
You are right - except that you don't *really* know whether the low point is $7.5k or $1k.
Of course, since you still believe in the future, but does not own any BTC, you *want* it to go down to 1k before it goes up again, because then you can buy more. This is a "false wish". If you believe we should be higher in the long run, you might as well buy *now*. Unless you have some real reasons to believe we shall go down to 1k.
But like the rest of us, you are just trying to guess the bottom, to get the maximum out of the fiat you want to put in. And this, in itself, is part of the reason for the downward trend: People that believe it will still go down, and waiting for the "right" time to buy.
Some people call it Technical Analysis and "support lines" etc. I call it the 'when "shit, we are going down, I have to sell now to not lose more/get my profit" meets "oh my god, these coins are cheap, I have to buy now"-point'. It's much easier to understand :)
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:27:33
The same way we prove that even bitcoins exist.
The protocol guarantee it and each party *validates* it.
When you have a channel, you have a transaction ID from the funding transaction. Then you *know* how large the channel is. When a transaction occurs, you'll validate the updated channel balances against what is recorded in the funding transaction. If it doesn't add up, it means someone is doing something fishy.
Without somewhere to validate it, i.e. the blockchain, it wouldn't be trustless, and it could in the end allow horrible things like fractional reserve, i.e. people using/trading bitcoins that didn't exist. People are doing that with fiat. People are even doing that with gold, today. If cryptocurrency isn't better, this means the project is lost and doomed.

Disclaimer: I have looked into only one implementation, LND, and not much of the others..but:
At least for LND, there is work going on for running on a pruned node. There is also preliminary support for neutrino mode (i.e. sort of a light client) where you can run against another node in the net).
As I understand, the APIs are more or less done, quite easy to work with (people are adding support here and there in almost no time).
I think Lightning Charge is sort of an ecommerce implementation of Lightning. Not supposed to be sending from that :)
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:48:39
This one is pretty detailed:
But, TLDR:
A watchtower gets a blob for each channel state change in a channel. That blob will contain proof that the previous state is invalid, and enough information to create a valid transaction that spends the timelocked funds in the force-close transaction.
The force-close transaction has two outputs: 1 to the one submitting the force-close and one to the other party. The other party can spend their coins at once, the funds of the one submitting is timelocked for a number of blocks (that the other party has agreed on). That is: Someone that presents the proof that this transaction is invalidated can spend the coins immediately without any delay. This is encoded in a smart contract.
The information that a watchtower gets is basically the txid of the force-close transaction that was invalidated, plus part of a transaction that spends the output.
As you might have observed, the two parties in a channel need to have a different force-close transaction, one that locks its own funds and make the other funds spendable by the other party.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:08:17
Currently, they are broadcasting channel statuses over their connections. It's a bit chatty, but I believe there is constant improvements on this area.
The reason Flare isn't implemented *now*, is that it's of course not "easy". It's not "impossible", just "not easy" :) I think the pressure for releasing a first beta of LN has been quite hard. We'll see an LN network that works - just not to world domination -  but if the scaling solution takes long, we *might* run into scaling issues before then. In the long run, I believe none of this is unsolvable problems.
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:13:11
It's all about incentives. Right now, it probably does not pay off to run a full node if you only do a couple of transactions now and then. It actually costs you more, in CPU, bandwidth, etc.
With bigger block sizes, the cost of running a full node increases. Right now, anyone running a business at all can probably run a full node. Should the blocks become significantly bigger, the cost of running a full node *would* exclude the lower end of the businesses from running full nodes. If our goal *is* significant world adoption, we'd eventually end up with only the very largest businesses (think exchanges and Amazon-size) running full nodes.
This is actually a problem. We *need* full nodes, because they are very much part of the *financial* initiative to keep others (and miners especially) honest. Were people to verify their transactions with SPV to miners' nodes at a large scale, we'd have a disaster in brewing - we'd have radically shifted the incentives for miners.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:43:00
Then, you actually need to contact the exchange. It's not lost, it's in the control of the exchange. When it has 4400 confirmations as seen by you, it also has 4400 confirmations as seen by the exchange! So it's likely they've lost track of it or some such, I have no idea how the exchange has implemented their systems....
Need to contact their support, as far as the blockchain is confirmed, that transacvtion is *long* done and finished.

Sure, it's still early. And normal people should consider their LN wallet a spending wallet, and only top it up as much as they are comfortable.
A person that regularly loses their wallet on town will eventually learn to not bring more than they plan to spend that night. However, some people are comfortable bringing along $1000 or more, because they are well versed in keeping their assets safe.
Likewise, a person comfortable with securing services can put in more money in LN.
Can there still be bugs? Yah. But I have been following the development closely since a bit before christmas, have seen the quality improving day by day, and believe the beta release is *not* random, it means it's at a quality that it's recommended for early adoptors on the main net.

@_date: 2018-02-20 16:36:59
At this time, I'd recommend you set one up on testnet, and plays around.
There's not much money/utility on mainnet yet, because people understand that so far, it is *still* mainly for test, but with real coins. I'll explain:
- You can still lose coins. Either from your own fault, because software is either unstable or not so user-friendly yet.
- You will have to close channels every now and then if you update software. Because at this stage, keeping backwards-compatibility between versions is not a priority. This will change whenever there is released a version that is meant for use on mainnet.
- Noone is running nodes on mainnet for economic reasons at this moment, so we don't really know what the fee structure will end up. I would guess people at least would want to regain their on-chain fees, but what that amounts to in LN transaction fees remains to be seen. And businesses like for example amazon is likely to subsidize fees for their customers to get more customers, instead of needing to regain fees.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:31:47
I'll try come up with a longer explanation later. (Remind me, if I forget :)
The basics is that this is not a "store-and-forward" solution.  The transaction isn't done before it's negotiated all the way through, and it's designed to be atomic.

In this case - that it was proven to not have negative effects to raise block size - it would be easy to get consensus for a block size increasing hard fork.
It couldn't really be done in a normal soft fork, although there have been proposals like extension blocks etc. Imo, a hard fork would be a much cleaner approach to this.
But take in mind that this is a pretty academic exercise right now, as we *know* that raising block size has negative effects. There's not likely to be consensus for raising the block size until the benefits outweighs the negative effects. And for that to happen, we need a lot of other technological improvements. In effect, we'd at minimum need a block size increase to allow exponential economic growth, instead of a mere linear as the "on-chain scaling is the solution" theory allows for.
But you are correct that the value of BCH would likely drop a lot in this case.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:17:37
Of course we all hodl because we believe in a profit. I bought in late, am now a bit at loss compared to FIAT, but I have *just as many* bitcoins as I had yesterday. I didn't plan on selling today, I didn't plan on selling this year - maybe not for many years.
Now, at the same time, I bought a bit that I plan on spending, learning to use. It's a bit annoying that if I spend now, I will do it at a loss. So for now, I hold off on this exercise, it gives me a bad motivation to spend at loss - even though it'll probably not amount to much :)
But reason I got into bitcoin is because I believe blockchain-based currencies will be a large part of the future, and bitcoin being the most well-known/accepted coin, it's the safest bet right now.
How much did I by? Enough that if it doubles each year for next 10 years, it'll be the largest part of my retirement funds. Little enough that I can afford to lose it :)
Now, I have divided my holdings into a long-term "savings" account, a short-term savings account (think next years vacation - or the year after, if we're in a dip next summer) - which I'll fund my bitcoin debet card with (another part of "learning how I can use bitcoin today"-strategy - I'm sure I'll get a lot of "just convert to FIAT then fund a normal debit card, it'll be cheaper"-answere here :-)), and then a spending-account which it's meant for learning to use.
I do this because I believe bitcoin will continue to increase in marketshare. And because I'm a geek - and if I lose it, I'll write it off on my "geek" budget :)

This is decided by the fee, which is measured in "by size" of the transaction. A segwit transaction is defined to have less size than a regular transaction, so you will need less fee to achieve the same speed.
The amount, i.e. 1 BTC, 100 BTC og 0.1 BTC does not matter at all as for how larg fee you need.

This has some very good points. The only way we *trully* can adopt crypto in the way crypto should be adopted would be by improving the user experience for doing that *hugely*.
I think you're never going to ordinary people fully grasp and take the responsibility for securely managing their own keys. 
But an example I take from the top of my head right now, and thereful have not thought out fully, that *can* be done, is adding third party trusted entities providing the backup services.
So, you have a seed. You'll either have your "bank" create it, or you create it yourself. But there might be possible to have services that keeps backup of those seeds, possibly with a way to designate that "if I die, my son will get my seeds". 
Now, that service *should* be different from your "crypto bank", if you choose to keep your bitcoins custodial. Now, I am *all* for the idea that we should teach people about the dangers of custodial, but we do have to be realistical here.
These seed services should provide that service and only that, have standardized and *vetted* procedures for handling that stuff. In no way should they be authorized to actually move your keys. Now, you can possibly authortize them to provide the keys to third parties, like your bank, and you *should* have your public keys to be able to any time fully validate that your bank holds your bitcoin.
This is merely an example on how "custodial" can be made a bit better. It will always be more bitcoin to do it yourself, but for those who can't or won't for some reason do that, we need to make sure there are services offered that makes it as transparent as possible.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:33:12
Currently all channels is known by all nodes, and your node picks the best route itself. It us pretty much consensus that releasing a good enough LN that is good for the beginning will be done before the more advanced routing is implemented.
There have been successful trials with a routing scheme called Flare.
The anti-LN crowd will tell you that the implementation of this routing protocol is impossible. They are right if the goal us perfect routing in all cases, but in reality it only have to be a pretty good routing in all cases, and *that* is perfectly solvable.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:24:30
Seems to is the keyword. Larger blocks increases the advantage of running centralized,  I.e. it increases the disadvantage of being far from the other miners, and it increases the cost of running full nodes, which again over time reduces the number of full nodes among those that gives the coin value.
Last point is however less important than the mining centralization and can to some extent be helped with xthin, graphene or other solutions.
BTC focuses more on the decentralised and uncensorable aspect of the coin, while BCH seems to value fast and cheap more.

Disclaimer: I am not american.
But where I live, if I am *only* an employee, only owns registered stocks and funds in accredited institutions, etc, chances are my "reporting taxes" will be simply "I agree with your calculations". Everything is pre-reported and pre-calculated, and unless it actuall looks "off", most people is not going to actually do the same calculations as them.
Holding/using crypto-currencies, I'll actually have to do something. This means I'll have to wait until a day I actually have a bit of time, to calculate all of this. 
So: The early reporters will be those with less complex taxes to report. Crypto-currency actally complicates taxes quite a bit.

LND does not require btcd any more, it can use bitcoin core. I'd recommend trying that - I *think* it's a bit more mature than c-lightning currently, and there is not a lot of crash reports like there is for C-lightning.
But there is still work to do, *especially* on the userfriendlyness front. Noone denies that.

You won't "move" a test node as such into production. Now, you might see that some people feel they have learnt enough, and decide that they want to reuse the same software installation on the same machine for their production node. But actually "moving a node" as such between test and production can't really be done. It doesn't make sense. Test nodes is funded by test bitcoins, and production nodes will be funded with production coins.
In my opinion, it's more important to actually keep production separated from test, so that people *don't* mistake production from test. Not that there'd really be any danger, it'd just not work and be confusing for users :)
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:25:56
Will not. Few wallets have upgraded and almost  no exchanges. Once that is done, we will see a real increase. 
I would not be surprised to learn that quite a few of them is waiting out the split either, although I admit that falls in to the specultations category.
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:29:36
I think I know what I mean. And there is no such race conditions, except in relation to perhaps routing - i.e. another transaction might have depleted the funds in the channel between route finding was done and the sending node initiated the fund transfer.  In this case, the client will have to go to the step of selecting the next best route and try that one instead.
But in the actual transfer of funds, no. In the transfer phase, we lock HTCLs (hash-timelock contracts) for the actual funds, so they can't be spent twice.
I think everyone know that the routing protocol as of now is a bit simplistic to arrive at world domination. Luckily, world domination will probably give us time to improve it before it arrives.

OK. Let me come with some *good* suggestions about things we can do. Myself, I am more interested in technology,  devoting more time in testing Lightning Network etc lately....
What about an anti-FUD page, that:
- Refutes/clarifies all the quotes taken out of context that the other subreddit is so fond of spreading.
- Clarifies the relationship between the large players in the BCH camp (i.e: What entities invest in whom. That will show who is *really* pulling the strings and expose the "grassroots campaign" they are claiming.
- Clarifies the roles of Core developers, Blockstream etc. and explains the concepts of funding open source. Remember: A large number of players does not grasp that hiring open source developers *usually* means that you funds their freedom to continue doing what they want to do in whatever way they want, in return for *some* of their time devoted to company projects.
other things.
I believe *strongly* in fighting FUD with facts.

He raises some valid concerns, but a lot of it is exaggerated. No time now to refute everything.
Realize this: Rick is firmly in the other camp. Almost noone in crypto is "neutral" these days, so it's almost always necessary to know the bias of the one making claims. He's likely to dig up any risk and blow it out of proportion.
None of these concerns are new, really.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:42:13
My guess is that if we have misbehaving nodes regularly, there *will* be a rating system, and there *will* be routing protocols that take the rating system into account.
There is much talk about Lightning as it works today, and then just dismissing it based on that. In reality, the current implementations of Lightning Network is approaching the first usable stage. After *that*, tons of improvements are possible.

Much good advice here. Myself, I held all the way to 19k and down again. Don't regret it. I bought at lower than the current price, didn't really *expect* or need this level of price increase by this time, so I'm good with the ups and downs.
But I didn't buy more than I can afford to lose. If you have done, then the calculations may be different for you.
And seen from a money/investment perspective, I will come to a price point where I can sell off my initial fiat investment (plus a bit) and still have a healthy lot left. That will make it psychologically a lot easier to ignore the price.
We humans are strange, this way.

I agree. This is a risk at least initially. But if it creates problem, it will be extremely easy to create extra channels to route around the centralization. I would much rather risk some centralization  on a second layer than a centralized core layer.

- Most online commerce uses LN or other mechanism.
- On-chain will be settlements of those, but also a lot of the cases where an intermediate would be used to eliminate the "chargeback" risk today: Think cars, houses, other kind of large payments.
- There will be a lot of activity in sidechains, special purpose economy: In-game economy, etc.
- Speculation and trading will almost exclusively be done in sidechains. Regular currency trading today worries about *millisecond* latencies. 10 minutes will simply not be good enough. Hobbyist purchases will probably still be on-chain - or perhaps transferred via LN.
- Fees will be higher, of course, but as each transaction now represent much more economic activity, it is not so grave. There will be people who literally live off just one or a couple of LN channels, that they never close, but always refill their channels.

The requirement to run a full node will soon go away, with neutrino. A lot of people use that on the testnet.

I don't think we'll have to fear that we need to handle world-wide scale just yet - but the goal should of course be to be able to do it.
In the future, I guess you could as an Amazon customer set up an LN channel with Amazon. I would do it. I already have to trust Amazon when I buy from them.
Or some variants of this. But I think off-chain for day-to-day microtransactions *will* be the norm. Handling microtransactions and regular commerce will go via off-chain mechanisms - but of course regular transactions will be available if you need it.
I think this is crucial to understand. It's not like LN will *replace* on-chain. If you need your transaction to be logged on the blockchain itself, like if you buy a new car or house, you will pay a premium for this service. Hopefully, this premium will not be in the 10's of dollar range, but rather a dollar or two, as most people will move to LN because it costs them less.

1. Don't know, probably not. I think there is actually key rotation on channels. But this could be implementation specific.
2. A node actually knows only it's previous hop and your next hop. It doesn't actually know the public keys for the rest of the transaction. This answers some of it?
3. Yes. But will probably be a bit clunky. Here's how it *could* work. This would depend on the firmware of the hardware wallet, so what it can and can't do can change.
- You'd need the private key to open a channel. So only you can open channels, or you'd have to be present and cooperate for channels to opened to you.
- You'd need the private key to send, but that's hardly a problem. You'll need that today too. Now, I believe there are probably multiple things to sign, so you'd need several confirmations on the hardware wallet. A bit clunky, but could probably be done. 
- You'll need the private key to receive. You could in theory do that, but you'd have to have your hardware wallet activated before you could receive.
- You couldn't realistically watch for breaches, so you'd have to always use 3rd party watchers. Might or might not be a real problem, and would be the same problem as mobile nodes. This problem could be eliminated if you *only* wanted to send over the channel. If you never receive, there is never ever an older transaction your counterparty can transmit that will give you less money than what is yours, because your channel balance will obviously always decrease, and all earlier ones would give you more money.
4. You can run lightning towards a full node on the net, much like you'd run an SPV wallet. There is some fairly new protocol modes that are likely to be included in full node software, called neutrino mode, that allows this. You could also run in a normal way but with the full node you run against on another machine (i.e. not on the phone). If you run out of battery on your phone for three days, *and* you only ever send coins via lightning (don't route, and don't receive), then you are in no danger. If you receive on a cell phone, I think you'd always use a 3rd party watching node (or several).

Take note, moderators! The narrative in the other threads is that people get banned from for voicing their disagreement.
Now, I have been on the Internet for a good 25+ years, and I have seen my share of trolls. I definitely understand that at some point, the amount of trolls can get simply...too much!
But every guy we ban is one more guy that tells their tale of the "Core shills in My quest is simply to reevaluate the strategy of
- censoring people discussing altcoins like BTG and BCH - at least for a *while* after the forks. It *is* relevant for bitcoin.
- Censoring people that are for segwit2x - we *need* to hear the arguments. And counter them. Banning is not countering.
Now, I do not know to what extent the censoring goes on. I just know what the narrative is other places. We need to make bitcoin succeed on it's technical merits, *not* because we censor all opposition!

This is as expected. As it currently not profitable to mine BCH (compared to BTC), all the BCH miners is now mining BTC.
This will continue until next emergency difficulty adjustment, after which half of BTCs miners will mine BCH again. Even BCH community recognize this as a problem, as they are now *way* ahead of the number of blocks they *should* have mined. That wil have to be "paid back", so between EDAs the difficulty will be gradually worse each time....

Of course we all hodl because we believe in a profit. I bought in late, am now a bit at loss compared to FIAT, but I have *just as many* bitcoins as I had yesterday. I didn't plan on selling today, I didn't plan on selling this year - maybe not for many years.
Now, at the same time, I bought a bit that I plan on spending, learning to use. It's a bit annoying that if I spend now, I will do it at a loss. So for now, I hold off on this exercise, it gives me a bad motivation to spend at loss - even though it'll probably not amount to much :)
But reason I got into bitcoin is because I believe blockchain-based currencies will be a large part of the future, and bitcoin being the most well-known/accepted coin, it's the safest bet right now.
How much did I by? Enough that if it doubles each year for next 10 years, it'll be the largest part of my retirement funds. Little enough that I can afford to lose it :)
Now, I have divided my holdings into a long-term "savings" account, a short-term savings account (think next years vacation - or the year after, if we're in a dip next summer) - which I'll fund my bitcoin debet card with (another part of "learning how I can use bitcoin today"-strategy - I'm sure I'll get a lot of "just convert to FIAT then fund a normal debit card, it'll be cheaper"-answere here :-)), and then a spending-account which it's meant for learning to use.
I do this because I believe bitcoin will continue to increase in marketshare. And because I'm a geek - and if I lose it, I'll write it off on my "geek" budget :)

Right now, you need a full node for operating a node. There is a new light client mode in development, Neutrino, which will fix that. After that, you can run LND towards a remote node. There will, however, be the same considerations as with any wallet. You have more personal security with a full node.

I think utility will drive adoption, adoption will drive user acceptance, and user acceptance will drive price. I try to tone down the "too the moon" memes, I am a believer as far as I believe there's more than 50% chance that Bitcoin will prevail, that it'll increase in value, and probably eventually stabilize somewhat higher than where we are today.
How much higher? NO idea.
When? NO idea.
So I try not to trade, I follow the technology, and stay informed. I buy some, I use some, I play a bit. And I support those willing to spend time on implementing stuff. I contribute a bit to Lightning Network testing, I donate to a few of the good crypto-tools-web-sites when I feel like it. Would I mind getting rich? Nah, noone would.
Price will go up and down, we all agree on that. Eventually, if it reaches some of the better predictions for this year, I will likely sell off some that I get back my total fiat investment. Will bring the more economic me more piece of mind, but the realistic me has already written off my crypto holdings as a potential loss. All of it - even though I don't believe it :)
My goal is to learn, to find out how *I* can use it, and just have fun with the tech. Rich? Sure, noone would mind. But I try to tune down my expectations, myself.

I am pondering how to bring along money to be used "on the town". I mean, in the hypothetic bitcoinized future we are all talking about.
So, my current plan is 2-of-2 multisig. Befure leaving house, I sign up for a maximum amount that I want to spend this evening. This, of course, with a hardware wallet. The other key resides in a normal software wallet, on the phone.
On town, you'll be limited to use the set amount. If you lose your phone, you can revoke the permit to spend the money.
Recovery upon stolen phone:
- Revoke all permits from the hardware wallet.
- Create a new walled based on software wallet seed.
- Create a new multisig wallet, fresh key for software wallet at least..(I'm on thin ice technically whether or not you can replace just one key?)
- Create an unlimited permit on the old software wallet.
- Move all funds to the freshly created multisig wallet from the hardware wallet, with a more or less atomic action to both enable and move away the funds from the compromised wallet.
Would this be doable? Secure enough?

You need to have a wallet that gives you the possibiity to have custom fees. Some do to some extent (i.e. letting you choose a level like "super economy), but may still calculate too high fees for this purpose.
Once you have selected such wallet, look at this site whenever you need to send:
You will normally specify a fee in "satoshis per byte", that is at least what this site uses. You need to look at the estimated confirmation times to the right, and use the fee (to the left) that gives you the time you can live with waiting. It's not accurate, it's not "guaranteed", but it's good enough. Especially for your purpose. 
I also use it for external bitcoin transactions, i.e. online payments in bitcoin, no need to pay more fees than necessary...but don't be *too* cheap there, you'll want your transaction to go through fairly quickly when buying something :)
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:18:18
But you did send them. You just sent them to yourself.
Bitcoins are divided into "chunks" of bitcoin, called UTXOs. Whenever you send a transaction, you need to send one or more UTXOs - you can not divide them without it being recorded on the blockchain.
I can see that a couple of hours ago, you got a transaction of almost 7.86 BTC to the address you have given. Even though I can see it is several inputs, the transactions will have joined them into one UTXO. The transaction that you have sent to buy a new Trezor is 0.0153 BTC for the Trezor, and 7.84 BTC to yourself, and the transaction you got a few hours ago is the UTXO you are spending.

People are in crypto for various reasons. Not all of us are here to avoid taxes!
Personally, I live in a country with pretty high taxes, but I still have money left to have a good life, and even some to buy crypto.
For my taxes, I get:

- Decent, free education
- Economic safety net (there's not a lot of very poor people)
I happen to like it here, and partly because of this. So I will continue to pay my taxes, thank you.

Agreed. I see *lots* of traders hoping for a dip to get in lower.
While I would *probably* buy more if price should get a serious (like 20%) dip, I'd much rather see a slow, steady climb and less volatility.
I believe that bitcoin should be more worth today. I don't know how much, but it's only logical. But that *is* also dependent upon price stabilizing, and I'd like to see that happen.
I might not become a billionaire. But I'm happy just having gotten my coins as cheap as I have. I expect to start using more coins at some point - right now I have a large part of my bitcoins saved for usage in the future, when price has stabilized (I am obviously betting on the price stabilizing higher)
(And for sake of interest: I have enough bitcoins that I would hit my head with something if price went to zero, but little enough that the "something" will not be mortal or give me serious damage :)
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:45:07
It's possible that everyone who buys now will win, even if they HODL until bitcoin has "stabilized".
Risky, sure. But there's a lot of more risky stuff that people invest their money in.
And in my opinion, it's not even that long shot, to do it. I believe bitcoins "stable price" is quite a bit higher than where we are today.
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:46:25
It did, but it still varies.
Approximately 14:10 until 15:20, a bunch of transactions coming in with 10-50 sat/b fee was beeing eaten - but before 15:30, a block that ate the rest of those and down into the 5-10 sat/b segment was mined.
See  if you want to understand this.
There is also RBF that you can use, if you want to be able to raise fee.
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:10:31
A segwit transaction is per definition counted as being smaller. The fee per byte is the same, but the transactions are smaller.
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:50:01
Probably there is not more transactions, but we know there are less miners because BCH had an EDA. Luckily they will have a regular EDA making it several 100 percent more difficult to mine, in less than 24 hours. That should bring miners back and things would creep back to normal...

This is quite academic....but for a chain to have value, someone would have to buy it. Now, why the *heck* would I pay for coins in a chain where people were not validating signatures of transactions?
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:19:36
Remember: The settlement is between you and your channel partner. Not all the channels your transactions have ever passed, *only* your channel partner.
The settlement happens when that channel is closed. At that point, there are two possibilities:
- The channel partners cooperatively create and sign off on a spend transaction, sending N to partner X and M to partner Y, and spending an agreed upon part of the balance on on-chain fees. 
- One channel partner needs to close while the other partner is not online. He'll now use the last balances. Now, as part of that last transaction, the other partner will have pre-signed off on a spend transaction. This transaction, the other party can submit directly to the blockchain.
But in both cases, this "rounding" is between only *two* parties. All other parties on a lightning transaction will have their own channels with their own balances, that will get settled when those channels closes.

This is due to BCH EDA (emergency difficulty readjustment).
Explanation: Mining bitcoin cash can be done with same equipment/setup as mining regular bitcoin. Miners, at least some, will switch chains if the other becomes more profitable, i.e. that the coins mined*price is higher.
The EDA mechanism was added to BCH to readjust difficulty more quickly to make it profitable if it becomes too difficult/unprofitable to mine over some time. This has the effect that we'll have wild swings and not so much predictibility.
But fear not: The algorithm does correct itself over time. In a little more than 24 hours, the difficulty to mine BCH will increase 400%, so miners will switch back here. Things should sort out.
So: Either live with things taking very long, pay a higher fee, or just wait with the transaction until some time tomorrow. Can't be helped. Not really bitcoins fault that BCH makes hash rate highly unpredictable.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:15:46
There's no real reason it should crash, as long as people still agree that it has actual value. Take note: This is *not* much difference between how for example gold is valued.
As I see it, it's logical that trust should increase, barring any legal/regulation setbacks.
We are witnessing the birth of a new asset class. This happens much quicker than the birth of for example "gold".
I would say there is no real precedent. I think the *real* case for bitcoin (or similar, I keep the door opened for it to be replaced with "something better") is that there is a need for something something financially neutral (as in: not linked to dollar/yen/whatever), easiliy transferable  (not the case with gold).
Should it be able to scale as a currency through lightning or other scaling solutions, it will further bolster its position.
But keep in mind: Like other things, this all hinges on the assumption that at the end of the day, someone will be willing to pay for your bitcoins also tomorrow and the day after. If enough people trust bitcoin enough for that to happen, I believe we'll have a long term success.
As for bubble? Sure, we might have small and large corrections to come. But if uptake increases, it *is* logical that the value should increase also from here. Rememer: The price of a bitcoin will be equal to the amount of money people want to put in bitcoin, divided by the number of available bitcoins. The last number is known, the first is not.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:10:47
I don't think we should. We risk ending up as an "echo chamber" if noone is exposed to anything but news from pre-approved sources...

This is actually a bit complex but a bit genious. No transfer of money takes place before everyone have cryptographically signed off on it. For you, everything happens between you and the channel partner, but you won't pay him until he has presented you with a cryptographic proof that he pays it to the next hop, through another channel. This ends in the destination, of course. Now, *every* channel has this same setup, it's a shared multisig address that channel partner validates against.
This was a quite simplified explanation, there are quite a few exchanged proofs one have to go through for this to actually be safe for all parties :)
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:02:04
Different priorities.
BCH wants to be "fast and cheap" now.
BTC wants to be "decentralized and uncensorable".
There's nothing inherently wrong with either, the problem is that they are so determined that they are *right* and all others are wrong that they need to launch a campaign to try to tell people they are the real bitcoin, and that everything and everyone involved with BTC is bad.
*That* is what's bad with BCH. Not the coin in itself. Problem is, without that confusion, it's more likely their coin would have dwindled in value and knowledge long ago.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:01:51
First: relax. Your Bitcoin are safe. Second, for anyone to check, we'd need the transaction id.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:48:02
THat's why I said "if" :)
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:23:42
First, the only way to be prepared is to keep your bitcoins in a wallet where you own the keys. Only then can you be in total control.
Second: To to do research into how to trade, now is probably too early. An exchange that has said they support 2X is coinbase. But noone has so far said anything about the level of how they support 2X, and all the status pages/overviews about who will support 2X is way old. The only ones you can be sure will support 2X (but probably not "Core") is those controlled by the people behind 2X.
As for the probability of the fork happening? I will not even try to guess.
I only know that I will make sure some time during the days before the fork that I have no bitcoins in any exchange whatsoever until days after the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:16:08
It's forked. You have them, as in they are locked in at the time of the forking block. But to spend on the new chain would be highly unwise, without replay protection. In general, wallets, exchanges and services try not to make their customers lose money, so they will also be reluctant to implement support before replay protection.
As for mining it - I don't really know the status of that process.

You're not paying anything in advance, you're putting it in your ready-to-use/quick wallet. If you were paying in advance, that'd mean someone could refuse to give you back, go broke, etc. and lose your funds. That's not the case, they're in *your* end of the channel until you pay.
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:44:30
As much as I agree that very large blocks isn't a good idea, this article is wrong. It's not the verification of transactions that costs energy, it's the hashing algorithm, i.e. mining the new bitcoins! Larger blocks wouldn't be that much more expensive, energy-wise, but it would take longer *time* to transfer and validate a block. This would shift the balance towards more centralization of minings, into specialised data centers - and eventually with dedicated lines in between them if allowed to go on long enough. Congratulation, you now have a "paypal 2.0 with a blockchain under", and not a decentralized world currency!
Exactly *where* the limit of what block size is considered safe is, I'm not going to discuss here. But my take is: "As small as possible to make the coin usable!". And if you can make it usable by other ways than increasing the block size, it's way preferable.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:46:12
We can - but should we? We can "force" a conflict escalation by denying to speak with anyone on the NYA list, or we can try to act reasonable, inform about the real issues, and maybe misunderstandings can clear up.
And take note: If S2X should magically win and retain the value, *we* might consider the case lost, and not worth fighting for anymore. Companies with actual paying customers, that perhaps also have customer funds stored, *will* have to make sure they don't "lose" peoples money. This might even include following a chain they don't really like - because not losing customers money trumps these issues.
I think anything that says that they won't originally relabel S2X as bitcoin but keep the original as BTC for now is slightly positive. It means they are not all in on fighting for the other side winning.

As far as I know, no. And I don't think that is fully implemented yet, either. There is a reason why LN is currently seen as unsafe, too :)
But I think that running a 3rd party watcher is going to be like a lottery with no or very small expenses. You'll basically just have to watch the blockchain, you don't need to fund it with coins from the start (all transaction fees will come from the channels you watch), and you'll get a bounty should you ever catch a cheater. If you have a server that's always on somewhere, you can just do it. You might require fees for it, but it's not going to be an expensive task, so if you take too much fee, you'll have someone underbid you. It's even conceivable that people might do it for free on the off chance that they would get a bounty.

I have the beginning in my head.
A girl, working for &lt;insert organization here&gt;, suddenly discovers that she's hunted by an unknown organization. No idea why. (yeah, sounds like a lot of books, I know :))
Towards the end of the first book, it's going to be revealed that she holds, encoded in her DNA, one out of N keys to a very large bitcoin multisig address, who was previously owned by an organization her parents (who was killed in an "accident") was part of. This was a general do-good-organization. The rest of the series will be about when she meets the other multisig-key holders (who are all conveniently working for different humanitarian organizations), and their fight against the organization that hunts them. The *character building* part of the story will be a lot about their work for the organizations.

That fee is normally way to high. Except when bitcoin cash lures away most of the miners with their (in their and our words) problematic EDA (emergency difficulty adjustment) that for a  short time makes it more profitable bitcoin cash.
See  for current fees - but take in mind that this still has a bit mining backlog, since miners only got back tonight from their latest foray into BCH world.
Unfortunate, but actually more unfortunate for BCH in the long run. They are *way* ahead in their number of scheduled blocks, a "debt" that they will have to pay back.
So we'll have to live with it for now.

Mixers might be legitime. I have this idea that I am toying with, that if I ever go creative, I'll make it "pay as you want", and in bitcoin. I'm thinking to donate part (half?) of it to charities I support.
Now, part of this is to make the addresses for payments to "me" known, so that everyone can actually see how much I got. On set dates, I will send half of it "my way", and half of it I will sell off to give to the charity. Of course, proof that I actually sold and gave it to the charity is work in progress, but at least the process can be tracked as far as this :)
Now, here comes the mixer in: I'd say it's a pretty legitimate use of a mixer to send "my" private share of it to a mixer, to make sure that noone can track it once it's out of public interest :)
But this has nothing to do with forks. Forget about that. What prevents your transaction to the "mixer" to be replayed? If anything, this sounds pretty dangerous to me :)

Short-term: Take it (at least mentally) from your holiday/FUN savings, or car-savings or whatever you want. When it has reached a sizeable growth, spend from it. And if it doubles, you can spend the same (fiat) amount again!
Spending: Spend at will, wherever possible. Replenish if necessary. These, I count as "already" spent :)

For me, I think it's pretty simple:
BTC is a new class of asset, that literally appeared over night. People are putting money "into" it, but noone knows how much each bitcoin should be worth. What we're seeing, is the market filling the bitcoin with it's true value.
The early believers are getting their reward. I wasn't that early, but I still believe in a nice reward. I think of it more as a head start to when it's more possible to rely in bitcoin usage in daily life. I'll then have more coins that I got cheaper than everyone else that will have to buy at that time if I they want "in on the fun" :)

You need to understand that there is no "right price" for bitcoin. It's simply derives it value from how much value people in total want to hold in bitcoin. If you believe that more people will buy into/use bitcoin in the future, you sort of have to believe that the price will go up too.
Where does it stop? Noone knows. When it's ubiquious? When people value all other currencies towards bitcoin (I believe this is also referred to as "the moon")?
This also depends how well we can get bitcoin to scale, and on increased utility of bitcoin. I look forward to LN, Mast, Schnorr, smart contracts, everything! Because technology is what will make bitcoin have value.

Really big returns? Maybe not 1000-folds, but I still think it has a couple doublings before we see the "final" price....
As I saw it just a very short while ago, I wanted some BTC before mass adoption, so that I got them at a discount. Doesn't matter how much, buy for as much as you are comfortable risking.
Because it *is* a risk. Even if *I* don't think it's likely, I haven't invested more than I can afford losing without affecting my life too much. If bitcoin goes to the moon, I'll be in a rather comfortable position.
But at the same time: Buying for only pocket change isn't going to give you all that much return. If you believe in it, put so much that you'll be *annoyed* if you lose it. But not enough to be a bitter grumpy man/lady :)

Everyone and their dogs are creating new coins today. How hard can it be?
Joke aside: This was in relation to a question about bitcoins ability to handle amazon getting onto bitcoin.
I pointed out that there are more ways than on-chain scaling that they could actually make it possible to spend their bitcoins there, but I was not speculating at all about the likelyhood of them adopting bitcoins...

There is nothing you can do to "get back" the fee, the transaction can not be reversed. The *only* thing you can do is to appeal to the miner to "pay it back".
Following your link, we can see that it's these guys who mined it:
But you gave them the fee, so it's up to them whether or not they will give it back to you....

What will happen, is that there will appear one or more lightning nodes for the early adopters. Whether anyone can use them or not, I have no specific guess about.
Then, there is the client side. Probably we'll have a limited selection of wallets that support Lightning, for a long time. Personally, I plan to have a "spending account" wallet, and hopefully it will support lightning - finding one that supports lightning is likely to draw me over to it. 
Whether or not my main account(s) support lightning is not so important. Any small payments will be paid from my spending account anyhow, refilled as needed from my main account (at low-traffic, low-fee times).
But the answer is: No, this will be a gradual process, not instanteous. You'll probably be able to get in a bit early if you do your research regularly.

This was with a 7 satoshis per byte fee - I doubt that has ever been "regular fee", I think it's always a bit low. Still in the queue.
It's not totally impossible that the queue clears in the next low-traffic period, if there is one. BCH has high difficulty now, hash rate is back on BTC.
As for when it will be returned, I have no specific knowledge about when it "times out"....

The transactions are too high. Everyone agrees. It's not too high for large transactions but for the small ones.
The thing everyone does not agree on, is the solution. There are layer-2-solutions like lightning (think of it as a second layer where end/intermediate nodes "guarantee" for an amount, and periodically settle what they own via the blockchain. This is highly simplified).  
Then you have those that says that all scaling should be on-chain, so we'll increase blocksize until it's enough.
Problem is: Increasing blocksize potentially makes it more expensive (in bandwith, storage, infrastructure) to participating in the process of securing the chain - and this makes it less distributed.
The disagreement is about to which extent this is a real problem, and to which extent it matters. Bitcoin core thinks it matters, and do not want to increase it more (note: segwit, that added the possibility of layer-two-scaling, was in effect an increase, and until it's more adopted we really does not see the full effect of it).
Bitcoin Cash, the fork in august, wanted larger blocks and no segwit. They have now 8 MB blocks and no segwit, but almost no usage - so they are mining mostly empty blocks anyhow.
There is a third camp, the Segwit2X camp. They want a block doubling in addition to segwit. This will - unless it is by miracle called off - do another fork in november. This fork *will* be more dangerous, and it's not totally certain what will be called bitcoin after that. Most people in this reddit sub thinks Segwit2X camp will either die off or be just another different coin.
But the gist of it: Everyone agrees this needs to be solved in the long run.
Also, note that the fees are not always that high. In a day or two, it may be possible again to have cheap and fast transaction. But at least I agree that it's too expensive with small transactions now.
Please, no politics, people! This was an attempt of a neutral, honest, non-political answer to the question :)

(Note: someone more knowledgeable than me should confirm the below :)
But if you are impatient, the do-it-yourself-way would be to move all your coins to different addresses that you control on both chains, and wait for confirmations. The point is: They can't alter your transactions, so you'll make sure it doesn't matter if it's replayed or not, because you'll get the result of the replayed transactions. Once they are on different addresses, they can't be replayed, because there will be no coins there to *spend* from on the other chain....
Personally, I plan to wait it out until I get safe tools provided from my wallet vendor.

Giving it a go:
The bitcoin you have, doesn't really reside on your disk, or in your case coinbase' disks. All that owners of bitcoin has are keys to access/use the bitcoins, but in reality all the bitcoin exists on the blockchain - i.e. distributed to the whole world. Only you can spend them if you have the keys, but if you let coinbase hold your keys, you trust that they are doing the right things with them.
For some, that is ok - but most bitcoiners advocate being in full control yourself, i.e. owning your own keys.
But owning these keys also comes with a *great* responsibility. If you lose them (there are backups, but *be sure* to understand them), you actually lose your bitcoins. Technically, they exist, but *noone* can spend them without the keys. There are no "administrators" that can go and find your bitcoins. No, really! Noone!

This! Most people that pretend to know what the bitcoin price will be are talking shit!
Sure, the technical analyis (TA) has *some* merit. I think it predicts what trading algorithms etc will do pretty accurately. I have even heard hard-die TA proponents saying that TA is even valid as fundamental things changes, it is accounted for, but that is *plain bullshit*. 
See: In bitcoin world, quite a lot is going on. What you need to decide, are:
- Do you want short-term gains? Own more dollar tomorrow because you are trading bitcoins? Then by all means, try with TA, try to predict small markets changes - but be prepared for surprises - there's *no way* TA can account for the eventuality that the Segwit2X fork is cancelled, for example.
- Do you want mid-term gains? Then, stay on top on what happens, keep your bitcoins as long as things look secure and rising, but pull out your bitcoins whenever the uncertainty becomes to high for you.
- Do you believe in the ultimate merit of bitcoin? That at the end of the day, bitcoin will increase in acceptance and usage? Then, hold on to your bitcoins. Forget the forks, forget the small dips (except if you have some extra money, take advantage of cheap bitcoins!). Because if bitcoin rises in prominence and usage, it's value *will* increase! It more or less has to.
Last, you might decide to do like I do:
- Put a moderately large amount of bitcoin on a "savings account". This is my bet on bitcoin succeeding in the future. Don't plan on sell before "half of it buys me my holiday home in Tuscany", or whenever I find my goal in life :)
- Put a bit smaller amount into your "holiday savings account". If bitcoin doubles in value, you can use half your amount and still have the money you started with here. Me, I have put enough here that a doubling or two will make a pretty decent increase in a holiday budget, but not enough to hamper next years holiday plans. I am not in line with the "put your life on hold while you wait for the bitcoin life in luxury" people, I want to also spend some of it now :) And if it takes a dip, I will live with it, and wait until next year again.
- Last: Put a moderate amount as "spending money". Use this to learn to use bitcoin? Buy someything online and discovers that you can pay with bitcoin? Use this account, don't think too much about your profit. See a pub that advertises that you can pay with bitcoin? Yay, support it! Go buy a beer, from this acccount! This is an expense already taken, you have paid it to learn about bitcoin, so in a way you are getting free beer on your "learning budget".

I made a bet on increased acceptance of bitcoins, and that it's a stayer. I didn't bet more than I can afford to lose - and I never give advice about investing more than you can afford to lose. But I invested enough that if we reach "the moon", I'll have a healthy head start on those who have to buy in when we *are* at the moon :)
For me, bitcoin is a part of my long term investments. I also have some mid-term bitcoins, that might or might not give me more money to spend on my next summer holidays. But again, if it goes to zero, I will still have enough money for the summer holidays I planned :) I don't need those this next summer, but it increases the possibility of me having more money of something *even more* exciting the summer after....
So: I bet on not short-term gains, I bet on long-term gains and also have some that I will spend in case of a mid-term gain :)

Still issues. Still things that breaks from time to time. Too tempting to upgrade to master, forgetting that adding new features often comes with a fresh set of annoying, but rarely dangerous anymore, bugs.

This article is very old, from around 1st of april, judging from the nmbers and dates in the article.
So, I will show my findings:- Each of the implementations work fairly well. There are still bugs and corner-cases found, sometimes your node crashes, and if you are unlucky it can crash in such a way that you need to patch it to get it up again. This mostly happens due to \*old\* bugs, though, and mostly on the bleeding-edge code. A more restrictive approach usually yields better stability, but on the other hand - there is rapid development and bringing in the latest improvements/fixes rapidly becomes tempting.
\- There are some interoperability problems, notably:
* c-lightning and LND have a difference in opinion as to what are the lowest safest fee, leading to c-lightning closing the channels when LND sets a fee that is too low. There are changes coming here, too, soon, and I believe it's gotten a bit better.
* Some new features gets implemented slightly differently, leading to temporally incompatibilities. The zlib-compression-handling, for example, lead to bleeding-edge LND and Eclair being incompatible for a little while.
The amount of BTC you can send in a transaction with a good probability of success is slowly increasing, due to an increasing confidence and willing to commit BTC to channels. However, transactions of 10s of dollar (n\*100000 satoshi) still have a high probability of failing). Personal experience: Yesterday I tried my highest transaction ever: 1 million satoshi. It failed to find a route. I halved it, to 500k, and it still failed. 4 transactions of 250k each went through fine, though, so the end-game was that instead of 3-4 satoshi in fee for one transaction I ended up with 10-12 satoshi for 4 transactions in total. For transferring 1M satoshi, I don't particulary care, but it was slightly cumbersome. There is a technique that will land in LND some time later this year, I believe, AMP, that will automate this: Splitting up a transaction in smaller transactions and have them being sent atomically (i.e. either all fails or all succeed).  
We're still lacking watchtowers, which means that receiving when you're not running your node at least once a day is slightly unsafe. Any theft because of this likely have to be planned, and isn't \*dead\* easy to do. This is the main reason mobile version of LND is not yet here, and that Eclair Android wallet cannot receive LN transactions. There is another wallet, Bitcoin Lightning Wallet, that have opted for enabling receiving still.   
As seen on [ number of places that you can use LN is steadily increasing. And my personal feel is that the speed in this is increasing. I have seen a lot of places pop up in june.  
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:06:07
Look, there's no way I will ever try to convince someone to buy bitcoin. It'll have to be their own decision. I can explain to them the cryptographic properties, the fact that there will ever be 21, the fact that it'll be easier to transact with LN and that we're only in the start - but they'll have to do the math themselves - if they believe it's a scam, it's their right to believe so. If they believe it's going to go up short term, that has to be \*their\* reasoning, not mine. If they believe it's going to go up long-term, I believe that's pretty correct, that's the future I believe in (short-term doesn't matter), but I still won't try to convince anyone.  
I'll explain to them why I believe it. I might help them with practical things and understanding. But I don't know the future.

This can actually be a business idea for traditional banks as they mature to the idea of bitcoin. At least one of the banks here in Norway have enough acceptance for bitcoin that they're letting their customers keep track of their bitcoin portfolio through them, but they want keep or let you buy bitcoin through them just yet.
Not that *I* would want anyone else but me keep my private key. But say they have a HSM for bitcoin private keys, and give each owner their own public key, it won't be all *that* bad.
They could also be the second signer in 1-of-2 multisig-account, and function as a bitcoin recovery service.
There's plenty of room in the "services around bitcoin" space. The point, however, is that if you know what you're doing, you can elect not to use them and do it all yourself.

I just bought 100 tickets for 200000 satoshi, sent in one transaction. Unfortunately my price was only 223875 - but I managed both to send and withdraw 200k without problems, and now I have 23k play money :)  
There's not a lot of people playing raffle, so statistically I did have a very good chance to win :)  There's some earning opportunity here, someone else could have earned my 200k satoshi. I'll be sure to play more to test liquidity more :)

First: The old travelling salesman problem. It's extremely effective to refute.  
Let's use travelling salesmen as an example. It's pretty good - even though my refution will be a bit simplified. It \*basically\* says that it's impossible to find the optimal route for salesmen to travel.  
Yet: Salesmen travel all the time. Why do they do that when they can't find the optimal route?  
It's actually pretty simple: It doesn't have to be optimal. It just have to  be good enough. It's the \*same\* with LN transactions. If you pay 10000 satoshi, would you care whether you pay 4 or 6 satoshi in fees? probably not a whole lot.  
The rest isn't really about Lightning, but I'll try refute some of it anyhow. Most of it is sort of vague and full of non-educated opinions.
Then, there is all this "fractional reserve" stuff.  It basically takes a hated word and redefines it to fit something that is related to Segwit. But it of course has not anything to do with fractional reserve whatsoever.  The scaling problem is hard, I'll agree to that. But I, and a lot of other people, believe the most important thing is keeping things off the blockchain  so that it won't increase indefinitely.  
\- LN is creating a system making sure your coffee cup spendings are always possible in a secure manner even when fees on the main-chain are expensive.
\- Sidechains (liquid etc) are a solution to give the business segment a way to transfer bitcoin offchain. A sidechain can be said to be a settlement layer. It does make sense to get heavy volumes into a settlement model, leaving blockchain for interactions with the settlement systems and then some transactions for the personal user segment.  
Then there is the non-mining node stuff.  He is plain wrong. It's true that you are increasing mainly your own security. But it \*is\* important that enough people validate the security of their transactions. It's what bitcoin is about.  If noone validates that miners are honest, we are trusting them \*way\* too much. Now, I have tried debating this with supporters of on-chain scaling claming non-mining nodes are bad for the network....the answers are kind of circular. The arguments basically are that "no miner will ever do that, because other miners will stop them from do it". Guess what: Big blocks increases the incentives for staying with the large pools (or increases the disadvantage by not being with them). Which means that bigger blocks lead to fewer = larger mining pools. We already have times where a minng pool get &gt;50&amp; hash rate temporary. This will increase if block size increases, and it will also lead to other people dropping running their own node.  
Now, I have tried debating this. Most people think that once a block is on the blockchain, everything is fine and settled. It's not. There is still the economic aspect, \*someone\* decides what the value is. And who does that? If you sell coffee for bitcoin, you are part of it. Maybe not a large part, but still a part. With a full node, you \*will\* be able to call miners out if they should change the protocol, not do their job (by not verifying signatutes (something that will get computationally more expensive, of course, the bigger the blocks and the more signatures there is in a block), or other malicious things. Your node will say "that's not bitcoin!", and they'll walk away without the coffee.  
If you add that up to \*everywhere\* you can spend/sell bitcoin, you get the financial valuation of a coin. Without that, it's just bits on a computer. We need those giving value to a coin to validate the security as independently as possible. \*That's\* financial security for you.  
The last argument, however, is the most hilarious. It's basically a praise of Craighs "more secure exchanges", with split keys/shared custody models of exchanges. It's pretty hilarious preaching virtues of shared custody in some solutions and then critizising Lightning Network of being "custodial solutions" when it's more or less the \*same\* model. In the first, the "more secure exchanges" arguments, they say that it now makes "bitcoin on exchanges under your control again". While on the LN network, they say that you now have given up control to third-parties that can "lock up your money forever" while it's simply shared control over multisig-wallets on the blockchain! Now, \*that's\* some quality double standards coming out of the community.

Take note: if you do something wrong with your one wallet, I.e. fail to protect it, lose it and don't have backup, you can also lose your coins totally - to the point that it is 100% impossible to get them back. 
The general idea of holding your keys yourself may be sound, but can lead to disaster if you don't know what you are doing.
If you go this way, make sure  you learn how to use it, how to secure it and how to take backup and restore before you move much coin there.

Bying bitcoin is still sort of expensive.
I have now ended up with the following, for non-urgent payments:

2) SEPA to Bitpanda EUR wallet. Usually next day, no fee.
3) Buy bitcoin from EUR wallet on Bitpanda - around 2% fee.
For urgent payments, I guess I'd just use my Revolut card instead of doing SEPA/EUR wallet, but for that Bitpanda charges more.

Noone knows what the "ultimate" value of bitcoin is. I like to think of the bitcoin price as "the total amount of value people want to put in bitcoin, divided by the number of bitcoins". We know the last value, but not the first.
Now, there's tons of "money" in the world. Some of it is invested in gold, some of it in perceived stable but ultimately risky USD og EURO. Some in dubious derivatives, and some in even more shitty investments. A lot of this money can be moved into bitcoin. Whether or not it does depends on the trust in bitcoin. Do we believe in the security, acceptance and utility of bitcoin in the future? If the answer is yes, bitcoin will grow.
There's lots of room for bitcoin to grow in value. We know it can mostly only do it by each bitcoin being more worth. There's not going to be a whole lot more of bitcoins.
If you believe in this, and you believe in value of bitcoin as "first mover and most accepted so far", you'll hold on to your bitcoins.
But be prepared: If sentiment turns, and bitcoin is regarded as another shitty investment, it might decrease in value. Fast. But I don't think it will, by this time. It is gradually gaining acceptance.

There are major signs that part of the high fee problem was \*actually\* manipulation - done by big block supporters with lots of money. I haven't seen conclusive proof, though, but I did see a lot of transactions I couldn't see any apparent purpose for - like transacting back and forth between the same set of addresses.
I fully agree that the most important work is to make sure block size is not increased unneeded. If that means keeping some transactions off-chain, I am pretty good with that, as long as they are ultimately tied to the BTC chain - like in LN and sidechains.

Exchanges to buy bitcoin usually demands passport and a photo of yourself plus blood from your firstborn. Ok, maybe not the last, but almost.

Liquid, Rootstock, drivechains and sidechains and lightning network is not about scaling the blockchain. It's about moving things that does not need to be settled immediately away from the blockchain but still having the value pegged to the blockchain.  
In a way it's scaling, but in another way it's about reducing need for scaling.

BTC holders are not against larger blocks, they are against short-sighted changes. We are in the process of implementing segwit, and if people could stop wasting resources on the forks and go write segwit support, this is an effective increase in block size.
There are lightning implementation in alpha stage. While it requires trusted third partys, it will allow off-chain scaling. I personally think this is something you will pay for your coffee with, and perhaps also larger stuff, i.e. "over-the-counter" stuff and dealing with people you have a customer/partner relationship with.
Keep in mind: Lightning is not a replacement of on-chaint transactions, it's an addition. You need it to be recorded in the blockchain? Pay a premium fee for that service. If not, use lightning. That premium fee will also in theory decrease with increased segwit and LN usage.
Is this not enough? Out of options? Let's increase block size! But let's test the other exciting things first. They are being developed, and are on their way!

I run LND on an XU4. There's CPU usage, but after the initial startup sync, it's not \*that\* high. I also got a heatsink version, and haven't really had any issues with Do you have any memory left? Swapping can be a bitch if it happens. And I know that bitcoind at least during a sync can eat a lot of memory. What I did was just restart bitcoind after it had finished syncing.

Myself, I have bought something for holding and something for spending. Now, timing for the spending purchase was a bit unfortunate, so currently I am at loss--&gt;I don't spend.
But once it goes above the purchase price, I plan on spending from it - and replenishing - in a scheme that it's likely that (thinking FIFO) the bitcoins I spend was bought a bit cheaper than when I spend them.
That way, I can use bitcoin and gain money on it, too. I always remind myself that this was money I was going to spend - now, I'm getting more from them.
This of course depends on the price going up - something I'm sort of confident it will do in the long run.

Sure, you can buy whatever amount you want. Different exchanges have their own limits, of course, but one bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshi, which means that 1 satoshi is worth less than 1/100 cent.  
The real "hassle" is that most of the exchanges there require cumbersome ID verification, but nothing impossible to go through.  
Also, note that there's no "official price of bitcoin", rather the price is the average of what people are willing to pay for bitcoin. Different exchanges give different prices. There's also going to be fees that are different from exchange to exchange.
Many beginners seem to start with coinbase. These days my favourite is bitstamp, [

@_date: 2017-10-26 13:42:07
It is safe to spend/use it up to the fork. Should probably stop a few days before the fork
The estimate for the split, you can see here:
The reason for stopping a few days before, is that if your transaction takes long time (i.e. the mempool is full), it might not be included in a block before the split, and that is unsafe - at least with the information we have at the point I am writing this.
Also - days before the split, there is a risk that a lot of people might want to move their coins for some reason or another. Some people will move their coins out of exchanges, for security reasons, some people will try to move their coins *to* the exchanges that have promised to give you new coins early.
Try not to compete with them. It will both be expensive and (possibly) unsafe because of risk of delays.
If you look at  to see how fast transactions with various fees are going through. It might be good to learn how to read that chart - it might even save you something on fees in the long time, because wallets often overestimates the fees just to be safe. But, around/before the split: Do *not* try to pay too low fees to let your transactions linger too much/over the split!

Personally, I treat my crypto more or less them same way as everything else I own.
I have some BTC that is my savings account. All the way to the moon and all that, but not necessarily beyond. Everone should have a moon, some goal for their savings. Also in crypto.
I also have a short-term savings account. With a nice return here, I can sell off some of it and have a better vacation next year.
Last, but not at all least, I have a spending account. Do I spend? Hell yeah! Every time.
I have tested moneni.com, won 0.01 BTC and lost all of it again. I have bought coffee, crypto stuff, Arduino stuff for my GFs christmas sweater.Noadays, these funds are in my Lighting Node, where it has so far brought me several 100...satoshi in routing fees! But it's adoption! I use it like it's meant to be used.
Like any spending account, sometimes it may need refilling, though. So I buy at times, too.
@_date: 2018-07-19 06:31:00
Lightning is not going to replace onchain totally. For your use case right now, I would probably recommend the  previously mentioned  to have it swapped to an onchain payment. Btw you can do the same from your own wallet so that you get receive capacity.
In the future we need services like this to open channels to us when they need to pay us, or offer onchain payments in addition to LN. We are in a bit of a hype phase now where people try to solve everything with LN.
But you can't currently open a channel to BLW or any other mobile wallet, really, since it doesn't expose its ip on public internet. This is of course theoretically possible to solve in other ways, for example you could  initiate the connection and lightningspin could open the channel. On LND this is two distinct steps.
 
@_date: 2018-07-13 08:08:32
I emntally divide my bitcoin into a long term savings account, a short term savings account and a spending account.,  
My long term savings account will stand until I reach \*my\* moon. I totally expect to cash out, some day. But not this year and not next year. And this is independent on price, because I believe in BTC long term.  
Then I have a short term savings account. From this, I'll liquidite some profit, but not so much that the fiat value of it depletes over time. This means that I currently hold also this one. I could have sold some, but as I currently don't need the money, I'm gonna allow them to grow.See last point, I believe this to be a pretty low price.  
The third lot of BTC is my spending account. From here, I spend. My LN node (and mobile LN wallet) is funded from this one. I might also from time to time have to buy more BTC to refill it, should I spend too much.

Fluctuation in crypto is a sign we are not nearly mature as a currency yet. LN and all other protocol enhancements in and on top of bitcoin will go hand in hand with speculation and fluctuation, also called "price discovery".
Let me give you a no nonsense example of price discovery. Last year, we topped out at approximately $20k late december. This year, a lot of people will be aware of this. They'll be dead sure that they won't do the same mistake in next bull run. This might stop price increase and make price go down again, but if it doesn't it is a very strong sign that the real value of BTC should actually be higher.
Right now, a lot of people is sitting and waiting for the bull run. They'll not belive in it before BTC is well above $10k. If we reach another top, and it goes down again, we'll have a lot of people that will remember this. they'll  be determined not to lose the next bull run, and buy in above the bottom of this one.
This will in turn make the volatility lower, and a price increase combined with more people aboard would in addition make price less prone to changes because of this. It simply will take more money changing hands to create the same swings in percentage.
We are going to be in discovery phase for a bit longer, and use this time to build infrastructure.
*then* BTC will be ready to be used as a currency.

There is a slack where a lot of the people testing on mainnet hangs out. Also on IRC. This is what's happening. Of course, it's not a necessity that you know who your channel partners are, but in reality a lot of the network building right now is happening with some degree of cooperation because we'd prefer to know whether or not the partner is running mature software, are running a "permanent" node or just testing, etc...
One of his channels was with my node, and I gave him back hist money in the channel same day. I believe he has now set up a new node, though, so I should have waited, and just used it as a push amount creating a new channel to him. A few people have done that.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:38:34
Yes. I see what you mean. But I don't think you can get people to continue paying higher fees for idealistic reasons.
And yes: I do agree with the Core view that blockchain space should have a cost. But until second layers is a viable alternative for most people, those who want to spend coins will use Segwit, because it's the most economic alternative.

None of them should be stuck for 12 hours.
What I have seen happen often is that someone spend unconfirmed output that was much lower, so they can't get them through before the parent transaction goes through. That would pretty much mean something like 2 sat/b now,  because  blocks now eat from the 1-2 sat/b segment
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:11:29
Can't be done. If they want to implement it, noone can deny them. And some noise on reddit won't do any good either too or from.
But if LN is implemented, BCHs value propositions: "Cheap and instant transactions with bitcoin" becomes not unique anymore, and they dwindle into an etheral life as an altcoin with little unique features. A little like now, in other words.
I can live with that.
@_date: 2018-07-12 04:59:47
You need a channel to receive Lightning Payments. Currently on mobile wallets, you'll have to create that channel yourself. When you create a channel, you have to fund it, and right now, that means you'll have to have BTC in the wallet before creating the channel.  
\- Channel creation can be seen as two steps. LND for example makes this pretty explicit, you first connect (open a TCP connection), then you create the channel. It would of course be feasible to open a channel from your mobile to a node, and have that node open/fund a channel to you. Afaik noone has yet implemented this.
There's as far as I know, nothing fundamentally wrong with having the funds come from another wallet than the LND wallet. A funding of a channel consist of moving coins into a multisig channel.

The smart contract that the pre-signed force-close tx that Alice can broadcast, is set up like this:  
Bob can spend his share at once.
Alices share can be spent in two ways:
1) After the timelock has passed, Alice can move them.
2) Before the timelock, Bob can use the revocation transaction he was given in the next lightning transaction to move Alices funds to himself.  
Yes, you read it correct: By publishing an old commitment transaction, she essentially gives those coins to Bob, providing his node provides the fraud transaction.  
Any node will watch for older commitment transactions from its channels, and watchtowers will be the last part of the game theory:  
Alice might for example know that Bobs node belongs to a company in the area of a natural disaster, making it unlikely that it comes back online before this timelock has passed. But she can not know whether he uses a watchtower, and/or where this watchtower is. It is still totally not safe to publish an old commitment transaction.

BCH can scale perfectly in a lab, with decent servers and dedicated GB links between them. So, if you leave out decentralization, you can scale on BCH.  
Disk space is cheap. Bandwith isn't that expensive, unless you need \*many\* powerful links.  
The \*real\* problem is the decentralization. And let's leave out the non-mining full nodes for a second and concentrate only on miners.  
When a block is found, you (or your pool) obviously  have the information and the transactions immediately, and can start mining on top of it. Any other entity will mine on old information until the new block is received \*and\* validated. Yah, each and every transactions will have to be validated again, this is part of the incentive mechanisms.  
Now, the larger a block is, the larger both the transfer time and the TX validation time gets. Moores law will help a bit, but \*not enough\*. Relying on Moores law is also quite risky.  
Now, which pool will be at an advantage most time? The \*largest\* pool of course. And the larger the block are, the greater this advantage is.  
So, let's say I want to get into mining. I do my reseach, see which mining operation works best, i.e. has the lowest orphan rate, the largest number of blocks per hashrate, etc. And I find that the largest pool gives me much better return for my hash rate! Who do I join? You got it - I join the largest pool, who now got even larger and have a greater advantage!  
So, this leads to mining centralization. To some extent, this pressure will always be there, but smaller blocks makes this much less evident. And no, graphene etc only helps a bit when it comes to mining (although it helps much more for non-mining nodes).  
So, let's take non-mining nodes. They are mostly important for yourself, but as a collective they are a \*very\* big part of the incentive for miners to do their job, and to not do unilateral changes to the protocol. Remember: We're already getting centralized, and some collution here is very possible.   
So how does a non-mining node help here? He's giving value to coins! If I sell coffee for bitcoin, I and only I decide whether or not your bitcoins are worth my coffee. This \*is\* part of valuation, in the same way that trading in exchanges is.  So, let's say the mining pool having 55&amp; hash rate skimps on their job? Well, their transactions won't validate! If the rest of the full nodes says those blocks are invalid, then they \*are\* worth zero. Miners' income comes from selling coins, they need to do that sooner or later to pay their bills.  
The 45&amp; miners that still produces valid coins will be able to sell coins. Congratulations! We have now a hard fork! Eventually, if the majority chain continues to mine invalid blocks that everyone else discards, the difficulty on the 45&amp; chain will have a difficulty adjustment, and will now produce more blocks again, and their income normalizes. The 55&amp; chain can become irrelevant, if everyone else stays honest and reject their work.  
So, keeping it cheap to run a full node means more of economic activity are validated through independent full nodes, thus decreasing the possible income for dishonest miners!  This is all part of bitcoins incentive mechanisms.  
So, what's worst case? A few very large mining pools and almost no independent nodes. We now have a censorable infrastructure, and one that have fewer participants and more \*customers\*. Because that is what centralizaton leads to: Providers and customers, instead of economic actors that depend upon each others.

The individual channel liquidities are not fully available, only the total in the channel. The routing is a bit probabilistic - which is fine, because a node can immediately try a different route if it fails through the first. This happens all the time now on the network. Each node implementation will set its own limit as to when to give up trying to find a new route.
There can also be some amount of learning here. If I know that I failed paying 1M satoshi through that route 10 minutes ago, I don't have to try it again. This was a bit simplistic example, but you get what I mean.

...and if you didn't write them down, you should actually *right* now create a new wallet, write down the *new* seed words, and transfer all of your coins there.
If you just created the bitcoin wallet on the phone and have no backup of it, and you lose/destroy the phone, your bitcoins are gone. As in forever. A lot of people does not totally grasp this.

Slightly wrong.
When you send your payment, every node on the way knows exactly 3 things:
1. The amount to forward
2. The previous node id (and IP)
3. The next node id (and IP)
No node on the way knows which hop is the final one - except of course the final one. No node on the way knows which node sent it - not even the destination node. He can only see that the invoice gets paid, and over which of his incoming channels.

Estimating where bitcoin will "end" in value is not magical. Bitcoins value comes from how much money people want to invest in bitcoin.

Anything where you control your own keys are better than keeping them on an exchange.
How do you know if you control your own keys? If you, during setup, had to "backup" something, usually a set of words, then you have what you need to recreate the key, possibly also in another type of wallet.
Electrum is an SPV wallet. This means that you have to make sure that the node it "runs towards" is also not spending your coins on the wrong chain. But you own your keys, so:
- coins from both chains are safe *until* you decide to spend them after the fork.
- you will be able to claim coins from any of the forks, eventually - assuming both forks still exists, of course! This step needs *a lot* of carefulness, but having them in a wallet where you own the keys pretty much guarantees that this is possible.

I have a more dualistic view.
I have a "savings account" that is for long term savings. This, I will not spend until it buys me my vacation home in Tuscany (my current goal, it might change ;))
Then, I have a short-term savings account. This one, I'll probably spend part of already next summer - barring a price crash. This one I paid from my "vacation savings" bank account, but it's my hope that it'll grow and I'll be a bit closer to realizing the safaris in Tanzania, the 4 weeks hiking in Nepal and other stuff that is on my plan ;)
Third, I have a spending account. And it's exactly this: Spendings account. This one is mine to play with, and I fill it up from my bank spendings account when it gets emptier.

"Following the longest chain" is for them a way of saying "we will go along with who wins, and will not go along backing 'the loser'". They're trying to provide their customers with reassurance. Not us redditors. Which may or may not be the same people.
But we're seeing more people saying they'll call the original chain BTC, and noone except the hardcore segwit2x people declares outright that segwit2x is bitcoin. This is a slightly positive sign, imho, and we need to provide reassurance to those who says they will following the longest chain.

I could extremely easily code up a blacklist, making sure that node is not used in \*any\* transactions I use.  
But routing through him isn't dangerous, as LN channels are created trustless.  
If he wants to create LN channels to learn about LN, we're good. If he wants to write reviews, I'm good with that too. LN needs both positive and negative critisism to get better. I personally hope he'll be neutral and come up with a balanced review - constructive critisism helps LN. There's tons of propaganda against LN, so another unbalanced review isn't going to break LN.

You don't have to move to Segwit, but:
- Segwit will give you smaller fees now
- Segwit is also where all the new transaction improvements are due to happen -like Schnorr, MAST and other stuff. This will also result in lower fees.
- To use LN, you'll need Segwit. But granted, this means that it's not unlikely that you'll move some funds to another wallet at that point, unless Nano S imolements LN.
My recommendation: Follow  and wait for the new low-fee period if you want to move the funds to Segwit. Lately, we have had a lot of time where 1 sat/b will put you in the next block or at least pretty close to.

LN is peer to peer. Anyone is a node. Anyone can route. Just as with.torrents. and in a way the economics in LN is a bit like wjth torrents. Anyone just serving things to others without also getting benefits thrmselves are losing out.

[ show the true story. Basically, mempool is fine. We have someone generating a lot of 1 sat/b transactions.   
Cost and speed is totally related. If I was in a hurry, I'd pay 6 sat/b now - or maybe even more if I really needed certainty to be in next block. If I just wanted to get into a block within a few hours, I'd stick with 2 sat/b. Even all the 1 sat/b transactons will confirm, so if I was doing a transaction that was not urgent at all, I could say 1 sat/b.

You can do it risk-free on the test-net, but a fair warning: Test-net is actually in a worse state than prod today, I feel. I know that I for one neglect my test-node, and have even been so lazy that I patch prod without first patching test, because I have seen others that have tested the patches.
I would recommend playing around a bit on the test-net if you want to experiment and understand it. LND and most other command-line-based tools have a learning curve, but some of the mobile nodes are pretty beginner-friendly - but less powerful and gives less opportunity for learning the details.
Once getting the hand of it, fund it with as much as you are comfortable after having studied it. I am not into propaganda, so I will not tell you that it is *100%* safe - nothing is and it is still pretty new tech - but things are improving rapidly. I'd not bet my life savings on it, any more than I would walk around with my life-savings in my wallet :)
Can it be used today? Lots of people do. I do recommend trying at this point. I did start playing on testnet around christmas and was ready for beta when it was launched in march. My reason? I am in this for the tech, I am comfortable being an early adopter, and I want to learn LN as it grows, and not waiting until someone says "it's finished". Nothing really is ever finished before it's dead.

1) Yes, and no. There will always be a need of non-lightning transactions, and if on-chain transactions become "too cheap", people are going to start use that again more often instead of lightning. Another fear people actually have, is that there will not be any blockspace for "everyone in the world to be able to open/close as many channels as they want", which is more or less the opposite fear. I would believe this to balance out, in the end.
2) They can try. In reality, I think they can't really succeed in regulating anything other than the interactions  between fiat and crypto.
3) No speculations here... :) But part of the security of the blockchain actually lies in the guarantee that someone needs to use a shitload of money==energy to "rewrite the history".
4) Some people think so. I think it won't take over gold's role just yet, but it will supplement it.

There will obviously be a fee market also in LN - but as the margin cost for one transaction really approaches 0, there's no reason it should ever
become expensive.  
What I can see happening, is that the base fee will always be 1 satoshi (per routing hop). That way, true microtransactions will always be cheap. There is, however, another parameter, the feerate. It is proportional to the amount transacted. In LND, I think it defaults to 1/1M, so you'd have to transfer 1M satoshi before it becomes 1 satoshi extra. Transferring a transaction of 1M satoshi over 10 hops (which is  pretty large number of hops,I include it as sort of "worst case"), you'd have 2\*10 = 20 satoshi - which is insignificant. If you increase the feerate by multiplying it by 10, the same transaction would cost you 11\*10 = 110 satoshi - which is pretty small for such a large transaction. Even multiplying it by 100, you'd only get up to 1010 satoshi to transfer 1M satoshi - which is approximately 0.1 percent in fee - pretty decent still.  
I think small transactions will remain very cheap, but we can easily see larger transactions costing more money. At 10M satoshi (0.1 BTC), we might start to see that LN is not strictly economical anymore, and on-chain can be cheaper.  I think this how it should be.

The question doesn't really make sense. If  you and I have a channel, we can transact back and forth all day long without the network knowing. Likewise if A and C transact through B, only two channels will know about this.

I bought a very small mining contract a few months back. Mostly because I wanted to see that part of it.
So far I am about half way to profit in USD, about a 1/3rd in  bitcoin. And I have automatic withdrawals, so I know they are not just telling me I will get bitcoin :)
I believe I will reach profit in USD,  but have my doubts about the bitcoin profit. 
So: for profit, go with just buying bitcoins. If you want to "see" part of the mining without buying equipment, go ahead. But do some research in to which one first. And choose one where they have a portal where you can see what is going on, Else there is no point :). You will probably reach Fiat profit, likely not bitcoin.

Right now, we're in the place where the core protocol is more or less safe, but there's still edge-case bugs, and things that doesn't work as well as they should, leading to transactions not being sent to the blockchain because of fee issues, Transactions getting stuck and channels getting force-closed for security reasons, etc. In addition, watch towers isn't completely finished - though a lot of watch tower related PRs are merged in LND nowadays - so it's up to yourself and only you to provide security against people submitting old channels states. This isn't particuarly worrysome for server-side lightning nodes, but it is the main reason why Eclair doesn't have receive capability yes.  
After watch towers, we'll see Atomic Multipath Payments - the possibility to split up payments in smaller chunks. This will help  a lot on the probability to get a large payment done.  
After that, I have no specific knowledge - but there's going to be work on:  
\- eltoo - a new type of channel "consensus", getting rid of a lot of the penalty stuff. This is peer-to-peer, and can be rolled out gradually as nodes start to support it.  
\- Newer routing protocols. This will also be a gradual roll-out, there's no need for all nodes to calculate routes the same way.  
Longer term, there's a possibility of someone actually implementing channel factories.

It is finite in the same way (maybe more so) that gold are finite. There also exists other things we put value in, like silver. But still, people differentiate between gold and silver, and the value has nothing to do with other things, any more, than what people want to pay  for them. Bitcoin gains value the same way. There exists also litecoin and other, but clearly they are not the same as people put different value on them.

While the bug was serious enough in itself, no need to add half-truths to it.  
What happens in an LN-payment, is that balances shift - starting with closest to the payee. Then, each node that has settled the balance in their outgoing channel in the payment can settle with the incoming channel - but also have enough information to settle on-chain, should the node on the incoming channel have gone away, or fail to cooperate.  
What happened in this bug, is that node implementations failed to validate the properties of the actual funding transactions, but took the negotiated contract metadata as good proof.  
I, myself, have now run the tool provided by lightning labs, [ on my node that was upgraded even before the existence of this bug was known to the public.  
It provided the assurance I needed, \*all\* my channels are ok.  
Now, but wait a minute - can I not get "fake" bitcoin from somewhere else?  
No, I can not. My channels are all ok. I only need to validate my own channels, what happens in other peoples channels are of no concern to me.  
All of bitcoin is like this. Being your own bank comes with responsibilities - you need to keep up to date with security of the tools you are using.  
Was it a bad bug? Definitely. When could you upgrade? End of july is when LND 0.7.1 was released, and this is when I upgraded to it. I knew nothing about this bug then, but I know that a ton of bugs are fixed at each release, so I upgraded - as everyone should do when bugfix releases are released.

It's outsourcing. For some, it makes sense. Some people want to take crypto but need to liquidate at once because they don't want to deal with the liquidity.

It's not particulary risky at this moment. Sure, payments fails at times, but this does not mean you lose the money.  
I think you have it wrong, though. You don't have to empty the channel to receive. You will, however, not allow a channel partner to send you \*all\* his funds. You could easily have withdrawn most of it, though. This is a problem that will hit newbies in LN for sure, but it will get better as you have used LN for a while - and possibly have more channels that can be used.

Yes, I agree :) But bitcoin *is* still considered risky. If it was not, then why would it have volatility and it's still not on the moon? If it was not risky, buying it would be a no-brainer.
Of course, part of the non-acceptance is based on lack of knowledge. We have more knowledge, so we can be early adoptors, and we, as in bitcoin community, rate the risk lower than the rest of the world. But we do run the risk of being overconfident...this is why I put the "never invest more than I would be fine with going to 0".

The problem here is trust. I'd be more than happy to trade with you for any *non-reversable* payment method, or you'd have to wait with getting the bitcoin until your money are *in my hand*.
But why should you trust that I give you those BTC?
 is a ranking-based peer-to-peer marketplace that solves some of these issues. Other than using traditional fiat-based and totally reversable ways to transfer payments, it also provides the service of announcing bitcoin for physical cash - so that you can find the closest person doing that. Be aware that these are actually premium services, you're probably going to get bitcoin cheaper through a normal exchange, especially if you transfer money to them before the trade. Credit card purhaces is actually a bit expensive, usually.

He will have to use  large slightly longer route this time. Fees will be used to incentivize here. Fee properties can be set per channel.

I wish physics were different. I truly do. I do wish that I also had that much believe in un unlimited Moores law that you can scale on-chain , promising next-block TX for almost free, forever.
However, I don't. I truly believe that the only way to have a decentralized, blockchain-based currency scaling world wide, is to try to *limit* the size of blocks, the size of the blockchain, lowering the bar to run a full node and actually validating yourself that the blocks are, indeed, *valid*. The more people who can and do that, the *more* decentralized and the more "secure" it is, financially. We need Moores law in addition, but we can *not* scale *more* than Moores law. Some people seem to believe that Moores law is unlimited.
In that regards, we need LN.
But regardless of that, LN *is* actually useful even if you don't believe it's needed for *scaling*. Why? Because it's a multi-sig version of 0-conf! It's a more secure version of 0-conf, in fact it's so secure that you don't *actually* have to even submit it before you need to, you can safely wait and see if either party wants to update the amount transacted.
In fact, it's so secure that you can build a network out of such contracts, having them atomically updated over several hops.
That is cool.
We can't really build that on-chain without creating centralized solution. I know there are speculations that LN will be centralized too, but even if that is the case, it is a magnitude much less worse with a centralized layer two than a centralized base layer.

There *is* a few annoying interoperability problems at the moment. I am sure they will be solved.
Warning: This is seen from the point of view of LND, you might want to hear the annoyances seen from the point of view of c-lightning before you decide :)
The problems are mainly about how c-lightning handles renegotioation of parameters - the commitment fee (the few set aside for a force-close, should it happen) being the most important). Whenever LND proposes one that c-lightning finds outside it's acceptable view, c-lightning force-closes the channel.
LND to LND. I see things working mainly as they should, nowadays. Smaller issues are fixed rapidly. I am sure the same can be said c-lightning to c-lightning.
*My* impression is that LND is a bit more mature than c-lightning - but I have heard from people in the c-lightning camp that things is getting much better there too, and they might launch their "beta" version in not *too* long.

Both of them have a little low fees for the current time. Based on the experience from lately, most likely they will confirm within a few more hours. The last one perhaps quite soon.

LN is by no means mandatory - but it is a response to the
realization that block space has to have a cost, and it's
not going to be a goal that all small payments can get on-chain space almost for free. The reason for this is that
running full nodes cost money, and contrary to some other
popular opinion in the BCH camp, full nodes do contribute.
It does mostly contribute to your *own* security, though,
but that economic activity takes place and is validated
by other nodes than the mining nodes *is* a large part
of the incentives to keep miners honest.
So: We do not want to push too many economic actors away from running full nodes. It leads to centralization.
And it will centralize around a few miners, and that is
not good for the core properties: uncensorable,
But there's noone that force you to use LN. There will always be on-chain. Keeping on-chain almost free will,
simply just not be a priority.

Do not listen to the BCH camp. Information there is not trustworthy when it comes to anything they see as "competition". There's tons of propaganda coming out of that camp.
That said, there are still bugs and still work to be done. There's not a ton of money in channels yet, either, and it can be difficult to actually pay for thing costing in the 10s of dollars unless you have direct channels :) This will, of course, correct as people gain more trust. There is also solutions that will be implemented that will make it possible to split up payments sent different ways, but that's a while until it gets here, I believe.
There's still incompatibility issues between different implementations. c-lightning doesn't like it when a node like LND proposes a low "commit fee" (which is the agreed upon and set-aside fee that should be used for force-closing channel, should it be necessary), c-lightning just says "no way!" and force-closes. These are things that will be ironed out, of course.
You can try for yourself. At this stage, I'd still recommend doing mistakes on testnet, should you decide to do any :)

First: Since Eclair can only send, noone can actually steal your funds anyhow. It is safe to open to any node you want.
That said: 
I think it does make sense to open the first channel to a vendor you will transact often with. A vendor will also have most incentive to keep nodes up/stable, have good liquidity, etc.
The big issue at this point, I guess, is liquidity. If all Eclair users connect to ACINQ, they'll end up eating the liquidity in ACINQs outgoing channels. ACINQ might of course try to counter this, but I guess the best strategy is to have a mix of channels. 2-3 at first?
I'll PM you my node id, if you want to connect. I do have some outgoing channels with a bit of liquidity, and will only promise that i try running a stable and good node :)

I love how the goal posts move, really.
It is moved from "LN will never be released" to "A perfect routing algorithm will not be possible".
The latter, I actually agree with. But it is also a goal that doesn't matter. We only need a good enough routing algorithm, and *that* is possible. Example: Would you care whether tx fee is 14 or 12 satoshi?

We can't just dismiss all the NYA companies. A lot of them is just trying to keep the value for their customers. We can't *really* expect them to risk the value of their customers funds.
What we need to do, is provide them assurance. I believe the Segwit2X failure is not that guaranteed yet that it's seen as "safe" to just dismiss it winning.
We also need to be better at explaining why it is actually important. Why do we need decentralization? Visa and Mastercard is almost dead stable with centralization, so why is decentralization so important? We need to explain this in a better way - why it's important that organizations like Wikileaks can get funding even if we fundamentally disagree with some of it. Why it's important that people in less-connected countries can run their full nodes and be a *part* and not just a customer of bitcoin.
I didn't fully appreciate this either, until recently. But I do now. I am willing to live with occational high fees for a bit, while we evaluate other scaling options.

Lightning is not a replacement for on-chain transactions, and will not immediately solve all problems - there's going to be tradeoffs, and new things to learn. And yes, you'll need incoming balance, on the remote side of the channel, to receive. There's several ways to get that, including solutions where you open up a channel and transfer out of it to somewhere else. There's going to be atomic swap services for things like this, but right now you can do this in a trustful way - at [  
You can also have [lightningconductor.net]( open an incoming channel to you, for example - or someone else, including the party that needs to pay you. As a beginner, this is probably a hurdle, but it'll become less of a problem later. Most people do, in fact, spend more than they receive. And the rest can be expected to learn more :)
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:37:21
There needs to be support in the wallet for RBF, and you need to choose that it should be possible to replace it by RBF when you send it. There's good reasons for that, because there are people who accept things as paid even when it's only submitted, like you have done now.
No confusion here :)

It's more the psychological effect. These are coins the world has started counting on not moving. It's more than 5 % of BTC existing. Were some of them to move, it would be like suddenly we had an instant influx of 5%. Won't kill the price, I guess, but It's be more than 5% noticeable :)

Well. If fees are basically the same (with lightning), *most* people will choose to hold the gold-standard of crypto. This might easily cause people not having to use alts to pay because it's cheaper.
I think that is just as likely a possibility.

@_date: 2018-04-06 13:07:08
Sure, and when people put more money in the channels, things will get better. But there still needs to be incoming balance for you to receive a payment, and that *will* create a hurdle for someone. I expect services to pop up, where you can, for a fee (that basically needs to cover an on-chain fee) can order an incoming channel. And I expect that once people part paying regularly, things will improve. But people that receive more than they pay, *will* have to find a plan how to push balance out again.
We're still early. These are issues that can be made much more userfriendly over time :)

LND and c-lightning still seems to have some issues agreeing on some metrics. I have had channels with newer (=at least approximately 0.4.1) LND connected to c-lightning, that c-lightning has force-closed on me. Other people report channels with Blockstream (and c-lightning) working ok.
@_date: 2018-04-12 08:23:46
I will try to explain it technically and honestly.
First: There isn't *much* liquidity put into Lightning Network yet. Blockstream store is pretty expensive for the small liquidity most people put in channels *at this time*. I have a couple of channels that can accomodate a couple of t-shirts from that store, but I have no idea how this guy was connected to the Lightning Network. I also assume that with the traction of Eclair users we saw after they released their beta a few days ago - which have a one-click way of just connecting to Eclair node to open a channel - had the potential to use up the liquidity of the channels at Eclair.
Second: There is still some disagreements on key parameters between various implementations. c-lightning, which Blockstream  uses, are also still not really in beta stage but in alpha stage - though I have heard it improves.
Just the other day, I (and a lot of others) had quite a few channels with c-lightning force-closed because our node proposed a reserved fee for force-closing of 250 sat, which was less than the 253 which is the minimum c-lightning accepts. This fee is adjusted dynamically based on the conditions of the blockchain. 
These are the small quirks that needs to be ironed out to improve the user experience.
So, this might have been any of these issues, and *is* really to be expected in these times. LN is fun, can be used, but currently quirks like this is to be expected.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:39:14
It is true, but it will be a magnitude better than all the small UTXOs that the same transactions on-chain would cause. Having many small UTXOs will raise your typical fee.  
In LN, each channel is now 1 UTXO, and that does not change during the lifetime of the channel.  
So yes - don't create too small channels so that you risk the reserved force-closing fee to "eat up" the spendable balance. But those $100-fees you might have heard about were both wallets grossly overestimating fees and transactions consisting of a very high amount of UTXOs.
@_date: 2018-12-22 14:09:57
Pretty much unavoidable.
But as most altcoins selling point is usually "faster, higher capacity on-chain", this isn't very grave. If on-chain is still dirt-cheap, LN will not be used too much.
This means that the path to centralization is laid from the start, and no LN will put that cat back in the box.
*I* believe in bitcoin over the altcoins because I think the only way forward is to make sure we preserve these decentralized properties - one of which is the ability for *everyone* to validate their own economy.
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:02:18
You can really decide for yourself if you want to use a channel for routing or not. If you want to only use it yourself, you can make it private. Then it's never announced to the network, so noone would know to use it for routing.
You can still receive money through it, though, as you can (and your node likely will) give out the info of these channels in an invoice, so that people who pay it can use them to find your node.
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:48:00
PLease understand that what you buy when you pay a fee is not speed, it's security.  
There's actually a site to calculate this: [  
The other chain that claims to be the true bitcoin is at the time of writing 1/23rd as secure as bitcoin, when coming to transactions.  
What does that mean?  
At the time of writing, a transaction of 200 bytes (segwit is smaller) is 140\*200=28000 satoshi, and that will get you the next block for 1.8 dollar.  
The fastest you can get the same security on BCH is 23 confirmations = almost 4 hours!  
BCH is far from fast, it's extremely slow!  
[bitcoinfees.earn.com]( says that right now, the same security on bitcoin will cost you maximum 75 satoshi per byte, or approximately $1. Sure, it's more expensive than BCH, but on BCH you \*can't\* buy fast and secure transactions.  
On BTC, you pay for security. That's worth something.

Andreas Brekken did a publicity stunt for an article he wrote, back in august.
Yes, he funded large channels with his own money, but he disregarded most advice he was given, and pushed on to get - probably - exactly the results he wanted for his article.
He spent only a couple of weeks on it, and if I recall correctly, he set some weird fee policys to try to increase his income.
Node software will route around that, and choose cheeper routes.

It is in production, but still early technology. There's still bugs happening, though more of the "increasing number of customer support calls" than "losing money" call type, by now. And there is missing functionality that is needed for it to be more reliable.
Spending more resources on customer support can be quite expensive for these companies, so they usually wait until technology is a bit more mature.
That said, I think I heard that electrum is working on incorporating it.

They could decide to honor 0-conf transactions. It's a security vs. connvenience tradeoff.
0-conf relies on a "gentlements agreement" that a miner doesn't accept a TX that spends the same inputs into its mempool - even if it pays more. There exists an official way of doing that, though, which is called RBF, but it's easy to not accept 0-conf transactions with RBF flag set.
In other words: If you trust people to behave, you might decide to skip waiting for confirmations, and consider it finished once you have seen the TX in your mempool. It's a bit risky, but some vendors might be comfortable doing this tradeoff.

At 500, I would by 5 of them. That's a promise.
I would do it because it is worth the "bet" for me, I have that much money I can risk not getting back for *years* - or maybe ever.
As we go lower, the psychological barrier - the point where all people are dead sure that it'll go higher again - approaches.
I don't think it can realistically go to $500. There's simply much more money that believes the price should be higher.
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:39:49
Not really. You'd have to ask individual node operators to publish some statistics.
If you run a larger node yourself, you might get an idea, based on the amount of transactions you are forwarding. But you won't know if everyone routes around you!
I run a small node. I forward some transactions. Not many, only a few. I know that I am mostly a detour, but since I get some transactions forwarded, I know I am providing reserve capacity when the straight-ahead-route fails.
(And btw: I do this not for economic gain, because that's highly premature. Most people with skin in the game now do it to learn, and because they believe LN is a much needed service worth being part of bringing to life. But I know some vendors have a sizeable number of LN transactions daily.

I have divided my bitcoin in 3 accounts on my hardware wallet:  
1) A HODL account. To the moon. My moon, that is, which might be different than yours. I will spend from it, but not for a long time.  
2) A short-term savings account. I'll spend from it when half of it is enough to cover cost of itself plus the stash from 1.  
3) A spending account. My LN node funds is also taken from here.  
So, in short: HODL. Spend. It's money.  Your money. That's the point of bitcoin.

Several? Why?
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:25:06
 is a list of stores. Feel free to open channels to the ones you  want. I prefer fewer large channels nowadays, and rarely open channels of less than a few millions satoshi. To help with routing, you of course need to have incoming channels, but if you have good outgoing channels you get attractive to connect to.
That said: there's not all that many transactions yet. I presume some large nodes forward a couple, but as a small node you will often be a detour. I think it's fine, I think of myself as reserve capacity.
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:54:14
There is always things to be solved in the future. \*Always\*.  
The only time you stop improving something is if it's dead.  
In case of LN:  
\- Routing will need to get better. Eventually. It's fine for now, but it needs to get better with larger adoption. This is known, and experiences from nowadays will probably be used to gradually improve it.  
\- We need watchtowers. Not because people are getting frauded today, but because they're an important part of game theory, which anything bitcoin is full of.  
\- UX in various wallets of course needs to improve.  
\- We need AMP (the possibility to divide a transaction into smaller sub-transaction that can be sent different ways, to get around liquidity limitations).  
\- Nodes might need to get better at learn from past "experiences", avoiding routing through nodes they know have bad performance.  
\- We could benefit from the ability to splice in/out - that is, add funds to an already open channel or use parts of funds on a channel on-chain.
  
Plus a whole lot of other things. LN is progressing nicely, but there's still tons of things left to do.
@_date: 2018-12-22 13:21:28
Basically, it's a secure form of 0-conf.
It's so secure you don't have to submit it to the blockchain, you can leave it in case you want to update it. This is the payment channel part.
It is so secure that on the promise of this, the node you are paying is willing to forward it out of his own pocket because he knows the security of your payment is good. This is the routing part.
This, of course a bit simplified.

The goal should always be to make it easy and convenient for people to accept bitcoin themselves, in a non-custodial way-
Offering payment processor services isn't inherently evil, of course. Software like btcpay makes it much easier to run non-custodial, but I think there'll always be a market for payment processors. We should applaud those that behave in a decent way. Which includes not taking bribes.

No node is in itself beneficial to the network. What's important that enough people validate transactions and blocks on different nodes.
They do not provide any network security, but I would say they give a coin financial security, in that a rogue miner or group of miners need to produce blocks that people accepting transactions see as valid. If 60% of miners decide to change properties but no people accept them as valid, they would mine worthless coins, while the 40% that 
kept the old rules could sell and spend the coins they mined. A full node is a tool you can use to either accept or not accept the work miners do. Without a full node you trust that others do the work.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:40:31
What security? With 128 MB blocks, if they were filled, we can be pretty much sure it will be run more like a project, and not like a decentralized cryptocurrency. It's the only way to scale that high.
A project can easily be derailed. Hint: Why did bitcoin succeed so far, where the previous attempts at electronic cash failed.
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:40:45
This will adjust nicely. If there's no other transactions, people will use low-fee times to open new or close old channels.
I  also think you need to think of this as a pyramid, where high-value is on top and low-value is on bottom. The bottom of it will mainly be performed with lightning because it's not economic to perform it on the blockchain, but the high-value will still be on-chain and will be willing to pay more fees. The limit between high and low value will most likely vary with on-chain usage, demand and other things.
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:59:46
Well, could be. It's difficult to say.  
When we talk about value of something, we can talk about several components:  
\- Intrinsic (utility) value
\- Speculation value.  
Speculation value is again based on a couple of things:  
\- The belief that someone will buy it for you at a higher price in the future
\- The belief that the utility value increases in the future.
I'd say LN channels fall into the utility value category, but maybe not purely. People can create LN channels on the belief that there will be more need of it in the future.
But. it is correct that if people start to believe more in putting BTC in LN channels than selling them in the market, this will decrease the sell supply, so if the demand remains high, it is likely this will lead to a price increase. Whether it is significant at this stage, however, is another discussion.

Then I'd be 100% certain it would be a glitch.
I'd first check if quantum computing had suddenly matherialized. If it's still not here, I'd buy 1000 of them. There is only around 1700 that needs to do the same for *all* bitcoins to be sold. So I wouldn't *get* 1000 at that price, that'd be pretty impossible. There's almost 100% certainly more than 1700 people that want to own more than 1000 BTC, and is willing to risk $1000 on the bet that it'd rise again.
The same, to an extent, would happen at $500. I wouldn't buy 1000 at this level, but it'd be more than 1. And there'd be *many* more people than me.
This, barring that there was something fundamentally wrong that lead to this price drop.
I think the only thing that *can* press the price as low as below $500 (bar is probably higher) is a fundamental flaw.

Watch towers make this prediction or guess harder
