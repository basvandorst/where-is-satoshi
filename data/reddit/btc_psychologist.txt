That's an unfortunate analogy, because if you were a little inflatable boat next to the Titanic, then you would most likely get sucked in towards it and under into the propellers.
This is why even though lifeboats launched well before the Titanic sunk, they were instructed to move away as quickly and as far as possible. Even though this is what they did, quite a few lifeboats were still sucked in and torn asunder.
Sticking with the analogy, you could say that Bitcoin isn't moving away, but is sticking close to fiat by having convertibility to fiat, and thus having centralized exchanges, centralized payment processors, speculation, regulation, etc.

"A remarkable story was told by Mrs. Violet Jessop , one of the stewardesses on board. She had infact been onboard the Olympic when she collided with the HMS Hawke and had also been onboard the Titanic. She seemed a very fortunate lady who had the same amount of lives as a cat. As she had seen the effect of the giant propellers twice before, **she jumped from the lifeboat before it was sucked into the propellers**. The suction was still to great and she was pulled in. However, for some reason she was not chopped to pieces but was thrown clear of danger and when she rose to the surface she hit her head on the lifeboat but was dragged to safety by survivors in another boat."

Taking it from one point of perspective instead of two, bitcoin rose ~1000% and then dropped ~700%
However, the volumes tell a different story.
Volumes show that not many people bought at the low levels - the vast majority of people bought at $1000 plus, so the idea that most people profited out of the Bitcoin bubble is a myth.

Fair point, I thought it to be the Titanic, but there are other references via a Google search which say lifeboats were sucked in. Perhaps it was the sinking ship itself that caused to draw in lifeboats close to it?
In one article from 1931, a survivor said:
"We had just moved a few yards from the giant ship when she was broken by the explosion of her boilers and sank in two sections. The suction did pull us back toward the great hole in the water the ship left as she plunged."
