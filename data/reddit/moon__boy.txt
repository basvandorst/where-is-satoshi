Too many pussies on here crying about a little price dip. WELCOME TO CRYPTO.

:::Buys BTC at $19K:::
"Yeahhhhh to the Moon!!!!"
:::BTC corrects to $10K:::
"BTC is dead! I'm selling!"
:::BTC runs to $30K:::
"Time to buy back in!"
So many little bitches on here.

BTC was at its ATH less than a month ago. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:28:02
$1.8k break even point - been living in profit land this whole time :)
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:18:23
Given the current price movement, I vote to rename BTC to TerriSchiavoCoin \(TSC\). Who else is with me?

No more whiney bitch posts from you now that BTC has been on the road to recovery?
@_date: 2018-06-17 05:45:21
A-C-C-U-M-U-L-A-T-I-O-N. It's happening in the shadows. Perfect time to scoop up cheap-as-fuck alts as well.

Satoshi has unveiled himself! What a load of **shit**
@_date: 2018-06-19 23:15:09
Lol, no wonder there's so much negativity towards BTC on this sub.
@_date: 2019-08-08 22:19:18
Looking at the current global economic instability and strength of BTC in 2019, everything is falling into place. Right in time for the halving. Awesome!
@_date: 2019-02-23 21:28:32
Slowly accumulated more through the $3k's - but I'm not convinced we've seen the final bottom. Have those low buy orders in, just in case! I wouldn't be surprised if those asshole whales have one more trick/final dump up their sleeve. Be cautious here in the short term people. 
Long term is looking great!

With Bakkt, Fidelity, and TD Ameritrade's crypto platforms up and running (hopefully) in 240 days, an ETF approval becomes much more realistic.

I'm long on BTC, but I think we may still be in for one last round of bloodshed before we're completely outta the bear market. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:40:25
No shit, Sherlock.
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:41:10
I accumulated a fair bit around 3300, but more cheap BTC would be nice!
@_date: 2019-04-30 17:11:33
Aaaaand Tether's lawyer admits it is only 74% backed by cash and equivalents. Big surprise!
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:21:28
With all of the shitcoins out there right now, I’m surprised Brian Peppers Coin doesn’t exist 
@_date: 2018-11-06 14:22:26
I can feel it, down in my plums. They're gettin' a nice blue-ish hue, ready to take them to the farmers market. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:22:35
Shut the fuck up
@_date: 2018-11-18 22:27:12
You might want to look into seeing a therapist. They can probably help with the emotional sting of buying at the ATH. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 03:28:50
What's ahead.
You'll probably break even, and even go a bit in the green on that 0.01 BTC "stack" you've got sitting on Coinbase.
Other than that, you sound like a bitter FOMO pussy that bought at the ATH.

Last time I had a buy order filled was July 2017, until today. Sitting here with my popcorn, this is awesome. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:28:55
Still more pain to come! Still too many optimistic people in here - once 99% of you poor redditors have lost all hope, that's when we hit bottom. Buckle up pussies.
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:21:53
Craig's shitcoin should be re-named BCH SVU. Bitcoin Cash Special victims unit.
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:53:04
Good move, welcome to BTC. You're entering at a good time, with the right attitude.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:41:32
It's not awkward if you started buying when I did.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:45:19
I'm just waiting for Michelle Obama to come out and endorse BTC. We'll all be saved! 
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:45:17
I've been waiting a long time for this. Time to load up.
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:59:15
Wrong. Let me guess. You’re a pussy?
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:44:23
This sub further confirms that we're in the "Anger" phase of the market cycle. "Depression" coming soon to a theater near you!
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:50:16
You sound like a huge pussy. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:13:08
I've been hodling and DCA'ing for around a year now (not long in this space, I know) and am still extremely happy with my positions. All of you Chads that bought in at $19k need to stop crying and realize that this is Bitcoin; welcome to thunderdome bitches. If you can't handle the erratic swings, go buy some Michael Kors stock and shut the fuck up.

Some big ass buy walls down around 8500. Gonna take a lot to chew those up.
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:56:16
Prolly bought at $19k and sold at $6k. Good job Chad
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:26:12
Yep, pretty funny watching everyone freak out. I️ got in early so I’m used to this crap. I’ll see you at $50k!

I'm laughing my ass off at all of the "TA guys" on Trading View. Gotta love Bitcoin and its unpredictability.

If I was a whale I would manipulate the price just to do the opposite of what MagicPoopCannon predicts on Trading View.

OMG isn't even close to its "Moon" yet. People that know anything about the project are waiting very patiently...
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:34:55
BTC defying all expectations - gotta love it.
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:21:05
Loving the fear. Stack those buy orders boys!
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:20:39
As others have said, DO NOT leave any significant amount of BTC or USD/USDC on Coinbase - or any other exchange for that matter.
