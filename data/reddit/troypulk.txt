I got nothing, maybe it's OCD.

I put .9985 for BTC amount and $200 for the Dollars and the fee is 30c and the total is $200.
When I put 0.02111790 BTC and $200 the fee is 50c and the total is $4.23
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:19:35
My math is right, if I buy $50 using Cash app they charge .72c 
If I buy $50 at Coinbase they charge $1.99
If I compare buying $50 at Coinbase to Cash app, there is a difference of $15 in Cash app's favor.
@_date: 2019-07-14 04:32:06
Thanks, That's why I'm checking.
What I did was use the Coinbase cost per coin as the real price compared to the cash app price which is inflated that's why it cost $15

From what I understand is that all your info and coins are stored on the block chain and are encrypted and your hardware wallet keeps a record of your coins and 24 word key which is also encrypted.
In this case you have control over your coins and the 24 word key not some exchange or wallet so if the nano gets destroyed you get another one and enter your 24 word key to get your coins.
Also the nano x is for wireless if you want to do that.

Do you still use it? if so what other problems are there? if not did you have to switch to something else?
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:30:18
The fee's
Transfer fiat from bank to pro for free and then buy btc for .15 and .25%
Coinbase will charge $2 and up to by btc.

Buy $3000 of Bitcoin with the money you get from your dad's death. Then hold it until 2017 and sell half.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:34:51
Do you if you can send to it directly from Coinbase, With or without live?
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:32:05
When I did that the internal backup appeared to not be enabled.
@_date: 2019-07-14 05:33:21
Not sure about selling, mainly I was comparing it with Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:52:39
That's cool,
I day dream about knowing about BTC when it was 50¢ and what I would do with it, knowing me I would of lost it on Mt. Gox.

Just curious, if the real Natoshi were to reveal him self what would he need to do to get people to believe him?
@_date: 2019-10-03 04:33:42
I like Gemini because as soon as you put in your fait you can us it to buy crypto, you still have to wait for it to clear the bank.
@_date: 2019-10-05 17:43:08
Coinbase pro and Gemini both work.
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:37:35

There are around 20 words in the picture what are the rules?
@_date: 2019-06-02 23:41:28
For argument sake, if it was banned world wide with no way to spend wouldn't it be worthless?
@_date: 2019-06-05 00:48:20
You can try an email or the Google authenticator app.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:48:43
You're fine just keep doing what you're doing, people are very paranoid around here.
@_date: 2019-06-30 06:10:31
Did you read the post?
He is transferring $1 worth of satoshi's which is about 8400 in to our lightning app so we can practice using it.

They will keep the price at the time you buy.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:23:07
In the blue wallet did you set up the transaction first and create an invoice?
@_date: 2019-06-30 05:34:57
@_date: 2019-06-30 06:02:23
Thanks, can I buy sats with the lighting app? If not how?

It's a basic 12 word pass phrase to get into the account and get the bitcoin.
The hard part is the cipher which contains the 12 words.

How do you transfer from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro?
@_date: 2019-06-09 00:25:32
Buy low and sell high.
Right now altcoins are probably better, watch the Price's and buy when they are low.
Bitcoin will go lower then buy, I'm waiting for 3 to 4k before I buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-06 00:49:47
I'm hoping for $3k so 6k

Fear Of Missing Out. The overwhelming sensation that you need to get on the train when the price of something starts to skyrocket.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:46:40
I talked to CB about why my funds in CB are not seen in pro and they told me something about login issue's.
But I think they are supposed to be connected I could never figure it out, but you're supposed to buy in CB and pro is for trading and they see all your coins together, but mine doesn't work.

Too bad the US people are too lazy to do anything about it, all they do is complain and wait for some else to take the first step.
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:34:57
It works in a browser but not on reddit.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:04:41

After you buy BTC there is a hold period of a few days.
If you bought with fiat there is a hold on that until it clears the system about 4 to 5 days.
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:00:31
Where did you get it, link?
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:07:26
I hope you're right!
@_date: 2019-05-31 00:37:15
If its convenient for you sure, a lot of people use it.

What does short mean?
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:35:10
Sorry, I just realized that.

This one,
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:31:55
I emailed Coinbase and they do not sell physical crypto. 
To buy it somewhere else I'm not sure.
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:43:29
Do you have to make a new invoice for each transaction?
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:50:10
Thanks, now what?
@_date: 2019-05-26 01:54:07
I'm asking because I used the same invoice number that I received the 100 sat in the beginning thinking it was a deposit number, after this is said my balance was zero but my wallet did not receive the other 100.
Thanks I'm learning.
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:04:32
I'm new what is this and what do these terms mean?
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:39:02
I'm new, what is Bitcoin about?
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:39:43
Does this look right:
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:05:03
Doe's this mean I'll get another 100?
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:09:09
How doe's it work? My wallet didn't get it.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:05:08
