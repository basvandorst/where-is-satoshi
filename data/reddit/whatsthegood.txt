"Bitcoin will act as the internet of money" - Andy Yee, Google Head of Public Policy. 
Bitcoin reduces the complicated tangle of global financial middlemen into elegant open-source software. Now, personal finance and financial instruments are finally available to anyone. Rich, poor, doesn't matter. As long as they have an internet connection, anyone can use Bitcoin. It's apolitical and cannot see borders, or race. Thousand year old shackles of finance have finally been lifted, as Bitcoin decimates the bottlenecks of centralized finance. It is as if cash could fly. Really, not much imagination is required to see what future potential lurks below.

Most gold trading is on paper and centralized, and real gold can only exist in one place at one time.

Lol? You'll get sued by the banking authority no matter what domain you use.

If you show up in casual clothes to book a boardroom for a $25k deal, you're lucky if they don't throw you out and flag your account as suspicious. Wearing a suit for business is absolutely crucial, or you won't get taken seriously. This is just a fact.

Hahahaha, police station. They'll take your money and you'll never see it again.
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:32:30
Wear a suit and talk business.
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:27:59
Move them now or I will

Sorry, but you clearly don't know what you're talking about.
