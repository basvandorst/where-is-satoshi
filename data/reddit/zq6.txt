I thought he invented the polio vaccine - wasn't Fleming the penicillin guy?

I think the fear can be averted if/when they realise that Bitcoin can be separate to their bank account (right? my wallet didn't require bank details at least!). There is no risk to your current account, only the money sitting in your Bitcoin wallet could be perceived as "at risk" and even then the risk is minuscule.

Full savings amount is considerably more, but I am hoping to get into property next year upon graduation so this £10k/$16k is my "safety cushion". My ISA (UK savings account which is not taxed and has an annual deposit limit) is maxed out every year. Currently unemployed (student) but will be looking to start a pension fund as soon as I am employed :)

You would consider them both to be speculative? BTC I can understand, but I thought investing in gold had been around for donkey's years!

By "short-ish" I mean a few months - the only way my bank can offer me a better rate is in fixed term bonds of 1 year or more.
I think you're right; gold pretty much keeps its value (maybe making a little bit of profit)  relative to inflation - money in a savings account likewise. BTC is riskier, especially since it's still sort of in its infancy I guess but I think it looks promising.
Worth testing the waters with a sum I can lose reasonably comfortably I guess. Thanks :)

The amount that I would be willing to invest in gold/BTC would be around the £10k (~$16k) mark, probably less (I am a very risk-averse person!). For now, I wouldn't want to invest more than £100  ($160) in either without looking into it all in a lot more detail.
At the moment I am a student so I don't pay tax on interest from the bank (my income is below the threshold here in the UK) - not sure how that changes with gold/BTC.

I guess the problem lies as much in the lack of technological understanding as in the fear of losing money in that case!

You're right - and I should have mentioned this in my original post. With a small investment (say $100 BTC equivalent) I would be hoping to see the profit it makes (if any) and spend the gains, probably keeping the original investment in my BTC wallet.

It's designed as a currency but is being treated as a commodity.

I'm in the UK (not entirely sure what inflation is but I think 1.75% is just about keeping my head above water). Thanks for the advice; I'll keep looking into gold and throw a few pounds into BTC.
