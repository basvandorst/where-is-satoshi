Can someone explain to mean what this means. Are you implying that the price is gonna shoot up tomorrow because the contracts will be expiring?

His point about how people putting in more than they could lose actually hurts Bitcoin in the long term in EXCELLENT, and should definitely be repeated in this subreddit. Advising people to be cautious with their investing has nothing to do with trying to help them financially. It's about preserving the stability and long term growth of Bitcoin.
If everyone were to put their life savings into Bitcoin, then as the price falls dramatically - as it periodically does - they would be much less likely to HODL because they would want to salvage what they have left. That scenario makes it much more likely to Bitcoin would fail completely when the price falls too much, because all the people who believe in it would get decimated beyond repair.
FOR THE GOOD OF BITCOIN, DON'T INVEST WHAT YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO LOSE.

This is great but if this dip is the same as previous dips in terms of magnitude then we have a looooong way to go. It will all be fine in the long run, but we won't hit the bottom until we're sub $4000 with this model.

You need to think very very hard about this decision. It could work out gloriously for you, but there is NO GUARANTEE that Bitcoin will be rising from where it is now anytime soon. There is a distinct possibility that you will be on the line for thousands of dollars.

From what I understand, the community should HODL as much as possible and even buy more, in order to squeeze the shorts that are made. 
I just see the upcoming futures launches as ENORMOUS tests for Bitcoin. This is where Wall Street, the people who this subreddit loves to make fun of as being "afraid" of Bitcoin, will have their first real opportunity to use their money to permanently clip Bitcoin's rise. Shouldn't we be taking this really seriously?
As long as we ride out the few days after each launch and the price stays steady, then we/Bitcoin will have passed the test.

Don't invest anything you're not prepared to lose lol

Well he certainly talks at the speed of lightning.

Theoretically though, what would happen if I have Bitcoin in my private hard wallet, and then engaged in a transaction with someone where I buy say, a car or a house and spend a bunch of the Bitcoin. Fiat money never shows up in my bank account, even though I was able to buy the house/car with Bitcoin that had increased in value like a capital gain. How would the government be able to tax it or even be aware that I had it?

Ugh. These need to stop. Enough with the condescending "I'm gonna be richer than you" memes. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:37:43
There is just no way this is true. This isn't a scientific poll. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:09:48
Okay. Thank you for this answer. It makes sense! HODL like crazy!
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:10:23
OK that makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:08:57
It's kind of funny - one way of knowing that the Bitcoin price is stable is going on this subreddit and seeing meaningful discussion and educational links/articles as all the top posts. When the prices is rising, all you see is memes.

It's comments like these that make me want to have all of my BTC waiting on Quadriga so that I can sell them within seconds at a moment's notice. It makes me think that even the ~1 hour it takes to verify the transactions from my other wallets onto Quadriga during the crisis would be too long, and the opportunity would be lost 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:18:10
Thing is though - a shit ton of that 21 million have already been lost because of computer and human error. Lost/destroyed hard drives, lost/forgotten keys - it's actually never going to be 21 million because millions of Bitcoins have already been lost forever.

Basically Coinbase isn't actually giving you real coins when you buy them. They give you an IOU for coins. Until you take those coins and put them into a wallet outside of Coinbase, you don't really own them. If something catastrophic happened to CB, like it was hacked or something crazy happened with the price and they ran out of funds for their IOUs, then you would lose everything you have with them.

These sorts of surveys need to stop. They're not scientific AT ALL, and only give people the wrong impression of how widespread Bitcoin adoption is. For christ sakes. A bitcoin trading website asked their own users how much they invest in Bitcoin and miraculously come to the conclusion that "millennials are storing their wealth in Bitcoin"?
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:43:33
It's my understanding that those coins are still accessible - they've just changed hands. Someone out there has the ability to move them if they want to. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:15:07
What does this mean exactly?
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:38:20
Ah. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:06:23
Ho boy.

I bought my ledger nano S off of Amazon. It hasn't arrived yet, but the seller was called DEFAULT GATEWAY and is being shipped from Japan. Should I be worried?

I mean this is a wonderful prospect to think about and I admit I've thought in these terms from time to time when I think about my BTC, but this is still an unhealthy attitude. 
You shouldn't talk about your future and your choices in such a wildly optimistic and condescending way. It's not what Bitcoin *should* be about. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:46:00
I mean I know it sounds a little sketch but I'm 100% sure you're being serious. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:21:29
Wouldn't that require months of a stable price after a sustained 50% drop in the price?
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:45:04
This is the sort of thing that should be more a part of the narrative of Bitcoin. About how it's made lives better.
