you can get a bitcoin wallet @  , use 2-factor authentication.
there are many exchanges that sell/buy bitcoins, bitstamp, mtgox and localbitcoins are the most popular.
For mining, you will need cgminer and AMD SDK 2.5
@_date: 2013-08-26 01:21:21
I know you can with mtgox, you dont need to provide any details to transfer btc.
But if you are using USD/EUR etc you will have to provide details.
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:35:13
You need to create a wallet: Www.blockchain.info
To send you simply type in receiving address and amount.
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:58:08
im not registered at localbitcoins, but you could buy from me.
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:38:01
you can buy it from me, i have some spare change lying around @ mtgox.
Although i have no idea how you wish to transfer your money, even i dont know all the "good" payment methods that could be used in this case.
@_date: 2013-09-18 15:47:53
It's still quite alot of money to invest into mining, i dont have a spare 3.5k lying around, but if you do, go for it.

First of all it wasnt about balance, it was about some "secret stuff"
I just woke up clothed on in my living room (like i usually do)
I woke up right before i was going to install p2pool on the governments computer lol.
Now some random dude is saying that he will post "expose" me or something, The U.S president is here too in Sweden right now, could it be linked lol.

I did the same mistake (cheap mistake though) of buying two 2A USB hubs from china, they were like 20 dollars though, buy anyways, there are some cheap 5A hubs that can support 10 erupters, 2A can only support 4 erupters.
@_date: 2013-08-21 03:36:04
It's bad

@_date: 2013-08-26 11:39:14
They are good for mining, however what is most important is focusing on the resale value if you are buying them, if you become desperate in need of money you could sell them (depending on if there is demand).
The price of them hasnt changed for a week now, and blade erupters start to seem more and more attractive.
@_date: 2013-08-28 21:41:11
Congrats, i will still catch up with you with my 27 erupters, once they all arrive (got 7 now), then a batch of 3 and a batch of 17
@_date: 2013-09-07 17:13:25
At least you get your bitcoins, depends on what the person wants to do.
Im already a verified Mtgox user.
@_date: 2013-10-19 14:59:34
I think that SEPA withdrawals are faster than USD withdrawals, so one workaround for us is to have a friend in the EU that can re-transfer the money back to you.

Too much to keep track of if you are a daytrader imo, that's why i don't give a shit and just mine bitcoins for the lulz.
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:48:15
This has happened to me too, but luckily there was a password reset after 7 years, one day i logged in and it was down to 72 hours, no idea what happned.
Got my 4.2 BTC though :)
@_date: 2013-09-04 07:27:57

Asic Erupters, you can get them for 0.37BTC at some place.
336mh/s per piece, buying many saves you shipping.

What is a bridge?
I can't spend more money on miners, i've reached my limit.
Better to get everything early though so you can take advantage of the difficulty.
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:33:27
I could, only problem i see is with chargeback, i wont do it though, PM me.

Well not exactly this... I doubt it...

350 BTC will give you 41,300 USD @ Bitstamp + any fees.
That will buy you a 100 blade erupters at 10Ghps (overclockable to 13Ghps), you will need a ton of routers and cables though. (100 connections and 100 cables) + PSUs
The expected generation output, at 130000.0 Mhps, given difficulty of 65750060.1491, is 0.994338970759 BTC per day and 0.0414307904483 BTC per hour.
(117.2USD per day or 4.893/hour)
