Those assets do not belong to the users.  They belong to the stockholders/owners.  You're not an OWNER ofmtgox or a shareholder (the shares were, IIRC, privately held).   And now, with MtGox entering administration, those assets belong to the Japanese state.

You don't have a deposit.  You seem to be missing the statement here.
When you put your money on Mt. Gox, for all legal terms, that was _NOT_ a deposit.  You were not in a bank or other financial institution.  You did not have an financial agreement with this company to monitor your money and to maintain your accounts.  In the eyes of the law, you had bought credits that looked very much like Fiat that you could exchange for bitcoin.   
People need to understand that "deposit" is a legal concept here that applies to financial institutions that are regulated by financial laws.  The bank that Mt Gox walked your money to (under their name) holds deposits.  Mt. Gox does not.

Many overseas electronic exchanges and companies send out tax forms for clients in different countries.   International law widely holds that when you initiate trades from home, you're under financial jurisdiction of your home country.  When you execute trades that are posted by someone else (like a stock broker), you're on the territory of the stock broker.
My company's IRA is trade in France.  I get French and US tax forms.  (Even though the french form basically has a "US Exception" for it, so I just mark it 0 and drop it in the box.)

Yes, but private keys are files.  Private keys can be protected and authorized by intermediary programs that multiple people have access to so that it can be audited who ordered tx's.  If there's no auditing done of who ordered what transaction, I'd highly suggest NOT doing your business solely in BTC.  
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:58:15

First, this is definitely a possible way that he did things.  That said, the code changes are likely saved in source control, and this is probably something he did when the code didn't work (if this is how it happened).  Even if you knock it down to 2^128 possibles, you're still talking centuries if we used every computer that exists or existed throughout all of human history.    The math here is staggering.
I think it's probably a bit of a different problem.  You don't want to programmatically create keys, because you might have a faulty PRNG.  I don't think, if the keys are lost, that he had such a program.  I think he generated numerous keys in advance.  Probably used those keys on a USB key that he kept with him or put in a bank.
And then one day, it didn't work.  And so you go to the backup..  And it's gone.  Or it doesn't work too.  
All that aside, the receiver now controls the assets of Mt Gox.   This thing is in the hands of the japanese bankruptcy court now.

Next the case enters into the bankruptcy process in Japan.  They list out assets, and liabilities, and creditors.  The court then helps them prepare a repayment plan for as many creditors as possible to whatever degree they can be paid.  Often times this is pennies on the dollar for some creditors.  
Depending on how bitcoin is addressed in the court, it may either be treated as a High risk investment or a hard asset like gold or silver.
I'm suspecting you will not get your money back , fiat or otherwise.

Because TRUE fractional reserve banking requires bitcoiners to accept that someone else MUST have control of their money.  If I have a wallet full of BTC, and I want to deposit that in a "bitcoin bank operating with fractional reserve", it's not MY account anymore.  It may be on paper and legally mine.. but I have NO WAY to pull my funds out, or spend those funds.  All I can do is ask the bank to please send me my money or please send my money to person XYZ.    What if they say no?  What's my recourse?
The whole POINT of this is that we don't NEED banks.  We need places to transfer currency.  That's it.  We need currency exchanges.  We do NOT need banks.

No, I don't agree on that at all.
Look, the only thing up for sale, if anything was up for sale, were the verified users list.  I don't think any buyer would agree to take on the liabilities, so that would go to a bankruptcy court regardless.  You really think someone is going to come in, and immediately start nearly $500,000,000USD in the hole?   The fiat money's gone, obviously this was a fractional reserve exchange, probably like all the others out there.   So the only asset left is the list.  
A bankruptcy court will probably be your best bet at even being made partially whole, and you'll be last on the line as your debt is unregulated and unsecured.
@_date: 2014-04-24 12:28:45
Technically bitcoins in an unregulated exchange are not financial instruments in a financial institution either.  You guys wanted it this way :P
The reality is, you're in a ledger book somewhere, but the coins are under ownership of MtGox.  (Or at least they were).  They were in a cold or hot wallet.   The only chance you have is that a court realizes that ledger book to be legitimate, and then allows people in that ledger book to put claims on assets as any other creditor could.  You'll get paid probably mBTC's on the bitcoin, but you'll get paid.  Eventually.   That's the best case scenario.
The worst case scenario is that they don't count the BTC lost or listed in the ledger book at all as assets, convert what is left to cash, and use that to pay creditors, of which you're not listed because the ledger book wouldn't count.  
Give the court time.  It'll take time.

I doubt that for the reason that the comments below that part you linked to.  There's no evidence at all that Mt. Gox EVER sold Magic cards or anything.   Therefore, all the information about the Wired article is based off a faulty source, which means the wired article too is likely faulty.
I still can't comprehend why Mt. Gox.  Why choose THAT name in particular?  Why does someone HAVE to buy that name for a site?   They never traded magic cards, nobody from Magic:TG remembers it or using it or anyone using it.. there are MTG forums where people can't remember it.. the Internet archive has no evidence of it, nobody has even come up with so much as a registration email for the Magic The Gathering trading software...

Legal fact typically runs down to the old adage that possession is 9/10ths of the law.  Mt Gox posseses the wallet.  You do not.  So, you will have to prove that you owned a specific chunk of assets in the wallet.  The ledger book should do that, but you don't get banking protection or other financial institution protection on this case.  It all, and I mean _ALL_, comes down to how the court values those bitcoins and that ledger book.  If they dismiss the ledger book, the bitcoin are Mt Gox assets, as you transferred bitcoin over to Mt. Gox.  I repeat.  People who put their money in Gox wallets transferred that money TO Mt. Gox.  Mt. Gox now possesses that money.  Mt. Gox holds the assets.
If the accept the ledger book, then you can probably claim some percentage of the assets left post liquidiation.  You're not going to get your money back, but you'll get a settlement offer.

He just said words, though.   We have those things NOW.  They're still run by humans who are untrustworthy.   The more complexity you put into a system, the fewer people use it.  This is why people left coins on exchanges, because they felt it was safer than having them elsewhere.  
We need the ease of leaving coins on online wallets, WITH the control over those wallets if things go south.   I'd wager every exchange out there, though, doesn't REALLY maintain user wallets.  I'd wager most every one of them is a MT. Gox waiting for a bad break.

You're not signing any contract.  To sign a contract, you have to SIGN A CONTRACT.  Physically.  The fact is, if you don't control the bitcoin's private keys, YOU DO NOT OWN THE BITCOIN.  That's why everyone has always said to transfer money OFF the exchange as soon as possible.  
Just because Mt Gox says your account has "X bitcoin" does not mean YOU have "X bitcoin."  If it were a bank, you'd have a case, because banking regulations cover this type of financial exchange.  But it's NOT a bank, so you don't have that recourse.  Mt. Gox had all the bitcoin in their personally controlled wallet, so those assets are Mt. Gox's assets, and not yours.

Okay, Meridian is a middleman insurance group.  Of course they don't PERSONALLY have the money to cover this (or any of the thousands of other clients they have), but they do take premiums and investigate and find companies or investors that are willing to take on the risk.

Like what, though?  Look at how bitcoins have been lost:
1) Trusting third parties.     How do you solve that?  You either don't trust third parties, or you institute some sort of regulatory control that forces those third parties to be trustworthy.  (This doesn't necessarily mean governmental control... just some kind of authoritative and enforcable control.)
2) Irreversibility of transactions.   If someone steals a credit card number from me, there are insurance companies that compensate credit card companies, and thus, the credit card companies can "reverse" the transaction and give me my money back.   If I'm ripped off by bitcoin, that doesn't exist now and never will without trustworthy companies.  
These are real problems that Bitcoin was not only not designed to solve, but was intentionally designed to NOT be a part of.

So what you're saying is that only libertarians should use bitcoin?  I disagree.
The fact is, not everyone wants to be a libertarian, and as for Satoshi, you don't know his principles at all.  He's a psuedonym, remember?  You don't even know the real satoshi, none of us do, so let's not project our ideals onto him since he's not here to refute or accept them.

So then someone bounces it to a different wallet.
Or a few million different wallets.  Cause.. it's easy to make new wallets.  Then they divide it all up, bouncing it among the wallets.  Then they combine it , and run it through a mixer.
THe heuristics on figuring out what to disallow and what to allow alone would be beyond the capabilities of what I see most BTC companies offering.

A little less libertarianism and a little more technical talk is what won me over.  I suspect in the long run, if bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) is to be successful, it'd have to ditch the conspiracy theorist anti-FED anti-government appearance.  Just like Linux ditched the "only for nerds" appearance and Apple has ditched the "only for hipsters" appearance.

While we haven't gone back down below the $450, if you think the Gox thing is over, you're in for a rough piece of news.

The difference is, if you handed me a $5 bill, I'm not likely to go look it up.  I might use it to buy lunch.  McDonalds might pass that money on to the someone who paid with a $20.  That person might use it to buy a pack of smokes.  Another $20.  Then two more groups of people before it stops at a bank and gets turned in with a safe drop by a armored car company.
Maybe 10..15 people.. and one tagged it, the final bank , to see if it came up on any "trace and trap" lists.
Now, Bitcoin.  I buy a bitcoin.  I purchase some reddit gold with it.  Reddit bounces it to other people, converts it, whatever.  Someone else buys it on a coinbase exchange.  It bounces around.  I can follow it around. I can see where that money goes.  Every single address.

Because Gox is a money-changer.  They change one form of money into another form of money.  Then, you're supposed to take your money and put it in your pocket or close to yourself.  That's the whole POINT of bitcoin, that we don't fucking trust random strangers.  That's why the whole technology is super encrypted and highly defensive.     Because we don't trust others.  
The people who left their money on Mt gox got what they deserve.  It's a valuable lesson to learn.   We shouldn't bail out losers in this case, that's not the proper libertarian thing to do.
The proper libertarian thing to do is point out their mistakes, create a teachable lesson from this, show people the right way to manage their money, and , if we were wronged, to sue the party that wronged us.
It's about responsibility.  I'm sorry you've signed up for a form of money that is libertarian in nature, but you're going to have to accept that money you LOST is money _YOU LOST_.     Accept that responsibility and that nobody should bail you out, and move on.

If you are aware of a crime, but you cover up the crime to maintain the value of your business, you're committing fraud by deception.  THe value of Gox and storing your coin on Gox and possibly even Coin itself was buoyed by this fraud.   With how corporations are run, too, remember that Gox is declaring bankruptcy but NOT any of the principles of Gox.  So no doubt did some of them make money off this fraudulent action.

Except when banks operate as "fractional reserve", their records are open to the FED banks in their area, and they are able to make interbank loans to fill in any needed gaps. (Or call in other loans between banks) at very low interest rates.  So while the entire system does operate as a fractional reserve system, there _ARE_ oversights and stopgaps that come into play.  Now I know many people disagree here about the efficacy of those oversights and stopgaps, but they at least ARE PRESENT.
In this case, though, who was the oversight?  Where were the stop gaps?  We don't even have books we can trust.  A fractional reserve bank is not a ponzi scheme, because there is never an intent to defraud a customer about the amount of cash a bank has on hand.  It's always well known, well published information.   Gox is likely a ponzi schmee because they DID intend to defraud the customers about how much was on hand.
@_date: 2014-04-24 12:38:28
Because legally , possession is 9/10ths the law.  Mt Gox owns those accounts.  They're not a bank, so there aren't any per-account banking laws in play here.  So people will have to prove, "No, those aren't mt. gox's coins.  Those are mine."  If they do not, (or if the court does not accept that evidence), then the coins are treated as Mt. Gox property as Mt. Gox owns them.
Libertarian thought on this pretty much says this: (From Murray Rothbard)  "[we] conclude that even though the property was originally stolen, that if the victim or his heirs cannot be found, and if the current possessor was not the actual criminal who stole the property, then title to that property belongs properly, justly, and ethically to its current possessor." 
It's Mt. Gox's assets unless people show sufficient cause that they are not Mt. Gox's assets.

Why should he have shame?  His business is selling it as if they were the victim of bad guys.  His lawyer probably advised him to smile and be relaxed.

Notice too that he's not talking to ANYONE except for little VERY controlled press conferences.

It really frustrates me when people refer to this as a fractional reserve.  Theoretically fractional reserves can borrow or bulk up on the money in case of a run.

Even if the US Government doesn't see bitcoin as a threat (i'm not convinced they do, really.  Things like this make it too volatile in most consumer's eyes, call them sheeple or whatevs.) you're STILL not going to see the money because there is likely a long line of creditors chomping at Mt Gox, there's a massive investigation on the way, and there's also the chance due to irreversible transactions and private keys and mixers and the like that no government can actually SEIZE the coins.  
Even if they DO seize the coins, we're talking a large scale theft of over $500,000,000 when you count the coins and the fiat.  This case will NOT be a quick case.  It'll be slow and drug out, and the money involved may be allowed to be used in the defense cases.

True.  The whole point of Bitcoin is that we didn't NEED to worry about the trust status of a user, that the network SOLVES that for us.

Depends on where you are at.
In the US, and abroad, many courts have found that EULA's are not legally binding contracts.  This is due to them being unenforcable, illegal in that jurisdiction, or contracts of adhesion.  It all depends on how the Japanese court considers the account holders there.
It is telling that in the filings, they don't list the sum of the btc to fiat at time of filing bankruptcy, and only list physical assets.  That might mean they don't consider the BTC assets at all, and thus, you wouldn't be a creditor if the court agrees with that finding, because you'd have placed no legal assets there.
The business is under administration now.  And the court has legal status to accept or reject the asset disclosures.  It's all up to them how you are viewed.

The guy who founded Mt Gox and then left Bitcoin to found Ripple, who some people believe really is Satoshi?
He profited.  And seems to be at the center of a lot of this.

You value it using a consistant exchange price for both the acquisition and sale date of the bitcoin.  So if you bought the 5 bitcoin at Coinbase for $200 each, and then sold it (transferred property) when the value was $750 each, you will have to pay capital gains taxes on $750*5 - $200 *5 , or $2750.

Oh , true.  It's just that people point to that picture and say "See, Microsoft were geniuses."  But even Star Trek had "padds" before the tablet computer in 2002.  It wasn't anything new, it was 40 year old technology :D  
The difference is, for right or wrong, Steve Jobs KNEW when the right time was.   That's my point.  Getting something out first and getting it out right are different things.   
Funny thing is, the thing that got Bill Gates into the game at the start was him promising another company's product as though it were his own, and then buying that other company's product after the deal was made :D

Why would the government have to do that at all?  Mt. Gox looks like it was either internal mismanagement bordering on Ponzi scheme or outright theft by internal or external parties.    
They don't have to get involved.  Bitcoin's got enough actors in bad-faith that it'll do its own damage if we're not careful.

Forgive me for being skeptical, but people can lie on quarterly reports. Idon't want just a published quarterly report.  I want a published quarterly report that shows me how I can analyze the data personally and arrive at the same answers.
If I can't get that, then how do we know the others aren't just cooking their books too, like Mt. Gox?  I know plenty of companies involved in the US Financial meltdown published stellar quarterlies before the melt down too.

Too bad for them, then.  This is high risk trading.  I'd suggest they learn from this that you shouldn't place high risk bets with money you can't afford to lose.

I'd wager it's already been tried.  Remember, leading up to this week, MK had at least the top three competitors in house to try to sell the place.
I also think the fact that they all three immediately went to the authorities suggests that it's not just a lost key scenario but something illegal.

Bankruptcy courts do usually immediately issue an order of relief that stops/suspends all the other litigation that usually goes on when a company becomes insolvent.

If the three supposed buyers  , as 2BI hints, IMMEDIATELY went to the police/authorities because of issues they saw, that probably means that this was indeed a ponzi scheme.

Hint: If something is having you put real BTC in and telling you you'll get bitcoins held by GOX, you're going to lose your money.

There were supposedly even MORE people looking over the OpenSSL source, and the exploit has been in there for a large number of years, and they missed it.
Number of eyeballs looking at code does not necessarily make the code safer.  It's whose brains are behind those eyeballs that make the difference.

You know how you scam people out of more money after you've initially scammed them out of money?  Tell them for a few dollars more, you can get their money back.  
That's what you're suggesting people do here.  Stay with them to get their money back.

My definition of a bitcoin card is one that does the conversion from an address you specify "on the fly."  I'd prefer one with the only transaction fees being bitcoin's inherent transaction fee, not a per usage fee of 1 to 1.5 percent.   Also, .25 bitcoin is a little over $100, but when bitplastic started, bitcoins were up around $1100, so that would be $200-$400 depending on the fluctuation.  That's a lot.
In this card, you transfer money from your bitcoin address to the card company's, and he transfers (after taking fees) money onto your card. This can take a period of 3 to 4 days according to reports.  Then, you can only use $200 a day in total transactions.  It does appear that you cannot deposit money INTO bitcoin through this card, if you put cash in, it stays as cash on the card.
For me, it doesn't "actually work", it's a high priced reloadable debit card.

I do keep using that phrase.  There reaches a point where you spout so much of this that you discredit some of the things you are saying.  People tune you out.  You want to know how to deal with bitcoin skeptics, the answer is YOU DON'T MAKE THEM TUNE YOU OUT WITH THINGS COMPLETELY UNCONNECTED TO BITCOIN.
Okay, if you believe the Jewish banking conspiracy is ruling the world, FINE.  But does that change how bitcoin operates?  Does it change how a user would use bitcoin?  Does it change how secure (or insecure) bitcoin is for various use cases?  See, here's the thing.  The average person doesn't give a flying flip about half the conspiracy theory bullshit I see here.  They want to buy a cup of coffee at a coffeeshop or a 36 count box of toilet paper online or pay their rent.  They can do all this with fiat or bitcoin, but the people who show them how to spend money don't load their introductions to fiat down with all kinds of extraneous political crap.  They say (often at a young age) "Look, this is money.  We use it to exchange for services and goods."  
That's what I'm saying.  Leave the jewish lizard rothchild NWO NSA star child PRISM HAARPA DARPA Obamacare out of it.  Just tell them how it's money and how it works.  The rest, if it really is a good product, will take care of itself.

Well, he did just effectively lose 6% of the coins that will ever be made.

CounterCounter point.  Eve's economy is a Fiat economy.  They QE it with the introduction of rare / etc materials in asteroid belts/ bases / etc.  
Eve is NOT a free market, it's a heavily manipulated central bank controlled by tiny nudges at the leaf nodes of the economy.

Or that he's done. Dude, Bernie Madoff, Ken Lay, all those guys also looked and acted like he acted in court.  It means nothing.  And besides, he's not in a criminal court.  He's not going to be guilty in bankruptcy court.  
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:41:08
Um.  If the business has no money, the court is kind of bound to grant him protection.   It's why he incorporated in the state he incorporated in.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:30:35
Yeah, it does, because people lost their coins because they made bad decisions.  It sets a dangerous precedent to take those coins from other people and give them back to the people that made bad decisions.
I'm sorry people lost money.  But I'm not even a hard libertarian and I knew not to keep my money in someone else's house if that house had no regulation or insurance.  
Also, I'm not sure a 51% attack would do this.. this might need a full 100% fork.

I'm a fan of long con movies like "The Sting" and "Ocean's Eleven."  I've always thought it curious that mt gox claims it was a magic the gathering online exchange site, but nobody seems to ever have used it.. and then.. it suddenly turned into a near fully featured Bitcoin trading site.   And it did all this seemingly out of nowhere.  
And the founder just happens to be rumored to be the person who invented bitcoin.
A lot of coincidences in a very small area.  Could just be my imagination though.
@_date: 2016-02-14 18:11:57
Well no, I don't mean _JUST_ for the bitcoin thing.  I mean for everything.   I think everything he's supposedly done hasn't been investigated enough and would fall apart to due dilligence.  From the "drug price inflating" to the "drug company" to buying the "Single owner album" to this new Bitcoin thing.
I think it's all just an elaborate troll.

I'm somewhat convinced Martin Shkreli is an elaborate troll/prank.
Dig any level into him, and his stories and such just fall apart.

I'm alleging that the drug was extremely new to market, didn't have very many (if any) users, was already something that was covered, and the pharmaceutical company was a new company that seemingly came out of nowhere.
I don't doubt that he was called because of his little games with stocks and price manipulation.  I just think he intentionally created it all.
I also suspect he gets off when this goes to trial because it'll all be laid bare what he did.
@_date: 2016-02-14 18:41:41
Oh, I've looked deeper into this guy as time went on.  Granted, the thing he's alledged to have done is pretty nasty.  And it's sadly too common in the pharmaceutical industry.
I'm just not certain he did it.  And even the media now, granted, I know Scalia just died and that's dominating the news, but why isn't news about his "fifteen million" being carried on the major networks now?  Why isn't his commentary about Kanye being put there?  Why isn't the news that Skhreli knows who and has contact with Satoshi being put in the mainstream news? Why were his future congressional hearings cancelled/removed?
I contend the reason he's not getting maintime news play now is that they figured out this guy was and is a pathological liar, and much of what people believe he's done has been originated in his own press releases.  He created himself, and now he's getting less and less attention because it's not working anymore, and so his tantrums are getting more elaborate and unbelievable as he tries to get people in the media to pay attention to him again.

Oh, I know.  I know that the Wu-Tang Clan sold an album to an anonymous buyer through an auction house, and I know that the auction house claims an anonymous buyer bought it and I know that the guy who also has claimed he has Kurt Cobain's Visa Card and has also touched the shotgun that killed Cobain says he also bought the album.
I just think that he's a liar.

Yes.  The courts and norms and values of the world think it is wrong to intentionally steal other people's property, and to defraud those other people.
