The problem in Greece is not imminent hyperinflation, but capital controls preventing them from extracting their savings. I don't see why they'd need to buy bitcoin, just withdraw EURs or move the money offshore. Sadly I think it may be too little, too late. Those controls will most likely be implemented on Monday and the ATMS will dry up pretty quick. You can be sure that the wealthy elite in Greece saw this coming and moved their money out weeks/months ago.

Google Adwords is built on top of their own proprietary F1 SQL database and it's currently scaling well beyond 100 TB.

Sounds like a good idea. Sorry I'm not that knowledgeable about the system requirements to run a full node... Is this something that could be done using an Amazon EC2 instance? Maybe create a virtual machine image with all the pre-requisites so a new full node could be deployed quickly and easily. Are these full nodes CPU, memory intensive or is it more storage dependent...or all of the above?
Maybe an EC2 instance would not be cost effective, just thinking out loud.

Yes you're right, I'm sure Linux + ssh would be a more secure option! If setup correctly, I think you could reduce the margin of trust to the employees of the cloud hosting provider. The main point I want to get at here is that blockchain.info has become a target. Hosting an EC2 instance seems on the face of it to protect through anonymity...who'd think to check some random VM for a wallet when these machines are used for a wide range of purposes. If you have a 16+ character password on the wallet, even if the machine gets compromised it's still pretty solid.

 &gt; TL; DR: Gains on bitcoins are taxable income. They become taxable when you sell bitcoins for cash or exchange them for goods or services. The IRS does not receive any direct information regarding your bitcoin transactions, but it has other ways of finding out. The monetary and criminal penalties for failing to report gains are not worth the taxes you'd save.

I'm not against regulation, but it needs to be applied logically and the current system is devoid of all logic.

Yeh I went to Kenya a few years ago and Safari Comm is really great! I should have perhaps clarified that I was referring to online commerce in the developed world. I understand the huge potential that bitcoin has for the unbanked.
The point I was trying to make in my post was that the particular application as a means of payment (i.e. the one always discussed on r/Bitcoin) is just one of bitcoins many facets. This is probably one of the reasons people have a hard time understanding bitcoin as it can be many things at once.

Technically you don't but your existing wallet has a private key that has been on a hot device, i.e. anything connected to the web.

That's true, In a deflationary economy everything would just work in reverse. Imagine an economy where the price of goods &amp; services decline year-on-year along with wages. In real terms of course we would be no worse off.
In fact it would shift the balance of power away from politicians and slave driving capitalists. Under the inflationary model wages always lag behind rising consumer prices and this is used to extract more productive work for less. In a deflationary system wages would need to be adjusted down to meet falling prices.
Inflation also encourages people to take on more debt and discourages saving. The opposite is true in a deflationary system. Those who prescribe more of the same are just feeding into a massive ponzi scheme. Deflation is not a dirty word it just doesn't much suit the status quo.

Bitcoin is an emerging technology so right now the path of least resistance still involves some resistance! I would start by getting a wallet ([blockchain]( or a wallet app like [Mycelium]( are good options), if you're in the US you can use [coinbase]( to add some funds. But here's the catch, it's not quite frictionless, as you need to upload some ID docs first, why because the exchanges are still worried about getting into trouble with the regulators.
It's getting easier but there's still some effort required to get off the ground.

There's some flawed logic going on here. Why would any company wishing to destroy bitcoin then create their own branded crypto-currency only to invite miners back onboard to convert it into another decentralized coin and thus cede control? And conversely why would any centralized coin under a corporate banner bother with a "mining" process at all, it would be superfluous. 
This doesn't even touch on the huge investment in ASICs required to actually register any hash-rate. Of course Google does possess monumental compute power through their global data-centers but you can't just repurpose this to mine bitcoins. CPU mining died some time ago.

They want a way to tap into $7 billion of newly minted wealth. Classifying bitcoin as "property" and applying this retroactively means they can just use capital gains to get a slice of the pie. No way are they going to pass up on that! But I'm confident these problems can be solved in software.. Wallets are going to have to be pretty damn sophisticated the way things are going.

Yeh it's impossible without some escrow party, which then centralizes the whole thing. I've never bought any bitcoins on an exchange, I've always used services like localbitcoins or bitbargain and I have never once had a problem..I feel this is the closest you can get to decentralized. When I used these services everything was done by bank transfer and I only bought from sellers that had a good track record and OTC Web of Trust identity.

What's stopping people from hoarding and spending horizontally? they don't need to be mutually exclusive.
It's a case of voting with your wallet and rewarding those business that support the bitcoin economy. If a given business is able to tap into a new demographic by offering payment in bitcoin this will encourage others to do the same. The more businesses accepting bitcoin, the more this will raise the profile and dismantle the arguments propagated by mainstream media that bitcoin is a ponzi or used only for buying illicit goods.

Do you own any bitcoin to pay them with, or do you need to acquire this first? From an accounting point of view you would create a separate bank account in your accounts program to represent your BTC wallet and post the outgoing amount in there as a GBP entry. Use a spot rate at the time and document this in your accounts.
Whenever you buy bitcoin you would treat the debit on your main bank account as a transfer to the BTC account. Eventually you will end up with a NET loss/gain in the BTC account. Periodically you can journal this into the currency loss/gain nominal account. Which nominal to use very much depends on your accounts package.
BTW: I run a UK based cloud accounting company that works with Bitpay. We have some [bitcoin accounting instructions here](

The vast majority of the people in the UK I have come into contact with are completely apathetic about bitcoin and see it as nothing more than a speculative investment. The notion of using bitcoin as a currency is a non-starter and confers absolutely no advantage over debit and credit cards (at this moment in time).
There's certainly a lot of negative sentiment towards the banks here but the argument of using bitcoin as a way to kick back against the banks is a complex one and not one that most people are willing to inconvenience themselves to do.
Look at the [recent UK merchant survey here]( half of the merchants who have adopted bitcoin in the UK have not made one sale. Until we have a UK equivalent of Coinbase I can't see anything changing here, people are just not gonna take on risk and the inconvenience of buying on places like localbitcoins.com and faff around with the AMLR ID checks just to go and spend the bitcoin again.

I just thought others out there may want to see what Apple are up to in the mobile payment space and how this relates to their recent decision to drop-kick the Blockchain App out of their walled garden. The fact that they didn't issue a reason to Blockchain for banishing them is almost redundant...the real reason is right here. Apple have been hoarding patents in this space for some time and bitcoin is nothing more than an irritant, an untimely one at that! So behold Apple's grand plan for a centralized payment system backed by patents and lawyers...Well done Apple, you've picked a hell of a fight ;)

The remittance and international transfer business is the property of the banking elite. The UK prides itself on being a financial hub (or London to be more precise) but it's essentially just an old boys club. How many banking licenses have been issued in the UK in the last 30 years??...you can count them on one hand! No competition, no pressure to lower prices, no incentive to change! 
Bitcoin renders these gate-keepers redundant! Remittances are a lifeline for some of the poorest nations on earth, Bitcoin and cryptos in general will have a huge positive effect not just for rich Westerners but also for many existing under oppressive regimes or without access to basic financial services...Or as Andreas Antonopoulosputs puts it "The 6 billion unbanked".

For me I'm still on a learning curve with bitcoin so I really like to see how the news and developments in the bitcoin space affect the price.

I did later read the whole article and see that they clarified this further down by quoting Mike Hearn. Although the wording is slightly contradictory.

@_date: 2014-10-02 14:09:32
"all those fees", sounds a bit hyperbolic. Most people participate in the bitcoin economy because they are opposed to the current payment and banking systems and want to affect change, many can afford to do so. Of course not everyone cares, that's their choice!

Card transactions don't qualify the card holder's name, you can put Mickey Mouse in there and it will go through the automated checks. They do however verify the premise number, address, zip/postcode and card issuing country. This does have some value in terms of KYC but depending on your industry and regulatory responsibilities it can seldom be used on it's own.
The good thing about having address verification through card payments is it allows merchants who are shipping goods to eliminate a lot of fraud. I.e. only ship to the cardholder's address, not sure how bitcoin would solve that problem?

It's not entirely hands free, as in a merchant could just take money from your wallet without you touching your phone, I think the OP wrongly inserted that phrase, let's face it who'd actually want that? I still think using Bluetooth as PayPal Beacon does is much better than scanning QR codes. Merchant initiates a sale, details flash up on the customer's smartphone, it's down to the wallet app what additional authorisation needs to take place, could be just a case of clicking a confirm button or it could be a fingerprint scan, pass code entry etc.

They are an incorporated company at Companies House and they are accepting deposits from UK citizens so I'm not really sure where they stand with that one? I would have thought they'd need to be registered for AMLR in the UK.

Money Laundering Regulation is something that Bitcoin will need to adapt to in order to become mainstream. There's no refuge in altcoins, they will not solve any of these problems.

I agree with all your points here. But there's no denying that the current monetary system is broken. Steady inflation is indeed good, but instead we've had reckless casino banking, tax payer bail outs and rampant inflation.
For the first time in modern history we have an alternative, borderless medium of exchange that relies on distributed trust. We now have **choice**, something governments have being trying to stamp on for years.
I appreciate these concepts are difficult for the average lay person to grasp but the notion that we should seek their advice for the solutions to these complex problems is absurd.

It's also very difficult to have a decentralized exchange that allows bank deposits, who owns the bank account that will collect the deposits?

Granted, in this particular scenario there's little benefit to you using bitcoin over conventional methods. But bitcoin is so much more than a currency for buying items on Amazon, it's a store of value that can be moved around the world in minutes while incurring minuscule fees, nothing like this does or ever has existed. Bear in mind there are 5-6 billion people in the world who don't even have access to basic financial services, some of whom live in oppressive regimes with very restricted freedoms. These countres often rely on remittances from outside and currently banks and money remitters like Western Union cream off incredible profits from these activities, from those that can least afford it.
Also I don't agree that the costs of using a service like bitcoin will not trickle down to the consumer, market forces will ensure that the consumer is rewarded. Think about it company A offers a payment by bitcoin option and pockets the change, company B offers the same service and passes on the savings, which one will come out tops in the end?
Make no mistake that banks and credit card companies make huge profits providing credit and debit card services. This infrastructure is controlled by a handful of institutions that have an imperative to keep delivering profits to their shareholders. There's no such thing as free banking, banks and credit card companies are not designed to be a benevolent force for the people. In the case you describe the cost of delivering the payment is already built into the price you pay at the checkout.

There's still no easy way to buy bitcoin in the UK. We basically need to use a p2p marketplace (e.g. Localbitcoins or Bittylicious) and pay a premium, or send a chunk of money off to Bitstamp in Slovenia.

But you have to question what would motivate the average person to buy bitcoin on a p2p exchange only to spend it and forfeit their right to a chargeback and probably end up paying more than if they'd just used their debit or credit card.
I just think right now there's nothing to motivate the average consumer to use bitcoin. There's certainly a strong case for merchants, but not really for consumers and ultimately it will be consumers that drive change.
I also believe that there's a far stronger libertarian ethos in the US than there is in the UK. Taking control of monetary policy away from government and putting it in the hands of a distributed community seems to resonate more with our friends in the US than it does over here.
Bitcoin is a brilliant invention, but until it's backed by more sophisticated and secure infrastructure it's not going to become a mainstream method of payment.

What about [3D Secure]( In the UK (And I believe much of the EU) this acts like a secret password from which you must enter several letters at the point of sale. This is applicable for most online transactions now. Even if someone skims your card they can't go on a shopping spree online without this code.
I'm a UK merchant selling digital goods, since the implementation of 3D Secure I rarely ever get any chargebacks on 50k a month of card sales. From the few cases I've had the arbitration process doesn't automatically favour the card holder, if they've been negligent in protecting their password then the blame lies with them. It's the same if someone steals your card and extracts cash through an ATM using your pin, unless it was under duress and reported to the police the bank is unlikely to take your side.
EDIT: I believe 3D Secure is specific to Visa but there's also a Mastercard equivilent called something like securecode.

I don't see any of these altcoins posing a threat to Bitcoin. Not one provide any significant utility over Bitcoin and most are inherently weaker by virtue of the fact that the computational power backing the network is miniscule compared to Bitcoin.

Regarding "Recurring Payment Solutions".. surely this is possible with Bitcoin, but it would work on a push basis rather than pull, which in my opinion is a good thing! If I want to spread the costs out with a supplier I can setup a standing order with my bank, I can then cancel it whenever I like, i.e. if they fail to deliver. The same is theoretically possible from a bitcoin wallet and I don't need to entrust the security of my credit card with a 3rd party.
Regarding the KYC aspect, if someone pays me in bitcoin I know it can't be reversed. With a credit card I really do need the additional meta data to be sure that this is not some scammer using a stolen card or they're not going to hit me with a chargeback later.

I like the idea and it's great they're accepting payment in Bitcoin but I have some reservations. They're not likely to  see tremendous sales in bitcoin. For one bitcoin adoption and usage in the UK is very slow at the moment owing largely to the lack of channels available to acquire bitcoin for your average user. WeDeliverLocal.co.uk has fairly sparse coverage (even large swathes of London are not covered).. this shrinks the demographic of potential BTC users even further, but I acknowledge this model is still in it's infancy.
The other thing to think about is that centralised models actually work well in the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) market. They capitalise on economies of scale and purchasing power. This model therefore can't really compete with the established supermarket chains on price but can effectively compete on choice. Much of the UK supermarket sector is dominated by the big discounters (Asda, Lidls, Aldis) and the premium brand providers (e.g. Waitrose)..not much room in the middle. So in essence I'm not sure they can compete effectively at the high end of the market and certainly not at the lower end?

Now with bitcoin we're trying to usher the masses into a technology that demands a more detailed understanding of security and the application of various measures to mitigate against loss. Until bitcoin deposits are fully insured and people are protected from their own stupidity I can't see how as a currency bitcoin will work, on it's many other applications however it will be a huge success.

I have a HSBC account and have been through several lengthy QA sessions when attempting to make international bank transfers. Also 2 days ago they throttled the value of payments I could make in one day to £600. It's a business account, so was very surprised by this!
Following the money laundering scandal HSBC stepped up their due diligence procedures in the UK...like 10-fold!! But honestly I don't know if these recent restrictions are more to do with a liquidity crisis or fear of breaching Money Laundering Regs??
BTW the Money Laundering Regs in the UK are incredibly woolly. Regulated businesses have a very vague set of requirements to demonstrate ongoing monitoring. The rules are not prescriptive and companies are fearful of being penalised, not to jump to the defense of HSBC but I run a company that is regulated under MLR and I've had the inspectors around making threats!

I think you've raised an important point here. You only reach the Eureka moment with Bitcoin when you understand how liberating the technology is. To get to that point you need some grasp of macro economics, technology and the power of network effect. Unfortunately these concepts are **EXTREMELY** difficult to sum up and unify in a 5 second sound bite. I just don't think it's a leap you can make in 5 seconds.
I always wonder what motivates people to down vote on this sub? I think you raise an excellent point! I'm of the belief that if you can't explain the merits of a new technology succinctly to your audience you have problems. Fortunately bitcoin can work as a store of value and a currency. I think the "store of value" message is a far easier one to sell to the right audience rather than getting the masses to throw away their credit cards and start using bitcoin to pay for all the crap they buy on Amazon.
@_date: 2014-04-18 19:01:45
Definitely! If I were Amazon, I would take the same position. Give it a couple of years and I think it will be a very different story. Right now it's encouraging to see how much financial and intellectual capital is being invested into solving some of the problems around getting bitcoin into the mainstream. Amazon adoption should come much later.

That's interesting! There's no easier place (that I am aware of) in the world than the UK when it comes to setting up a company. Company formation agents in the UK are also subject to Money Laundering Regulations, except if you incorporate directly with Companies House online in which case being a government agency they have afforded themselves the privilege of bypassing the burden of regulation entirely. I've always been confused about Bitstamp's presence in the UK, it [does indeed appear that they are not registered for AMLR in the UK]( but they seem to endevour to adopt all the AMLR "best" practices.

I've used bitbargain.co.uk, bittylicious.com, both are pretty good but not really competitive compared to the options available in the US. I'm currently trialing Bitstamp, these guys have a UK based address but oddly the transfers need to be made to an account in Solovenia, so you need to factor in the 3 day window for international transfers. Also my bank charge me £15 for overseas transfers, so I think this route will only be competitive if you are sending £1,000 +.

From what I have observed here's a few things you should never do when using a hot wallet.
1. DO NOT backup your wallet to email or Dropbox (or any other internet connected location). If there's no 2FA on either of these services then it's pointless enabling it on your wallet. Backup to a paper wallet and keep it safe and secure. I think blockchain should be doing more to warn users about this.
2. Use a 16+ character password including varying case, with letters numbers and symbols. Don't use dictionary words.
3. On blockchain.info you can setup a secondary transfer-out password. Use this.
4. If you can, use the IP restriction feature, but DON'T do this unless your ip is static. You can also list a few comma separated IPs. I would suggest doing this just in case for some unforeseen reason you lose one of them.
5. Personally I wouldn't use the phones apps, it's just another attack vector. Create a separate wallet with a smaller balance and hookup the app to this for day to day purchases.
6. Use Google Authenticator or Yubikey over SMS and email based 2FA. Any 2FA that sends a key over an open network is introducing another potential weakness.
If any others want to add to this please do! Apart from the obvious "Don't use online wallets" :)

Having a clear regulatory framework will be the key to pushing bitcoin into the mainstream.  For as long as bitcoin floats around in this quasi legal grey area I just don't think any big tech companies will get involved, there's just too much reputational risk. As soon as we have clarity here I think we will see a huge influx of VC money and many more large platforms adopting bitcoin.
Regarding your points on a challenger supplanting bitcoin, I can't see how this would arise from a company like Google, anything they produce will be inherently centralized and thus incomparable to bitcoin.

Reports suggest that 2 of the 7 servers responsible for processing debit and credit card transactions failed. My question is where is the fail-over, this looks amateurish! These companies have millions to invest in their infrastructure and really should be doing better. Natwest and RBS had similar problems on two separate occasions in the last 18 months (one of which lasted for 2 days). This is a problem that is endemic in the UK banking system and there's complete apathy when it comes to looking after retail customers. They'd much rather churn money into highly sophisticated trading bots and algorithms to manipulate markets than upgrade their retail infrastructure.
I agree though Bitcoin is not immune from similar problems. The probability of the blockchain going down is extremely unlikely but there could always be a failure at the POS level. The difference with Bitcoin is we'll have a choice over which provider we can use. Unlike the choice of 4 banks we currently have in the UK.

I found this article very interesting, but I have to say even if Bitcoin only ever becomes a store of value it still has very good prospects. If in several years it becomes widely adopted as a sort of digital gold, I think it's utility as a currency will inevitably follow. But I think it will be in that order...store of value &gt;&gt; price stability and then a practical means of currency.
Recent events have shown us that first generation bitcoin infrastructure is the weakest link. I'm talking specifically about the exchanges here. I live in the UK, yet I have to send money to Slovenia (via Bitstamp) so I can buy btc at a competitive rate, or I'm left to barter on localbitcoins where I'll pay a premium. I'm a bitcoin enthusiast so I don't mind, but most people aren't and will instead just whip out their credit card to pay for what they need and frankly I don't blame them.

One thing that concerns me is the centralization of bitcoin through market forces and economy of scale. There will eventually need to be artificial restraints in place to stop 50% + centralization.

I think it's possible, and given enough time quite likely. My view is that competition is likely to emerge from state backed crypto-currencies if bitcoin can be proven beyond doubt to function as a replacement to fiat based currencies. The other possibility is if bitcoin fails to scale up to meet demand... But I think there'll be iterative fixes to handle this rather than an outright replacement.

I think you can only safely exclude words that are 14 characters or longer to accommodate for two remaining words that are a minimum of 2 characters each. There are less than 100k words over 13 characters, so I don't see it making a big impact on the end result.
However the math goes over my head when you factor in the combination length. I.e. there's no point in testing for 3 words that are 12 characters long. So I agree my original estimate is still some way out.

Torrents haven't destroyed the film industry, but they have certainly affected huge change by bringing in new streaming services like NetFlix, AmazonPrime, NowTV etc. The same pattern can be seen in the music industry with the likes of iTunes &amp; Spotify. These services have in essence found the sweet-spot that will deter most average consumers away from torrents. In the UK torrent usage has actually been on the slide due to a combination of streaming and enforcement action (i.e. most ISPs blacklisting torrent sites).
Now to use this as a basis to predict what will happen with bitcoin.. Firstly I would say that the fight is not just with banks but also with government, both of whom have a vested interest in stifling bitcoin and both of whom will work together for greater effect. The flip side to this is bitcoin does not have the same obvious legality issues that torrents have, so governments will need to use more tenuous means of suppression (typically through the money laundering regime) which will be costly and resource intensive. Bitcoin has seen a huge increase in merchant adoption in 2014 and 100s millions $ in VC money, so we will indeed have a big fight on our hands.
Eventually I believe the technology will triumph, as history has repeatedly shown. Bitcoin will not wipe out traditional banking and fiat currency, but it will provide people with a choice they never had before. Some banks will try to fight it hard, some will capitulate and a few may actually embrace it. Banks are getting hammered from all sides now, particularly in Europe with more stringent regulations and unfavourable rulings on past cases of wrong doing (Libor, PPI, FX rate fixing etc). I think Bitcoin may not be under their radar but still a tiny dot.

You see I think it's the other way around. Consumers dictate to merchants.. CC pricing is factored into all aspects of online commerce so businesses don't really use it as way to gain a competitive advantage, it's just a given. [This recent merchant survey]( showed that almost half of those businesses in the UK that enabled bitcoin payment options in the last 6 months have not made one single sale in bitcoin, why because it's not on the agenda for the average consumer.

You're looking at bitcoin as if it's a fully resolved product, it isn't and there's a long way to go. We're still in the early stages with this technology, but the long term potential of a decentralized peer-to-peer currency is huge.
Also you view this in a very binary way, as if it either has to be card or bitcoin, the two can in actual fact co-exist. You also overlook many of the other benefits of bitcoin as a store of value and a means of remittance. Being able to transfer value from one side of the world to the other for 6 cents is one of the most significant financial innovations of the last 20 years in my view.

VAT applies irrespective of whether it's an individual or business. It's dependent on whether that individual or corporate entity exceeds the VAT threshold which is currently set at £79,000.
As far as I am aware the individuals selling their Bitcoins in the UK using services like Bittylicious, Localbitcoins and Bitbargain are acting like a micro-exchange and would be subject to VAT on the full value of any BTC sold, but only if they exceed the above-mentioned VAT threshold and are thus legally required to become VAT registered. From what I can gather when the change comes into affect only the trading profits will be vatable.

I'm inclined to think that there is no magical protocol fix that can solve this tendancy to centralize.

Interesting post thanks! I would agree that Bluetooth seems to be the logical choice, NFC has been dying a slow death (I've had 3 phones now with NFC and I've never come across a useful app for it). Security is the big thing here but QR codes are far from secure. On the web they can easily be spoofed by some rogue browser extension/malware. In a retail point of sale (POS) setting I've heard of fraudsters just taping over their own QR code, low tech but it worked!
For anybody interested in reading up on the security considerations for Bluetooth [this StackExchange post is a good place to start!](
**EDIT:** We almost need to approach this problem separately for retail POS settings and just your regular buying online. The latter is interesting as generally people don't store their bitcoin on the device they're using to browse the web.

You guys in Germany are lucky, I think your banking sector has a more diverse base of smaller co-operative banks. Here in the UK there's really limited choice and they're all working hard to distance themselves from their customers.. Closing branches and routing people through tedious automated call centers, if you're lucky enough to speak to a human they will almost certainly be following some script. Of course automation is not all bad if it results in a saving for the consumer but it really annoys me how they still pretend to be your "Local Bank".

But aren't these two diametrically opposed under the current model? I.e. the miners will make more profit at the expense of network security and decentralization.

Where do you think the term "Too big to fail" comes from? If banks engage in reckless behavior they know the government will bail them out by printing more money. That safety net is removed and hence such market behaviors would be discouraged.
If some banks don't change their practices they will be made extinct. This is how markets should function. 


Auditors are employed by the bank so there's a conflict of interest right off the bat. You can also use all kinds of accounting tricks to obfuscate the bank's true financial position. Also this information is not available in real-time so it's of limited use.

Right now I'm not convinced that this is specifically a decentralization problem, more of a pooling problem. Smaller miners are incentivised to work in pools to get a more consistent return, but the actual geographic distribution of mining hardware is already quite spread.
Either way I think the centralization of mining via pools or hardware accumulation is a natural tendency that is going to be very difficult to overcome.

Sure, it basically limits how much you can draw down from BitPay at any one time. The limit is set at £1,000 for UK merchants whereas in the US I believe it's just $25. So UK merchants need to accumalate £1,000 in sales before they can extract it. Of course you can just hold in BTC, fine for those who are less risk averse but it's a serious downside for most UK merchants looking to dip their toes in the water.

Let's face it Bitstamp don't really care where your funds came from, it is of no commercial interest to them. This question is only there as part of the ridiculous AMLR procedures the government imposes upon on them. Regulators are rubbing their hands with glee, waiting for something to pin on them.. this non-nonsensical approach is Bitstamps way of protecting themselves from getting shut down and thrown in jail.
One of the principle areas of KYC is knowing where your clients funds originated from (or at least attempting to understand), that's why question 6 is there. Obviously it's crazy to think that any individual looking to launder a ton of money wouldn't have the chops to knock up a fake document on Photoshop :)
Unfortunately these actions are forcing users to switch to anonymous exchanges like BTC-e pushing bitcoin underground. So the regulators are ultimately shooting themselves in the foot. Any individual with criminal intent would always use BTC-e over Bitstamp so the whole thing is a complete waste of energy, but it does keep government bods employed, so not all bad news :)

You can't fabricate bitcoins from thin air, of course you can abstract all kinds of fancy financial services on top of bitcoin but it's very easy to independently audit through proof of reserves. The casino banking system I refered to would have a much harder time functioning under such conditions.


This is not a fair comparison, pools are very different to physical centralization. A pool is made up from a bunch of miners that are leasing out their hashing power to a central authority, it can easily be shifted around as was evident this last week. Even pool centralization is a problem but it's not as grave a situation as having one physical mining entity controlling a large share of the network.

A couple of things I'm not clear on regarding Storj. How do they solve the latency problem? If I have a file distributed across a number of other peoples HDDs, the service will need to ping them to see if they're online and in a position to deliver that file. When discovered the file still needs to be streamed and decrypted. The latency must be terrible? If the file is being sharded across multiple clients it would be even worse.
Also how many replica sets do they keep? Surely this number would need to be quite high to limit the possibility that all the users storing that file may be offline simultaneously?

I think bitcoin is actually highly inflationary right now and will only truly become deflationary years down the line. In terms of moving value from point A to point B, bitcoin is truly revolutionary. Although once the value has been moved you'd want to convert that asset into something more stable. That's why at this current stage in the lifecycle of bitcoin I feel remittances is it's killer app. Bitcoin is still very much in a price discovery phase, markets are irrational and speculation is rife.. for that reasons it's not going to make a great store of value. I'm sure this will change in the future but I cannot say when, it could be months...but most likely years. I don't think however it will every go to zero.

The answer is simple.. **Do your research**, not based on opinions but on technical analysis. Do you believe the Bitcoin protocol has a future? If you do buy/hold, if not sell. You can't make sound investment decisions by courting opinion on Reddit, only be carrying out your own thorough research.

It would certainly help. The interface between fiat and bitcoin still remains a significant hurdle in many developed countries, the UK included.

Economists are notorious for getting things wrong, their predictions are often no more accurate than if left to random selection.

I keep hearing how we're on the cusp of change in the UK as around 30 new banking licenses have recently been issued [(src)]( Before that I believe we had one banking licence issued in 100 years.
AFAIK the Faster Payments network is proprietary and owned by the big 4 banks, so they won't let the new guys in to play. Hopefully the government (or our EU overlords) will deem this to be anti-competitive and force them to open it up. I personally hate the way this country prides itself on being a financial hub, it's completely self-serving and has contributed to the widening wealth gap in the UK. It has also become a facilitator for rich criminals to launder their money.

I know people like to tout this analogy but it's a flawed comparison, email had very clear benefits over fax machines... no paper, no ink, faster transmission etc. Perhaps people didn't see those benefits at the time but they did exist. From a consumer perspective money is already digital, bitcoin doesn't solve any problems here (possibly with the exception of remittances), it just introduces risk with no upside. As an asset class bitcoin is far more interesting at this stage, let's be honest most people bought bitcoin as an "investment", not so they could go and pester every single merchant out there to provide them with a means to spend it. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 17:18:00
It's possible that the reason was due to some schoolboy error that if revealed would seriously bring into question their overall competence. It also could have been an inside job, again something they'd rather not go public with. Personally what I find odd (and somewhat revealing) is that they rebuilt their entire infrastructure in the cloud, this is something businesses would ordinary plan meticulously for months. Perhaps this is some indication that their physical servers had been compromised in some way that could easily happen again. This is pure speculation by the way, feel free to shoot it down!

They did bleed money but this was paralleled by exponential growth in their respective userbase. This is what keeps investors interested.
Bitcoin has really stalled in 2014/2015, There's no compelling reason for affluent consumers to ditch their credit cards, and it's still a pain in the arse to acquire and store. Right now new entrants are not sufficient in numbers to counter inflation. I would wait to see what happens in 2016 when the block reward is halved.

I agree, I'm sure they care. But unless they can develop an algorithmic way of resolving this, I think it will remain a necessary evil. By profitable I wasn't really referring to the yield from the ad but rather the prospect of manually vetting all ads or developing a complex algo based approach.
@_date: 2015-04-29 14:44:32
If they have a UK banking license then yes. These licenses are rarely ever issued. I know they applied in January so this announcement may signal that they have been accepted. There has been a lack of competition in the UK banking sector for decades. More recently the UK government have being looking at stimulating competition, so this could be very good news, not just for bitcoin but for wider innovation in the financial sector.

I wouldn't accept that, if they want to retain any facade of credibility they need to publish a "Root Cause Analysis". This is how you communicate that you have taken time to understand the full nature of the problem and implemented steps to mitigate in future. It is standard practice in businesses with less at stake than managing money.
Also they should be publishing ongoing proof of reserves. They are almost certainly running a fractional reserve right now. If they get hit again maybe next time they won't be in a position to make people whole.

They seem like reasonable objections to me. Bail-ins and bank runs akin to those in Cyprus are extremely unlikely to happen in the US anytime soon, however who knows in 5-10 years time?
In regards to holding the banks liable for loss, this is also correct. How comfortable would you feel holding multi-million dollar deposits with a Bitcoin company? If the losses were completely insured then this would be a non-issue. I'm not aware of any Bitcoin company fully insuring deposits?

One point I raised was that Governments would rather bitcoin didn't exist period and regulation is the only way they can assert some control. These overtures towards cryptocurrencies (from the UK Gov, Lawsky and his ilk) are somewhat disingenuous.

It depends on the jurisdiction. However in the UK at least it is not necessary to collect passports or government ID but rather to verify the identity of the individual, that's the objective. Any approach used needs to stand up in court if tested, e.g. was sufficient effort made to verify the customer's identity? Collecting passports and an accompanying form of ID is just the defacto way of handling this, particularly given the challenges of identity customers in multiple different countries. Even this system is really inadequate given how trivial it would be to knock up these documents on Photoshop, then again most regulators seem to operate as if we're still living in the 1980s.

Paper wallets when created correctly and **kept cold** are extremely safe, perhaps the safest means of long term bitcoin storage.
Sending to (not from) a cold storage address it not an issue and in no way weakens it's security, irrespective of how many times you send funds to that address.
I think regarding your final point, creating the wallet offline and BIP38 encoding it is important. I used a downloaded version of bitaddress.org to do this and completely air gapped my PC. There are probably additional steps you can take to verify the code has not been tampered with in transit, perhaps someone else could advise here?
Also think about where you will store your BIP38 password? To mitigate against fire &amp; theft take a copy of the paper wallet on some form of media that won't degrade over time. I think if you follow these steps you'll be very safe!
And of course don't spend from your cold wallet as it will then no longer be cold.

It's good that those who care about privacy actually have a choice now. However most people outside the Reddit echo chamber don't give a rats arse about privacy or have even really bothered to comprehend the long term consequences. When Bitcoin wins it won't be on the basis of privacy, not unless public perception about privacy  vs protecting citizens swings radically the other way. I really can't see this happening in the next 2-3 years, certainly not against the backdrop of ISIS and global terrorism,  which is making it more favourable than ever for governments to push through Draconian laws that diminish people's right to privacy.
