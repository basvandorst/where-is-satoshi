I have the same begrudging realization. I hope it's just because bitcoin is so young, but it's really turned into the wild west scaremongering picture that pro-regulation people like to put up.

Sites like these is like an extra tax only for stupid people.

Nobody knows. But aren't you happy that your taxdollars are supporting it?

You also have to factor in the cost of capital.
