I have one BTC too. The segwith BTH discussion made my weak hand sell at 2k and rebuy at 2400 though. Lol.

I still haven't got my BCC on kraken. How long will it take for them to implement it?

Let's see what the next ''scaling'' debate around oct/nov will bring. I foresee another correction around then. To which I hope to buy more BTC.

I am waiting for a major pump and dump by either Jacob Rothschild or wallstreet. I will buy up more BTC if the price drops due to this.

I agree, with last week's correction BTC took almost all of the altcoins with him.

I have not yet heard from a statement from kraken about their measures on 1 august to guaranty safety to its BTC users. Same with bitstamp. Only coinbase emailed me.
PS I am active on a lot of exchanges/wallets for my job.

Trackers? Not my thing.

Ethereum has been quite stable lately since that hack. I think it will not move over €200 in the upcoming weeks.

You could always store your private key on a hard wallet if you are scared of exchanges being hacked. Or consider other forms of cold storage. BTW most known hardware wallets like trezor have extremely high shipment costs/lead time at the moment because of the current BTC situation. 
I used to own 100 Ethereum before their blockchain split. I bought them for €8 each at the time and sold them for €12 each (LOL) I thought I made a nice profit but in the end I didn't. So if you have a nice amount of ethers I'd focus on the long(er) term now and try to save the private key offline.

Yo I have a 1 BTC and about $1000 on kraken. Do you guys think there will be a small dip right before august 1st? I hope to be able to buy atleast another 0.5 BTC for the $1k that I have left unspend.

I am a customer service representive/text writer for a small crypto currency exchange. We provide a locally used payment method that the larger exchanges don't have. Many of my customers have different wallets and I try to sign up to most of the well known wallets/exchanges to help them if they have questions.

In a period of a couple hours that's a lot.

Seriously bitcoin went to almost €2.5k and now it's back to €2.35k this currency is extremely volatile. I mean after it was almost certain that the BIP91 lock-in was reached.

What's the big deal about Jacob Rothschild investing into BTC? I am only afraid that he might pump and dump a  large amount of BTC. But in the end there's always the market cap. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:12:53
This should have little to o impact to  the crypto currency values. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:45:52
I bought my BTC for €2300...... yesterday on kraken :s 
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:46:19
I bought .25 BTC with a limit order. The price went up directly after execution. This currency is extremely volatile. Too bad I wasn't quick enough with my order would've loved to ride this small wave.
