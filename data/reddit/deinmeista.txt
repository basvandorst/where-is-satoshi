With the current fluctuations in prices, how should that ratio really help to identify how the market is doing?
Furthermore if we have a slow trading day on the exchanges it falsly looks like people spent more outside of them.
It would be interesting to know:
* Market Cap (includes price)
* # Currencies tradeable in exchanges (our world wide reach without the dollar as an intermediary)
* amounts traded in each currency
* Adoption Speed (# new merchants per week)
* Media Coverage (# news articles, google searches)
* Decentralization of Mining 
* Decentralization of Trading/Financial Services
* if possible turnover of sold products (?through bitpay and competitors)
did i forget something?

Drop the "The."  Just "Bitcoin." It's cleaner.

hey its good but its kind of long for the reddit attention span, 
could you cut out the looking and walking part and just have the hand twice, once upvote once bitcointip
still great work though :D

agree. though has the growth in price to be in a sustainable manner. We are just now expanding usability, which makes the current price more realistic. It still exploded from 3 months ago and with more adaption will probably soon again have some ups and downs

sounds like an interesting idea. so like some sort of bank account to which you can make transfers and add the bitcoin adress as useage... 
it directly buys and transfers the amout of money in bitcoins to the wallet
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:55:03
No you got confused there a little bit.
They trade in USD, so you can sell Dollars for Bitcoins.
What they automatically convert are the Euros-&gt; Dollar, you wrote that you are in Germany so I assumed you will use Euros. 
As soon as you buy Bitconis for Dollars, they are frist on the Bitstamp server, but you can withdraw them immediately to another wallet if that's what you want.

we already had this tread a few days ago.
The conclusion was that it is way to early for such a big company.
If you personally want to buy steamgames already you might want to use 
People wrote positive reviews, but I haven't tried it.

As an intermediary of flight tickets they give out the flight tickets immediately and claim that you have to sort out problems with the airline itself. 
They hid the extra costs illeagally in the AGB so I could only fight them and the airline for using them when I now do chargeback.
Those cases could be made easier with better online consumer rights like in the US but as a country that dosn't use that much credit card payments this is not here yet :/
TLDR A chargeback would make the airline go after me

The thing is as this is just people that like to throw money around like crazy, the concept of Bitcoin is the same and still valuable and well.
Here you see a Bubble bursting as people speculated on the price and not on the functionality. I am still very much thinking that Bitcoin has a place in the market, buying things from Bitcoinstore might be one thing. But especially for creating websites where you want to pay small amount of money for access without giving you're credit card information to everyone.
It's a good concept. Just people are greedy. I know I will buy from Bitcoinstore when I'm in the US again. Because
1) for a short trip (under 2 months) I can't make a new Bank account
2) I will most likely want to buy stuff and going to overpriced retail shops is not really my thing, I want to buy online, using bitcoins when there are stores everywhere I will be able to do as a tourist with a short term adress in many places over the world.
Bitcoins have big potential, it's just overhyped at the moment... the new gold? Kind of a stupid idea to say something that can be replaced short to medium term by a better technology is gold wait and see if it catches on and help the shops out because the idea is a great thing

Hello! As somebody currently residing in Colombia. 
It might be informative, but I don't know how to get Bitcoin here. From my experience many young tech-savy Colombians don't have a Bank Account, and If they do they often have to activate Online Transfers extra.
Secondly, I haven't found any good BTC/COP exchanges.
Can you or somebody tell me the best place to buy Bitcoins with Colombian Pesos (COP)? 
I just know
bitmarket.co - which looks a little scatchy, and
localbitcoins - Where few people offer Bitcoins here, and no one in my Area

True furthermore
Bitstamp.net holds your funds in Dollars and trades in Dollars while 
Bitcoin.de uses Euros
Not a big difference, because Bitstamp converts your money for free, but still good to mention.

Now that Bitcoin-24.com is down I rather think they will get even more customers... we need good alternatives

A trusted intermediary like that could also very well exist in the Bitcoin world especially for larger payments.
So according to their website in german they tell you that they are excempt from the telesell guidlines and tickets can't be cancelled after payment.
There is a law in the US that states that flight tickets can be canceled in the first 24h for free but that doesn't exist in that way in Germany.
Now I either can call their customer service which charges extra or cancel it with my credit card company and see what happens :/
I don't think that credit cards come out better in this case.
