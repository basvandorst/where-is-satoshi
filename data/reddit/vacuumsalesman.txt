Seems pointless to run a full node if you can't use it.

without the miners and exchanges?

Do you think it is government actors or corporate actors? Why would they do it?

I have to agree with Greg on a lot more than just this.

AskReddit isn't a large part of the FPH crowd. In fact, they supported admins during the FPH drama.

Your point has no effect on the analogy. The fact is the same. We are considering a big change with substantial risk to a very expensive project if executed poorly.

Extremely thorough testing on test net is necessary, but that hasn't been done yet.

Imagine you're flying a plane worth $4 billion dollars. Since you can't land, you have to upgrade the engines in flight. It's too risky to just upgrade them without understanding what might happen because it might be too late to downgrade them after a few hundred kilometers. Instead, you should take great care in making sure that the upgrade has zero chance of catastrophic impacts.

Your mistake is in assuming that reddit will suddenly stop fucking things up. Even after this drama blows over, more drama is just around the corner.

I learned my lesson when I spent a bunch of money spooling up XT nodes back when everybody was saying the fork was going to happen any day, but they were just faking everything. Now I just have a Core node.
@_date: 2015-09-08 23:49:11
I spent $200 to run 10 XT nodes for a month and never saw any DDOS activity. I won't renew them and I just reinstalled Bitcoin Core at home. XT was a big waste of time and money for me.
@_date: 2015-09-09 11:28:54
It wasn't a single bitcoin node. It was 10 at $20 per month. I don't know of any VPS that can run a full node for $2 per month like you say. Like I said, I am already running Bitcoin Core at home. I took the XT nodes offline because I think they are lying about how much support it has.
@_date: 2015-09-05 12:51:35
Mine are all real, but I'm not renewing my VPS after the month is up. It's a waste of resources since most of the support was fake anyways.
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:54:37
The image is misleading. It was made at the height of the XT pump. A lot of those were fake and the number is dropping because people like me are realising that XT is a waste of time and not renewing their VPSs.
@_date: 2015-09-08 23:26:09
I am running Satoshi 11 at home after uninstalling XT. I'm taking 10 XT VPS nodes offline because I don't see the point in renewing them for another month. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 22:39:52
How much of that is XT?

They just barely got trounced by Coinbase about the 'fully regulated bitcoin exchange' too.

@_date: 2015-10-18 16:02:30
I used to run 10 BitcoinXT nodes until I realised I wasted money on a cause that I didn't even support. I bought into the XT hype but it's all bullshit. My XT nodes expired and now I just run my Core node.

I would use bitaddress.org and do it myself. Are you using BIP38? 
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:03:27
You need to use an offline computer to do it right. Like maybe an Ubuntu LiveCD.
