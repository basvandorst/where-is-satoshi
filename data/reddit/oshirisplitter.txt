Considering that transactions are essentially flat records with flat fields autonomous of other transactions and are indexed by two flat keys, I actually think it's a viable, if not good, choice.

I think the article is talking about search integration, not about beung able to search for a link to do the conversion for you.
Much like typing in "20 usd in jpy" in google. It would give you the conversion as one of the search results. No need for another clickthrough.
I dont know about you but that sounds mighty convenient to me.

&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;body ng:app="gox" ng:controller="main"&gt;
&lt;script src="angular.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
Here you go man. Lovingly coded in angular.

You can't really "moderate" ignorance, at least not in the sense of ignorance to bitcoin. It boils down to having a personal opinion on bitcoin, and while it may be misinformed, it's a perfectly valid opinion to not swear by bitcoin. No reason to pull down posts for it.
At least until the post actually comes off as derogatory, you know what i mean? Like "bitcoin adopters can suck my dick" or something.

Not to add to iOS bashing, but having to copy and paste something like a btc address or key is in itself a very wide open security vulnerability, not just in phones.
