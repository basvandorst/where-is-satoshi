It's better than paper if you wish to write-down your recovery phrase on a safe place

Agree, but it's like all credit/debit cards. It's handy to keep your wallet keys on a pretty way. 
You can use it as a gift.

We created these cards to introduce bitcoin as a gift. Yes, there is an online store and we sell them. But the idea is not to sell them on Reddit. We would like only to share our work.
I didn't know that there is something similar. Please, share a link. Thank you!

Probably, the best possible gift ever :) Great Idea!
We have a very similar product to gift Bitcoins at CoinCardGift.com

Yes, that's correct. The giver knows the seed word, but actually, there is no other way to give bitcoin with a wallet to a newbie.
We believe that the giver will not keep a copy of the recovery phrase/private key. It's a gift, and in most cases, it will be for a nice occasion. 
Also, the receiver can always move the Bitcoin to another wallet/BTC address.
We introduce Bitcoin for a very long time, and we see that the best way someone to understand Bitcoin is to have some amount. And the easiest way to do that is to gift it.
It's worth it, instead of buying unnecessary accessories. We think some of the best occasions are New Baby Born, Wedding, Birthday, etc.
What do you think? Is it too risky?

Guys, thanks a lot for your help! Really appreciate it! 
If any of you wish a discount, just let me know. The cards already have free shipping worldwide.

Bitcoin is a Lifestyle :) Welcome on Board

It's a Gift Card as Cold Storage for any Bitcoin wallet. We're not a wallet, and we do not choose the BTC address. The Card above is just an example with a demo address.
Let me explain it further:
You have a wallet with your private keys (we don't ask for them, which is normal) and during the order, you can add a Bitcoin address from your wallet (whatever it is).
For example:
1. You have a Bitcoin wallet from Green Address
2. Once you make the order of a card by your choice, there is a field to add the bitcoin address
3. Then we generate the QR code (just to fit the card design, and you can always check that it's correct)
4. The Card will come only with your Bitcoin address (+QR Code +Custom text if you wish) from your current wallet (like Green Address, Trezor, Ledger)
5. Then you can write down the recovery phrase on the Backside of your Card along with the private key. We send each Card with a permanent marker for this purpose.
You can also add a custom wish/text to your Card. These Cards have the idea to introduce Bitcoin to someone else (as a gift), but you can keep it for you.
It's a gift card for wallet by your choice.

Your Keys, Your Coins :) 
This address is just an example. In general, you can add an address from any Bitcoin wallet. It is impossible to get a card without submitting a BTC address.
These plastic cards are Cold Storage Solution for Any Wallet, and we do not ask for your private keys. Each card comes with a permanent marker (to write-down the recovery phrase on the backside) and a protective case.

We have a birthday card. This one is just an example. Yes, it's mostly for corporate gift.
Our cards are made to introduce Bitcoin to anyone. 
Thank you

Thank you!
It makes sense. The QR code is really small.
About the address, on the backside is the recovery phrase along with the private key (if you wish to add them once the card is delivered).
Really good point, thanks!

I agree, but in this case, it's necessary for the receiver to have a bitcoin wallet. If it's a first time Bitcoin user, it's almost impossible.
We'll continue to search for a solution.
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:47:18
Yes, exactly!

You can add the private key on the Backside. We don't ask for it during the order (you know why).  The card comes with a permanent marker so you can add the private key on the Backside along with the recovery phrase.
I'll add an image how the back looks
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:44:05
Looks promising :) So we have 2 years left to 250k
What's life after Moon?

Thank you very much! Really appreciate your feedback!
The front has only a Bitcoin address, Not the private key. Is that what you mean?
We stick to 'Your Keys, Your Coins'
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:52:00


Thank you!
There is a protective case, but we don't know the private key (and we don't ask for it). It's a gift card as cold storage for any wallet. 
The idea is to submit a bitcoin address of wallet by your choice. When you have the card, you can add the recovery phrase/private key on the backside (we also send a permanent marker).
Then you can send some Bitcoins to this address, and gift it to anyone.
During the order, you can add custom text, wishes, or anything else.

Thanks for your question! I'll explain it:
How it works:
1. The Front has a Bitcoin address given by you during the order. Then we'll generate a relevant QR Code to fit with card design 
2. The back is empty during the order. The card comes with a permanent pencil and then you can write-down the 24-word recovery phrase along with the private key (only if you wish)
3. We do not require sensitive information about the wallet. The idea is to give a cold storage wallet as a bitcoin gift card.
We think that there is no better gift these days. Like a wedding gift of 0.1BTC, and the couple may keep it for the next 5-10 or more years. It's the same for a New Baby, Personal Gift, etc.
It's better than paper, and the private keys are not processed in any digital method.

It will be an insane moment when Bitcoin goes to $100,000
