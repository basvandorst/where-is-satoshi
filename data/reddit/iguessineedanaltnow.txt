Bought in at 13K because I was convinced we were going to 100K+. When it plummeted I moved that money into Electroneum hoping for a quick turnaround on a low dollar coin. That tanked. Have now bought back into Bitcoin after taking that massive loss and am playing the market differently.

Thats.. weird. What would someone have to gain from that?
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:51:49
Lol true but I bought it like 2 weeks ago
@_date: 2019-10-24 09:26:56
I'm considering buying more right now but I have a bunch of big bills coming up and a move in two months. If it balloons before January though I look like a genius. Decisions, decisions.

So we rocket up to 10K and now the price is slowly creeping back to to possibly below 9K by the end of today. Weird.

That makes a lot of sense. So if it goes past 10K thats a good bench mark for faith in bitcoin?

What's the cause for the resistance?

Dont have a grand to drop right now but just put in a purchase myself. Glad I bought the 7K dip earlier this month.

I'm gonna cut my losses before the value of my portfolio falls to $0 and take all the money from bitcoin and put it into the stock market lol

Once the price gets low enough I'll buy a few hundred again as well
@_date: 2019-12-18 08:42:41
I'd wager most of this sub doesn't have more than a couple hundred invested. The average is possibly even lower than that
@_date: 2019-12-18 01:18:46
Eh, just gonna dump at a loss at this point before it gets lower. I'll buy more when it gets below 1K perhaps but I'm tired of buying and holding an asset that has never given me a profit. If I had invested all the money I've put into bitcoin into apple stocks I'd be up money right now
@_date: 2019-12-18 03:00:27
It could be. And if I see the price hovering around this current level for a while I will throw a few hundred back in. I've given up on caring about predictions when predictions a month or so ago said we would rocket past 10K up to 13K and beyond and everyone was saying "10K is the new floor". As soon as I saw what the returns I could have gotten in the stock market which is doing really well were I got discouraged.

Bought at $8,500, $9,300, and then $8,200 this year alone. After every purchase it went down in price. I'll buy again when it bottoms out.
