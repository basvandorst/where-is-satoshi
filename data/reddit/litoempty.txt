Doing my research on paper wallets, private keys, public keys, etc. right now.  I have lots of googling and youtubing to do.  I really have a lot to learn. Any tips for a good starting point?  I just dont understand the key infrastructure and how wallet keys and everything work.

I dont mind the interface from what I have seen, I have only made an account so I have not yet looked too much into it.  Interface is really not a huge deal to me as much as reliability, security, functionality, etc.
Where did you see this news about the exchanges receiving funding? I would be interested in reading that.  I am not going to hold my breath on how long that will be though...

I agree that not every public event is correlated to price, however, a change from 125 to 100 is pretty big.  1/5 of the price changing usually means something happened in the world of finance/currency/money/business/etc

If regulation occurs, it wont be for a while...and there will be so many cracks and holes in the regulation because of the nature of the beast...bitcoin was created not to be regulated.

so you like CampBX?  Tell me about it!!! It is hard to find any user feedback which is why I made my original post. I did however find plenty on Gox...word on the street is that it is slow and unreliable which is why I am going for CampBX
