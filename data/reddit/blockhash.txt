We just found out about the site today. We had a user email us asking for clarification, and if we owned the .net site.
Of course, the .net site's whois is registered under: "Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc."
Anyways, we've contacted our lawyers and are working to get them shut down. In the mean time, this is meant to be a warning so no one else gets scammed.

Hey guys,
I didn't want to launch this until tomorrow, once I've had a chance to automate the full chain of events, but since the topic of Amazon has come up, I'll give it a mention :)
I made a site to trade BTC for Amazon gift cards. The gift cards are in e-card form, so you can spend them immediately, and they get sent out as soon as I receive verified payment.
I'll be automating the giftcard sending tomorrow (my day off), and officially launching, but if you guys want to check out the site, send me a PM and I'll link you.
If not, keep your eyes out tomorrow for the official launch!

Brian from AmazonBitcoins here.
I just want to clarify the review situation, since it seems there is some confusion. 
The BitcoinMaster's review was in no way a paid review.
When launching sites that require trust to use, there ends up being a bit of a chicken and the egg problem. Having lots of successful transactions builds trust, but in order to reach that, you need to have the help of early adopters.
Eddie and I reached out to some of the better bloggers in the Bitcoin community to allow them a first view at the site, and to write up their thoughts. 
We sent TBCM bitcoins to try out the site, so that he could get a full picture of the end to end experience a customer would have when using it. **We** however kept the gift code after he had a chance to use the site. The Bitcoins we sent were purely a mechanism for him to get a realistic use of the site.
Hope that clears things up!

Hey guys, 
Brian from amazonbitcoins here. We'd love to hear the communities thoughts and feedback on the site. 
You can try out the site with as little as a $1 gift card. Right now that's just ~.036 BTC.

Agreed. In fact, I built a proto-type of this tonight. I'll be launching this Saturday. Keep your eyes out for a post :)

Don't forget Amazon :) 
&lt;shameless&gt;The site I just launched lets you buy amazon giftcards with bitcoin&lt;/shameless&gt;

Hey guys,
I'm working on a twitter based bitcoin tipper. I'm nearing completion on it, and it will be released tomorrow night! 
Lookout for awesome launch specials, including free BTC in the accounts of the first 100 people who signup! 
I hope that bitcoins can be adopted as a currency for good, removing it as being seen as only a way to pay for drugs and gambling. Rather lets make it useful for showing love for awesome content, like music, art, and open source software!
