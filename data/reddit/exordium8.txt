A fraction of a second is still a long time when it comes to the stock market. I mean, people paid $500m to run a fiberoptics cable directly from New York to Chicago to shave 3 milliseconds off the time it takes news to arrive.

There's a reason they changed it in 1981, that method was pretty terrible. Hell, even the CPI is pretty terrible at measuring inflation, which is why we're gradually switching over to CPCE from the CPI. I mean come on, at 10% inflation you'd be saying prices in general for everything are 2.5 times higher today than in 2004.
Also, bonus points if you can tell me why exactly the 1981 method was so bad.

There is a massive reduction in incentive instantly instead of a very gradual reduction over 4 years

The last time the inflation rate was 10% was 1981. This year, it's looking to be around 2%.
Let's try to stick to facts.

I do like how your argument us that nothing has changed. Except for the most important part of bitcoin. But that doesn't count.
@_date: 2014-04-05 15:55:18
Oh no, bitcoin won't be around forever, that much is obvious. It's a fun little experiment, but it's too flawed to be a serious currency.
People are treating bitcoin emotionally, as opposed to as a commodity, which is a major issue with it. You never mix money and emotions, that's how people lose everything.
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:44:51
It's actually about buying a security/commodity that has experienced a large drop in a very short amount of time. You buy in hopes that it'll rebound and you'll make a killing.
Sure, you buy during a dip, but a commodity losing two thirds of it's value in three months is not a dip.
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:11:05
To be fair, when capitalism implodes we won't need bitcoin (or indeed, any currency) anymore. There's no need for currency when you are provided with everything you need by the state, which will be easy enough to do once we redistribute resources away from the rich/corporations and to those who need them.
Bitcoin is just a way to hurry along the demise of currency.

The price. You know, the main reason a lot of people bothered to invest in the first place?
@_date: 2014-07-11 00:55:39
You can invest in tens of thousands of individual stocks, over a thousand ETFs, REITS, Bonds, mutual funds, options, futures, convertibles, and everything in between. Hell, you don't even need to invest in listed stocks, you can still buy unlisted shares (penny stocks are the most well-known of these).
Pretty much the only things you can't buy into is private companies, due to the inherent risk (enough people lost all their money to scams and then killed themselves that the SEC restricted who can invest) but even that is coming down.
Also, if you had a reliable method of determining when a stock is "overpriced" you'd be sipping a drink on your private jet right now, not posting on reddit.
Basically what I'm saying is you're full of shit.
@_date: 2014-01-07 03:43:54
I'm calling bullshit on this. No one outside bitcoin "enthusiasts" calls currency "fiat", because pretty much every currency (including bitcoin) is a fiat currency. People just use the word fiat to sound edgy.

Not only is this not about bitcoin, but holy shit some of those numbers are crazy. The Roman Empire ended in 180 A.D.? No Holy Roman Empire/Byzantine Empire? How about Egypt? The Han Dynasty? Carthage?
Actually, looking at this, most of these "life spans" are just dates selected to make a point, and don't represent life spans of empires at all.

A lot of people haven't heard the phrase "Don't try to catch a falling knife" either, but that doesn't fit your agenda now, does it?
@_date: 2014-08-12 04:42:24
It included volatile goods, such as fuel and food, whose price relies on more than inflation. The price of fuel is more dependent on geopolitical forces than inflation, and food is mostly subject to the whims of nature. These two goods were a huge part of inflation calculations up until the 1980s.
Also, the basket of goods used to calculate the CPI, up until the 80s, was recalculated once a decade. As you can imagine, this had several problems (tastes change in a decade, so the basket at the end of the period may not be reflective of what people are actually purchasing). These days, it is recalculated once a year.
It's really up to each person's judgement whether this is an effort to more accurately reflect inflation (which I believe) or whether it is creative bookkeeping.

Index funds can be basically any combination of stocks you like. Usually they're more diverse than "all oil stocks", but you certainly can choose index funds that lose a bunch of money if you try hard enough.

I agree. Bitcoin killing piracy would be a reason not to support it imo. Pirating video games/movies doesn't hurt anyone, and in the end can be seen as a positive as it exposes your content to people who otherwise wouldn't consume it due to the price. 
What I would like to see is some way for bitcoin to make piracy easier, with a way to easily tip the creators if you enjoy the content. Thats what we should be moving towards.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:30:46
Depends on the content creators. For example, I enjoy giant bombs content, so I have a premium subscription to their site and I regularly buy merchandise to support them. It's not exactly tipping, but it's as close as I can get.

Since it is Christmas and all, I'll give you a hint. Being all cheery sarcastic when you get called out for being an idiot just makes you look worse. 
e: nevermind, you think bitcoin has intrinsic value. You're one of those idiots who are immune to the bullets of logic and reason.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:39:43
Fiat actually means "let it be done" or "it shall be" in Latin, not "by decree". However, as a currency without intrinsic value, it is by definition a fiat currency given the modern meaning of fiat, so the Latin isn't really relevant.

The audience for bitcoin seems to be 49.5% speculators, 49.5% libertarian nuts, and 1% actually interested in bitcoin for the future. Honestly, I feel bad for all those in on bitcoin for the technology/future, because articles like this on make people who are into bitcoin look like crazies.
