Conspicuous consumption and display of resources is very effective and common evolutionary tactic. In many many cases it is the primary or sole purpose of acquiring resources. Peacocks, and in some ways, blockchain proof-of-work are both excellent examples of this phenomenon.

Bitcoin is a technology not an ideology. It was created to solve a problem not to further a cause. Did its creator have an ideology? Most people do, so one would assume so. Was that the main reason bitcoin was created? The white paper doesn't seem to indicate that. Yes, the distributed blockchain solved a problem with a centralized system by replacing it with a decentralized one. Many decentralized systems have advantages over centralized ones. Does that mean that all centralized systems are bad? Only if you are incredibly obtuse. Increased centralization can solve problems. Decreased centralization can also solve problems. Ideologies just piss people off. 
(OK, actually that's not true, ideologies can be solutions to problems as well. Just very annoying ones.)
The point is, technology (including bitcoin) is amoral. It has no beliefs, no cause. It is an ever expanding toolset that can be used for whatever applications people can think of to use it for; even as a mascot for your cause if you want. Which, in the case of general libertarianism is actually pretty justifiable as it does lend creedence to the individualist ethos. But don't be surprised or feel like you can in any way deter them when other's use it to further their own ends or trumpet their own ideals even when they are antithetical to yours.

I am more and more of the opinion that executive privilege overseen by democratic override and veto power is the way to go for most  democractic system (including the USA). As in let the president decide using discretion based on precedent and personal philosophy. If there is significant after the fact disagreement with any given decision, the enfranchised members can vote to overrule or even censure the executive in the case of any determined wrongdoing. Basically let leaders lead (with guidance) but know that there is accountability out there somewhere if they go too far. There doesn't need to (and can't) be a rule for everything.

The hassle is a one time thing, once you're hooked up to an exchange it's fairly easy and will only get easier over time. whereas that 5% advantage will never go away, unless credit card companies themselves start using blockchain currencies themselves.

What? Nice rule. Idioms are illogical almost by definition. 
"Try and" is simply an elision (as most idioms are) of a longer phrase "try and see" or "try it(x) and see what happens". 
People, myself included, use "try and" a) because it sounds better than multiple sequential hard Ts (to try to) and b) because it has a different connotation than "try to".
 "Try to" emphasizes the act of trying: I'm going to TRY to do it. "try and", in my opinion, emphasizes the uncertain nature of the outcome regardless of the actors ability to execute. Subtle difference, but try and listen to the way that people use "try and" and I bet you'll see it. And then, perhaps, your whole pedantic, rule-bound, prescribed universe will come crashing down in a glorious hail of chaotic creativity, confusion and open-mindedness. Perhaps.

That ad was actually very successful at the time it was run. Somehow, at this point in time I don't see it capturing the same feeling as it did then. Bitcoin is in a bit of a rockier place than it was then so something more serious would probably be in order. 
That ad was submitted by a random user, if you have an idea about what kind of message would speak to the reddit audience, who at this point is pretty well aware of Bitcoin but may harbor a number of reservations, then by all means make it. If people like it, I'm sure whoever is the trustee of those funds would be happy to use them to run your ad.

Fair enough. I guess we all (btc holders) get paid in a way for promoting bitcoins. It's one of bitcoins greatest strengths actually (and one of its more annoying weaknesses as well). We are all PR pitchmen now.
I actually think the last few weeks have seen some amazing news for bitcoin. Real world adoption and use (the only thing that really matters) seems to be growing like mad. The rest of the stuff are minor, temporary, expected setbacks. But keep fighting the good fight, rallying the troops and educating the masses. The day will come soon enough when we won't have to shout anymore. We'll get there in a few more years.

I guess I should apologize. I have this annoying habit of using loaded words according to my own definitions of them, which tends to freak people out. I know Marx put out the definitive word on what communism(tm) means but really he was just putting a new name (with a few strident flourishes) on a very old idea which was that of community or communalism or communism. 
In my above post I equated communism with cooperation, and it essentially is, but really that's not precise enough. Maybe I should have expressed it in terms of ego expansion and contraction. Capitalism or accounting, with IOUs, banknotes, contracts, wages, interest rates, is a way of abstracting or in a way digitizing natural human interactions. This removes the human element from relationships and puts them purely in the realm of dollars. This is very useful because it standardizes and systematizes human endeavor so it can all be coordinated into single mechanizable entity we generally call capitalism. But in that translation from reality to abstraction a lot of important things are stripped out. The biggest one being human relationships. I'll give you an example. My brother in law is a cattle rancher, he spends a huge amount of his time not doing his own work but constantly helping others. Now in a purely capitalistic, everything-is-accounted-for, system this would be a stupid self-defeating thing to do, but it's not. By helping others and asking nothing in return, he is expanding his ego, his self, to in include those he has helped so they too now act in a way that reflects the fact that his interests are now their interests as well. They help him just as much. And charging money for that help would be as silly as charging yourself money for doing work for you. This is what I call communism, voluntary and not forced, but still communism. Even if he would kill me if he heard me say that., And this is the fairy dream of communism, where everyone just works and helps and holds hands. Of  course it doesn't really work on nation scales with millions or billions of rational actors. But in a small enough coordinated enough group it does work. 
I was only gonna write a short reply but then I just kept going. I'll stop now.

This is an interesting post. It basically says that Bitcoin is better served by communism than by capitalism. Or, to put it in more general terms, by cooperation instead of competition. This is a question that all organizations, from nations down to individual families, must face; and there is no discrete right or wrong answer. Generally, however, the smaller a group is (in terms of discrete members) the more they favor cooperation. This is because, on operational terms, cooperation is always more effective than competition. Working together is better than working separately or against each other. The reason why this advantage breaks down more and more the larger a group gets is not in terms of ability but in terms of motivation. As a group gets larger, the benefits of my individual hard work gets split between more and more members.  The more members, the more incentive there is to attempt to cheat as a defector, thus making the hard workers more leery of contributing their resources without an expectation of anything in return. Making them more individualistic and appreciative of sole ownership of their own output.
As far as the bitcoin economy goes, it is hard to say where we are in terms of the advantages gained by cooperation and mutualism vs the dilution of motivation due to diverse and porous group membership. I think the poster is correct in saying there is underutilized value in cooperation in the Bitcoin nation and we could be well served by a shift towards mutualism. There is no way to say for sure. This is the whole point though of having articles like this, and indeed of having philosophers in general; to push people out of stagnant and maybe suboptimal thinking patterns and to reassess their relationship with broader society. 
Will the average bitcoin member see more advantage from helping the system as a whole or from helping himself? The answer is, of course, it depends.

It's an interesting discussion to be sure. Numbers are funny and can be emotionally deceptive; as are words. I do think going to the moon was worth it. I also would bet that the vast majority of taxpaying Americans at the time would have agreed, both before and certainly after the fact. I think you're right. If we had asked everyone to hand over $500 worth of 1960s dollars in lump sums it would have been a flop. Which then begs the question (in the non-technical, totally reasonable use of that phrase) if people wouldn't have individually universally pulled out their checkbooks to support a project which, in the end, they are ultimately happy with the completion of, is that not an argument that individual group member veto power over the allocation of resources towards projects that would result in a great number of desirable and 'good' outcomes never coming to pass is a net loss. And does that mean that therefore a government that has no ability to force a decision on large expenditures is a less desirable government because of its inability to provide desirable things. I'm sure you disagree because you don't think going to the moon was worth it, but it's interesting. Mostly I'm arguing with myself here.

I would suggest messaging Neo and Bee the Bitcoin bank in Cyprus. The founder is Danny They are planning on aggressively expanding into greater Europe. They have full merchant and payment solutions including a form of bitcoin debit card. They also have (are in the process of) converting the entire University of Nicosia to Bitcoin acceptance; tuition, books, student service, bars presumably. So they have more experience than anyone else in that particular area. They could also probably let your administrators talk to UofN admins as well if they had any questions or concerns.

This is fantastic. But you got the name backwards. Pledge bitcoins sounds like a charity drive. It really should be acceptbitcoins.com or some variation thereof. If I am a business thinking about taking bitcoins I am going to search for something along the lines of "taking,accepting, bitcoins" and if I find a site, or even receive communications from a site called "pledge bitcoins" I am going to dismiss it as someone looking for my money to give to charity. 
Again almost everything about this except the name is perfect. If you are stuck with it now, at least take some measures to mitigate the potential confusion and lack of obviousness.

Not really, the restriction in supply that would happen if someone essentially offered $5,000,0000,000 USdollars for sale in exchange for bitcoins at a price that could actually fill the offer in a reasonable amount of time, would drive the general trading price of bitcoins up probably several orders of magnitude. Something like $10k or $100k per coin would be the result with a vastly increased market cap to match.

I've been thinking about the same sort of thing for a long time.  I think, if you tried to set it up as a donation to the actual legislator you might get into some lobbying laws. What I was thinking about was more along the lines of projects. You want a road built in your town? Set up a fund. You want x program? set up a fund. If the account gets big enough it shows that people care about it. 
I was actually thinking of something like this, but as a a total replacement form of government. It would be much more complex and radical than what you are proposing, but in many ways it would be the same thing.

Pet peeve: comparing two things that are different is the purpose of comparison or analogy. Comparing two things that are exactly the same is pointless.
But ignore that for now. Moving on to your argument as I understand it:
Bitcoin wasn't "designed" for any particular implementation. It is an abstract solution to a fairly abstract problem. The means by which bitcoin focused organizations and companies have implemented this technology have been widely varied and tailored to the specific problems that that particular organization wished to solve; ranging from online exchanges, to localbitcoins, to debit card systems, and yes even to prototype dumbphone sms implementations.
 Even as SMS was a brilliant abstract solution to an abstract problem and Mpesa a brilliant application of that technology to the specific problems of Africa, so could the application of blockchain proof-of-work currency to the specific problems in Africa (or any region where value transfer is important and currently imperfect) potentially yield significant positive advancements if people are willing to tackle the problem. 
What you are essentially suffering from is a failure of imagination. You see bitcoin as it currently is and think because it doesn't fit into a different situation that it can't fit into another situation. Work will need to be done. Smart people will have to do smart things and try things that other people will call stupid or impossible but there are lots of smart people in the world and lots of things (including bitcoin itself) which people have called stupid or impossible which now are fundamentally important to people's lives.

Commenting too late on my own thread because I  went out after I posted this: To those wondering why someone would "destroy" bitcoin after investing so much in it, I guess destroy was a poor choice of words, but essentially they would control it and could then use it to their own ends and not the democratic ends of the community, this would destroy the true value of bitcoin to society not bitcoin itself. Really what they would do is attempt to extract as much value from their possession as possible up to and including destroying it (by ripping everyone else off)if that turned out to be the most profitable choice available to them.

Aside from the (somewhat) forgivable yen/yuan confusion (they both derive from the same original Chinese character and can both be pretty directly translated to dollar). China is set up to be a huge player both positively and negatively in Bitcoin.   
  
The level of currency controls here coupled with the amount of people who want to get their money the fuck out of this country means there is a huge unrealized demand for bitcoin. A lot of this demand comes from high up officials and connected businesspeople wanting to hide and safeguard their illicit gains. There is a pretty established market for this involving brokers, shell companies, real estate investments, etc. so I think it will take some time, a few years probably, for bitcoin to penetrate here, especially with the language insularity(they say what is popular here is what was popular in the west five years ago) but when it does, I can imagine it will go off like a bomb. 
  
I am also willing to bet money that the Chinese will be the first major government to ban bitcoin outright. Whether that will be a good thing or a bad thing for Bitcoin I don't know. Sometimes governments see the Chinese do something and think "we shouldn't be like them" other times, like in the case of the Great Firewall they see the Chinese getting away with it and start fantasizing about putting the same restrictions on their own people.
