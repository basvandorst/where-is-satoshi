StochRSI could be a primitive example of the method because it applies a formula to something that is already used as indicator. Still a poor example, there are other transformation that transform the indicator "sharper", and then one also has to look at the industry as a whole even though one plans to only trade that one specific market.

The thing with this is one needs to take the indicators only as metrics and apply something on them. Things like RSIs do measure something that's going on with the market but while most traders will take them as signals, it seems to me at least it is more effective to transform them in such a way that "sharpens" that message. The transformed message is itself a probability distribution and one can then watch that with less noise. It's probably questionable whether that is still TA though because there is less of rules and more of signals.

Do you realize that public blockchains can make credit checks far easier than they are with fiat?

Unless they have kids (and care for them). Or have something they care for deeply, the way most people care for middle class life. Freaks that are not butthurt, pretty much. Those are "compatible".
