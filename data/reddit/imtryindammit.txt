Yes... the grammar nazi bot is most annoying.. I saw one that was obsessed with people using “ad hominem” correctly lol

Ugh... such a waste. I gave up Xmas years ago. Best thing I ever did financially.. besides packing a lunch.

My 5 yr old has an iPhone 6s Plus... I had an  etch-a-Sketch ... I started way behind the curve.. lol

Haha! Thanks for the early morning laugh... I feel you.

The sheer brilliance of Reddit never ceases to amaze me. The bots people create look like magic. I come from a time before microwaves and cable tv. I often wonder if other people are in as much awe as I am when they see the tech advances over the last 40-45 years? I was 5 when microwaves came out. It is an amazing time to be alive. Hope I am here to see what can be done in another 45.

It took me 6-8 months to become 1/2 way decent at using my first iPhone... let’s not pretend that he won’t have an advantage.. 
and I didn’t have videos that were constantly teaching me things ... I played with sticks. 
He will be much more comfortable with tech than I am. And much more curios ... I didn’t even want an iPhone... it was a gift. I hated it and I would have missed out on so much. 
My son watches videos on robotics ..

OMG! Thank you! I find this feature to be mind blowing! I know... I’m old... hence my user name ... lol
@_date: 2019-11-09 13:43:39
Same. When I first bought in though... I was obsessed. First big drop cured that.
@_date: 2019-11-19 10:55:37
I was hoping for a spike before Black Friday... sales and discounts for paying with bitcoin.... that’s not what’s happening. 
Another drop... yikes!
@_date: 2019-08-02 11:37:24
How did you purchase it? 
I would like to put about 1/2 of my liquid savings in... but there is a ton of info to sort through on what platform to use to buy it. 
So far I have downloaded 3 apps... don’t know which one to use. 
And did you put your “key” or the passcode to your wallet in a safety deposit box? That was my plan.

I did that in the beginning too. But after the first big drop I experienced... i was cured. I bought at $10,500. Now I don’t want to look. Lol

Well damn.. I was hoping that while I was asleep, China would have been awake and taken us to the moon.

I loved the camera on that phone!
@_date: 2019-09-03 03:20:59
I saw it recommended on a few other threads. I have liked it so far ... I can look and see how much I have. It was simple. I buy stuff online and lots of people ask for payment through it .. they say the fees are cheaper. I haven’t really figured the whole thing out.
@_date: 2019-09-10 00:52:38
Just to check out bitcoin, I bought some using CashApp... how would I get it into a wallet?
@_date: 2019-09-03 03:18:28
I was down $75 last week... it would have been worth that just for the knowledge and entertainment. I’m not risking anything that would break me. It’s a great way to learn.
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:31:48
Well at least the bleeding has stopped. 
When I first bought bitcoin two months ago, I checked the value obsessively. This drop has cured  that... now I’m just holding with my eyes closed. Lol
@_date: 2019-09-04 02:28:32
You should write for CSI: cyber devision or something. That was great! 
I wouldn’t have any idea how to do 1/2 of those things... I love cold case file type stuff. I can only imagine what it will be like in 20 years. Total 24/7 surveillance.
@_date: 2019-09-07 02:55:45
Same thing happened to me last week... so I decided to buy more while the price was low. I was up this morning... now I’m at almost dead  even. If you look at the over all picture for the last year... it is steadily climbing. Try not to check every 10 minutes... I know it’s difficult. I tortured myself for the first week. lol 
Even with the drop today .... I’m much more confident and I check the value way less often.  It will be ok.
@_date: 2019-09-03 02:26:03
I’m in the baby pool with you. lol 
I know very little .. but I watched this sub.. got a CashApp account and bought a little bit. It has been fun to watch it go up and down .. right now, I have made about $10.
@_date: 2019-09-10 12:21:27
I will! Thank you.
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:38:58
Exactly lol 
When it got down to $9,500 I almost dumped my whole pay check... then I saw all other crypto was up and it scared me.. so I froze. Good thing. But I’ve decided to hold what I have. There is a split coming. I didn’t invest more than I’d spend at a casino. So it has been educational and entertaining. Now we wait.
@_date: 2019-09-03 04:06:02
That is a good plan ... but I’m still trying to find out what is high and what is low. It looks pretty volatile.
@_date: 2019-09-18 20:35:07
I came here to ask this. I was going to buy more at the lower price until I noticed... every. single  alt is up. I had to pause a minute.
@_date: 2019-09-03 12:04:09
Well thank you! Not sure what I did to deserve it ... but I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-09-04 02:05:29
Oh I wish I could answer all of your questions. I only use CashApp on my phone. And what you just read in my last comment is the total of all my bitcoin and CashApp knowledge. I just got it last week. I bought two things online using my checking account and then I bought a little bitcoin just to see what happens. I check it a few times a day just to see if I made or lost money. 
I was told that  CashApp is good if you want to use bitcoin to buy things and to invest a little. But if you are going bigger... then you shouldn’t keep it all in CashApp... but I’m not a big fish.. yet. Lol
