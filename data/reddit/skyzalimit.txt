It shouldnt matter what a Private Criminal Corporation thinks or doesnt think about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a Living Breathing Entity that will be around Long after the Federal Reserve is Dead. 
So really ... whocares

Well I got scammed by bitofglory.com who is a coinbase merchant. 
Chargebacks allow Customers to rob businesses. NOChargeBacks allows Businesses to Rob Customers.  They need to impliment an escrow service or something to midigate this problem. 6.6btc was stolen from me and I will never get it back. Great Hey ? Dont get me wrong i love btc. But something should be done to protect future customers.

I say we put our sell orders @ 100k and see how many they buy :)

This is why a Decentralized Exchange is needed.  Then we wont have to worry about poor management.

Ive got the same thing in my shop. About half the size. Im.curious what type of net connections are you using. Ive noticed that im.getting alot of stale shares. Im assuming my.5mbps net connection isnt fast enough. 
And how are they stacked. Do you screw them together or are they just siting like that. I have mine side by side.

Bitcoins Great and everything.. and Ive been involved for 4 years now. But there are alot of other coins that are better. There faster .. more secure.. require less power to secure the network.. like a billionth less the energy needed. 
Bitcoin will soon be the little guy. 
Coins like  will be the future.. you actually have to work for it.. and anyone can mine them with a laptop.

  There is no Tax Law...  Simple.. the IRS Has Zero Say in regular affairs letalone Bitcoin.

BAIL-INs were introduced into the Canadian Federal budget in 2013. 
I cant wait untill they hit and everyone takes whats left and jamms it into Bitcoin and Vericoin
Vericoin is AS good or better then Bitcoin. Its a Proof of Stake coin where you can earn 2.3% Intrest which is better then any bank. With VeriBit I can spend my Vericoin where ever a Bitcoin is accepted and there are twice as many VRC making its true value around .3BTC or more. 
Theyve partnerd with Coinsis to being a VeriCard Visa to the planet which will be awesome whennits released in Nov. 
Get ready for Massive BAIL-Ins on a Global scale . 
If you would like more info feel free to contact me on gliph here.  Gliph.me/8fj 
and visit Vericoinnews.info today ! 
I recommend buying 100$ worth. 
Hundred dollars now will be worth Alot in the future. 
Peace

I also am a Christian who is invested in Bitcoin. And I often wonder the same things. It is getting pretty close to the cashless society but its not being forced upon us and there is really no mark yet.. so I think I will continue to mine and invest untill I look up and see New Jerusalem ascend from the sky. Its a ship btw :)
@_date: 2013-06-10 03:58:50
Why doesnt everyone selling just say they want $5000.00 per BTC and make us all happy. 
@_date: 2013-10-09 23:19:03

@_date: 2013-07-18 15:48:58
dissapointment after dissapointment... ive been waiting 11 months now.. I think ive used up my reserved cache of patients.  So frustrated. I paid 106 BTC for a Lil Single . ive lost so much money waiting for it and by the time it gets here it probaly will take forever just to recoup my initial investment.  and the terahash rate is at 240 or something.. wow . I swear ill never do business with them again. I bet if I orderd from KNC miner that theyd show up before the freakin BFL junk gets here ....DOUBLE FACEPALM
@_date: 2013-06-03 16:47:29

alot of ppl in my town send money to the phillipines through Western Union or RIA . if thwy could transfer Bit coins that would save on the fees . there's potentially a huge market for this. just need to establish a good way to turn BTC into pesos in PH

@_date: 2013-09-20 00:27:43
Never fear BTC Price will adjust to compinsate for losses any day now. If the 5 petahashes they say is coming online in dec actually does. BTC Will hit 400 $ a bit.
