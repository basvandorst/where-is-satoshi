Good news.  The reason Bitcoin growth has bitch slapped that of gold, silver, etc. is due to COMEX.
Go to any gold.silver bug blog and see them moan &amp; whine about those "COMEX gangsters" pulling out the rug from them again...&amp; again &amp;.....you get the story.
ETF denial allows BTC holders to not have to deal with the "battered spouse" victimization above.

Kumbaya regarding this HF situation &amp; BTC is $1500-$2K in a NY minute.
Hopefully it gets sorted soon - with the stock market volatility that seems to be coming up the BTC gain would be insane

Bitcoin doesn't have institutional derivatives tied to it.
Correlations that trading algos account for can't slam Bitcoin if say yen rises or T-Bills go a certain way.  If they could do it in an automated fashion it would be like " what's the point?" 
Bitcoin is a teeny "market" populated mainly by retail or retail+ types.
That's why there is opportunity - just a smidgen of funds go to BTC &amp; it is going to go nuts.  
Vanguard Utilities ETF has a $5 billion dollar higher market cap than Bitcoin!
There are thousands more cases like this - see what I mean?
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:01:19
Here is the link I got the Vanguard infor.
Scoll thru &amp; see the other market caps - this is just Vanguard their are 1000s of etfs/mutual funds.

So in case of HF breadwallet &amp; Samarai are default BU chains ( since they will have longest chain) ?
Could you just wait 6mos or a year to see where it all settles after before making a transaction/selling?

I think ETF being rejected was bad if you figure short term as Friday high to this week.
Medium/Longer term BTC created MASSIVE street cred amongst WallSt. watchers.
ANY other instrument would have been pounded to dust today &amp; probably for weeks after.
Bitcoin just keeps coming with its measly $20 Billion Market cap.  1% of gold holdings come over ( just gold not silver like VIX, Bonds etc) BTC is $5K.
Soooooo little for BTC to get exponential.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:09:37
I meant just gold - not silver or other investment vehicles like VIX bonds etc.

Wait to see if next week's FED rate hike takes place then watch the Yuan.
You'll see how much a store of value it is in real time.

Easily my favorite technical analyst when it comes to BTC.
His youtube channel is epic too.
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:23:24
No bull trap. Ton of election/political/interest rate/ chaos coming next week.
Wall St sorts that expected this ETF denial to be a headshot to Bitcoin are gonna mess their pants when they see the bounce.
BTC is the HoneyBadger of investments &amp; it will garner even more interest because of this as a Safe Haven - that actually....grows too.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:24:39
Sun-Tzu would!
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:45:38
What about in breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:59:13
Tax deferred 401k/Roth IRA = ETF for sure.
With my real investing cash outside above?
BTC from the exchanges/localbitcoins etc.  
Have to be nuts to go ETF purchasing hypothecated Bitcoin if you could just by rel Bitcoin.
ETF is just so corporate/401k types can get access to "Bitcoin"

Despite HF drama, if stock market sheds a few hundred points ( its due ) I see another ATH.
@_date: 2017-03-22 08:33:43
Holy....I just posted same!  Grandparents used to watch when I was little &amp; when I read all this stuff that song pops immediately in my head ( how long has it been like decades!)  Too weird
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:17:41
Watch it bounce back.  Wall St is gonna be like "Huh"!?!
Bitcoin IS the HoneyBadger.
Next week will be awesome - Fed rate hike or not/Dutch elections -
Chaos yo.
Go Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:47:03
I think a lot of people think this would lead to more BTC demand.
Me too &amp; it adds legitimacy.  
It also allows COIN to hypothecate.  They could do a 4 for 1 reverse split if price sinks or the opposite if price rises while keeping their 97K shares they have amassed.
The etf could just be a walled trade vehicle.
I think it will make BTC go up but the idea of having to buy zillions of BTC to back up the share price is unlikely for a loooong time as they could just hypothecate to smaller ownership of BTC they have.
JNUG is doing this now.

Is the BU patch issues normal for deveploment/release or are anti-BU people really laying it on hard for what would be common mistakes that are really just part of the process?
I get the idea that this is UN-common and that's what fuels the disdain for these faulty releases/patches etc.
Benny Hill theme song keeps popping up in my mind when I hear about new exploit ( grandparents used to watch) &amp; wondered if its normal or just those with opposing views giving them a hard time.

Best buy signal ever

Hope it goes thru though as there will be a mighty pop !

Fedor is still best MMA to ever live IMO.
No idea he was coding Bitcoin too!

I am.  I've done it.  Doesn't matter if someone grabs your phone.
They will guess wrong &amp; get locked out - then they will need seed words.
If you think someone will guess your iPhone password correct then guess your bread password correct in no more than I think 4 attempts each.......
You need to start worrying about other events occurring of similar statistical liklihood ( or greater for that matter).
Such As:
Space Aliens invade &amp; they are not nice, they are mean &amp; you remind them of someone that picke on them when they were young aliens.
Asteroid/Meteor landing on your house
Being attacked by rabid bunnies while in park

I can't believe that the Chinese - given their protection of domestic markets in other industries, would ever miss a chance of capitalizing on an edge (china miner concentration) to leverage.
Its like having their rare earth mineral mining monopoly 
with a potential of x100-1000 if bitcoin takes off globally.
Sun Tzu would.

Question -    Can you sell bitcoin on breadwallet app too?
@_date: 2017-04-07 21:04:57
Addicted to Swissguy's videos &amp; accurate calls !
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:56:45
Bitcoin popular amongst saavy migrants.  How can you tell?
The cash checking places in southwest offering Bitcoin - they put it in your wallet then you send to fam - with a fee they buy right off exchange.
You can ATM it instead then send back.
Normal ways of sending money back is nuts price wise.  With BTC the $ even GROWS
Mexico gets a birds eye view so no doubt they will "get it" before others

MY  BICOIN Technical Analyst.
Swissguy on youtube.
Love his channel !!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-04-12 23:29:32
Seriously - All the segwit reasoning etc.  Don't matter unless he says so with his leverage.  He can just keep on hanging out &amp; doubt the resolve of those against him being able to pull off UASF etc.
Maybe not checkmate but he has to like his odds.  
@_date: 2017-04-12 23:41:54
Excellent &amp; realistic article.

Shocked OP "hoshpokharna" hasn't been banned.  Perhaps mods realize he has.....issues.
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:24:23
Oh.....they can &amp; will.  Just as with gold/silver they can trade the iou or paper back and forth without actual receipt.  They do this with bonds &amp; mortgage tranches as well - which are also "paper".
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:31:56
They do this with gold/silver.  It's to allow derivative markets to just trade with each other &amp; never take physical posession of the gold/silver being traded.  They just paper trade back &amp; forth not having to actually have in hand the coin.  Bad news.
