lol my dog has better grammar than you do, get lost
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:52:11
That’s a copy paste from Google translate which is why the grammar sucks. It’s a scam
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:34:04
If it ever gets to 100k, we are going to be seeing 15k swings in a single day.. its going to be insane.

the next 40 million hack will push us to 7k
@_date: 2019-05-06 21:47:11
hopefully they screw up at some point, I told them to mark it down as a loss already but I'll keep an eye on the transactions if/when its moved
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:36:30
is that in like Canadian or Australia $$
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:31:51
so true
@_date: 2019-05-29 17:31:12
I would never do market buy, especially for something with small volume as there are people that try and get away with say putting an ask for $1 on a token that is selling for 10 cents. If someone does a market buy for a large amount, you're going to get screwed on the overall price.

8k already broke

they called someone thinking they were tech support for their Ledger Nano
thought they were talking to Prime XBT
@_date: 2019-05-06 21:26:03


they called "833-440-9444" thinking it was Prime XBT, I'm trying to get the full story but there's missing parts. They remoted them into their computer and they were trying to get help moving funds to another wallet and the scammer moved all funds to their own address, then they proceeded to try and get Google Play gift cards.. the 5k wasn't enough. I just called the number and couldn't even understand them but sounded like they are one of those Microsoft tech support scam centers.

write the private key on paper, frame it and hang it on your front door with a note saying this private key holds 20 bitcoins
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:20:27
it'll be back at 3k in a few weeks
@_date: 2019-05-29 17:48:59
took me a bit to understand it too, but once it clicks its the only way to trade
@_date: 2019-05-06 21:34:22
so its basically a waiting game to see if they move funds to an address that is known to be part of an exchange
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:42:18
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:37:06
