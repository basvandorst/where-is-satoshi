I guess I have an incomplete understanding of trezors and/or bitcoin security in general. I thought you could retrieve/move your coins in the event that your trezor is lost or damaged without another trezor. Also, can you not just use a second trezor to move the coins and also have a new key? What's the best way for me to learn about these things? While I unfortunately don't have the millions in bitcoin that would necessitate the peace of mind of having three trezors, I still feel as if my understanding of the security is limited despite the fact that I'd consider myself more knowledgeable than the avg person with regard to bitcoin (which seems like a problem if we all want mass adoption of this system). Any help would be appreciated.

Bit me.

I would be interested in doing this depending on the details. It only makes sense as a group deal.

The details in your last paragraph and/or the fact that one needs to buy three trezors for proper security seems to preclude the whole idea that getting a trezor would be one of the simplest and most secure ways to store one's coins.

Thanks for the reply. I am in the states. It sounds as if trezor is the way to go right now, but do you think the cost of a trezor is prohibitive to broader scale adoption or that the price is expected to come down? I guess what I'm trying to say is that I still see a hurdle there. Trezor looks pretty awesome, but getting new users of bitcoin (particularly those in third world countries or low income) to buy into it at the current rate doesn't seem to facilitate the switch for all those people, and I got the impression that this was a major element in the future of bitcoin utility (as mentioned by Andreas). For example, banks right now will basically pay you a hundred or so bucks to "securely store" your money with them in a new checking account. Bitcoin is supposed to make finance available to a large population of those who can't trust their banking system or don't have access to it, and cost barriers for usage seems to work against that goal.

Why would most people need three trezors?

Tip: If you put the title of the article into a google search, the resulting article link does not have a pay wall. It also works with NYTimes and similar pay wall sites.

How long does it take between redemptions? Is there a specific delay built in? I had accumulated 2000pts and it only allowed me to redeem the first 1000. Now, nothing happens when I try to redeem the second.

I ordered Pappy mid september. Never got the package, and they only responded once to my inquiries about what may have happened, then proceeded to ignore me. Their customer service is shitty in my experience so beware. You have no recourse if something goes wrong.

I shall pay this tip forward
