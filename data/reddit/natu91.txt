@_date: 2018-09-09 19:01:41
I meant the USA government ��
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:11:14
Thanks for your input! 
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:55:39
Hm ��, thanks for replying! 
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:13:35
Of course yes, but not only that 
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:54:12
I see....��
@_date: 2018-09-22 13:29:39
Of course the wouldn't be secret money printing and devaluation anymore, that I understand 
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:58:16
Don't the powerful/rich still have power over you if you are not part of the early crypto movement, but the powerfull are? 
@_date: 2018-09-22 13:28:44
Would crypto make the world better? Or would it give people like trump even more power, without even the need to be president.....? 
@_date: 2018-09-28 09:41:09
Check out request network for the rest 
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:54:32
I see....��
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:03:12
Motivated by government forces
@_date: 2018-09-08 16:03:32
Facebook also blocks ads about crypto. And guess where that is coming from
@_date: 2019-03-12 21:27:23
Well, then people will start "to smuggle in" krypto btc or eth into the country, oh yeah right, way too easy. Pretty sure some krypto whale is investing hard with his krypto in farm land. 
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:16:48
The rich will have even more control over everything
@_date: 2019-03-22 06:16:19
So, what should people choose, the "green" bitcoin or the orange?
Bch is faster, right? 
@_date: 2018-10-17 19:14:13
Even when 10000 people generate each 100000 wallets everyday?
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:41:35
well, isn't the question, what is done with those taxes? Is it getting you free heealth care, free minimum monthly salary without any condition, making sre, nobody dies because of poverty?
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:27:07
Where's the "mewn sewn boiz" guy? 
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:39:17
well, then he should provide enough support, so in that factory, those workers will get hopefully as much as the people get, were theire products are sold to...?
@_date: 2018-10-08 17:09:12
A company to believe in ��������
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:58:22
As long as there are people, there is value. Please try to understand that :) 
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:10:35
Really like the "mewn sewn boiz" 
@_date: 2018-10-04 13:27:20
Well, the background picture is a wallpaper. Forest + sun.
I might have found it online.... 
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:46:49
What about a 51 % attack by a country being able to control over 50 % of computers worldwide...? 
@_date: 2019-12-11 17:46:06
Don't pre judge too much and see for yourself how Greece is, or you will miss out ;)
@_date: 2019-02-19 10:30:56
... Whaaat xD? 
@_date: 2019-02-27 10:53:54
Lol, what xD
@_date: 2019-12-10 06:51:05
Habe you even been to Greece ever?
@_date: 2019-04-13 10:21:54
Wasabi is not Chinese at all man, it's Japanese
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:07:20
Oh good choice. Ethereum was used, not btc, did anybody see?
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:30:40
Ouuuu I love this pigeon 
@_date: 2018-11-13 05:43:38
Lol, then 50 $ ethereum would be 5000 $
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:33:19
Oh niiice.
Stay self confident &amp; clear minded! 
@_date: 2018-11-04 19:34:44
And no ethereum, u gotta be kidding me xD
@_date: 2018-11-09 07:15:17
The style u are writing your title is like the cheap newspaper or clickbait. Are you aware, that there now are dozens of people who really believe that s. n. is the us government?
There is nothing near proof.
Feel more responsible in what and how you post something. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:06:35
Using which exchange? 
@_date: 2018-11-18 07:18:44
Please read the ethereum white paper, or watch a YouTube video! 
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:58:56
Mid October maybe. Ask Trump
@_date: 2019-05-18 04:56:32
And even much more like ethereum xD
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:38:43
Please explain
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:40:24
Rising too fast, there will be a sell off
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:35:10
but not on coinbase xD. Just imagine those fees :(
@_date: 2019-05-10 13:48:07
HAAHAHAHAHA, Maybe he is pro Bitcoin after all. No better ad for crpytos.
@_date: 2018-12-23 10:14:14
And ETH are the scientist atheists
@_date: 2018-12-06 11:41:56
But regarding using crypto as payment asset, there are no taxes. Which makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:47:04
Same in Germany, can anybody confirm? 
@_date: 2019-05-04 07:55:17
So what made you decide not to invest 50 % btc and 50 % bch
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:57:26
So bch in other words sacrafices Security for a faster network?
Of course, nothing though would withstand a 51% attack.
