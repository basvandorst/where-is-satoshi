What a poor article.
A 10 year old can give a better explanation of the market situation.
You cant scream "scam" and point how the market cap shrunk in a bearmarket. It fudgin happens in all markets.
Its a complex ecosystem.
This article is retarded at best

The bart moves currently happening in btc move the price on average for 200 points and the volume is usually about 200 million in like 10 min

Well then brace yourself because we need to close above 3260 within the next 2-3 hours and the buy ins should come to push us through all the short positions at this level and then we might have atleast a new short term trend reversal

Nice read i wasnt aware of all the hacks that happen back then

Its true, brokers are trading paper bitcoins. But no manipulation there. the futures that were promised to be traded and thus create liquidity is non existant though
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:05:38
If the bull flag holds for a while.. Maybe, but so far most of the rallies failed. This one looks more promising ill give you that but dont get your hopes up yet
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:16:06
Your friend is definitely a pro. Thats how good traders do it
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:05:38
Ok whatever 
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:40:29
Haha its funny because you will end up starving if you stay a bull in this bear market 
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:11:16
"fall to negative price"
Not much of an experts

Thats assuming everyone here can buy 1 btc. Probably like 20% at best can afford such buy. I guess whales can compensate
