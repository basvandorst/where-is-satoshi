you can look at the address in the blockchain however all you are going to come up with is a rough estimate (often off by 30% -40% even when checking my own address there).

The Hester street fair (weekends in the warm months - till Oct) most venders now accept bitcoins on Sundays.

Nice. Didn't realize Josh had had the exact same experience as me. Got ripped off recently (Dragon-miner.com  DON'T FALL FOR IT, after much digging found out its actually run by a wanted criminal) and went looking for chip suppliers and a company to assemble miners for me. Don't think I'll expand into a full time business, just wanted to build enough so that when I sell them I make up for what I lost on the scam. (Just having five 1.4 THS ASICS put together and plan on selling 4 of them).

This, this makes me giggle. The idea of a TRAILING average having predictive power, please. 
"The age at which most men are hit buy cars will predict when you will die!" HAHAHA

And to be honest those are also useless.

It can you could mine .0001 bitcoins in less than a year, possibly.

Just an FYI but they also flag ANYTHING they tag as related to Bitcoin as "Fraudulent". 
I'd suggest getting a card from a different bank, the people that took that one over 15 years ago seem to be as sleazy as they come with their sales tactics.

No, actually it has absolutely no relationship like that. Its more of, the water thrown from the plane landed on a tree twice last week, so it will this week. (even though we are flying over the ocean this week).
There is no physical, direct or even often rational relationship between historical pricing and future pricing. 
If you could predict any traded item with 80% accuracy  then you would be too wealthy to bother with any of this within two months. 
The best price predictive models (that take more computing power than 100 times the entire current hashing rate for all cryptos combined by the way) is good for 51.44% and took economists, CS geniuses and observational traders over 70 years to develop.

Well I'll sign the petition but quite frankly I think resources are better expended informing the public how ridiculous and onerous the provisions of the proposal are.
