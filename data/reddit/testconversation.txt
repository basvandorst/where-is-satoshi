Send him a link to blockchain.info showing that you have already deposited money in that address. :-) I assume someone fell for it, claim that it was you that sent it and show proof.

Lets say you purchase some bitcoins and send them to an address called Address A. The seller now knows Address A is your address and he wishes to watch your spending, or stalk you in some way.
You decide to spend money at Expedia and they give you an address to send money to. You send them coins and the change goes to Address B. Stalker sees you split all of your coins between Address B and Address Expedia. Since he doesn't know which address is which, he will have difficulty determining which address to follow. He basically comes to a fork in the road and will have trouble determining which way to go. He may have to guess. If you used only one address, then he would easily be able to follow the coins until they are spent as they continually go back to the same address.
edit: grammar.

The fact that they are unclaimed does not mean they belong to the government.

Of course it is less then cash, all digital solutions will be less then cash and that is unavoidable. The difference is cash can be stolen even when it is buried in the desert, all it takes is a printing press. The benefits, from a libertarian perspective, greatly outweigh the cons. Plus you can always wash them, this will get easier and easier as time goes by.

Why would libertarians be anti bitcoin. We prefer privacy and this is far more private the credit cards.

Yes, because all of silk roads customers were minors. /s
The point you are missing, however, is this: Regardless of how certain we are of his guilt, in this country you are innocent until proven guilty. Until he got his day in court those bitcoins were legitimately earned.
