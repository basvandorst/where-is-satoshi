I suppose it depends on the nature of the purchase. I might have to convert some of my coins to USD if I want to buy a $3,000 TV, but those types of purchases are few and far between. For me anyway. The bulk of my weekly purchases (from Amazon, sorry Overstock!) are between $20 and $200, and for those types of purchases I'm going to use cash/credit.
You are right that some people will want the new stereo system more so than Bitcoins, and they will buy that stereo with Bitcoins, but I think smaller purchases are the real bread and butter for an online business, and people may not be in any rush to make small purchases with Bitcoins.
I'm really excited about Overstock accepting Bitcoin, and I may shop there more often for purely ideological reasons, but I'll still be making the bulk of my purchases using cash/credit. I already blew through a lot of Bitcoins when they were around the $75 mark, and I don't want to make that mistake again.

I've had good experiences *buying* Bitcoins on localbitcoins.com. I suppose if the person you want to sell to is reputable you should be okay. I've used Western Union each time, which means as a seller you could pick up cold hard cash pretty quickly, without much risk.
Edit: I don't use it much anymore. It's gotten pretty easy to buy Bitcoins with a credit card. Less of a hassle that way.

The toolbar is installed on millions of browsers, which makes it really, really unlikely that only "webmasters and SEO/SEM types" are using it. Also, the toolbar isn't the only tool Alexa uses to collect data.
Regardless, I have yet to see a single accurate way to measure site traffic/reach, and that includes Compete, Quantcast, comScore, and even Google Analytics. You'll get widely different numbers from all of those companies, and none of them match up with raw data mined from access logs.
However, people have a need to monitor web statistics, so there's no point in saying, "Well, analytic services suck, so just ignore them." If these inaccurate services are our only option, then we have no choice but to use them, and there's no harm in using them to get a rough measure of traffic/reach.

I'm not sure where you're going with this. People are hoarding Bitcoins. Some people aren't. Some people are cashing out because they think the price is going down. Some are cashing out because they need to pay their rent. Some are cashing out to take their purchasing to another exchange.
The point is, if Overstock accepts Bitcoins, I'm still going to pay for purchases with a credit card, instead of wasting my coins.

There's a difference between passionate and being biased. More power to you if you feel passionate about Bitcoin. No one is going to find fault in that.
However when you argue with bias, you are arguing while [wearing blinders]( and you're doing Bitcoin more harm than good. When proving your point of view means first discrediting 30 years of experience, a PhD, a degree from MIT, and a Nobel prize, then you are making the Bitcoin community look like a gaggle of idiots.

I suppose it depends on your goals. Everyone lets large sums of their money flow through closed source apps. Whether it's your bank website, bank app, Quicken, Mint, or even ATMs. When your goal is managing your money, then there's nothing wrong with close sourced wallets.
However when your goals are more aligned with the open and free nature of Bitcoin, then I can understand not wanting to give validation to close sourced apps.

Well, cash is really a non issue here, and isn't even a player in the point OP is trying to make. Cash for Bitcoins is the only simple means of getting them. Assuming there's a dealer somewhere in your area.
Buying Bitcoins is difficult because of the irreversible nature of Bitcoins, and safeguards put in place to protect you. I mean, it would be great to buy btc with a credit card, but that's impossible because credit card transactions can be reversed, and btc transactions cannot. This is the reason exchanges prefer wire transfers, because they match Bitcoin's irreversibility.
This is actually a flaw in Bitcoins, not in fiat currency.
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:09:45
This is why I'm investing in cryptocurrencies on behalf of some friends and family without them knowing. They won't care what a bitcoin is when in 10 years I hand them a piece of paper worth $100k.

We could also use something along the lines of [PCI compliance]( and deposits backed by insurance. Not unlike FDIC.
So far I'm not a fan of Coinbase.

Someone needs to figure out a way to speed up the process without charging huge fees.

You can get your money back just fine if you're not an idiot. Send the prince a check, and you can cancel the check. Pay the prince with a credit card, and you can get your money back. Pay the prince using Paypal, and you can get your money back.
There is no way to get your Bitcoins back after a transaction under any circumstances. There's no way to reclaim your coins if you deleted your wallet. If I forget my checking account number, I can walk down to the bank and get my money after proving who I am.
These systems are slow for a reason.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:50:53


That is the problem OP is describing though, even if it's the only problem.
Saying it's trivially easy to prove a transaction was made is a pointless statement. Governments and banks aren't even sure yet if Bitcoin is legal. Do you honestly expect credit card companies to start playing detective when you sold Bitcoins to someone, and they reversed the charge? You're kind of faulting the credit card company for not dealing with a technology that may not even be legal.
If you think the financial system is slow now, imagine how slow it would be if credit card companies jumped on every bandwagon that came along.
@_date: 2013-12-30 11:04:49
We've been accepting Bitcoins at Motherless for a good 6 months now, and have been allowing Bitcoin cash outs for nearly as long. Granted, we are a free site, and what you're buying is on par with Reddit gold, but people have been using them. Bitcoins have been very popular as a cash out option.
We think Bitcoins are a wonderful option for adult purchases, where people prefer anonymity. You no longer have to worry about your wife questioning weird charges she found on the credit card bill.
Side note: We'd like to accept other coins too, if we can find a reputable payment processor. Bitpay seems determined to never process anything except Bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-12-29 23:38:10


The legalities of it haven't been sussed out yet. There's a reason the CEO of Overstock said he needs to wait until officially accepting bitcoins. No one is sure what legal issues may be involved. This is a simple issue, and there's no reason for you to be getting heated over it, and yelling FUD. Especially towards me.


Duh, yes he is. Credit is a form of fiat currency, which is the subject of OPs post. Do some research before you argue credit is not a fiat currency.


It is your own. Keep it as cash, and you can do whatever you want with it. Deposit it into a checking account, and you are agreeing to the rules set by the bank.


Yes you are. You said it's easy for the credit card companies to track Bitcoin transactions. They *don't* already do that, and it would slow down the system if you actually expect them to follow up on every new technology that comes and goes. The president of a bank doesn't just send out a memo saying, "Hey, we investigate Bitcoin transactions now! Everyone learn what a block chain is so you can help customers get their money back!" There are systems that must be put in place first, and it's too early to say if the effort is worth it.
This may come as a surprise to some here, but Bitcoin is not the first digital currency to come along. There's a digital currency graveyard out there. If banks invested time and effort to handle situations surrounding every currency that came and went, it would significantly slow things down. They will handle Bitcoin transactions when and if the technology has proven itself.
So no, it's not easy for them to simply look at a transaction, and refund your money if you got burned.
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:12:39
I was thinking about that, but didn't want to create a post to ask. Specifically I was wondering how many days it take before a transfer is irreversible.

In this case you create the wallet yourself [using your own home computer and printer]( is only selling wallet "accessories", i.e. little tamper proof stickers to seal your home printed wallet, and vinyl sleeves.
The key to understanding paper wallets, is knowing the wallet software running on your PC has nothing but a bunch of public and private key pairs and a bit of meta data stored inside of it. Those key pairs are all you need to receive and send coins, because your actual coins exist in the block chain, not in your wallet. The private key is used to "claim" those coins in block chain.
These paper wallets also have a public and private key written on them, which, once again, is all you need to send and receive coins.
It's a bit like the combination for a school locker. The combination could be stored in a file on your computer, or written down on a piece of paper. In the same way your bitcoin private keys could be stored in a wallet.dat file on your computer, or written on a piece of paper.
