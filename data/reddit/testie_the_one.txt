But we can't be sure The Great Ravi hasn't published a million different hashes for a million videos of different outcomes in order to prove his point... So unless he can prove that was his only prediction it does not help him or us in this use case. 
It does show a lot of hard work ;)

I assume you are correct for a time traveler with a specific event and timestamp to prove. But I think that the Great Ravi that 'sees' the future would be less specific in timestamps, don't you think?

I got it from a friend. I think he 3D-printed it himself.. I'll check!

In the [contract]( both parties agree (in clause 1.K) to $50 million in damages purely for the breach of 'exclusivity' on part of Mt Gox.. So it does not seem that weird!
