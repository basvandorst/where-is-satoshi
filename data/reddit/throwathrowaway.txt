Your lack of logic astounds me.  There's no automatic mechanism for the bid price to adjust to the new asking price (in fact, the bid price and the ask price is never the same, since this would cause a transaction to execute, forcing a gap between the bid and the ask price).
If the very next transaction after your huge buy is a sell, then the "last price" would be at the highest bid (immediately dropping from your last purchase price).
And using your logic (that the bid will somehow automatically adjust to the ask), it's just as likely that it would happen the other way around (that the ask would somehow automatically adjust to the bid).
There's nothing automatic about this, except where people have foolish or gutsy bots.
Your "that is simple logic" statement has no basis in fact, and you failed to support it.  Just watch what happens sometime in the real world, and you'll see how wrong you are.
There's no way to "buy your way to a more valuable asset".

Yeah, but guys like Krugman can preach about Bitcoin's impending demise for decades.  "it will fail.  Just because it hasn't failed *yet* doesn't mean it won't fail."
And someday, perhaps 2000 years from now, perhaps 10,000 years from now, he'll probably be right.  I suspect *he* will fail before Bitcoin does.

I think the general idea of wallet software is that once a private key is known, you shouldn't "forget" it, because that risks losing money.  The cost of carrying around an extra private key is so small (like 32 bytes) that deleting it is not worth the risk.
I believe this is a good policy.  Allowing non-power users to delete keys seems risky.  Power users can always dump all keys and pick through them.

No worries.  Once the downtrend goes below zero, and people are paying me to take their bitcoins, I'm going to load up.

Do you mean this comment:  


Because this has 122 upvotes at the present time, so apparently over 100 people gave a fuck.
Maybe Walmart doesn't give a fuck, but somebody, somewhere does.

Why don't you simply create a new wallet and pay all Bitcoins to the new address, and discard the existing wallet file?
The concept of storing any previously known private key that there's *a chance* that the user might receive coins to makes a lot of sense for wallet software writers.  Allowing a non-power user to delete keys seems risky.  If you are a power user, then dumping all keys, and simply deleting the one that you don't want from the list, and then re-importing the rest should take less than about 20 minutes of file manipulation and scripting.

This is good folklore, but not entirely correct.  You can look at the pages on archive.org and see that they never traded cards online.

Monetary policy in an all-bitcoin world is different, and a challenge, but not impossible.
As a major government, the first thing you should do is acquire a bunch of bitcoins - perhaps by seizing them from online drug markets.  Also, allow taxes to be paid in bitcoins.
Then use the stash as your control mechanism.  As a government, you always have an inflow of bitcoins from taxes and seizures.  Your outflow of bitcoins (as compared to your inflow) is your monetary policy.

"news anchor shares his bitcoins with the world only to have a good guy rescue him and move them from harms way, and promise to send them back when safety can be assured" isn't quite as sensational of a headline.

BitPay does one thing, and does it well.
Coinbase is trying to do multiple things, and is consistently having growing pains.
When I had to choose between the two for business, I thought the obvious choice was Bitpay (many months ago).
However, I think it's imperative that there be multiple businesses competing in this field.  One survivor (bitpay) would be a bad thing for Bitcoin.

I interpret your question to mean, "if you mine on a PC, does it use more electricity than normal PC use."  (obviously, if it's a dedicated mining machine, it uses electricity.)  The answer to this question is yes. The harder your PC works, the more electricity it uses.
Of course, you could mine by hand.  And then you would only need a pencil and paper and sunlight.

This is silly logic, and flat out wrong.  
If you buy at market, you "buy the price up", as you are accepting other people's asking price.  But the asset is only worth what you can sell it for (which is the bid price).  So you don't drive the bid price up, only the asking price.  
If you immediately sold, you would lose money, as your bitcoins would be sold at the highest bid price.
By "buying up" the price, you are increasing the bid-ask spread.

For tax purposes, you may want to be clear that you are conveying this gift to him now, and not 18 years from now.  
Just a simple document might do.
There are currently limits (in the US) as to size of gifts before they become taxable income.  $300 now, vs. maybe a lot more in 18 years.... it makes a difference!

I am hesitant to answer, because you are acting like a total douche to everyone that tries to help.  But ok, here goes... act like a douche to me too....
rename your wallet file (back it up), and then create a new wallet from scratch.  Then import all the addresses that you DO want to keep.

I would like to use this, and use it for a really nice juicy tip to someone (for promotional value of Bitcoin, and this service, plus for promotional value of the person I'd like to show support for).
Can you help me feel better about your trustworthiness?  Like, can you help me fell better about trusting you with a large sum of money (several hundred bucks) to make the tip?

There are several ways. 
1. Colored coins:  using tiny amounts of Bitcoins to represent other assets.  A particular Satoshi can represent 100 shares of Apple stock.
2.  Merged Mining:  Namecoin uses the power of the Bitcoin network to solidify its blockchain, with merged mining.  When you solve a bitcoin block, you can be solving a namecoin block at the same time.
3.  Inserting data into transactions.  Services like proofofexistence.com burns bitcoins to document the existence of documents.

The issue that I was bringing up wasn't capital gains.
Here's a hypothetical example.  Say it's worth $30,000 in 18 years.  If he gifts it now (at $300), the kid has $29,700 in capital gains at age 18.
If he gifts it in 18 years, he has exceeded the maximum annual gift limit (which, [in 2013 is $14,000]( meaning that the gift is subject to tax of up to 40%.
It's a concern that OP (should consider.

So then the question would be - why do you think Multibit will (re-)use an address, simply because you have it in your wallet?

I think it'd be a huge mistake for merchants to return "in kind", while there's such volatility.  All you are doing is inviting a huge amounts of returns and order cancellations.
Example with round number:  I pay 1 BTC for some electronics, when Bitcoin is $650.  Bitcoin jumps to $1300.  I now see that I can return the TV, get my 1 BTC back, and buy it again for .5 BTC.  Merchant ends up with half as many BTC, and a huge return nightmare.
Once volatility gets a little more normal (and has a long history of being normal) this won't be such an issue.
