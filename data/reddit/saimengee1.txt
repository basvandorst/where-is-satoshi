Everybody needs to think like you and bitcoins comes what it should be. The new world store of value as a reference to everything. 10% sounds good. I think I will do the same.

I know most of you guys think about selling but it's not very clever to sell now. If you believe in Blockchain, you know it will not go much lower... Hodl

Your right. As long as people don't get hurt they don't switch technology even if it's better. Does people get hurt if their "money" is infaltioning like in Venezuela, Argentinia, Turkey etc.?

yes it is the currency of the internet but in my view it´s more than than that. it could give back to power to the people. 
but in this case i want to educate people who are new and most new people think btc is anonymous and "just a currency to pay daily stuff". in my view it is now more used as a store of value and speculation than to pay daily stuff. pay daily stuff will hopefully be main usecase in 10years !?
I never said it´s not a currency

i noticed most people how know less about bitcoin think it is to pay your daily stuff (products). but i think it´s not the main advantage in this stage. how would you change the sentence?
