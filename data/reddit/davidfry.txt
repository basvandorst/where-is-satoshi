PressureNet is an awesome idea. I've been using it on my phone for a few months. Particularly during hurricane season, its a great app for watching storms. As much as I like bitcoin, this is a small audience, so promoting your app to people who like bitcoin doesn't get the kind of visibility you need.
I might suggest that you could focus on a few other areas instead. Social media is one way, and your Twitter integration is pretty good but could be improved. I'd rather see the pressure and location in the post, and have the link go to a pressurenet.io page showing my update on the map, rather than directing people to the play store. If you make the tweet something that is more personal to your users, people will use them more often. Facebook integration would be great too.
The other suggestion is that you should try promoting this to people when they are most interested in weather which happens mostly during severe weather.  So when you see a tropical depression heading to Hawaii (i.e. right now), that's a good time to start some Facebook ads promoting PressureNet to Android users in Hawaii.
I was wishing we had more folks using your app during the last hurricane. There was someone on the Big Island and a few on Oahu, but with more people, it would be easier to know when the winds are likely to pick up.
And yes, all the folks here saying that people will just use emulators to crap up your data if they can make a nickel at it are right. It's much the same as why survey research companies don't pay people for answers because it leads to a lot of bad data.

It's relevant whether this is said on the front porch or in the master bathroom.

I think trolls come after any group based on how strongly a community holds a set of beliefs, and how divergent those beliefs are from the mainstream view. The more fervently we defend our version of the truth, the easier it is to piss us off. If trolls truly hated bitcoin, they'd just be opponents. The power of trolls is that they don't care even a little so they can take any side to the argument at any time. They can troll bitcoin forums, get bored and go mess with the vegans or the scientologists.

Just from an SEO perspective, if they had gone with Free Market, no one would ever be able to find them amid the 6 million other pages already using the term. I'm not in their target  market and won't be a customer, but I tend to think that anyone looking to buy narcotics on the internet isn't likely to be scared by the name.

Too bad is dead. We could have tipped them.

I'm currently at the 5 week mark. I send them emails every three days in Heading 1/ALL CAPS/Red text just to make it extra obvious that I'm really pissed about the whole situation.

That would work better with Amazon, MGo or any of the on demand systems which actually license movies to sell for short term streaming rental.

Hope you don't need to return your item, because you'll seriously be screwed.
