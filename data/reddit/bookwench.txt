Well, there's the customer base gain, the free attention and advertising, and - if the tool you develop is nice enough - your company could easily a) patent it or b) sell it to other companies interested in doing the same thing and make a profit on it. They might not be in the banking buisness, but if you're in this for one reason there's no reason not to make cash off a secondary revenue stream.

Don't set the price in bitcoins. Bitcoin is a transactional currency - set the price in dollars, accept payment and returns in units of measurement defined by dollars, but processed as bitcoins. 
That way the current market fluctuations of the bitcoin price won't matter, only the dollar fluctuation. 
Or whatever stable currency you want - pounds sterling, whatever has the least alteration on the world market. That's the nice thing about bitcoins; you can use them against pretty much any currency. Consider them as a sort of middleman, a conversionary currency. Eventually they'll stabilize but there's no need to make your company be the one to solve that problem right now. Use them, but set your prices in whatever currency your clients use as a baseline for defining value.

Hate to say this, but that's the customer's problem, not yours. You advertised as $1000. You were pain in money and paid them back the same money. The numbers used in the transaction don't matter - they bought using dollars as a baseline, they get dollars back as a baseline. 
Unless your company is willing to invest in completely altering the world market to stabilize bitcoin, you need to be practical here. Bitcoin is a fluctuating *transactional* currency. It's not a standardized unit of value. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:39:39
So lag's the real problem? Make sure your transactions are instant, and there's no lag. Develop a secure system, own it, sell that system to other retailers. But don't try and use "one bitcoin" as a standardized unit of value. That way lies madness. 
I'd set up some secure servers, get your company a customer bitcoin wallet, and an automated program that generates a new wallet number every time you make a transaction. Then you use a standard bitcoin value of the day from a major website - like money exchangers do - have the customer have their wallet present, on their phone - and do your transactions right there. You'd need a high speed internet connection for validation, but transactions shouldn't take more than a minute or so. Make sure the value of the day is in big red numbers, live updated, so people can't bitch they didn't know what they were getting into. 
Either that or set up a custom app your customers will need to use on their phone to process bitcoin payments. They input their wallet address, you pay to the address in the app, the app pays to their wallet. They see the transaction in both the cash medium you chose for your company (big numbers) and bitcoin value (small numbers). 
Your complaint about bitcoin not being a standardized value won't go away, I'm sure, but if you use some basic psychology, your customer complaints will be far fewer.

The problem with a lot of the surveys is that you're looking at a biased selection pool. People who know about bitcoin enough to have an opinion, people who use bitcoin casually, people who participate in the groups about bitcoin, people who mine bitcoin or are involved in bitcoin as a service for others -  those are related but possibly very different groups of people.

I like google. Generally speaking I respect and trust them as a company. They're pretty damn good at security, too. 
It's like... I have dollars, and when I go overseas I also have pounds sterling and euro and other sorts of currency. I don't get rid of all my dollars just because I also have some euro, or yen, right? I keep some of each and use them situationally. 
So I'd buy google coin and keep my bitcoin and my dogecoin. No skin off my nose either way.

Do you honestly think there's nothing to be gained from spending your life with another human being (or two or three), with knowing someone that deeply? 
Marriage isn't about fucking someone every day, or money, or even raising kids. It's about you and this other person working together towards goals. If those goals are world domination or a farm of your own or curing cancer or having and raising kids or traveling or art or whatever - marriage is about you two together against all the challenges of life, until one of you keels over because we all keel over in the end. 
Marriage is about picking your team partner, someone you think is gonna be a solid thing to lean against when you get tired, and who you're ok with being a solid thing for when they get tired.  
Everyone gets tired sometimes. It's easier if you've got a couple folks around who aren't tired at the same time as you, so you can be strong in shifts instead of all the time alone.

*insert baffled look* 
Um.... If I had a wife, my husband would be really happy, I guess? Are you saying you're some sort of sexy successful man-beast and I should be desiring to have your little babies or something? Because of how alpha you are? You're not a very observant alpha, if so. You're kinda the slow alpha, right? The one the other alphas pat on the head and go, yeah, sure kid, you're a badass.   
Dude... like, seriously. You're the stereotype who makes my previous statements sound way more accurate than they are.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:56:04
*rolls eyes*
Oh please. 
I'd say "no matter how hard you want the guys to treat you like one of the guys they never will" but this is the internet, unless you voluntarily out yourself as a woman, they'll definitely assume you're a guy and treat you like a guy, which is to say, like a human being in their eyes instead of a walking stereotype. It's a huge benefit of the internet.  
But throwing in your lot with them, saying it's ok and their jokes about other women are funny, that's - you get that you don't have to have their approval, right? You don't have to be the Cool Girl who props them up when they say stupid shit about gender? You can disagree with guys about how they act, and it's ok, right? 
Because guys are just as stuck in the world we live in as we are. They're just stuck in a different place in this world, someplace that I'm not sure is really better, but sure as shit has more inherited social power. And everyone stuck in this world, in this structure, everyone has shit to learn. Guys have plenty of shit to learn about how to be proper human beings even when they're talking to humans with different genitals from them. 
So do women, but the context is a bit different. When you see a shy kid you don't tell them to be nicer to others and less of a bully, and when you see a bully you don't tell them to be more assertive. People coming from different places need different methods of support.  
Women and men frequently (insert note about statistics here) come from different social backgrounds and, because of those backgrounds, need different support structures to get where we need them to be for society to work equitably. Men, in a lot of cases, need to have their hands smacked so they stop grabbing what they aren't supposed to grab. Women need to be told to get up there and grab something, anything, seriously stop expecting other people to grab things for you.  
Some women need to be told to stop pretending to be men. Just because men do it that way doesn't mean it's a good idea. 
In the end, good ethical behaviour *is* gender neutral, which is what we're trying to reach for. It's just that to get there, you have to look at why it's not gender neutral right now.

It's not this one post. It's that this one post is part of a constant stream of jokes women see on reddit literally every day - and I do mean literally in the literal sense of the word. 
If you can find me a day in the past year - hell, past three years, let's up the game - where there wasn't a joke made about the "lol dumb wominz" on the all-thread, I'll fucking stop eating cheese for a year. Seriously, I'll go cold turkey on cheese. For a year. (Milk and yogurt are still fair game but I'll even skip those stupid Parmesan sprinkles.) 
Rules: it has to be a full 24 hours period, and all subreddits are included. Yeah, I'll give you easy mode and say you can skip redpill, because that's kind of their reason for existing. But if you can find a single 24 hour period where not one post exists dissing non-specific women as being dumb about something - I'll stop eating cheese. For a year. 
(I ate more than a pound of cheese last week alone. This is a significant thing for me to bet on. Cheese is the delicious ambrosia of the gods. Beecher's cheddar, Herbed Parm, goat's cheese in fresh crunchy lettuce, fresh ricotta with lemon... There's never a bad time of day for cheese.) 
You won't find it. Because posts where a guy has had a specific negative interaction with a specific woman are nearly always annonamized and generalized into applying to all women. "My girlfriend cheated, all women are cheaters." "The hot girl won't date me but she dated the rich guy, all women are gold diggers." 
Because "women" in most men's eyes, as imagined, are specifically "Women who are interesting to me, ie, sexy women." If you're not a sexy woman, you simply don't exist as a female human on the internet unless you can be made fun of for some other reason - like age or your absolute lack of sexual appeal.  
Betcha the reverse isn't true, though. There's probably plenty of 24 hour periods in the past couple years where absolutely nobody made fun of guys as a whole for being stupid or incompetent.

Why isn't Scumbag Steve about all men? Because mostly, it's men posting Scumbag Steve, and he's treated as having violated the bro code.
I googled meme. For giggles. 
Those are the pics. 
Where are the women? 
There's a million memes for men: men are funny, stupid, clever, think they're clever but not really, aggressive, bashful, sweet, lucky, unlucky, charming, sad, isolated, whatever. 
I'm actually mostly really pleasantly surprised. I mean, the first female in the pic list is a woman who is obviously being made fun of for being unattractive while acting attractive. The second has no text. The third - finally, over a page down - is the first time a woman shows up on the page with a voice and sex not involved, but the fact she shows up at *all* in the top 3 women before something worse is kind of a happy feeling. 
So why is Scumbag Steve not the same thing? Because Scumbag Steve is one of a *million* male memes. Because on the internet, you can have any range of expressions, any persona you want... as long as you're a guy, or pretending to be one.

Huh - it didn't seem like a stretch to me, but you might be right.

Hi, and welcome to (x)! We have some exciting news about new payment options that we'd like to share. 
As of (date), we're happy to say we'll be accepting Bitcoins using the (I'm assuming Mt Gox) standard conversion rate. So if you know what Bitcoins are, you can use them here. (Insert short discussion on how the payment works, a QR code link, how you'll be sending or printing a receipt, etc; all specific to your standard operating procedure for Bitcoins in your store, so I can't write this up without more info) 
If you don't know what Bitcoins are, keep reading! 
**The Basics About Bitcoins:** 
* Bitcoins are a new currency developed in 2009 by a mathematician. They're not owned or managed by any one country - they're owned by the people who use them, like a union, or a company owned by its employees. While there are people who sell physical Bitcoins, mostly, they exist online, as a digital currency. 
**How Bitcoins Are Created:** 
* Bitcoins are created when people tell their computers solve a specific mathematical equation. This is called "Bitcoin Mining", anyone can do it, and it's the original way to get Bitcoins. It takes a long time, and a lot of computers, to solve this equation. All the computers solving this equation talk to each other, and let each other know when they create a Bitcoin. 
* Eventually, the equation will reach its end, and all the Bitcoins will have been created. It's expected that there will be 21 Million Bitcoins then. After that, no more Bitcoins will be created, and the ones that do exist will end up being split into decimal places. This keeps Bitcoins from experiencing too much inflation. 
**How People Use Bitcoins:** 
* Everyone who owns a Bitcoin Wallet (and there are different brand names of wallets, which all perform the same basic functions) can create an address, like an e-mail address. Every address is unique. Bitcoins can then be sent to any address, from any address, over the internet. It's like cash - the Bitcoins go directly from person to person, without any banks or credit card fees or anyone collecting your data to advertise to you. 
**Are Bitcoins Secure?**
* Bitcoins are, like cash, as secure as you make them. If you store them on your computer and your computer dies, your bitcoins are gone; so if you own a Bitcoin wallet, you should back it up so even if your computer crashes you don't loose your coins. You should have good antivirus software to make sure your computer doesn't get hacked, and you should practice safe browsing - *all the same good advice you get when you use your regular bank online*. 
 
If this has made you curious and you want to learn more about Bitcoins, there are some excellent resources online! 
(Add in some links to wikipedia, other basic references; maybe have some QR codes people can scan to get info. Don't get too technical. If people can understand the computer geek stuff that's awesome but don't overload them straight away.)

1) Smaller subgroups tend to focus on topics which interest them, and come up with more active participation. So you could say "Why should science fiction lovers who use bitcoin get their own subredidt?" or "Why should people in the London Metro area who use bitcoin want their own subreddit?" The answer is that people in the London Metro area who use bitcoin would have unique, specific discussions about local shops they felt could be persuaded to use bitcoin, and it would be easier to achieve personal networking in a smaller group. Same with women: unique, specific discussions about applications which might not be useful/interesting to a male-dominated subreddit. Things come to the top in smaller subreddits that would get buried in larger ones. I'm not saying the regular bitcoin subreddit is too large; but there are 40k readers and the focus is on a big picture overview of bitcoin. If only 10% of the 40k people on here are women, 400 people is a significant subreddit of its own.   
2) Nope, you're quite right. Women often compete, even when competition is detrimental to both parties. (I have a female co-worker who seems to feel that as another woman in the office, I'm a threat of some sort. She's off her damn rocker; I'm the only person in the office who didn't want her immediately fired for the first 6 months she worked there, and she gave me nothing but shit. But I digress.) 
The roots of the cleavage/perv comment were meant more as a note that there are experiences which are unique to women, which women might sometimes want to get together and discuss. Objecting to this is an odd thing to do; guys often want to get together and just talk guy stuff. Then again, a lot of women *do* object to groups of men getting together to talk guy stuff; they feel men in groups are predatory, while women in groups are not. This is a silly double standard - both groups can be predatory and both can be harmless. 
Then again, several of the comments in this thread were rather derogatory towards women. So perhaps you can see how women might want to take a break from listening to that particular sort of monologue and occasionally visit someplace where that would be less likely to happen, but they could still talk about something interesting besides nail polish and eyeshadow and sutff.

That seems pretty insulting? Like, hangers-on? Although from what I've seen of reality TV, also sadly accurate for some situations. 
I think perhaps the_viper doesn't quite see this from an advertising perspective. Spouses are an untapped audience here. There's a good deal of spending potential. I think, though, that you might have trouble reaching your target group - this is a good start but you want to reach out to more sites where it might be useful. Etsy would be an awesome convert. God, the market share that place has is intense.

Bitcoin, as much as I love it, still has a *long* ways to go. The dollar has evolved over 200 some odd years to be where it is today - there are a lot of inbuilt features that come with the economic mess we find ourselves in which are damn decent things to have. 
That said, I sincerely hope we can learn from the inbuilt features the dollar (and euro and peso and ruble)which are *not* decent things to have, and make Bitcoin a more robust, more egalitarian currency.

"Did you know you can buy gold in Worlds of Warcraft for real money online? 
"Does the real-money price of gold in Worlds of Warcraft change?" 
"Could you invest in gold in Worlds of Warcraft?" 
I often compare Bitcoins to an in-game currency, because people understand fictional games and fictional currencies a lot easier that way (and it doesn't seem as scary). It's basically the same thing, except nobody has built a storyline around the Bitcoin world and the security is a lot better.

Legally, you could file criminal charges or file suit. I'm not certain how much effort the police would put into it, though, or how much knowledge they would have. The area of virtual property as an object which can be stolen and charges filed for in the real world is a developing one; on the upside, your media outlets pushing for the status of digital things being treated as real objects would work in your favor. If you could present it the same way you'd present someone stealing any other digital item, such as a video, you might have a case. That said - it's up to you if you feel it would be worth the time, money and difficulty. Which is probably why everyone else is saying you're out of luck; that amount of money is not enough to interest most lawyers  in the effort and expense of the investigation. 
Personally, this is a real theft and this jackass stole something you worked for. I'd call in a criminal complaint against him for theft. If he lives or holds his rig in another state it could easily become a federal thing. 
You'd need to have certain things ready. Proof you had the money there, proof you were the legitimate owner, proof you were the account holder, stuff like that. If you could collect it all together and had a coherent explanation you could give someone totally unfamiliar with this whole thing, you could persue it. 
Up to you. I'd be pissed if someone stole 1k I'd worked for from me, though. That's a lot of freedom. Leaving it alone might also not be a good example for your little brother.
If you do go the legal route, it might not go smoothly. You should expect people to not understand, and should be prepared to talk this over in *really* simple terms to really, really non-technical people. "I had a virtual thing that I worked for and earned. I left it in the safekeeping of a buisness. The buisness stole it. I want it back or the cash equivalent." Then be ready to provide information and do a lot of work on this.  
Good luck, whatever you decide to do. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:01:40
Thank you for this. I did some research, and while DSI looks like an interesting idea, they don't have the buisness plan in place right now. Planetary Resources does, however.... and some serious backers. And a jobs page. Which I have just forwarded to the husband, because any applications to the sort of thing that involve a cross-country move require partner buy-off. 
So now I hope he wants to move to Seattle and try to work on this because, damn. Damn damn damn. I want to be a part of that dream.

A gender group isn't an interest group? I beg to differ. There are people who are interested in gender and there are people who are not. There are people who are deeply affected by femininity and masculinity, and there are people who are not. If you want to reach the people who are firm believers in gender differences, you have to create a space where they're comfortable discussing things. And there are a *lot* of people who, despite my desperate wish that we'd all just get over our chromosomes, cling to the ideas of gender distinctions mattering. 
So. My wishing won't make anything different, and making them uncomfortable won't make bitcoin more popular. These are the people who don't enjoy science and hard math, and there are a lot of them. Making science and math more interesting and accessible to kids has not made the current crop of folks magically all comfy with tech. So, if we want bitcoin to reach more people in *this* generation instead of waiting 20 years for the tech-savvy bunch to grow up, we need to create spaces where they can have warm fuzzy feelings about using the tech. And sadly, that does mean gender-themed concepts. 
I agree that cross-gender collaboration is both quite necessary if we're to get full value from all the members of our society and vastly more scarce than it should be. Generally speaking, I think we should all be considered people first. But - you can't force that in social situations. The best you can do is give folks a choice.
As to sexism in this subreddit - we might not be viewing this discussion the same way. The first comment string in this thread involves several jovial references to boobs for bitcoins. It's handled lightly by the OP, because she has a goal and that doesn't involve alienating folks - but it could be off-putting if you're not comfortable and familiar with that sort of social environment. A lot of the worse comments below did get downvoted or removed over time - but they were still some of the first reactions to this thread. And reading through the thread, I see a *lot* of references to bitcoin being used, in the context of women, for purchasing a chance to look at women. 
Do you really think there's no sexism in the tech world?

You have to understand that you've broken faith with her and her trust is severely damaged. It can take a very, very long time for that to heal, if it does at all. So you don't get much in the way of an argument if she decides to bail. 
Your initial actions were horrible, and a tremendous betrayal of both your dreams. Your post-loss honesty with her is admirable. That must have been terrifying. 
I suggest you do some studying on the neurology of the gambling dopamine reward system and on finances in general. And give her complete control over your checks, and join and read a couple blogs like [mr. money mustache]( and [get rich slowly](

A lot of folks mock it as political correctness gone rampant, but honestly I can't think of anything positive or even defensible to say about or whatever the hell that subreddit is. SRS do sometimes have a point.

I don't really assume bitcoins are free from surveillance. I just assume someone, somewhere, is always keeping an eye on (or trying to keep an eye on) illegal crap on the internet, and if I digitally wander into someplace with illegal crap, I'll probably be part of their surveillance. So I have a bitcoin (and thank you to the person who was kind enough to sell it to me, right before the price jumped into the hundreds; you are a wonderful person) and I follow the market, and I rejoice when I see new opportunities open up; but I don't for one second think this is a truly anonymous currency. It's a fun currency and I want to see it do well, I want it to be free from most of the issues we see with regulated markets - variety is the spice of life, after all, and there's a solid place for unregulated, mathematically interesting bitcoin in this world just like there is for dollars and euros and rubles. The more monetary systems we have out there, the more likely we are to have surviving economies in case of disaster. 
But - it's on the internet. The internet is not some dark well of mystery - it's very well understood by a lot of very smart people who OCD their way into all sorts of secure places. So it's probably trackable, if someone wanted to put enough effort into it. 
The keyword there is enough effort. Do you really think anyone is going to put the effort into cracking bitcoin for my transaction buying an asthma inhaler? Nope. If, however, I were buying soylent green, or guns or crap like that - yeah, then it might be worth someone's time.

Hmmm. 
"Grandma, it's like poker chips for a casino run by a union you're a part of. You buy some, use them, and then cash them in. And they're almost all on the computer. And anyone who wants to can join the union. It's all so we can use money that's not controlled by a government, because we're worried the economy isn't doing so good, so we decided to make our own instead."

1) My comment wasn't restricted to Bitcoin, which has been nothing but a technological subreddit as far as I can tell. The question above broke the topic away from bitcoin and onto women in general wanting to talk about male-dominated subjects without the men. But if you're interested in why a woman in this subreddit would also be interested in adding a female-oriented subreddit on the topic - I'd like to see different perspectives, different uses of bitcoin. I'd like to see bitcoin succeed and grow, long-term. And women are a key demographic in  the long-term success of any industry. With that in mind, there are areas in social networking which are more female-oriented which men would have a difficult time getting involved in. (Do you tumblr? pintrest?) I'd also like to see bitcoin not restricted to its own niche websites and markets, but reaching out to a larger selling community. A lot of that involves women. 
2) Lots of variables there. Generally, in a male-dominated group of strangers, if a man is being creepy and I would like to feel less unsafe, the first target group of people you as a woman would sort in your head into "likely to have common experience with this problem and be willing to form a group to assist" will be other women. Men are an unknown quantity when the threat is another man. Assuming nobody's riding to the rescue here, are they just not noticing that this guy is being a perv? Am I isolated form the group visually or physically? Does the group generally condone this sort of behaviour? Women are likely to know answers to questions about this situation and be able to give me a better threat assessment of the gentleman in question; men are not likely to have noticed. 
There's also a chance that the women will have relationships already formed with some of the guys in the group, which provides a sort of introduction to men who are "safe".

Ok, so I'm behind the curve - what's a WAG?

If I make my enemy my friend, do I not destroy him? Or in this case - if I infect the enemy and make him into me, haven't I reduced SRS's original joke to a legitimate political statement?

Big lesson in this life: being right and getting rewarded by society are not the same thing. 
Loads of things that are really, really wrong are rewarded by society. Loads of things that are really really right are not. 
This is where you get liars and hypocrites who put on a fake face for social acceptance while secretly living another life as their real selves, and I can't even say they're wrong to be that way.

I know quantum computers are the bane of encryption (theoretically) but hot damn, I can't wait until they're really real (like, something you could buy at the store, not just an MIT term paper.)

Ohh, cool. I might give them a go in a little bit. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:25:42
I.... you.... damn. Not sure if that's evil or genius or both. 
Anyone know some folks in the news industry?
