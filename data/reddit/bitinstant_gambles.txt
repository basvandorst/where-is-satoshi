I really hope my username is completely wrong. So far I've lost $300 on Bitinstant, i.e., sent them $300 6 days ago, but not even the payment has been acknowledged. If current Bitcoin crash affects Bitinstant then I'm afraid I and many others simply gave gifts to them.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:08:30
The linked post doesn't talk about anything like that.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:01:09
Thank you, please invite others to answer and upvote this. We need to alert people of the Bitinstant's situation -- be it good or bad.
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:21:19
I want a reference for that, please. By reference I mean some peer-reviewed paper with enough citations in order to know how good/bad the paper actually is.
@_date: 2013-04-17 04:34:11
It is predicting that the price will go to $ 20 in a few weeks, therefore we can check how good was the prediction. You didn't stop reading before this part, did you ?

Shift 1 then, not 25. Thank you.

Now, seriously, Bitcoin cannot be a serious currency at this point. Maybe this line of though is retard, but a single wealthy person has the possibility of buying the entire currency currently available. I'm sure they also can opt to not buy it entirely, and instead manipulate it as desired for a greater extended profit. Craziness ?

The /contact page sounds better, and we also receive a confirmation email now.
But, for your next iteration of automated emails it would be great if you could use different templates for different situations. For instance, the email I received says:
 "... If you have still not received your funds within 24 hours of your transaction time we will escalate this issue for immediate attention ...".
The problem is that 24 hours has passed several times already, as is the case of a lot of other complaints I've seen. So, why not go ahead and mention in the email that Bitinstant is aware that this specific Order ID is taking too long, and then provide more relevant information ?
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:15:59
I was in the same situation, some bitinstant representative at bitcointalk's forum managed to solve my issue. Give that forum a try, there is a long thread dedicated to providing help for these cases.
@_date: 2013-05-06 01:18:51
Yes, several more now. I've used Vigenére, and successfully imported several private keys into the client, so far all them have 0 balance
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:02:41
By additional transaction fee do you mean a fee over the X% (X = 3.99 for the method I used) already issued ? Despite this, it looks like you're in a better situation than most of us here. I regret using Bitinstant. It seemed to be an easier method to fund MtGox, how wrong I was...
@_date: 2013-05-05 01:58:30
Ah, sure. I did the inverse, I encrypted it instead of decrypting. That is why the shift 1 gave the result
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:17:18
The only thing I can sanely conclude from this whole situation is that bitinstant is gambling with the money/bitcoins in order to rake up a much larger profit (aren't the high fees enough ? too greedy ?).
ZipZap confirmed my payment on April 06, yet Bitinstant doesn't even recognize that a payment occurred. The relevant Quote ID is 276c251e-7f80-4147-ad2c-c3242a9a8192, which looks like exactly the same before paying anything.
@_date: 2013-06-27 19:52:47
I barely know the APIs available in OSX, so I'm curious on how you managed to get such large text over there ("USD/BTC Sell: ...") as can be seen in the screenshot. It certainly isn't a kind of systray icon, these are restricted in both width and height (right ?) so wouldn't work for that.
If you can post the source code or at least comment on how you did this specific part, I would be glad. Thanks, and don't get mad on people, it is fine to be suspicious.
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:35:15
Depends on the plan. If Bitstamp is serious about its service then it should be using the plan that starts at $ 3k/month (which is basically nothing for them). See 
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:36:33
Is Mt. Gox also trying to grab the title of worst AMA ever ? I've read a couple of AMA stories before joining reddit, and I would like to propose this as a contender for the mentioned title.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:53:31
This is really unrelated to HFT. I stood for about 12 hours without placing orders through the streaming API, but then I tried and it told me to wait 285 seconds. Went to the page and placed the order. Tried placing another order some minutes later and then I got a message telling me to wait 295 seconds.
Some days ago I was placing a lot of orders but never hit this issue. I think this is heading towards an API that requires monthly payment, or something related (based on volume, etc). Enjoy while things are free.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:19:52
I'm glad you didn't list Bitinstant aka Scaminstant.

DES is a very well known block cipher. Let us not be sore losers, I also didn't consider using DES.

View into how a Bitclient actually works:  and linked pages like  and 
Current Bitcoin protocol (this is more interesting if you are actually interested in building a Bitcoin client):  Note that Bitcoin doesn't have a specification, the original paper is very light on details and the official Bitcoin client dictates what is the protocol.
Mining protocol:  or the more recent 
I consider these very important pages for people interested on understanding Bitcoin not so superficially.
@_date: 2013-05-06 01:05:36
I have generated two valid private keys based on the clues so far. Too bad none of them contains millions of bitcoin :/
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:28:42
My verification got denied because one of the documents was not in color. Note that such requirement is nowhere to be found (at least it wasn't when I sent, didn't check again). This means they can deny for any arbitrary reason.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:24:51
They came back at 2 am UTC, as promised. And the trading engine lag is already close to 12 mins (they re-opened 24 mins ago as I write this).
@_date: 2013-04-26 05:38:44
Well, the fees applies to every kind of trade, every time. MtGox can already rake a decent amony of money from that, but I can see (but hopefully I'm wrong on that) extra fees being charged if the trading -- including collecting real time information -- is done outside their site.
But, before that happens, they will need to ensure that, for example, placing orders through the API actually places it right after sending the request. Either that or they will launch a free plan which guarantees nothing, and a paid one with guarantees. I hope to be wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-22 04:09:53
I have data locally stored that was collected through the MtGox streaming api, and at least for the timestamp 1366082046 (April 16, 2013 - 03:14:06) there were 40 trades. I don't locally store all the trades 24h/day, so there are possibly other seconds with 40 trades or more from MtGox.

I really hope my username is completely wrong. Bitcoin has crashed now, if Bitinstant fails to deliver then we can known that my username is correct; or Bitinstant now has a huge loan to pay back.
@_date: 2013-05-05 01:53:28
That key I pasted is the result of your procedure.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:52:10
Wow, it looks like I'm in the same boat. ZipZap confirmed my transfer and fastly answered my doubts regarding the payment, but Bitinstant never gave me an Order Id. In my case it has only been six days, but Bitinstant never answered anything. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 13:12:24
Do you have any concrete information that HTTP API is "very stable and reliable" and not only "cached outdated information is returned" ? The HTTP API have no guarantees about providing recent updated data, it can and does serve outdated data when compared to the Streaming API. This can be seen very easily by requesting depth market info, for example. Pure HTTP is stateless, so it makes no sense to talk about uptime.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:22:24
This Bitcoin paper is way too light on details. It's the current implementation of Bitcoin clients (actually only the official one) that drive how Bitcoin technically works. Said that, the bitcoin's wiki contain much more relevant and complementary information to that paper; for instance, at  you can grasp how Bitcoin actually works.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:22:35
The complaints are at least in the hundreds: 224 pages in that support thead which is a mix of complaints and "thanks for the help". Add to that a lot of other complaints here in reddit alone. There are also all those complaints sent to bitinstant's email, which is better known as a black hole. Also, you are not counting in the people that are too kind to not complain in public (or in different places that bitinstant workers aren't looking at).
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:20:02
Argh!! I waited 2 weeks for getting a fucking "sorry, gray pic" basically. It is at a very decent resolution, and the colored version is basically a green-tone version of it instead of the gray-tone. I really hope MtGox deletes my documents and all the others rejected before they get hacked and a lot of very personal information is leaked.
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:52:02
Is there any advantage to use this over the one provided through the streaming API ?
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:42:57
Any plans to support other cryptocurrencies (in especial Litecoin) ? It would fit perfectly with the app's name.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:45:39
How can you honor the price at time of deposit ? Does that mean if  someone sends you 300 dollars today and the price of bitcoin is X, then if Bitinstant takes 2 weeks to process the transfer and bitcoins gets to price 5X, are you going to convert 300 dollars into 1500 dollars ? I would love to get such thing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:59:48
Currently I believe Bitcoin is vulnerable to hoarding, don't you think so ? It looks like to be exactly the case given the opinions in the bitcointalk.org forum; a lot of people there tell others to hold into their Bitcoins because it will be very valuable. If holding into them isn't hoarding, then I don't understand what is.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:30:53
It doesn't, are you reading the same post ? 
It is just superficially explaining Bitcoin, you might be talking about a different post.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:54:23
It looks like there is a lot of manual processing involved, shouldn't this be done in a much more automatized way ? Otherwise, I don't see how having only 5 people is enough.
Anyway, I cannot claim you are profiting from this, but to me it looks like pretty much to be the case given how easy it would be to do so. All I have for the moment is a Quote ID (not even an Order ID), why didn't I manage to get one of these pretty Order IDs even though ZipZap confirmed my payment 5 days ago ?
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:01:25
Foremost: I have no opinion on how much one Bitcoin will be worth at some given point.
Now, it could be the case that Bitcoin isn't even experiencing the "First sell off" point yet -- it is just a matter of smoothing more the graph regarding the Bitcoin valuation given a certain exchange. The media attention received so far would be meaningless in this smoothed graph, supposing at some point there will be a much higher media coverage. I also don't think the public in general is aware of Bitcoin. While in certain localized places/groups/regions this might be the case, in a more general sense it is certainly not the case. I have a couple of decently informed colleagues who don't know about Bitcoin, simply because the relevant media hasn't covered yet or because it was so badly covered that it got ignored. I could keep going with this, but it is all my own speculation.
As a final point, I believe this greater media attention will happen when the limit of 21 million issued Bitcoins is close to happen.

I was trying to decode NakamotootomakaN using be27e988aceee39cd938f1f6fc7954c6ad7675b9e55dac06 to get the supposedly last part X of the key. So the private key would be 5 X sBsLT85KeowaTBPC9 WUJuRM2WeUaXq4ZrE or 5 sBsLT85KeowaTBPC9 X WUJuRM2WeUaXq4ZrE.

That explanation together with  sums up Bitcoin pretty well, and correctly, given the target audience.
But a "less-naïve-person" might prefer something describing one-way functions, and a more technical person might prefer to read relevant pages in Bitcoin's wiki along the official client's code.

I don't see how it matters whether 100% or 1% of the ~11m current Bitcoins are being traded. This single person could buy even 100% were, or it could manipulate all the trading instead. Of course this doesn't please this subreddit.
