Yes, that is correct. The private keys you have on Electrum now can be used to transact BTC on the BTC chain AND BCH on the BCH chain. When you transfer your BTC balance, that will "use" the BTC keys, but the same keys can still be used to populate your new BCH wallet. 
Essentially, the chains have split and your keys are currently valid on both chains. Using the keys on one does not use them on the other.

Claiming your Bitcoin Cash BCH (BCC). Read whole comment before taking action:
- You must have had your BTC Bitcoin in a wallet at the time of the fork so you can access the private keys. 
- You can't export your BTC from an online service (exchange) to a wallet now as that will generate new keys. You won't lose your BTC, but you can't claim your BCH. 
- To claim your BCH, simply create a BCH wallet somewhere and import the BTC private keys you had at the time of the fork. 
- The security concern is that the new BCH wallet might not be trustworthy and could use those same private keys to access your BTC. 
- Therefore, recommended order is:
 A) Record/write down the BTC private keys somewhere (securely). 
 B) Transfer your BTC somewhere, i.e to a different BTC wallet or exchange. That "uses" the BTC keys so they can't be used again to access your BTC. 
 C) Open a BCH wallet and import the private keys you wrote down. 
 D) Voila, you now have both BTC and BCH safely.

I have no preference, but there's no hurry to choose as long as you have a note of the BTC private keys you had before the fork. Write them down before you transact your BTC.

Correcto. And you don't need a new wallet, just transacting the out somewhere and back again will give you new keys for the same BTC.

You'll likely have multiple keys. Enter them all, one by one.

This one looks good, although I don't really understand what it is telling me.

I have done it with Coinomi. Go into your BCH wallet in Coinomi and use the menu option to sweep a wallet. This then allows you to enter the private keys and it imports your BCH.

Need another place to watch the fork. Anyone have any?

Thanks Jaxx, that's good to hear. I just started using Jaxx and it's good so far.
