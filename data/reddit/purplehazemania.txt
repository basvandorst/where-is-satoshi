I have relatives that are literally living of Bitcoin with trading and mining. The electricity costs are ridiculously cheap but you need to be careful with the amount of miners that you set up due to police cracking down operations. Even if you limit yourself to only trading; as long as you make conservatives daily trades and make $90 a month, you are making 6 times the current minimum wage.
That video definitely reflects reality over there and that is just the tip of the iceberg. The constant news and media that I get to see on my social medias are just sad; what my family is living in Venezuela right now is no joke. I've been living outside of the country for the past 7 years and I have not visited in the last 2 years.

I'm from Venezuela and I have several relatives involved in the Bitcoin business over there. I don't live there anymore but since I trade Bitcoins I'm in a few whatsapp groups full of venezuelans talking every day about bitcoin; the mining movement is crazy. There was a CNBC video about the current situation in Venezuela with Bitcoin, you should watch it if you are interested in the subject...

Its not illegal. However, the SEBIN (Bolivarian Intelligent Service) has been cracking down a number of mining operations in Venezuela and accusing them of financing terrorism, stealing electricity, money laundering etc. My partners from Caracas tell me that most of the raids happen when there is a really big operation going on, and the police keeps most of the machines to start their own mining operation. Apparently they do not understand the technical part of the mining part but they can afford to pay a technician to set the mining machines for them.
