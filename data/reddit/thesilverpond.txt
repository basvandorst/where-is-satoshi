Hodl on sweet child

in the same boat, except I bought at 17.2 because of FOMO. Hopefully it rises up soon. My lesson that I learned was never buy at an ATH. Especially when it's a significant amount. It's a better idea to buy the dip

The Golden rule: Only invest what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:19:12
Never buy at an ATH, always HODL through the pain

It's working for some people, coinbase can't handle the traffic so we'll need to wait so they can get their shit together

An ideal item for any HODLR

that guy took HODLING to another level

Stupid FUD-biscuit. I rebuke you devil!

HODL until death
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:11:37
You know you HODL when you have nightmares of price drops
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:10:09
wait until tomorrow Lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:58:17
The answer is simple. More memes
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:36:04
Because of the crazy high fees and the fact that it takes so long to send bitcoin from one exchange to another, No. It wouldn't be beneficial

CME trades futures on the 18th. Big boys incoming. I doubt they have enough capital to influence Bitcoin's 250+ Billion dollar market cap though

Agressive Hodling
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:14:15
moral of the story is: HODL through the storm
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:16:32
Nope, you're fucked. Should've HODLED
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:14:57
I can see the sunlight! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:35:32
I haven't seen quality memes since we broke 10k
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:12:29
I believe the futures are what are causing the market change right now. Hopefully they give up trying to manipulate the market and tomorrow bitcoin shoots to the moon

That's the day Wall Street firms will begin to trade bitcoin futures, many suspect that Wall Street has been manipulating the market as of recently. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:32:20
Don't forget bitcoin is powered by memes. More memes = More money
