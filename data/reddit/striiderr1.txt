I understand everyone’s frustrations on what happened (and the posts related to it in r/Coinbase) but it’s nice to see the blame doesn’t stand on the crypto side of things and the problem was with a trusted established entity and shows they make mistakes too. Hopefully it helps gain trust again in Coinbase.

You’re either an older person that is catching up on past missed visual opportunities, or a young person in search of some golden classics. If your the latter, may I suggest Willow, The Princess Bride, Krull, Time Bandits, Legend and Dark Crystal. I hope this comment means a lot to you too.

Released Bcash early or failed to announce it was allowing purchase of Bcash on Coinbase beforehand? That was a fuckup on their part and do you really think Brian Armstrong has control of the personal integrity of the individuals in the know and what they chose to do with that knowledge? Again this happens in other companies and services, not just crypto. 
That is not the only thing that can fuck up the market in Crypto (eg. McAfee/Twitter much?).

This free paper gets a fairly wide distribution on public services around the UK. Well written for newbies and hopefully draws more curiosity/investors to the tech.

That may stand true for mainstream corporations and entities but this is cryptocurrency we’re taking about, we’re still in the Wild West days of it all and it’s a long time before we get to a complete fair trade POV. 
It’s a lot closer to the crypto side of things than Visa is.

I’ve not seen the date 16th February (Chinese New Year) mentioned (or in any other posts) and the possible affect that could be having on crypto prices right now. Am I the only one that thinks this has got to be a contributing factor, as I would imagine a lot of cash in that area (China/Korea) would be pulled out on the run up to the this date. Post this date I would think we’d see more money being re-invested.

Some golf clubs are still reluctant to adopt women members like its 1910. I don’t think BTC is bothering them too much.

That I can’t argue with, he sure as shit should have control of the release dates and I’m not sure if a satisfactory explanation still has been given as to why that choice was made. Regardless it was a total fuck up. 
Who wants to buy copycat Bcash anyway..? ��

I personally haven’t had any direct issues with them and yes I agree they should have/should be implementing 2X and fees are higher than other places. I personally can’t comment of them holding back peoples money, I haven’t experienced it personally. There will always be examples of where service has failed and this is true for any and all companies, things go wrong sometimes (Hello Visa ��). 
I’ve tried to join other platforms (I’ve been waiting over 6weeks for my passport/identity to be verified on Gemini) and still waiting. At least with Coinbase, my first venture into crypto was a smooth one, I was instantly verified by them and was able to purchase crypto (within an hour), that’s great for new people to the game! Yes the fees are a little higher but I pay that in the knowledge they’re a regulated company and not the riskiest option out there.
