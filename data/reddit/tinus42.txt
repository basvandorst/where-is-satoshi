In the '90s there were lots of newspaper articles about the internet which said that it was only for criminals and which mocked concepts such as web commerce.
This one cuts the cake: 
Which a genious quote such as:
"Then there's cyberbusiness. We're promised instant catalog shopping—just point and click for great deals. We'll order airline tickets over the network, make restaurant reservations and negotiate sales contracts. Stores will become obselete. So how come my local mall does more business in an afternoon than the entire Internet handles in a month? Even if there were a trustworthy way to send money over the Internet—which there isn't—the network is missing a most essential ingredient of capitalism: salespeople."
The author though has later admitted being wrong and he wasn't a uneducated knowit-all journalist, he had been involved in the early internet scene. Mind you it is still funny.

Sorry for your loss. Can't imagine how it must feel.
I sometimes feel depressed that I hadn't heard of bitcoin earlier because I know I would have gotten into it, I did immediately when I learned about it in early 2013. I have several full full bitcoins but otherwise I'm dirt poor and can only get crap low paying jobs now and then because I'm middle aged and employers here want to have a "young team" so they don't hire older people unless they have special skils. It is tempting to cash in the coins but if I would spend them they are gone forever and I'll never get that kind of money ever again. So I dare not spend them. People say that 1 bitcoin might make you a millionaire but that might take 20 years and I'll be old when that happens. Wish I had heard about it earlier than early 2013 so I could have mined with a PC before the ASICs took over.

It helps for me that even though Bitcoin OMFG CRASHED! !1 the price it "tanked" to is still 4 times as high as the average price I bought in at and 20 times as high as the price of the first Bitcoin I bought.

A person earning $1000 in a western country is poor because they have to spend everything they make on their cost of living. Even though they make more than twice the amount you mentioned annually.

At the time, I was trying to speak against the tide of futuristic commentary on how The Internet Will Solve Our Problems.
Gives me pause. Most of my screwups have had limited publicity: Forgetting my lines in my 4th grade play. Misidentifying a Gilbert and Sullivan song while suddenly drafted to fill in as announcer on a classical radio station. Wasting a week hunting for planets interior to Mercury’s orbit using an infrared system with a noise level so high that it couldn’t possibly detect ‘em. Heck – trying to dry my sneakers in a microwave oven (a quarter century later, there’s still a smudge on the kitchen ceiling)
And, as I’ve laughed at others’ foibles, I think back to some of my own cringeworthy contributions.
Now, whenever I think I know what’s happening, I temper my thoughts: Might be wrong, Cliff…

That's a rather ageist remark of Jinyoung. Ted Nelson gets Bitcoin and he's far over 70. There are a lot of young guys who don't even know 0.1 percent of what he knows about it.
With a lot of young people the concept of "having come of age on the internet" equates with being great at retweeting and liking on Facebook. But ask them anything about how the internet works and you likely see their eyes glaze over. The people who designed the internet are of the same age as Nelson (he in fact laid the groundwork for the World Wide Web).
Being over 40 it's me who the family asks to fix their computer, not my under 20 social media savvy nephews.

Most people who are interested in Bitcoin don't go to meetups. I've been to one meetup and the people there were mostly business types who were looking at ways to make money out of it. That's not what interests me about Bitcoin (although it's surely nice that my meagre holdings have become worth a bit more than before). So I don't think I'll go to one again.

Donald accurately predicted that the block chain would grow out of proportions:

If hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of bandwidth - each must know all, or a substantial part thereof."

I guess the real difference is that you Reddit because you find it enjoyable not because you want to support Reddit (if you wanted to do that you'd buy Gold). Setting up a node can be enjoyable too but once it's running you keep it running unless something goes wrong or need to update. Being ultrasecure and supporting Bitcoin because you believe in it (which might give you a good feeling like when you donate to charity) seem to be the main reasons for running a node. Most Bitcoin users probably don't feel incentiviced by them. There would be many more nodes if they had some incentive which would motivate them to set up one. Maybe there will be some foundation someday that hands out free nodes and pays people for keeping them running and then there might be hundreds of thousands or even millions of them instead of thousands. I don't know how many nodes Bitcoin needs to run smoothly, but the more nodes there are the harder it will be for governments to try to shut it down.

Many homeless people do have mental problems. Also the system is stacked against them. If you don't have a home you don't have an address. If you don't have an address you can't get a bank account. If you don't have a bank account you can't get a job and you can't pay taxes. You can only get illegal jobs for cash. Try improving your life then whilst still following the rules.

I would keep 6 months in cash to cover your rent and bills. Since your rent is 0 and your bills are negligible that would be only a small amount. So go for it, at your age you can recoup it as it's much easier to get a job as a young person (provided you are not to demanding about what kind of work you want to do). At best you'll never have to work again in a decade or more at worst you have had a painful setback you can recover from. It's different if for someone at retirement age, they don't have decades to recoup the money through work so they have to be more careful with their money and not stick it in a risky investment like Bitcoin (unless they have some spare cash to play around with which they can miss if they lose it).
You could be prudent and save a few thousand in cash for unknown circumstances as your situation could change rapidly (such as your parent's house catching fire and then you would be homeless if they aren't insured properly or they have to move to a smaller house with no space for you).

Asicminer can get people to buy at this price because no other company can deliver ASICS on demand. It's all pre-order here, pre-order there and you just have to hope that you will get your product in time before the difficulty makes it useless. By now you'd expect there would have been several competitors who can ship directly. But no, there's only Asicminer who can do that right now. So they can set any price they like and people can take it or leave it.

In 2009, 2010 and 2011 I was working in the two most soul destroying crappy jobs of my life. I hated going to work every day and felt like kicking my head against a wall after I left work.
If I hadn't worked there I might had read about Bitcoin on some technical blog and tried out mining.
So I feel doubly crap about those years now. When I hear a song or watch a movie from those years I keep thinking about Bitcoin.
Also my family all have really great well paying jobs and they can always afford new stuff whilst I have only had low paying jobs and I'm rather jealous that they have everything so together whilst I live paycheck to paycheck and have to worry about paying my bills every month. They never say it but I feel they look down upon me for not doing so well as them.
Now only have saved up a bit over 2 Bitcoins, which was hard to do (even though I got the first for only 14 euro's) as I don't have much spare cash at the end of the month to buy more than a tiny amount. I fear that it has peaked already and won't go further. Because I find it hard to imagine someone willing to pay $5000 or $10,000 for one. $1,000 already seems way over the top.
I keep thinking had I found out about Bitcoin earlier my life could have been so much better. I could do something I really enjoy (like taking up a study or go travelling) and not feel stuck, like I do now.

I am Dutch also and I've always questioned the practice of giving gift cards over cash. With gift cards you force people to spend them on a certain good or service. And most gift cards are voided after a year. It happened several times that I found gift cards after a year that I had laid aside because I couldn't think what to spend them on which had become worthless by then. Give me cash any day, I can spend it on what I like and I can use it whenever I like. If you want to make it special put it in a nice package.

You can have your coins on a Blockchain.info wallet and then use the Blockchain.info app which requires you to enter a pin. No different than using a debitcard. If you lose the phone you still have your coins as they are stored online. Better change the pin to make sure of course.
Blockchain.info has the best security I've seen on any Bitcoin wallet site, you have to enter your password/phrase if you want to change anything and it automagically logs you out after a few mins. If you enable 2-factor then you are even more secure, just as secure as your bank account (provided Blockchain.info doesn't fold of course, but after Cyprus bank accounts are also not so safe as they used to be).

This is true. People who say "money does not make you happy" generally have enough of it to live comfortable without worrying whether they can pay the bills at the end of the month and if they can put a hot meal on the table.
For someone who lives from paycheck to paycheck money does bring happiness. It enables possibilities for them. Even it's as simple as going on a trip outside ones hometown, let alone going on vacation.
For many people even many small things that others take for granted are luxuries they can't afford, like going to a movie, buying birthday presents for their children (or even buy them new clothes). They would be overjoyed if someone gave them $100.

Why would CCTV air not one but two long items about Bitcoin if the Chinese government wanted to stop it? Surely they would have either ignored it or attacked it strongly. CCTV = the voice of the Chinese government. The Chinese government promotes the ownership of gold and silver by the Chinese public. I reckon they want the Chinese people to also hold Bitcoin. There is a major currency war going on at the moment, I think the Chinese government for now views Bitcoin as another tool in their currency war chest. And they figure they can control the (for them) negative side of it of more anonymity (which is a fallacy because all transactions are publicly recorded and thus patterns could be detected which lead to individuals unless they are extremely careful).

At least here in the Netherlands it's relatively easy to buy Bitcoins. There are three sites as I know which sell Bitcoin using iDEAL (the Dutch online bank payment service): bitonic.nl, happycoins.nl and wemaxtrading.nl. Margins may not be as attractive as the more well-known Bitcoin exchanges but you can buy Bitcoins from a regular bank account.
From age 12 years one can open a young person's bank account with iDEAL access at ASN bank and probably also at other banks.

No wallets are not linked to either your username (Bitcoin doesn't require a username) or your real name. Though transactions possibly could be traced back to your IP address, which could be used to identify you. You can use Bitcoin over TOR, that way you could mask your IP address. Makes it much more difficult to trace it back to you but not impossible. It's a cat and mouse game to get anonymity on the internet, with Bitcoin that's not different. Unless you want to do something like laundering money, financing a terrorist group or buying drugs on the Silk Road I wouldn't bother too much about it.

A lot of their readers are going to be disappointed. Easy cash by mining Bitcoin is no longer a reality.

Why did you use a Linux version that was over 10 years old back then? 0.95b is from 1992.

Olga Ruff should get in touch with Coinbase or Bitpay. They make it really easy to accept Bitcoin. She could instantly convert her Bitcoins for dollars if she wanted to.

Unfortunately the country I live in (NL) is doing its best to emulate the US in taking away freedoms for the "greater good". But just to lose your property because some federal againt claims you must have earned it through crime without having recourse in a court, that is not something we see here (yet).

That's what I worry about. Many people who founded'90s internet startups had big ideas about changing the world for the better. Some had motto's like "Don't be evil". Now they are helping the US government to spy on their own people in a more encompasing way than the East German Stasi did. They only had dossiers on suspected dissidents. The NSA has files on each citizen. 
Will the "new wealthy elite" of Bitcoin suck up to government in a decade or two as much as the internet moguls have now?

They are just lucky to get a settlement from Facebook. And their daddy is rich so they must have a nice trust fund.

What's this got to do with Bitcoin? I've seen this docu years ago and Bitcoin isn't mentioned (it's from 2010, Bitcoin was hardly in the picture back then).

In 2006 it was YOU.
Yes YOU!

She is very talented. She should go places. I'm not much of an art afficionado but this I like!

I glad I ditched Robberbank for ABN-AMRO years ago. Not much better really but at least they don't block Bitcoin-related transactions. Really winning to have an ethical commission, which should do better passing judgement on their bank's LIBOR manipulation for which they were convicted (only to pass the fine as losses to Dutch tax payers)

Merry Christmas Jason!
I hope you well for the next year.
I'd like to see a reportage from Satoshi Forest, seeing how the homeless people live there from the donations in Bitcoin.
I can empathize with them as I am rather poor myself and could be on the brink of becoming homeless myself next year due to the harsher political climate that benefits the banks and the rich over the common people who increasingly have to suffer worse working conditions or lose their jobs, in which case the benefits system is being made more sober.
I donated to you a few months ago but I only want to donate again when I have some money left to replenish the donated Bitcoins and the end of year period is quite expensive. My Bitcoins serve as a buffer for the hard times that are coming and hopefully in a decade or two as a retirement fund. I'm over 40 and otherwise have nearly no savings and retirement funds.
All the best and season's greetings!

It's also why I'm hashing away with my USB Block Erupter even though it won't make ROI. Fuck ROI. Fuck the greedy mentality that puts money first last and middle. Fuck the banks!
