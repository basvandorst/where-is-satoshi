As with anything in life there is normal distribution of individual traders, the majority of whom cannot outperform the market, but that doesn't mean there isn't a small percentage with the skills and experience to make alot of money

Point 3 is just wrong. Have you never heard of renaissance technologies?

Just as correlation doesn't equate to causation, the lack of correlation doesn't imply the lack of causation either. As others have pointed out, there are too many other factors involved to take an isolated quantitative approach.

What the... you are saying that my examples aren't valid because they happened in the past??? I don't think you understand... Greeks and Venezuelans, had they invested in BTC prior to the collapse of their currencies, would have had their wealth better preserved due to the BTC hedge. All countries carry some varying degree of inflation risk which does not correlate with BTC price.

To boil down the definition of smart investing into avoiding risky assets shows a very elementary understanding of investing in my opinion. A million things could be said to expand on this, but at a very basic level in the video alone he explains that crypto is not correlated to many of the factors that drive the price of traditional assets such as gdp. So in essence adding some percentage of crypto, while standalone may have higher than normal risk, would in fact act as a hedge and reduce the overall risk level of your portfolio.

Some people use algorithms which make bitcoin trades partly  based on Google search popularity.

Ok again you are missing the point or aren't familiar the concept of hedging. When economies fail, do you think almond farms or motor oil companies are making more profit? Maybe an example outside of BTC you would understand better. I'm sure you're aware biotech stocks have a very high risk profile. Would you agree however that a portfolio with 90% agriculture stocks and 10% biotech has a lower level of risk and therefore higher leverage than a portfolio with 100% agriculture? In this example the two investments aren't necessarily even anti-correlated, whereas it is arguable that because people flock to BTC in times of weakening economy/infation, the two investments are anti-correlated which further reduces risk.

Tell that to the Greeks or Venezuelans
