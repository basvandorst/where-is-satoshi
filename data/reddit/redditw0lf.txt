You are not infringing on any laws. It sounds like the person on the phone didn't know too much about cryptocurrency, you should be able to escalate this but chances are you have hit a blacklisted site such as a bitcoin mining site, and as such you've been blocked. :(
If need be, move the bitcoin wallet to another device or take a note of the private key, take the device in with the bitcoin software removed and then get reconnected

EDURoam is not always ran by the school. Many schools are connected to EDURoam so for all he knows he could transfer to another EDURoam enabled school.

No worries please let us know how you get on! Would love to hear how this gets resolved, i'm hoping smoothly.

MAC address changing won't work as it's done via a single sign on to access the whole of EDURoam

In a way kind of, so my old computer was airgapped and the OS reinstalled, I used a webcam to scan the QR code of the address i wanted to send to, signed it, then placed the transaction data on a memory stick in a text file and broadcast it on my "live" device to the bitcoin network.
A hardware wallet has your keys and your computer tells it "sign this transaction for me", it signs it off of the computers OS (after you press a button on the device commonly to confirm the address etc is correct). Then sends it back to the computer to broadcast. Meaning your computer never sees or has the private keys.
Hope that helps and I can assure you the hardware wallet was a LOT easier and to me had less shortcomings than a airgapped PC :)

If you get a server or a VPS off campus you could run one there but it's a bit of work to setup and can cost about 5 bucks a month, i run a few to help the network :)

What do you mean by disappear? Is Bitcoin of yours vanishing? If so you're doing something horribly wrong

No worries man, the easiest way to sign the transaction offline and take it to a "internet computer" essentially is a hardware wallet nowadays.
When i started this there wasn't many h/w wallets and a disconnected laptop was as close as you could get :)

You can sign the transaction offline and then take the signed transaction to another, internet connected computer to broadcast :)

Just be warned using PayPal with local bitcoins normally involves a level of verification because of the fraud PayPal to BTC have seen in the past where the PayPal funds have been reversed due to fraud and the scammer of course runs away with btc. 
For the same high risk reason buying bitcoin with PayPal has a lot higher cost normally also.

That's very interesting, I'm having the same issue with coin base and it has now been two weeks, moved to another service now

You don't always have to consent, many people have been able to trick phone providers into cloning their number over without the consent.

I'm not in the states I'm in the UK and I get 1 hour delivery :) I guess where you are they don't operate with local warehouses yet?

Amazon is not a shitty UK book store. They are a massive online retailer and a marketplace in some cases.
You can buy both food and clothing online on the regular, we have a amazon fresh order come weekly and they have a fashion section I sometimes use for my clothing.

This is not always the case. Some altcoins like Litecoin can support more transactions by design and support Segwit to help it scale in the future. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:57:25
Litecoin has activated Segwit and appears to have been built around the idea of a higher capacity in part so it should be fine to start using Litecoin
