If you have all three keys, why do you need their recovery tools?
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:07:30
Is it connected to the hack?
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:55:09
You must act quickly if you plan on doing this.

I doubt we would want a "war" with china overnight (unless you mean stealing middle east oil).

P.S. I lost my keys to all my wallets. Please hard-fork to give back my coins.

I think he's saying that since the software is new and alpha and people don't trust and all that, most people wouldn't see them as safe until they got into the blockchain. It's like when they invented checks. Checks would be meaningless unless eventually you could convert them to cash.

I think how it works is that for each person your doing transactions with, you have to commit money to them. For example, if I want to trade with Alice and Bob and have 20 BTC, I would commit (on Blockchain) a budget of 10 BTC for Alice and 10 BTC for Bob. Since these funds can now only go to them, they don't have to check the block chain. If I send Bob 9 BTC of my 10, he knows that it is his, because those 10 can only go to him.
The network element is what makes this easier to use. If I want to send Alice 15 bitcoins, I can send here 10 through my to Alice channel, and then 5 to Bob, who sends 5 to Alice. Cryptography makes sure Bob can not steal the 5 coins.
Or at least, I think this is how it works.

It would be a change in the protocol. (P.S. what is the difference between hard fork and soft fork? I understand that hard fork is bigger change, but besides that, idk.)
@_date: 2016-05-24 00:04:12
Yeah, it's much better to use a public algorithm, and to use your brain instead of a computer to prevent hacking.
@_date: 2016-05-17 03:13:49




Did he say whether they plan to do this?

Actually, its Satoshi. I've decided to reveal myself to save Bitcoin.
I will proof my identity via this: satoshin This is satoshi's email, something only Satoshi would know.
As a second proof, my true name is Yourvik Jopile, another thing only Satoshi would know.

All a politician has to do is write down "a bajillion dollars" on a scrap piece of paper. Debt problem solved! Cheap too.

Nope, because then everyone chooses 1/2 of the previous average (or less), and you quickly approach 0.
Also, miners can manipulate this system by sending themselves bitcoins with huge fees.

That way someone can't be like "oh, you're standing rather close to that server with a node. Do you own it?" And then you're like "not necessarily", and they're like "you definitely do, I'm telling Mom what you bought", and you're like "it's a coincidence, I swear, I've never seen that node in my life" and etc.
@_date: 2016-05-12 22:05:33
I was thinking relative to the transacted value. Would per kb be better?

I think the users stand a much better chance of surviving a war of attrition than the miners. Also, I bet new miners could rise up within 24 hours, especially given that their would be large transaction fees.
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:25:55
It would in large part be determined by the economic majority, not raw number of nodes. Likely, it would be the exchanges representing users. (Miners just need to make sure they can sell/use their coins.)
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:21:42
It would be bad for us, but it would be worse for them.
Practically, economic forces would kick in and once they saw we weren't accepting their fork, most of them would immediately jump ship back to us.
That is a good observation though. Bitcoin needs a more sophisticated difficulty adjustment algorithm.

Lightning network is on chain, but only very infrequently.
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:18:28
People were actually concerned about this, because they didn't know better.
@_date: 2016-07-02 22:29:34


I talked about the specific case where the miners and economic majority disagree.

Trump is no ordinary Republican. He switches parties a lot, for one.

They accept the highest valid chain. If a block doesn't conform to the protocol, it's rejected the matter what.
