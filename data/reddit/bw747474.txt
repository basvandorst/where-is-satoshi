I agree with you long term.  But for banks, it can be a threat, and also an opportunity.  The first banks to jump on board can lead in custody and payment processing.  There's money to be made for them, and that's why you see ICE jumping into trading and payments.  Binance and Coinbase are making a killing.  The banks that lag could get crushed.
Bitcoin has several important advantages right now.  (1) It's scarce, which means people will be inclined to hold it. (2) International transactions far easier. (3) It can be used as cash, which means no charge-backs. (4) It has a lot of buzz, and that generates trading opportunities/revenue.  (5) One can put their entire net worth into it, move to another county, and have capital to play with.
I foresee a sizable role for banks, especially in the near future, as 99% of the population is accustomed to using an intermediary for transactions and custody.  That will likely change over time, but first there is a lot of work to be done before its ready for everyday folk as an everyday currency.

I believe bitcoin is a better store of value because it may be the only resource in the universe where you are disincentivized to produce more than 21 million.  You can always mine more gold, here on earth or in the heavens, but it's not in the network participants best interest to create more bitcoin, as it just devalues their own holdings.  Thus, greed works for the people who hold it instead of against them.   This is the true beauty of the system.
Gold can be stolen also, and while it may not be vulnerable to an EMP,  if an EMP took out the entire modern world, I'm pretty sure holding gold would be the least of my worries.
Last, there is no kill switch. There are way to many people who have reviewed the bitcoin code.  While you can hack my wallet, it is becoming nearly impossible to hack the blockchain itself in any meaningful way (the cost of undoing a recent transaction is very high).

I largely agree. I think they would be beneficial for a couple reasons. They can provide custody and payment processing, but perhaps more importantly, they raise awareness.  Right now, if you meet with a wealth advisory at BofA, they are not going to recommend you own bitcoin.  But if they can make money selling you bitcoin, they will start advising clients to purchase some as part of a balanced portfolio.  Let's face it, as much as us redditers can tout the benefits of crypto currencies, it's  not the same as having a Certified Financial Planner recommend it.  We are still on the fringe (which is what makes it such a great potential investment).  Average folks don't think about what gives a currency value, or why scarcity matters.

Does bitcoin scale with 1 mb blocks without payment processors?  I’m not so sure lightning is going to do the trick without a large number of centralized nodes.  Today, bitcoin allows you the option to avoid banks, which is great, but the goal of getting rid of them all together for payments seems to be way off in the distant future. Security and decentralization have been prioritized over speed and throughout.  (I am not arguing this was a bad trade off, merely pointing out the facts).

I have to chuckle at this gold bug mentality analysis.
If we have an apocalypse, gold will be reduced to a worthless rock, and no one is going to trade for it.  Instead, you will be more likely trading in Advil pills or bullets.  Gold is also nearly completely worthless as a true medium of exchange, as hardly anyone can judge its purity and it's weight must be measured before each transaction.  
I terms of banking, gold's only value is if it is used to peg or back a currency.  And that requires gold storage, and 3rd party issuer of paper currency.  In short, for gold to be used for anything barter related, it requires a central bank.

I am very aware of the history of money.  Gold is simply not a good medium of exchange without paper money to complement it, which means 3rd party trust is required. Gold can be counterfeited, it’s heavy, and not easy to divide.  It’s no accident gold is not widely used for transactions today. 
In a modern society, is gold better than govt fiat because its supply can’t be as easily increased. And right now, gold more stable than bitcoin.  I agree gold has a role in the global economy (central banks are hoarding it now), but the post i was replying to was outlining apocalyptic scenarios, for which i submit gold (or bitcoin) will have no real value.

I am talking about insolvency.  Your talking about a run of the mill recession.
Rates will start skyrocketing because no one will buy the US debt.  Higher rates will be needed to attract buyers. Then, the debt problem will compound because the interest expense of deficits/debt goes through the roof.  After exhausting buyers, and pushing the govt to the brink of default, as the buyer of last resort, the fed will flood the system with dollars, purchasing bonds and driving yields way below the rate of inflation.  You won’t want to be in bonds because you will be repaid with deflated dollars. Inflation will be running at 8 percent and your 10 year will be paying 3 percent. 
Deflating the debt through inflation is the only way out other than default, which would be even worse.  Default would cripple the balance sheets of nearly all US banks.
Scary part is, modern financial theory uses volatility as a measure of risk. They are not the same. Bonds are not volatile, but in a bout of inflation they are highly risky.  Most people are totally unprepared.
By the way, I’m no doomsday prepper.  I generally tend to be optimistic. However, Western Govt finances are getting so bad that even I can see the writing on the wall.

Your either missing the point, or ignoring it.   Yes, I believe miners would spend money/hash power to disrupt and destabilize a POW coin that forked from Bitcoin supported by exchanges.   In fact, I believe one of them publicly stated as much. 
If the scenario you are suggesting, miners would not spend money disrupting the network, were true, than the block size issue would have been resolved 2 years ago.  The nodes would have switched and the miners would have followed along.  
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:54:16
Seems like that sort of logic is prevalent throughout bitcoin.   Investors, developers, libertarians all taut bitcoin's potential.  Yet, they sometimes fail to recognize that bitcoin's potential lies in different use cases for different people.   For many, a bitcoin banking system is extremely useful. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:13:31
I wish I could agree with you.  The problem is that the miners have different economic incentives than exchanges and users, who benefit from volume.  Miners essentially benefit from congestion, which encourages high fees.
Also, it's clear that exchanges and users are supportive of block size increases, or some other means of processing more transactions.  But with POW, it's the miners that have the big stick b/c hash power is what secures the network.   You can't force miners to convert. 
What really needs to happen is some sort of incentive where the miners benefit DIRECTLY from the increased number of transactions in the network.  When the economic incentives for all 3 parties are aligned, governance will be much easier.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:03:49
So clarify your stance.  Why don't the nodes just act and let the mining community follow? After all, the miners would never spend time or money defending the current system.  If what you say were true, we would not be in this situation.

I agree with the first part of what you wrote. As the number of transactions in a block gets bigger, the miners do not benefit.  They are better off keeping blocks small and inducing higher fees. The question is, how to change this.
The big nodes, and users, want lots of transactions.  The big nodes make money in transaction fees to and from fiat. Miners don't. The number of nodes is a separate issue.

I know for sure that coinbase provides insurance. I think there are other exchanges in the USA that do also. 
Regarding borrowing, banks pool capital to make loans.  Sure crowdsourcing can effectively create loans too, but in that case you are often giving away company equity, which may or may not be desirable. I honestly don't understand your point about a deflationary economy. A bank can set loans at whatever rate they want, and can factor in any deflationary curency adjustments they want. Japan has struggled with deflation for years, yet their banks still make loans if the return on those loans is adequate.  If you foresee Bitcoin going up 20 percent per year, then you would not make a loan for less than that amount.  Fractional banking allows loan amounts that can far exceed the collateral amount. 
Perhaps I am misunderstanding your question. If your question is why do you want/need a bank to make a loan, it is because they can pool capital. Would you as a business owner rather have one loan, or 50 crowdsourced ones?
No one is saying you must use a bank, all we are saying is that there is a use case for Bitcoin banks.

Coinbase is among the most reputable exchanges out there.  They follow many banking rules and are insured. The answer to your question is it depends.
If the minority fork is short lived and has no value, they will list the majority fork only. There's no reason to support a dead fork.
If both forks have value, there are three scenarios.
1.  Coinbase will list both (like they did with etc and eth), 
2. they will sell the minorty fork and most likely compensate those on the majority fork with the gains .
3. give you private keys on the minority fork for your own use.  
If you want absolute control of both forked coins, or you think they are not reputable and will screw you, you should transfer your btc to a paper wallet.  This gives you the most flexibility and you won't be subject to Coinbases decisions on how this situation is handled.
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:57:12
Of course that was the intent.  But 2 years ago, the miners were fighting any scaling tooth and nail.  They were blocking even 2 mb blocks because they were insisting blocks must be full. Now they are ok with block size increases.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:26:34
No. Hardly anyone in the world knows or cares about it, and it's potential for disrupting the financial system, a massive addressable market, is undeniably real.   The price reflects the probability of successful use cases of Bitcoin.  We are no where near bubble territory. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:48:55
But the fees sit on top of the block reward, right?  And miners don't make money from bigger blocks. More transactions equals less congestion, which drives fees down. 
Last, getting 8% extra in fees is not chump change and is indeed an incentive for network congestion.
So in your model, what explains why the miners have been resisting bigger blocks for 2 years?
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:10:49
Sure, some people wanted to scale to meet demand in 2015, but others were concerned about how full the blocks were, and still others were concerned about the impact of  chinese firewalls, and others were worried about network attacks. Both sides are now proposing to scale, one through block size and one through block compression/off chain.

I think it's pretty clear that people are voting with their wallets.  ETH has been on fire.   As I said before, I own both ETH and BTC.   
Emotionally, my preference would be for Bitcoin to remain the gold standard of CC.  I have been tracking it for several years and finally invested in early 2015.  
Rationally, I don't see how BTC moves forward in it's current configuration.   How do you make the miners compromise when their economic incentives don't match those of users?   Mining has become an oligopoly - that is the fundamental problem.  They essentially collude to increase prices.  If mining was more distributed, the nodes would have the power and this issue would not exist.

Some good information here, but the conclusion makes no sense. The interest on assets held by the fed are already being remitted to the treasury, which lowers the public debt and the interest rate on all debts.

This is a great post and unfortunately few understand how the banking system actually works.  A couple points I would add:
1/ Bitcoin replaces the money creation and payment aspects of the current banking system. 
2/ bitcoin will have an imputed interest rate once it matures. With no ultimate supply increases allowed, demand for new bitcoin will be met by an increase in its value. This makes it perhaps the first money-like asset in history with theoretically (assume the network works in perpetuity) perfect store of value properties.  It cannot be devalued.
I see bitcoin operating in parallel to the traditional banking system - each system with its own advantages.

I am not a bit believer in technical analysis (I definitely focus more on fundamentals), but this blog makes a really good point.   It's hard, if not impossible, to predict bubble patterns from a  chart.   Look hard enough, and you will find every conceivable pattern across a variety of assets.   Just because something is going up fast, does not mean it's in a bubble. 
I'm personally a bit sick of all the bubble talk.   Ever since dot come, EVERYTHING has been/ or is in a bubble.  Stocks (Shiller PE anyone), bonds (historic low rates for how long), real estate (financial crisis), commodities (Oil bubble).    Bubble is just a buzzword for FUD.

Sometimes I feel like I could give a better answer. So here it is:
A bitcoin monetary system, operating parallel to the USD, would allow underbanked and unbanked people to preserve wealth and encourage saving. For example, if inflation runs at 2%, and the banks pay .01% in interest, people loose money by storing wealth in banks. In bitcoin monetary system, because the supply is capped, increased demand for money is met with an increased price, thereby imputing an interest rate while its being held. 
In addition, a bitcoin monetary system provides a check on central bank power. If the power to print fiat money were abused, then a bitcoin-based alternative system would shield everyday people from such abuses, allowing them to maintain purchasing power in spite of central bank irresponsibly.

@_date: 2017-05-24 20:26:27
My understanding is that GBTC, as an investment trust, has a fixed supply of bitcoin. If someone wants to buy, and there are no sellers at the net asset value of the fund, then you must bid up the price until someone is willing to sell.  Thus, what is happening is that  many people are willing to pay more more than the net asset value of the bitcoins, for the right to own some fraction of the underlying assets. 
This is why an etf would be huge. In an etf, the fund would add and sell Bitcoin to match the money flows in and out of the fund. 
As was noted elsewhere in this thread, the share value of gbtc  was pegged originally to .1 of a Bitcoin. 
This link explains it.
Hope this helps.

There is absolutely merit in what you say - but I think what your presenting here is a bit of a false choice.  
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:38:43
LOL- thanks Andreas! Yes it's a feature that the blocksize debate has lasted 2.5 years.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:02:29
They are both leaders, and someone had to step up.  I'm glad someone did.  As a user and investor in Bitcoin, I still say thank you Barry.  (I still have a man crush on Andreas.  One of the most articulate speakers ever)
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:46:33
You are a classy guy
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:28:48
I agree with this. But at some point, core needs to rally itself and speak with one voice,  even if some within it disagree. Otherwise, we will see more deals like this where core has no seat at the table. There are lots of interests at play here, we need a strong core leader (or leaders) to represent the group.  This idea that everyone is a chief and there are no Indians does not work.  Miners can't negotiate independently with each of 1000 developers.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:17:12
?  Segwit gets implemented.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:46:37
The problem is that the miners don't trust core. And "core" as an entity, if you call it that, lacks leadership (Gavin situation anyone).  Core can't even agree with core. It was a smart move to leave them out.  They got an agreement for Segwit adoption, which is what core was promoting.  So, I largely agree with you.  
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:44:57
Yes segwit works.  But, think of it this way, the miners are only gaining advantage over other miners. If every miner was running the boost, there would be no advantage.  Pretty much antpool/asic manufacturer are screwing the other miners. 
Trust between core and the chinese miners is non existent for both cultural reasons and the percieved backing out of the deal last year.
You may be aware of this, but there are two types of asic boosts. When you reference them, might be good to be clear which one you are referring to.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:27:33
Growth. When your grandma and the random guys at the water cooler at work start buying, that's when the bubble discussion starts.  What's going on now is LEGIT speculation as to what the currency can become. The price increase reflects the probability of success and the potential market penetration.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:14:36
The Barry agreement is really nothing new. This agreement could have been reached a year ago if someone would have stepped forward to broker a deal. This took way to long, and now we have to wait even longer to scale which has been needed for quite some time.  The scaling  problems are not technological, they are are political. 
The false choice comment was in reference to the fact that it shouldn't have taken this long to produce a technically competent solution.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:51:33
Who cares about asicboost as long as bitcoin can scale.  Asicboost is an issue of competitiveness among miners.   If your concerned about the mining pools becoming too centralized, then address that issue directly.  Asicboost is not the issue. The issue is that one company makes all the damn chips. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:24:41
I agree with you.  But, I am hoping that he eventually sees he'd rather go down in history as George Washington rather than George Will. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:55:53
I know, but why do you care about asicboost?  I care about scaling.
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:44:38
|Sure you do -- it'll make you famous.
Really? You think some hacker in his garage is going to solve this? Your missing the point.  This is not about technological problems, this is a political problem.  Even Republicans and Democrats can agree to fund the government for the greater good.   Lack of leadership IS the problem.  Best case scenario is that someone emerges who can help this community to reach consensus.  And it's more likely to be "talking head" than a developer.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:07:21
Don't you want bitcoin to be successful?  Of course at some point people have to be pragmatic.  We don't need a bunch of babies running what will be a trillion dollar currency someday.  We need people who can negotiate and build consensus.  I want bitcoin to reach its potential, and mass adoption will not happen without compromise. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:25:42
I've seen the video.  Yes, Bitcoin is out at sea, but it's problem is not the ocean, it's that the ship is ill equipped, rudderless, and without any leadership.  The crew can't come together and address changes.   Worse yet, the crew are all staking out there own claims and pitting their solutions against one another.   The shiney ships in the harbor with actual leadership and crew look much more attractive.  My point is, this infighting is hurting bitcoin's potential.   
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:42:51
Just to clarify, we the CODE for segwit, and I've heard the code changes for 2MB blocks is simple.  Are you saying that the BIPs for 2MB blocks proposed 2 years ago have never been tested?
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:27:53
This makes  no sense.  There is only 1 mining pool "scamming" the system using a back door Asicboost.  It's all the other miners the LOSE in this situation.  The mining community would be complete fools to block segwit due to Asicboost.  
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:54:22
Incredibly lame and short sighted that someone would down-vote a post thanking someone who is trying to broker a compromise.  
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:23:07
It's hard to find credible people saying 2 MB blocks won't work.  Almost everyone says the network can handle them.  That's not the issue from what I have read.  The issue is that some think on-chain scaling is a dead end and won't accomplish much.
I support Segwit.  I can live with 2 MB blocks.  It's more important at this juncture to put together a roadmap so developers know what the heck they are developing on.  It's also CRITICAL that all the new users coming on line see that this thing called bitcoin actually works (and don't get transactions stuck in never never land).
I don't see anything that says why these solutions can't move and be implemented ASAP - thus my question.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:51:28
Comments like this are the reason we have been stuck for 2.5 years.  Bitcoin has real money at stake.  Barry was trying to break the stalemate.  Give him credit. The users win from this compromise.  
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:57:07
I think your comments speak for themselves
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:20:16
You don't think the run up was partly due to market knowledge of the impending compromise?  This has been in the works for months...
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:04:00
I've been invested in bitcoin since 2015, and tracked it from about 2013.  I understand the fear/paranoia in bitcoin regarding leadership.   
I think people are mistaking the term "leader" as meaning "CEO."   I am not advocating for a CEO of bitcoin.   A leader in an organization is not always an executive either.  It's someone who can build consensus and solve problems that often cannot be hacked by individual contributors. 
Whether people like it or not, or acknowledge it or not, or whether Andreas is even comfortable with the being seen as one, he is a leader by virtue of his talents to explain bitcoin to the masses.   In terms of scaling debate, his involvement is important because:
1) He has the BIG voice and following in bitcoin
2) He understands the technical details
3) He can articulate both political positions and technical challenges in a way nearly everyone can understand.   (he could teach a monkey rocket science)
I still contend he is the right man to build censuses around a scaling solution.  The problem is NOT technical, it's political. 
Andreas is politically savvy enough to know how to navigate this mess of egos and economic incentives, and he has credibility to so that people will listen to what he has to say.
Someone needs to mediate this mess, and I nominate Andreas.

Lots to respond to here. I share your frustration. Bottom line is that fiat, and the fractional banking system won't work without inflation. There needs to be some as 90 percent of the money issues is debt. That said, Bitcoin has lot potential to be power money- essentially central bank m0 currency, without the central bank.  And, anyone can own it. That's where the value lies.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:46:28
Not sure I follow.  Segwit is getting activated = non issue
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:55:53
Great post. I agree with almost everything here.  Lack of trust between parties, the down voting tolls, etc.. have continued to cast a shadow on what should be an exciting, prosperous time for the leading blockchain and crypto currency in the world.  We need to move forward - even if the solution isn't perfect. There are too many challenges ahead for Bitcoin.  It should not be bitcoin advocate versus bitcoin advocate, it should be bitcoin advocate against the established monetary system.   Even the VCs want to disrupt the monetary system. At the end of the day, we are all on the same team.  You would never know it by the tone of this board sometimes.
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:07:43
Building consensus is leadership.  When they get into a room to discuss scaling, someone is leading the conversation...
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:20:52
I will respectfully disagree.  Leaders are absolutely mediators, and to suggest otherwise is to not appreciate/understand how modern management works or how leadership is exercised in flat organizations (think academics, doctors, etc..).  In fact, in my organization, mediation and consensus building is THE most important part of management.   What you are referring to, follow/listen/do is leadership  for a completely different organizational structure.  Obviously, that type of leadership would never fly in bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:16:48
I agree with much of what you wrote here.  Where we disagree is I want to get Bitcoin to scale ASAP. The boost issue can be addressed as part of a separate BIP proposal.  Flush it out that way - it's  far easier and will obviously confirm who is cheating.
You want to address it now as part of a UASF. I'd be fine with that too, but I don't believe it will happen and this Barry  plan is the next best thing.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:15:59
How exactly is bringing together all of the major investors, exchanges, and miners to form a compromise THE PROBLEM.  Bitcoin has a lot of problems, and the main one is a COMPLETE LACK OF TRUST AND DIALOG.   Consensus is what moves us forward, not one-sided soft forks.
