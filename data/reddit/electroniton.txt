I think you're fine doing what you did.  If he didn't want anyone to know, he would have run it through shapeshift into XMR and then the trail ends.  I'm curious too.  Don't delete your post.

Good to hear.  Trouble is, a newb would swear bitcoin off forever if this happened to them.  No?

Good points.  I guess any mitigation is better than nothing.  Thanks for the thoughts hanorb.

Thanks Fiach_Dubh.  I will start that.  Keeping my crypto private itself is not as big a concern because I expect to pay tax, and I've never exposed the public keys except to fill them. And I never use an address twice.  So I've done some things right.  But yeah I will go to work on your suggestion post haste!  
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:44:35
Well there's always that ;)
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:49:44
Thanks - will look at it.

NO IT IS NOT!  It's pseudo anonymous.  But that's a different topic entirely.  If a very bad actor notices you've been talking about bitcoin since 2009, and by using hundreds of your posts and deductive reasoning can determine you likely own thousands of bitcoin, which by now make you a multi millionaire, and you were stupid like me to use the same screen name in forums where you talk about saxophones and your job as a plumber, then he can possibly figure out where you live, and you are suddenly in danger of coercion and threats to turn over your private keys or else.

It absolutely does! It's because of bitcoin I have the concern.  Wanted to pose it to other Bitcoin enthusiasts, who perhaps have thought this through, and dealt with it.

Oh wow, I didn't even know that.  Just read about it.  Hopefully whoever buys it can do something good.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:36:54
Very good idea!  Thank you for it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:19:29
Awesome! :)

Definately clears it up further for me Frednn!  Thank you!

So as long as my  (extended) public key is never exposed or compromised, I can expose private keys to my heart's content, and never ever can anyone work backwards to determine a private key that I DID NOT expose?

Thanks jcoinner!
@_date: 2019-01-25 18:52:09
Great explanation. I understand now. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-01-15 16:48:11
Ah ha.  Thank you all!  I will read more about hardened derivation.  Yes I'm using the apostrophe '  But upon a closer look it only has the apostrophe on the first three.   So m/44'/0'/0'/0/0
