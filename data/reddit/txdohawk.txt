You are on a level of drugs where it finally makes sense to lay off that dank kush. Go look at a three-month chart, a mere footnote in economic history, and try to say that again with a straight face.


Something something "historical results" something something "future outcomes".
@_date: 2017-02-11 12:52:07
So why is this still a widespread problem? 
For one, I'd imagine we have more than enough historical data now where coders could back test potential solutions via seeing what their algorithm would've chosen for a fee vs. what fees at the time ensured reasonable confirmation speeds.
Two, I feel like there should be at least a reasonable semi-hacky formula, something like [fee based on current network analysis] + [extra n cents safety fudge calculated via stuff like recent price trend, recent trend in transaction volume, etc.]
Despite a lot of dum-dums here claiming things like "I'm not going to pay an extra ten cents just to quickly confirm my three hundred dollar transaction I need to use right away!", I'd imagine most actual users of Bitcoin wouldn't give a shit about reasonable amounts of "overspending" if it meant they could reliably avoid getting stuck in confirmation hell.

He seems to think that Bitcoin is doomed. I do find this a bit dramatic, even if I am pro-increase.
I think like many other problems, the pain of its existence will provide motivation for the solution. If transaction fees and confirmation times continue to get worse, we will see more demand for quick resolution.

Everybody's like "who's going to teach these people how to use Bitcoin?" Nobody's going to have to. 
All you need is a dude in the US willing to exchange USD -&gt; BTC and a dude in Mexico willing to exchange BTC -&gt; Peso. They could probably each charge a 10% cut and still have never ending demand in this scenario, given how desperate these people are.

Looks like his current profession is engineering for NCR, so to be fair, he's got a front-row view as to what a worthless product looks like. I fix their POS systems for a large company that uses them and they are *atrocious*.

Here's hoping. Question though: It sounds like you were literally just trading cash for coin with no real escrow involved. Is that actually the case? Sounds pretty risky.
@_date: 2015-08-26 02:30:07
OP: "I'm mad as fuck because a platform I've been using for years for my own personal gain had the audacity to want compensation for the time and money spent building it. Can you believe this shit??"
This bullshit about "Watering it down to dodging a % is intellectually dishonest" is in fact, intellectually dishonest. You are simply using an unrelated argument re: security of the platform to justify the idea that you shouldn't have to pay for the existence of a platform that you *obviously* benefit from.
If you didn't, in fact, massively benefit from the service LBC provides, then you wouldn't have made this post. You'd go post ads on Craigslist, or put flyers around town, or hop to a competitor, or do one of any number of things that would allow you to freely trade bitcoins with users sans escrow. But you're not doing that, are you? 
Nobody wants to work for free, OP. You don't sell your BTC for a 0% profit, and LBC didn't spend time and money building a platform so some cheapskate could sneak around their profit model, regardless of what mental gymnastics they do to morally justify their behavior.

As a NJ resident who has considered selling before, this is intriguing. Wonder if this will bump demand in adjacent states.

That sounds pretty great, but I guess not so much anymore, since I'm assuming they no longer due this for fear of felonies.

Former Lyft driver here. I would have no problem doing this, it's kind of brilliant actually. That said, I would put **100% OPTIONAL** in large, bold letters just to make it obvious tips aren't expected.
As for the large body of users on here who are screaming I DON'T WANNA TIP, that's fine, don't tip! But ridesharing is a lousy job that is only getting worse thanks to these companies squeezing the drivers with increased fare fees. Car wear and tear eats up a huge portion of profit.
Is that your problem? No, not at all. But if a driver goes out of their way to make your drive a pleasant one, throw an extra buck or two at 'em if you're feeling flush. We're human beings after all, and kindness is in short supply in these service industry jobs.
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:11:23
100% agree with you. However, as you've seen in this post, some people really, really don't like the idea of being nudged into a tip. The platform holders of these services also frown upon anything that can be remotely construed as an expectation of tipping. So, it's just a good idea for the driver to make that extra, extra clear, for their own sake.
@_date: 2015-07-23 15:06:26
I do not support giving riders ratings based on tips. When I drove, riders got a 5 unless they did something obnoxious (aggressive behavior, arguing about prices, complaining about route taken without suggesting their own, etc.)
That is what the system is designed for, so that drivers can identify and avoid problem passengers. "Not tipping" is a lousy excuse to rate a passenger low, and puts bad data into a good system.

BTCJam is a great platform...for borrowers, since it seems they can default with zero consequences.
I myself have a loan I took on there, but I did a small amount of lending before that and wasn't impressed by the default rate, even after carefully choosing what to fund.
The problem mainly seems to be that word is spreading that the laughable "arbitration" process is completely toothless, which spurred even more defaults.
I plan on paying back my loan, as I'm not a scumbag...but to be perfectly honest: If I lost my job tomorrow in some apocalyptic scenario and had to start making choices about what creditors to pay, BTCJam would be the least of my worries, by far. That should scare investors, and it should scare you. Avoid.

"Zoom out, get a little perspective!"
I'm sure somebody said this to all the people who bought near the top in late 2013, too.
I'm bullish, but I also think we're about due for another expensive lesson in why stop losses exist.

Basically, because having the justification to use the term “Bitcoin” to describe your version is immensely valuable from an optics and branding standpoint. It’s the first word people think of in crypto. Kind of like how every adhesive bandage is called a Band-Aid.

That'd be about $100k USD, at that point I'd definitely be cashed out. $70k would go toward eliminating every cent of debt I have at the moment, the other $30k mostly stowed away. I'd then trade in my car and kick in some cash for a down payment on a new car, probably.

I actually had a couple of co-workers ask ME about Bitcoin, completely unprompted. I was pretty happy. Of course, their question was about how to get in on the money-making aspect...to which I informed them, much to their dismay, that the gold rush is largely over from a mining standpoint.

But I get it, I'm sure whatever crypto you back is going to cover everything in the future, because it's perfect and glorious. I'm sure there were people who thought the Model T was the be all and end all in horse-replacement, too. Prepare to feel about as dumb in a decade from now.

Does the iOS version support hardware wallets, with something like the Lightning to USB adapter?
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:35:15
If the device breaks and or stops being supported, you should always be able to import your backup passphrase into another wallet (even a software one) that supports their backup implementation (my understanding is that the Trezor and Keepkey implementations are very standard.)
This is very important. Store your backup phrase offline and keep it very, very safe, because not only is it your lifeline if your device gets lost, breaks, or otherwise stops working...anyone who gets your backup phrase can import it and steal all your coins.

In a world where you believe one cryptocurrency has all the answers and all the others are steaming piles of garbage with nothing of value, wanting full marketshare dominance is logical, I get it. Some of us are a little brighter than that, though.
There isn't one car company, corporation, government, credit card company, etc. for reasons I don't have to explain, even to a pea-brain like you.
If you understand that, and yet think there's going to be one cryptocurrency in the future that handles everything...well, I don't know what to tell you. Except...maybe you should keep your mouth shut when the adults are talking. :)

Sidechains put the people building off them at the mercy of the crypto they are chaining off, for better or worse.  If the cryptocurrency you chain off of implodes, or changes their mind on stuff like two-way pegs, too bad, so sad!
Again, you are fantasizing about a world where everyone bows a knee to one dominant cryptocurrency and nobody thinks "Fuck this, I could do better." 
Guess what? Many people are going to want to build that dominant cryptocurrency, because that dominant cryptocurrency is going to attract things like these chains, and that will pump the value and power of the host crypto immensely. You see?  Trogg like money! Trogg like power! Trogg build better wheel, fuck Grogg's wheel! Unga bunga! Does the caveman speak help? I don't know why this is such an impossible concept for you to visualize, but while we are making Google suggestions, maybe you can track down a Business and Competition 101 refresher.
Okay, I'm done. That's all I have to say on this. If you really are so dull in your skull that such a scenario can't possibly exist in your mind and all you can see is One True Glorious Blockchain, I give up. This is like trying to sharpen a butter knife with a quilted blanket.
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:06:30
Think of it this way. A "Bitcoin wallet that you control" is literally like a wallet you keep in your pocket stuffed with dollar bills. You own it, you control it, and no one can stop you from taking the money out.
Putting your money in an exchange or web wallet on the other hand is like putting that money in a bank. You have a claim to that money, but you have to trust the institution to ensure you will have access to that money. 
With banks it's (usually) fine. Banks have FDIC insurance and are (usually) reliable. But there's no insurance or protetction in the Bitcoin world. If somebody cracks open an exchange and steals their stash, you probably are boned. 
That said, keeping your own wallet presents its own dangers. Just like you can be robbed carrying around a wallet full of cash, using your own wallet means protection is your responsibility. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 20:23:17


Your theory passes in a world where everyone likes everything that the dominant cryptocurrency does in regards to scaling, implementation, control, immutability, etc., or at least likes it enough that it isn't considered economical to launch competitors.
This is the real world, though. We have two large, separate Bitcoin subs because of arguments about the future of scaling BTC. We now have Etherium Classic, because of the debate going on re: blockchain immutability. Large financial firms are going to want their piece of the pie as crypto/blockchain tech begins to permeate the landscape, and they'll have their own opinions on how a cryptocurrency should function.
This is not going to be an industry where everybody rolls over and bows to the leader. Too many financial and power-related incentives to controlling a cryptocurrency, too many potential points of disagreement on how a cryptocurrency could/should function, and low cost of entry for new competitors.

@_date: 2016-07-23 14:26:25
Positioning of the two cryptos as mortal enemies is dumb, and really reeks of the smelly Reddit "true believer" mentality that has poisoned way too many subs. 
Bitcoin is established and does what it does very well. Etherium is obviously very experimental at this point, and carries a lot of potential but a lot more risk. 
The market can easily support both, especially now that we see BTC being used large-scale as a hedge against currency controls / non-correlating asset (a use case in which the stability of the platform is preferred).

The real threat at the end of the day is bad actors. 
 - Someone would have to do a lot of covert work to sneak something undetected into the Trezor firmware.
 - Trezor has a large financial incentive to ensure this never happens (since their entire sales premise is on security).
 - That's not to say, of course, that it won't ever happen.
As others have hinted, if this is a concern to you, I'd use a simpler solution like cold storage or a paper wallet created on an air-gapped system. Of course, just remember the same issue applies...you have to trust the cold storage, you have to trust whatever generates the paper wallet and your system for storing it + copies, etc. 
Hardware wallets are great, I own a KeepKey myself, but use the system that lets you sleep comfortably at night. Only you can decide what that is.
