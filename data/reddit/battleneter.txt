Nearly all miners will currently and technically be running at loss, the small and large operations staying will playing the longer game and banking on a price rebound. We are 100% now below the floor but that does not mean they will all close shop.
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:28:20
I think you are confusing your paranoia with how a market actually works, I don't see any tangible manipulation. We might have a bear market for awhile, but so what, I just seeing buying opportunities. General Interest in Crypto has clearly dropped off in the last few months, but again not a problem in the short term!
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:26:42
Small investors are clearly the major cause of the movements, everyone needs to stop regurgitating the same BS about whales.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:19:42
You are putting too much belief into this weeks "insert reason here" excuse for a large drop. Its VERY clear general mainstream interest in Crypto has dropped steadily in the last few months and this has had far more of an impact than small percentage of ex Mt Gox coins hitting the market. All I see is a buying opportunity,but lets not BS ourselves.
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:38:41
I am sure many have done "Guesstimates" timelines, if you follow the last few months trend GPU mining will be over for most inside 3-5 months that's easy to calculate at 20% drop per month, but I don't believe its quite that bad. I am of course not talking about BTC mining, can't do that on GPU's any morel
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:46:52
nice like to a garbage post!
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:53:42
Mining profits have slipped over 40% in the last 8 weeks not so much due to Crypto prices going down, mostly due to mining difficulty increasing and also the ALT coin vs BTC price. I would do your homework and understand the mining return today which is a tad mediocre may be half two months from now. Most GPU' are already over one year return on investment which is usually seen as high risk due to the volatility of crypto, but as I say its getting worse so one year might turn to two years soon.
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:45:48
The GPU supply/price issue is mostly a North American problem (strangely). In a small city in NZ I can go down to a local computer store now and buy a 1080 for NZ$1020 or about US$650 after removing the sales tax.I have seen multiple retailers run and out re-stock over the last few months no real issues. And FYI mining is popular here also.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:56:59
While entirely true difficulty decreases as mining rigs get turned off its not even close to countering the drop in current crypto value. Even the cheapest electricity areas in the United States are now "technically" unprofitable to mine in if you sell what you mine each day. Most countries in Europe were unprofitable months ago. Its possible the largest mining operation in Iceland for example are still profitable due to super cheap electricity, but their commercial electricity rates are not published and I would be speculating.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:38:31
good work, the way not to panic.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:23:34
I believe there is strong support around 7.5 from long term holders, if dips under that it wont be for long at all.
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:40:17
Man people just make random shit up, what are you basing this garbage on anything at all?
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:18:35
Just relax and hold I have zero doubt you will see 18K again, but sure may take a year.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:55:59
Unless you purchased at 10K you haven't "lost" anything, the current profit you would make today would be less than a few days ago if you cashed out. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:39:49
Wow a link to a mediocre Reddit blog thanks!
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:03:30
jim7099, Just to be clear most of Crypto is pure gambling, people timing a exit before you and leaving you holding the can is not a weak hand, its entirely the opposite. Many of these people will buy back in when they feel the bottom is reached and they will make a profit. You need to be more mature in your understanding of Crypto and pay less attention to the BS excuses around "why bitcoin crashed".
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:31:41
Bcash is just 1 of 1500+ ALT coins.
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:47:19
yes that's the theory being regurgitated over and over in Reddit posts. 
If you read it enough it must be true ah !
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:17:12
I am seeing HUGE buy walls, looks like bargain hunters stepping in now!
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:12:32
15K buy the end of the day!
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:27:06
This is just BULLSHIT, the drop has nothing to do with the G20 lol, sick of blogs linking random garbage to explain price movements.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:38:11
its nothing like 1% own BTC, stop repeating crap you read in a blog somewhere.
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:56:52
Its unprofessional and could expose them to a legal challenge making that kind of post, not impressed.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:11:23
Yep 16K tomorrow!
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:43:20
Most of us here are only using some spare money and not mortgaging our houses!. You can easily loose $5K in the first year of buying a new car, its worth keeping some perspective.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:04:27
What a load of drivel, not everyone is living pay cheque to pay cheque lol, and they certainly shouldn't be trading crypto if things are that bad!
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:31:24
I am going to buy in at 19K when its nice and safe!
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:27:32
Looking at the Nasdaq bubble and then crash, it took just under 1.5 years for the cycle to complete, and 15 years to get past its bubble high.
Crypto seems to move at about 4x the speed with its bubble-crash happening in only 3 month ish.  1-5 years of trading sideways seems very possible, however even at 5 years buying in now and holding is still likely a excellent return, and I think my outlook could be seen as un-optimistic.
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:03:12
If the Dow Jones (share market) goes up 10%+ over an entire year, its  considered a VERY good year. Try and keep some perspective, its not about short term trends.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:29:06
Although its a dead cat bounce, it pays to remember Crypto appears to move significantly faster than the Dow or Nadaq. Three years to reach the same heights again in other markets is probably 1 year here. It may sound like fluff, but its also accurate.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:53:19
yawn, the entire market is still significantly up form 6 weeks ago. Don't expect 20% gain every day and worry about short term trends, you need to understand you are here for years!
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:42:39
ok lets cover the basics
- By low sell high
And that's the end of the lesson............ oh no wait, forgot to mention this is the low part!
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:00:59
Just relax, markets go up and down, most believe including myself the market will get a lot stronger this year, day to day trends don't matter unless your a day trader.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:16:58
I use Independent Reserve an Aussie outfit, can buy/sell in $NZ and $AU 
Current market buy NZ$14283 and sell NZ$13653, best option for NZ imo.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:09:52
A lot more ALT coins are staying in the green even when BTC is red, shows some general market confidence returning. Weeks ago when BTC was red everything just plunged into the red near instantly.
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:35:11
I think its highly likely far less people will be buying into mining or expanding in the next few months at least, mining has been declining fast due to difficulty rates and ATL coin vs BTC price,  more than the actual price of BTC itself which is basically the  3rd downward pressure.
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:26:57
The answer is simple, don't buy what you are not prepared to loose. I believe BTC is likely to build over this year, but don't get greedy :P
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:09:22
For fack sakes, this has nothing to do with the bloody G20 meeting lol
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:38:45
Basically at the moment when mining is less profitable due to power costs than straight out buying the coins directly is the point where its smart to turn off your mining rig just buy coins. Countries in Europe with high electricity prices will be the first to go.
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:03:42
I half agree, I was very much around for the Dot.com crash and remember it well AND yes seen this before as well. Its worth remembering the Nadaq is now significantly higher than the 2000 bubble peak. Sure it took over a decade to exceed that however Crypto appears to move "significantly" faster. If you assumed 5 years for BTC to pass 20K, that's still pretty nice for anyone on this ride longer term, and that's probably a fairly negative outlook.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:34:17
yea so time to buy ALT coins
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:29:56
A market trading within a range for a few months is nothing unusual, its completely normal over a few days or weeks.
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:58:40
I am not sure what you are talking about with get rich quick, but I do see a market that has "significantly" out performed the Dow in the last several years even after the recent correction, higher risks but higher returns.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:32:49
yea, crypto moves in both directions much faster than other markets like the Dow or Nasdaq. Most believe crypto will go far higher in the years to come, that's all that actually matters because its people that decide the value nothing else.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:43:30
Not sure why anyone would sell at 11K, the next correction zone is very likely between 13-15K and that's likely to be short lived.
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:56:02
lol its not crashing, its called profit taking. Pre-set auto sell orders just under 10k.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:23:18
chazzming, you just described a normal market, lol
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:48:26
WOW This random guy must be right lol

Its Friday here, Casual 400K Fridays.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:52:30
Investing is not a charity, people are here to make money. Not sure who these "Whales" you speak of are, plenty of small investors purchased high and then panic sold.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:28:41
Yawn, just some profit taking, few panicking alt coins however.
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:43:18
Well I have 4,000,000 BTC, and I think your full of shit, as I have more BTC I am obviously right for no other reason :)
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:17:06
Its not impossible, more likely to stay around 10K. This is a different situation from when it was threatening 20K,
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:19:36
Just relax just a little profit taking.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:16:50
Nem just went to 0, apparently its a scam coin!
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:49:03
People seem to need a "Insert reason here" for a market movement, the reality Crypto is 70% gambling and 30% investing. Gamblers are not betting crypto atm.....................that's entirely it. Will they next month again, yea maybe sure!
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:31:56
Pretty obvious there will be profit taking before 10K, however the fact its being tested again is encouraging. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:42:32
nice nice, I hate money, seemed like a good way to offload it :P
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:03:00
Its lucky this kind of thing NEVER happens in the share market..........................................oh wait :P
