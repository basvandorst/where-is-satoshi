I really don't know why I wrote "wallet mechanics". That's not was I was asking for, I meant anything that would explain BIPs simply or any reading material about anything specifically interesting about Bitcoin in general.

I would appreciate being pointed to anything useful I can read about bitcoin wallet mechanics in general. Happy independence day!

Ok, got it. I have another question that is most likely also nonsensical in some way but I'm gonna ask it anyway.
When crafting a transaction, can you add multiple outputs locked for different addresses (send to multiple addresses in 1 transaction)? Or is that not a thing? 
I have these questions as I read what I can find online which is why they're bad. Not that it matters.

That's an incredibly small amount to pay for a drink
@_date: 2019-03-24 14:26:14
Care to elaborate? What's your setup? How much does it cost?

What are the specifics of pruning? Don't I still need to install the full blockchain before I set Bitcoind to run in pruned mode or can I bypass that full sync from the get go? Also will lnd work with a pruned node?

That sounds really cool, let us know how that goes man

Blockstream has a repo for an "out of the box" HTTP api on top of electrs which is what I thought about using   [

How much lower are the fees for native SegWit?

The neutered thing is something I saw in a bip32 library. I'm trying to understand bip44 so I can implement it for my wallet (personal, not commercial). I come from an Ethereum development background so the whole utxo thing was confusing for a while.
@_date: 2019-10-10 02:32:09
Oh right ok so for whatever utxos I use as inputs, I can just Regen the data I need cuz it's deterministic that's awesome
@_date: 2019-08-04 07:31:45
Oh wow
@_date: 2019-10-10 04:28:42
Thanks so much. Very helpful

That's the only issue I have. There's no way for the server to distinguish the actual shareholder from someone who is impersonating the shareholder.
The more I look into it, the more SSS seems like extra steps instead of an actual solution. Device encryption might be the move here I guess

I think BECH32 uses BIP173 actually
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:02:43
Oh wow. Trezor did this? Well that validates it well haha. Thanks for the link, I'll go through it thoroughly.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:27:07
Anyone have an answer using bitcoinjs-lib and a BECH32 library? I just want to understand how the wallet creation process is different from prior BIPs

At no point did it hit 5k. Top was $4,841.44 on Binance.
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:47:33
Wow, my bad then. The harder it rises, the harder it'll correct
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:59:54
Yeah honestly dude looks fine to me.

Gotta pay for the DLC my guy
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:57:38
I meant services like CoinText. How do they work?
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:59:37
That's fair ahaha. There's a wallet that does what they're doing but with Bitcoin instead. I just want to know what's actually going on behind the scenes there.
