$10? Thats ridiculous 
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:11:27
Changetip is responsible for bitcoin at 420, well probably higher(no pun intended), but after that crazy drop from like 700-300 I'm kind of glad.

The only thing I've ever bought besides funds used to gamble with, were WoW CD keys. Have a very reliable site also if anyones interested.

Thanks. I signed up for circle, but it appears to be stuck on some type of verification. I have documentation available for them, but Idk. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:37:22

Whats going on man?

Made it seem easy lol
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:41:42
I will admit, when it dropped to $350 from $600+ I was kinda skeptical.. I think that changetip was a good move. Just the right amount of promotion
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:55:19
What about murlocs

As said before, tips bring in newcomers, but its bitcoin itself which keeps those newcomers. Bitcoin is the closest alternative to 'throwing change around' because unlike other vcurrencies, you can send a few cents with ease AND ACTUALLY USE THE CENTS without paying crazy fees. I also think that the 0% fee deposits until jan 2015 with changetip is also keeping newcomers interested. So tipping + btc + gambling sites - can't lose. We just have to hope it doesn't crash after the tipping hype is over with -_-
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:42:08
Damn. Always late smh
@_date: 2014-11-08 17:44:15
