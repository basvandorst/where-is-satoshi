Not all arguments have two balanced sides, where the evidence for each position is opposed by an equally valid counter-argument. 
If you (and I mean the rhetorical "you") believe that the only reason for cryptocurrency to exist is censorship resistance, then you will understand that a "global-scale microtransaction system" comes last in the list of priorities. 
If you disagree and believe that cryptocurrency has a reason to exist outside of censorship resistance, then we're not merely disagreeing on a philosophical point. We have a fundamentally different understanding of the technology, and our camps belong in a different subset of computer science.
That's really the divide here. I believe that a cryptocurrency that sacrifices censorship resistance for convenience is basically Paypal 1.0, let alone 2.0.

The greater risk is from the centralizing effects that come with a reckless blocksize increase. The nightmare scenario from a centralized Bitcoin is what happened to Ethereum (the outcome of a valid transaction was reversed by a rule change brought about by a small minority of insiders). So far we've managed to avoid that through careful deliberation and by ignoring the Chicken Littles.

I believe the issue is something like this: a malicious miner could continuously fill up blocks with spam transactions with the goal of keeping its competitors busy downloading and validating those blocks while the bad miner gets a head start on finding the next block. This could then lead to the attacker achieving and maintaining dominance as it starves the other miners. Or perhaps every miner responds by filling blocks as a defensive measure, and we have a big problem on our hands.
A 1MB max block size might not be large enough for that attack to make a difference, but 8MB might be plenty.

All distributed consensus algorithms in systems that strive for maximal decentralization will eventually incur an energy cost that roughly matches the value of the block reward+fees. PoS schemes require remediations to patch around their inherent deficiencies ("nothing at stake" being the classic one), and eventually it becomes PoW by another name, but more fragile due its increased complexity.
@_date: 2015-06-05 16:20:25
OP is claiming that Bitcoin is wasteful of energy, which betrays a naive understanding of Bitcoin and its distributed consensus system. Bitcoin's distributed consensus system requires that miners must prove that they've incurred a cost before they're eligible to publish the next block. This cost will naturally rise with the value of the block reward+fees due to competitive forces. OP would know this if he had been "evangelizing bitcoin for 5 years".
And no, PoS isn't the solution, because it's subjected to the same economic forces. Eventually the work required to secure a block in a PoS scheme will rise to match that of a PoW scheme with equal security.

Vertcoin adapts its scrypt parameters to try and dodge ASICs. That's not necessarily "superior" - it's just a preference for GPU miners. It also keeps the coin vulnerable to botnets, unlike Bitcoin.


This is *far* from settled and is in fact highly controversial. 


Bitcoin's distribution isn't a problem, and it is evening out over time. Dogecoin and Litecoin have similar distribution curves.


That remains to be seen. The next bitcoin release will have an adaptive fee system that is expected to significantly lower fees.


All coins are "sustainable" given a large enough network and financial incentive to keep it running. A cryptocurrency isn't some static thing - it can change over time.

Bitcoins are divisible to 8 decimal places. The smallest unit is 0.00000001 BTC, which is called a "satoshi". Over 1.2 *quadrillion* satoshis have been issued so far by the network, and the protocol limits the total number to 2.1 quadrillion. Each new block mined releases 2,500,000,000 satoshis (25 Bitcoins). 
With that many units to go around, it seems unlikely that we will run out any time soon. Even still, the Bitcoin community might agree sometime in the distant future to make Bitcoin even more divisible, perhaps to 16 decimal places. That would increase the number of units available to trade without affecting the value of anyone's holdings.

The whole point of proof-of-work is to prove that you've incurred a certain cost to arrive at the solution for a given block. This proof can be verified mathematically. It's impossible to fake. Efficiency only matters in that it can confer a competitive advantage to some miners, but otherwise it's irrelevant.

This is highly debatable and far from settled. Most of the altcoins use different parameters for the number of units, the block rate and block reward, and it's not clear which ones are optimal. Different PoW functions or the use of proof-of-stake make no functional difference to the end user.
As we've seen today Bitcoin is under active development with dozens of talented programmers contributing to the core. It is the leading edge of development. You will see this as the altcoins rush to merge the latest upgrades into their code.

The fact that Mt. Gox allowed customer deposits to be stolen doesn't diminish the utility of Bitcoin as a distributed asset ledger or as a currency. Those stolen ledger units will eventually recirculate back into general use if they haven't already.

A side chain is basically an altcoin, but with a key difference: the ledger units can be pegged to some amount of Bitcoin. This means that the altcoin would essentially be using BTC instead of a different currency. That eliminates the currency exchange risk that one must incur when switching between altcoins, opening up all cryptocurrency innovations to bitcoin users.

So much uncertainty has fallen away. I remember when it was questionable if Bitcoin would even be allowed to exist. That question is still up in the air in places like China, but it's pretty clear that the USA will not ban it along with most other countries. Opinion was 50/50 split on that not too long ago. 
Now we have major Silicon Valley VCs and even non-tech VCs pumping money into various startups, exchanges, and trusts. That was a laughable dream 4 years ago, but here we are.

Bitcoin is a network and an application platform. Its value increases exponentially as each new user joins the system (see Metcalfe's Law). As the value rises, it attracts more and more applications and services because it provides the highest reward for the effort expended.

Vitalik Buterin provides a thorough analysis of Proof of Stake here:
 [
He describes the "nothing at stake" problem (it costs nothing for miners to simultaneously mine all competing chains), and some of the mitigating strategies. So far, all of the proposed PoS and hybrid PoW/PoS solutions rely on some form of centralization. 
PoW still remains the only known solution that can provide the highest level of decentralization (mining pools notwithstanding), although he remains open to the possibility that the challenges facing PoS may one day be overcome. In that case, PoS would be the way to go because of its obvious cost advantages.

For example, maybe he had to sell quickly for a good reason, some kind of circumstance that couldn't wait or at least that could't wait for the duration of a drawn out bear market. When a quick sale is the most important factor, a large limit order set appropriately low may be the only option.

There may be some early confusion, but it won't take long for anyone who transacts in bitcoin regularly to learn that 1 bit = 100 satoshi. The incentive to understand it is high - people care about their money.


The term "bit" for money has long since fallen out of common usage, but it was an everyday colloquialism a few generations ago:

The value of the remaining coins just goes up due to increased scarcity. The protocol allows for 2.1 *quadrillion* satoshis to exist (1 satoshi = 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin), so 30% of that still leaves 630 trillion satoshis available for trading, which ought be enough. But if it isn't, the Bitcoin community could potentially agree to make it even more divisible.

The Bitcoin system is growing, not deflating, as measured by metrics such as number of blockchain transactions, applications, users, and investment. The price of the units is falling, yes, but as of yet that hasn't affected the value of the system.
If a company has a requirement for a distributed decentralized ledger, then bitcoin is a good choice because it has the largest deployed base which means that it has the most number of people, businesses, and tools supporting it. This also means that it has the greatest security. 
A company that spins off its own decentralized ledger faces the risk that its uptake will be poor, giving it a low value and thus low security. There's not really any point to doing such a thing unless Bitcoin fails to meet a specific technical requirement.

- Massive and constant global media exposure
- regular meetup groups and conferences all over the world
- a fast growing number of vendors accepting it, currently numbered in the thousands
- a large community of talented developers contributing to the code base
- 50M+ investment from Sillicon Valley VCs into related companies
- hundreds of funded startups in stealth mode
- At least two investment trusts (one in Malta, one in New York)
- A (goddamn) ETF currently under review by the SEC, application being managed by the same lawyer who did the SPDR ETF
- Point of Sales solutions
and on and on.
All Dogecoin has is a large subreddit and an impressive PR stunt. They've done all the easy stuff - putting together websites, establishing a "foundation", etc. However, getting global recognition and acceptance is a long hard slog, and it's very hard to shortcut.

Well there was a push to use millibitcoins (1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC) and that got a little bit of traction. 1 mBTC is around 45 cents, so it's closer to the number of digits on the left side of the decimal that people are used to. 
The problem was that there was tepid support for the suggested monikers (millies, mBTC, millibits), and then there was the viewpoint that millibitcoins just isn't forward-looking enough due to anticipated price appreciation. 
Then there's the Dogecoin factor. It's clear that some newcomers to cryptocurrency are passing on Bitcoin because it's "too expensive". $1 only gets you 0.002222 BTC. Switching to millibitcoins doesn't help much because that's only 2.222 mBTC. However, $1 gets you 2222 DOGE! It's seems silly, but that kind of psychology could be acting as a drag on Bitcoin adoption.
Using microbitcoins addresses those issues. It anticipates massive price appreciation, it comes with a catchy moniker (bits) that most people don't despise (which is the best you can ask for  around these parts), and it evens the score with "cheap" altcoins by putting more digits on the left side of the decimal place.

Very reasonable, however I disagree with this:


People are attracted to Bitcoin for different reasons. I personally was attracted to its potential to be an alternative store of value, and I've been using it that way happily for three years. I'm certainly not alone there. 
In fact I've always seen the store-of-value as Bitcoin's real killer app, but of course I see the potential for the payments/remittances side of things as well and I hope that takes off in a big way. I don't see the two uses as being mutually exclusive.
So I think that ignoring the store of value feature in consideration of Bitcoin's valuation is a mistake, unless I'm not understanding you correctly.

There seems to be this perception that regulation means changing the Bitcoin protocol into something that isn't pseudonymous and decentralized. I've never worried about that because it doesn't make sense for the community at large to accept a gimpy Bitcoin. It will never happen, or if it does, that version of Bitcoin will be rejected and it will die.
Yes, we might have to deal with regulation were BTC meets fiat, but that's going to be impossible to avoid no matter what the cryptocurrency is. Governments will be all over that, guaranteed.  However, once you have Bitcoins, you'll always be free to use them as you please, which is why I feel that Bitcoin still remains an exciting and disruptive technology.

Some technologies are harder to replace than others, specifically platforms, so the comparison matters when making the replacement argument.
IPv4 remains dominant, despite the fact that the superior IPv6 has been available for about 20 years. Why? Because IPv4 has been good enough.

Why not both? Investment into infrastructure will have a positive effect on the price.

If the Bitcoin rules are broken in the interest of a minority of users, then trust in the blockchain will be broken. It opens the door to further reversals, which means you can no longer be certain that only you have control over your address balances.
Some misguided people might attempt to do what you're suggesting, which will cause a hard fork. I believe that Bitcoin-Bailout-Coin will be ignored by the larger community and it will fall in value to near-zero within a few months.
Unfortunately the media will have a field day with this schism, spinning it in the worst possible way as they like to do. The ensuing distrust of what was supposed to be an incorruptible blockchain will undermine faith in the concept of decentralized ledgers. Not fatally, but it will set us back.

I agree. The mining metaphor is a PR disaster, and is likely one the main reasons Bitcoin has received such vitriol over the years. It makes it sound like an arbitrary bullshitty way to create currency. 
It should just be described as bookkeeping or transaction processing that comes with a reward. The reward serves two functions: 1) incentivize workers to participate in processing and 2) serve as a fair way to distribute the 21M bitcoins. Had mining been described in that way I believe Bitcoin would have received far less hostility.

You can apply the "bad for the environment" or "waste of energy" accusation to any activity that doesn't happen to appeal to you.  
Far more carbon is pumped into the atmosphere by people playing MMOs worldwide (all the servers and client-side computers) than miners securing the Bitcoin ledger, yet I don't see any "bad for the environment" complaints about that. 
The energy spent on securing the Bitcoin ledger is the price we pay for having a decentralized transaction processing system/ledger that can't be easily commandeered (irrespective of the centralization threat the system is currently facing, which is a separate issue). Personally I think the goal of a global disintermediated store of value and transfer system is a laudable one that will be an overall benefit to humanity, and the energy expended is far from wasted.

Everyone upgrades their nodes to a new version of Core that features the new POW that would be possible to mine using GPUs.
The GPU miners out there currently mining altcoins would likely jump at the chance to mine Bitcoin, so there would be instant hash power. The SHA-256 ASIC miners would effectively be made irrelevant. 
A change like that would require a lot of planning and coordination and a lengthy timeline to be sure. It's also not fair to the "good" SHA-256 miners who would lose their hardware investments through no fault of their own. However, changing the POW remains a nuclear option in a worst case scenario.

Ask yourself if it would still be $1B (a crazy amount for something so unaccomplished, but I digress).

We don't - we **choose to install the node software voluntarily**. If I don't like the Core software, I have other choices such as btcd which is consensus-compatible with the Bitcoin protocol. Also the "Core devs" are a community of developers working on an open source project. 
That is the opposite of the BU approach, where they focus on two sentences in the white paper, misinterpret them (hash power can change consensus rules!!), and then create poorly-reviewed node software under the control of a semi-private organization that works under an Articles of Confederation.

Side chains and lightning are excellent things for Bitcoin, because they make it modular and help it to scale. And Lightning is pure bitcoin - it collapses mulpitple transactions into single on-chain transactions. A lightning channel is a transaction. It's basically a higher protocol layer on Bitcoin. It's a Good Thing.

 &gt; This is a slippery slope fallacy and a block size increase is not indicative of anything else happening other than a block size increase.
Although the *slippery slope fallacy* does indeed describe an error of deduction in formal logic, that doesn't mean that slippery slopes don't exist. It just means that in the strict sense you can't argue that A will *necessarily* lead to B without demonstrating a connection.
We know that slippery slopes are real - something starts off as a modest law and then ratchets up, through a series of steps, into something much broader in scope than originally envisioned. 
A trivial example is the progression of anti-smoking laws, which started off by banning smoking in the work place, which opened the door to banning smoking in public indoor areas, which opened the door to banning smoking in public outdoor areas. At each step along the way, the public's attitudes adjusted to the new normal, paving the way for the next step. [Not that I'm saying that's a bad thing in this particular example!]
A similar ratcheting effect is easy to envision for Bitcoin, given strong enough incentives by motivated groups such as governments, or by groups that want to gain some advantage by changing the consensus rules. Step one convinces the economic majority that *this small change*, requiring a hard fork, will provide some benefit, and the loss of a tiny amount of decentralization is worth it. Step two is...
That might seem paranoid, but the as I said, slippery slopes do exist, so it's something to be wary of considering what's at stake.

Ver isn't so concerned with fees; he sees the block size limit as being a drag on adoption. In the interview, he expresses the view that doubling the capacity of blocks could allow for double the number of Bitcoin users. He feels that more users would bring more node operators and that this simple relationship will overcome the inverse relationship between block size and the number of active nodes. 
So to Roger Ver, more users = more decentralization, and to get more users, you have to increase the block size. 
His point of view seems sensible if you have a general understanding of how Bitcoin works. I would guess that he doesn't have an awareness of things like large-transaction DOS attacks that become exponentially more severe as the blocksize limit increases, and centralization pressures that stem from block propagation delays. To someone who is unaware of those things, being careful with the blocksize limit might seem nonsensical.

It's simple: in case of a fork, if your coins are under your control, you don't have to do anything. Just sit back and watch the show. Your coins will exist on two incompatible chains after the fork. No, that doesn't mean you're twice as rich (not necessarily anyway - that depends on how the market reacts to the new chain and original chain) .
If the forking party are considerate, they will have implemented replay protection in their node client to prevent coins that you spend on the new chain from being replayed on the original chain. 
If the forking party are ignorant or malicious\*, they will not have implemented replay protection so you'll have to find a guide for how to move your coins on one chain to new addresses to effectively shield both sets of coins from replays. 
After the fork you'll have to use the forking party's new client software to access the new chain, and the existing Bitcoin Core client to access to original chain.
\* Note: BU refuses to implement replay protection, so take that as you will.

It was preordained by the Ethereum Foundation that the forked chain would become the dominant chain - that's because of their disproportionate influence over the entire project. The exchanges all fell in line immediately. 
There was no waiting to see if ETC would survive - the fork was always considered ETH. In fact, a day or two passed before Poloniex realizeds that the original chain still had a heartbeat, and they listed it as ETC, giving it market price (I know it was on Bitsquare, but liquidity was so low it was irrelvant).
The situation with Bitcoin is way different. The BU client is from an outsider team. Exchanges are highly skeptical that it would be able to hold a dominant position after an initial burst of 75% of the hash power. It's almost certain that BU-chain will not be listed as BTC.

be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises**, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.


soft-fork which increases capacity and scalability**, and recent speedups
and incoming relay improvements make segwit a reasonable risk. BIP9
and segwit will also make further improvements easier and faster to
deploy. We’ll continue to set the stage for non-bandwidth-increase-based
scaling, while building additional tools that would make bandwidth
increases safer long term. Further work will prepare Bitcoin for further
increases, which will become possible when justified, while also providing
the groundwork to make them justifiable.
The Core devs have found a way to scale blocks **safely**, in a manner that *effectively* is 2-4MB blocksize increase and to do that by April. Further, they are acknowledging that blocksize increase in inevitable, and they will happen *when justified*.

This simply isn't true. What determines bitcoin are the rules as decided by the Economic Majority. This should be clear by the recent joint-announcement made by the exchanges: an out-of-consensus BU chain (a hardfork) will be handled by their Core nodes and listed as "BTU". No amount of hashpower can change that.

I agree that the conversation has become more hostile overall, and I can see that it has driven away a lot of names that I used to see here regularly. But the hostile atmosphere didn't just come out of nowhere. 
It seems to me that it is an inevitable reaction to two years of endlessly negative comments directed towards Core developers and to Blockstream (usually some totally ridiculous conspiracy theory), and to highly upvoted comments that were flat-out misinterpretations or distortions of the issues facing Bitcoin, and to the angry reactions and downvoting directed towards anyone who might suggest that the issues are more complex than just storage costs and the solutions less obvious than simple parameter changes. 
But even still I *do* see reasonable discussion threads, where everyone isn't attacking each and both sides get represented. So I get annoyed when I see claims that "you can't speak your mind unless it's about the moon or hodling", which just isn't true.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:43:15
Bitcoin can survive with 25% of the hash rate. It'll be 40 minute conf times and high fees, but the system will chug along for up to two months until the difficulty resets. Offchain transactions and hodlers remain unaffected. 
Anyway, after the BTU price plummets (assuming it gets listed on exchanges at all), the miners will quickly return to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-03-17 10:15:27
Could this entire debate be partially based on this frustrating misunderstanding? Every other pro-BU commenter seems to believe that Core nodes will accept invalid chains from miners as long as they have a majority hashrate. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:23:28
No it isn't. BU's Emergent Consensus necessarily leads to miner centralization due to the incentives involved. There are only a handful of mining pool operators to begin with, and EC will hand them control of the block size. And then the largest miners with the most resources will be able to create  very large blocks to choke out their competition, reducing the number of miners still further. That's why running BU is giving up decentralization.

BU followers have fetishized a few sentences out of the white paper that talk about the longest-chain rule for determining the winner of competing *valid* chains, and absurdly conclude that the same mechanism also applies to *invalid* chains (chains that implement different consensus rules) - never mind that Satoshi didn't even program the Bitcoin client that way.
So yes, there's a "Church of Satoshi", an inflexible viewpoint that believes an old white paper must be followed to every letter, including misinterpretations of ambiguous sentences. The Church of Satoshi its why we have the otherwise improbable "Bitcoin Unlimited" project threatening not just good sense and reason, but everything this community has worked hard for.

Yes that's true, and it applies to *valid* chains only, i.e. chains that follow the rules as understood by the nodes.


Generally true, yes. However, if the miners decide to create blocks on a new chain that uses different consensus rules, and the nodes haven't updated their software with the same changes, then the miners will have effectively switched to a new altcoin. That's because it's the nodes that define the Bitcoin rules, and not the miners.

Genuine economic nodes (not sybils) are *crucial* because they serve as the entrypoint for users and businesses into the Bitcoin network. If those nodes are Core nodes (and they are, by a devastating margin), then the miners are powerless to change the consensus rules and fork to large blocks.
If the miners choose to ignore that reality, who will accept their blocks? A small community of BU hobbyists and a smattering of businesses. That means their chain will be worthless, and the miners will quickly abandon it.

It depends on how controversial the fork is. A hardfork to 2MB is extremely controversial (because a 2MB softfork option is available) and a significant chain split is guaranteed.

2) If BU adds replay protection, **it will be listed with the ticker symbol BTU**.
If the market is calling your contentious new Bitcoin fork "BTU" instead of "BTC", you've lost the battle before it began.

Bitcoin can't be a decentralized store of value and be used for everyday purchases at the base layer, unless you are willing to give up some decentralization (and thus censorship resistance), which I believe most of us are not.
Bitcoin is digital gold at layer 1, but it will also be possible to use it for everyday purchase at layer 2 or higher. That it what the Lightning Network is all about, and it's why we're so keen on getting SegWit activated: it gives us a safe capacity boost at layer 1 while paving the way for layer 2 solutions.
This ridiculous fight that the two sides are having is because one side refuses to accept that transaction capacity at layer 1 fundamentally can't scale at the rate that they desire. It's frustrating because I believe that both sides do want the same long-term outcomes.

Here's what Joseph Poon, the guy behind Lightning, [has to say about Bram]( and his relevance to Bitcoin:


**Bram is one of the smartest people in Bitcoin.** The BitTorrent protocol consumed a huge double-digit portion of internet traffic several years ago. He has an intuitive understanding of things like global propagation times, which nobody else in this community can match, from a decade-and-a-half of experience.


He's personally given some pretty solid advice on Lightning.

BU hasn't implemented replay protection, so they won't even get listed on exchanges. There's no way the miners would fork under those circumstances.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:30:28
There are no downsides to activating SegWit. 
Even if you think that SegWit isn't nearly enough of an increase, it is at least an incremental step forward that helps to reduce some of the transaction fee pressure. SegWit paves the way for further scaling improvements.
 I think I'm going crazy wondering why anyone could possibly be against a useful incremental capacity upgrade that has been extensively peer-reviewed and put through the wringer on testnet for months.

@_date: 2017-03-16 09:44:39
Huh? Big difference between a soft fork which is compatible with old nodes, and a hard fork which is not. SegWit is a soft fork. It's an excellent way to upgrade the protocol because it prevents the network from splitting. And indeed, this is how Bitcoin has been upgraded for years (P2SH being a notable example).
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:27:53


- The idea that the less-popular chain in a *contentious* hard fork will be abandoned is a myth that was disproven by the ETH/ETC debacle. 
Your statement that the less-popular chain will "quickly lose support and be abandoned" is puzzling in light of that, especially given the battle that's been going on in these forums between two ideological camps. 
A minority chain, whether it's the original chain or BU-chain, will survive because of the strong ideology of its supporters. That's why the Core devs have tried hard to avoid contentious hard forks - they lead to a permanent chain split.
It would be helpful if you could clarify how you intend to determine which chain is the "popular" chain. Will you include data such as node statistics, and how the exchanges are treating the different chains?
Thank you.

It isn't node counts that matter, it's who uses the nodes. If the economic majority of businesses and users run Core nodes, BU miners cannot change the consensus rules.

Exactly! These people are screaming about high fees and full blocks, while SegWit, with a 100% on-chain capacity increase, is sitting there on 80% of the nodes in the system, waiting for activation.
But due to some failing of reading comprehension or god knows what kind of magical thinking, they claim that it isn't *really* a capacity increase for incoherent reasons. They want MAX_BLOCK_SIZE to be increased because it's just "better" or something.
 Blocking SegWit is totally irrational. At this point, Roger Ver and his idiot army are to blame for high fees.

That is irrelevant, because the economic majority doesn't care. See the recent mining industry letter for a sample of what a significant segment of what the economic majority thinks.

@_date: 2017-03-20 17:51:27
They're talking about forking with merely 75% of hashpower, not the network. They're trying to force the economic majority to switch to BU by forcing  a 1-2 month retargeting time on the original chain, and are hinting at attacking the original chain by mining empty blocks. 
In other words, they're trying to blackmail Bitcoin users. Make no mistake, this would be a HOSTILE attack.
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:20:05
Bitcoin is working perfectly when blocks are full. Blocks should always be full, with the contention being resolved by the fee market.

I take issue with the "Bitcoin might go the way of the Rio" part. It's a little early to start anticipating Bitcoin's demise when it's still the leading cryptocurrency, [by far]( and is still growing, at least judging by its [exponential growth curve]( of the transaction rate.

It could significantly damage Bitcoin if there's not enough uptake of the new chain. Look at the instant damage caused by one high-profile developer leaving.

There are so many haters on the sidelines just *waiting* for something like two competing forks, so that they can crow about it and amplify the FUD.

It's not at all comparable, because they were problems related to the *protocol itself*, not with a service running on top of it. Bitcoin never censored transactions or blacklisted addresses, which is what Ethereum is about to do.

No, you have a total misunderstanding of the situation. "Blockstream" didn't in any way meet with Chinese miners nor did they make an agreement. What happened is that a few Core developers, representing only themselves and of their own accord,  went to China to discuss scaling issues with Chinese miners. 
Any "agreements" were with those individuals, who only professed to do what they could as members of the broader Core development community. That had **nothing** to do with Blockstream.

True... Bitcoin was dismissed as dead when it fell to $2. The people who understood its value and stuck with it were rewarded handsomely.

It's clear that the discussion methods at hand - Reddit, mailing lists, BCT, IRC - aren't sufficient to overcome the differences of opinion and perhaps the bad feelings that have arisen in this debate. 
Perhaps getting the major devs into a room would help clear the air and yield an actual agreement. There has to be *some* common ground that can be agreed upon and turned into action.

Hashrate is irrelevant. What matters is the node software being run by the economically important nodes, and right now they're overwhelmingly running Core. Hashrate can't force those Core nodes to accept different consensus rules.
That's why BU is dead - it's become a punchline and the economic majority will not install it. The miners probably understand this by now, which is why they won't fork no matter how much hashrate signals for BU, unless they're crazy or they want to create an altcoin.

Bitcoin is censorship resistant money. That's all it has to be for it to be a resounding success. It will continue to skyrocket in value for that fundamental property alone. 
There's a huge amount of wealth in the world that's been waiting for something like Bitcoin to come along - a way to store and transfer value without asking for permission. The potential opportunity of a high-rate payment system is piss in comparison.
You don't need a high TPS rate to be a transferable store of value. What you need is a system that has a track record of being resistant to political maneuvering as it fulfills its promise of censorship resistance. That's what brings in the savers, the international B2B  money transfers, the whales parking their wealth. 
I'm perfectly happy for Bitcoin to remain with its current settings if SegWit can't get consensus.

They're under the impression that forking the chain will be winner-takes-all - that the node operators, businesses, and users currently using Core will be compelled to switch to Classic.
What will actually happen is that there will be two coins. Many people (perhaps even most - it's really the miners who will decide if Classic's new consensus rules get activated) will stick with Bitcoin Core for political/ideological reasons. What the world currently knows as Bitcoin will continue on, and Classic will basically be a brand new coin. 
Unfortunately, both coins will plummet in price. Bitcoin will likely have to change its hash function as a defensive measure against the Classic miners. It would be bad for both coins and bad for cryptocurrency in general.

There are many good reasons why Bitcoin is here to stay, but here are two that benefit me:
 - It reduces the cost and hassle of transferring money - no wire or Western Union fees, etc.
 - Lowers the barrier to entry for running a business. You don't need to apply for a merchant account, and find a payment processor that will take 3% or more of your revenue - you just need to have a bitcoin address. 
 
I've been using Bitcoin for a year now to purchase things like computer hardware and a VPS service, and I use it to transfer money to a distant programmer which saves me money on wire transer fees. 
Bitcoin is a low cost value transfer protocol without a central authority, it hasn't yet been compromised, and it's used regularly by people like me.

Bitcoin simply doesn't offer any clear advantages over standard payment methods, at least at the cash register. Nor would any cryptocurrency. You need third parties to mate them with the established (and incredibly convenient) payment networks. That's OK, but that's not what cryptocurrencies are for. 
Bitcoin excels as a censorship-resistant value transfer method made specifically for the Internet, and as a store of value that doesn't require a bank. 
That's why it continues to survive to this day, because those properties aren't possible with regular forms of money.

The fee market preserves miner incentives while maximizing decentralization by keeping the blocksize small. 
SegWit is an improvement on fee distribution that incentivizes cleaning up the UTXO set. It also roughly doubles the blocksize while solving transaction malleability and the quadratic-time signature operations problem.

That was an implementation bug that required an obvious and uncontroversial fix. By the rules of the system, nobody was supposed to have 180 billion bitcoins. 
The DAO bailout was an entirely different situation. In that case, the rules of a poorly-implemented contract were exploited. This wasn't a bug in Ethereum itself. It wasn't even really a bug in the contract if you agreed with the contract publisher's loud claim that "code is law." 
It turned out that code was only law if the outcome of that code was desirable. The DAO debacle demonstrated that the Ethereum foundation (some of whom had a personal stake in the DAO) didn't really believe in *code is law*, and that the community promise of *contracts that can't be stopped* was worth violating if enough important people were being affected.
That kind of corruption of ideals *never* happened to Bitcoin.

Trade with money that you can afford to lose. It should be play money that you're not emotionally attached to.
This is important for the obvious reason of not ending up in dire financial straits should you make some bad trades or if the price of Bitcoin tanks.
The other reason is that if you're too emotionally invested in the value of BTC, you'll panic with each price swing and you'll end up selling low and buying high. You're less likely to do this if you know that you can survive losing your money in a worst-case scenario.

This post proposes that if BU gains 75% hash power, that will be more than enough to fork safely. 
Why? Because of the sudden and severe loss of hash power, the original chain will have to wait potentially weeks or months for difficulty to retarget down to a level that can be handled by the remaining hash power.
There are two major problems with this.
1) It is highly unlikely that BU will ever gain 75% or more of the existing hashpower.
2) Even if BU manages to sway that much hashpower, it certainly does NOT mean the end of the original chain, because obviously its supporters (including me) will support a defensive hard fork to a different work function, making the difficulty problem moot. There's are a substantial number of GPU miners who would *love* the chance to mine bitcoin.
So let's get real here. This reminds me of pro-fork proponents in Ethereum obstinately denying that a minority chain could ever exist. What they failed to recognize is that contentious chain splits are driven by ideology. 
I, and many others (including the best cryptocurrency programmers on the planet - the *Core* community) will *never* support a hostile takeover by BU. We do not support their vision, which is growth at any cost, consequences be damned. 
There. Will. Be. Two. Chains.

The price run-up to $30 was a minor bubble fueled by wild speculation, and has nothing to do with the long term viability of Bitcoin. 
The fact that the price is falling now is a probably a combination of profit taking by early adopters and the fact that trade volume on Mt. Gox is very low and therefore volatile.
The process of acceptance by the public at large will be gradual as more and more vendors start accepting BTC and as retail and web payment systems mature.
If the cryptography holds up and enough infrastructure builds up to make Bitcoin as convenient (or better) as regular currencies, then I think it will be in very high demand in a few years. Those who invest early in the infrastructure will be rewarded.

There will be a significant fraction of the Bitcoin economy, maybe even most of it (Just because 75% of the hashpower supports it doesn't mean that the economic majority does), that will still use what it calls "Bitcoin", and that Bitcoin will be using a different work function. 
It doesn't matter if 75% of mining power *and* the economic majority split off to to the BU chain, the remaining minority is *ideologically opposed* that that new chain and will remain that the original chain.
Both sides will call their chain "Bitcoin".

I think the amount paid out per block is mostly irrelevant, as the value of each coin will naturally adjust to reflect coin scarcity.

Of course it isn't a ponzi. You can sell your Bitcoin at any time. The price of a bitcoin is determined by the forces of supply and demand. Ponzis don't have those properties.
In a ponzi scheme, you're at the mercy of the operator. He decides when to pay you a dividend for your "investment". He alone decides when to bail and leave you holding the bag.
Bitcoin is nothing like that. If Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme then so is any tradable scarce item, real or abstract. If someone agrees that to be the case, then they must disagree with the entire economic system as we know it, arguing from some alien position that's lightyears away from normal human experience.
It boggles my mind that anyone can read the standard definition of a Ponzi scheme and apply that to Bitcoin. It's not merely a distortion of the term, it's a complete lie.

Bitcoin can indeed be viewed as a payment system, but pulling back a bit, it's actually a decentralized, portable store of value for the internet. What's funny is that Satoshi already defined it quite succinctly in the very title of his whitepaper:

"Energy efficiency" doesn't make any sense. A decentralized cryptocurrency must be expensive to attack in order for it to be secure.

It was basically - just ignorant opinion after ignorant opinion, and arguments based on lies and faulty technical premises. Without the heavy and decisive moderation employed by Theymos and crew, I would have long abandoned Reddit as a source of Bitcoin news and discussion.
In my opinion, Theymos did what he needed to do to restore the subreddit to some level of civility. I would hope that the Reddit admins would take this into account before falling for a coup attempt by Brian Armstrong and Roger Ver.

Agreed, Bitcoin's killer app is that it's a portable, censorship-free store of value. 
But that's hard to sell when the price keeps sinking, so people are looking for other uses for "blockchain technology", forgetting that the most compelling and amazing use is already working and shaking things up. 
Eventually the price will stabilize at a new floor, just like it did in 2011 (at around $5) and in 2012 (at around $13) for several months. That's when bitcoin as a portable store of value becomes compelling, bringing in the next wave of new adopters.
All the other fancy blockchain uses will always be curiosities with limited use cases in my opinion.

Raising the limit will make running nodes more expensive, and will increase centralization pressure on miners. Both of those effects serve to reduce Bitcoin's decentralization, the main property that gives Bitcoin its reason to exist.

Transactions wouldn't immediately pin to 7/s were Amazon to announce its acceptance of bitcoin. Transactions would ramp up gradually as new users acquire bitcoin to spend. The Bitcoin community could react accordingly by raising the block limit if necessary.

SegWit is a scaling solution. Besides the blocksize increase to 2.1MB, it makes 2nd layer solutions such as Lightning Network practical. SegWit opens the door to a broader landscape of scaling options - it's an extremely important step forward for Bitcoin.

Yes, a lot of people mistakenly liken Bitcoin to an application like Napster or Facebook. Bitcoin is actually a protocol and a platform on which application layers can be stacked. 
Protocols only have to be first and to be "good enough" for them to become entrenched in a technology ecosystem, just like TCP/IP or HTTP. 
Bitcoin, too, is good enough to serve as the base layer in a massive global financial system. Moneyed interests will have a strong incentive to extend and adapt the protocol as needed. 
That's why I think it will always remain dominant.

Bitcoin's increasing adoption necessarily results in a rising price due to a limited supply.

Hi Dan!
It's exciting that you're actively working on finding an optimal work function.
So let's say you achieve (what I believe to be) your goal of developing an algorithm that levels the hardware playing field such that a million processors held by one party has the equivalent hashing power of one processor held by a million parties.
It seems to me that the large party will still have an energy efficiency advantage given a large enough scale and a well-engineered deployment. That advantage would tend to drive a home miner's profit down to near zero, destroying their incentive to mine.

It's completely different. That was an exploit due to a value overflow bug in the Bitcoin client itself. Clearly, the exploit was a violation of the rules of Bitcoin, and it couldn't have survived for long. 
It was an *invalid transaction*, and the fix was simple and uncontroversial. In fact, the fix technically wasn't even a hard fork. You could, in principle, run the pre-exploit client today and validate the entire chain.
The DAO exploit, on the other hand, involved the execution of valid  contract instructions. Ethereum's EVM itself wasn't exploited. That a recursive withdrawal could be executed was unforseen and undesirable, but it was valid from a protocol point of view.
Ethereum isn't broken. The DAO contract was poorly written, and the hardfork to reverse the contract exploit punishes those of us who didn't have a stake in that contract (because it violates the rules of the system as laid out, breaking the promise of "unstoppable code", and tarnishing the reputation of the system).
So I'll clarify:
Bitcoin's community never altered the outcome of a *valid* transaction.

That chance is virtually zero. People naturally gravitate towards the medium of exchange that has the highest liquidity, and in cryptocurrencies that is Bitcoin. Yes, it is being used as a store of value, but it's also quite clearly being used as a currency. It is both. 
Litecoin is a distant second place as both a currency as a store of value, and it will very likely remain so due to Bitcoin's enormous head start.

I tried Ripple for a while, but I just couldn't be bothered with the trust relationships that you're supposed to curate in order to make the system functional. Too much of a pain in the ass.
Ripple's answer to that is that you can simply put your trust in one or two "gateways" if you're lazy like I am, but that introduces a centralized element, making it vulnerable to all the problems of a centralized system.
If the peer-to-peer credit thing doesn't take off, Ripple's fallback position as a straight Bitcoin competitor (using XRP) makes it a pointless also-ran.

Bitcoin is a technology first and foremost. Its central innovation is the employment of a globally distributed ledger (aka the "blockchain") that requires no trust and has no central point of failure. It's revolutionary.
The ledger can support multiple applications, such as asset register, document signing, and potentially a provably fair voting scheme. Bitcoin-as-currency just happens to be the most obvious and most popular use of the system.
The correct way to think of Bitcoin is that it's a technology platform that can support an enomrous ecosystem of financial applications.

Unless an altcoin is superior in some major way to Bitcoin, it will likely never achieve the same level of adoption.
For example, TCP/IP is the dominant stateful connection protocol on the Internet, even though others exist. 
People will naturally gravitate to the currency with the largest number of users, because that currency will be the most stable and have the highest liquidity. Unless it screws up in a big way, that will probably be Bitcoin.
That doesn't mean that there can't be a niche role for one or two altcoins, but no more than that, and they'll always play second fiddle to Bitcoin.

Agreed, but if one insists upon such a thing, it can be argued that the alternate uses of the blockchain (asset register, document time stamping, etc) give Bitcoin its "intrinsic value". In other words, the non-monetary use of Bitcoin is its globally distributed, general-purpose ledger.

Let's say that someone comes up with a hypothetical hashing algorithm that is most efficiently run on commodity CPUs. Serious mining operations will just accumulate as many CPUs as is required to be competitive. They'll have the resources to buy CPUs at steep volume discounts, and arrange them efficiently on densely packed blades.

Bitcoin was first - it was released in 2009. Ripple in its current form was released by Ripple Labs some time late last year. Bitcoin didn't borrow the decentralized payment network concept from Ripple - that's ridiculous.
Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work scheme to secure its distributed ledger. Ripple uses a completely different scheme based on consensus. 
Ripple's claim to fame is its peer-to-peer credit system, which allows individuals to establish chained lines of credit with one another, thereby permitting debts to be traded easily within the network. Currency exchange is one practical application of this.
My experience with this feature is that it's interesting but a little too tedious to be practical for the average joe. There  are also issues regarding defaults and settlement.
Ripple included a currency called XRP that can be traded within its network. Ostensibly they're to be used merely as a transaction fee in order to discourage transaction spam, but they also function as a currency. Ripple Labs controls the vast majority of the XRP pile.
Edit: It's this centralized control of XRPs that make Ripple seem like a centralized currency in the eyes of many.

Vegas casinos are better able to disguise this activity because their bet transactions aren't public.
In contrast, every single SatoshiDice bet and payout is recorded on the blockchain for all to see. Here's today's report: [SatoshiDice Statistical Analysis]( This means that we know if it's playing fair odds, and we also know exactly how much it's earning.
So far, SatoshiDice has generated 10,000+ BTC this month in profit. 100% of those profits go out to the shareholders. 87% of the shares are currently owned by SatoshiDice founders, but 13% are trading publicly, primarily on [MPEx]( and on brokers/passthroughs like [CoinBR]( and [Havelock Investments]( 
So, if SatoshiDice operators are running bots, those bots will lose at the same rate as everyone else, and the profits must then flow through to the shareholders, 13% of whom aren't the owners of SatoshiDice. 
This means that bot activity would lose money for the owners over the long run, just like it would for regular players. Is it worth it to generate buzz and therefore more players? Possibly, but the betting history doesn't seem to indicate this.

That's what is claimed, but it clearly isn't true. XRPs are being traded just like any other virtual coin. The Ripple founders are counting on XRP rising in value to compensate themselves, as one of them even said in the Bitcointalk forums. That's not a bad thing in itself, but it contradicts the whole "it's just stamps" claim.
The problem, then, is that XRPs are distributed by Ripple Inc, not by the community through some sort of competitive process (i.e., mining). 
It also seems obvious that if the P2P credit part of Ripple never takes off, they hope to fallback to being just a virtual currency using XRP. Again, not bad in itself, but people shouldn't have this idea that Ripple isn't nipping at Bitcoin's heels.

If it makes you feel better, you can buy 1 mBTC for $0.80. Or 1000 mBTC for $800. Bitcoin users will eventually price things in mBTC or uBTC as the currency gains value.
In other words, the price per bitcoin isn't an important as the total value of all bitcoins, which is around $10B at the moment. That's very small! 
Since Bitcoin is still in the early stages of the adoption cycle (bitcoin hasn't really reached general consciousness yet), and adoption is strongly reflected in the price, I don't think it's crazy to suggest that there's still a ton of upside potential.

The same thing was said about HTTP and SMTP back in the 90s. 
Those were flawed protocols and it was easy to imagine better implementations, but there are two main reasons they remain dominant today:
  1) They were widely adopted before anything else could get a foothold
  2) They were good enough
Bitcoin is a flawed protocol, but it may remain dominant for the same reasons.

I think this is an overreaction, and I wish the community would calm down a bit and take a deep breath about all of this (specifically the CoinValidation thing). I'm not worried yet, here's why:
1) We don't know if the U.S. government will pass a law requiring vendors or exchanges to only accept registered addresses. That's not necessarily a given. There hasn't even been an official discussion about it.
2) There will eventually be financial institutions and very wealthy individuals holding substantial bitcoin positions, so it's not hard to imagine those forces lobbying against anti-bitcoin legislation. 
3) Not all countries will impose draconian regulations on Bitcoin transactions. Those that do will miss out on one of the most transformational shifts in finance in a generation. Capital will flow to countries that embrace Bitcoin fully.

This simply isn't true. The altcoins are incompatible with Bitcoin, and they have different networks of users. The altcoins also don't have the same number of services, vendors, venture capitalists, and developers, nor do they have anywhere near the same level of media exposure that Bitcoin has.

It said something like


The strings command is a specialized tool that is completely unrelated to Bitcoin.
It would be possible to create a tool that searched through reddit threads and extracted hidden URLs. I think most people would agree that distributing hidden URLs is an unintended use of Reddit, just like using 'strings' to extract ASCII from the blockchain is an unintended use of Bitcoin.

But popularity matters tremendously.
Because Bitcoin has had a considerable head start in popularity, it has the most liquidity, the most users, and the largest application ecosystem. As such, the value of Bitcoin (and I don't mean market cap) is running away exponentially from the altcoins due to network effects. It is therefore becoming more and more unlikely that an altcoin will replace Bitcoin, at least not in the next several years. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 13:09:32
Because it's "OpenCoin's Ripple". It's a private initiative masquerading as an open-source, community driven project. In that respect, it's the opposite of Bitcoin.
Also, I'm annoyed at how this private organization tries to bootstrap their get-rich-quick scheme by parasitizing Bitcoin's popularity and momentum. I wish Ripple promoters would post in their own message boards and threads - let it do the hard work of gaining acceptance on its own. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:21:11
Litecoin failed in its mission: to allow the average user to mine with a normal computer. 
So now it's just a bitcoin clone with a different hashing algorithm and 4x the block rate. It can potentially serve a minor role as something like an arbitrage currency, but due to network effects it will never be as popular or as liquid as Bitcoin.
Anyway, I don't hate it. I just hate it when Litecoiners try to promote it here and get free publicity. We did the hard work of getting Bitcoin off the ground from zero, so Litecoiners need do do their own hard work if they want it to be a success.

Bitcoin is fundamentally a globally distributed ledger that can be used as a platform for multiple applications, a currency being one of them. 
Even if bitcoin-as-currency fails, other applications will persist such as a global asset register. Because of this, the ledger units will always have some non-monetary use or value, and thus that is Bitcoin's "intrinsic value".

Snark aside, it's a very well-run exchange. It's highly secure and is supported by a community of sophisticated investors.
All interaction with the exchange is via GPG-signed statements. Most people use a command-line python tool called pyMPEx to issue commands. 
The website is mostly irrelevant to the operation of MPEx, and the owner has even toyed with getting rid of it altogether. The only people who judge MPEx by what it shows on port 80 are the kind of people who really should be using a broker.
MPEx features a fine array of BTC options, and there's nothing else out there that competes with it in that area. It also has S.DICE and S.MPOE, the two most valuable stocks in Bitcoinland, each valued in the neighborhood of 600k BTC.
The 30BTC fee is intended to weed out retail investors from larger players. If 30BTC is too much to pay, then the various brokers/passthroughs are your best bet. My vote is for [CoinBR](

It's not news around here because scams/thefts have been a problem from day 1, just like they are with USD or any other currency. They have little to do with Bitcoin itself, except to demonstrate that there are thieves out there who want to steal from you, so take care.
You have to do your research when considering which exchange to use. In the inputs.io case, people were trusting their bitcoins with some anonymous guy. Not smart. 
Look for an exchange that lists the full names of the owners/operators, has a physical and verifiable address, appears to be following applicable laws and regulations, has a reputation, etc.
