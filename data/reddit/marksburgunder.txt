Mate... Bitpay should just provide a bitcoin address like it has in the past and the amount. What wallet I use should not be your concern.
This is going to hurt BitPay and piss off a lot of users!

The next thing is to just have conversations about Bitcoin with people...

Seems like a good selection of android wallets.
The wallet privacy rating report at  looks like a good resource to me. It's only been released once so far and doesn't yet cover all the wallets but it does break down what to look out for in a wallet at this time.
