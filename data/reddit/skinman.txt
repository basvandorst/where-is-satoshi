Which is why all PM reddits tell you not to use vaults and dealers to store your PMs.  Again, someone new to BTC would have a hard time finding that advice on this reddit.  Yes, I personally wouldn't, but that's because I'm transferring my basic knowledge of holding what you own on PMs to digital currency.  This would not be the case for people new and just jumping in to setup wallets and accounts on what other people recommend.
I think the lack of discussion on the subject is the issue, not that it happens.
If an online wallet or exchange goes down, I would have expected more of a community discussion about it that just... nothing;  especially if you're trying to get more of the general public involved.  Without the front page discussion, of real problems, then people that might be interested, but have done a bit of homework, will just jump ship.
Consider it more of a PR problem.  People don't mind problems, as long as they are aware they exist, and are aware of how to mitigate the risks.  That isn't happening here, and I think it's actually detrimental to the health of the currency.
Also, people will not use BTC for small purchases, simply due to the volatile nature of the bubble atm.
You laud people buying a subway with BTC.  But the guy that bought the subway, by the time he gets home and finds the BTC he spent on a sandwich is now worth 2 of them, makes you think not to spend them at all, which brings btc straight back in to commodity and not currency, which makes bubbles much more likely.

I own a manufacturing business. I could never accept btc as payment, because the delay in turning btc to fait, that I can then use to pay my suppliers and staff, who don't accept btc is unacceptable. 
I do run in border areas as well, and its enough of a headache to get my bank to accept foreign currency that is backed by a sovereign government, never mind a virtual currency, whos value fluctuates so wildly.
Invoice for £200 paid by btc?  I would have no guarantee that I would get that from a btc exchange 24 hours later, never mind the 'guess the transaction time' bolted on.
If it's not stable, then it is of no use to business, apart from bringing neck beards out of the basement and in to the real world for a beer every now and then.  For actual business transactions, it is just gambling with your cash flow, which is always tight enough.

Precious Metal.

Nothing that you have said actually mitigates any issues that I mentioned about the reddit, but just confirms them.
Get back to your miners and then think about actually getting people to embrace BTC and not look at the short term buy/sell, which is what will actually kill BTC.

No, I could just keep the widely fluctuating currency in my pocket and buy a beer for the current FAIT that isn't going to change much in the next week or two.  Then I can dump the stallion when it suits, and have my cake and eat it.
BTC will never be good for vendors when the price is so volatile, and that will limit its uptake with personal transactions.
BTC **NEEDS** to stabalise before it can be widely accepted as a real payment option.
The exchanges also **NEED** to prove that they are reliable, and be able to convert BTC to FAIT in a short time frame (24hrs max), before vendors take it seriously, and not just as a gimmick.
Also, you are getting in to the situation of no power or internet connection.  But that's a different story.

Ok, I understand the underlying rule of not using an online wallet, which I would see as the same as using an overseas vault for PM's.
My point, is that there is no public discussion about the issue on this reddit.
If I go to a PM reddit and say I'm going to put all PM's I buy in to a vault or box, not controlled by myself, there would be plenty of discussion as to pros and cons.
Here, for digital currency, there is nothing.
If a vault or bank gets raided, it would be discussed on the PM reddits.  Here, it is as if it didn't happen.  The problem is not that it happens, it is that those curious to invest have no clue as to how often exchanges and wallets can just vanish.
As I said, it's not that it happens (shit happens to PM stackers all the time), it's the fact that it is not discussed in the reddit, as if it was a dirty secret, that should be kept quiet to bring in more buyers.
The whole way the BTC public relations is done just makes it look more and more like a pyramid scheme, not because of BTC itself, but because of the way advocates of BTC seem to bury news, good or bad.
As I said I'm still interested, but the whole 'make news of criminal actions' vanish and downvote discussions on the issue just leaves a bad taste in the mouth.

Well, if you have it, and people accept it, then spend it.

Then make it a sticky so n00bs like me have a quick link to common concerns.  Use the side bar to link to exchanges that have a good rep.
This reddit is going to be the first stop to people new to BTC, so don't turn it into a neckbeard forum where everybody needs to know what an ASIC miner is.
BTC is already bubbling.  If you don't want it to crash and take people down with it, then educate, don't just say 'BUY'.  Even if you can buy goods and services with BTC, no one will if the value spikes and drops $60 in 12 hours; it has to stabilise to become worth spending as currency, otherwise it's just an investment, and will yo-yo against a more stable currency as people buy in and cash out.

And that's problem.  I would never buy a beer for any amount of BTC if the value of it could double or half by the time I got out of the taxi home.
If you want a currency, used every day, then it has to be stable.  It is not, and will not be when it's both disparaged and inflated on the same day by multiple media and banking advocates/detractors.
It's bubbling now because of the media hype.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the original purpose was to be able to exchange FAIT to BTC, transfer the BTC, and then exchange to FAIT at the other end?  That is not happening now, it has become it's own demise, if isn't reigned in before people get burned.
