That’s what I did. I do wish luck to everyone who is holding and riding out the market. Have a couple friends who’ve gone down either path. Wish there wasn’t such a negative outlook on people with that viewpoint in this sub but I suppose it should be BTCs biggest fan. I wish anyone invested wealth and good fortune!

I feel bad for you in real life man and can’t really imagine you as a social being if you’re anything like how you post. Something must really suck to have to be so condescending towards people behind the blanket of anonymity. Feel free to DM if you need someone to talk to or are going through a hard time

It’s not 2013. I know everyone memes there way into feeling comfortable about the future but no one knows.

Dude I don’t need internet points to feel good so I really don’t need support, especially in a random thread like this. It’d be one thing if you were a witty troll posting outlandish shit for a laugh but you seem hell bent on making all your responses elitist. Sorry shit is like that. Hope shit looks up

Yeah should we check before or after we do our chores and brush our teeth?

I think there’s a decent amount of people that believe entirely in blockchain technology and not necessarily the longevity of bitcoin, more so seeing it as a flashy test run.

You’ve been investing for 6 years yet you posted that you’re 21 years old. So you’ve been an investor since 15. So you’re a trading savant. Maybe that’s why your written verbal skills are so non relatable to this whole thread. Either that or you’re a pseudo intellect who gets his rocks off on asking if his IQ scores are good.

Research day trading in general. You can set alarms in apps to let you know when it goes above or below a threshold to buy/sell but just like gambling, you have to decide for yourself when to walk away from the table.

My daily limit was fluctuating all day and purchases wouldn't go through except for a small test amount. I've had Coinbase for 72 hours, been locked out from purchasing twice and it's been nothing but an awful and inconsistent experience.

a bubble.... you know, those things that pop, then magically regenerate itself and pop again...

All good. I stuck to the old "only put in what you're willing to lose" but I am tired of people telling others to "be patient" on something like an exchange lol

My transactions went from cancelled, then after maintenance 3 of the cancelled transactions magically moved to pending (great, I have double charges pending). Now I'm just locked out from too many transaction attempts even though I attempted twice this morning. CoinBase has been awful and taken days to get any one small transaction to go through
