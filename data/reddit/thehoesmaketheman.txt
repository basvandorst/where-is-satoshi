Thats your only rebuttal lmfao.  Getting pedantic.  Everything I pointed out and you're only response is that's it's just like a Ponzi but without the central point.  Lol. lmfao.  What a jackass.
 It's a decentralised Ponzi with many heads.  And lots of sub scams.  I said it was a new twist right?  The internet was always going to enable scamming and it has.  But this is the greatest scam yet.  Because like you said there's no real central guy to takedown. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:38:54
Yea it's huge.  But the key is nonexistent.  The product is nonexistent or near enough as to make no difference.  Less than 1% of bitcoin transactions are retail.  The rest is trading.  So all bitcoin does is bitcoin.  Like the pyramid scheme where everyone is buying their own products and only the people way upstream make money.
Anyways, now that the early investors made money what's the point of bitcoin?  Nothing.  It was just a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:57:25
Congrats you're a pyramid schemer real cool

@_date: 2018-01-28 15:46:41
Well as you've probably figured out crypto "investing" is a zero sum game where every person who's taken out more money than they put in gaurantees someone will be taking out less.  Like a new twist on the classic Ponzi or pyramid scheme. 
It depends heavily on lies and unfulfilled promises and confusion about what crypto is.  The confusion is important.  And the recruitment of new members by people like yourself.  I can only hope someday you are put in jail given how many people you admit to recruiting for a pyramid scheme.
Less than .1% of crypto transactions are for any retail purpose.  That will never hold up as legitimate commerce.  Please don't delete this post it will help when the Ponzi crashes.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:04:15
Sounds like you A. Are not going to respond to any points I made.  Which is typical of you people haha. Keep em confused right?
If you've pulled out more USD than you put in, where did that money come from?  Say it with me - we all know the answer - someone else.  The retail transactions for crypto are an abysmally low percent of total transactions.  Existing investors get paid out with the money from new investors.  No real product exists.  Extremely confusing.  Obfuscation.  Recruitment.  It's got everything.
And the hate for existing banks? That's a Ponzi scheme classic!  Ponzi himself said he would make a new kind of bank.  It's literally the classic!
Stop fuckin lying.  Just admit it's a Ponzi scheme and you don't care.  Why's that hard, why do you people need to hang onto your little story?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:46:40
So essentially pyramid scheme.  Got it.

Oh my bad.  I didn't phrase that well.  There is a general consensus among economic experts that a central bank is the best way to operate an economy.
I'll repeat again.  You have zero examples of real world success with your economic model.  You have zero credentials to be making these sweeping radical recommendations.  Do you understand that?
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:05:03
No a central bank with an adjustable money supply is a better currency.  Adjustable and adaptive money supply is a critical economic tool.  
Fixed deflationary currency like bitcoin is idiotic and the supporters of it are manchildren. 
There's not a single example of a functioning Austrian economics system because it doesn't work so it's an oxymoron.  Much like you're a moron .
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:40:05

@_date: 2018-05-14 15:10:10
Uhh my country is going pretty good so I'm pretty sure it works just fine.  You don't like adaptability eh? Hahaha.  Needs to be trustless right?
People who cannot be trusted often feel that noone can be trusted.  But really they're just pieces of shit.
You don't have any examples of your Austrian economics functioning because there are none.  Because it can't work.  If you feel like societys system doesn't work for you, maybe we all just don't like you?  Could that be the case and that's what's you're mad about?

Riiiight.  That means experts don't know what they are talking about.  Because slavery happened.  Good one.
Violence backs literally everything.  That's how society works.  We gave the complete right to violence to the government.  They are the arbitrator of force.  Bitcoin has nothing to do with violence.  Violence will absolutely still be required.
If people don't obey societys rules they can't just walk away.  Society enforces the rules.  That's how it works.
You have zero credentials.  You have no clue wtf you are talking about.  Just do YOUR job.  Whatever the fuck that is.  That's what you need to be doing. Not talking out of your ass about macroeconomics.  Dumbass.

Yup.  It's the consensus best possible system of all time.
You subscribe to fringe economic theories, most of which seemed to be centered around distrust.  That seems to be your core economic concept.  You have no working real world examples AND you have zero credentials to even be making these recommendations.  You lose sir.

No I explained.  I assumed that's why you jumped in.  Clearly that wasn't it.  So why did you?
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:54:39
You people love this little inflation bit you do guys do.  Inflation is driven by market forces, not a magic money printer.  An intelligently controlled money supply is an excellent economic management tool.  This is fact.  You want to replace it with some kinda rigid unadaptable  system with less flexibility?
Are you suggesting you want a deflationary currency?

People don't take me serious?  What did you have a vote?  99.999% of butters aren't listening to a word I say.  They are trying to get money.  That's all they care about.
They don't care about fixing the economy, or helping others or a fair system.  They want $$$$ and don't give a fuck about the consequences.  They're greedy and stupid.  And if I can't say the insults, what's the fun in that for me?
@_date: 2018-05-14 21:00:19
Well i have GREAT NEWS for you then.  The system has been changing all the time!  Aren't you relieved?  It improves year after year as it's tweaked and new laws and rules are made.  Compare the central bank and economic regulations from 1900 to today!  Lots better.  So don't worry.  Fucking teenagers on Reddit are not needed in order for the system to improve.  Aren't you happy? Now go forth and tell idiots who don't know shit about economics to shut the fuck up.
These people are seeking to upend modern society.  In order to enrich themselves.  They are terroristic pieces of shit.  The people I care about and myself rely on modern society for our well being.  How do you think I'm going to react to retards trying to destroy that?
This isn't a debate.  We aren't two HVAC installers talking about the best way to install a furnace.  These are whiny manchildren who are totally unqualified railing against society because they're failures.  Which isn't our fault.  They just suck.
@_date: 2018-05-15 04:17:11
Not sure what your point is but you're advocating fixed supply currency.  That's by its very nature deflationary unless progress stops and productivity goes downward.
I'm sure it has worked out for you.  If you've cashed out you managed a wealth transfer of other people's money to you without providing any goods or services.  If that's what you're into then you benefited.  Cool story.  I've never said money can't be made off pyramid schemes.

Actually centralised systems are the most adaptable because you don't need a vote to change something.  You just change it.  And you ignored my question.
Since you can provide no examples of your system and the success it provides, I have to ask where your expertise comes from.  The US is a 19 trillion dollar economy that supports over 300 million people over 4 million square miles.  What have you done in your life that has made you think you know how to run it?

Hahaha you seek to destroy society by circumventing our controls.  You're a terroristic piece of shit.  Luckily we pay the government to prevent you from doing exactly that.  And I highly doubt you've had much success in real life so excuse me if I'm not exactly scared of you undertaking an endeavour.
Quick question, have you ever considered being like hey, modern society is pretty nice and we all live pretty nice lives compared to the last 200,000 years of human history.  Maybe I should stop being such a whiny bitch about everything and trying to subvert the very society that provided these things to me?  Maybe I'm not some great economics guru ?
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:46:27
Because it's a scam where everyone cannot win. Most people lose. Someone gets left holding the bag and it causes economic damage and personal anguish to people.  It's why we outlawed pyramid schemes rather than tell people Sorry For Your Loss.
What you're doing is wrong.  Plain and simple.  I understand that you don't care.  That's why I said you're a piece of shit.  It's not the end of the world to be a piece of shit.  But you are one.

So the output of goods grows all the time.  If more money wasn't injected into the system then we would have the same amount of money chasing more goods.  Increased buying power.  That causes deflation.  Are you in favor of a deflationary currency?

@_date: 2019-12-18 23:17:14
not by a survey.  thats stupid.
inflation isnt a problem. its a feature. inflation means money itself isnt an investment, which it should not be. its a means of exchange. the USD has lost 98% of its value in the past 100 years. that means if the richest family in the US had just sat on their money this whole time it would all practically be gone. thats GOOD for equality. that means you cant just sit on magical spreadsheet cells and get wealthier while doing absolutely nothing.
regular people dont have investments in cash, they have them in businesses (including stocks), in land, in buildings, all things that have actual value to people. those provide all our goods, services, and shelter. those are the only things of actual value in the world.
their money is in those things, inflation has no effect on them. if all those things go away, yes so does their wealth. but that would mean our world is actually destroyed, so that would be an accurate reflection of their reality. we cant have all our land and businesses and shelters destroyed but still have our spreadsheet cells and be rich. we cant eat spreadsheet cells.
poor people dont have any money. inflation has no effect on them.
as you can see, inflation doesnt hurt anybody if its done well. in fact its absolutely critical. it has to be done well, but so does everything. heart surgery doesnt help if its done terribly.
@_date: 2019-12-19 19:14:31
bitcoin is an artificially limited spreadsheet cell squatting scheme.  
Cryptocurrency is guys buying spreadsheet cells for actualmoney because they (usually desperately) bet that other guys will buy the cells off them for more actualmoney in the future. Those guys buy the cells because they are betting (usually desperately) that other guys will buy the cells off them for even more actualmoney in the future. Those guys buy the cells because they are betting (usually desperately) that other guys will buy the cells off them for even more actualmoney in the future. On and on.
One of the defining characteristics of any ponzi or pyramid is recruitment being the source of revenue rather than any product sales or other means. Crypto people call this "adoption" or "mass adoption" and they are obsessed with it. Recruitment is the only meaningful goal of crypto currencies and they barely bother to disguise it. Actual goods/services are orders of magnitude less meaningful and realistically have no meaning at all to the majority of participants beyond a disguise.

I dont care if coiners *think* inflation is stealing their wealth.  They can think the moon is cheese, it isnt.  Who cares?  Theyre morons.

So just to clear this little weasel statement from you up - of course I fucking know they think that.  Theyre idiots.  You may have noticed that I am aware of the things they think.

I never said it couldnt be used for crime.  I have always said that once society bans the stuff I dont give a shit who uses it after that. Its just bad practice for a society to enable this snake oil, non-accredited investor, ponzi scheme crap. Once banks stop working with it similar to AML practices and its relegated to the criminal realm I really dont care. No more banking, no more exchanges, no more apps on Android or Apple store. That pretty much stops Joe Sixpack and Freshman Gamerkid from getting roped into the scam.
After that, people can do all the crime they want. I dont know how they did crime before and I didnt care. Not my job to catch criminals. Have your crimebux and go to town. Crime it up.
Crypto is censorship resistant so it wont even matter if its banned, right?  It just doesnt make sense to have this stuff be legal when its only use is to do crime.

how is it disinflationary?  its not.  just like i told u/bitusher


2018 it was wildly inflationary. At what point did it "decrease" in speed of inflation? Since November it lost 40% of its purchasing power. How is that disinflationary? How is that a slowdown? Thats a speed-up.
In 2017 $1000-$14000 = wildly deflationary. 2016 $400 to $1000 = wildly deflationary. 2015 $300-$400 = 33% deflation! 2014 $900-$300 = wild inflation!
WTF are you talking about disinflationary?? that term specifically is based off purchasing power. so what the hell are you talking about?


Okay it never was disinflationary, as I just described. but even if we play pretend like you do to try to line your pockets, why does 2140 need a different monetary policy than we do currently and how can you possibly know that they no longer need "disinflationary" (wink wink) currency?
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:07:41

you disappeared.
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:17:03
Nice change of topic.  More like you were wrong, you realized it, and rather than just admit it you ran off.  Disinflationary is tied directly to purchasing power of goods and services, as the definition specifies.  Therefore, bitcoin is not disinflationary.  Just admit it bro.  Why are you waxing philospical and trying to grab some moral high ground by wishing me well and shit?  Just admit youre wrong.

As people already explained a thousand times in this thread, theft is banned but it can still happen.
If crypto gets banned then 99.999% of the greater fool pool gets shutdown.  Then the pyramid scheme is over and noone in the public gives a shit about it anymore.  Just criminals and police.

You did.  But your talking to crypto people .  Not exactly the cream of the crop.  So don't be disappointed when they don't understand that they were wrong.

Uhhh what are you talking about?  They ban shit in the us all the time and it works fine.  They banned air conditioners under 13 seer efficiency.  That works.  They banned asbestos in building materials. That works.  They banned pyramid schemes, they cut way back on their existence in the us.  Bans work all the time
You aren't very bright are you?  What's your career?

Okay your tone was ridiculous and everything digital is a string of 0 and 1s and there is plenty of shit you ain't allowed to have, so spare me the flowery speech.
As people figure out that blockchain sucks and cryptos are just a modern pyramid scheme, they will be banned.  The constitution doesn't gaurantee your right to hold pyramid tokens.  Or any strings of numbers.  That's ridiculous.  It literally doesn't say that. At all.

Nope.  They really can ban you from owning many things on a computer, ALL of which are 1s and 0s.  That's not protected by the first amendment.  You are just making up crap, you sound like a tinfoil internet kid.
