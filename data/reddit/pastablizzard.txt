"Refuse to increase the amount of masternodes it mixes through" what do you mean? At the moment you can do 8 rounds of mixing in gui, soon to be 16. You can already do 16 in cli and if you wanted you could recompile with no limit and do an infinite number of rounds, and an infinite number of MNs

Controlling half of them would be quite difficult to accomplish... Even then that wouldnt hardly break all mixing, especially 8 or above rounds.

What kind of information could be shared? To my knowledge ip is anonymized over tor and the inputs / outputs are seperated as to not be linkable by a MN.
If you ignore that or if I'm wrong you still have to realize the economic implications. In order to reliably break 8 round mixes, you would need an astronical number of MNs. Why would you sabotage your own investment when you have hundreds of millions invested?

Can you explain the math / logic behind that or point me in a direction?

I've studied traditional crypto functions a lot, and they use primes and prime factorization. Instead of your example it's more like 7*13 is easy but getting the factors of 91 is a lot harder, and you basically have to search through the primes, with some optimizations. Same as how you explained zkps (zero knowledge proofs) as being a one way function. So how is it then that you can't say brute force a zkp? And assuming the increase in computation speed and better algorithms being found, potentially breaking old xmr private transactions.

Dash's privacy completes it's goal, to maintain fungibility. That's what's important to me. 
Plus I like how it is secured by statistics. Sha-1 broken, md5 broken, so many algorithms have been broken. What happens if xmr's cryptographic functions get broken and all of the private txs get exposed retroactivly? I know it's a little different due to zero knowledge proofs etc... But I wouldn't put it past the security and hacking community.
