Congrats, I hope you get a few more!

And in true ripoff fashion should we use doge as the downvote?
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:58:01
Awesome, now we can flood the market and get this unlimited alts phase over faster. The every man and his coin phenomenon is just hurting the public perception of cryptocurrency

Connect the phone with USB in mass storage mode. Download testdisk and run photorec on the drive!
@_date: 2014-04-26 11:55:15
But LiNux us for geeks hurrrdurrr. No seriously have a live distro on a USB and use it for transactions
@_date: 2014-04-11 11:45:49
No, wait, huh? Oh yeah...
@_date: 2013-08-23 12:28:58
That's why I think bitcoin is only the start for crypto, there will be a crypto that deals with the blockchain issue along the road somewhere. I really don't like the "storage is growing faster than the blockchain" perspective, think of the number of transactions when bitcoin hits mainstream, it will be phenomenal.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:46:05
The trouble at the moment is you can't get usd out of gox, therefore btc is at a premium due to it being the only reasonable exit point. Sure, sell your btc on gox but you will be waiting 4-6weeks for sepa or hold the fiat there and buy again if/when the price drops.
@_date: 2013-06-21 11:43:49
Damn, oh well at least I used a rubbish password that I haven't used before.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:37:07
I don't think they will die, think of the volume if trade on gox and the fees for each transaction. 5m is not an absurd amount of money in that perspective. It is the legal hoops that are causing issues, not the amount of funds seized.
@_date: 2013-10-17 10:41:35
I added that to my website too :) ozwinches.com
@_date: 2013-05-15 05:10:32
I'm trying to accept bitcoin on my site and would like a better payment system than this. Any help would be appreciated.
@_date: 2013-05-24 08:40:04
As soon as you crowd fund a toll-free major highway come back to me about how all taxes are bad
@_date: 2013-05-21 04:04:18
You still did a great job and I thank you for it. For those of us on other continents, it was a massive help. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 06:29:49
But where is to the moon guy? He should have been here by now.
@_date: 2013-08-23 12:25:41
In my opinion bitcoin is only the seed for cryptocurrency, I don't think it will be the final crypto used universally. Having said that, we will all be dead and buried by the time the final block is found.

Good work, you've got a lot of work to do here trying to repair the damage being done by dodgy people.
@_date: 2013-10-20 13:22:38
* for USD, everyone else go for it.
@_date: 2013-10-04 15:52:54
Why does it matter where an exchange is held? plus 0.8% fees? no thanks.
@_date: 2013-10-29 06:28:29
WordPress, woocommerce and bitcoin plugin for woocommerce. :) check out ozwinches.com as my basic example.
@_date: 2013-06-20 11:49:27
Found it: 
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:26:08
You won't get into bitcoin for that price if you want anything back. The money for small fish is in the alternate coins and selling them for bitcoin on an exchange. For $300 buy an amd 79xx graphics card for your pc and mine scrypt coins with that. Go to coinwarz.com for a comparison with your hardware. Good luck and welcome.

So we were waiting for him to pull out?
@_date: 2013-08-08 07:58:45
So pretty much like any other merchant :)
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:41:30
You wouldn't be able to mine btc, you would need to mine alts and trade them for btc  on an exchange. You would also need to find a good exit strategy for your fiat to pay the power bill. Yes the power bill will go up a lot and you would need to tend to the machines a lot.
@_date: 2013-10-12 23:04:24
This is what I don't understand, USD is having issues due to the red tape but the other currencies are fine. Why are people not putting a little effort into getting out of gox with another currency then exchanging into USD elsewhere? I have no experience in this, has someone tried it?
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:55:23
Wow amazing post, I'll definitely work through this, Cheers!
@_date: 2013-08-23 12:41:05
Try to keep an logical perspective when prepping, you aren't prepping for doomsday. You are prepping for 6 months without a job, a week without power etc. Leave the doomsday, zombie, meteor hype to the crazies. Turn the power and water off to your house over the weekend and see how you cope. Note down what you struggle with and move on from there. If something was big enough to knock out enough of the internet and effect bitcoin, you have a lot more to worry about. Good luck and welcome to both crypto and prepping :)

Who are you using for hosting? if they have cpanel then you have access to simple deployment using fantastico or similar. Godaddy also has a one click deployment. If you are self hosting or VPS without an admin panel then you will have to follow a tutorial to install wordpress (or any other CMS really). Once wordpress is up and running the plugin repository is as simple as using an app store. You should be able to get most things done without getting down and editing php.

It's back up
@_date: 2013-10-20 20:46:02
Thanks for that, my apologies OP.
@_date: 2013-08-17 04:06:15
Wasn't very subtle was it...
@_date: 2013-06-21 11:41:29
Look out for me bud, I'll be on there. Nice looking forum by the way.
@_date: 2013-06-19 04:25:05
They did pretty well covering bitcoin too!
@_date: 2013-08-30 00:07:44
Did people actually read your comment? or did they just see "imaginary" out of the corner of their eye and downvote.
@_date: 2013-05-21 01:46:45
This guy recorded the whole thing and has been putting them up all weekend 
@_date: 2013-05-15 05:35:30
Thanks, I'll have a look into it!
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:31:20
Yeah I'm getting 520's on both API and web

I have used omnicoins.com.au a few times and they are great so far.
@_date: 2013-10-13 22:32:15
Do you need a hockey mask to withdraw from an atm?
Edit: ok to be serious no, unless you plan on using bitcoin for illegal actions then hiding your identity is not necessary. Most of us just use it as online cash, tor is not required to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-17 03:53:13
The block is the needle in the haystack you are all looking for and contains a chunk of bitcoins, you have been given a small part of the haystack to look at, if you are getting "stales" the The block was found before you finished looking through your piece of the haystack. Give it some time to get the info stable, the info on the site is delayed a while. Check you stats on the computer and make sure you aren't getting hardware errors or stales, if so you need to alter your settings. Good luck :)

In the last episode of Plan B (there is a fantastic quote on why bitcoin is important and why it exists. I would love to get this out there. (sorry it's a little late and I'm a little tipsy. I've forgotten the guys name)
@_date: 2013-06-27 05:04:35
Have you tried btc-e? It's fast, good api and has the trollbox
