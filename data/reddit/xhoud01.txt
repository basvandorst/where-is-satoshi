I met him in SF 2013 at the  first bitcoin conference in US.  Bastard at the first sight

True but from merchants point of view winners charge 1% but for example bitcoinpay 0.8 % and is approx third best in terms of exchange rates. Every processor offers different features like splits, overpayments, underpayments, invoice expiry time. Etc

I am also withdrawing all from stamp. Stupid decission it only brings more paperwork for them
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:53:32
Try bitcoinpay.com if you are not from us. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:34:21
Coinmate.io also blocks all us citizens
@_date: 2016-09-25 19:37:20
Buying bitcoins with usd is usually more expensive than with eur. Try kraken.com coinmate.io or bitstamp.net all super exchangers with low funding fees
@_date: 2016-09-26 11:19:13
One of the best is missing. Coinmate.io
@_date: 2016-09-25 19:43:44
I personally like [coinmate.io](
@_date: 2015-09-24 21:40:15
What about bitcoinpay.com
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:47:24
They are running out of investors money. Bitcoin is too small and they can not grow anymore. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 06:35:20
What co.pany can create such beautiful videos?
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:05:35
@_date: 2013-08-08 20:52:27
Yep mtgox will hardly be what it used to be. You can also send it to dagensia.eu they are licensed and solid
@_date: 2016-07-11 23:46:22
I cant believe they have chosen BitPay (spy agent !). There are better alternatives  in Erope :-( So sad.
@_date: 2013-08-18 16:06:09
Business that is unable to cashout fiat money is in fact dead.
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:49:21
@_date: 2013-08-28 21:47:28
Dagensia is also fine. Supervised by eu regulators
@_date: 2013-08-18 07:39:40
Because you can not withdraw money from mtgox. So when you want to withdraw you need to convert your balance in btc and those transfer to bitstamp. Thats why the gap. I honestly thing bitstamp.net is next one who will impose big hit from banksters. They publicly do not obey eu legislation aml procedures etc. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 11:31:54
Never do that. They might to steal your identity. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 17:03:22
Is it fake stamp or not? I do not believe it is an official stamp. Where can I get it?
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:30:22
It is not scam. Good service can only  recommend
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:01:11
Add [dagensia.eu]( a licensed bitcoin exchange inEurope
@_date: 2013-09-21 09:01:08
Don't send usd. Send eur wires.  Us wiyh their restrictions only kill themselves.  Try dagensia.eu godd service with many loading options for eu customers
@_date: 2013-09-18 21:47:59
It is very expensive.  So sad
@_date: 2013-08-18 07:36:13
Or you can try [dagensia.eu] ( they are licensed and provide some instant funding methods. It not classic market maker but more or less service similar to coinbase.com
@_date: 2013-10-19 19:35:16
 dagensia.eu.  it is not an exchange. But if you send eur you deal with eur. WWhich saves you conversion at bitstamp. They take your sepa change eur to usd and than take a trading fee. f you are from eu try dagensia they are regulated.
@_date: 2013-09-07 08:02:58
A [dagensia.eu]( is also fine. It is not a classic market but they offer instant funding EUR SEPA and via ecurrencies. The only negative is their verification and the fact their service is limited to Eu countries. But they are licensed and fair.
@_date: 2013-08-18 07:46:35
Maybe we should sue them. This is an unbelievable rip off for all their customers. Such a shady practice.  Someone from us should contact some  consumer protection association and shut their unfair business practices. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:40:55
Dagensia.eu very good services
