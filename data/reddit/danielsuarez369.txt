Unfortunately this is the case. Just don't store large amounts of Bitcoins in their wallet. I recommend as many others have to use a hardware to handle transactions. Since there's countless reports of Coinbase constantly freezing accounts randomly

This. So far Coinbase haven't let me down when it comes to selling bitcoins and sending the money to my PayPal balance(Even though j don't trust them... The countless reports of them cancelling orders and suspending accounts is terrifying).

Is a 5megabit down and a 50kilobyte up connection enough for a S9 to run without a bottleneck?

If you're interested in small profit you don't need "millions" you should start out with at least one antminer S9

How is coinbase a scam? I've had no problems with it so far having small amounts of money in the Bitcoin wallet they provide... I've seen some cases of them delaying transactions but normally they're solved and the customer who suffered is normally offered some kind of redemption... Is coinbase safe to store large amounts of money though?

Do you consider "anycoin direct" a good alternative for selling bitcoins?

Launch price? Already ridiculous tho a price is supposed to drop it price after launch.. anybody in the past would assume a year after launch you could get a GTX 1080 for $400
