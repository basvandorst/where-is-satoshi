More like LBC needs to work on getting regulatory approval to have sellers (this doesn't affect buyers at all) operate in each state... same challenges uber is facing. People need to understand that bitcoin is not fucking magic. We do not live in a utopia of free trade and consumers still need government protection. Does the government abuse that relationship to overreach? Absolutely. Its a constant struggle. But thinking that we can have a bunch of people running around making transactions with zero oversight IN THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY is beyond immature. I believe in technology and its ability to solve a lot of these problems. But in the mean time... we need the government.

no, i meant the "concept of airbnb with companies that have shared renting of properties in all countrys allowing customers to live in any location in the world for a flat rate for any period" are you talking about making a flat monthly fee for rentals all over the world? cause i can't imagine that would take off as a lifestyle choice. why would u want to move around so much? sure a business model could allow for it i guess, but there are many more reasons people stay in one place beyond economics (friends/family, possessions, home modifications, etc). traveling is great, but not so much that you would need a flat rate.

EXACTLY! im actually happy to see companies forced into a multisig structure of not holding peoples money. The truth is they are simply not qualified to, and have proven this over and over by loosing said money. If you want to hold customers money you SHOULD be regulated. its for the consumers protection. The beauty of bitcoin is that there are other (better) ways of operating where you never have to control other peoples money. Its just easier to setup centralized systems first, but now hopefully this will put pressure on the industry to move forward.

not the reporting, the markets themselves, and the possibilities to game markets and collude. I guess the free market purists would argue that it is at ur own risk, but it seems like there would be a lot of corruption in manipulating the outcomes of the things people were betting on in an open unregulated platform like this. Plus this could enable some pretty interesting or terrible incentives. I remember reading about one pm that had issues with markets betting on whether someone would be killed or not, essentially acting as assassination incentives.
Not that any of this is a reason this shouldn't exist. My general view is if its possible its going to be made anyway, so better to accept, embrace, and adapt. But interesting to consider. I could see some silkroad-esque headlines in augurs future.

He is such an amazing orator, and im sure the film could have benefited from adding his voice.

thats actually a great question. This is one of the things that i am really looking forward to that bitcoin will enable. Micro tipping for anything... like really small stuff like this.

Once cryptos become ubiquitous we are totally going to see a lot of this type of activity, and its going to encourage a higher quality of.... the internet. 500 bits is nothing to give, but people that are really helpful on forums and post great things will start to see real incentive to continue and it will encourage a lot of great content.

This regulatory culture we have is going to get so warped over the next decade.... how do you impose economic sanctions on foreign nations when they can just switch over to bitcoin. What is the point of all these gun control debates when in a few years, after the proliferation of 3d printers, anyone can just print up a fully automatic rifle in the comfort of their own home. And what chance does the government have in the "war on drugs" when these decentralized "dark markets" make buying illicit goods as easy as ripping mp3's?
@_date: 2014-05-02 02:21:04
ur assuming that current tactics (make an example of a small subset with such harsh sanctions as to scare the shit out of everyone else) will continue to work. Im contesting that they wont when monetary anonymity is so ubiquitous. I would argue with your assessment that we "have that right now". Perhaps the 1% has access to caymen banks, and an even smaller fraction of people may deal in cash only businesses, or buy gold in pawnshops as someone else mentioned, but these examples are hardly the norm. with bitcoin, this issue goes mainstream VERY quickly. Yes i think they will fight back in the short term using everything in their old world playbook, but i believe that effort will be as short lived and about as successful as the war on piracy.

Web devs are one thing (and I actually know a lot of them - my brother owns a sw company) but finding one that is capable of working with this new blockchain tech is another. This wouldn't be an issue for me if all I needed was a dev. But I'm looking for one that is familiar with bitcoin (and if I was insanely lucky one that was familiar with Open Transactions, but I’m not holding my breath for that). As for the idea. of course I’m not going to say what it is here. Someone will steal it. This is a brand new field, and very simple ideas can have a massive impact. My idea is very simple, and honestly its one that I think someone will probably come up with eventually (but as far as I can tell no one has come close to this yet). The only thing I can say is that this will be a consumer product. This won't be something in the back pages of bitcointalk (if successful) it will be all over social media and used by people that need not have ANY understanding of bitcoin whatsoever.

what r u on about? bitcoin doesn't have "Core Principles", its just math dude. As for your libertarian "fuck all-yall" rant, im with you. Bitcoin can totally help people keep their private shit private, keep unnecessary middlemen away, and guarantee no one can touch your money. But it can do way more things than that.
Like if someone wants to pay a negligible (to that person anyway) fee for someone else to manage their money for them and they don't care if anyone spies on them personally, i dont see the problem. I'm not advocating these regulatory measures be imposed on all bitcoin transactions btw, just imagine bitcoin like a giant ocean, and on a few of the islands, circle island and coinbase island, there are certain regulations, but then there are all these other islands with totally different rules and no one is forcing you to go to coinbase island, but some people like it there because all the mcdonalds on the island serve hash browns. Like even if its after 10 AM. And because they don't mind the rules (on an individual level while also subconsciously being aware that these rules might not be good if they were applied to every island in the ocean). Point is bitcoin is a protocol with many many uses. 
And as for your rant about how we all HAVE to manage our own money... why? My dry cleaners wash my clothes, my mechanic maintains my car, my gardener mows my lawn, my lawyer keeps me out of jail, and my woman takes care of the sandwiches.... whats wrong with letting circle handle my bits?

I hear the same whining from music creators all the time, but the thing that non of you want to admit is that your content really isn't worth that much anymore. When music or internet content was scarce, SURE u could charge a premium. But this business of charging for digital media is a new thing to begin with. Musicians were still making music long before they could record it and tho they didn't make as much as when the internet first started taking off, they still managed with proceeds from concerts/merch etc. 
Now with the proliferation of digital content, when news doesn't just come from the cnn's of the world, but any blogger with a mac book, Your "amazing" website is competing in such an oversaturated market that it truly is BARELY worth the cost of hosting it. Thats not our faults its just supply and demand. The fact that your not getting donations equal to what advertisers used to pay to spackle your site with garbage is not a representation of "cheap" users, but more of an indicator that your content is no longer worth what you think it is.
And before you go and think this is a bad thing, remember that there are still PLENTY of websites that DO offer distinct desirable content that is in such high demand that they can make plenty of money (either from ads or donations)
TLDR; if its really worth something ull get paid for it.

idk, i think ur thinking about this the wrong way. U dont need to "convince" anyone to use buy bitcoin. This is not a product that needs to be marketed by holders. Obviously we all want everyone to buy in and make our early investment skyrocket immediately, but that will only happen once the infrastructure is in place. Don't get me wrong, you should educate the people u care about and ull be able to convince a few close people to put a few shekels in, and hopefully they will name their future children after you, but in the mean time, ur only convincing people to speculate with you because there really is no good reason to HOLD BTC right now. I think in about 18 months that will change. But in the mean time there really is no reason to try to get people on board unless they are someone u care about and dont want to miss out on the opportunity, but otherwise, bitcoin should be seen by all as a 2-5 year investment, and dont sweat the user adoption/crazy price swings in the mean time.

in the case of things like the trezor or piper wallets, im not talking about malicious software, im talking about malicious hardware. As far as opening the device up... well that COULD work (and i would actually like to see manufacturers consider making this an actually recommended step and make it easy to do) but that would require there to be a very simple method for non techies to look at a diagram of expected hardware, and match it up, and would also require that there is no way to design some kind of hidden hardware that a lay person wouldn't be able to detect. And that is basically my overall question... is it **impossible** for the manufacturer to dupe us if they wanted to?
@_date: 2014-09-09 19:41:23
this is all well and good (and probably one of the most well thought out and robust security systems for bitcoin iv seen), but i still dont see how it protects against the trezor manufacturers themselves being malicious. I'm not an engineer, so maybe this isn't really possible, but if the nsa can intercept ups packages of routers and install surveillance chips and then pass them along, couldn't the trezor manufacturers do the same? This is from that article u posted:


But what if they just didn't do that for a few of the devices and installed something that COULD track all your info and send it back out to them? It just seems like the one vulnerability to any device made specifically for bitcoin is that some bad actor maybe involved in the actual manufacturing of it, rendering any further security measures obsolete.

less than 10% of the worlds currency is in cash... thats hardly enough to "overwhelm" the irs. Bitcoin is FAR more useful and has the potential to eclipse that (im talking M0 here not fiat... although.... lol). But more importantly, currently, the solution to tax evasion is to HIDE your wealth, as you've said. And in doing so you inevitably expose yourself to several points of weakness. If at any time any of your cash came from someplace with a digital signature you can be audited, and so on. What i am talking about is a paradigm in which a majority of the worlds money supply is BY DEFAULT anonymous. The point being that (if bitcoin continues on its current path) it will one day be completely reasonable for large groups of people to deal SOLELY in bitcoin. I can't imagine any substantial amount of people dealing solely in cash without any exposure to banks, or anything else that may track them. The idea of "voluntary" taxation becomes very questionable when enough people have such powerful tools of monetary anonymity.

im giving the example of robocoin to show how this is an issue that currently exists as bitcoin is now. Meaning that even with the regulation of fiat, ur still free from oversight the second u go digital. As for other forms of income... sure they do exist right now, but none of them (not even cash) is as potentially ubiquitous as bitcoin. So sure, there are ways to get around tax laws currently, but they are so small, and ultimately available to so few, that there is no threat to this current "voluntary" system you've outlined. My question is: what happens when anonymity is at the fingertips of every single person with money? The sheer volume of people that would not "volunteer" would make it completely irrelevant what the irs "believes".

Maybe there isn't anything particularly malicious about the service, but its the absolute wrong idea if this actually took off on scale. Have we learned nothing from gox? giving others the control of our money in exchange for convenience was stupid... giving up control for risk protection maybe less stupid, but ONLY in small amounts. 
Sure theres lots of places that need to pool our money (cloud wallets, exchanges, etc) but the general consensus is that this is all a temporary necessity and tools are on the way to fix this (multisig, decentralized exchanges, etc). With bitreserve that is not the case. they will always keep control of the money.
Maybe if this was presented in that way i would be less annoyed, but this guy is acting like cesar marching into rome, with shit we never asked for, telling us its everything we never knew we needed.

yeah, basically protoshares (pts) is based on a social contract that all holders of pts (and ags (angel shares) which are the same as pts except they cant be transferred (short explanation)) will recieve 20% of all DAC's that invictus creates. Bitshares X (currently called Bitshares XT while in test phase) is the first (?) DAC so all PTS holders on August 28th (the "snapshot date") will be awarded about 1.3 BTS for every 1 PTS in their wallet. But you have to have the private keys. Obviously this creates a problem for exchanges or any other hosted solution where u dont actually hold the private keys for your crypto. So if you have PTS on cryptsy for example on the 28th, THEY will get the free BTS that you are entitled to. So you need to move the PTS to your own private wallet. Bter however has announced that they will honor the split, so basically they are giving their word that they will receive the free BTS and then give it back to anyone who held PTS on their platform at the time. Its a classy move

Circle seems to be a great product, but its so similar to coinbase and even falls short on some pretty big features (vault), that im starting to think some of these bi-daily identical "I personally think Circle is Incredible! and im never looking back at Coinbase" posts might be an organized shill campaign from circle, and i hope im wrong cause i really want both these companies to succeed.

Thats right... please save us from this short term volatility. In return we will totally give up all the benefits of holding a deflationary currency and not only that, but we'll also hand over all our money to u guys to hang on to, and give up all this decentralized nonsense (Its not like any of that was really that important to us, we just wanted a fast way to move money around). thats totally a fair trade for shielding us from all this nasty upward volatility.

Very cool! 
Your use of fiat does seem counterintuitive though. Not that there is anything wrong with it, at this stage its probably even a better solution than BTC (mainly because of the size of the userbase). I'm surprised because i would imagine it would be WAY easier to implement this through bitcoin, than to deal with all the regulatory issues holding fiat in escrow would bring, especially for a "small team with no outside funding". 
But very cool work in any case, hope it all works out for you guys!
I will say one thing though... Just my 2 bits, but i hope you'll have options other than a recurring payment, or a mandatory monthly fee. I think that will turn a lot of potential users away that might still be willing to participate in a pay as you go a la carte system.

I was just explaining this exact thing to a friend today... its infuriating how many people dont see how obvious some of these are. Its like some poor dad asks for some advice for how to make $10 stretch for a week for his 3 month old that he cares for alone cause his wife died of cancer and the medical bills crushed him and all he wants is to do right by his kid.... a bunch of people get awesome and make it rain on this unsuspecting single father and the world is a better place for a few minutes.......... then an army of bottom feeding leaches crawl out of the woodwork with similar tales and an aww shucks attitude and people just throw money at them without so much as a username check.... its fucking embarrassing... we are supposed to be the smart ones in the room.

What is this obsession with getting everyone into bitcoin the "right" way.... were we all like "We need to educate the masses on DOS... STOP TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT WINDOWS!"
Personally i can't wait for the day that a "private key" is something that only 5% of btc holders even remember, because THAT will be when this thing actually takes off. Hell, I want to see chase bank offer me a btc account. Why not? I'll gladly pay a little extra for the peace of mind that my lifes savings is secured and insured.

imo the point of alt coins isnt to set up a backup network in case bitcoin collapses... thats a pretty weak reason to invest in another protocol. The reason for alts is to develop features that aren't possible for bitcoin. Once those features are properly implemented in side chains i cant see anyone bothering with another alt that has the same features. For example... lets say someone came out w bitcoin backup (BTB) an identical coin to BTC in every way, except for the fact that it has its own blockchain... do u really think anyone would adopt this coin that is identical in every feature, yet weaker in security and network effect JUST in case BTC goes down?
I do think a couple alts WILL stick around, but they will have to offer something that is fundamentally impossible on the bitcoin chain (like proof of stake or something)

I am 29 years old... I have never, not once in my life, ever "trolled". This is one of the most retarded aspects of the internet that makes me wish there was a way to add ages to all usernames online, because I am certain that 99% of it is from children. I am not speaking to get a negative reaction from you, and further more im just right. Apple makes a shit ton of money from itunes, and a simplified universal payment system undermines their ability to funnel consumer purchases through itunes. This is not opinion, or a theory... it is a very simple to understand fact. I dont care about ur moronic brand loyalties, and i have no agenda against apple... This just is what it is

NO! u r wrong and alien is correct! this is my problem with all u single track minded finance guys. u simply dont get it... u look at this like its any other tech stock. ITS NOT! this is not some stock that u pick up and if it doesn't perform u drop it. If that is what u r looking for u have no business buying bitcoin. U buy bitcoin if u understand that this technology will change the world. And then u do so understanding that IT IS NOT READY YET! ur buying 1 of 21 million teleportation devices that will ever be created but ur doing it 3 years before anyone else will have one. Ur doing this because u understand that when everyone else gets one... THIS SHIT WILL BE HUGE!... or maybe some other company will design a better one and urs will be worthless. Either way, ur "investment" is simply irrelevant until the infrastructure is built. But all this talk about having sympathy for the guy that invested at 1k and is now faced with the tough decision of cutting their losses or potentially loosing it all is complete nonsense! i have no sympathy for any idiot that bought at 1k and is selling for 350. they just didn't know what they were doing and deserved the loss. u dont "invest" in beta tech this way. u put down whatever u can afford to loose, and then WAIT UNTIL THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS BUILT. Bitcoin will either go to a million or zero... there is no in between. thats a pretty good risk reward in my book, but once ur in, dont even bother looking at the price for now. its just stupid

Seriously dude... i have no problem with u stating something u think is the biggest problem with bitcoin... but this is just the beginning of some MAJOR innovation... give the devs some time. After seeing how far they have come and the solutions to some of the earlier issues, i have a LOT of faith in the people in this field, and that these are things that can and will be worked out.

ok, im going to ignore ur grammar requests because i just dont care enough to take the time. if u were someone important, or this was a business email, i would, but this is reddit, and i am talking to someone named slut buster, so either deal with it or move on. 
As for your argument... no, it is u who has missed the point. u mentioned square and paypal. y do u think they allow those and not bitcoin. do u think they are just stupid? evil? dont understand what bitcoin is? This is deliberate man! Bitcoin is bad for apple. Apple has created a massively successful funnel for digital content and has packaged it all up under one payment platform. It is a centralized system that offers users the incredible ease of a user experience in which they can store one credit card with a trusted company and get all the digital content they can download. Bitcoin is MASSIVELY disruptive to this model. As it matures, u will be able to hop around the internet and buy anything u want from any website with the click of a button seamlessly. It wont break itunes over night cause payment is only half the battle, creating popular distributed channels of content with equal amounts of inventory is still a necessity, but once those two things are in place, itunes will face a threat far greater than amazon, google, or any other centralized competitor. 
If you agree with all that, then why would they do ANYTHING to grant it any kind of legitimacy. As far as apple is concerned, they are keeping the app off like 40% of all smartphones and that will have a negative effect on bitcoin (no matter how small). Basically everything they can possibly do to discourage it they will... they are incentivised to behave this way. its not rocket science. doesnt matter if its an app, a web portal, or an advertisement, they will literally block as much of it as they can get away with until it starts to cost them more in lost sales

Not a programmer, so i can't build any of these, but as soon as bitcoin makes me rich, the first thing ill do is hire a team out of pocket to build 2 amazing btc ideas that iv been thinking of for the past 8 years. 
But heres a couple throw aways that i like, but will probably never do myself. 
* 1) uAd - This is a weird idea, but i think it would be cool to have a website that has a list of ad space all around the world (everything from billboards, to web banners), and then let users post things they want printed to those spaces. This would generally be for everything EXCEPT ads (though i imagine there will be plenty of ads as well). But the focus would be on putting up things like news headlines that aren't getting enough attention, or a meme, or a political rant, or an invitation to prom, or basically ANYTHING people want others to see. Then the ideas can be crowd funded, or paid in full by the OP till it reaches whatever the rate is for the space. (imagine a crowd funded "legalize marijuana" ad in time square) I think this WILL actually be used a lot for "micro" ads as well. Think of a small business owner that has never even bothered to look up what it costs to advertise their business, but can now look up the exact spot they want, and see the price right on the site. Payments can be done in cryptos, or u can go hardcore and decentralize the whole thing, putting ads in the blockchain, and then creating a rating system for the people that sell the ad space (really just for making sure that the ad was posted for the agreed amount of time). I can go on, but i think u get the jist.
* 2) (more specifically in the field) Build a ticketmaster DAC through bitshares. This is inevitable, but the hard part will be pulling venues from the iron grip of ticketmaster

no the point for merchants is exactly what you said. Very little cost to integrating it, and TONS of free publicity. Maybe even a little extra business from loyal btc supporters and the lower fees from dealing with them, but thats probably just gravy (tho it def has helped some of the earlier guys more than others - look at overstocks numbers). Thats not to say that they are pro or anti bitcoin, it just doesn't matter to them when all those other incentives line up. But whatever their motivation is, in the end we still all benefit from this synergy.

I will say the documentary (as its title implies) is very pro bitcoin. But being outrageously pro bitcoin myself that wasn't really an issue for me. And i dont really blame the director for the lack of dissent because honestly the only time i ever hear people publicly dispute bitcoin anymore is when they are doing so on an unopposed platform. But other than that the movie was very entertaining. It was a pretty inclusive summary of all the major events of the last 4 years. Especially charlie shrems story, as he was one of the main characters as well as one of the panel members. 
That was another cool part of going to the opening... it was cool to see all these people that iv been reading about for years in person. 
The panel was unfortunately not that cool at all. Shrem was really the only interesting person on it, and they just asked a few boring questions. They really should have at least opened it up for audience questions. but whatever.

does bitpay actually keep any btc themselves?  i know they offer merchants the ability to exchange immediately but do they keep any for themselves? If so, they (and coinbase) should setup all their merchants to be bitcoin stores as well. Let all customers buy actual btc in the stores. Maybe even design a special printer that hides qr codes so they could even give out paper btc to customers. that would be the best mass distribution model imo if someone could get around the volatility of pre buying bulk btc (which i think they already do right?). Imagine if every bitpay customer was also a btc distribution center.

Yes, and this existing paradigm is why i never really considered what it would be like if the irs lost "control". but in a world where hiding your money was not only easy and COMPLETELY full proof, but so many people were doing it that it makes regulation impossible... then what? Im obviously drawing from parallels in digital content. I dont think 30 years ago, you could have convinced anyone that "stealing" music would one day be so easy and guaranteed to be untraceable that anyone could do it, but moreover that even in those early days when the incumbents were actually fighting back (similar scare tactics - individual kids facing hundreds of thousands of dollar lawsuits for an hour of downloading so as to be made an example of) they were still simply overwhelmed.
The bottom line is that if enough people do it, it becomes unreasonable to regulate it. And i really believe if the tools make it that easy and remove the risks (ala tor/dark wallet) there will be enough people.

@_date: 2014-09-16 20:56:24
But your doing it again... this is NOT an alt coin. The claims that bitshares makes about DPOS being better than POW may be true... FOR BITSHARES. But again, that is because bitshares (and im lumping a lot of different products here but it still holds) is not a "coin". The bitshares products are for-profit companies. If you look at it like that its obvious why they have such a problem with the wasteful practices of POW. The reason DPOS is (imo) NOT good for bitcoin is because global "money" should not be a for-profit company. And the method of distribution to a non-invested 3rd party (miners) is FAR more elegantly incentivised and fair for something that is supposed to just be "money" (again, imo anyway)

Open Transactions solves all these problems.... trustless escrow (via voting pools or lex cryptographia) and anonymous transactions.

@_date: 2015-05-21 22:56:46
ok, well i guess i didn't explicitly say this, but i when i said it was pointless to use private blockchains, i meant the use of the ledger (for data management). I do think there could **potentially** be use cases for entirely alternate currencies, with different economic structures and rules, on entirely different block chains, though i haven't seen one yet (most of the benefits from alt-coins could just be added to sidechains). 
As for your example of a "bank-coin"... no, i think that would be a terrible idea. Bankers are literally the last people on earth i want in control of the national monetary system. Reducing the number of nodes to a handful of banks would remove any semblance of security from the system. The only way the dollar goes digital is if the government maintains the system, and again they would use a completely different method than the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:47:35
can everyone please stop comparing intranets to private blockchains?! Think about it for more than 10 seconds and it makes zero sense. The whole point of the blockchain is to provide immutable publicly auditable records... in a private blockchain (mined by one entity) That no longer exists. There is no reason to use one... its basically the equivalent of having a password protected spreadsheet. why would anyone program that into a blockchain?

HAHA dude. im sorry, i didn't really mean anything negative about any of it... i was just hoping the panel would have been... more. I was looking for some more in depth discussion of philosophical views on the future of bitcoin, the implications for technology, economics, and politics but ultimately i guess this really wasn't the forum for that so i do understand why the scope was somewhat... limited. 
And like i said before, you were the only one on the panel that i would really care to listen to anyway. (nothing against the other 2, its just that their involvement in bitcoin has been no where near the level of yours) I saw erik voorhees and jered kenna there as well, i wish the panel was just those two and u lol.... but i guess this needed to remain about the movie, lol.

@_date: 2015-05-21 21:05:26
i dont even know where to begin.... i think ur just trying to see if something u understand could solve any possible hypothetical, but bitcoin is not the solution for standard database management. There is no reason to try and shoehorn it in where it doesn't belong just because it could potentially work. It must be more efficient at solving a problem. Can you name a single example of a situation where you would need consensus from 10 or 100 entities and existing database management solutions won't work (or a blockchain would work better)?

well instead of pooling btc, each user would get 1 of 3 multisig keys, coinbase would get the second, and some kind of 3rd party arbiter would hold the 3rd. The reason coinbase holds it all now is for the users security (as well as /probably/ giving them the ability to profit by make better exchanges, but thats not something we should try to preserve anyway if it does happen). As for traditional exchanges, the principle is the same. all money would be held in various multisig wallets, and then moved to another multisig escrow wallet when put up for a sell order. Granted this does nothing for buy orders... or in other words, does nothing to audit fiat, but thats why i said "at least multisig" in the title. The real challenge with all this is creating a reliable arbiter network. OT and Lex cryptographia seem to be at the forefront of this challenge. Multisig doesn't do much for a traditional exchange, since it only secures crypto's, but if utilized in coinbase it would prove to be a compelling wallet solution for the less technically inclined, and remove the fear that coinbase might take off with ur btc. I think if we get a good crowd sourced arbiter network running soon, that could really be the best all around solution for everyday btc use. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:17:19
and that would be even worse.... the point im making is that bitcoin is not a new way of accounting. it is a very specific properly balanced set of rules that relies on a combination of game theory and incentives. u can't just slap it into another paradigm and expect it to work the same. Again, in the example you gave, there would be nothing trustless about it. You are basically saying that they are using "bank-coin" but just among themselves, and no one in the public can use it, but banks use it to transfer value among themselves... that still doesn't solve the problem of trust. With such a small number of "miners" and no public auditing (two very crucial facets of bitcoin) there are far too many opportunities for corruption. I'm not saying that a better system might not be warranted, im saying that bitcoin isn't it.

ok, **I** am not a troll... im probably as pro bitcoin as it gets and have contributed for years, and i think u/sanswork is absolutely right, and this idea (as presented so far) is the dumbest thing to ever come out of the bitcoin space. Its seriously embarrassing how many people are flocking to 21 like immature sycophants. I'm not saying i think 21 is absolutely doomed or won't come out with anything useful (honestly im actually surprised by this nonsense considering the quality of their staff) but it will not be in the form of anything they have announced so far. The idea of mining devices in consumer products is flat out retarded. There is absolutely no way it does anything valuable for anyone, and if somehow manufacturers are all caught up in this and in 5 years i can't buy a single electronic device without having a miner crammed into it, i will be seriously pissed off. (hardware wallets in every device? sure. But a miner? Hell no) The people advocating this are either just desperate for ANY corporate attention to bitcoin with money signs in their eyes, or simply have zero understanding of mining economics. Some idiot above was literally like "well if i could get a coffee maker for 50 bucks instead of 75, wouldn't it be worth it"   .......!??!!??? this is why people don't take us seriously

meh... i wouldn't. I actually think the company could potentially be very successful. I mean the list of people involved is pretty impressive. Im willing to bet they have quite a bit under their sleeve, i just think this idea of mining devices in every product is nonsense. Plus i think i read somewhere that they came up with that plan like several years ago back when mining wasn't even on gpu's yet, so im willing to bet they have pivoted quite a bit since then and have some other plans they just aren't announcing yet. time will tell, but i wouldn't bet against the company just yet.

I think a lot of confusion with this idea is in the fact that a lot of people don't realize that they don't take garage door security very seriously.... I mean the typical garage door is pretty easy for a serious thief. but replace garage door with something that is easier to  perceive as necessary to secure. take a 100k+ car and think about the cost of the security system... just the cost of replacing one laser cut key might make you realize the value in a free open source app on your phone with enterprise level encryption and unlimited programming potential

I would argue that we are in need of a benevolent dictator at this point. Watching blockstream operate feels like watching Hillary in the US primaries. Not to make this all political, but if you are against Trump, you can't really blame republicans, they got what they wanted... Hillary is the one that lost to a reality tv star. I'm not really sure what side of these size debates im on, I read compelling stuff on all sides, but what i am sure of is that there is MASSIVE social engineering going on and i can't really trust anyone anymore. If blockstream really is right about everything (which is the direction im probably leaning) they absolutely suck at PR. And seem almost delighted to let shit burn as long as they get to say "told ya so" in the end. Personally i think its more important to have one strong blockchain with maybe a couple little compromises than letting this thing get split up a hundred times and make it weak enough for a bank coin to come in and actually compete... the network effect is the best protection against corporate takeover imo, and this is the first time i can actually see a path to it being threatened. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:36:31
Yeah, sorry, hasty analogy. I don't actually mean google should be any kind of dictator in this scenario... I just mean they could be a better voice of reason and trust than any we currently have. And im not just referring to blockstream. I've been wondering lately, for example, if the entire bch fiasco can be traced back to that single theymos post from a couple years ago where he basically said "say what we want you to say or fuck off" (obviously not a direct quote). 
At this point, it's impossible to distinguish amateur incompetence from calculated manipulation anymore. But it is absolutely naive to think that good code is all that matters any more. History is littered with "good code" that never saw the light of day because it couldn't compete with network effect (google+, diaspora, ....esperanto lol). And while im still pretty agnostic about blockstream, its impossible to ignore the fact that they have a pretty glaring conflict of interest. Google would too, I just think they are much better at managing the PR that comes with that, and i think that matters now. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:24:57
I can't accept this as a possibility... the internet itself is another example of one of those decentralized technologies. Bitcoin has so many potential use cases that i can't begin to imagine they don't want to get involved. The more i think about it, the more im convinced that they must be doing *something* but are afraid of causing the kind of major ... turbulence(?) that would result from a company that size even saying the word "bitcoin" out loud. idk, still seems like theres a google sized hole in this project. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:40:39
I'm not asking why google doesn't adopt, or buy bitcoin. I'm asking why they aren't actively involved in its development. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:26:11
yeah, this seems much more plausible. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:52:44
yeah, for sure. I don't mean why don't they add it to mainstream products... My confusion is why they aren't actively involved in its development. Google/google employees contribute a lot to linux and other OSS, you would think they would want to do the same with bitcoin.... I would also expect the fact that these are such early days to be extremely enticing to google. An opportunity to cement themselves as the standard in blockchain tech similar to what they did with gmail back in the day. It just feels strange that there's soooo much more activity coming from the MS camp than from google. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:40:41
I'm not sure why its taking so much effort to convince r/bitcoin users of bitcoin's massive potential (the currency AND the blockchain). I get that google doesn't currently make money with bitcoin... it seems like a strange argument to say THAT is the reason google won't develope all kinds of bitcoin/blockchain tech that changes that reality. Personally im convinced they must be, so therefore they are doing it in private. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:07:54
I guess this is the most popular opinion, and without any better reasoning, i suppose im inclined to agree. I would probably guess its a little more specific... something like all the current android pay negotiations taking place that might be causing the hold up. I could believe that banks would be putting stipulations an any deals they make that say google can't utter the word bitcoin as long as they want visa/amex/etc integration, and maybe for now thats worth more to them than the future potential of bitcoin. This is the only thing i can think of that makes any kind of sense. It just feels like such a massive opportunity to waste for a company as forward thinking/socially dependent as google. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:16:57
If i had to make a bet one way or another, i would definitely put money on this being the case. imo if they aren't actively developing SOMETHING(S) related to bitcoin/blockchain they are passing up on a major opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:01:07
if thats true, its VERY interesting... but im gonna need a source on this one lol
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:59:36
The potential for bitcoin to give google/android pay complete autonomy from banking systems and even deploy new solutions to the unbanked population of the world, along with all the new tech that comes with internet money (micro payments, content tipping, etc) should be way more than enough to counter any losses... but more importantly, its all such early days that they have the opportunity to actually influence this space right now! At this point, i dont believe its possible to "destroy" blockchain tech... though it might still be possible to usurp bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:23:32
its like asking what opportunity google had to invest in email before gmail... bitcoin is a lot more than a single currency. I'm wondering why google isn't actively (and publicly) developing all kinds of blockchain tech. This isn't an experiment any more. There are real examples of crazy disruptive tech that comes from an immutable ledger in the cloud. MS seems to understand this, and i don't for one second think google doesn't know this either... I just think something else is going on here. It's weird that i can barely find anything interesting when googling "bitcoin and google"

WHAT? 
A permissioned centralized ledger can NEVER be as secure as an open decentralized one. The security of a decentralized ledger IS the decentralization. Yes, in either circumstance there are private keys to protect, but in bitcoin, the central target has been removed. Comprising a single user does not threaten the integrity of the whole network, and comprising a single miner does nothing. 
I'm trying to reserve judgement before companies like this actually release products, but unless hyperledger has invented something completely new and unique, the idea of taking bitcoin and just letting a handful of "trusted" entities mine, is beyond ludicrous. Especially since banks are actually the least trustworthy gatekeepers. Whether their intentions are up for debate, their incompetence is not, and banks get hacked constantly. Only in this case hacking one or a few (depending on what rules are in place) institutions could unlock a honeypot of far more money than a single bank would previously have had access to. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:56:03
The waiting list was too long so i signed up for gobutler (though not sure if they take bitcoin), but other than that its basically an exact clone of magic. But honestly, as excited as i was for this. I still have yet to really find an excuse to use them. Living in nyc, i can pretty much already get anything i want online, and while they may take some of the leg work out of time consuming things like finding hotels, flights, etc, I don't really trust them more than my ocd google fu. 
The one thing im hoping is that they have (or eventually get) some better connections at restaurants and can make last minute reservations at places that are fully booked on open table, but i doubt that is currently the case.

You're conflating mining validation and user transactions. Again, I'm (probably naively) hoping there is more to this than we are being told, but if the plan is to just have one or a small handful of miners validating all transactions, then that is the weak link. 
As for "banks could just decide to roll back".... i guess the easiest way to put it would be: what is the point of using any of this architecture to begin with? Satoshi did not invent the database.

It wouldn't... The digital rarity part. The platform agnostic distribution, sure. But thinking u could slap on some kind of Bitcoin-esque drm system to digital media is flawed thinking. The reason digital scarcity exists in btc is cause there is value associated with the network consensus. U could forge bitcoins very easily but the network would reject them, hence, no value. With any kind of digital media the value is in the content itself regardless of the weather it is a copy or not. So no amount of network validation will matter because a copy is just as good as the original.

This isn't to say that we can't learn anything from younger people. And in the issue of xt it is entirely possible that is on the right side... The problem i don't think he recognizes (and this is an issue that i do attribute to his age rather than his intelligence) is that in his brash (and perhaps somewhat immature) decision to create these policies he has distracted from the actual issue and vilified an entire community that could possibly be working in the best interest of the space. Instead of having that conversation this entire forum is now filled with vitriol and outrage over a separate issue that has nothing to do with bitcoin. As someone who used to read almost 80% of the front page of r/bitcoin, its upsetting that i haven't found more than 4 articles interesting enough to click on since this fiasco started... and that is his fault.

paying more for a faster stream is not the problem (and has nothing to do with net neutrality). That already exists now.
