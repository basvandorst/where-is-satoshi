Much appreciated!

Sure, that makes sense on a level. But I'm just trying to correct people who think that them taking their own money out of a bank is going to matter two diddleys to them. My main point I'm trying to get across is: banks make no money on deposits; banks make money on loans. Put your money into the banks, and take your loans out from credit unions. The financial world is goofy and counter-intuitive.

Ah, okay, that elucidates it for me. So it's basically like saying "okay, so apparently below 10 out of 100 was too easy, so the next hash will have to be below 8 out of 100 to close a block out. So start plugging in random nonces until you get lucky and a 7 or less is hashed out."  Is this accurate? Of course I simplified it with the numbers...

That's nice in theory. But I think that's not at all realistic for that to happen.

I'm going to have to second caveden here and say that it is very relevant. Though I think Bitcoin is far superior, if it were subject to the same things Western Union is, the differences wouldn't be a stark.

if it's invested, it's just less liquid. If you've lent your money out, you only have access to it by the terms of the loan. So no, you are not a bank.

Not taking loans out from banks would have an order of magnitude larger impact on the banks. As I said, banks and financial institutions look at money in the opposite way that we do. They don't want it on hand. They want it lent out so they're making money on it. Deposits are just a pain to them. Go ahead and take your money out of the banks if you want to help them out.

When it's said that the hash for a new block must be "below a limit" or threshold (i.e. the difficulty), what does that mean? Isn't the hash a not-so-random but seemingly random string of hex? So what does the hash have to be below? I just don't entirely understand how that all works.

I think it' also relevant to note that financial institutions are kinda flipped upside down in regards to their attitudes towards having money. Having money on hand is a burden for them. They'd much rather lend money out than take your deposits. The National Bank Transfer day orchestrated by some Occupy folks a few years back was idiotic. The credit unions were burdened by the extra deposits. And the banks were none the worse off for the loss of funds. (full disclosure: I was one of those idiots)

His [wikipedia page]( pretty extensively details his views. I've just read and listened to and watched a lot of his stuff. That's mainly where I get my familiarity.
If you just search on youtube for "chomsky anarchism" you'll probably find the video where he describes anarchism in the manner I mentioned.

He identifies himself as a libertarian-socialist, which has its roots in anarchy, which he defines as the innate tendency of humans to challenge and question authority. To simply say he's "a socialist" is largely ignorant of his actual viewpoints.
