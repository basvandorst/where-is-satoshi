i'm talking about second factor, something the user knows (PIN), instead of something the user has (phone

good point. check out 37coins' second factor through dial tone, let me know your opinion.

I don't know about details, but see no possibility without writing some custom code.
I use standard REST calls and a AMQP protocol. feel free to give it a try.
Or save the time and get a 30$ android from ebay.

using a hosted SMS service you could at best create a hosted wallet. Note that 37Coins tries to build a distributed infrastructure with shared responsibility based on multi-sig addresses.

while coinbase requires internet access to set up the initial account and set the sms pin, 37coins can be used with a feature-phone from the beginning on.
The other difference is that coinbase needs a cooperation with the network provider, while 37coins is operated by the people for the people :D

yes, you will pay for every outgoing message under the usual conditions of your contract or prepaid. The intention is to earn this money back with the transaction fee and make a profit. It might be useful to get an sms flat for the gateway operation. Be aware that many providers limit the monthly sms to few hundred or thousand, even though they advertise it as a flat rate. debitel in germany has an unlimited flat. I don't know about UK.

Now it's as simple as creating an account with the website under the "gateway" section and then following the instructions.
I'm looking to simplify it and put all the parts into the android app.

BitFast, love your solution. Also dived into your code a few times already. Let's get things interoperable. I'll send you a pm.

Hi guys,
the backend is a risk management system, activating a second factor if transactions exceed limits or look suspicious. This part is very similar to greenaddress or other risk management services.
Feature phones can not be compromised as easy, but the SMS network is basically like sending an open envelope through mail, making it equally challenging.
The multi-sig is not in place yet because we have special requirements of running Bitcoin code on low-spec android phones. Any help on bitcoinj married wallet implementation is very welcome:

thanks, will do.

sorry for that. you only really need to sign up if you want to operate a gateway. drop me an email in that case. otherwise just pick a number in your country from the front page and send a text to it. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:49:06
good question! don't have an answer yet. I though about an encrypted key backup or 2 of 3 mustisig transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:56:44
I know about twilio. The idea is to have 2 independent parties, the gateway and the web-service processing your transaction, to reduce the level of trust needed.
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:46:12
The app used for this prototype is envayasms, it can run in the background. But you want to keep the phone at one place and connected to the internet all the time for you customers. also your private sms would be send to the server, which is maybe not wanted :D 
The gateway is more like a small business you set up, better use a dedicated phone.
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:52:05
big transactions are double-checked by the web-service. you will get a call with the transaction details, asking for your pin to confirm.
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:58:02
sorry for that, I've removed a lot of the duplicate accounts now. drop me an email with your phone number, i'll have a look.
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:54:36
there are 2 things that need to connect, the message queue and the http client. both should be successful. 
drop me an email at johann[at]37coins.com for support.

right, actually the voice pin system askes your pin. you have to create it first time you are called.
the gateway just uses a one-time token to prevent number spoofing.
