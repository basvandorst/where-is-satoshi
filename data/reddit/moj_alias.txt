Well, I recently instructed a friend to open a segwit wallet in Electrum but was later unable to send her the coins. Bech32 addresses are not recognized by Coinbase or even Ledger.
There is a way of opening a Electrum wallet with your ledger that works, but it is too complicated.
So my friend ended up using legacy wallet.
One down due to extremely slow adaptation of segwit by main wallets and services!!

Fair enough. Thank you anyway!

Honestly I don't remember anymore so you're probably right. But I do remember that the fee seemed high at the time. It doesen't seem high for today's standards but then it seemed high. At least to me :|

Thank you! Can you recommend any?

Very simplified but - Yes!

I think one of the most frequently asked questions is when? So, when can we expect LN?

You can already see your s2x wallet on Ledger. Just go to advanced and select segwit2x wallet.

Experience. Mine is 17 y.o. and working like a charm.

Well, I'd like to see the statement which would explain the details on the replay protection too.
But the s2x wallet is already there. Just go to advanced &gt; segwit2x and that's it.

Why do you need a source? Your own Ledger is the source. Just plug it in and you'll see for yourself. It is there for weeks already.
I don't know about replay protection. Is it built in by deafult if the wallets are separate?

But it would be the end only if he decided to ruin the market.
As far as we know 1. most probably is already true but the end isn't happening.

Amazing app. Light, private, customizable. All that I've wished for and more. Ok, the widget would be nice though.
I really like the portfolio part. Thank you!

Why would 1. be the end?
