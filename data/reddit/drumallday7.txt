Lol I must have missed something because I sure as hell don't understand why you defending your submission has been downvoted so. Have +1 good sir.

Thanks much, I'm on crappy 3G right now but I'll assume that has the info...upvote for you!

For real though, what is it about this post that offends you? I'm confused as to why you're even looking at this sub if something like this pushes proverbial your buttons.

So they don't have to answer to the SEC at this point yet?  Or are they thinking people won't realize that an investment by nature involves risk, and that bitcoin is above that?  ANY investment firm that makes these types of guarantees should be avoided at all costs.  
Unreal.

I agree.  His FAQ's basically point to the money paying for $5k in student debt and then starting a business.  8 months ago, he was still in school and wanting to start a business.  Funny how you don't see anything about what he has a degree in or what kind of business he would start.  I would think that if I really wanted a job, anything like this site that gets looked at, would have my qualifications for sure.

I don't tell people about how it can be treated just like a stock or a short-term investment, I only tell them about the technology behind it, and how much of a possibility it has to replace the good ol' dollar.  
There are people in it merely for the short-term gains, and others hoping it works for functionality reasons.  There will always be an exchange rate, and people will manipulate it while they can for their short-term gains.  It's up to people that see its true potential to make sure it gets to where it needs to, and used for the greater of society.
One of the only reasons it's making national media is because it can be treated like a stock on the market, and hasn't completely lost value after gaining so much value to begin with.  The current value shows it is a sustainable 'product' at this point to be leveraged.  I don't see much media coverage about the visions the grassroots community has about it.

I bet we could get Iran to sell us one.
