If you sum the satoshis transferred from this more complete query, you wind up with 67,09,158,579,851 — or in more colloquial terms, approximately 67,091.59 BTC. This falls short of the full 119,756 BTC Bitfinex admits was stolen, which suggests almost half the hack (roughly 52,484 BTC) was from P2SH addresses below our self-imposed 10BTC threshold. ?????????????
