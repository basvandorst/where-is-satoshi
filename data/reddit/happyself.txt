Great advice, but how, exactly, does one just start using Linux?  I'd like to for security...
@_date: 2015-08-25 15:16:34
Of course not!  That was 100% a CYA reply with 0 genuine intention to actually help beyond what the superficial tier-1 tech support troubleshooting will get wrong.  In my opinion.
@_date: 2015-08-29 13:05:04
What are your circumstances?  Do you live outside of the US?  Are you not linking your bank account directly?  Mine is yes to both and no minimums.  GL!
Edit:  Correction.  I checked and have a $500 weekly limit.

What's your suggestion for a solid cold storage?

Trying to figure out how I can refer myself...
@_date: 2015-08-29 12:49:28
I do!  BUY!
@_date: 2015-08-25 20:31:31
Any chance payees could have an option to pay with a CC(in USD), and this app would handle the conversion to BTC?  Clients hire freelancers because they themselves are not tech savvy, so I wouldn't expect too many of them to be all set up with a BTC merchant/wallet.
@_date: 2015-08-20 01:03:00
Well how can you diversify if you only have enough $ for one purchase?
@_date: 2015-08-26 02:14:00
I saw it at 210.  Saw it again at $217.  Then kicked myself when it was in the 220's and I still hadn't pulled the trigger.  Prob never be that low again.

He has the most punchable face I have seen in months!  No wonder he fucked up and got arrested, and hopefully punched.
@_date: 2015-08-29 13:13:54
If you're still searching for a simple place to buy/sell Bitcoin, I recommend Circle.com.  It's been working great for me.  You'll need the typical payment method verifications but then you'll be set.
@_date: 2015-08-10 13:56:17
[BitPay](  It has a free plan.
@_date: 2015-08-29 13:09:44
If you sign up by connecting your Reddit account do you have to spend it on Reddit, or can Changetip Bitcoin purchases transfer to a mobile and/or HD wallet?

HA HA perfect!  Get outa here with your bahhumbug Mr. Mcscroogepants!  Up is always better than what's beneath that.  I'm happy to see price raising up.  I'm also curious what the catalyst was since Friday.
@_date: 2015-09-03 10:14:11
BOOM!  Thank you!  OP's post reeks of shill.


@_date: 2015-09-09 20:19:55
Good info!  I hadn't even considered that.
@_date: 2015-09-17 13:18:26
Not to mention redundant.  
@_date: 2015-09-15 17:59:38
I belong to the former group, FWIW.
@_date: 2015-09-08 23:14:56
A spike is not sideways and it's not down, so smile about this ol' chap.  Additionally, there's only one way for BTC to improve over its past digressions, which is to move in a spikey, upward trajectory.
@_date: 2015-09-08 14:00:21
You forgot the "you are here" X.
@_date: 2015-09-08 13:57:37
That's hilarious.  "I'm an investor".

I know 100% with every not sure fiber in my being, we will never see BTC below $225 again.  NEVER!

Kinda boring lately.  Stuck in purgatory.

@_date: 2015-11-03 02:16:23
Did anyone cash out at the top of the $1200 mountain?  That would be so satisfying!
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:13:12
Almost every post on here is agenda-based BS.  Hard to find informed updates in this sub, tbh.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:57:45
And increase value for holders.
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:12:49
If you woke up to a $120 discount per Bitcoin, wouldn't you buy too?  Multiply that across the Chinese BTC exosphere.  THAT'S WHY!
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:15:25
Sorry, it was live as I typed the post.  I thought they were doing a full segment but they just said "*wow BTC is up a lot, anyone know why?*"  Seriously, that's all he said :)  Not sure why they teased it before a commercial break just to ask that.
@_date: 2015-11-02 14:03:39
You might want to laminate them.  Kind of scary to think about holding so much value in little pieces of paper.
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:44:29
I see they bought web cams for the mentally disabled assisted living home.

A 1999 formatted website to discuss one of the most futuristic concepts in tech.  WTF?
Can we not do the AMA on Reddit, where AMAs are known?  The formatting on this website is a deterrent.
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:47:30
HA HA.  Thanks for the good belly laugh.
@_date: 2015-11-01 22:27:58
I didn't like it.  
He states "Bitcoin has no value, unlike gold" (*I'm so sick of this weak argument.  Anything that is valuable, tulips, gold, Bitcoin, is only valuable because the majority agree it is*) and asks how will he get his money if the internet is shut down, as if fiat money would still be available in that scenario.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:40:24
How does his charitable trust, 'The Street' assets and his two shows on CNBC all stay afloat, if he's as bad as you describe?
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:46:35
Fear?  You might be ascribing that on him out of personal hope.  To me he stated his opinion clearly, with confidence.
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:22:34
You never explained why to get BTCs out of exchanges.  Great write up!
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:38:34
So any BTC purchase after today is "too late"?  You heard him, everyone, let's close up shop.  Time to move on.
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:46:24
OUCH!  Sorry, bro.
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:25:05
No way.  It's crashing more.  Fucking annoying.  BTC can't ever gain traction.  You'll buy now and wait 5 years to realize some value, hopefully.  I'm starting to think BTC isn't worth it
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:38:49
This contributes NOTHING to the discussion, idiot.  This isn't even a post about the potential of a bubble, it's just a funny meme.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:48:17
If he didn't dead stare into the camera I'd be OK with his stone cold demeanour.  Dat stare tho
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:45:57
How are you determining this?
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:14:06
"You can get with this, or you can get with dat"
@_date: 2015-11-15 14:55:58
Surges, huh?  Do you even read your click bait titles before you copypasta them?  Or did you mean surge downward?
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:17:11
BUY THE DIP!
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:10:40
I sold a BTC before $300 (for a decent profit).  Now look at the price.  I should have held it longer.  Hard to know tho.  **Better to profit small than none at all**.  Good thing that wasn't my only BTC, and I incrementally purchase more each week.  
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:53:42
Every time you mention Bitcoin to a laymen they knee jerk say as quickly as possible, "BUBBLE"!
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:06:57
You're so much cooler than us!  Who gives a shit if someone is new?  Quit judging, you're not important enough to get to do that.
@_date: 2015-09-20 11:09:00
Most confusing chart yet!  Seriously, too difficult to put the %s next to the names also, or only use the same color once?
@_date: 2015-10-29 14:22:19
BTC price?
@_date: 2015-10-29 14:25:59
For us who don't click empty link posts, WHY is BTC "about to break out", OP?
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:58:13
What's your point?  You never made it.
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:03:37
He just butthurt for not buying BTC cheap.
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:44:51
OK, that was like 10 seconds.  At least CNBC mentioned BTC.  Still a good thing!
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:48:32
For what?  Answering a question with his opinion?  **How dare he**!  Yet you're wishing people cancer?  Comparing the two, yours is the most asshole-ish.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:11:49
Yes, yes I have!  I guarantee you he didn't sell at $500 tho.
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:34:08
Care to explain WHY?  Anyone can post a statement on Reddit.
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:31:35
How do I do this?  Can anyone register data to the blockchain
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:50:51
Any data/research to substantiate your... guess?
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:09:17
When you "add money" make sure to select BTC as the currency.  Boom, you're in.  I use Circle daily and love love love it.
Otherwise, how about Gemini?
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:30:26
I'd be OK with that.

Would you say we're in the "real deflation" stage now, or where?

Pretty much perfect analogy!  Buy the dip!
@_date: 2015-10-25 15:43:03
Did so earlier today on Circle!
@_date: 2015-10-28 12:54:51
Have you ever taken a writing class, or worked somewhere you were counted on to explain yourself?  Seems not.  BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST MAKING BOLD STATEMENTS AND NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE GROWTH OF ACTUAL CONVERSATIONS.
When you're about to click save and feel like a kid king for your wise claims, ask yourself, did I tell or show?  always show, motherfucker!  Always!
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:45:57
Kramer said the same thing in that old video posted in this sub today.  Is there any merit to the claim?
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:35:41
Please fucking explain WHY after you puke out a bold claim.
@_date: 2015-10-17 19:46:12
How dare you look ahead with optimism!  There is no upward trend until AFTER it's over, DUH!  Until then you're a pleb who wasn't here since 2013 and don't know wall street!  /s
@_date: 2015-10-16 00:55:36
@_date: 2015-09-08 23:19:37
Any ideas why?  Seems like more of a slow-paced, more permanent increase and not necessarily a short-lived reactional increase.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:55:36
With a transparent blockchain, how, exactly, could this be done?
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:25:41


Dayum!  I can only imagine how many/how much you have now.  That's what I'm hoping for over the next 5-10 years.
@_date: 2015-10-24 19:55:27
Or, you could keep everything out in the open and encourage a discussion online.  If only we all had a forum where that would be possible...
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:56:24
Interesting to see the infrastructure used outside of a currency transaction.
Is it possible the Blockchain can garner all the limelight and Bitcoin currency itself decline from lack of interest/use?
@_date: 2015-10-29 14:24:10


I second djleo's comment.  Skip this article.  It's click bait and OP didn't even TL;DR it for us like a good OP.
@_date: 2015-10-16 00:51:10
Sure, the beginning of it.
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:20:42
Isn't that the whole point?  Cashless.  No physical cash to "withdraw"?  LOL  You obviously use a computer so I would assume you know money can be moved in/out/around account w/out ever having to hold physical cash.

Give a man enough money and he will buy a prostitute.  This isn't news.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:10:19
[noob q]  Would this also matter to people buying/storing their BTC on their exchange, such as Circle, Gemini, etc?
@_date: 2015-10-28 13:28:52
Can we have the blockchain w/out Bitcoin?  I worry the chain tech will get ported and Bitcoin itself will get dropped.  Am I worrying unnecessarily?
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:04:52

@_date: 2015-10-19 14:19:54
Can the blockchain be recreated?  Yeah yeah, banks suck at teamwork and would make a shit product...  but I'd rather not leave it to the chance banks wont work well together.
