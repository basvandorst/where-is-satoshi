Most of the people around here still find it tough to buy some bitcoins with Paypal, Credit or Debit Card. This is largely as a result of repeated cases where a person pays for bitcoins with PayPal, receives bitcoins and then fraudulently complains to PayPal or perhaps their credit card company they never received the goods.
Having said that there is a workaround that can be done in order to use Paypal to buy Bitcoins but it comes with a premium fee. Check out the following link for instructions.

Official UPDATE: This again appears to be another strong DDos attack. We are working hard to overcome it and will update when possible. It's currently 2am in Japan so please forgive us if our Facebook/Twitter updates are not as quick, though the team is certainly not taking any breaks. We're very much looking forward to implementing a much stronger solution very soon and will make an announcement to that effect once it's in place.
