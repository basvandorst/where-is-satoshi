I was interested in something like you describe - I wasn't able to find anything really, so decided to make one. Here are a couple of poor shots of it in action.
The majority of the code isn't mine. I found something similar on GitHub and switched to pull in prices from GDAX.

buying here.. I'm just too impatient to see if it will go any lower.
I bought at 5.8k last year and recently started adding in the 6-7k range
I'm not a trading expert so I've just been holding. No clue where this goes in the next 12-24 months.. It's pretty interesting.

it sounds like a bad idea homie. 
buying 1 btc wont help the community any more than you just dca what you can afford.

when using coinbase, you end up paying more in fees (~4% i think vs .25% on gdax and gemini) in addition to coinbase slightly inflating the price on their buy page.
if doing $500 or less, i'd suggest using gemini since you can immediately trade. if youre planning on spending more, gdax or gemini let you wire funds directly. hope this helps.

i really like using Gemini - it let's you immediately trade once you initiate a deposit. if you decide to use coinbase, i'd suggest transferring to gdax once your deposit clears.
