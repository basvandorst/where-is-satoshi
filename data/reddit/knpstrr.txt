No it isn't. You can do the fiat to BTC conversion yourself.
Bitwage most certainly does NOT provide an "essential" service.
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:54:29
I don't think he cared.
One thing is for certain. you put in 3 orders for 6,000 each in 24 hours you are GUARANTEEING to get a lower price.
You put in a 6,000 BTC order and the market is at $20,000 it won't get filled at $20,000.
Again, I think this was of zero concern to him. He was simply satisfying legal obligations, not maximizing value.

You are not understanding what I am saying.
If someone puts in 3 sell orders of 75% of the day's trading volume in KO today KO stock will drop SHARPLY.
Putting in orders that big move the market. Fundamentals have no point in this discussion.

That isn't true at all. Market price is supply and demand on exchanges. The more people HODL the less the supply. If whales buy up and HODL everything the price will go up! Everyone buys/holds, VERY few sellers = price increase.
Now, for those that want/dream BTC to be a "currency" this is terrible for that function. A currency you want to circulate constantly (not necessarily on exchanges, but privately). You don't want people to buy BTC then never "use it".

You really didn't know that? Credit card companies charge merchants 2.5-3.5% when people use credit cards.
The company mentioned must do roughly $100K a month.
This is essentially "unproductive" revenue for C.C. companies that is leeched from businesses now that bitcoin exists.

Bitcoin debit cards kind of defeat the purpose of bitcoin don't they?
Isn't the point to cut out the middlemen, not continue to use Visa/Mastercard/Banks/etc?
I thought your "debit card" should be your bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:05:15
Nothing other than time involved. ACH transfers take 3-8 days. So if an employer paid you in BTC you'd have it in that form sooner.
Since you have to convert to fiat to pay bills (whether thru 3rd party like shift or not) it may make sense to received USD, pay your bills, put whats remaining into BTC.

I am a landlord and have been considering seeing if my tenants want to pay in BTC, the are all low income so I don't know if they'd be interested or not. Do you just pay directly to your landlord's wallet? Or does he use some payment provider?
Thanks for all of your information. I don't mean to be adversarial so I hope you did not interpret my comments in that way. I am relatively "new" into looking at BTC seriously. I used to think it was some sort of scheme, I have learned otherwise.
I hold only a very small amount of BTC currently (less than .01) just to "get a feel" for how it works.

Again, fundamentals have NOTHING to do with this discussion. I am aware KO is a business and bitcoin is not. You do not need to keep mentioning it.
I'm talking about trading volume, how it relates to order size and how that can affect prices.
@_date: 2018-03-05 12:18:49
Yes, I think it would be too complicated to explain if someone wasn't already interested in it.
Just a comment:
Exchanging fiat to BTC can be free, it just takes time. ACH transfers to exchange is free (but takes a week) and "maker orders" are free on exchange. Even e-mailed wallet transactions can be made free inside of coinbase using two coinbase wallets.
The "problem" is that coinbase invokes a third party. Which is a flaw by principle.
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:06:30
I'm not comparing bitcoin to Coca-cola on the basis of valuation. I was giving an example of when you put in orders for 75% of a days normal trading volume you are going to move the market by yourself.
I was comparing what some of the world's best investors considered a self-imposed limit on trading volume. They considered putting in orders of 1/3 a days volume the limit they could do without moving the market too much and on a MUCH more liquid market no less.
I'm going to go out on a limb and say 3/4 the volume is too much in ultra thin market.
I never even hinted anything towards mentioning valuation. I have no idea why you brought that up.
Also to clear things up, attempting to predict "buying/selling" is NOT fundamental analysis. It is the realm of technical analysis. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 12:22:37
Not exactly. You are exchanging your bitcoin for USD at current exchange rate and then spending USD. It is all just done automatically "behind the scenes".

First link is bitwage.com which lets you "receive your salary" in BTC for a 1% fee + $16/mo subscription fee. Which means they are exchanging for you no?
Coinsfer - "Pay bills in US" for 15%, 10% or 5% fee depending on the size of the bill. Which means they are exchanging for you no?
It is an admirable goal to "live only on btc" perhaps it can be done in some very select places already. But really what that means for most is fiat-&gt;BTC-&gt;fiat for most people and using 3rd parties to exchange for you.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:56:43
He sold 34,800 BTC i read. (still a small amount). But rember not every bitcoin is "liquid". Many are HODLing so not available for buy/sell on exchange.  For example, on blockchain.info it says on 3/6/18 only 135,497 were transacted. Of course that is on the ENTIRE blockchain. Many of those could be off of the exchanges, between wallets. 
On GDAX, for example, the last 24 hours only 23,382 BTC has been traded. One 6,000 sale is 25% of the volume for a day! The BTC market is EXTREMELY thin. So large orders can swing the market up or down.

He [Draper] won a government auction in 2014. He purchased 30,000 BTC for an undisclosed amount.
He may be right, but not exactly unbiased.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:42:33
Correct, all involving 3rd parties. And fees (in some case 15% charge?!?!). So someone is selling to USD or BTC for you, you are just paying them for the hassle... or you can do it yourself.
Which is what I said.

Fundamentally a bank account is used to keep your money "safe" and protect your money (somewhat) from inflation.
Bitcoin in a safe/secure wallet does both of those things. It is safe (with proper wallet/storage) and protects against inflation via being a fixed supply. So banks are obsolete with bitcoin for most people.
The one function not currently replaced is lending and/or payroll functions that some banks provide. These won't be hard to develop for the mainstream if bitcoin is adopted globally. So the banks days are indeed numbered.

You can't have a "freely available" coin that is sure to keep whales away. Whales are part of the market, every market - whether they buy their way in or organically develop. We all have to learn to live with them.
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:51:08
Do you have a contract stating your wage is say 0.05 BTC per week? Or is your contract still in fiat and the employer does the relevant exchange calculation to BTC? So do you accept say 0.05 BTC no matter what the current price is or does your BTC fluctuate each pay period? If it fluctuates and you don't agree to accept a static amount of BTC then really the employer is just exchanging for you.
Your links you provided merely validate my point that for most of us. It is nothing more than paying third parties to convert fiat to BTC when you are paid and BTC to fiat for you when you pay your bills. 
Not saying this will never change, it is just the way it is right now. People like you are certainly pushing to change. Particularly if your employer and the people you pay your bills to realize you want to use BTC. If it is "behind the scenes" exchange (As an example prepaid BTC debit cards) it doesn't put pressure on businesses to consider accepting BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:23:22
Your first comment suggested you use bitwage which is a 3rd party fee service to convert your wage to BTC. So you aren't really getting paid in BTC. You are paying someone to convert your paycheck to BTC for you.
@_date: 2018-03-05 12:55:55
I agree, that is why I included my last line. Merely stating how it CAN be done for free for renters.

He sold in chunks of 6,000 BTC according to zero hedge. He sold 18,000 BTC in a day according to a zero hedge article.
For example, the last 24hrs GDAX sold 23,300 BTC. Smart traders don't put in orders for 75% of a normal days trading volume. (I realize GDAX isn't the only exchange, just for illustration).
THe BTC market is EXTREMELY thin. So large orders move it. Obviously the lawyer/trustee for the mt gox case doesn't care. He is just selling to satisfy the legal obligations. But it demonstrates how tiny BTC is.
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:35:09
btc fees can be somewhat high at the moment. A miner doesn't charge fees on $ amount or btc amount, but transaction size. So if you are piecing together lots of previous transactions the size may be larger.
So you could have spent $5,000 and miner fee would have been $0.13 too. Or $5,000,000 and the miner fee $0.13 too.
But the LN should reduce fees to near zero as that comes online, making the ability to spend smaller amounts relatively less expensive.
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:27:39
yes, either way, it is not "being paid in BTC". A third party converts your fiat pay to BTC for you for a fee. Something one could do themselves.
@_date: 2018-03-05 12:54:04
Correct and I agree "they are" as in your card issuer.
Or for those that use BitPay you actually "load your card" with USD per their website, ones balance isn't in BTC.
Shift Card works with Coinbase who does any need exchanges for you.

The appropriate method would be to auction the BTC - off the exchanges. Then it wouldn't affect the market price.
When the U.S. gov't seizes coins, they don't sell them on exchanges, they auction them off.

it would drop the market and lower the price the whale gets for their BTC and the buyer gets a deal.
Smart sellers don't flood the market. Same with smart buyers. They buy and sell in small chunks to not work against themselves.
If you flood with buy orders you raise the price on yourself, if you flood with sell orders you lower the price on yourself. Sophisticated traders don't do this.

Maybe, maybe not. You don't know.
But if you sold 1,000 BTC per day, the exchanges are open 24 hours a day. So selling 41.666666667 blocks every hour may have been the way to go. Rather than putting in 3 different 6,000 BTC orders in 24 hours.
Charlie Munger has stated (Warren Buffett's partner) that when they bought Coca-Cola they bought "as much as they could buy" "roughly 1/3 of the volume trading" for months. More than that they would affect the price too much. and of course even at 1/3 the volume you wouldn't put it in 1 order.
Again, the gox trustee wasn't out to maximize value. It is as simple as that.
