yes, i agree 100%
i see 2019 (and most likely past that) as being a real doldrum
with prices alternating between stability and slight declines.
much like the frog in the boiling pot of water story, i think prices will ever so SLOWLY slightly drop, bit by bit, and with a few upward spikes along the way to distract us, until... over the course of the next year, and before we know it, we'll be like "bitcoin is $3000, what? when/how did that happen?"
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:21:28
oh look, its a rude person!
@_date: 2018-10-31 19:31:54


good luck!
unless you were an early adopter, bitcoin is to getting rich just like benjamin buttons is to aging
@_date: 2018-10-31 22:22:47


if you don't know already
then nothing i can say, no matter how logical, will clarify
you either "get it" or you don't.
good day to you!
lets stop with the side topic comments, and stick to the subject of this thread and this subreddit (which is bitcoin)
if you have something to say about bitcoin, then i'm all ears
otherwise, consider me not interested.
@_date: 2018-10-31 22:20:28
oh, in that case
its between them, i'm cool with that!
nothing to do with me...

@_date: 2018-10-31 20:56:36
why would you say a lie like that?
yes, i did buy bitcoin, and yes i did lose value since then
but whats with the personal insults (and lies)?
seriously what is wrong with you?
@_date: 2018-10-31 22:28:36
yes, i agree
and thank you!
wise words (quite refreshing!)
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:08:28
another lie
seriously, what is wrong with people like you?
weird behavior
I am happy to admit that I bought Bitcoin in late 2017 and since then its lost about 55% of its total value
but I am (personally) alright, i only invested what i could afford to lose.
its sucks to lose over half of what i originally invested, but i am not someone who bought so-called shitcoins.
its odd that you (who do not know me nor my investing portfolio) would just come on here to lie.
thanks for the laugh (at your expense)
your type cracks me up! 
@_date: 2018-10-31 22:30:58
yes 
someone personally called me a "burnt shitcoiner" (which was both an insult and a lie)
as such, that I simply pointed out that someone else personally insulted me, and lied about me, is not me "personally insulting" them.
its just me pointing out that i was personally insulted.
seriously, do you not even understand something as basic as that?
@_date: 2018-10-31 19:36:16
I remember in the early months of 2018 when everyone was saying "Oh bitcoin price just dropped because it was Chinese new Year, and once thats over bitcoin price will come back up"
well... its October 2018, and the price of bitcoin is still down.
C'mon Chinese people, you've been celebrating your New Years for 10 months now, time to end your new years celebrating, so bitcoin's price can go back up.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:28:42
All year long, I've been saying that bitcoin would crash for the entire 2018
Because of this, i've been called names, been told i am an idiot who just is spreading FUD
...and worse.
and yet, its me (the idiot) who's been right all along, and all the "bitcoin will come back any day now" people, who have been wrong.
Will any of them apologize to me?
naw, I doubt that, they'll just skulk away, and live in denial.
but for anyone who cares, bitcoin has crashed ALL of 2018
and it will crash all of 2019.
It will go down to between $1K-$4K by the end of 2019
and after 2019?
it will either die, or slowly inch back up.  But it will only be losing money for the net 14 months (at least) 
Listen to me, or not, but anyone who says this latest dip is temporary, is 100% wrong.  Things are looking bad for bitcoin, and only getting worse.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:40:12


that what those who were part of napster, or AOL, or myspace, or a million other failed tech innovations said too.
that's not to say that bitcoin will definitely fail, but i do feel it will personally (i guess, we'll just have to wait and see)
but acting like the success of bitcoin is a *done deal* or that its guaranteed, is foolish.
its on shaky ground, its failing right now, and whether it can recover is something that only time will tell.
@_date: 2018-11-28 08:17:30


at least we can agree on one thing
i think by 2022 it will be dead (or so close to dead that it won't matter)
by the end of 2018 it will be down to $2k is my guess
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:32:44
you saw it here first folks
time number  was correct
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:23:03
the fact that bitcoin has come back in the past does not guarantee that it will this time.
i mean, do you even know how reason and logic works?
that you use this to refute bitcoins dire straights shows the overall illogic of your way of thinking.
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:41:01


i never said it would, i said it might
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:31:26
call it what you will
but just wait
btc will be down to 1-2K by the end of the year
I don't like it, but that's just the way its gonna be
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:01:02
hey, i HOPE youre right
bitcoin is essentially a garbage investment at this point, and still crashing downward even harder
I still am HODLing, so i got fucked pretty hard in buying bitcoin.
so yeah.... ill be laughing too (with joy) IF bitcoin ever came back up.
I'm just saying i doubt it ever will.
I think its on the toilet, and being flushed to even lower values in the year ahead
@_date: 2018-11-01 01:25:29

this is amazing, watching you be so amazingly oblivious is just too funny!
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:43:01
i hope you get rid of them before the value goes even lower
each day you hold is money lost
@_date: 2018-11-23 17:56:52


because some of us did first invest in bitcoin in late 2017
and basically, anyone who got into bitcoin from late 2017 onward has lost a shitton of money
its a dying asset, worse each month in 2018 (and still crashing hard)
early adopters did fine, but anyone who bought from late 2017 onward has lost money
and anyone who was an early adopter and who didn't sell a bunch when bitcoin was at its ATH is a total idiot and loser.
I mean, at this point, its basically a shit investment, so might as well hold onto garbage investment bitcoin (and see where it goes?)
but my opinion? its basically over and just heading to even lower lows (much lower)
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:47:58
thats not what your mama said last night as i was banging her.

@_date: 2018-11-17 01:44:31
all year (some) people on here have been attacking and insulting me because i said BTC was heading towards $4-5K by the end of the year
Looks like I am right on target.  And all those who said it would never go below $17K or 14K, or 12K, or how it could NEVER go below $8k, or 7K or 6K were wrong.
Will any of them apologize to me, and admit they were wrong?
what do you think?
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:13:14
good point!
i mean, its cool to make money, but to brag about it to others who lost most of their investment (like u/RallyUp does) is a real dick move.
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:16:08
crash trolls?
anyone in the last year who said bitcoin was going to crash, is not a troll
but is 100% correct
during the last year, anyone who said that bitcoin was going to the moon (which was most on here) were the idiots who were wrong
i was someone who had said most of this year that bitcoin would crash (and i was correct)
i am also now saying that bitcoin will crash even more in the months ahead.
you can heed my warning or not, I am just saying that i am 100% correct, and all the moon people have been wrong for an entire year (but you believe who you want to)
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:35:22
always a demand for high risk investments,
some do well, most fail
my best guess? that bitcoin will be one of the ones that fails
@_date: 2018-11-12 18:22:10


yeah, he definitely loves to fuck a lot of people
he fucked me real hard back in january 2018, and then after fucking me, he ran off with 60% of my money
i am still HODLing out hope that he'll come back, but (to tell the truth) I think that he's never coming back, and that the money he stole is gone for good.
oh well...
its my own fault, after all people did warn me about him.
I mean, yes... he was nice to people back before 2018, but since then he's been a real jerk.  Good riddance to him.  buh-bye!
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:42:41
this is a great opportunity to buy
i love this!
i'm just in it for the tech.
after going this low, it can ONLY go to the moon now.
oh... and let me introduce myself, i'm Mr. Denial
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:57:41


in other words, its gonna keep crashing
and will be down to $1-2K by the end of 2018
@_date: 2018-11-18 19:34:43
yes, this is such an obviously point, that the only conclusion is that many of the bitcoin fan bois must have cognitive dissonance that blinds them to this truth.
in other words, yes... its quite possible that bitcoin will go up in value, perhaps even reaching past ATHs and beyond.
but its also very possible that bitcoin will continue to lose value, and will never again reach its past ATH (or that a superior technology will come along and make it obsolete, or even that a technology such as quantum computing or some other tech advancement in cryptology will come along that will make it no longer a secure store of value)
Point being, there are MANY unknown variables, and thinking that bitcoin going 'to the moon" is a sure thing is a foolish outlook.
@_date: 2018-11-01 02:06:40
your dad wears purple pants?
uh oh!
@_date: 2018-11-18 18:13:52
when an asset goes from $20k to $6K in less than one year then most of the criticism isn't because of "paid shills"
its from actual owners of btc (people like me) who are VERY unhappy with its price.
I put my own hard earned money into buying bitcoin (for which I accept full responsibility) and then I lost 60% of that money in just a few months.
My own fault, no one made me buy that bitcoin (and yes... I am still hodling) still, losing most of the money that i put into an asset does make me think and say negative things about bitcoin.
So enough with the paranoid conspiracy theories that all the negative talk is from paid shill and bots.  It's not.  Most of the negative talk is from actual bitcoin owners who lost a lot of their money in buying bitcoin.
Of course, that ALL year, fan bois of bitcoin have been saying "bitcoin is going to the moon" (when in reality is has been going to the toilet all of 2018) doesnt help either.
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:57:12
I agree it was insane to buy back then (it was a gamble at the very least) but at least IF it went up, there was a huge upside
of course, to buy it now is even more foolish.  the risk is HUGE, and the upside is much smaller.
Huge risk, with little upside... thats the very definition of a bad investment.
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:16:26
you are sympathetic to yourself?
thats cool
now just be a quiet canadian, and keep your thoughts to yourself
@_date: 2018-11-13 00:26:42
although, guys like me who started buying bitcoin a year have lost 50% of the money that we put into bitcoin
sure, i plan on hodling, 
but i sure wish i was like those people who bought pork bellies, tobacco, timber land or weed.
@_date: 2018-11-23 17:51:59


youre so dumb, and wrong!
i only invested what i could afford to lose
nonetheless, thats still probably more money than you make all year.
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:36:51


i say the same thing
with many weirdos saying i should put my personal info out there? I'm not anonymous to be "brave" I am anonymous to be safe against weird internet strangers
implying that its cowardly to remain anonymous? that is creepyAF
Too many old creepers on here, gotta be safe?
Whatever the case, i'm not giving out my personal info on the internet
sorry, no way, no how.
and when strange men i don't even know are calling for me and others to not be cowards, and to reveal my personal info, that just makes me want to stay anonymous that much harder.
sorry, no name, no address, no pics, nothing like that, no matter how much certain people on here try to insist!
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:36:44
these rich fucks don't care, its like buying a lottery ticket to them.  besides, they get and stay rich either way.
on the other hand, your regular working class guy or gal? we feel it, when bitcoin crashes 90% in less than a year.
so hey... glad to see these rich fucks laughing it up at their private beach resort between trips on their yachts, but i don't really care if they are saying they're bullish or not.
the reality is, regardless of what rich arrogant pricks say, is that bitcoin is a shitty investment (for anyone who bought after september 2017) and its only getting worse.
pretty soon, it will be under $1k, and the rich fucks will have moved on to their next scheme

when i created this username, about 4 years ago, i was in debt
things were rough
but about 2 years ago, everything turned around for me, and the last two years have been financially amazing
yes, i did lose some money in bitcoin, but it was a minor loss (and no big deal as i had only invested what i could afford to lose)
i am still HODLing, but either way (bull or bear) its just a small part of my portfolio 
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:18:22


doesn't matter how many bitcoin you have, what matters is their value
their value is 25% of what it was a few months ago
seriously, you don't understand that value is more important than quantity?
@_date: 2018-11-18 19:14:25
look, IF it goes back to $20K or higher I'll be happy (obviously)
but you are assuming it will, like its some kinda guarantee
personally, I think its just going to go down (for at least one more year, minimum)
Thats just my opinion, but I admit that I don't know for sure.
So enough with the ridiculous question.
Of course if it goes to $1M per bitcoin, I'll be happy
and of course, if it goes to $0 per bitcoin I'll be even more disappointed than I am now
I have no idea where it will be in a few years, i HOPE it goes higher, but i am also wise enough to know that it could go down to being worth pennies as another possibility as well.
I'm just gonna HODL on for now, but pretending that its a sure thing is not something I'd ever be so foolish to do.
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:09:17


you got that right, at this point, only a sucker would buy bitcoin
bitcoin is now the biggest shitcoin ever
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:06:47
All this year, I said bitcoin was going down to $4-5K by the end of 2018
and I was attacked, and told i was an idiot, that it would never go below $7K
well.... it turns out I was right after all.
I was wrong about one thing though, i ALSO have always been saying that bitcoin would go down to $1-2K by the end of 2019.  I didnt think that is true.
I think that we are watching the final death throws of bitcoin right now.
It will become junk, and be worth next to nothing within one year.
Yes, it will exist, but the bubble is popping as we watch, and it will go down to several hundred within the next few months.
You can doubt me, or not, but mark my words, bitcoin is over, and is dying (and is only propped up by a few deluded HODLers).
A bunch of whales made their money, and they are squeezing their last pennies out before it becomes the crypto version of junk bonds.
Do I KNOW for a fact bitcoin is dying and will soon be dead?  I guess not, no one can ever now for sure, but I am almost 99.000% positive, even more positive than i was about the price going down to $5k.
The ride was nice, boys... but its just one (not so) long ride to the end from here.
@_date: 2018-11-01 00:11:05
thats true
i did explain to you that IF you don't already understand, you never will.
your question kinda reminds me of the old riddle...
How do you keep an idiot in suspense?
@_date: 2018-11-18 19:17:07


um, there is no guarantee that i'll recover my losses
people acting like its guaranteed to go back up are foolish
it might go back up to ATH levels
its may never go up that high again
it might go much lower and stay there
I HOPE it goes up, but i'm not so foolish as to think that a return to ATH levels is a guarantee

those two crashes are only the same in regard to percentages

@_date: 2018-11-28 04:54:25
yes, i remember all the cheerleaders for bitcoin talk about how it was going to go to the moon (for sure) back in 2017
everyone of them has been proven wrong
bitcoin has been a huge money loser for over a year, and its STILL crashing down hard
and yet... people are still saying, any day now, it will go back up
hey.. it might?
but someone needs to also say that it might not.
my personal guess?  its just another dying shitcoin, soon to be brushed aside into the dustheap of technological history.
it was important for a moment, but much like napster, its no longer relevant

@_date: 2018-11-23 22:29:31


i invest, but mostly in real estate, and to a slightly lesser degree in a range of Vanguard funds.
I always knew bitcoin was a long shot, but I was willing to roll the dice, just in case.
As it turns out, myself (and anyone else who go in from late 2017 till today) bought too late.  So sure.. i am not happy that bitcoin is crashing, and will probably be dead (or near dead) within the next couple of years.  I know i was taking a risk, and I knew it was a long shot.  Now that it turns out that my one risky investment (bitcoin) has turned out to be a total dud, I am cool with it.
The rest of my wealth management is low risk, with decent returns, so thats jut how life goes.  You win some you lose some, just invest wisely, and hope for the best, and you'll be fine.
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:39:14
well, a so-called "shitcoin" that doesn't lose 90% of its value in less than a year is one thats better than bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-24 02:05:39

don't try to tell me lies and call it the truth
i've been on here about 1.5 years
and 90% of the comments and posts are about how bitcoin is going to go up, up, up
not only that, anyone who says that they think bitcoin will not do well is personally insulted, and often called a paid troll or a bot
so yes... most opinions on here are that bitcoin is a sure thing, and opinions that differ from that are barely tolerated, or outright banned 
its (very often) one big circle jerk, about how bitcoin is going to go up in value 
and hey... in the past, thats been the case
but looking at ALL of 2018, bitcoin just been one bit money loser 
will it go back up? i don't know, i hope so, but i am skeptical 
just saying that i don't think its likely to go up for at least a year (perhaps never) gets me down voted and attacked
so don't try to tell me otherwise, and don't say that most don't think its a sure thing, because i know better
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:17:45


yeah, because when it comes to technology, no one ever invents something newer and better

laugh all you like
i deserve it
i was super stupid to have bought then
oh well...
at least i was wise enough to only invest what i could afford to lose
i am still holding, so who knows? maybe I'll get lucky and IF it ever goes over $14-15K I'll break even or even wind up making money
@_date: 2018-11-18 18:18:17
in my opinion
bitcoin will be down t $4k by the end of 2018
then... bitcoin will continue this downward trend all of 2019, to finish 2019 at the $1-2K pricepoint
After that, it might go back up (its too early to tell, yet)
but if you want to try to make money on bitcoin, be prepared to hold ALL of 2019, and most likely all of 2020 (and thats just to break even)
Sell before 2020 and you'll lose money, guaranteed.  Its gonna continue going down for quite some time

@_date: 2018-11-18 18:36:16


that it lost over 60% of its value since i bought it, is why I'm upset
I never said that i blamed anyone else, or bitcoin itself (it was my choice to buy it)
I am just unhappy (as are millions of others) that buying bitcoin anytime in the last year is one of the worst investments of all time.
besides... i was saying to the early commenter, that most of the people who were being critical of bitcoin weren't paid shills or bots (which was what he was claiming) I was simply pointing out that most of the critiques of bitcoin were just regular people like me, who lost thousands of dollars after buying bitcoin.  We're not blaming anyone, we are simply saying we don't like bitcoin (and no, we're just unhappy with our purchase, that doesnt make up paid shills or a bot)
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:09:32
wait, so let me get this right...
is this guy saying that the "smart money" people buy when the price is low, and then sell when the price is high?
what a financial genius!  
@_date: 2018-11-28 06:24:37
the real indicator is bitcoin's price
its been crashing for nearly a year straight
and its STILL crashing
price is the most accurate indicator, and its looking really bad for bitcoin (thats the fact, Jack!)
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:53:16
I have no objective motivations.
I was actually quite clear this year that what I shared was just my opinion.
Nonetheless, for simply sharing my opinion that BTC would be down to $4-5K by the end of the year, I was attacked every.singe.time.
Oh well... I (personally) *wish* BTC would go up, but in my opinion it will continue to go down the rest of 2018 and ALL of 2019, too!
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:51:37
i don't know about all the other coins, but i bet there are coins that haven't lost 90% of their value this year
but either way, that still doenst mean that bitcoin is a good investment (its not)
congrats to all who got out while it was over $10K

McAfee predicted when bitcoin would reach a million (looks like he is going t be wrong).

and being pessimistic about an investment that's lost 60% of its value in one year, and is STILL going down isn't " the attitude of a hurt person", its a logical conclusion.

yes they did, they constantly said "oh bitcoin will NEVER go below XXX price" (fill in the blank, 12k, 10k, 7k, 6k, etc).
I've been accused of being a "paid troll" and a 
bot, and even was accused of "working for the whales" because I had the clarity to see beyond the hype, and could see bitcoin would go down below $5k.
I mean, I was fooled myself, i bought thinking it would go up, but as i studied and learned more, the truth became clear.  Sadly, bitcoin is most certainly dying, and the prices will be in the low hundreds within months.  i wish this were not true, but it is.
Let me repeat, in case you missed it... **"the prices will be in the low hundreds within months."**
Heed my warning, or not.. its your choice, but mark my words, that is what will happen.
@_date: 2018-11-19 00:20:58


yes, that's true
i do *hope* that bitcoin does better
no one, and i mean no one, can predict how it will do for sure (right now, it could go either way).
that an total idiot like you thinks they know whether bitcoin will go up or down just underscores how incredibly stupid and uninformed you are.
no one knows!
no one.
some might have more info, or be able to make more educated GUESSES
but in the end, they are still guesses.
Those of us who HODL will HOPE that bitcoin does better, but we can't say with any certainty whether it will, or whether it won't.
Seriously, you think bitcoin is a sure thing?
thanks for proving yourself to be the dumbest investor I have ever crossed paths with.

i do HOPE youre right
personally, i felt that bitcoin would crash to $5k or less this year
and i was right
i also feel like it will be down into the hundreds within a few months
and i feel that even stronger.
I guess we'll just have to wait and see if i am right once again.
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:58:05
the market has spoken, no one wants to use crypto
no matter how much people who bought bitcoin want others to use it, they are clearly not interested
and as an investment?  it seems that no one wants to buy an asset that's crashed so hard that it lost 80% of its value in less than a year, and its STILL crashing. (what a shocker that no one wants to invest in it, huh?)
bitcoin has become a joke, and anyone who admits to owning it in a few years will be laughed at and ridiculed.
it was a noble attempt, and a silly bubble, but ultimately bitcoin went no where, and did nothing.  another failure cast aside in the march towards progress.
bitcoin is over, deader than a microsoft Zune, its time to find a new dream to follow

the market has spoken, the public does not want to use bitcoin, 
and (surprise, surprise) investors don't want to buy an asset that has lot 80% of its value in less than a year, and is STILL crashing down hard.

um, no shit, sherlock
I'll never invest one more penny in dying bitcoin again.
as a long shot gamble, i will hold onto what i already own (as I only invested in bitcoin money i could afford to lose)
but buy MORE bitcoin?  LOL
nope, never again, it sucks!
as for it coming back, i hope it does (but i doubt it will).
and remember, just because it came back in the past, thats no guarantee it will again.
You said you invested before the bubble of 2017/2018
if so, i hope you sold at, or near, the $20k price of late 2017.
if you did, youre a genius, and congrats to you!!!
if you did not, youre a terrible investor, and my condolences on blowing it, bigly.

as someone who is obsessed with me, you should follow my advice a little better
i have been suggesting all along that people on here (you included) stop rambling on about personal opinions that have nothing to do with bitcoin
i also said we should try to limit talking to bitcoin related things.
you seem unable to do that on your own
here, let me help guide you.
bitcoin is pretty stagnant lately, and in my opinion... i don't think it will do very well the rest of 2018
thats my bitcoin opinion
(see, thats not too hard.  learn from the master, and do as i do... and who knows, you might be able to stay on point after all)
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:21:04

@_date: 2018-11-23 20:22:38


always? you do understand that, just because an investment recovered in the past does not mean that it will not eventually crash for good.
i mean, AOL, MySpace, and Wang Computers (and other technological break-through companies) had ups and downs before crashing for good, never to reach their ATHs again
as for...


it might come back in 2020 ?
my best guess is that it will be down below $1k in 2020

thats like the captain of the titanic trying to save the ship by telling the people already on the sinking ship to buy more tickets.
just accept it, bitcoin is fucked for a while.  it will keep sinking for the rest of 2018 and ALL of 2019.
but the end of 2019 bitcoin will be worth $4k (at the most), and might be as low as $1K
after that, it will either die, or slowly inch back up a bit.
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:35:27
no i am not.

@_date: 2018-11-23 23:33:30


actually, it *already* has died, just most on here don't know it yet.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:39:36


that's what i've been hearing all year, and yet... the price keeps going down, down, down (not up as predicted)
down 75% or more from end of last year
and its STILL sinking hard.
i hope it will come back, i think it might not!
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:29:31


i was predicting in early 2018 that bitcoin was gonna keep crashing and go down below $4k by the end of 2018.
Just about everyone said the dip was only temporary, and that i was crazy, and that bitcoin was still going to go to the moon.
we don't hear much talk of lambos or going to the moon anymore, do we?
I am not saying I know everything, but i was certainly right when MOST on here have been wrong.
no one wants bitcoin anymore.  its universally considered a sucker's bet by anyone who has a brain.  the HODLers want the public to adopt it, but the public is quite clear, they don't want it or like it.
and investors hate an unstable asset thats lost 80% of its value in a several months (and is STILL crashing down hard!)
i can admit it, i was fooled, in late 2017/early 2018, i bought bitcoin.  I studied bitcoin, and all the "experts" were saying it would go up to $40k or higher.
How'd that work out? (spoiler alert: bitcoin crashed and has crashed non-stop for an entire year, with no end in sight).
Anyway, after the crash of dec 2017, i quickly saw that bitcoin was garbage, and that it would fail.  I did not realize (at that time) that bitcoin would turn out to be the biggest shitcoin of them all.
but now i am pretty aware, bitcoin is circling the drain, and (odds are) its only gonna get worse from here on out.
as for my user name, i created it about 4 years ago, when i was actually in debt.  About 2 years ago things turned around for me, new attitude, new outlook on life, new optimism about where i lived, which spurred me onto a new job, great pay, and I got my investments in order (vanguard account and real estate) and they all started to really pay off, and the only bad investment i made was to buy bitcoin (luckily i only invested as a long shot, and only invested what i could easily afford to lose).
So, i'm fine.  But i was lured into buying bitcoin (way back in 2017) by the siren song of the "bitcoin is going to the moon" people.  So, these days... I'm just pointing out how i was right, when MOST were wrong, so that there is not just one opinion on here.  The other opinion (that bitcoin is a shitcoin) should be shared on here to warn others.

this is a place to honestly discuss bitcoin, its not the bitcoin fanboy site.
that you think only good news (as opposed to brutal honesty) is what this subreddit is about, is part of the problem.
We need to not be some pollyannish glee club, only looking at the positive no matter what.
we need to be honest when bitcoin does well, and we need to be honest that things are not going well, when they are not.
right now, bitcoin is crashing, and crashing hard.  Within a few months, it will be even worse, MUCH worse.
believe me or not, but you are foolish to think that limiting r/bitcoin to ONLY those who want to say positive things, no matter what, is a good idea.
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:07:11

i actually did not see your earlier comment
so, no... i have nothing against you, or any of your comments.
i am simply saying, i think that bitcoin is on the way down for good (and will be at the $1-2K point by the end of this year).
i WISH it would go up, but my opinion is that it's time has passed, and that bitcoin has now become the worlds biggest money-losing shitcoin of them all.

in actual terms, and in terms of monetary value, bitcoin is crashing hard, and worth less and less
but as long as you judge bitcoin by the standard of "do i like bitcoin?"
then sure, in that sense, bitcoin might have a certain sentimental value to someone.
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:19:49
yes, not much talk of buying a lambo anymore
the word is out, buying bitcoin is a dead end and a sucker's play.
people would rather buy stock in enron over bitcoin these days.
it was a glorious get-rich-scheme for the early adopters, for the rest of us, it was just a bad investment, that just got worse with each month.
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:49:02
shhhhhh, dick
no one cares.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:45:24


then again, any asset that loses nearly 80% of its value in less than a year is crashing, and crashing hard
i can't think of many examples where that happened, and an asset recovered (i'm sure theres a rare example, but its the exception)
Granted, in the past bitcoin crashed and came back (that doesn't mean it will this time, obviously).
so sure, i HOPE bitcoin bounces back, and you are correct, you never know... it *might*
i'm just saying that the odds are that it won't, and my personal opinion is that it will be down to $2K by the end of the year, and then will just slowly start to die off after that.
I don't think it will ever go down to $0, but i do think it will be in the hundreds, and just stay there (although, a new better technology totally replacing it, or quantum computing breaking its encryption, and making it obsolete are possibilities that could make it go to $zero)
@_date: 2018-11-18 19:27:49
yes, bitcoin is a total suckers play at this point
luckily, i only invested what i could afford to lose, and my other (wiser) investments, such as real estates and stocks/bonds are doing great.
So, i'll just hodl, and see what happens
but yes... to speak honestly, i think that bitcoin will only go down from here, and the money i invested is gone for good.
I gave it a shot, and basically lost (with bitcoin) I'll stick around and see what happens, but buy bitcoin again?  LOL never!

that is true, and part of that cycle is that (sometimes) the leading technology companies whither and die off (such as wang computers, AOL, netscape navigator, internet explorer, napster and friendster/mspace, etc.).
Will bitcoin whither and die?  No one can say for sure, but it does seems to be following the pattern of those other technology leaders that are now resigned to the ash heap of history.

agree with this (and your other points seem well thought out as well)
as for me, I'll HODL onto what i have.  I haven't sold any that I bought.  But I cant see any scenario where I'd buy more.
I'm cool to just sit, wait, and see what happens.
If i lose it all, so be it, and if it does go way up, I'd be pleasantly surprised to actually make money (I'd be happy to break even in fact, as i am down about 60 percent of what I paid).

if he keeps this up, we're gonna need a shovel to dig to find him
poor guy, he just can't seem to stop falling

sure, if you think of bitcoin as some concept not grounded in reality, and as a non-quantifiable entity, that you give whatever value you *feel* to it, then yes... through that lens, it can have value to you.
in the real world, using math, logic and actual measures of value, its in very bad shape, and have lost 75% of its value in a few months, as it still crashes more each day.

good point
burn $9950 and keep $50

yes, he is long dead, although he has a few friends who carry him around like "Weekend At Bernies" and pretend he is still alive

i did not invest more than i could afford to lose
i am simply saying that bitcoin is a terrible investment that lost 80% of its value in the last year
and that its still crashing down hard
i'll never buy more, 
buying bitcoin was the stupidest purchase of my life
@_date: 2018-11-18 18:42:32


yes, for early adopters, it was a great investment
for anyone who bought in this last year, its one of the worst investments of all time.
and yes, i already said i accept full blame for buying one of the worst investments ever.
i accept full blame, but i also dislike bitcoin now, as its the investment choice that lost me thousands.
i mean, i get your point, that its my fault, but that doesnt mean that i cant hate bitcoin now.
yes, i will hold and hope for the best, but i still regret ever having bought it int he first place, and I do not like it (but at this point, i'm just gonna continue to hodl,  ride it out and see what happens)
@_date: 2018-11-24 01:57:04
you wishes for bitcoin are nice
sadly, bitcoin is dying, and nearly dead
hopefully some crypto asset will come along and do those things you speak of.
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:34:44
that's the opposite of what people were saying on here in late 2017
now i know to never take others advice on here about bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:53:49
naw, i only bought what i could afford to lose
and i'm still HODLing
but i learned (since last year) never believe the "to the moon" people when it comes to bitcoin
its been a shitty investment for about a year now, and its only getting worse each month.
the public has spoken, and no matter how much the fan boys want the public to use bitcoin, the public is simply not interested.
i am just trying to be a sane voice on here, to counter all those who say bitcoin will come back up again
i got news for you, bitcoin is never coming back.  never.  its either gonna stay where it is, or (most likely) go MUCH lower
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:20:34


agreed, it had a great decade.  amazing in fact.  But much like AOL, friendster, napster, or Wang computers (all of whom dominated the market at one time) I think the golden age of bitcoin has passed, and yes... it will continue to exist, but only as a sideline player, that will eventually fade into obscurity.
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:52:17
$15,000 end of year Bitcoin price?
what an idiot this guy is.
�� �� ��
more accurate prediction would be $1500 end of year Bitcoin price.
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:33:22
i am going to hold
although, i think bitcoin will go down to $2k by the end of 2018
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:05:23
i bought bitcoin in 2017
worst investment in my life
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:41:21
yes, these born-in-1998 "geniuses" are the ones who spurned the FOMO bitcoin frenzies
sadly, bitcoin has no real value, and no one in the public (consumers nor investors) want to use it, and as such its dying from lack of any widespread adoption (and no matter how the HODLers try to make others want to use it, the public has spoken).
so, bitcoin will continue its slow descent into the toilet, and the crippled-by-foolish-student-debt genX"geniuses" living in their parents basements, will just move onto their next fad.
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:45:58
full of bears?
after bitcoin spent the entire year losing value? and after bitcoin lost 80% of its value in several months? after the pubic has shown (no matter how much the holders wish otherwise) that they have no interest in using bitcoin?
wow! I wonder why people are so bearish?
its like people looked at bitcoin and saw the truth for once.
they have awoken from a hazy dream and *finally* realized that its not whales, or exchanges, or chinese new year (or a million other excuses) but that its simply that bitcoin's time has passed, and that its an asset that no one wants.
Will it go down to zero? not likely.  will it go down to under $1k by the end of 2019?  I would guess... absolutely. that's essentially guaranteed.
will it go to the moon?  LOL no, that will never happen, again.
But hey... if someone wants to dream on, by all means, its your money, buy more bitcoin if you wish.
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:40:22
i just expressed an opinion
some people just can't handle any opinion other than "bitcoin is going to the moon"
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:59:32
good point, and why wouldn't investors want to buy an asset that has lost 80% of its value this year, and is still crashing downward at a rapid rate?
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:27:33
and if it breaks the other way, we could see a bear run all the way down to $4k
@_date: 2018-11-18 19:24:06


because, i know its foolish to try to time the market
i made a bet that bitcoin will go up in value
right now its a losing bet (by far!)
but, i'm not going to try to time the market, i'll just hodl and wait and see
based on the entire last year, i don't have much faith in bitcoin
but hey... i'm smart enough to have only invested what i could afford to lose
i will probably lose even more, but i'm choosing to roll the dice and see what happens
even if buying bitcoin was a total suckers bet (which seems to be the case for every single person who bough in 2018, myself included) its cool
my other investments (stocks and real estate) are still doing great, and my regular income is better than ever, so I'll be fine
And whether bitcoin just becomes a flash in the pan that fizzles out and loses me several thousand (which i think is the most likely scenario) or whether it magically comes back and makes me rich (VERY unlikely) at least i gave it a shot.
And investing in a diverse stable of assets, even duds like bitcoin has been to me) is the wisest strategy.
Not every long shot will pan out, but with some off my discretionary income i am willing to give fringe assets like bitcoin a shot.  And if i lose money on bitcoin (which has been the case thus far) so be it, after all... some investments just fail, thats just the nature of making money and investing.

ever since last december, bitcoin has been crashing non-stop
its not only STILL crashing, but crashing even harder now
bitcoin is now a shitcoin
no one respects it, and no one but desperate holders want it
its considered a sucker's bet, and foolish to buy
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:11:54
yes, early adopters did well
that time has long past
but early adopters who are dicks, and gloat as thousands of the rest of us lost most of our investment are the types who people on here (myself included), hate the most.
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:32:45
each one is one bitcoin
meaning, that all 4 are worth about $24k
@_date: 2018-11-28 08:34:47


getting started to go down the toilet, you mean
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:20:54
yes, 
me too.
i still have a few investments with Merrill, but started moving everything over to Vanguard a few years ago.  Best thing I ever did.
Not that I had any issues with Merrill, its just that Vanguard is so much better.  
I hear Charles Schwab is very good, too (I just haven't tried them, as Vanguard has been excellent).
The only real investing disaster I have ever made was investing in bitcoin.  huge losses, but as I only invested what i could afford to lose, I'll be OK.  At this point, I'm just thinking of it as all gone (although, in reality, I still have about 30% of what I started with).  so I'll HODL, and just see what happens on this long-shot gamble called bitcoin.
I am guessing it will go down even more, and never come back... but hey, you never know?!
