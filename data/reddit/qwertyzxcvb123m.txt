Basically when you take an average you are getting a quantity. StDev measures the quality of that quantity..... Not all averages are created equal. So you take the price average over some time and then measure its deviation. Or in other words on average how far off is the average. Volatility is also Plus or Minus as a relative measure. In other words a large  move either way will increase deviation. The daily average of the AdjClose price since inception is $55. The Stdev is 150. So the price is on average $55 plus or minus $150. :) lol... Now thats volatile. Bitcoin has shown almost zero drop in volatility. What people are talking about is how large cap stocks like IBM or RDS behave.

I'm not trying to toy to much, just having fun. I have allot of respect for the guy. In person we would get along great. I don't care if he actually comes out thats why I gave him an out. I do think it would be bad ass for him to send me a .00000001 as a wink. No one outside the circle has been able to get that.

Its invented attacking the creators is of no value..... BitCoin is brilliant he deserves to be recognized. I feel the (coin scam) would be the best way to go as it makes every one put there money where their mouth is. But the other thing you have to consider is once you figure it out its funny as hell. The joke is on you and everyone else. I think he can take it. He's got balls of steel. They have been fucking with you for a long time.

Historically Its important. Sometimes during a revolution you need to sign your John Hancock. I believe the community would support him. But considering his free will. It must be a game.
