Really reddit your going to let a scam site advertise on here?!
This screams scam because the price they are offering is below the exchange value. 
Just remember if its too good to be true don't do it. Its not a good idea to throw good money after bad.

its not nonsense but it probably would be better received else where. I didn't realize just how distant is from Mtgox. All i was trying to do was to inform people and get a laugh or two. The info is true except for the butt raped part. But knowing Americana prisons i would think the likely hood is high.

Haters gonna hate that doesn't mean I'm going to pander to the masses.

It has to do with sentiment. How does bitcoin look if Karpeles doesn't go to prison? Like lawless internet currency.

I don't claim to be a comic genius. You'r obviously a mean spirited asshole so you got that going for you. least I'm trying to make people laugh. Live and learn i'm still an adolescent. I'll figure it out. Cheers
