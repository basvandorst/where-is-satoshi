That graphic is part of a campaign that celebrated the 50th anniversary of the big mac. There were 50 designs that illustrated how the world has changed in 50 years. Cash to Bitcoin was one of them. Another was VHS to MP4, for example.

So, as a long time lurker of this sub, I decided to post a photo and it was the above one. A dumb mistake for sure. But lucky for me, there are very nice people in the world, and in this community, like who took the time to save my ass and wouldn't even accept a finders fee. You, sir, are da real MVP and deserve nothing but good karma to come your way! And please learn from my mistake, fellow newbs!

Bitcoin poetry right here.

This is what the Bitcoin expert at the table said as well. To which the father replied that he was willing to lose it all since they live a minimalist life now and can always start over.

That, sir, was funny.

Most of it was bought around 2700 euro's, so 3140 dollars.
