Thanks for post. We actually have a team and lawyers dedicated to this. The problem isn't the inability to meet any of these regs. The problem is banks flat out saying (and I quote):
"We'd love to work with you as long as you don't include Bitcoin or digital currencies in the currencies that your business will support. We can not be associated with businesses that do so from a regulatory perspective."
We are meeting all of the FinCEN's that we need to. The even larger problem is finding a bank that won't slam the door in our faces just because we deal with BTC in one way or another.

I mentioned the same thing yesterday. It's the biggest problem for this adoption. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:24:24
You'll be able to pay employees either salary or hourly, however, at time of beta launch we won't have an hourly tracker. Although this would be awesome and fairly easy to implement. Employer will have to input the hours worked that month manually at first, but we'll add this too our feature list. +1 awesome idea!
@_date: 2014-06-27 14:58:26
Another developer for Incoin here:
Just to expand on that, we may be able to help you even from the get go. Our goal is to help people get paid in BTC and spread adoption even if your employer doesn't sign up for our payroll side (which won't be ready for the UK immediately). 
We will be ready shortly for any employee to get paid in BTC and all their employer will have to do is change their direct deposit details and then the employee can decide how much to get in they're local currency and how much to get in BTC. The only thing that might he hard is I'm not sure if we will have the currency conversion in place when we launch so you may have to do the math to USD when choosing the ratio of BTC and pounds. 
OR if you want it all in BTC then there shouldn't be any issue at all. 
As far as taxes with this system, your employer should already do the deductions for payroll taxes so you should be covered. 
In the future, as was previously mentioned, we hope to offer the full payroll side to UK employees.

Centralised regulation for a decentralised financial system? That doesn't make any sense.
Hey NYC: Your regulations didn't work during the recession. Why should we allow you to govern the system we came up with when your regulations and system proved to be broken? 
We're using a consent driven network. I, for one, do not give my consent for any of these regulations.

@_date: 2014-06-19 16:21:46
Interesting and you answered a question I just had. I guess it doesn't matter to them where they deposit the money eh. We'll add it to our feature list! I can't guarantee it by beta, but we'll work hard to get it out as soon as possible.

Yes! You hit the nail on the head. We wrote a bit about it on our blog. I think it's an important aspect to promote the ecosystem and the currency as more than a speculative asset: 
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:12:17
I couldn't agree more. It will be amazing. You'll be trading BTC for USD when you need them. Not constantly trying to trade USD for BTC when you need it. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 12:45:01
You're right. I think my next stop after the lawyers this week is going to be a few banks. We have a business account with one bank but I'm not very confident in their integration abilities for something like this. We will probably need to look outside. 
And yes. Either way the money isn't held longer than to confirm ACH. This may be the most simple way for our users. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 13:59:22
We really appreciated your comments and insight. I'm actually going to steal a few of the comments you made for our deck!
And yes. We have already retained legal advice and it hasn't come cheap because the space is filled with challenges and has a lot of regulation that could or could not apply and really it's anyone's guess because this is all so new. 
I'm going to find those speakers as well. Are there any links online?
A few letters from Fincen wouldn't be fun, but sometimes traditional models need someone to come in and break the rules. We just want to make sure we do it in the right way and one that benefits the community. 
Thanks again!

Besides a CDI, he won't need anything. And if he is buying from an individual, not a dealer, then he won't even need a CDI. And that's in a worst case scenario which only serves for the plates and its not like anyone actually checks validity of plates. 
Worst case scenario he needs a cdi and pays a lawyer 500 pesos to get it.

For what it's worth, we had a bank flat out tell us they wouldn't do business with my company because we were a Florida company and fraud is supposedly very high here. We felt it was a crap reason, but it was their reason anyways. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 13:14:34
That's incredible. This is invaluable for us because it's way easier than money being Direct Deposited to our our account with a description identifying the user. It also gives the user more control which we're a huge fan of. 
Thank you very very much.

I had an issue with them opening a corporate account. It took 2 weeks or more to get approved and their customer service was HORRIBLE. it would take over 24 hours to get a response. 
If you hold thousands of dollars of company money then I had better be able to get you on the god damn phone.

I lived in Argentina for a considerable time. First of all when you get to Argentina to purchase a car make sure you exchange your dollars on the black market at the rate typically called "El dolar blue." Last time I checked, the dolar blue was over twice the legal rate. Something like 14 pesos to the dollar. This will give you a lot of leverage when purchasing your car. 
Side note: always only exchange what you need. Inflation is constant so the price you get for dollars now will be less than what you get in 2 months. 
Then when you want to sell your car, I would try pricing it in bitcoin or at least at the price in pesos that you will need to get the bitcoin you desire. Trading for bitcoin will be easier than trading for dollars. I would recommend checking out the expat forums for someone coming down soon who needs pesos for living expenses or even for one big purchase and make the trade with them. Gringos coming down will be more willing to get pesos than Argentines who try to keep their money in anything BUT pesos. You may check local bitcoins and see if there are any sellers, but I would imagine those are few and far between.
Good luck and pm me if you need an exchange location for you dollars at the blue rate in BA. DONT do it on calle Florida. Its shady and likely you'll be taken. Also big bills change at different rates than small bills. Bring hundreds

The regulations just seem geared towards making it difficult for BTC companies and innovation to exist in NYC. IMHO 
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:20:37
That's pretty wild. I'm going to read up later when I have time. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:24:39
We won't have that by beta, BUT you won't know the other's employee's bitcoin addresses and they don't get paid out from a company specific address. We may add mixing measures later, but for now it's anonymous because we act as a mixer of sorts. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:45:53
You're right. The part that's hard there is the added layer of complexity. Plus that may bring in new legal issues which are not fun for a new/young company.

What time? I just got a new puppy  and I have puppy kindergarten in the evening. How late are you guys there? 
Also I think we met one time! I saw the Bitcoin sign. We're right around the corner on 26th street! 
Edit: BTW great work with what you guys are doing promoting btc down here. Very stoked! 
Another edit: I'm the dude with the beard. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:10:31
I know, right? 
I see your point here as well. There are benefits to both options, but of course you're right that setting up another account doesn't eliminate a middle man, but it does allow Incoin to automatically withdrawal and purchase the bitcoin and pay you. 
I wonder if there is a bank out there, that let's you create an account for each user who deposits money with you... 
Any thoughts on how to determine what's more valuable to the community? No need for a Bluebird (or the like) account or having control of the account? The only problem I see with direct deposit to us, is that a user may feel they don't have control. Although of course we would be bound by strict laws and our T&amp;C's with a customer, we do aim for transparency and user control where possible. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 18:11:13
Well 2000 american dollars will only get you around 28000 pesos at the blue rate. You may be able to negotiate a better deal with someone with dollars but I think you're a bit to far off at a 20k peso deficit. Depending on the seller you will have more negotiating power with dollars but they're still going to do the math. I would always bring dollars to a negotiation. If they don't want dollars then give them the price in pesos and exchange them yourself at a great rate.
Short answer: Negotiate with dollars, do the math at the dollar blue, but come closer to the amount they're asking than 20k pesos. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:23:20
Yes. We will provide reporting initially, but we plan to release the filing tax returns and automatic payroll tax payments after the initial launch. The initial system will have the necessities, but it won't be as built out as Zenpayroll for a couple months. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:56:42
Damn. That's a really good idea. And may make it easier for people to adopt it at companies who don't want to switch payroll services or are more conservative. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 15:31:33
That's my biggest problem with them. If you're a financial institution it shouldn't take 3-4 days to find out what's going on with my money. Infuriating and unacceptable 
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:22:59
Thank you! It's actually live in beta right now at [Incoin.io](
We have a lot to add (stuff like automatic tax deductions, etc), but currently it's the perfect system for a small business who's accountant already calculates their employees deductions or for a small business who doesn't want to switch payroll providers but wants to offer their employees bitcoin payroll. 
We're working on integrating taxes now so it will be a full solution for employers. And we're working with banks now so it will be a full solution for anyone regardless of what their company uses. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 12:43:04
Awesome links and advice man. Thanks a lot. Please feel free to email us and keep in touch outside of reddit. Do you mind if I ask what your occupation is? You seem to know a ton about the space and startups in general. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:50:23
I have to agree. One of our portfolio companies is a BTC company and the backhanded tactics used by the majority of banks to edge out competition is phenomenal. Then the regulators scare the rest of them that don't see it as competition to the point of making it insanely difficult for small businesses to get going. 
We've been lucky, but other small companies won't be so fortunate. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 13:11:29
We do. And you're right. It's not quite as straight forward as we'd like. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:22:24
Approaching management is definitely hard. An employer wouldn't have to put too much trust though. We do an ACH debit on their company account for the total of the payroll. ACH system allows for 2 days to report a chargeback so they're protected by that. We have several measures in place to verify their bank account and identity. We would like to create a great explanation for the layman so that more people can invite their employers. Between bank transfer fees and payroll/accounting costs, this would save them money. 
Yes. it would be easy if the whole company would have to use it, but you could also just use it for one offs although it does make your paperwork reside in two locations. 
Well it's dead simple. No more wire transfer fees for each employee. Competitively priced with others in the payroll space. And we'll continue to build features to make it easy for you to pay payroll taxes direct from the app. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:28:10
There seems to be a lot of support for this. We'll put it at the top of our list of to-dos. The only difficulty is identifying the employee being paid in the ACH transaction from the company to us. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 13:08:07
Thanks!

I lived in Argentina for 5 years where there are similar currency and economic problems. I also have a decent amount of insight into Venezuela's problems. I'm a  huge Bitcoin proponent and have been touting it as a solution,  but here is the problem. You have to purchase the btc with something and no one with btc wants to sell it for Bolivars. It's really as simple as that. 
As amazing of a solution as it could be,  the goods shortage they face because of pricing restrictions and currency devaluation is no different when applied to Bitcoin. Specifically that no holder of goods (btc in this example) is willing to trade for a currency that has no value and they can use in relatively few locations for anything besides day to day transactions locally.  
The only way really to solve this problem is find someone foreign who needs a large amount of bolivar to do business of some sort in Vzla. This person/corp would bring down btc instead of dollars to sell at a favourable rate locally.

Ya. I was there and the satellites were cool, but there was no time left for Q&amp;A and I think its still pretty far out. 
Immediately, the payment channels are some of the most useful of implementations he spoke about. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:04:00
You have a great question. One of the features that we're looking to implement is "average bitcoin rate", where employees get paid an average rate for their paycheck's work; this could heavily decrease variance and soften drops in Bitcoin's price. Right now it's just an idea in the pipeline — we really need to test demand and see if people would actually use it.
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:43:54
Fantastic proof of concept. This would be a killer integration and eliminate the need for xapo in locations without btc pos. My google wallet credit card works anywhere.
