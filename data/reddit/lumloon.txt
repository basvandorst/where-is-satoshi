He should not have kept that journal, nor should he have been reckless on where he used the computer.
The FBI got free evidence from him by distracting him with a fake fight:  - This Asian lady then swiped his PC in the blink of an eye

A lot of government reports are free to download online. Why can't we do this with criminal trial transcripts?

Yep! The orders to the agents were to "get the laptop" and not let it close. They succeeded.
I can imagine this being a movie or TV miniseries.

I thought it was interesting how they busted him, not giving him a chance to encrypt his laptop

I read the Wired article about how the FBI did a clever trick to get him off guard. This Asian lady swiped his computer while he was distracted by a staged fight

The story of how it was seized was amazeballs

The guys who busted him wanted to make sure he couldnt encrypt his laptop  - they had an asian lady snatch his laptop while he was distracted

In the world of the drug trade you can't go to the police for certain disputes. Sadly at least initially DPR was pretty much goaded into calling a hit. This wasn't some guy doing an annoying behavior; he was threatening to expose a list of clients to damage a business.

They were indeed trying to trap DPR into committing more crimes and/or trying to get money out of him

I don't think good time will shave off that much of his sentence.
