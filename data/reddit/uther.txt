Businesses that were built around Bitcoin four years ago are hampering those scaling efforts. It's kind of like the big oil companies dealing with renewable energy. They will slow adoption of a more efficient business model because they want to get a good return on the original plan.

To me any other alt coin is an attack on digital scarcity. The more there are the more this proves all of the skeptics right. And furthermore, if Bitcoin is displaced by another alt coin, then the store of value proposition is destroyed as well; there will always be the next coin. It has to be Bitcoin, or it’s none. But newcomers want to make money and that’s fine, but hopefully the money they make is absorbed into Bitcoin. The approval of an ETF will probably encourage this.

For me the disappointing thing was how fast he went back on his word. Yes, I’m sure we was watching Binance rise up and making mad gains on alts but I thought he was better than that. And then for him to add BCash and the way it all went down... can’t he see alts like BCash are just another attack vector on Bitcoin? As a long term hodler it was all just a big slap in the face.

Oh yeah, AWD model is a rocket. That would be great if Tesla accepted bitcoin. Elon was completely ignorant about it when asked, although I'm sure he he's looking into it now.
I hear you, I have a few coins as well. If all goes well, I plan to buy the cheaper unannounced model in a few years.
But aside from this, I really do think a redistribution of wealth is needed to help correct the way our society is being influenced. I'm happy to see you're into renewable energy.

There’s been a lot of talk about artificial intelligence being able to do most of our jobs. I’m hoping someone can develop a use case for basic income using bitcoin. Call it “Good Citizen”. People can apply for it and receive a monthly income by being healthy, purchasing less wasteful products, and conserving energy. This can be tracked by purchases made, wearable tech and power bills. The better the citizen, the more funds are awarded. Not only would this help with the impending doom of our healthcare system, you'd also save the planet as well.
