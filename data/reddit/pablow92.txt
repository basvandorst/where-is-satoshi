So glad you haven't lost everything. Hope everything gets better for you man.
I just bought a fire proof safe box =)
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:17:19
That's out of the question. But most wallets and services are not using SegWit, and there's nothing we can do about it at the time being
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:14:14
I love this list
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:12:39
How is the boycott working so far? C'mon, I'm not going to the streets to protest Coinbase. This is war, and people do anything to succeed. It's a free market and you can't do anything about it. We have to win by being superior, not boycotting anything
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:13:50
I can smell the fear
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:25:25
Well to be completely fair, Coinbase is kind of a fraud this days lol
@_date: 2015-06-15 05:36:31
Explain me like I'm 5: It IS scarce right? I had this discussion the other day and couldn't give a right response. What should I say?
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:14:01
also banksi means "bankyes" in spanish, so you have that too.
@_date: 2014-12-03 02:43:47
Will you make Trezor cheaper so everyone can afford it?
@_date: 2014-09-22 06:56:31
you can't pay your taxes with IT Crowd
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:54:39
If I'm using Armory, do I need to update my bitcoinq?
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:22:10
I agree. I love my Trezor, but better materials would sure help bring more "peace of mind" as they say.
I would buy another one for sure!
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:57:10
More like TheDAO
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:20:01
I moved to Samourai because Mycelium had no SegWit. Now moving back to Mycelium because Samourai has no BTC rate conversion.
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:03:45
Yes, I have the same thought. I'm in this for a few years now, and this is the first time I fear Bitcoin might be losing its track. I dont have any actual experience with SegWit or LN. I really hope it works, because if it doesn't there are plenty of other capable cryptos waiting for people to migrate.
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:11:33
I can't see it in the original tweet
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:45:41
Not right now. First, not everyone there has internet, or smarphones. Second, fees are high. Lowest fee on Mycelium wallet is around 1 dollar, that is A LOT of money. To give you an idea, 100 dollars per month is a managers salary.
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:53:13
Mycelium's UX is far better
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:23:40
I don't understand why most wallets took out entirely the option to manually choose the fee
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:24:55
Just because other people are doing the work doesn't mean the work is done by itself
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:52:35
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:52:54
What about a graph?
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:02:28
We do owe them. Just not with money, but yes, we totally owe them respect.
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:25:26
No. Not this one, not greta. Stop using kids.
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:54:07
same here
@_date: 2019-06-09 14:34:24
you clearly know nothing about argentina
@_date: 2015-08-28 21:51:03
I hate that physical coin image. It just makes things more confusing for outside people
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:01:19
But what about keeping bitcoin decentralized?
@_date: 2015-08-03 12:10:06
I think you are talking about the Venezulan guy. Here in Argentina there are very few individuals who still mine. Electricity costs.
@_date: 2015-08-19 04:17:55
Maybe I still don't have a real notion of my own money, but after being a Bitcoin user since 2011 with all the crashes and stuff, I don't feel anything at all about this. Except for the fork thing, that does concern me.
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:52:04
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:22:43
I just wish they say something more concrete. All their communications recently are vague, and you only see them talking good things about the actual chain of BTC, which is fine, but I want to rest assured my money is the primary focus, so I would like to know if they have real intentions to provide a splitting tool ASAP if it becomes possible.
I've been a Trezor user for 2 years now, but this makes me want look at Ledger for getting more peace of mind...
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:11:14
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:06:23
It's actually a good sign that they are not political in this matter. A better move would be to delete both links. There is no official Bitcoin website.
@_date: 2015-08-09 03:24:03
I would think that clients of bitcoin start-ups prefer a stable price rather than a high one
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:20:54
Ask your accountant lol
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:58:12
We only had BCH fork, and it had replay protection. This doesn't
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:13:07
Yep. I'm still not sure about the larger blocks, but I do hate these intolerant mods.
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:05:28
I don't think you are understanding the technical dangers this fork may cause. Coins getting lost by sending one fork and spending the other, bad split techniques that end up being lost coins, and a lot other shit
@_date: 2015-08-07 21:44:55
Here you can find some of the talks in youtube videos:
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:08:10
Bitcoin is still seen more as a store of value than a currency for daily use, so it makes more sense to keep calling the BTC price imho
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:21:36
Thanks for hearing out
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:36:43
Yep, forgot to mention that. Edited op
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:28:06
You know what, you can keep that air you're breathing. FOR NOW, only cause I like you.
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:53:15
That sucks. I really liked Coindesk. Actually the only bitcoin news site that looks good and it's built like a nice news website should be. Too bad...
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:17:54
It looks nice. But right now I'm more worried about what they will do with Segwit2x as they haven't announced a clear position yet. I wish they could just assure their users that they will promise to work on a splitting tool as soon as it is possible.
@_date: 2019-12-10 12:23:28
No, it's not a company
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:44:26
Gracias che
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:25:35
I think it's a good thing. Sooner or later they will want to be involved, and it's best they know the best way to do it, talking with the bitcoin community, so they understand why it is a good thing to have Bitcoin around.
The bad things they will learn them for sure by themselves. But this way they will probably understand all in all that there is more pros than cons.
@_date: 2015-07-03 06:15:18
They do the same with Spanish. I hate when websites do that. Specially IMDB, which changes the movie titles to the stupid "translations" they make here
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:35:46
Pretty weak article to be honest. No proof whatsover. Not that I like Bitmain or anything like that, but this is just pure FUD...
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:59:44
This should be the default setting on every wallet. If Mycelium+Jaxx+Breadwallet would do it, plus major exchanges it should correct the issue.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:07:49
This is how I like my jokes
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:34:32
So you can actually spend btc in a wallet if you find the private key that's suits the address where they are, even if it is a different private key? I didn't always fully understand this.
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:54:08
I LODL
@_date: 2017-09-20 03:45:17
Did you make the script yourself or is it something I can download and use in my own site? It's a cool way to generate revenue, but it would be nice to tell the users what's happening behind. I'm sure most would appreciate that before a site full of ads.
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:25:41
Basic security:
1) Keep your Bitcoins in a wallet where you own your private key! What's the point of cryptocurrency if not holding your own money without trusting anyone else...
2) If you HAVE to hold your btc in an exchange ALWAYS use 2FA. And this goes for any sensitive account, such as your email which was probably hacked to.
Your life is not over. See it as a clean slate to start over with more strength than before. Get a job and buy the dips with your salary.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:19:49
About time!! I had to pay 1 USD to send 1 usd the other day... I was honestly about to change wallet. I really like Mycelium
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:16:26
yes, it has improved. but the default normal fee is still expensive. we should lower down the standard to see any actual changes
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:37:05
I'd like to win Bitcoin Miner T-Shirt, Gray, M. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:10:48
Or maybe just cover the thing and look over your shoulder first. No, but really, it would be messy
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:14:20
Iota is also centralized. Just google 'coordinator node'
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:14:36
No, 1 usd is not cheap at all, and even worse if you want to send 1 usd, it's just plain stupid. Bitcoin, as I understand from its original mission and possibilities, is meant to be used for micro transactions. Micro transactions meaning fees of just a few cents or even less. But things have changed though, so who knows now..
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:31:43
As someone who has been in crypto long enough, we should aim for both.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:20:40
Oh yes, it is a cheap amount to send. It was a gift to someone to show him how Bitcoin works. I had to pay double because of the ridiculous fees, sadly. But I'm glad to know this should be changing soon. I still think Bitcoin should be used to make 1 usd transactions nevertheless, and fees should be worth a cent or less, and maybe only more if you are sending big amounts. I know there are alt coins that aim to these, but I still don't see why Bitcoin can't be used like this, like it was already.
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:02:03
Tell them it's a Bitcoin sell and pay taxes for it
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:05:53
Some think it should be increased and some don't. I would say we should keep the 1mb for a while now and see what happens with the SegWit technology as it is.  We already have BCH to test what happens with a bigger block Bitcoin version. Doesn't make any sense to rush another increase in top of the SegWit, imho. I'm not a developer though, so I don't really understand how is it all implemented.
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:16:42
Not the same at all
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:11:37
I'm only worried about the capability of the 12 word seed Mycelium provides being used in other wallets. Should I not worry about this?
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:04:53
And now I know of the existence of this country because of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:35:13
I would put this in a glass emergency box with a lock and open it to drink every +1000$ valuation
@_date: 2017-10-09 06:54:12
You are right. But I don't think this guy can achieve that same thing
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:46:43
Where exactly?
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:22:44
I'm surprised someone in the CEO of position of such an important company is able to claim such silly statements. Same thing with Jamie Dimon. Do they really think their claim is going to help them with something else than making them look stupid?

@_date: 2017-07-08 00:03:04
but like ETC with ETH, one of this is worth very little. how can i assure myself i will not end up with the worst fork around, speaking purely about market value.
@_date: 2017-07-03 23:50:02
Please explain me in simple words why would you prefer to use a sidechain instead of a bigger main chain which you already know you can trust.
@_date: 2017-07-06 03:00:24
This is a very interesting topic. How would you justify the income if you just mined the coins and then sold them in LBC, Coinbase or anywhere else?
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:51:51
You seem to know about /btc, so the only thing limiting yourself from really understanding why SW poses a real threat is your will to read more. Have you read ANYTHING about Blockstream yet?
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:36:10
Well, I don't actually *hold* any Bitcoins, just some private keys..
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:44:16
It's incredible how we bare with these stupid laws everyday like a normal thing. I don't fully realize how fucked up we are until I read things like this. Makes me wonder if I really want to spend the rest of my life here...
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:15:25
Couldn't help and read it with the voice of Andreas Antonopoulos screaming all of it out loud. Great post!
