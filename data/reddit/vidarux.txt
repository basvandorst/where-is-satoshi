I mean, it seems like you are the person we're talking about. From quickly scanning your history it confirms as though that's the case. I wouldn't describe the way you used to speak as extremely polite, anyone who had an experience with you would probably agree there. You definitely called people names or questioned peoples intelligence and suggested they were lacking. In all honesty, I disagree with you on many issues, including the outlandish claims for bitcoin dying. It sucks you got banned, I would like to know why though before forming any opinion on it.
Unfortunately it seems like you're now peddling that this happened to a bunch of bears, I'd say this is nothing more than a conspiracy theory at the moment and you have a burden of proof before this becomes a feasible theory.

@_date: 2018-09-01 11:35:01
That’s true, I did assume gender. My apologies. 
However, the method of log scaling that you’re describing does not work for determining the relative position of where bitcoins current price is compared to now on the McAfee dick line. It’s 57% below that curve line, no matter the scale. That’s numbers, you can’t fake them. Log charts are used to show relative increments because in finance the move from $1.00 to $2.00 is the same as €1,000 to $2,000. However that move is still a 100% increment. No amount of charting can change that.
I can see where the confusion lies so I do apologise for being blunt. Hopefully the time I’ve taken to explain will be enough to redeem myself.

It's probably very difficult to detect that without the use of AI and hooking up to the Coinbase web socket. In theory though this could be achieved and you could determine when price was being manipulated. However, it's quite hard to know what the intention is behind the manipulator and whether it's an individual actor or if it's perhaps the exchange.

Yeah, it started around the time of the sell off. It's a good way to give support or resistance to a price point, so they're trying to manipulate it a certain way. They're probably used in conjunction with any larger Bitmex longs / shorts that they're opening and closing.

I don't remember him being completely polite though and a quick scan of his post history definitely shows some questionable comments on I also had a couple of issues with his predictions which I feel are low quality posts. I have even called him out a couple of times on his posts. 
However, I don't agree with censorship or banning, same as I don't agree with misinformation or alternative facts. There are at least two sides to every story however and I would rather the full story as to why he was banned (if he was) than rather assuming it was because he was simply bearish. I therefore can't offer an opinion on that until I'm given the facts. 
Thus, I would suggest it would be more prudent to not assume that anyone who was bearish has been banned without any supporting evidence.

But the energy isn't currently from 100% eco-friendly sources, so this is something people should and will care about. It's all good looking at hypotheticals but something does need to be done about it. I'm all for going after the energy providers but miners can opt to use eco friendly providers as well. You've also got to look at the general public who won't buy in to Bitcoin because of this problem. There is a green revolution happening and bitcoin could lose out because of it.

Yes, after because of bots and stop losses that close their long positions.
You don't understand inflation, if you're printing tether and trading with yourself, the value of tether would decrease. Bitfinex would lose money. In addition why would they print tether to trade with themselves when they could just trade with themselves anyway and then print tether to cover the cost when users withdraw? Instead they would leave a semi smoking gun for conspiracy theorists such as yourself to find?
You're lacking in some fundamental understandings of market dynamics and game theory to be saying silly accusations. I think we're done here.

Europe is good within Europe. SEPA still takes a number of days to process whereas bitcoin, as you said, is an hour. SEPA requires a number of different bank details and numbers that aren't checksummed or validated. Bitcoin addresses are checksummed and are used once,  nice for privacy and validation. Paypal takes up to 10% fee sometimes whereas bitcoin fee's are (currently) minimal. If this product is not worth anything as you said why is it currently being valued in order of magnitude of 1e3, with around 1k transactions every 10 minutes?

Not as much really. I don't see much reason to leave your money in Tether if you're planning to cash out to fiat. You're locking it up in crypto when you could reinvest it elsewhere. I'm sure there is potential for a number of investors to cash out into fiat if the price of btc decays to lower than $1,000, but the likelihood of that happening seems rather low imho.

People who sell usually are one of three mentalities:
• If I sell now, I can buy more later.
• If I sell now, I can buy back later and keep the profit. 
• If I sell now, I can keep the profit.
I believe most of the time people will buy back. That means that the price will eventually rise again as people come back to Bitcoin. The hurt that most people feel when they hodl is that their current position could be attained with a lot less capital, or they could have a greater position. It sucks, but it'll always happen. You've just got to be happy with the position you have or accumulate more.

That's known as timing the bottom. You could sell and the market turns around, thus you end up with 80 dollars of bitcoin instead of the 100 you had. You have to beat 50% of other traders in order to be successful at that strategy, it's not something you can just 'do'. It takes a lot of practice, knowledge and luck. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 11:17:34
Almost. For the market cap to be considered in CMC they have to have a minimum daily volume and be on some reputable exchanges. Yes the volume can be faked but it does prevent some bloating. Also, the fact that Bitcoin has 50% despite this bloating from less volume coins is impressive. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 10:56:15
Now he knows we’re watching.
@_date: 2018-08-22 10:35:30
Okay, I see you're missing the point so I'll try and explain carefully.
More tether has been created now, because more people have cashed out from bitcoin into tether.
When bitcoin's market cap was high. More people had moved from fiat/tether into bitcoin.
In order for tether to remain at $1. It needs to print more when the demand is higher, and burn more when the demand is lower. There is a higher demand now for tether than when Bitcoin was at ATH.
Remember, when demand &gt; supply, the price rises. When supply &gt; demand, the price decreases. That's economics 101.
That's why there is more tether now than when bitcoin was at it's ATH.
@_date: 2018-08-11 22:13:06
I remember when your ceiling was 7300. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:12:12
The key is to remember market cap isn't the amount of money that has entered the market but the value of the last purchase \* supply. 
With Tether this has a different meaning as Tether is "guaranteed" to be 1:1 with the USD. That means any value transfer will have a greater effect on bitcoin price. To push the price to $10k per BTC it only takes a purchase of 4k bitcoin on coinbase pro. Plus there's the chance of a chain effect occurring pushing the price further. 
The Tether time bomb will be the start of the bull run. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 11:23:07
You've been saying 5k for months, now you're 6.5k? Does this mean bull run???
@_date: 2018-08-22 10:30:13
1/ People are selling bitcoin when the price goes up, they're selling at an increased price. The amount of tether in circulation can increase during an upwards movement. Tether is basically a substitute for USD, and is preventing people from selling for USD and instead selling for Tether. The number of tether increased before the price rose. Tether is reactionary, so it would have been increased most likely due to the record high of shorts and people cashing out into tether. 
2/ Can you explain logically why this should happen at the same time or after?
I add my own proposition. If exchanges were making illegitimate trades (which they are, to give fake volume) why would they do it on a block chain where everything is tracked? They do it on their own internal database. This is the number 1 reason why the FUD is a conspiracy. If exchanges are manipulating price, they don't need Tether to do so and they won't be using it, they control all of the coins of their exchange so they can manipulate as they like. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 10:38:29

Why? Third place sucks. Do better.
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:58:51
Lol. You're really clueless.
When BTC's price starts dropping Bitfinex "print" more tether because more people are moving in to it, thus the demand of tether increases, in order to keep the price at $1.00 you need to increase the supply. How do you increase the supply? You print more tether.
Tether isn't propping up the price, it makes no sense that people selling bitcoin would prop the price up. Clearly you're missing something very fundamental about how market dynamics work.
Please tell me you don't actually believe that a "printed" currency is keeping bitcoin afloat. Who is accepting this printing currency in order to keep the price of bitcoin high?
This is the poorest FUD out there and is akin to flat earth theory and other such hogwash.
Edit - You literally just said that when the price drops more tether is printed. That seems like the more tether there are the more bitcoin price decreases. Please think about your own statement.
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:58:46
We’d be here all day in that case, and yes all of those things need to change, but that’s not the topic at discussion. We’re specifically responding to a thread on banks vs Bitcoin energy usage. 
Without shilling other coins there are other projects that are trying to solve the energy usage whilst still being secure.
I think your overt defense of Bitcoin is limiting in looking at potential future solutions. Drowning out a discussion on what could be bitcoins biggest issue for becoming mass adopted isn’t the wisest nor brightest move in my opinion. As I said, I’m heavily invested and for the most part look very favourably towards bitcoin’s features, energy consumption, however, is a concern.
@_date: 2018-08-12 11:15:40
It’s sentiment and sentiment alone. Bcash itself has been dropping faster than bitcoin. People need time to get used to the idea of bitcoin being worth 5-6K or wherever the bottom is. When it rose to 19K only FOMO drove that price. It didn’t hold because the masses didn’t value it as 19K.

@_date: 2018-08-09 19:18:06
10 Million Bitcoin is 58% of the current Bitcoin supply? I'm not even sure if that much is on exchanges.
I think you've made the mistake of looking at market cap as total money spent on bitcoin. Market cap is just the last sale price * supply. Liquidity is the important factor here. If you look at the depth chart on an exchange, it will tell you how much it would cost and at what price you could buy 4k BTC at. My numbers were taken from Coinbase Pro at the time of writing. I'm happy to explain further if you would like as I think you've made a few misunderstandings. 
Tether is $2.4 billion stored in Crypto but not contributing to the price of bitcoin. Of all of the money from Tether went into Bitcoin at once, it would increase the BTC market cap much higher than $2.4 billion due to liquidity and slippage.
edit - I just checked on Coinbase Pro. To purchase 4k Bitcoin using a market order would cost $33 Million and would push the price up to 10k per BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:53:40
Tether has 400k worth of bitcoin currently stored in it's value. I'm pretty sure everyone who owns Tether is intending to come back to Bitcoin. Just chill people, the market is doing fine.

It could probably be debated and studied of when the peak of tether amount should be. My personal belief (but could be incorrect) is that peak tether will be before the next bull run, as everyone who has sold into tether will have done so by that point. 
Whilst volume may have been higher then, there are probably still people who remain in tether from that time waiting for a certain price point (probably 5k) before buying back in. Therefore keeping the amount of tether high whilst not contributing to any volume. 
Tether is an interesting beast in itself. I don’t believe it will cause the death of Bitcoin as some people would have us believe on here. I instead believe it adds selling pressure to Bitcoin and keeps the price down that way.
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:22:46

It would probably cause the price to increase because of game theory. Anyone who wants an order below that price would increase to slightly above. The order most likely wouldn’t be filled but would act as a rock solid support. However, this wouldn’t happen in real life if you wanted to purchase 2k BTC.

@_date: 2018-08-13 16:41:21
Yes, that's how tether works. Tether is designed to be at $1 per Tether. The way to do that is to keep the market cap at the same trading volume, but increasing and decreasing the supply to demand. 
Using the word moron when you don't understand how something works is pretty indicative of your willingness to understand. 
What do you think happens when the market cap of tether goes down? That means people are moving out of tether and back in to crypto. This isn't that hard to comprehend.

Mental gymnastics there, buddy. There's no central authority (i.e. insurance company) that has to cover the cost of unhealthy individuals as the healthy individuals, who add to the pool, leave the system. There's no margin call for holders to sell. Why are you defending a poor analogy?

Woah, no need for accusations on ones knowledge, Mr "thousands of dead programming languages". I was just highlighting an interesting coincidence. Why would someone get super defensive about that, I wonder?
Wikipedia for you: [

You never responded to my response about rai stones and where value is derived from. Did you end up reading any material related to how value is defined especially in the form of the exchange?
The Bike was, and is, worth 1 BTC. If the bike was worth $8,000 USD then it would have been sold for $8,000 USD. Your failure or grasp basic economics or, as is more likely, intentional misinformation, show that you have intentions of spreading fear through uncertainty and doubt. In reality, you're just giving a prime example of a constant and common attack on Bitcoin.

You need to read some books about value. In particular start reading about rai stones and their use as a monetary system in Yap.
Value exists because humans place value on possession, that's it. Sure, there are factors such as usefulness, cost to create and summation of parts, but they all affect value rather than create it. In reality, nothing has value except to the beholder and the society/community the beholder is in.
It's clear Bitcoin has no value to you, but you lack imagination if you say it has no value to others.

What about the scientists who believe in the future potential of a decentralised and scarce store of value which can’t be forged, taken or censored and yet can be transferred across the world in less than an hour? 
Why not own some of this and still do something useful in life?
These are not mutually exclusive options which shows me your limited thought capacity and lack of aptitude.

There's actually some good debates between your thought process and the taxation is theft process as well. Whilst there is a social contract, the issue stems from the fact you can't opt out of this contract, without suffering arrest and imprisonment. 
There's a thought experiment called, "How many people" that delves into when the situation transitions from theft into taxation. Whilst I don't fully subscribe to libertarianism, I certainly don't support some of the uses that taxed money is put to, such as war, murder, government bailouts and boomer pensions. Personally I believe the money could be better spent on education, safety, shelter and food.

This situation is so circumstantial that your comment doesn't make much sense. If your money is stolen from your pocket whilst walking down a street then there's pretty much no recourse in retrieving those funds, same if it was scammed by anyone with half an idea how to hide their identity. These are the same for bitcoin in their relevant areas. Now, if someone steals your bitcoin and sends it to an address that has been used with an exchange, then you suddenly have recourse in order to retrieve your property and identify the scoundrels.

@_date: 2018-12-12 22:06:22
I’ve already queried those points with you, which you had no response to. 
I think the power use is an issue, but it’s no worse than the power usage of other things that have value. 
You really don’t value the bigger picture. The term can’t see the forest for the trees is applicable to your run down. If you want those things, use venmo or Paypal. If they shut off your account and you can no longer accept payments for things, maybe you’ll have a rethink or two.

Why do you think it’s poorly engineered? Have you taken a look at the source code? It’s not my personal coding style but the core concepts are backed by decades of research. It’s also implementation independent so it’s free for anyone to reengineer.

I just asked for a explanation as to why you have contradictory statements. Your failure to do that is deeply concerning and suggests some sort of cover up. It’s also concerning how you’re trying to change the direction of the conversation. I’ll make sure I keep a record of this for the future.

Bitcoin has been in use since its invention?
The three features you listed aren’t lies.
If I send you a bunch of BTC addresses can you tell me who they belong to?
Can you get a judge to freeze my BTC addresses?
Can you tell me how many USD were printed today?
Can you send me millions of dollars in an hour with no checks and proof of identification other than a cryptographic signature?
You, sir, are wrong and lacking in imagination. 
Encryption has been in use since its invention. But it’s certainly not been mainstream usage for 100’s of years until probably 5 years ago. It was mainly used by the state and hobbyists up until then. 
Your criticisms give way when you make outrageous and emotional statements. 
The world has not rejected Bitcoin. This isn’t Facebook, or Paypal, or eBay.  This is akin to separation of church and state and the iceberg that was the printing press.
Heck, even computers weren’t mainstream for decades.
Bitcoin has been around 10 years and has more users than the computer did back in 1946 (1936 was when the first functional computer was built)

That’s not my argument. 
I only gave examples to your question. Radio waves took a long time to become mainstream. I would say that consuming via TV and radio is only half of the definition.  Now with data transfer via WiFi and Bluetooth is when we have full mainstream adoption.
Cryptography and encryption is the same. Now that we are using TLS and full disk encryption by the high majority of the western population is what I would consider mainstream.
