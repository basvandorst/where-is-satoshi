if you have 0.1BTC and the price is $10,000 the value of your coin is 0.1 x 10,000 = $1,000 does this make sense? 
so for the same amount of bitcoin but the price has risen to $12,000, your 0.1BTC is worth 0.1 x 12,000 = $1,200
is this what you are asking?

It's not just the large drops, all the small fluctuations seem to be closely linked

but is there some sort of "calculator" or "app" which can do this /s

when you see the price of a bitcoin written as X amount of USD, this is the price for exactly 1 whole bitcoin, so if you have half a bitcoin you can half this advertised price for a whole bitcoin to get your value, and of course this works for much smaller values also

What makes the price graphs for BTC ETH and LTC so correlated? It makes sense that the prices have similar performance, but they have the same shaped dips and changes so consistently over the course of a day happening at the same time, it seems weird that they are so closely linked
