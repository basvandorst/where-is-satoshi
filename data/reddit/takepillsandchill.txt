I'm also fairly new but here is what I've learned:
1. Other than mining, you profit by buying and selling bitcoin. There are many ways to do this. I use coinbase/gdax. Look up some tutorials first before you put money in.
2. I started with $100. You can start with whatever you want, but just look very closely at the fees. Depending on how you pay and what service you use, it could be to your disadvantage to put in very small amounts.
3. not sure
4. absolutely not too late. the price is around $7,000 US dollars per bitcoin right now, and some people say it's going to go much higher. Also, there is a big change happening soon on November 16th, which will have a number of effects(look up Segwit2X). The price will move one way or the other, and with movement comes the possibility to make money on that movement. 
Good luck and have fun learning!

@_date: 2017-11-09 00:43:07

@_date: 2017-11-08 04:34:13
but what if I forget to HODL????

great question. Mine is supposed to arrive approx 24hr before the fork(nov 15), but they are also stopping trading at that time. hoping I will not get screwed out of my free coin somehow

you have a link to the article about gdax halting trades? thanks for the info

I was under the impression there would be a big dip sometime before the fork. Maybe I was misinformed or assumed something incorrectly? Having my money stuck in processing could cause me to loose out buying lots of btc during a dip, but now people seem to be saying it's just going to ramp up before the fork, so I might be in the clear. Still new to this and learning how to navigate.

if Coinbase is hacked then so many people are fucked
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:39:57
Yeah, I'm not even gonna try calling, I know what the answer will be
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:28:09
that is insane. sounds almost too good to be true. i have a flight to mexico approx 24 hours after the fork. hope to god they have wifi
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:24:56
what about the big dip that's supposed to put BTC at like 5500? is that supposed to happen during the fork?

if you don't already know, gdax is kinda like the free version of coinbase, and since its the same company, you already have an account. go to gdax.com and transfer money from coinbase(free), then you can buy and sell BTC to your hearts content for free(as long as you doing it using 'limit orders' and not market orders. look up the difference online). There are still fees for taking your money completely out of coinbase/gdax, but you can buy and sell for free within the system if you want. check out a gdax tutorial. apologies if you already know all this.

I realize that... just wondering if the price will drop severely BEFORE the fork because everyone is freaked out, and if so, how long before? Just hoping I'll have access to my BTC when it happens

thank you. looks like I gotta do more reading, more research! so much to learn!
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:11:01
nah man ima hodl
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:09:32
that would be siiiiick! free coins? could you ELI5 that to me?
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:47:06
fingers crossed on the timing. When I sell you think I should get my money out of GDAX even? They have a USD wallet so should't I be safe to hold there until I want to buy back BTC? Or is the whole system going to melt down and crash armageddon style?

This is GREAT advice. I have a very addictive personality(recovering addict). I've been cooped up in my room last couple nights glued to gdax. I'm slowly realizing I'm spending all my time off doing this shit rather than just enjoying my life. If I was making boatloads of cash then maaaaybe. But I'm not. I should just hodl and go on a freakin hike or something.

There once was a show called Dinosaurs and in it there was a joke where the family on the show had their house destroyed by a meteorite. But they had meteor insurance, so they thought they were fine! The insurance company guy came to their house and explained that they have METEOR insurance, not METEORITE insurance. Once a meteor came into earths atmosphere it became a meteorite, voiding the claim.

I believe in it's potential 100%. And I'm all for supporting it. Now, how much do I want to risk supporting it, that is the question we must ask ourselves. I want to save the whales too but I'm not about to go and donate 20% of my savings to it.
