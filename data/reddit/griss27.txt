Lol, it was a big deal when we got our first fiat ATM around here. To put it in context - we still don't have our first set of traffic lights. We are a bit behind the times.
To be fair, it's just as hard to invest my money in ANYTHING, not just bitcoin. Everyone around here invests in local real estate, because it's easy and the returns are excellent with the airbnb effect skyrocketing prices on beachfront property.

Not without jumping through a whole set of anti-money laundering hoops, apparently. 
They just don't trust large amounts of money that came from the Caribbean, I guess. Same as the exchanges!
It's like damn you people I earned this money working a boring 9 to 5 job!

I won't buy p2p until I'm used to dealing with bitcoin / wallets etc. Too risky. Need to get my legs first.
Also, [localbitcoins.com]( shows no one in my country trading.
Longer term, though, good idea.

This is me, but not through my own fault. Wanted to buy between 10 to 20 BTC at 4k, couldn't due to no exchanges accepting payments from banks in my country. So I recently went to Europe where I have family and set up an account there. Then when I tried to buy crypto from that account the fucking Bank wouldn't let me due to AML process and source of funds requests and all kinds of shit. 
Now trying to buy in at 12k. Bank still won't let me. Now they're saying I needed a hardware authenticator to send SEPA payments, but they won't send it to the remote country where I live. FML. Maybe it'll fall for a while and this will work in my favour this time but thinking that I could have tripled my money is driving me absolutely spare. If it goes to 30k or above and I still wasn't able to buy in... fuck me.
I may actually have to give money to a relative and have them invest it for me - but none of them is capable of that, let alone the enormous trust / security issues it gives rise to.

Wanted to put six figures into Bitcoin back when it was 3.5k, (even posted here!) but couldn't figure out how because I live on a tiny Caribbean island and moving money anywhere is an AML nightmare and crypto sites don't accept signups from here. Feel so upset now.
At least I told people I knew that I was trying to do it, so I can share my misery, but it hurts. I could be buying a house rather than renting right now.

Does anyone know how to buy coins for those of us in smaller countries? I'm in the Bahamas myself and I don't think Coinbase accepts accounts from here.
How do non-USA/Canada and non-European people get in on this?

I answered yes to all these, but I'm fucked if I can figure out how to buy it. Have wanted to for a couple of years now.
(Basically, all my money is in a Caribbean bank, no exchanges will accept money from my location, there are no local idea how to move it due to strict AML / KYC policies in foreign banks and I'm not willing to deal with individuals over the internet due to scam risks).
So frustrating.

From 2011 onwards I wanted to invest in Bitcoin but was broke, unemployed and it was impossible. Never had more than 1k to my name until 2015, was frustrating as hell. Every penny mattered.
Then in 2017 it finally became possible but it was obviously too late - irrational exuberance had already taken hold. I told myself I'd buy in if it ever dropped to $2k, safe in the knowledge it probably wouldn't.  
But now here we are, it's a real possibility. I've got 50k that I could afford to lose without affecting my quality of life and if the price goes to 2k I will have a real decision to make. Risk a lot of money or risk living with regret again. I can't be the only no-coiner hanging around thinking like this.
