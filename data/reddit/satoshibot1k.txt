You already know the answer. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:32:57
.............. no shit. There's such a better working version atm. Everyone is fucking blind because they have money in bitcoin instead. Investment bias... OPEN YOUR EYES HOLY SHIT. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:46:11
Load up boys. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:37:08
The news is true they did stop accepting and most merchants have stopped accepting bitcoin. Why? Because users are too stupid to realize that they need to use another coin to transfer their btc. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:44:25
I'm talking about bitcoin. Are you drunk. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:39:22
I'm shocked people are just now waking up to this... What did you expect? To Hold the coin and never use it because the fees were so high? WTF? Does that even make any logical sense. Greedy fuckers ruined this coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:45:26
dumb ass. lol 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:35:26
Cough why not use the b****** C***
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:48:26
Crypto got invaded by all these get rich people. They don't care for the tech. They just want money and will attack any opposing views. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:12:10
Why are we posting fake crap on bitcoin cash? Is this community scared? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:10:33
You obviously have a crystal ball because it can't be sustainable... lmao. Bitcoin cash is working today unlike bitcoin and waiting around for lightning will only bring you disappointment. Do your research.

It is actually very easy for government agencies to follow the money flow using bitcoin's fully transparent blockchain. Even if you use different wallets and try to obfuscate the transactions it is still possible for them to put a face on the wallet addresses. Remember every penny is being recorded on the blockchain and available for everyone to see. I would not be surprised if the government has already developed tools to trace and link transactions for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-14 23:02:18
China's official digital currency this must be a joke, like shutting down bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-11-13 22:25:43
You could actually look at other promising blockchain projects. Of course be wary that alot of these are just pump and dump schemes to steal your coins. However, there are a few gems out there, you just need to do some due diligence before investing. Good Luck! 
@_date: 2016-11-24 03:38:13
Lol bitcoin... that is what happens when you can't reach a consensus. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 21:05:19
If you had only invested in Bitcoin way back then when it was a penny. If only you had invested in stocks back before you were born. 
Man, if only... if only. I never understood why people think about what they could have done instead of what they should be doing now. But I guess it is always interesting to look back at the past and think about how things could have went a different way. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 05:17:16
That much mining power in the hands of a few is worrisome. It's not that you are growing in the bitcoin mining industry its that you could upset the balance of mining power. If a 51% attack does happen those miners can basically choose what transactions they want to include and double spend on the blockchain. This of course ruins the bitcoin currency value as people don't trust it anymore so miners are discouraged from gaining over 50% of the mining power. However, if money was not the motivation of the miner then that could be troubling. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 05:05:21
Yeah impossible, bitcoin mining is very centralized and costly. You can mine for fun but I doubt you'll make your money back in less than 1 year. If you are looking to get bitcoins it would be better to just buy them with fiat. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:23:32
Simple, close down the exchanges. They have threatened to before why not do it again.
@_date: 2016-11-13 22:35:06
The war on cash is real! The motive behind this is that they want everyone in the banking system. Criminal and disgusting, think of all the people in India with worthless paper who do not have access to banks. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 21:00:16
So, let me get this straight. China wants to implement a way to reward their citizens using a game that has real life consequences. I see a lot of bridges burning between friends and families once this becomes mandatory. Constant surveillance is what this "game" should be called. Goodbye Freedom. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 19:04:10
They can do it, don't underestimate the chinese government. I remember reading about them locking up people for short selling or just selling their stocks when the market was tanking. They will do whatever it takes to keep control of the currency and markets. If they continue to see BTC as a way for people to smuggle capital out of the country then they may eventually crack down on exchanges. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 05:10:38
Yeah lets put stickers and vandalize bank atms, some revolution.

"Be Fearful When Other Are Greedy, and Greedy When Others Are Fearful." -- Warren Buffett. Over used quote, you  obviously don't know what this means. A drop like this in bitcoin is normal.

Doesn't his facility use like a waterfall to save on electricity? 
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:51:05
I agree people will find a way which may be more dangerous. Governments cracking down tho may cause more harm and bad publicity for bitcoin than good is my guess. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 04:46:50
It will be hard for bitcoin to go 10 or even wow 100 times value if there are still such big hurdles regarding the future, such as scaling. There are a few great blockchain projects out there that are worth investing in besides bitcoin. I actually got down voted for mentioning that which shows just how blind and hostile the community has gotten towards other projects/ideas. As you said IF bitcoin succeeds and that is a big if, diversifying even a little does not hurt OP. I am a bitcoin believer, but having everything in it does not make much sense, especially now that it has grown to such a big market capitalization. Every 10x or 100x gain will be more difficult then the next. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:21:59
That explains the pump? maybe an exit strategy, careful. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 08:24:58
Yes, but telling people to buy because bitcoin goes down a little is not an excuse to use this quote. I'm just trying to help people understand that this drop is very typical action. Like you mentioned the Bitfinex hack was a great example of when to buy when there is blood and fear in the streets. I also agree with buying the dips if you are a long term investor. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 21:49:30
The same guy who wanted to do a 51% attack on ETC because it threatened his profits on mining ETH. Then switched to supporting ETC and look where that is now. This guy is a complete joke, he is in it for the attention and money. I want to be realistic with everyone here and say that this man child will jump ship the moment Bitcoin doesn't live up to the hype, and leave you holding the bag. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 22:57:34
lol :) 
@_date: 2016-11-13 22:01:54
Yes they can't control it but they can monitor it very well. If they can monitor every transaction and link it to a name can't they indirectly control what you spend your bitcoins on or where you transfer it. An example would be forcing exchanges to lock up coins that were transferred from another country. The only thing that worries fiat dominance according to Peter Thiel is when a coin can not be easily traced. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 22:48:32
really dude really.. lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:08:08
Bitcoin pump and dump. Brace yourselves. BCC going up! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:12:20
Sell it before it goes below 5k imo. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:09:44
I'm waiting for alts to take over. Sorry, BTC is a dead coin in the long run. Too much drama and gridlock. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:14:56
I actually am pro crypto. Bitcoin got the attention for crypto but it is time for alt coins with superior tech to take over. No offense but all this fork nonsense is why Bitcoin will fail. Goodluck hope you guys wake up. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:10:58
Are you trying to hide the pain behind a graph. Getting desperate here. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:19:31
what is this kid saying.. Gonna lose all his money.

Roger Ver is BCC supporter. Ofc he is going to abuse his power. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 05:25:31
When I first heard about Bitcoin it made complete sense, the ability to transport money anywhere in the world with no financial intermediary, finally technology has broken into the realm of money. As 2017 approaches, it is amazing to see how far Bitcoin has come but I would like to remind everyone that this is still a big experiment. I strongly believe the massive amount of investments built around Bitcoin right now has huge influence over its future regarding issues such as scaling. The future for Bitcoin remains cloudy...
@_date: 2016-10-23 01:11:52
This does not make sense as Bitcoin is 80%+ of the cryptocurrency market. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 05:21:34
China leading the Bitcoin bubble and controls all the mining. Goodluck with that. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 05:23:33
Or it could become 5,000 you never know, only invest what you are willing to lose.
