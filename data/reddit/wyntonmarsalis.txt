Unless you transferred the USD to your bank account, you are good. You can hold the money on Gdax and not be liable for any of the taxes. 
Just don't cash out.

As a new BTC hodler and generally old guy, I don't think the wallets are hard to comprehend. I downloaded electrum before I even bought 1 BTC in January and it was easy. 
There are confusing and off-putting details about BTC that make it intimidating, but wallets aren't one of them. 
I will say, hard forks, segwit, regulation are term that confuse and scare the most new people. I would like BTC to be like precious metals in that you just hold them and wait. All of these things make manipulation seem possible and spooky.

I am not asking why someone would sell $5 worth of BTC for $10, I am asking why someone would buy it.

Everyone else is seeing it...
Everyone except one guy...

The thread is about being confusing and intimidating. No one said you can't lose them, but that isn't the topic of conversation.

I always look in the toilet when I get up.

I think fear will make Btc tank around August 1st and after the dust settles, things will start looking up again.
