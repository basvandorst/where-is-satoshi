I believe they're referencing the opt-out "ip priority" feature in XT that has (and fetches) a list of known tor exitnodes and if it thinks it is being DDOS'ed drops those connections first.
There may be more aswell.

At that point you can simply stop the creation of any new  and switch to a different domain or service for new addresses.
If your real address got leaked you can get yourself a completely new email and change every existing account.
Hardly comparable effort.
It's about whether damage control is possible at all or not.
 are your even keeping track of addresses used in the past? Would be kinda helpful for the above scenario. Need some more sneakemail features please. :)

This sentence looks incomplete or odd.
I'd use either...


...or something like...

Yea.. no. 
Spammers and other people that you don't want to disclose your real address to can let a very simple regex run over their list to 'uncloak' your real address that way.
Just because the harvesters are currently tricked by it doesn't mean they won't be forever.

7zip just skims through the file until it starts seeing a header it understands. This is the most basic functionality of just about every forensic tool there is aswell.

The security difference here is not only about availability but about trust. 
The light clients essentially trust some remote server to maintain the blockchain for them and that could in theory be compromised or be on 'the wrong side' of a fork.

If I'm reading this right the previous versions did all the webapi interaction unencrypted? Including the authentication-less fetching of the (encrypted) wallet blob over the secret device-pairing-url. Someone please tell me I've overlooked something.

Thank you for the analysis. I agree the PIN protection is very well done.
However the comment you're replying to actually aims at a completely separate part of security than the local android vulnerability.
The commit I linked to shows them switching from HTTP to HTTPS for wallet fetching in the recent updates. Additionally the code for fetching the wallet (getWalletPayload() in MyRemoteWallet.java) appears to have nothing in it to prevent replaying the HTTP requests at a later point once they were sent over the (previously!) unencrypted wire.
I consider this issue fixed aswell now that they're using HTTPS, but that they were doing that in the first place does leave some bad aftertaste.
Thanks for taking care of these issues, zootreeves. Much appreciated.

No. All a hacker needs from you is the unencrypted private keys inside your wallet. If you keep your local client in-sync or not is completely irrelevant.

p2pool provides a good example here. The http frontend doesn't have to be public but the node can still take part in the actual decentralized network.
You'd still have a few market sites (nodes) providing public services for everyone, but if they're down, trades will still work on the private nodes.

This. From what has been said by slush it very much seems like they're reading his email... before it reaches his mailbox.
Goes along the lines of the recent linode incident where parts of the infrastructure were taken over, just that they had to hop a few more hoops to get the access instead of reading management passwords straight from the db.

Having only used sneakemail for years and not your service (yet)... They provide the ability to disable 'creation tokens'.
A bit of an explanation how snkmail works so the stuff below makes more sense:
snkmail works on a db of manually (or automatically) created addresses. One can either manually create a forwarder called 90393jfj thru their interface or (for the lazy) can simply autocreate such addresses by directly giving out stuff like ebay-mytoken1 automatically creating the forwarder (having previously assigned 'mytoken1' to yourself in their system once).
Now once spammer should figure out that scheme you can invalidate 'mytoken1' for the creation of *new* addresses keeping the existing forwarders intact (until you turn the leaked ones off individually).
Granted snkmail and your service do operate quite differently internally so I'm not implying that we need the exact same feature, but a way to essentially signal the system 'stop accepting *new addresses* on  and instead redirect stuff from  to me from now on. (Essentially the subdomain is the equivalent to the 'token' of snkmail.)

Sure you could argue trusting banks is insane aswell, especially nowadays.
But I'm fairly sure that more people put their saving into BoC than into Instawallet. :)

The pairing QR also must have had all the info needed to bypass 2FA for wallet retrieval.
So basically every operator of a public hotspot or ISP had all the necessary info in his proxy logs to directly retrieve the (encrypted) wallet. Without even actively bothering with MITM. No?
Would at least explain how some few people had their bc.info account emptied. Claiming their devices aren't infected.

Check the Javascript log of your browser to find which file doesn't verify, then look at it. The extension compares checksums against the [public github repo]( you could find a clean version of the file to diff against there.

What.. I...  don't even... [seriously](

...and fetch a local copy of [their offline recovery page]( for worst-case backup recovery.
...and install the [browser extension]( to verify their served JS.
EDIT: Whoops. Fixed a link to the wrong browser extension. But also a legit one from bc.info, no harm done.

... noone (sane) had their entire savings on it.

So there's some form of c/r authentication or time-based signing preventing replaying of the the GET's/POST's seen over unencrypted line to get to the blob?
