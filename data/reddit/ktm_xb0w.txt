yet great economists who question the value of bitcoin don't seem to comprehend it.
@_date: 2014-09-21 05:46:19
- first understand the technology (at least the basics)
- then if you believe in the mission, then invest, else not.
- but buying bitcoin purely from investing perspective might not suit your investment strategy.

when a boy in small town in kenya who is not privileged enough to have a credit card or paypal, wants to buy a medicine from, say cvs.com, he will go through all the things you mentioned to make that happen.


today over 6 billion people cannot order things from walmart.com. bitconi can change that. so you are saying walmart adding 6 billion people to its customer base is not a good thing?
please try to think in global content and everything will be more clearer.
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:58:58
and i appreciate a response otherwise there would be no discussion and ultimately no resolution. i just wanted to bring attention to the fact that may be we are getting too obsessed about explaining every detail about bitcoin than realizing that may we don't have to do all that. Apple doesn't explain how ApplePay works to general public, all it says it "IT WORKS" :)

@_date: 2014-01-11 15:44:46
like i mentioned, having opinion is not wrong, but trying to enforce that opinion upon their audience sounds unethical if not wrong, especially when that opinion is supported by very little knowledge on the topic. It is like saying, "I know nothing about internet, but to me it sound's very fishy?". 
All I am saying is if you don't know about anything then try to learn about it by asking question and being open minded and not already being highly opinionated.

@_date: 2014-10-06 03:53:28
that was brilliant..
@_date: 2014-09-16 02:12:00
i appreciate your comment, but just because they accept it, doesn't mean 100% of their user base will start using it (which might take months/years). besides, my point wasn't about walmart but about us, as to how we, as community, should try to tailor news related to bitcoin in a way that would ultimately change peoples' perception on bitcoin. so their questions will change from "why should i use bitcoin" to "why am i not using bitcoin?".
@_date: 2014-09-16 02:14:35

i am not asking wikipedia to lose its core value. but i also don't understand how just by having ads (or any other revenue model) would completely lose its integrity..there should be some better way than just depending on user generosity cause that doesn't sound like a viable solution. all i am saying is may be if they were also able to make same amount of revenue as that of google's (since they can) they be me able to make greater difference in the world like google. let me know if i am missing something.
@_date: 2014-11-08 22:31:13

i know, and that was response to another reddit post. so you are still making a decision based on a reddit post. i don't mean to pressure, but i was just trying to understand as to why someone would invest in one or the other, if they had an option to invest. :)
@_date: 2014-11-28 12:28:11
yes, supporting both is better as they both serve different needs. but why would you donate to a non non-profit company?

Charlie, please don't feel obliged to response to those who don't or can't see beyond their personal need.

@_date: 2014-09-20 18:23:59
yes, it is not perfect pitch but i think my definition might bring more users to bitcoin than saying "it's the internet of money". How many people today can even comprehend the notion "internet of money"? If anything, that will just scare people off.
All I am trying to say is we should define bitcoin is simplest form when we are explaining it to general public, something that they can relate too, but i could be wrong.
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:18:04
if you are only hoarding bitcoin and using credit card for transactions than how are you benefiting from all the benefits that bitcoin provides over credit card? just curious.

Peter, you are one of the smartest people on silicon valley. However, I think you need to revisit your sources when it comes to Bitcoin. I think a quick chat with Andreessen Horowitz should clear your thoughts on Bitcoin.

because there are tons of medicine that you can find in cvs that you can't get in entire countries like kenya or other under developed countries. and i know this from personal experience.


i am sorry but you seem to be under informed because only handful of countries have same products like US. ALL other are way out of reach of US products.


again because they don't find the product in their native home country and even if they did they would pay for shipping because of the quality of the product and trust in US companies, especially when buying health care products (eg. medicine, baby care products)
 &gt;But I can't see why I would buy bitcoin to pay for something right now.
you are lucky and happy for you. but for many more there is no way other way to buy things from across the globe without using bitcoin. i know this is not currently possible cause not many companies ship globally but once all big companies accept bticoin and slowly start shipping to every corner of the globe, then the power of bitcoin will be more evident.

Yes, bitcoin is currency and not payment processor and i wan't trying to make point on what bitcoin is and how it compares to paypal or ApplePay, I was pointing on what might be better way to MARKET bitcoin. I was talking about marketing strategy and everyone seem to think i was comparing bitcoin with paypal or AppleyPay. May be my post wan't clear enough. my bad, if it gave wrong perception.
@_date: 2014-09-21 13:10:24
thank you for logical comment. but email didn't need marketing because it didn't have monetary value associated with it. there was nothing to lose in trying it. with bitcoin there is. and i wan't trying to find a perfect marketing pitch but rather a simple answer to a question from a 15 yr old boy "What is bitcoin?"

@_date: 2014-01-25 18:02:55
every emerging technology or company goes through stability issues until it reaches critical mass. that is how it is supposed to work. so this is nothing out of the norm. if bitcoin was already stable at this early stage than it would not be a big innovation that it is. so ask your contact to come up with better excuse. :)

my point exactly. thks for clarifying :-)
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:15:24
I know bitcoin is no way like paypal..but try explaining that to general people. If we want general public to use bitcoin then we use market it like wise. How many people in the world do you think understands the word "decentralization"? If you want to make them use bitcoin, then you need to used the terms that they are already familiar with and in this content all i could think of was paypal. If you have better marketing pitch, please do share. thks

bitcoin is all about Normative philosophy. that is how it all started and that is its core purpose. and bitcoin is not just proposed method of payment. that is like saying internet is just faster way to fax.

my pitch is not for early adopter. early adopters don't need explanation. they are capable to researching that on their own. It was intended more for those who are not lucky enough or educated enough to be part of the elite group. And not just US audience but global audience who don't have luxury to go through the details of bitcoin and all they care about is getting paid instantly from, say, US customer for the service they provided from China, India, or Kenya. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:24:58
yup, they are perfect for this and am pretty much sure they are working on it, if not, they should. we need debit/credit cards so we can use it for ALL of our expenses. right now even bitcoiners like us (forget about mainstream) are not able to buy grocery, gas etc using bitcoin. this needs to change.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:16:31
this is great news because i believe, right now, small technology startups accepting bitcoin is more important than big companies. it gives bitcoin its steady growth and less volatility.
@_date: 2014-10-09 20:34:55
could you please explain why?
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:33:47

@_date: 2015-01-16 21:21:56


don't think so, if you use it in small scale.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:33:53
because price is a relative term. for those who bought 1BTC at $0.01 couple years back, for them $200 is already like $500k for us now. Think about what your answer would have been if someone in 2009 asked similar question that "why would anyone buy 1BTC at $200?"
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:00:48
i guess you are write to some extent but at this stage if someone has gone through the hassle of setting up a wallet and own some bitcoin, then I would consider them as user because now they atleast know something about bitcoin and how to own some. And even after counting them as user, the total number of user is still very low.
@_date: 2015-01-10 13:47:09

@_date: 2015-01-15 22:24:36
next time you use your credit card on a restaurent, they can store your number and charge on it anytime, and if you miss this transaction on your credit card statement, you will never request refund. with bitcoin no one can charge you anything until you send it. no one can take or charge on your account. this is just one simple use case, to answer your credit card questions.

yes, it is and also BECAUSE it is finance, shouldn't people be even more anxious to learn and adopt to save their financial belongings. I hear you but I am just trying to understand peoples' psychology, since i have myself found harder to convince my close ones to learn about Bitcoin.

why is buying BTC a greed? don't we all do the same on much smaller scale.

if you read carefully, my post suggests donating to charity than to celebrity themselves, like in this case of Jimmy Fallon. you can donate for both reasons, out of good heart and for exposures. in both case charity wins.

i agree, i was just trying to make a point that investing in bitcoin related company is indirectly investing in bitcoin cause these companies wouldn't exist, if bitcoin didn't. so risk is still there. but i agree on your point. thks
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:52:08
the right time to buy is when you understand what bitcoin is and its purpose. once you understand that, timing will be irrelevant.

i used to donate to them but later stopped because i think they need to change their business plan. their website has users equivalent to that of google's. that means if they wanted they could be as much influential as google and contribute more to the world. but, yet they choose to request donation and stay non-innovative.
if someone asks, which one i would prefer, company with no ads like wikipedia or company with ads like google, i would say i choose company with ads like google. because google has contributed more to the world than wikipedia.

that is for the user to decide, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-09-02 23:42:52
that would be even great :)
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:05:35
i see where you are coming from and somewhat agree with you..but i wasn't trying to assert that bitcoin is not virtual. it may be both and more, i was only requesting to use the term 'digital' than 'virtual' since people were think of bitcoin as amazon coins when it was referred as 'virtual' currency :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:42:37
exactly and anyone going to the media seem to have their own rendition when it comes to definition and details. this is creating nothing buy confusion which bitcoin is already struggling with from the beginning. i am just demanding consistency. :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:31:25
the objective of the post is not to argue on technicality but to define how we present bitcoin to the mainstream media in a simplest way possible and removing any confusion the public might have.
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:01:44
i am a fan of overstock but i never shop there!
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:45:34
i agree with you..anything as long as that is consistent. the reason i used 'DIGITAL' is because that is what is used in  and all videos explaining bitcoin..
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:39:10
i agree. so what would be your suggestion as to how we distinguish bitcoin with coins offered by amazon or games, so people don't think bitcoin is the same. i saw one guy posting on twitter "doesn't amazon already have this?" how do you suggest we respond to that?
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:33:08
using the terms '(decentralized) digital payment system', 'open source protocol' would not be that appealing to a 80 yr old or a 10 yr old non-tech people now would it?
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:15:47
thsk..great link..i have been watching a lot of his videos..great stuff..i hope he pushes the community to come up with the distinction soon, so people don't think of coin when they are talking about protocol or vice versa..cheers..
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:03:57
that was funny :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:35:36
i wasn't going for specific details, but to come up with a way to present bitcoin in media in a consistent way so a consumer would not get confused with all the technical terms that are being thrown around bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:10:47
sorry 'dollar' is too localized and bitcoin is international.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:24:53
like i mentioned it is ok as long as we maintain consistency. 'Cryptographic Currency' sound's perfect..now if i only knew what 'Cryptographic' meant :) ..hehe..
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:52:59
there is nothing wrong with saying "not real" except that it would not be a great marketing pitch. try saying to someone,'give me $700 and i will give you 1 bitcoin 'not real' currency". now that doesn't sound appealing, does it?
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:44:11
i have added all the bitcoin related new sources to a list in tweetdeck. it has been working great so far.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:56:51
hope not, cause if we think marketing is not important than it will take longer for people to understand and adopt. it is more than just marketing, it is educating with a marketing touch.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:27:45
 bitcoin is 'payment protocol' like 'internet protocol'. besides, saying that bitcoin is 'digital currency' (not 'new' currency) should not hurt. we have to be very careful with choice of words, i think. thks for comment.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:49:10
exactly, and therefore i think we also need to distinguish between Bitcoin protocol and bitcoin currency. may be we should say BMTP (Bitcoin Money Transfer Protocol) for protocol and just 'bitcoin' for currency. bitcoin foundation should resolve this as they themselves seem to have hard time explaining this to media. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:16:13
appreciate your elaborate response.


yes it was.


my only objective of this post was to ensure people don't take bitcoin as amazon coin, which i saw on a twitter post, which started all this.


totall agree.


this i am not sure of, cause i know a lot of people are saying it is not currency because of its volatility. i am no economist but i would like to know if on the definition of 'currency' is there a condition where it says "to be a currency, one cannot be volatile". if there is then, i agree bitcoin is not currency at the moment but if there is not that condition then, despite the volatility, bitcoin is a currency. i don't think it is volatility that makes something a currency or not. plz correct me if i am wrong.


bitcoin protocol is payment system and bitcoin currency is a digital currency. again this brings to my another request to bring separate terminology for bitcoin protocol and bitcoin currency to avoid confusion.
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:02:59
no offense taken :) but people who think bitcoin is virtual currency like amazon coin, cares. now the question is, do we care enough about bitcoin to address that?
