It's not weakness. In a marriage you tend to do what's best for the family, not just yourself. And you come to a consensus on decisions, not just one person getting their way.
If you want to be totally selfish then you shouldn't be in a marriage.

Take money out of your family's mouth? Why is there money in there?

It depends if you move the coins to someone paying you moneys

You’re acting like people invest in bitcoin up to the amount they consider to be a large amount of money. Why should that be necessarily true, given the riskiness? I may have thousands in savings and still invest less than 100$ in bitcoin just because it’s an experiment or because it’s the maximum amount I’m willing to throw away. The article even compares bitcoin to a casino, because people think it’s fun to gamble. It’s like making fun of a person for walking into a casino and losing $100 on slots. Why would anyone spend such a small amount at a casino? Should I plan on at least spending a few thousand on slots?

Has the value of goods and services you can buy with bitcoin increased, or just the dollar value? I'm genuinely curious if there's anything besides dollars you can buy 10,000 of now that you could only buy one of when 1 bitcoin was trading at $1.
By the way it's intentional that our dollar is inflationary. The fed doesn't want deflation because it's seen as bad for the economy, partly because with deflation nobody wants to spend their money. Economies thrive on the free flow of currency, not the freezing of it.

So bitcoin is oxygen? You need to to live?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:09:13
So you can celebrate the value that you can get by selling bitcoin, but criticize people who sold their bitcoins?

You don’t have money until you sell it for dollars.

You’re not making a killing until you sell for dollars. You and everyone else just want to hold it until you decide to cash out and convert to dollars and buy something useful. The current price isn’t driven by its value as an exchange currency it’s driven by speculation. What happens when everyone starts to cash out at once because they think the price peaked.
When you can pay for a kid’s college tuition in bitcoin I’ll be interested. When you can buy and house or a car I’ll be interested.

Millionaires in dollars. You’re only doing well with bitcoin when you sell it. That’s not a good sign for a currency. Sounds more like a pyramid scheme.

How is a skyrocketing dollar value contributing to that goal?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:54:43
Great! A currency that nobody wants to get rid of, unless it's for dollars. That's not how a currency is supposed to work. Buying a good or service with bitcoin would be financially irresponsible at this point.
How is hyper deflation a good thing? Shouldn't you want the exchange rate to stabilize?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:11:09
Serious question, what can I buy 10,000 of now that I could only buy 1 of when bitcoin was trading at $1?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:31:49
That is interesting. But I see that Newegg immediately sells the bitcoins they accept for dollars, so in effect you are letting them convert it to dollars for you and probably paying them a premium in the process.

You shouldn’t invest in any currency. Only buy bitcoin if you want to trade it for goods and services, unfortunately this bubble virtually ensures people won’t use it for that because they’re better off trading for dollars.
