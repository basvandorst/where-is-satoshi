I think that coinbase is more concerning to me.  I don't want to use a service that is so beholden to the banking system that it will freeze my account if any agency asks it to and which has the power to do so.  
Don't use BTCE if you are afraid that the state will take it down, but if you can't say that you are 100% up and up (and with banks and bitcoin that may not even matter) then a service like coinbase is a bigger threat to you.
 At least I know if any one of hundreds of states and thousands of agencies and banks within send a letter to BTCE asking them to freeze accounts of x person, they wont be able to comply because they don't have the persons info.  With coinbase, it is only a matter of time before someone loses all of their bitcoin because of AML/KYC.

Ok guys we need to start a petition to rename **drug market ultra**.  I conducted an academic sampling of my grandmother, and her cat.  110% of the respondents preferred ***Milton Friedman's erect penis***, and were spurred to great philosophical discussions, but hid under the table when they heard  **drug market ultra**.

Unless you're a subjectivist ethics aren't personal taste.  Most ethicists would profoundly disagree with your comment.   
Though, I do think that one needs to present evidence of claims about unethical behaviour, and demonstrate those claims.

Well, what I was trying to say is that disagreement doesn't matter in the realm of ethics according to most ethicists.  There may be questions and dilemas that are unanswered, much like in mathematics, but outside of subjectivists (who are largely not considered in philisophical ethics), ethics is considered to be an objective study.
However, as I said, one should provide a proper argument which can be properly addressed.  Be that for the promoter or refuter of a position.

Their support helped me through a pretty arduous problem when my email was lost due to lavabit going away.  They gave me step by step instructions to verify who I was.  They weren't super responsive and I had to open a second ticket but I didn't have to use the trollbox or shout loudly about them being shady on bitcointalk, just used their ticket system and everything worked out.  
It would be nice if they had better support, but coinbase doesn't have great support either, and what about campbx?  Actually who does have good support?
