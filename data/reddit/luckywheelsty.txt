I see. Thanks for helping me understand!

Right - I guess the hardware isn't up to speed to achieve something like that. Maybe in a few years!
Thanks for answering.

Looks like it may have had some effect!

THANKS!!! This worked for me. Last thing I am trying to figure out is how to open port 8333 on my dumb Ubee router/modem. Forwarded port to my node IP address but still shows that port as closed.

Post this either in or I'd be curious to hear people's thoughts! It'll get buried here.

Seems like there's some change
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:37:59
Who knows. I'm not complaining!

Totally! Just want to contribute to the decentralized network. And it's just fun to learn new skills!

From my understanding of the tutorial I followed the node's IP is static. Still trying to figure out how to enable pruning. Getting there slowly but surely!

Cool! I figured this had to exist somewhere. Thanks!

Haha. I did. I'm just a n00b

New to crypto, glad all my shit's on a ledger or I may have caved. That was fun as hell to watch on GDAX

I ordered mine from Amazon Prime, and it was sold and fulfilled by them - took 2 days to arrive. However when I went to order one as a Christmas gift they are only being offered by 3rd party retailers now it seems.

What school? Are they actually teaching classes on this?
