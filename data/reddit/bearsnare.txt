Thats good. Sort of. So you know you wrote down the public address correctly, just the password was either entered or written down incorrectly. Is there any part of your password that could possibly have spaces in it ( or lack of spaces? ). While a space at the beginning and end of a passphrase is removed, spaces in the middle are not.
For example, your password may be "i like to jump over fences" and you may have typed it in as "i like to jump **overfences**".

For me it took under an hour for them to make both deposits (2 weeks ago). If you use Wells Fargo you can use your online ID to verify, which is much quicker.

~~if you go here  and enter your passphrase you should be able to get the public and private key of your wallet and then you use be able to use the info at  to import your private key into a wallet on blockchain.info, where you can send those bitcoins to some other wallet~~
Actually, it looks like you can enter the same password on the bitaddress.org site under the brain wallet tab and it will give you the private address.

This. I think that over time, if the price of bitcoin rises, we will see many of these coins sold and distributed.

Have you gone to blockchain.info and checked that your bitcoins are in the address you think they are?

It works for me to scan it.

It isn't hedging if all the prices rise and fall together.

In my opinion, diversification works when you buy into other sectors that either do not depend, or are inversely dependent on the price of whatever you are holding. In this case all of the altcoins seem to move pretty much parallel to bitcoin, so diversification probably won't reduce your risk much.

I also tried resetting my password, but am not being logged in.
