Thank you. You said it very nicely.  Many elderly people were also very grateful to Ross and to Silk Road. We felt empowered as if we were finally being treated with appropriate respect. No one has the right to tell us not to make use of what God created for us. Even if they think they do, I do not recognize it.
The criminalization of drug use is an abomination that benefits exactly no one save big-time criminals and law-enforcement. It is perhaps the most corrupt association on the planet brining together hoards of gooks and large-scale criminal gangs in a common cause to amass unimaginable amounts of money at the expense of immeasurable human suffering. It is monstrously evil what's being done to Ross. I'm so sorry.

Wow. This says a lot about the times we're living in. Massive numbers of people without reasonable access to medicine having to do what they can to survive. It's truly shameful that the US has degenerated to this level. For those of us who are older, it's really very shocking. The US people inhabit today bears little resemblance to the one I grew up in. It's fucking scary.

In truth they care about neither. It's about money.

You are 100% right to stand up for what you *know*. It's the right thing to do. I believe every word his sister says in this video is absolutely true. I also believe Ross has a lot to do with founding and running Silk Road and that it was a very beneficial service to many of us who have trouble getting about due to age or infirmity. I loved the Silk Road.

Well, you shouldn't. I'll explain later.
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:25:46
Those charges have been dropped. See comment above in thread.

I believe everything she says. I believe Silk Road, with all it's problems, really was, for the most part, very idealistic and beneficial to many people. People could finally get weed and other drugs without the risk of buying them on the streets from scary people. The vast majority of drug users do not enjoy the criminal aspect of their lifestyle at all. They hate it. They are not criminals in any other way. Most aren't even counter-culture or liberal.
I have never believed that Ross Ulbricht is evil, corrupt, vicious or cynical - certainly not in comparison with the people who set him up. He does not seem like the kind who would deliberately harm anyone. It's obvious from his writing and videos. He is exactly what he looks like; a genuinely nice, intelligent and sensitive guy. Not an underworld guy. Not a mafioso. Not a part of the traditional mafia-law enforcement criminal association. A complete outsider. That probably explains his being taken down the way he was. The DEA, FBI, and their underworld counterparts and partners needed to reassert the fact that no form of competition will be tolerated.
Many of us think Ross was set up and that the most egregious charges against him are completely false. We do not believe he would "order a hit" on anyone. The traditional criminals, including the DEA, FBI, and their underworld counterparts in the mafia needed to reassert the fact that no form of competition would be tolerated. Stooping to tactics that would've seemed unimaginable to a naive young idealist like Ross, law- enforcement set him up and knocked him down without mercy.
The problem is the money. Those who are profiting enormously from the criminalization of drug use aren't going to stop at anything to remove perceived threats to their power. They will coerce, lie, bribe, corrupt, kill, intimidate, threaten, deceive and confound without remorse. That's what they're trained to do. They act as if they are entirely above the law. What can anyone do about it? What can be done to help aside from donating $ to pay for more lawyers?

Because it's the stupid side.
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:20:56
I do not want Ross in jail at all. I never believed the chargers of murder. It's hard to understand how some do. Propaganda?
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:34:43
Those charges have been dropped. Read above.
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:15:36
The charges of murder for hire have been dropped.

The charger for murder for hire have been dropped.

Thyroid hormone. Well shit.

It put Goldman Sachs and Bank of America to shame. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:12:57
There are NO murder for hire charges. Not a single corpse has turned up. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:10:19
I'm so happy to hear those fake murder for hire charges were dropped. I never believed them for an instant. The fact that they were dropped makes it even more obvious. If they weren't fake they would be taken more seriously. People would be dead.
There isn't a single corpse. They had to drop those fake chargers. They probably planned to all along. Used them to scare the fuck out of people and manipulate them. An old LE trick. They're good at what they do and willl stoop to anything to get what they want. Anything.
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:05:30
That's not what I saw.

Those who uphold laws that are wrong because they are laws are part of the problem we're having on this planet.
Given a choice between the appropriate way and the traditional way, they always pick the traditional way. Since it is inappropriate things get worse and people suffer. And nothing gets better. So, thanks for that.
