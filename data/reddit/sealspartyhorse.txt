Did you cashout from Betcoin to your Coinbase address?  I've heard from a few people that they were blocked directly after having their cashout processed.

If you're a developer, entrepreneur, or evangelist then you really should not be getting bummed out by the price.  To anyone that can build, please don't also be addicted to watching trade orders.  How can you ponder new innovation, write code, or build a business if you can't take a dump without bringing your phone with you to watch the price?
Addiction is not a PARTY.
