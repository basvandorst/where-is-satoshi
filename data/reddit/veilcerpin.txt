I was holding on to 12 coins. WAS :(
Right before the Silk road Closure I had 12 Bitcoins stolen from my Bitcoin Core wallet. I awoke one morning to see my wallet had 4 out going transactions to the same address. I literally cried a little bit. I was so angry that I basically took a year off of bitcoin.
I would have sold my 12 at 1100 bux and then bought back in at the 200 mark.. I still have an upset stomach anytime I think of all the money I lost. 
TLDR: Do not leave RDP port open on the device you use to host your wallet :( :( :(

I have 4 charts open on my 4 monitors at work.. during the 1000$ threshold, no PC's got fixed at my job. 
So glad I moved cash to LTC, my BTC profits are just great.

You can still hold all of those morals and remain flexible and still be rigid at home in your own house. Grow and pair and your girl will love you more, I guarantee it. Woman do not want the guy that is understanding and listens to them, those are the guys that get shat on, taken advantage of... They want/need someone to take charge and make decisions, any girl that thinks otherwise has been ruined by future population reduction propaganda.
I understand that here in the future guys are very very feminine, and have a hard time proclaiming dominance. There are many ways to be a man, asking for permission to spend your own money is not one of them.

Maybe get her approval before spending the money. Was the 10k yours or both of yours?
Or you are from alabama?

Well I respect your view as well, and i'll take your advice with a grain of salt, but please do not discard my views from your memory as well. 
This is a weird topic for /r bitcoin in any regard. OP if you are still around.. Give your wife a hug and a kiss... tell her you love her... it will be all better.

See if your mom will buy you some coin dust for your birthday or xmas or something... You dont have to get alot. Just enough to put on the market and make a trade. Walk your mom through the whole process and keep her updated on your profit/loss... if it so happens you are a trading wiz then your mom will be happy to invest some more of her money. 
IMO you should wait this bubble out before you buy in.

I shall answer a question with a question. Why on earth would you browse the internet on the computer that holds your btc. Your wallet should be on a machine that has all ports blocked except your wallet port and maybe rdp... Never use that machine to wonder aimlessly on the internet. Buy a refurb dell workstation on ebay for 15 bux, make it headless, and host your wallet on that.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:21:37
Keep it and mine alt coins. Be a big ol bear on all fronts. :D

I'm still working on getting my 60 year old father into Bitcoin.. He just retired and has access to his 401k... He's smart, he just thinks the same as your mother.. Scam... I'm on the fence about the whole scam thing. There is still some chance that bitcoin could end belly up zeros... then again it could be the new defacto world currency. We cannot know until it happens.. .
but if you educate yourself about the markets and trends of the market then you can make a quick profit.. if not you are doomed to lose... there are way seasoned trading vets here from bitcoin and from more traditional trading scenes. New commers are like chum to sharks for these guys. Just be careful and do not put in more than you want to lose... old saying in btc world but it rings true time and time again.

rofl.. hopefully im still in cash and just call the bank :D
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:13:47
You need to open a bank account and sell those bad boys if you want the cash. Get your bank account verified at GOX or Coinboase if you are in America, use an exchange that is in your country to avoid large international wire transfer fees.
Once you have the verified account send those coins to that market and sell what you want to sell. You can then transfer the cash straight to your bank account and pay whatever bills, eat, etc... Hang on to some of those bitcoins though too, b/c this 1100$ mark will soon be left in the dust by a higher digit.

I totally agree with you. This is serious real world business now and should be treated as such, if we are ever to be taken seriously.. MSPAINT wizards makes us look childish.

We do not need George Orwell involved with bitcoins. No Thank you.

See, I just dont know whats going to happen. The buy support and market cap suggests another surge. Though, none of my charts I have open can predict Noob panic buy/sells lol... so i'll sit out on that wager :P

Well then she has no room to talk if you are bringing home the bacon.. technically its "our" money... but as men we know in reality... its "your" money.. do as you please. If she's the one she will love you whether you lost it all or hit it big... this would be a good test for your relationship haha

I want as many whole btc I can get my hands on before your above statement is false. If/when your average family member is hip to bitcoin, we may very well be in acceptance phase and that 1$ million bitcoin may be there waiting for us.
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:50:04
I have no reasons or links to back this statement up, but my gut tells me xmas day will be the real correction back to 130$ range.

Sorry if I hit the significant other button... But I'm sorry, you gotta wear some pants in relationship.. tell her what you are doing before you do it that way she is at least hip to whats going down. When I make a decision, i tell my sig other and then proceed with the plan. Sorry, I like to be a man.

Its the same 700 that watch my little pony.

If you made one transaction from us bank to an exchange.. you left a paper trail.. very taxable.

1252$ will be the bubble pop, the psychological barrier of matching the price of gold may be too much for the market to bare. Or, on the other hand it could instill more faith and shoot us to 1500$ The hour long MA's for btc are so close to cross showing a downtrend... that price of gold is a decent milestone to be looking for when thinking about a pop.
Notice Gox's high is 1242.. 10 below my prediction...it already seems like that psychological barrier of gold price has some merit.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:45:42
iiii dunno, btc is already divisible out for a long way. Id rather have 2 coins in my wallet than have to worry about 2 million coins... too many units to worry about. Keep it simple.
plus i love the idea that someday .003 will buy you an amazing dinner.

I'm just trying to grow my btc fund... I would love to see a nice dive :P
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:13:42
LTC and BTC trade jumps make me alot of money, just watch the charts... I agree that LTC and the other alt are mostly speculation... well that speculation is garnering returns.. i'm in it while the getting is good. Be smart and trade smart... I will eventually end in all bitcoins.
