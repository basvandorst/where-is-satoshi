I think it's like 1 btc gets frozen from bitcoin blockchain and can be made into 10000 gonzcoins. These gonzcoins don't need to be mined and can essentially just be distributed knowing that always the value of a gonzcoin is equal to 1/10000 of a btc.

Which countries do you think are the next likely candidates? I've been reading that a lot of money is leaving the emerging economies as the Fed has started to wind back QE. 
You say not to worry about price, but I think that price is important in regards to your scenario. If you want some bitcoin philanthropist to donate a chunk of their coins to save an emerging economy, you need the market capitalisation of the currency to be such that their donation can have an impact.
Perhaps you could create and distribute a domestic crypto to exchange for their inflating currency, that is linked by a side chain to bitcoin so that it acts as a reserve for their currency. I think I'm just rambling now...

I wasn't able to switch servers as I wasn't even able to get into the application. I managed to find an old dmg of an earlier version that at least opened up the app but even then there was no option in the preferences to switch servers and the network button did not open up anything.

But bitcoins are infinitely divisible. So even if 12 of the 12.5 million were being hoarded, so long as they weren't dumped onto the market, an entire economy could operate on that 500 000 bitcoins. Each one would just have to be worth more in order to transfer value.

Energy will always flow from a hotter environment to a colder environment. If the composition of the Earth's atmosphere inhibits the achievement of this equalisation, then intrinsic solutions to the closed thermodynamic system arise that will, by performing metabolic work in the system, cause a change in the atmosphere, which in turn reduces the retentive capacity of the system.

I don't really think your tipping analogy works because there are other people's livelihoods dependent upon tips. Since drug use is more of a personal issue I'd say it's more akin to practising homosexuality whilst it was still considered illegal.

You come across a dynastic family of money.
I think the reason why it always comes back to Jews is that they have rather closed off religious stipulations with regards to marriage and they've been able to preserve a strong Jewish cultural identity. As they were traditionally the bankers of Europe, they've been able to consolidate a lot of wealth into these dynasties that now control a lot of the wealth in America. It's nothing intrinsically bad about the Jews, just nepotism.

I know there's exceptions to every rule but you can't deny that minorities are overrepresented in the lower classes and that's because of racism and systemic oppression. 
It's wrong to use skin colour as the basis of judging someone but when you're a poor black guy, you'd get pretty sick of rich white guys making decisions which continually keep fucking you over. 
Perhaps I am out of touch, but it seems to me as if the beneficiaries of the current economic system are disproportionately rich white people and to me it's understandable that that is why there's the resentment.

I'm not sure I agree with your assessment that very few people would see him. 
He's been on the front cover of several surfing magazines several times. I haven't bothered to research total readership, but one of those publications alone has a readership of 160 000 people just in little old Australia. Considering the fact he is regarded by many in the surfing community as one of the best big wave surfers around, and his dropping from Billabong has been a topic of debate amongst the surfing community, the news of his sponsorship would surely generate a bit of discussion and perhaps even an article or two on it. That article could be read by hundreds of thousands of people perhaps even millions and as I said originally, I think many people from the international travel/surfing community could benefit from using bitcoin for their travels.

Perhaps there is a kind of middle ground, where through the drive towards zero marginal cost, massive corporations (google) begin to provide us with free services (driverless cars) and utilities (internet, electricity) in exchange for data on our habits. I don't think we can really expect governments to do it. Government is too wasteful in administration. The more you can strip back the political apparatus the more money you have provide services like a UBI, healthcare and education.  It's either going to be anarchist communities or private corporations in exchange for valuable information. I know which one I prefer.

Email is a good comparison in many ways, but when it comes down to it, the two are quite different and as such you can expect people's behaviour to vary according to their risk tolerance for what's being stored. Not many people have information sensitive enough to warrant being that cautious. Many people however want to have control of their own finances and want to know that when it comes down to it, that they cannot be seized.

I think it will actually turn out awesome for them. The price showed pretty solid support at ~800 for 2 months and showed good resistance throughout this turmoil at $500. To be able to get people to sign up to their pegged accounts with bitcoin at $550-650, they stand to benefit when the price rises back to $800 and beyond. If they'd opened earlier when bitcoin was at $800 and had to top up everyone's accounts throughout this dip, it would have made things much more difficult for them.

If you are struggling to get connections [here]( is a list of fallback nodes which can increase your connections.

I received a tracking number quickly but there was some sort of a mix up and I could see my package was getting bounced around a bit in the States. After contacting Amagi to find out what had happened, I was quickly contacted by a staff member who informed me there had been an error when filling out the customs form so my parcel was returned to sender. The sender details were of the company office in NY rather than their shipping centre in CO, so it took another few days for it to be dispatched again. According to the new tracking number I was given my coins are now in FedEx's mail centre in Sydney and should be arriving quite soon. Overall the experience was easy with good support from Amagi staff when contacted. I was a bit disappointed with the fee to pay in bitcoin, but that was more than compensated for by the fact I bought my gold when bitcoins were at $240.

Nice. It seems like there's a lot of likeminded people in the Bitcoin community. Similar to the ideas of I have an ambitious fantasy of getting a community of Bitcoin entrepreneurs together and relocating to a developing country and starting a sustainable city from scratch. Take somewhere really hostile that no one wants and see how far you can get by employing techniques of permaculture, open source ecology, renewable energy, seed factories and a new, completely transparent form of governance.

Bitcoin is a currency. What don't you understand about it?
The key differences between it and traditional currencies are that it does not have any central authority to dictate the monetary supply (but rather a known production rate), it can be sent directly from P2P without having to be processed by a third party, and the location/owner of every coin is known by the record in the public ledger. The public ledger is kept safe by people who task their computers to encrypting it and for this they are probabilistically rewarded new units of the currency, proportional to the effort they contributed.
The value of a coin is tethered to the real world by the cost of the electricity and hardware required to generate the new coins and by the savings that can be experienced in a market by accepting bitcoin's competitive advantage as a transaction protocol.
This would only leave us with a relatively low value for bitcoin but at least it's a value. The rest of the value comes as people anticipate that it will supersede traditional payment methods in a number of multi billion dollar markets. If bitcoin is to service a market of $21 billion dollars, then when all bitcoins are mined (21 million), each unit will have to be worth $1000 in order to service that economy. 
Because of how useful and how much more economical bitcoin is, the expectation is bitcoin will service markets worth much much more than $21 billion hence people are seeing $300 coins as cheap if in a decade or so they are to be worth upwards of $10 000 a coin.

it does, but there comes a point when your currency has appreciated so much that you start to spend it. I purchased a fair few coins a couple of years ago but only spent 20% of them at the time as I wanted to keep the rest as a long term investment. after the recent run up and stabilisation i've spent about 20% of mine again with plans to keep the rest as a long term investment. the best thing about the deflationary nature of bitcoin imo is that it forces the consumer to choose when they want to consume carefully rather than encouraging consuming via inflation just for the sake of it. the planet really doesn't need more rampant consumerism.

People keep asking me when I will cash out as well. They still can't get their head around it when I tell them never. This is future money and I already have some. I'm planning on using my millions to get involved in projects like open source ecology and start ups too.
@_date: 2013-05-01 08:57:21
If they look to integrate it into their services how exactly will this work? I'm imagining something similar to the idea floated in this sub when WU announced they were looking into it: being able to fund exchanges directly with paypal and cashing out via them. This might be a bit more difficult though as Paypal doesn't really have the same means of distributing physical currency to you as WU does.
Would Paypal's payment network be cheaper to process transactions upon than bitcoin's?

Stole it from indigenous folks all over the world. 
In Australia the indigenous culture had persisted successfully for over 70 000 years. They didn't believe that an individual could possess land, but more so that the land possessed individuals. For Hobbes to come over with his Western philosophical construct of 'might makes right' and assume that suggests a level playing field, fails to take into account the *a priori* fact that a culture may not necessarily view property in the same respect as he did.

discobean has no obligation to spend any bitcoins that he has purchased as an investment. other users should be happy that there are speculators hoarding, as that increases the price of bitcoins relative to fiat currency, which in turn means they have to spend less of theirs for purchases.

I have 290. I got left some inheritance so I figured why not play a high risk long game and chucked in about $4k at around $15/btc. They then dropped to $2.40 and I'm kicking myself that I lost the confidence to buy more. If they're a success I'm going to spend them on a virgin galactic flight and a farm.

No, I meant when the price of 1 bitcoin was at $230 and moving $25-30 dollars a day. I figured something had to give.  The gold was around $1600/oz or so and promptly dropped to $14xx after I bought it, haha. I had to pay a small fee for paying with bitcoin but with the profits I'd made in bitcoin that didn't really matter. It cost me around thirty something coins, so now that they've stabilised at around 100 I like to think I bought 5oz of gold for $3k

I bought 5 x 1oz American Buffalos with Amagi back when the price was $230. It took a little while to come but that was due to a mix up on the customs form and it having to be sent to Australia. Otherwise, perfect transaction. Would buy again.

You should still be able to withdraw your bitcoins to a wallet without verification. I think I had to verify my identity after the hack in 2011 if you've been dormant that long.

I don't understand this part;


Whose only recourse- the individual who says I own this land or the collective whose land now 'belongs' to the individual? Can't the collective simply not acknowledge his claim and continue using the land as they did or does that constitute violence under Hobbes?
Btw, if you'll notice, I never said it was some peaceful communist paradise. I simplified it because we're in a thread on and I didn't feel the need to provide their entire cultural history to mention them in a discussion. For you to assume I'm ignorant of it and to take offense at it suggests you perhaps need to stop being such a pussy.

I'm not entirely sure but I believe the difficulty is set in response to the average hashing of the network as the previous x amount of blocks were solved. If all miners stop, the next difficulty adjustment will respond and you'll be able to mine coins off your cpu again.

Disagree. It's a revolutionary technology and $ talks. When it can be demonstrated how much money can be saved on transaction costs and fraud reduction, pretty much any market would be daft not to follow. This is going to be a game changer.

There's a number of different companies. ASICMINER is both a mining pool and a mining hardware manufacturer. They pay shareholders a proportion of the bitcoins they mine and also a proportion of the income generated by hardware sales. These dividends are denominated in bitcoins.
