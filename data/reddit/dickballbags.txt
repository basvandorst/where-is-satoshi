If only I had those numbers to work with..
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:45:40
Hah, it would take you plenty more time than that to read them. :)
What was passed doesn't even meet the initial "four simple goals".
  
* You could argue about 1 - their changes in taxes for individuals are only temporary, and by changing to chained CPI, result in tax increases for the middle class within 7 years. 
* 2 - It didn't simplify the tax code at all, it actually made it more complicated - no, you will not be filing your taxes on a postcard (though it was a nice gimmick - it was also a lie).
* 3 - We'll see how this turns out, there isn't much we can go on but estimates at this point
* 4 - Even the most generous analysis done by the right-leaning Tax Foundation found that the resulting economic growth would still add $448 billion to the deficit.
Basically almost nothing in that document is what actually got passed and signed into law.  The CBO analysis isn't guaranteed to be accurate, but it's the best non-partisan estimate we have to go on, developed by the people who are most familiar with forecasting such impacts.  Could they be wrong?  Sure, but why start with the assumption that they will be?

Ten guys going out to drink together at the same bar, drinking the same beer, in the same quantities doesn't even come close to being analogous with our system of taxation.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:34:49
A president doesn't come into office and make meaningful changes right away, and if they do, they're broad sweeping changes that you can see like the stimulus spending when Obama took office to turn around the tanking economy.  The change will happen gradually as things get passed through congress.  This tax rewrite was legitimately one of the only things that Trump can actually claim credit for actually getting done since taking office, and even that won't have any major impact for another year down the road.  It likely will not be a better GDP growth than any under Obama (though possible).  The economy fluctuates, he's not doing anything stellar in comparison as everyone seems to think.  Take a look at this historical chart:    Not uncommon for Obama to have quarters significantly higher than Trump.

Fair enough.

I send bitcoin from gdax all the time.  No fees involved for crypto or ach deposits and withdraws.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:29:12
... it isn't a company
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:37:17
Nothing.  Expect it instead of panicking and selling to them.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:59:22
You've got to be kidding.  Most of those are not attributable to him.  The one that is - taxes - is a giant scam.  What *is* a tax break now, turns into a tax increase later with the move to chained CPI.
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:19:46
Don't forget your tax bill.  You just added to your taxable income.  If you ignore it, penalties will be steep.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:42:30
Impressive how they all trend almost identically in real time.  Quite a bit of trading automation out there.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:37:54
I know there are fees, I’m going there specifically to avoid paying them.  If other people want to pay them, have at it.. don’t let me stop you.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:43:32
You make a profit, you pay taxes.  Get the fuck over it you selfish little cry baby.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:58:01
Ahh, that makes much more sense.  Thanks for the explanation. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:56:36
Uhh yes, that’s exactly what I’m doing.  I have another address and I withdraw my bitcoin to it.  It disappears from one wallet, shows up in the other.  Zero transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:47:16
Create a new empty wallet for this sale, and you’re all set.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:51:10
i didn’t intend to equate sharing to taxes.  I used it just as an illustration for when many people learn that their selfish behavior doesn’t always lead to the best consequences.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:46:13
Got it.  So next time someone says how can I avoid such high fees, I’ll get into a semantics argument with them about there actually being fees behind the scenes that they don’t pay for, or see in their accounts, just so they understand clearly that fees are there even if they don’t see them.  I can see how helpful that is.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:45:20
I'm selling all, and putting it all into the Plumbus X!
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:36:27
math is hard

@_date: 2017-12-02 15:09:00
You're probably right.  I didn't catch in one of his other comments that he only pulled out like 10K which isn't likely to change much.  I was thinking perhaps he cashed out 60-100K to pay off loans, which would have had a much larger impact, even with long term gains rates.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:20:31
Even with free trades, you’d be wasting your time on such small amounts.  Could you make a couple dollars? Sure, but knowing when to buy and when to sell is the issue.  Even if you know when to, if the market turns the other direction your free limit trade won’t ever come to pass, making you miss out on whatever gains there might have been.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:59:41
Spending it is cashing in...
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:13:28
Nobody is using it on coinbase - which keeps the transaction load manageable.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:29:12
To the people sending and receiving the coins, yes!  Do I or OP really care if there is a fee that gdax covers for the transaction if it isn’t coming out of our pockets? No.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:59:10
The growth has continued at approximately the same pace that it was prior to him taking office.  You can't look at that trend and say "SEE! it was really bad before, and way better now that I'm in office" when that trend hasn't changed.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:04:28
It’s free from gdax.  You can not believe me all you want, doesn’t bother me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:55:44
You could always mortgage your house, buy more in the dip, and then pay it all off when it hits 100K in the next couple days..
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:49:45
*We* live in a society that allows such a thing to even happen in the first place.  Just because you were never taught that to share your toys as a kid doesn't mean that society doesn't have responsibilities as you grow up.  You don't want to pay taxes? Fine.  Go live somewhere that you don't have to pay them.
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:08:35
I hope you set enough aside to cover your tax bill, because it will be substantial.  If you didn't penalties will be substantial too.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:11:23
Good thing bitcoin is a company.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:57:05
They were correct on the popular vote.  Unfortunately, total vote counts don't determine the president here.  Polling data and tax data is extremely different, and doesn't even really compare in this context.  Fair enough on not living in the USA though. :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:47:10
I think those look more like horns than ears..
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:56:07
As long as you're willing to lose it (which you should be), then jump in at any time.  None of us knows where this will end up.  Might be an amazing time to jump in now, might be the highest it ever goes.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:23:33
Proves that you were taught about as much growing up as I had originally thought.  Just selfish belligerence.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:58:44
Yes, gains are taxable upon spending.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:13:06
It’s literally posted all over the Internet.  I posted the link above.
For clarification: If I have .5 BTC in my gdax wallet, and I send it to my personal Armory wallet, or my Kraken wallet, all .5 of it will show up.  No cost to me. Any associated fees do *not* come out of my pocket/wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:43:57
Oh let's see here.. first 4 men pay nothing.   So, they don't pay any payroll taxes that go toward Social Security and Medicare?  They don't pay any state or local taxes, no sales tax?  The system of taxation in our society has been established over a long history with a variety of different economic incentives and drivers, none of which equate to splitting up a beer bill.  Lowering taxes is not bad all by itself.  Lowering taxes on the wealthy *more* than on the lower class is bad.  Ripping out the individual mandate which will lead to millions more uninsured (which we will all pay for) is bad.  Moving tax bracket calculations to chained CPI is bad - it means a tax *increase* for everyone in the long run.  A $400+billion to 1.2 trillion addition to the national deficit **after** resulting economoic growth is accounted for - is bad.  It's not about short-sighted tax cuts and how everyone should be happy about paying less, it's about the big picture of how such things were handled and the actual impacts they will actually have.

Sometimes it only takes 4 minutes..
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:59:33
Your depth of thought and analytical skills are truly astounding.  Really?! Your source you point me to is a 2015 document that holds almost zero resemblance to what was just passed?!  Come back with some actual logic and numbers to back up your argument if you want to be taken seriously.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:41:17
That’s fine with me.  I sent money from coinbase initially and paid the high fees.  It wasn’t hidden, it was right in my face.  I knew exactly how much I was being charged.  I went to gdax specifically to avoid paying those fees.  If it comes to an end at some point, that’s fine.  I’ll avoid paying them while I can, others can pay them as much as they want.
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:14:39
Nobody does, it should be relegated to the trash bin.  I got rid of mine as soon as it showed up in my account.  I refuse to ever deal with it again.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:24:13
Diversify all you want.  If bitcoin tanks, they all likely tank.  See what good diversification would have done in this last downturn.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:23:33
That’s what the blockchain is best at!
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:16:08
I’m not backpedaling. I said I paid no fees.  I paid no fees.  All money I sent shows up wherever I sent it to. The receiver does not pay either.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:14:27
Here is what actually passed:
CBO analysis:
That is a start, there's plenty of other resources out there.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:57:32
We'll just have to wait and see, instead of throwing a big fit about how it hasn't wrapped up yet.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:28:59
Shh.. they don't want to look beneath the surface message.  Easy talking points only.  Tax cuts good.  Stock market records good. ISIS bad, so we must have destroyed them.  When you ask for details, they won't show up, because they don't exist.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:50:49
bcash is not a real alternative.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:19:04
It's not media manipulation if it's true.  And it is true.  Also, pretty sure Mueller has some charges coming down the pipe for Donald.  He's just not playing his cards for everyone to see.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:01:14
I've got one thanks.  I'm not the one wearing the tinfoil hat saying everything is a conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:00:18
I know exactly what I’m investing in.  Don’t think for a minute that bitcoin places you on an island devoid of social and civic responsibility, you’ll be sorely mistaken.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:35:58
Currently?  Making money and paying taxes on it.    Oh Ayn, you have such devoted followers.
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:45:58
You sound too far gone to even try to reason with.  Good luck with that world view.
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:48:14
You do know that we track such information.  You can't spew shit out like "the economy was bad" when it clearly was not, and has not significantly improved since Trump took office.  If you have evidence, please share it.
