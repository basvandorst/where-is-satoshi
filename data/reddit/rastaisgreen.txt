Yo... Paypal fucked me when I tried to buy BTC way back when that was an actual avenue of getting bitcoins. Nice to see they've changed, but also still bitter

Acquiring Bitcoins really suck,
They always leave me a floating duck.
All i want is point-three bitcoin sack,
But vendors want the shirt off my back.
RedditorRed, i've had a change of luck!

fair enough, i can see the drawbacks as many people have pointed it out to me. I found a website that allows you to buy small amounts of BTC via google checkout. Seem's to be a happy medium, but the prices he has are grossly inflated.

Let's be real. If a company as big as google releases something into it's already wide range of applications and tools that are used by many millions of people per day, it's more likely to take hold than bitcoin

This looks awesome. If someone could buy bitcoins from credit card with this smoothly from Mt Gox, that would be the bee's knees. Only concern is how smoothly it functions, and if shuffling currency around on this is a pain
