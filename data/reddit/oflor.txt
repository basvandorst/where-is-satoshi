Easy, just make shitload of wallets.

So are you just proposing to make mBTC default currency?

Why everyone thinks bitcoin's algorythm is perfect? It's bad enough for cryptomoney and it's horrible for nearly anything else. And there is already an "ambitious project has been launched that could one day replace the current internet" called I2P. Please stick to it, do not make countless useless forks.

And how is that useful? Just a big useless QR code.

What does 48K and 243K mean? Amount of bitcoins in block's transactions?

Centralized developers for a decentralized currency, what a bad combination.

h0 = 100 km
v = (320-100) km / 28 h = 7.85 km/h
h = 384000 km
t = (384000-100) km / 7.85 km/h = 48904 h = 2037 d = 5.6 years

This is actually not so hard to implement. You can create 0btc-transactions which contain your address's name signed by address's private key. It is even possible to do this without modifying the protocol, someone will just need to create softfare for exctracting this information from the Blockchain.

How many electrons make up letter "A"? Bitcoins are contained in transactions (in their unspent outputs). If we present blocks in JSON, 1 BTC exactly is 1 symbol which is 1 byte in UTF-8.
But if it's 1.000001 BTC of 0.9999999 BTC, it costs a lot of more bytes. How do you even convert information to electrons? Protons/electrons? Positrons/electrons?

This doesn't mean there should be even more definitions of the one word. There are not many words which define more than one kind of unit, let it stay that way.

Spent a minute thinking how is that related to @_date: 2014-03-27 13:46:40
"This drink costs 4000 bits of Bitcoin"
"Ok i'll design that website for 350,000 bits of Bitcoin"
"Wow did you hear about the guy who bet 1,000,000 bits of Bitcoin on the game yesterday?"
It wouldn't change if this word will be used that way. But you are saying that you want this word to be used as name of currency, which means the definition would change.
Clearly you are wrong.

No way. Bit is a unit of information, not money.
