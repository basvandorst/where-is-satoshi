See Coindesk: The Bitcoin ATM in Bratislava was installed before either one:

I'm not into swiss law but they want to make sure that when you buy bitcoin from the atm so you don't spend the bitcoin directly to a 3rd person. It's an Money Laundring Issue (GwG). What u do afterwards when you received your Bitocins is not rellevant because then its not an ATM Issue any more.

I agree in that specific point. It is easy to delegate all pending issues like anonymity, fungability, and many more just to 'second layer will solve' if your book is about bitcoin. But at the bottom line a very strong performance.

The Bitcoin-value doesn't matter. It's the technology inside Bitcoin that will change the World!
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:25:09
It's natural. The same will happen to AnonCoin and QuarkCoin. And the Race will go on, at the moment only China is dealing with Crypto Currency. Let's wait for India to start with BTC, LTC &amp;Co.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:30:35
It natural Human wants to have the choice. So we will have more than one currency. The question is: Is it good or bad for BTC to have more than one Currency? And Which Currency is surviving? QRK, AnonCoin, Wordcoin?
