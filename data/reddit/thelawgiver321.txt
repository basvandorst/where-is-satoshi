Sure they do. Do you have any idea the fuckin crazy shit that banks underwrite? Lmao it night be one of the least crazy things they could

I disagree. The main point and attractive constant of bitcoin is that it's decentralized and bank-immune. If you remove the immunity, the entire allure of this investment is piss-and-shit. 
This isn't political, this is basic ideology. Stop fucking with the ideology and then being like "whaaaaat, it's not that baaaaaad thooouuggghhh".
Because that's what a fucking bank would say.

Don't worry that other guy doesn't know what he's talking about. If he did, he'd have said that this is the Teamster's tactic. It's the biggest union in the country and it's their infamous instant-PR-shitstorm weapon because once it's out there it's on papers and they've been around for 100 years so everyone knows that the business is screwing the workers.

Guys use your brains. This currency is wide open to market manipulation. First the firm's ran Titanic media campaigns alongside deep pocket manufactured demand to drive price sky high. They cashed out hard, the price plummeted, and now they're running campaigns to drive the price to rock bottom....just so they can do it again - *because they can.*
Ignore these people. They may even be bots and shills, let alone fools.

Because the gray black rat is the tactic of what Teamster Union does when they think they're getting fucked in negotiations.

It's simple. That one entity has so much purchasing power that they WANT to crash it at 6k so they can buy A SHITLOAD at a crashed price, knowing full well that it'll fly high soon enough. The market is completely and absolutely succeptible to manipulation, and this is manipulation 101. Crash it to capitalize on it so your overall stake is multiple times stronger in the long run.

Basically, they place a huge option on futures that it's going to tank. Then they sell off and force it to tank.  Then they take their winnings and buy a shitload of coin at the bottom, pumping it back high. Winning a shitload of money by manually manipulating it. Easy.

Can confirm. It manager hospital by 27. Started at 24. Turned gaming hobby into a basic tech job. Changed title every year. Just doing the best I could at understanding everything. Google and on the job training is all it took, and only used Google to learn basic competencies with network functions. Learned virtual desktops quickly and solidified my role and became manager. No certs. 4 yrs college no degree. Lots of charisma, excellent communication and being nice while simultaneously objective and realistic. Cool heads in crisis management a huge plus. Understanding of escalation paths most important. Jobs not hard. Now I build offices for new acquisitions from construction to new network, new system and network conversions. The whole shabang. Just try hard.

You guys aren't used to thinking evil enough. Every other market has fail-safes in place except for crypto. Plus classe 102 is dedicated to shorting the shit out of the Bitcoin while ur doing a sell off, with guaranteed odds to win a huge bet

OH OH OH I BET I KNOW. they couldn't find a tax professional competent enough to figure out how to file their gains and cut if off due to potential IRS hammers. I've got fifty bucks on it, blind.

Honestly Bitcoin will be there gold standard in an evolving world of crypto currency. This should be a retirement investment for 99% of us, and the last 1% are wicked strong Banks pulling market manipulation or just normal gamblers. Accept it for what it is and just hold. Otherwise hey good luck
