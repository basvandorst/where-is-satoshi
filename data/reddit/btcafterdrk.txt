Can I get delivery right now??

Wow, just a block from work, maybe I'll swing by today.  Make sure all your workers are comfortable receiving payment in BTC as I want to impress my coworkers with how seamless the transaction will be.

The future is bright, nice work guys.

Have a scooby snack.  If you're there at lunchtime I'll pop by someday!  @_date: 2014-11-11 03:57:05
Thank you!  Will pay it forward!
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:41:57
Restaurant?  I'll stop by soon.

I see no problem referring to that as midtown.  While some say 34th, many consider it to reach to 14th.

"No one has asked the question yet, so I haven't stated it, but when I finally gathered a small group of employees to pressure Mark into answering how we spent more money than we've made, his answer was simply:
"My grandmother lives in a castle in switzerland"
That was it. That was all, we couldn't get him to explain it. He just ignored the rest of our inquiries. It. was. insane."

I use the app too, but I was talking about the USD wallet.

OK, well when I went to Circle it said "Currently, only residents of the below states are eligible to hold US dollars with Circle. We are working with all fifty states, and international banking partners, to expand our offering to as many people as possible."  New York was not on the list, so all signs pointed that way for me...

Not available in NY, imagine that!

If you attach a credit card for backup in case something happens with the bank transfer, you should be good to go.

You'd have to enable instant buy with verification.  What country are you in?

I just knew Gavin lived in Amherst, and I grew up there too...and know of a Lucas who I wouldn't be surprised to see wandering the redditsphere.
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:51:32
Is Lucas in Amherst?

Yes, very much so.  kwanijml has the right idea.

Hold on to that 5 percent hope, and go direct to the source next time.  Bitcoin can help remove the pimps from the equation.  I wouldn't sweat it though.
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:02:45
Loving it!

How about .00001 BTC goes out into a community pool that gets divided up between all the people who don't hit the snooze button on that given day.
@_date: 2015-10-31 19:11:36
I got unlocked in a few minutes.  But yes, be careful there.
@_date: 2015-10-06 02:39:35
Yes, all demand will have an influence on price.
