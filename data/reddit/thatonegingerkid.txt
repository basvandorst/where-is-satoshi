Well its better than deflation. At least inflation, to an extent, encourages spending. Deflation just means no one wants to spend any of their money, which kills the economy


Source? Since the 80s inflation has been quite low in the US, no where close to being "rampant"

"having the balls" to commit massive fraud and steal money from people's pockets

Saying that the fed "manipulates" the entire economy is so disingenuous. Everything the Fed does to *guide* the economy is public knowledge and is governed by the dual mandate, it's not some voodoo being done in a secret room in Washington

bubbles do not need to cause excess production, just misallocation of capital. Bitcoin trading at $19k when its fundamentals had not changed since the beginning of 2017 was a clear example of speculation fueled over-investment. Idk how you can look at bitcoin prices over the past 18 months and not call it a bubble. Also, it is just as likely that bitcoin plummets to zero as it does roar back to $20k, no one knows what will happen

Ok now I get what you mean. I'll admit sometimes I treat bitcoin too much like a security and forget that so much of it is completely illiquid. Thanks for the clarification

Unless you have the ability to change the price point of COIN then no it does not. That's like saying if a firm does a block purchase of stocks at a discount, they would decrease the market cap of that stock, which is not true as their transaction is not impacting the price point in any significant way. Also, I am still more curious about a source for the 50x multiplier and the conclusion you reached off of that.

Market Cap is generally defined as price*shares outstanding, or I suppose coins outstanding in this case. Do you have any links to the reasoning behind bitcoin market cap being 50x what its traditional market cap would be defined as?

Well not as a paper check but as someone still in college, yes that is exactly how it works. I get my money direct deposited in to my account every semester

What part of monetary economics makes bitcoin a sure thing? I'm not an expert but I am an economics major and have taken several monetary economics courses so I'm curious

I've had friends who barely know what the stock market is ask me about how to invest in bitcoin. So yeah, it is just name recognition since they saw all the crazy gains last year. For almost all of the cryptocurrency and bitcoin are synonyms

I understand that this sub is very anti-banks and what not, but that doesn't mean a global depression is good for anyone. You can be pro Bitcoin and also understand that a massive loss in trust for lending and equities markets only serves to cripple economic growth. Not to mention it really wouldn't have an impact on the stability of currency AND the losses would be felt the most by the "little man" that this sub champions

It's almost universally agreed amongst economists that letting the banks fail would have been catastrophic to the US and global economy. Even just letting Lehman fail is now viewed as a major mistake. Anyone who"hates the bailout"and wanted the banks to collapse likely has little to no understanding of either financial markets or economics
