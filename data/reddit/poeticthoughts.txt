Just bought your app! A little advice for future releases of yours, whether it's websites, apps, or any other programming project. Your release day is typically your biggest day, you'll expect the most amount of users at once on this day. So make sure to plan your budget accordingly with that information. (Also you can only publicly release once on Reddit/per subreddit, keep that in mind too).
A lot of projects tend to get overzealous based on their initial returns which ends up diminishing fast. Thanks for the clean app and best of luck to you!

I think the app is fairly well done and already provides more utility for me than others that I use. A few customization things as others mentioned like:
- Theme options
- Ability to change alert sounds
- Load time optimization/different load wheel animation as the one in place is the one that is usually paired with your phone is about to die or app is crashing
Also name choice such as: "UniqueName": Crypto Price Tracker - would help finding your app find a bit easier. Probably because it just launched not too long ago, but I couldn't find your app typing in "crypto price tracker", I had to go to the finance section and look for  This should fix itself up soon but for future releases be aware of that.

What's ESO?

I had this issue as well and eventually recovered my wallet. Question, are spaces allowed in the passwords? If so, try and see if you accidentally inserted a space before or after

Not really, same motive to donate to charities in the most efficient way possible. Transaction fees are an issue we're all aware of and actively trying to fix as soon as possible. Bitcoin will be replaced by any altcoin if we are unable to do so in a reasonable time. Ignoring the problem or demeaning others seeking different payment platforms because ours isn't working is definitely not the way to handle this.

Same, I frequent both subreddits but after a short while I have to leave as things get too one-sided.

There was a post here that someone cross post but it got flagged for removal.

BTC will never hit 100,000+ and stabilize unless it fixes transaction fee issues and confirmation times. It's a stock until those issues are fixed and as a volatile stock it's vulnerable to high bullish runs followed by huge dips. If BTC can fix those two major issues then it can be viable for people to use BTC as their sole currency and that's when true stability at a reasonable growth comes from. 
I do enjoy the large amount of attention BTC is getting but let's not forget it's original purpose was to subvert the banking system and make us independent.

Whoa whoa, lots of hostility there. 
Re: satoshis vision -- That's what BTC cash presented themselves as and I can understand why they were formed. A chinese clone coin wouldn't get as much traction as it has. Having a developer like Gavin Andersen co-sign BTC cash shows it's not just another scheme. 
Don't dismiss an entire group as they had very valid reasons for forming. If BTC can address transaction fees and confirmation times then BTCC utility will fade away, but as it stands right now BTC is just an investment.

You can sell directly to your bank account or payout in several different ways from different exchanges. A lot of people seize their BTC wealth to make themselves richer by selling in different niche ways. For example, selling BTC for a steam gift card or something you could sell it at 10-20%+ the regular rate.

I disagree with your views on BTC cash being scammy but good to hear your entire reasoning flushed out. I'm not promoting bitcoin cash or any other cryptocurrency. I've held BTC since 2009 so I have no reason to push a different currency or try and undermine it. It's important to note what it has evolved to over the years, hopefully transaction fees and confirmation times will be lessened in the future

No point in getting a hardware wallet if you own a USB drive.
Generate some paper wallets, create an encrypted container using Veracrypt (or encrypt the USB) and store your addresses safely on a usb. 
Make some backups, use a long pass phrase, no need to trust any 3rd party manufacturer.

If you use paper wallets, swipe a few addresses, your transaction fees become a lot higher. For security, it's better to spread your BTC wealth among lots of addresses instead of cooping it in one place. 
I maybe recalling this incorrectly but, there was a post long time ago that BTC addresses that send out transactions become susceptible to a potential cryptographic attack in the future but only by quantum super computers or something. I'll edit this comment if I can find the research later.

The closest thing in nature to bitcoin is bitcoin cash, and that will be the end of it. A lot of developers and core believers moved over to BTCC to stick closer to Satoshi's original vision of what Bitcoin should've been. 
There are other interesting cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and litecoin but anything else in the future trying to use the bitcoin in the name is probably a scam.

There will be a be a dip soon. This level of rapid inflation is definitely not healthy. I imagine it'll spike up to maybe 12,400 before going back to 10,000 - 9,800 in the next few days. 
The main issue I see with bitcoin is that it's turning more into a stock than a means of useful currency. It's costs way too much and takes far too long to send $20 to someone. Hopefully scaling solves these issues. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:56:40
Too expensive to send $20 in BTC for a starbucks gift card when it takes $7 to send and 3+ hours to confirm. Until some core issues are fixed it's just an investment to everyone.

Bitcoin has always been top dog and around for the longest time. It's no surprise that if bitcoin is doing well, popular alt cryptocurrencies see a sort of synonymous boost. From an investor standpoint, it's easier to get them to throw cash into BTC as the name has been floating around for quite sometime. Education and exposure will change this more in the future.
