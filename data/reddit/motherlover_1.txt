Technical analysis is pseudoscience bullshit though. Trying to predict the future with the past will lead to untrue assumptions. Believing people that actively push an agenda with nonsensical data is dangerous.

This was everyone’s mindset when I first discovered bitcoin about 4/5 years ago

Look if you want to be a little bitch and complain about people that tip small amounts, be my guest but set the right example. You haven't even tipped a single satoshi so what's your deal?

A financial collapse is not likely to start in the bitcoin market as it is too small to cause that. Usually, investors divert their money into commodities like gold however, some might choose bitcoin instead

I'm not sure if this would be a good idea because these small amount do get more people involved and aware about bitcoin. Look at the huge amount of people that changetip has caused to figure out what bitcoins are. The lower the possible tip amount, the more people will start using it and eventually some of these people will start using bitcoins for more than just sending a couple cents.

* "It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a website, it's not okay to be a website with a reddit account."
* If over 10% of your submissions are your own site/content/affiliate links, you're almost certainly a spammer.
So it's entirely different from making a living of bitcoin and discuss bitcoin

Keep it going mate!

Well posing as a changetip enthusiast when you really are an employee trying to market a company is pretty lame and selfpromotion is again intergalactic law

Well if you take into account that the merchant is willing to take a huge exchange rate risk in a highly volatile market, he should be charging more

The little tips by themselves are not likely to cause a price increase however, tipping can make people aware about how simple it is to use and cause more people to start using bitcoins for other things as well. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 13:05:24
Very nice threat! Love the generosity. Keep it up!

Little Johnny was sitting in class doing math problems when his teacher picked him to answer a question, "Johnny, if there were five birds sitting on a fence and you shot one with your gun, how many would be left?" "None," replied Johnny, "cause the rest would fly away." "Well, the answer is four," said the teacher, "but I like the way you're thinking."  Little Johnny says, "I have a question for you. If there were three women eating ice cream cones in a shop, one was licking her cone, the second was biting her cone and the third was sucking her cone, which one is married?"  "Well," said the teacher nervously, "I guess the one sucking the cone."  "No," said Little Johnny, "the one with the wedding ring on her finger, but I like the way you're thinking."

Take it or leave it. Just gotten into it and don't have much in my changetip wallet.

Yea, I would move it to a more secure place if I were you. And if you are into gambling, consider depositing some of that to primedice, it is really cool!

It's still more than fake tipping a 100 bucks dumbass.
