This gets said a lot, but its always worth repeating: don't invest more than you can afford.
Other than that just have fun. 
Poke around google for answers to those questions, they have already been answered hundreds of times.

A BitInstant cash payment is your best bet, but there have been a lot of complaints about their service lately. Bank verifications take days.
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:43:00
No, but it will certainly have an impact on the price.
They've been working to expand their services for the US and Canada over the past several months:

I'm well aware of NORML ( but WTF is NORMAL?

How about educating the public about the actual meanings of the word "hacker," rather than telling people they shouldn't use correct terminology?

If anyone knew they'd be a millionaire in no time, and they wouldn't tell anyone about it.

Happened to me today and yesterday too (bought at $90 at $78), even though I've used the same account to buy Bitcoin from Coinbase at least 10 times already.
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:59:44
It might may probably maybe almost could be a great time to get into Bitcoin.

Thanks for the review, I was wondering if anyone had a good experience. I personally think this looks like a much better Amazon payment solution than BitSpend.

I bought 1 BTC today at 4:54 EST, but I wish I'd waited a bit longer.
Try using coinbase-trader. Be nice, don't break their servers.

It's still early. People were making these same kind of gifs when the price jumped from $7 to $30 last January

You all will get excited about anything, as long as bitcoin is in the title.

Large rises like this ($49 high) will likely stabilize by the end of the day at a more reasonable gain like $45 where its at now. I doubt the market will bottom out in the foreseeable future.
Go ahead and sell though; I don't really care about your potential earnings, just mine.

Don't tell me what I do or don't own.

I doubt they are "getting rid of" these miners, they are just making money off of a hot product.
These are a sought after items which recently had a major price increase. There are tens of thousands of people lined up to get first access to these machines, so someone could feasibly make more money reselling pre-orders than by mining bitcoin.

If I knew for sure I'd be rich

Gox was frozen at $78. When it the market started updating again Coinbase went back online.
@_date: 2013-03-15 15:53:50
Looks like a small site update.

Silk Road has been back up for the last two days.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:31:53
Probably not much at all. SR was down from last week til today. Its back up now and seems to have had little impact on Bitcoin prices.
@_date: 2013-03-18 19:32:55
Should have done that 10 minutes ago
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:27:45
I can never find anything I'm looking for on BitcoinStore. I keep trying but its just so damn difficult.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:49:58
Silk Road was down all last week and Bitcoin prices soared. The site is back up today and prices are dropping.
I think its safe to say there is not much correlation between the two. Bitcoin is already much bigger than SR.
@_date: 2013-02-06 03:19:09
Yea its driving me crazy. Glad its not just me.

Seems obvious but worth stating:

The Blockchain API seems to be working but the website is still not connecting to the server.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:30:26
Thats awesome that they are making us confirm our purchases now that their site is down.
@_date: 2013-05-06 14:37:09
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:27:17
Plus the original site is still up saying they've had to shut down

Go to Walmart. Even CVS is a terrible experience compared to Moneygram at Walmart. The volume of customers keeps them from dragging their asses.

As far as I know the Capitol360 deposit method does not exist. I had my account verified last week and the option never became available, even though its listed in the FAQ. 
I contacted support over a week ago about it, still no response.
