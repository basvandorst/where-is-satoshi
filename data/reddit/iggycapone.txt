In our case, we believe in bitcoin. All the bitcoin made by our shop will be used in future bitcoin transactions to help along more standard usage of the crypto. In the future, we hope to be able to get supplies and goods for our shop with bitcoin. We are also offering any bitcoin made as a payment process for our coworkers.

Currently we do not have have a website. Most of business has been generated by word of mouth, as the quality of our work has spoken for itself. Now that bitcoin has the owners attention, i am sure a website will be coming soon. Maybe a possibilty for any developers out there in the bitcoin community in the near future.

Yeah, really just want to get the local conversations started and see what we can come up with as a community. The possibilities are endless...

Hopefully we will have this "problem" because that would mean we take a bunch of orders in bitcoin payments. We feel if that becomes the case, enough suppliers and other companies will be accepting the currency as well and we will be able to conduct most of our business in bitcoin. As of today in business, cash is still king and will be at least for the near future but we believe in bitcoin and want to be a part of it.
