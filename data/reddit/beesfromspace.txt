There are no easy temporary fixes, increasing the block-size is not reversible and will harm the project in the long run.

These is a great update, I do not understand the avg reaction. Lightning is the way forward and this is a nice steppingstone.

BitWasp looks like it has still a long way to go.
Their test-site is a mess, documentation is lacking and it is not really what I was looking for.
And yes I could have simply made a button with the address and the terms, and keep everything manual.
But hell this is a digital currency, it should be possible for everyone without to much knowledge or third parties to make it user-friendly for the customer in a digital environment right?
If you want the userbase to grow, you will need these kind of tools.

As far as I know there aren't any that work without some kind of 3rd party.
It would be nice if someone with the know-how could utilise bitcoinaddress.js and bitcoinprices.js and turn it into a more accessible solution. I think the community would benefit a lot from a simple independent set of tools to make a simple button.
(but than again, perhaps something like that already exists and I am just not uptodate enough.)

Yes they do,
But should I integrate an entire platform like WooCommerce and restyle all their basic elements so it fits with the look and feel of the current website just in order to get a "pay with bitcoins"-button?
Also the latest versions of WooCommerce are to tightly locked with their WooThemes (which of-course makes sense from their point of view) resulting in a mess each time they update the plugin.
I'm just asking for a simple solution ; )
