They keep a copy of the seed, means they have access to your wallet, it's a scam all right. Your wallet should be privately yours,

I love trading, it's a mad rush but will never say it's easy, been studying properly for over a year and I'm still making more losses than gains.
Best way is to start with a dummy account and practice with monopoly money.

Quantum computing is probably the biggest threat to bitcoin but I'm sure there's time to fork to an even more robust technology to counteract such threat 
I'd be more worried for fiat, they have less defense against a quantum attack.

It's strange how Iranian adoption of BTC has gone down lately, can't figure it out

Trustnodes explain referring to their main exchange exir.io 
The free market rate of one TMN to the dollar is 13,350. One bitcoin is trading at 123,500,000 TMN, or about $9,300. Roughly the same as in other global exchanges.
Trading volumes on this exchange appear to be very low too, just $50,000 for bitcoin in the past 24 hours.

Really feel for you buddy, it could happen to anybody. On deepnet, IV come across my own private emails out there in the open net, horrified I changed to the most secure system in the world, pen and paper.

They can't, they would just drive it underground, all they can do is discriminate it. After attacking it for years they now realize that Pandora's box cannot be closed. If I had my way, I'd make printing free dollars illegal.

Living in UK, you'd think everyone knows about bitcoin, truth is, I work in a big company with over 400 employees and IV actually given up on trying to explain bitcoin and Blockchain. Seems like no one really wants to know. I get home and even my family don't understand or want to know about my crypto. The only friends I can ever speak to about crypto is you lot ( which I really do appreciate). Crypto is lonely but il never give it up for the world. It's not just my future, it's our future. Wish people could see this.

Not scared, just a bit of warrenophobia or buffetophobia I guess, lol

Makes me wonder, if BTC was illegal everywhere and trading carried a hefty prison sentence, reckon price could drop to minus zero one day?

Imagine a country where everything is voted by Blockchain, it would be the end of all political dishonesty. On the other hand, check the Borg out in star trek. There you go, a very quick and basic example of both.

It's a bit like when a soul leaves the body, the wallet turns into a carcass while the funds go out into the unknown.

I bought in a whole eth at 965, here we are almost a year later and due to trading, I'm down to 0.22 eth but tell you what, wouldn't change it for the world. With all I've learnt, just know I'll eventually get me money back and more. Eyes are open, ready for 2019.
All we have to do is to carry on banging against that wall
HODL forever

Crypto land seems a bit quiet today, expecting lower volume than usual, stop loss at 5744, thoughts anybody?

I tried the John mcaffe BTC play quizz app. It's fun, one can only get around 3 dollars worth of BTC per month but it all adds up
