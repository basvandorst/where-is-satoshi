How do you keep track of your total % gained/loss on each purchase? 
Maybe a dumb question but if I start buying a $100 a week at a different price each time how are you keeping track of each transactions %gain/loss so you can see your overall% growth? 
Is there a bitcoin portfolio website you use to track your transactions %gains/losses ? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:21:05

Idk where else to ask this coinbase support non existant and r/coinbase is just a complain haven with no response. 
On coinbase has anyone logged in from a different ip address (you verify it) but then it changed your weekly buy/sell limits to the very first level? Even after you've provided all verification proof of address all steps etc etc. prior 
Only other thing I can think is I transferred to cold storage but idk why that would effect your weekly limit
Transferring to cold storage and logging in from different ip...since then my limits went back to the basic like I just signed up. Anyone have this happen?

I have a max limit amount of $$$ I can transfer to Coin base per week. But coinbase is telling me I have more of my weekly bank limit remaining than I should. 
Basically if I didn't do the math myself and did what coinbase said I would go over the weekly limit coinbase said I have. 
Shit idk if that makes sense but if you understand and know why this happens I'm curious to know?

Bitcoin is the future of online purchases. It seems safer than putting my credit card/debit card online. Although difficult for the non-technical to set up securely. This running ubuntu Linux OS isn't for the everyday average person working a 9-5. The trezor seems easy enough but the process of buying bitcoin and getting it onto the trezor is unsettling if you're gonna buy 5 or 6 bitcoin and want to make sure you did it right.
