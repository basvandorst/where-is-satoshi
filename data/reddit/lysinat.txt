He probably will. It's only been a couple days, and he started expressing doubts after Wright published that nonsense post instead of actual proof.
Smart, skeptical people get scammed. All the time. We're all a bunch of dumb apes with emotions that can be manipulated. Gavin made a mistake, but people are acting like he's an idiot or a criminal. Nah.
No harm in a little patience and sympathy. Though if he continues to support Wright now, then he's an idiot.

As long as you're accurately transcribing what somebody claims, that's apparently good journalism. There's very little interest in checking facts.

Sure, but they're not experts. And strangely, it seems like Wright hasn't used his Satoshi claim to scam money out of people or anything like that.
It's a weird incident, but no big deal for them.

Not meaningfully. Adding initials or a timestamp or whatever is pretty neutral, assuming you're doing the verification independently, with trusted software. Then it's definitely a legitimate signed message which hasn't simply been replayed.
But since the test environment is completely untrustable, we can throw any protocol in the garbage.
I like OP's theory about this being a psychological trick. It's the kind of thing Wright needed to do to make a couple experts temporarily forget the glaring problems with the whole procedure.

Not really. There are enormous red flags all over the place that this is a con.
Either he's Satoshi and has inexplicably chosen to be a complete weirdo about this (when he could trivially provide actual cryptographic proof), or he's a fraud. Those are really your only two options here, and the latter seems vastly more likely. There's no middle ground.
