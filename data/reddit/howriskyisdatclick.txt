WHAT YEAR IS IT?
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:45:18
I've been using it for a while for both BTC and ETH and it works fine for both.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:33:26
Everyone in here was calling ethereum a premined shitcoin literally 1 year ago
@_date: 2017-02-11 15:22:14
It's the perfect crime.

Why not 1.362842? The man has reasons.
@_date: 2017-02-14 15:06:30
So many things that could be good for it, so few that could be bad. Plus fingers crossed for the ETF!

@_date: 2017-02-09 03:42:01
You sure? I was thinking about selling after this.
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:30:51
No getting off this ride.
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:39:37
Don't quote me on this but it's not on a major exchange or something. Also there's some other reason.
@_date: 2017-02-15 19:29:10
I never said I didn't.

@_date: 2017-02-07 18:50:18
psst, put everything in WINS, thank me later
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:10:13
So no capital or business costs?
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:50:39
A lot of people have problems with it, also their instant buy fees are ridiculous. I buy from them and move the coins to a bread wallet until I can get them in cold storage.
@_date: 2017-02-01 04:47:17
We don't talk about that anymore.

@_date: 2017-02-14 19:21:12
Age plays a role. Plus the "brand" recognition. If you say bitcoin people know what you're talking about. If you say Iota, you're met with blank stares.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:33:33
It's brutal, but it works.
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:21:51
It would be useful, there will come a day that running a node will be too expensive and we can no longer rely on community service.
@_date: 2017-02-11 16:15:43
If your provider doesn't limit you why not do it? I am and I don't care if it uses a terabyte per month, it's good for my investment.

Looks like GDAX, I prefer bitfinex myself.
@_date: 2017-02-11 16:21:13
I'm not sure a rejection would sink the price that much, no one really thinks it's going to happen this time. Now if it gets *approved*...
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:46:45
This. People ask what running a node can do for them, is it not in your best interest for bitcoin to become stronger?
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:07:51
I have Chase and they have been really good about Coinbase/Circle.
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:04:08
They account for .6% of hashing power. Maybe they'll support segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:11:32
That makes sense, I am running Core on a fresh install of Ubuntu on an old laptop I forgot I even had as my node, though I understand your situation. It may be a bit strange but maybe you could just run something low-power from a friends house and give them like .005 btc per month?
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:38:45
Seems like it might be done.
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:51:22
Me too
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:12:44
Coinbase has a tendency of "experiencing excessive load" during times of crisis to avoid everyone getting on and selling, plus if they are on Coinbase they are not your coins, Coinbase owns them.
I've also heard stories of CB shutting down peoples account and they have to fight to get their money back.

@_date: 2017-02-08 09:38:27
Or shorting. Fucking criminals.
@_date: 2017-02-16 14:26:00
I use a Shift card linked to coinbase if I want to spend bitcoin on things, I just but more btc right after though.

The network can't handle this yet, do you know how many people browse reddit without an account?
@_date: 2017-02-15 20:36:00
How many conformations does the transaction need? To transfer from my cold storage to my coinbase account it needs 3 confirmations, which translates to 30 minutes if I payed an acceptable fee.
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:02:34
That's what I'm saying, it's bouncing back just fine.
@_date: 2017-02-15 16:17:08
Open a paper wallet.
Tattoo the 12 or 24 word seed in a ring around your anus.
Burn the paper wallet.
That is what I did.
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:45:20
Just call PBoC and tell them to crash the price tomorrow again.
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:15:43
I made an account just to use the chart, you don't have to provide any id. Or just click demo.
@_date: 2017-02-02 00:26:45

@_date: 2017-02-11 16:09:03
Tattoo the private key in a ring around your anus like I did.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:24:26
It solves the problem *in theory*
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:21:16
They can already sell their coins, they just can't pull them off the exchange, allegedly.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:49:57
You sure?
@_date: 2017-02-28 13:52:08
Yeah hate to say it but Eth is up near all time high.
@_date: 2017-02-03 16:30:34
What software? Core?
Set up port forwarding for your ip for port 8333. 21.co has a tool for testing to see if the network can reach your node.
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:53:14
I don't really think they're relevant anymore, but I'm sure they like it.
@_date: 2017-02-15 20:39:12

I like bitfinex.com myself, just seems clean and professional.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:42:30
Like an hour, idk though
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:50:18
I had one once that the bitcoin code had a hole and it went to $0. That was the night before the big crash in January.
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:31:55
I would say don't worry about it
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:36:17
I just picked up more too at 960, I bet you we're back to $1020 by lunch.
@_date: 2017-02-16 17:19:42
Nah I'm not worried.
@_date: 2017-02-12 21:05:43
Yeah previously it was like 10%.

Also let's say you group up with 2 more people, each remember just 3 words.
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:20:02
So many people use reddit without an account. The network is not ready for this influx.
Hold me I'm scared.
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:45:46
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:08:40
Looks like I'm extending my position ��
@_date: 2017-02-11 13:20:39
Google it, I hope you didn't have a significant amount in there though. I see phone wallets as like real wallets, keep $100 or so in there if you lose it, it's no huge deal. Hardware wallets are like a savings account to keep large amounts in.
@_date: 2017-02-03 13:55:09
For now...
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:16:33
You need to find the ip address of your node that your router is assigning it, I can help but first what kind of knowledge on networking do you have?
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:21:54
I thought it was neat.
@_date: 2017-02-03 16:55:35
I'm not sure, hopefully someone who uses it can chime in.
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:32:18
I just put those together but yeah technically 4.
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:58:36
Probably anywhere from $100k to half a million.
@_date: 2017-02-18 11:34:00
This is the best answer so far. You can't expect to just sell half a million dollars of btc and not expect the FBI/IRS to breaking down your door. They need a lawyer, and possibly a CPA immediately.
@_date: 2017-02-18 11:40:27
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:03:19
Maybe, or maybe not.
@_date: 2017-02-13 21:52:45
True but it's not a full node.

@_date: 2017-02-11 18:01:03
Exchanges. I've heard something about "OTC exchanges" but I'm not sure what it is. Or a contract with a miner.
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:57:30
Coinbase, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-02-10 22:43:24
It's kind of nonsense unless I'm not understanding it correctly.
@_date: 2017-02-11 15:08:20
Is that really a good idea though for something like this?
@_date: 2017-02-13 16:34:41
I would not go into debt to buy btc. Use whatever liquid assets you can but don't use a credit card.
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:31:50
3.2 million
@_date: 2017-02-28 13:24:17
Me too
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:34:45
Anyone who bought over 1160 has lost money. I hope in time you can see my way of thinking.
Edit: also, 170% returns in a week is not idiotic.
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:01:29
Actually from the vacuum, but same concept.

At some point, depends on what is actually happening.
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:24:13

@_date: 2017-03-17 21:12:12
That's the way crypto goes.
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:54:02
It is in my best interest to keep the network secure, therefore I am motivated to run a node on an old laptop for basically no cost.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:26:29
I think I watched a porno with that name.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:07:17
I stopped reading after you called Vitalik a nutcase. I honestly feel bad for some of the people here blindly following advice from people like you. Seriously, they stand to lose a lot of money clinging to, unfortunately, outdated tech. I'm not saying Eth is the future, but it seems to have the clearest path to the  spot.
@_date: 2017-02-11 16:10:22
Could be legal issues for Coinbase, they probably wouldn't be to happy with you using their service where you're not supposed to.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:29:34

I can say with 100% certainty that 1 of 3 things will happen. Either the price goes up, it goes down, or it stays the same. I'm not sure which will happen but it will be one of those.
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:10:25
It might bounce back to your wallet, or so I've been told.
Edit, no it won't. Thought I heard somewhere it would
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:49:34
I feel like we should be able to have an open and honest discussion about it. I don't own any of it, but honestly what makes it inferior?

@_date: 2017-02-10 01:45:07
Who knows
@_date: 2017-02-09 12:27:58
Start running a Core node.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:27:09
Right, If I'm trying to store thousands of dollars I would choose bitcoin, if I'm trying to give someone $10 I think ETH works better.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:45:36
Volume went from 11k to 40k on bitfinex
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:49:26
For large sums of money yes of course bitcoin is better, it probably always will be. But for someone like me that wants to be able to pay between friends for beer and pizza, eth works better.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:07:20
I don't believe it's ever happened, could be wrong though.

Ah, I see. Thought you meant because the price was down for a second.
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:15:23
If you're kidding you forgot the /s. It's where ETHs market cap exceeds BTCs, making ETH the top crypto.

Nah I still love it
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:20:28
I wouldn't, that's too high!
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:11:30
I paid $4 for 1 transaction and it took over an hour. Then I sent some ETH and it cost roughly $0.02 and took 3 minutes to get a confirmation.
Edit: Check my history, I'm a regular here and even run a Core node. I'm not advocating one crypto over another as I own both.

You have to expect crazy volatility today.

So uhh, you should maybe PM me your address, just so I can help keep it safe.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:02:40
I've left the community in favor of Eth until this gets sorted out. Or maybe it never gets sorted out who knows.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:26:45
That's because everyone is convulsing and can't read because our vision is blurring. Work is hard today.

@_date: 2017-03-09 21:12:43
Not 100% sure but if the wallet doesn't exist the miners will decline the transition and your account will get the coin back. I think that's how it works, give it 3 days and see if it's back.

I can't find any reason why anyone is still here. I traded the last of my btc for eth a week ago.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:25:00

If bitcoin can't reach consensus I'm confident Eth will overtake btc. I already sold my bitcoin for eth and others are doing the same, which seems wise.

Which Eth stands a better chance of doing.
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:57:17
That's kind of the point of it though, it's not trying to be a competitor to btc, it's trying to be a development platform from what I can tell.

@_date: 2017-01-05 14:41:56
The dust is settling and we're back to a steady increase, my opinion? The price skyrocketed because people were taking out huge leverage positions which they couldn't back up, then when we saw a minor dip margin calls came.
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:00:14
Yup. But you bet I'm pouring a drink for shattering $630! HODL

My gf had me set her up with her own wallet. They're out there.
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:36:23
I asked this a while back. At that point the fees will be enough to keep miners up plus that'll be around 2100 so computers (hopefully) be much much much faster and able to handle transactions easily.
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:57:37
You alright there sport?
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:45:07
Almost all, that's not much to begin with though.

How can something possibly be too slow for the cannabis industry?
@_date: 2016-06-01 15:59:20
~~Right, but after that, what motivation will miners have to keep their hardware running after the last reward? The general answer here is no one knows. Just figured there might have been some kind of plan in place, increased fees maybe.~~
Edit: Wait I see now, the last satoshi can be split indefinitely so theoretically there could be infinite rewards, while staying within the '21 million' limit. Interesting. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 13:10:41
Yeah, he'll see it on business news and either ask about it, or still not care.
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:32:26
Their story is he meant that the 21mm limit isn't a permanent thing and could theoretically be changed, if that's true I'm not 100% sure.
@_date: 2017-01-12 16:58:39
BUY BUY BUY

Yes, but also, no.
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:01:49
Maybe, but also maybe not. Either way it won't change the long term, and it'll be a nice opportunity for cheap coins if it does happen.

Thank you for an actual response, I'm sure most of us will be dead and buried by then but I just thought it'd be interesting to see what people thought about this topic.
Edit: Theoretically the last satoshi could be split indefinitely, down to minuscule amounts and have 'infinite' rewards, while keeping right under the 21 million limit.

They can have them for $1,000,000% apiece
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:25:03
This would be awesome. And consider if bitcoin is an asset, why would china not want to be heavily involved in it? They have the opportunity to practically "manufacture" and export "gold". Their economy isn't doing well and with Trump coming to power they need something to export to sustain their country.
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:24:29
I took a picture to remember that moment. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:09:42
They would be converted into us dollars from bitpay right? Plus their finances are an open book and always have been.
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:54:39
Automation is right around the corner, too.
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:17:28
Plus all the currency would flee the country, which is a huge problem right now.

Now that's a stretch
@_date: 2017-01-21 15:25:12
Me too thanks
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:55:48
So you're saying buy at 1000x margins?
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:46:05
Look at the long term, not short term.
@_date: 2017-01-21 15:31:41
Take the cover off, squeeze it so it gets tighter and carefully put it back on.
@_date: 2017-01-12 16:29:12

@_date: 2017-01-06 16:06:06
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:31:35
It's my suspicion that margin trading was a factor in the latest price collapse, or at least the dip would not have been as bad of no one was buying on margin.
@_date: 2017-01-21 15:25:39

@_date: 2017-01-01 18:22:53
Someone thought the price of bitcoin was going to go down so they bought short positions, if the price goes down the positions become more valuable. Look up shorting stocks on youtube for a better explanation.
Edit: If this kind of stuff is interesting to you, go watch the movie The Big Short, it was really good.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:54:14
My opinion, they take out huge short positions, try (key word) to tank the price and make a quick buck. But the price goes up so they lose millions.
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:28:30
I know some of those words!

Yup looks like the dust is settling and we can get back to business. What did we learn today? Don't buy on margin if you can't put your money where your mouth is.

Thats what I do and many others, if you're doing anything illegal or dodging taxes do not go through coinbase, they will watch where your coins go.

Realistically $5000 is when we could see a bit of a sell off, if we're following past trends. Then another bubble to $25,000 and a crash to $10,000 then $125,000 etc over the course of ~8-10 years.

Not sure how credible that is but there's a lot of good discussion, some of which I'm not really qualified to take place in (I've only been in btc for about 6 months) they could use more knowledgeable people over there to clear up misconceptions.

There's the issue, I live in the US. The currency here works well enough for most people so even after explaining the benefits they see bitcoin as unnecessary right now. Of course when the US has to default on the debt and the dollar goes to shit, then they'll understand. All this kind of reminds me of the movie The Big Short.

I'll leave this up and send .01btc to whichever sounds the best by the end if the day. This is pretty good but I'd like it to be a bit more professional and not scare them off with phrases like magic internet money(I personally like it though)
Anyway let's hope they take our advice!
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:16:32
Coinbase has an instant buy option up to $200 (I think) with a debit card, DON'T use coinbase if you're buying anything 'not quite legal' though, they will track your purchase and you could end up with unexpected guests knocking on your door.

@_date: 2016-12-30 16:28:29
I'm just confused, you're implying that everyones bitcoin is going to be taken away but that's what proper storage practices are for. And really it does work pretty well for what its for, and getting better all the time.

Yup that's why I'm supporting businesses who accept bitcoin, talking to people about it etc. This is what we need to do, not hodl and never talk to anyone about it, that won't get us anywhere. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 23:46:11
Depends on how USD does in the coming years and if the public actually buys into it. Possible to exceed golds market cap, unlikely, but possible.

Usually takes at least 4 businesses days before the money shows up. That's Coinbase though, easy but expect to wait a lot.
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:55:52
Yeah when buying it's said the coin will be in the wallet in 3-4 business days but it really took like 7. It's common with them but of that's the only issue you're having with them consider yourself lucky.
