I’m asking if I buy btc right now and buy the alts I’m looking st now will I lose money if btc drops low after or before the fork?
As in if I sell my BTC and am holding 100% alts, will go negative if btc lowers in price? Isn’t my amount worth just on the price of the alt?
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:13:58
Coinbase has a minimum day requirement for certain amounts right? How long is authorization usually? Isn’t it like 30 days
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:02:12
I know I️ meant not anymore 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:11:14
I don’t think you understand. I’m not buying btc for btc I’m buying btc to buy alts, preferably tonight to collect these discount coins before the alts pop 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:29:57
You see I’m trying to buy a... decent size before tonight so it’s kind of relevant to me at least. 
And how quick is quick?

@_date: 2018-03-29 15:59:26
Cause it’s the only one mainstream people know lmfao I swear the media is so ignorant
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:43:37
That’s because people who know nothing and watch NBC Business with the dumbasses who don’t know shit about crypto think they are geniuses on the topic

I actually was providing what you can call online services (specifically towards social media and account growing as I also ran and still run a large social media account) and received payments in BTC for building accounts for people, among other things. Funny enough on this online forum I frequent, I found a thread of me trash talking BTC when I was a noob at $310. I mean, could you blame me? I was literally 13. I didn’t really know much, just that many people used it as a payment back then. 
Now people only receive money on this forum via ETH or BTC. 
And no, I did not hold lmao. i truly cry myself to sleep everyday. /s. If i would have just held 1 Btc at $300 i could have a good $6-6.25k. If I would have convinced somehow my dad to throw in 3k it would currently be 60k in USD fiat but hey, live and learn. Crypto is still very young and A LOT of money to be made in the coming 5-10 years.

Yup, I say $7k easily with next fork rally
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:49:03
I hope you know before China Fud we were 4.6-4.9k.  hype for the fork got it 6k+, when it’s done it’ll go back and correct to 5-5.2k I’ll say. So he just lost money that easily.

The whole image or logo had to be moved down. It’s way too high on the chest

Definitely ,  it’s amazing, if you’re ever in Times Square go to Guantanamera (Cuban cuisine)
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:51:59
Not for another 5-10 years. The market is way too new and early to have a major die out
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:29:51
No he’s talking about ROI in Fiat currency, not SAT value
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:27:07
Buy alts. After today the alt market will flourish and be back to normal as people will sellout their btc for alts 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:52:09
This. It’s literally $50k on the line, the cost of $200-1k is worth it 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:08:00
Funny... I’m 16 right now, held my first BTC at late 13 early 14 back at 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:36:13
Especially to thousands a day in Times Square and nasdaq backing it 
I actually was walking and heard a guy explaining to his girlfriend how BTC prices are rising so fast.. I was going to ask him how much he knows but ehh
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:31:53
dumb decision you bought high
