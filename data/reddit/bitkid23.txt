Listen up, I kinda like Brian Armstrong. He seems genuine enough, if not a little too quick to speak sometimes. BUT... Don't be fooled, coinbase is now a slave to all the VCs it took far too much money from. Oh, and guess what, they now all want a return on their investments. Hence coinbase adding Ethereum, hiking prices etc. They'll be more to follow...
Poor old Brian is caught between a rock and hard place. His original vision is crumbling before his eyes and he's now on the back foot. I don't blame him. He got caught up in the hysteria like so many of us. We thought btc would go 'mainstream' much faster. 
And all the talk of "Security" and  "compliance"? Spare us the smoke screen.
1. I don't care about security too much - people should instantly move btc to their own wallet. Isn't that one of the main points of btc ?!!
2. Coinbase had the same compliance requirements as banks, money transmitters etc. Don't enter the game without reading the rules.

So some guy has an opinion on the price of bitcoin. Big deal. It’s an OPINION!! Is that not allowed any more? Get a life you gimps. Better still, get a wife. Then you might have something better to do on a Saturday night.

"We are fully rebuilding our systems from the ground up" and now they says it is being done in 48 hours? Errr, they are either very fast workers or its not a full rebuild. This is getting more bizarre by the day.

Golden rule regarding PR/Comms in this situation is if you have good news (i.e they can prove their cold storage coins are safe) then release and substantiate the 'good' news to counteract the bad news (hot wallet hack). The fact this isn't being done is very odd...

I had a similar issue. Still waiting for a reply...
In the meantime I've opened an account with another exchange as well which went very smoothly. Appreciate this doesn't help you get you money back though !

Don't CoinWallet realise that this 'stress test is:
a) making bitcoin look foolish in its formative years
b) making people hate CoinWallet
Come on guys, this really has to be the worst marketing campaign of all time. 
There are a lot of companies trying to establish genuine businesses in this sector and trying to educate the consumer about the benefits of bitcoin. CoinWallet's actions, what ever the misguided intention, really aren't helping anyone.

Love it - Bitcoin Brenda is rocking the tube! We’ll see mass adoption in her life time.

There once was a thing called blockchain,
That was invented by a man with a large brain,
We’re not quite sure of his identity, 
But to suggest it’s an Aussie is an obscenity!
So, Mr Wright, it’s time to shut up a refrain.
