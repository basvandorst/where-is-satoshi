This is great! Thanks for the recommendation.

I think they're referring to the community itself and the tendency to easily turn-off newcomers to the crypto. It's all serious business on this sub and doesn't leave much room for community growth.

And r/dogecoin is growing at 1,000+ per DAY. What's the point? It's not about numbers anyways..it's what each subreddit is doing to improve their currency; whether that's r/bitcoin positioning themselves as a viable currency or r/dogecoin just working to gain exposure and recognition.

Kind of reminds me of one of my favorite pianists, Ludovico Einaudi. Great work!
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:14:23
Yep. Saw him listed as a similar artist and checked him out. :)
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:18:25
Ohhh yeah. Already familiar with him. Gymnopedie is amazing and consistently puts me in a dreamlike state when I have headphones on.

I would give up a few of my bitcoins for that! Bitcoin for world peace haha.

This is awesome! Can't wait for the Android version.

It's too late. I already laughed. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:58:55
I love seeing legitimate business entities use Reddit. I'll read their comment, nod at their professionalism and helpfulness, and then look at their username and many times, laugh.

See the other commenters suggestion. It's super easy to see deleted posts. I'm telling you to stop being a dick because instead of giving an objective explanation for why your approach on the block size debate is better suited, you just say something along the lines of "don't listen to him, he's wrong!" It has nothing to do with anyone being new, it's just how productive arguments work. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:44:46
Got it. Hopefully there will be some way to determine activity. Just have to stay tuned, I suppose.

Selling during or after a crash..whichever it is, this chart tells me I should hold out.
Why wouldn't it continue to rise?
@_date: 2017-01-05 11:31:19
Yep, basically the same amount of time. Depends if there's a lot of trades or wallet moves going on, but usually it'll take somewhere in the 2-5 minutes range for the transaction to be confirmed.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:28:44
You're safe. This is just about exchanges (ie. places you buy bitcoin from). Yours are on a wallet in which you have the keys, or basically full control over them.
@_date: 2017-01-07 06:04:56
Well, with a message like yours, he's done more for the conversation than you have. Don't be a dick.
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:34:53
Thank you for the clarification. Would there still be some sort of graph or reporting on how many transactions are done per day or month? My confidence in the linked graph comes because it shows increased awareness and popularity and that btc is being used more and more.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:29:12
Yep. Just go to the send section of your profile and enter the address of the wallet you want to send to.

I remember hearing about the 95% acceptance rate needed. Last I saw, things were stalled ~25%. Even so, if it doesn't pass, the issue is definitely at the forefront of discussion and solutions from both sides of the table are being discussed. I'm confident a mutual solution can be found in the not too distant future.
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:43:51
Why aren't you allowed to tell more? Aren't alternative opinions in discussions conducive to solutions?
The fact that the issue is being addressed gives me up. The solutions may be at very different sides at the moment, but I believe that overtime, both sides will move towards the center out of necessity. People believe in and want the same thing, it's just a matter of figuring out the mutual road to get there.
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:19:01
I can't say that I'm super familiar with the technical aspects of the blocksize issue, but aren't things like SegWit and the Lightning Network meant to solve just that?
edit: Happy cakeday, btw :)

I think you should do a bit of research into what bitcoin is first, like you would do with any other investment.
@_date: 2016-12-22 20:35:27
Translation: Good fucking luck.

Make America great again, Walmart! Rollin' back prices for the middle-class and underprivileged!!
@_date: 2016-02-23 14:55:18
But...but....Bitcoin is dead?! /s
@_date: 2016-07-28 18:53:17
This changes everything! Phew, glad you corrected that for us.
