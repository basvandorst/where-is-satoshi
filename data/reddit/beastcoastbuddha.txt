Dude tried getting someone murdered on record and literally got caught when the policia raided a PUBLIC LIBRARY...
This guy was using his private email and logs in a public library. No shit they caught you. Sigh.

No I am sympathetic. I am by no means in support of his sentence. I hope he is freed one day. He should be. Just kinda waa dumb.

Forgot about this one too. DEX. Like WAVES Dex. Best one imo

Who decided on the URL is the real question?
Sounds like one of those MMORPG currency service websites ��

No you cant use coinbase for that. 
Its hard to find a exchange that is non KYC (know your customer) which might let it slip by the bank...
But localbitcoins is the go to. Honestly i dont even like paying tax on it so I use LocalMonero, buy XMR with cash via mail..I pay a slightly higher rate but its worth it..move monero to a exchange and boom can just swap for BTC. Lots of options to leave bank out. 
Regardless you keep a escrow on localbitcoins and you can move it wherever. All depends

That's a sign from your guardian angel. Spend a tad bit extra and buy it with cash or at least on a DEX 
Do yourself a favor. They give out 1099s over $20 now. True story ��
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:04:00
What if I told you they already do?

@_date: 2019-05-13 04:46:31
The sad thing is its 2019 and the headline could be a number anywhere from $0-?????????? and none of us really have any idea ��
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:13:39
Id go with same site ^^ 
Used them to do same. Not a issue
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:44:25
LocalMonero is still kickin. No KYC
Seriously tho. This should be upvoted 200 times. XMR will eventually be what bitcoin will eventually be, just for the black markets. Plus you can bet your ass if the government ever manages to control bitcoin centuries from now, you'll be glad you put some away for ya kids and kids kids.

Tax fraud? Because I advised he buy BTC with cash or use a DEX? Clearly just ways to avoid a bank stopping a purchase 
And yes I mentioned companies sending 1099s for $20, dont be such a redcoat
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:26:27
You would think the government would hire better more convincing people huh
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:46:08
Agreed. I'm cooking steaks at work and nobody has even ordered one yet
