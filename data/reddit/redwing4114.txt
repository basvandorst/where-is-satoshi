That sounds right. Its easy to think it is the same until you visit other places.

I was born there, living in Canada now, thank god.. In Singapore it is essentially under a good dictator, still... a dictatorship. It is exactly like every other legal system I would imagine except the rules and laws are severely strict. Few of the t.v shows are shockingly similar to North Korean brainwashing.. no I am not kidding.. That is to give a view of what type of society it is, although the people are probably the nicest people similar to Cuba. 
I don't know if it is a still enforced, if you do something that would be a fine in North America, it might require lashings by a whip. A famous case is of a expats son spray painting cars, the father written in to either the president of America or a high official trying to reverse the sentence to whipping. He received less whippings.

In Singapore that sounds about right. Anything that is medium level drug offence is death..

Xapo works too. There is a 3% fee and also other fees too for withdrawl I think and for the card itself. There are a few countries the card does not ship to.

I love that scene. It also has the most underated comedian, patrice oneal playing the part, making it that much better.
I was thinking to write the wallet words down and leave out the last 3 words. Use those last three words as 3 seperate accounts on trezor. The phrases minus the last 3 if it is possible I want to open up one account with those words, so anyone that looks at the paper phrases will think that those are the phrases, when they open up the wallet it will look like the main account. But if they try to retrieve it, it will not go through, unless it will take hold of that sub account.
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:05:05
Interesting. I think the number one thing I would look for is if I can save my phrases to their online vault that is unhackable if that is possible. It would be difficult to find a place to put your phrases written down, other than a bank safe, as home safes are easily stolen and if you throw a party you would be worried about people rummaging through your stuff. 
Thats a really neat feature. 
So I can have a password: paper and when I type it in that wallet is revealed? I can also type in password: yellow and another one will open? I can imagine myself forgetting a few... when I create too many.. trezor can restore it with the phrases?

Is there a way to store your backup words online in their online vault of sorts? If I can lose my wallet I can definately lose my backup words, especially if I was to get robbed by someone that knows enough about btc. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 02:28:16
Coinkite btc usb? 
I am talking about a Card that you can purchase items directly using bitcoin in store. It goes through the card company that pays in advance for you instead of waiting for btc transactions in store.
The end goal would be in my opinion a way to safely store btc in a wallet and be able to retrieve your wallet words from a physical vault but has to still be anonymous.  
@_date: 2016-06-11 18:10:40
How long until someone creates a card that can be used like a debit card (instant) and have your bitcoins stored in an off line vault? 
Transaction of bitcoin are instant but you have to wait for 30-40 minutes for it to go through. The card can pay in advance once the transaction of btc starts? 
I would think this can eliminate the banking system once someone creates an ecosystem that is secure, where your money and btc is safe. Although it does defeat the purpose of anonymous spending. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:41:14
right. So you are stupid..
@_date: 2016-06-10 18:33:09
Only tiny thing I am concerned about, taxes.. If I link up my ID I get a larger withdrawl, which I need. However why do they need my ID? and if they plan to alert the IRS then they may make me pay taxes if I withdraw several thousand.. With an ATM unless they need ID it looks to be anonymous. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 19:56:38
Why would you have two coins?
You bought one coin at 800 sold at 590. You still have one coin + $-210. Unless you are recommending buying low and selling slightly higher and repeating that could work. You are not clear in what you are implying . Literally no one but you understands what you are saying or you are trolling. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:17:22
It could have something to do with the regulations that they have to follow. Give them the verification ID and you should be good to go.

That is true. I am in the process of learning it now by this thread. Once I get to about 70 percent of what I need to know I do the remaining 30 percent myself. The back and forth communication for a few minutes really cuts through an hour or 2 of research. Beautiful thing about reddit is everyone has a little piece of information on the topic, when everyone contributes you learn a lot in such a small time span. Then you contribute to someone else with the knowledge someone gave you.
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:32:43
using that knowledge. if they can find out on the block chain that a transaction reaches my wallet. Are they able to trace my location within 10miles?
If bitcoins are moved to my wallet and they can track that btc hit my wallet when I withdrawl to the banking system can they track at which bank location I did it at? Does block chain show this? 
Even if the answer is yes they can find out. I would just have two wallets, one with 10% of my funds the other 90%, kinda like if you get mugged you always keep two wallets, a decoy wallet with enough not to get you shot for being so broke. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 16:39:57
Do you own a card? How are atm withdrawls? I would like to know if the transactions are pain free like a standard card. The security seems to be there because of the vault and pin. 
 Luckily in Canada there are USD atm machines everywhere. I can always hold USD in my bank and exchange to cad as the currency changes. 
It looks like the prices for coinbase and Xapo are about the same. I may give them a try.
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:26:52
There are a few OTC that happen online by people that trade only in btc. They run a business trading so they do have some trust in their work. 
With person to person im not that keen on doing a large amount like 20k or more in a police station... but maybe a bank. For all I know a person could get one of his buddies to rob you and the guy you were trading with has no ties to the crime. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:21:37
Anyone know if it is possible I can get my physical wallet hacked by having it linked to multibit for example and someone getting onto my trezor. I assume there are safety features that prevent this. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:49:15
Are you Canadian? If you are what are your thoughts on the btc atms here? I think I might go that route since I can get a lot of it out through that method and it is anonymous. The canadian banks ask questions if you deposit too much..  What is kyc/aml and how does that effect me?
I may go gemini route too thanks for the link, first hearing about it. Does it work like coinbase? you buy from their exchange, sell to their exchange and keep a usd account and btc account with them and withdraw to your bank? It still is a bit more than btc atm because the government will tax you... If I buy a car with that money and resell it I dont pay any taxes on it if I remember correctly. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:23:28
But god forbid your place gets the fire department called on it, nothing can be done. Probably the safest is not online, but a safety deposit box.
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:32:17
It would be useful to save your wallet back up phrases short of 3 words online and have your three phrases be wallets on your trezor, that way you will use those phrases enough it will be set in your memory and can recover your wallet easily.

You have to sell all your coins at 800. 
If you bought at 800 and sold at 590 you better make sure btc is at 800 in the future
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:19:00
Is there a way anyone can use that bitcoin address even if it is new to somehow get to your physical wallet. I know the odds are low but if there is any theoretical way for them to use it against you or track down your location. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:24:41
I will look into it. 
Would you use a paper wallet too? I hear something about them being offline and maybe the trezor is not offline? 
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:43:01


These are your words. Buy at 800. and sell at 590.. lol. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 10:59:35
If I rememeber correctly it is 50 deposit, 50 withdrawl.
@_date: 2016-06-24 02:58:49


when you say (and do that multiply) what does that mean and how did you get the end results being profitable? You never said anything about determining the price of bitcoin. Lots of things you didn't include, which will be the ruin to your idea. 
Everything you say is in a riddle. No one understands exactly what your point is, of course you know what your point is but if you can't convey it properly people will write it off. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:57:07
Really? a virus on a computer cant infect the trezor? Just so I can read more about it what is the security that allows for this?

Coinbase is easy to use for small amounts. If I need to move stored up BTC worth 50-100k I want to do it all at once (OTC), because coinbase will most likely ban my account for suspicious activity. I dont like to gamble on the fluctuation of BTC. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 00:33:37


Why would you assume that? Your reasoning skills are a bit off and you are douchey. I dont trade bitcoin I am using it as a form of currency. A currency that is new and different than most currencies without the same infrastructure as fiat and not as widely accepted. 
 I ask for information from others that are knowledgeable in the subject because I am not familiar with coinbase and how their company is changing. As far as I know the company still sells and buys btc. But there is something about ethereum, that concerns me as they may for some reason deal only in ethereum and discontinue being a btc exchange.

Thats a shame really. At least have the faces show emotion, like a collection of art piece centered around an emotion. A lot of people go to art school, then listen to all that artsy shitty advice and create mediocre art. If your art has no substance, at least your anger for not making it should comeout in your brush strokes. I think most painters become famous in their later years. 
 David choe has really good art though.

Gambling earnings. Everything will be recorded for the revenue agency to collect. Although they may assume it is from another illegal source even if I provide evidence, as some will be wary of where so much bitcoin is coming from. I suppose with the evidence of withdrawl from online sportsbooks it should be treated like fiat even though it is in btc. 
 I would preferrably like to move currency through wire transfer because I do not know of any exchanges that moves bitcoin to fiat that are reliable and known to handle large transactions like that. Canadian banks I believe sometimes dont even accept incoming wire transfers from sportsbooks so I dont want to not be able to move the cash into my bank.

You are suppose to increase your price. Art is like wine, the more expensive the better.
OP says he is a fail painter so sell your work at 5k,10k,20k a piece, since you arent making any cash anyways. To be honest I have made paintings like that in HS. If your nude style isnt going anywhere draw something else, experiment with darker colours, learn to paint with different colours and have them look visually appealing. Express your anger with your failure as a painter in your paintings, and try doing so with less colour, art is about expression. I just see naked people w/ no narrative, there is no emotion in your paintings, at all.
