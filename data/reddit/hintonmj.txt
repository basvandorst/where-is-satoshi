I'm much more in the "store of value" camp. I definitely think it's unlikely Bitcoin would be *the* currency for everyone. Why do retirees ever cash in their stocks? They're likely to be worth more tomorrow. It's an economic loss to them to ever sell them.  People will use Bitcoin for the same reason they use other appreciating assets. There's something they need/want now that has more value to them than holding on to a fraction of a fraction of their wealth.

You HODL *right now* for the chance it becomes a useful currency/store of value in the future. 
You HODL for the chance you're not left behind in case Crypto becomes one of the (if not the) only game in town.
You only invest an amount you'd be comfortable losing. You only put in enough that if crypto goes to zero you go ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "Oh well, I tried, I was wrong. No biggy."
It doesn't really matter what you "tie" it to. For instance, you can tie it to gold or anything *right now* by converting from fiat money. Fiat money is used because that's the easiest method of trading. Much more difficult to buy bitcoin digitally with physical gold (or even securities that represent gold).
The problem with number 3 is just because a government or anyone creates new crypto it doesn't mean it's going to affect the market in any large way. People have to be willing to adopt it, willing to trust it. It's hard to develop trust in new crypto long term. 
The reason Bitcoin is probably the least risky bet is because it has the most history, the most trust. That could change eventually, but it's where we are now.

6 months - 3 years?

There is really strong support at 6K. I'd love it to go down that far, but I'm not holding my breath.

Heads up for all the "Tulip Mania" analogies, it's a myth.

Instead of dropping large quantities, I buy small amounts everyday.

"Support" doesn't mean it never drops a dollar bellow it. It means around that level there's a lot of people who are buyers. In order to break support it needs to drop significantly below that level for an extended period of time. It's touched $5800 several times already.
None of this means support will hold in the long run, but the support exists.

I'm still scared I won't be able to buy enough before it starts the next run. Since the bubble popped, I've been dollar cost averaging in a little everyday. If it goes any lower, I'll probably increase my buy rate. I've said since it started crashing that I hope it gets back down to $1000 (around when I started buying) so I could "buy a couple." I'm anxious about how little I have right now.
Reading comments on here makes it seem like a bunch of people think it's going there and it would be stupid to buy even then because it's just going to go lower.
It's just a few thousand dollars. Either way it will give me a story to tell my grandkids.

I guess we'll see. Everyone is placing their bets right now. Either by buying, staying on the sidelines, or selling/shorting. I don't really care if I'm wrong. I can afford to lose a couple thousand dollars.
But I wouldn't be so sure that Bitcoin has no "intrinsic value." To give my take I'll repost a comment I made on another site:

But but... I'm still acquiring... we're not allowed to moon yet!
