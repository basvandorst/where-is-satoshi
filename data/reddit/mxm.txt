Chineese, trying to get money out of their country + Second market are the main reasons, i think.
I also think it's because a lot of btc-holders do not want to sell their bitcoins, as they think the price would go much higher.  But the demand is rising. So an important factor is at which price is the majority going to cash out(if the majority is ever going to).

@_date: 2013-11-07 03:43:19
My thoughts:
1)The transaction volume does not matter so much. Supply and demand are more important. If everyone is holding and keeps on holding, and only spends coins to buy stuff and not $, the price will rise because there are a lot of people buying in and the supply is low(stays low when the newcomers decide do hold).   
2)The transaction volume is measured in bitcoins. Even if stays the same, but the price rises, there is more value going through  the network. 
3)You are the perfect example for why this is not a manipulation bubble. There are a lot of people getting interested in bitcoins.
4)Dont trust me to much. I am an overly optimistic person.

I do not think that the advantage of gold/silver was its ability to be produced. It was just accepted everywhere. You did not need to trust any authority to accept it. Some African tribe kings but also the Mongolians knew that gold is rare and limited. There were also times where gold WAS deflational.
Imo it is not really a point with the 3000 years. The economy/money system as it is known now is something different and new. One did not see a lot of people investing before 1700.
 I also do not think that gold/silver prices are the stabilizing factor in the modern world economy, it is just another good(i know, a lot of currencies are backed by gold.). It could also be manipulated, just not as easy because of the giant market cap.

Price depends on demand and supply. It increases because a lot of people would like to buy coins. It drops when there are more coins being offered for sale than people willing to buy them.
China telecom accepting bitcoins means, that some of the people owning bitcoins in china will maybe pay with bitcoins for their communication services. This would enlarge the usage of bitcoins which increases demand, which increases the price. 
All this is just theory. There are not a lot of people holding bitcoins and i doubt new people will start buying coins just to pay with them. It is a good thing thou, as it shows a sign of acceptance.

Bitcoin is not a traditional currency, it starts from another point.


Because you want to buy something now and not tomorrow or the day after.
 If you want the bitcoin to succeed, you spend it and buy the same amount from an exchange. So you don't loose your investment amount and help spread the currency.

If you look down on the volume chart and move your mouse along the graph, you can see how much coins it takes to bring the price down or up to some point. The Graph shows the buy and sell orders of people, who are willing to pay/get by selling the corresponding price. If somone wants to sell a lot of coins, he fulfills the orders to some point where he is out of coins. Someone sold 2000 coins which made the price drop, after that some people got nervous and started to sell/buy and some tried to use this drop for "day-trading".
