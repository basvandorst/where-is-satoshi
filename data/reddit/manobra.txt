As a developer, i have to say: STAY AWAY from programs/miners/etc... That someone just linked to you.
Prefer open source solutions.
I can make a trojan to collect a wallet as Well as the passwords. If u send to virustotal it Will say "no infections".
If installed under admin rights, I can create firewall rules (or even disable it).

Lol! In my last visit to dentist (3 days ago), I told him about Bitcoin, but rather than explain, I told him to Google it....
Yesterday, He called me to scheddule next visit...
Before saying "good by", He said:
"Hey! I gloogled Bitcoin and want to talk to you about it ok?!"
 
He appeared to understood The concept, and wants to start accepting Bitcoins...
Today is my birthday!! 19/01!! Eeeeeee!!!

Well... In a universe that we advise everybody to STAY AWAY from EXEs that someone just linked....
Sorry, but without The sources, I'll follow the advices...
PS: run it under VM/Virtual box/etc in order to watch its behavior is useless.

If I understood, the OP may have many wallet.dat files and have no clue where the address he has comes from.
