Same here. It's straightforward and looks nice (in my opinion, anyway)

I think I found my new favorite bot!

Thank you!

How transparent is Circle?
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:16:26
Interesting, thank you. I don't keep any Bitcoin on any websites, but I do use Circle to buy.

circle.com is confirmed to be legitimate, right?

Coinbase tried to do a deposit, but I got a message from my bank saying:
"We cannot process your transfer dated 04/03/2015.
From Account:xyz
To Account:zyx 
Amount: $.01"

Oh well, my Circle account is verified, so I don't need Coinbase anymore. Thanks for the advice, though!

I am updating to Chrome Version 41.0.2272.101 m now, I believe.
Edit: It was an update, not my current version.

Coinbase wouldn't do an instant, so I'm doing the deposit method. It'll take a few days, and it'll send me a reminder email, which is good, since I'll forget about the site by then lol

Circle.com says I'm on an unsupported browser, even though I'm not, And that was my favorite from the three...
