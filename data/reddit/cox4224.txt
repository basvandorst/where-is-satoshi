Yep, past tense just means you didn't hodl.

Exactly. Where Bitcoin fits in is certainly the question. Competing crypto currencies is a good thing toward realizing that future...but you are right that failed startups should be expected.

This is only one of the many features that create the true value of Bitcoin. That doesn't mean smart improvements in processing transaction volume are not welcome, but don't forget that in minutes a Bitcoin transaction can be completely settled and verified. We all want it faster, but that's still pretty amazing!

People thought the internet would fail because it would never be able to handle 'all' the faxes.
Today, I streamed Netflix while driving across country to visit my family for the holidays. That's the power of exponential curves. It doesn't mean we shouldn't push for speed, but people need to calm down.

Hah. My girlfriend was driving, but yes kids don't stream movies or trade crypto while driving.

Coinbase is "custodial Bitcoin". Don't confuse their fees with true Bitcoin.

I just got chills watching a guy buy coffee. The sheer potential of such a simple thing is amazing.

Yes. It's not a violation of natural laws. In fact it preserves natural rights remarkably well (the pursuit of life, liberty, and property). Slavery was legal at one point according to human legislation, but never according to the laws of nature.

Really quick. There is only tax implications if you shift from long-term capital gains to short-term gains with higher tax rates (which you noted correctly). I just don't want to confuse people, it is possible to follow the strategy here and immediately re-buy each time you sell without any change in tax burden whatsoever.

It feels like you do, but you actually don't. Again, unless you shift from long-term to short-term but that should be uncommon in this Hodl but spend scenario where you generally hold your bitcoin but buy some stuff on the side to support the protocol. Let's do a scenario, I buy $1000 worth of Bitcoin more than a year ago and today that is worth $10k (yay!).
Tonight I buy a sweet widget for $200 in Bitcoin from a local widget shop, I technically owe $27 in long-term gains ($200 price - $20 cost basis = $180, and $180 * 15% capital gains = $27). I immediately re-buy $200 in Bitcoin bringing me back to $10k amount I had before the widget.
I HODL for another year... and my bitcoin is now worth $40k (to the MOON!). I decide to sell because I am a pansy in this scenario and can't hodl any longer (boo). If I would have never sold/re-purchased I would owe **$5850** in taxes ($40k price - $1k cost = $39k profit * 15%). In the widget scenario I would owe $5823 ($40k cost - $1180 adjusted cost * 15% = $5823). When you add the original $27 in tax paid when I bought the widget, you get back to the exact same **5850**.

Well, this is why we push for segwit and now lightning. Some people only care about the price, but others want to push the technology.
When speculation caused massive buying, the tech improved because we had to learn to scale (beyond just the silly notion of bigger blocks).
I'm a long term hodler, but that doesn't mean I can't continue to buy and use what you call  "funny money".

Man, at 6:00 watching how fast it shows up in Coinbase account. Made my girlfriend watch this, she has no idea what the hell I'm so excited about. This can change the world!
