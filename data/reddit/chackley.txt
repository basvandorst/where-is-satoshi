Did you pay him the .5 BTC?  Because if not I'd be willing to explain it to you to make some quick coin.

Ah, that would be the perfect backdrop for the wailing cacophany, wouldn't it?

Your wish is my command:  
To turn on screams, click the "Panic Mode" checkbox.  I honestly don't think this is worth including in the actual codebase (it's painful to listen to), which is why I hosted it separately.  But if people feel that merging it would be appropriate, then I'll go ahead and submit a pull request.

Is your implementation parallelized?  I sure hope you're taking advantage of all those cores.  I don't have an accurate timer in mine, but just from eyeballing it, it looks like I'm doing either 3/second or 6/second.  For reference, my CPU is probably a good bit slower than yours (it's [an aging 4-core 3.0Ghz AMD model]( and I'm running on 3 cores.  So, if I was single-threaded, I'd probably be achieving 1-2 / second.  If I had your hexacore CPU, I bet I could do anywhere from 6-12/second.  Maybe more, if your processor is *a lot* faster than mine, which it may be.

I think it's had a lot of the same vibe as a [Yahoo Finance message board](  Which makes sense - there are people who want bitcoin to rise, and people who want it to fall.  It's in their best interest to convince other people to buy or sell, and move the price the way they want it.  I hope everyone realizes that, when people have money at stake in something like this, you shouldn't take one word out of their mouths at face value.

Hmm...[the balance]( doesn't appear to have changed yet.

The main reason I cross-posted this to /PF is that I knew that there would be people there who would be able to articulate good, sound financial advice far better than I am capable of.  I hope OP will heed some of the advice people there have to give.  
I would also like to ward off people who think I'm attacking Bitcoin - I'm not!  I'm a pretty big fan of Bitcoin; the whole reason I saw this post is because I'm subscribed to the sub.

Can you provide SSH access (presumably under a strictly limited user account)?  I have a simple parallelized implementation written in Java, and I'd love to take advantage of all of those cores (right now I'm only running on 3 CPUs, and it looks like it's going to be another 8-12 hours before I've finished scanning a set comprised only of all characters [a-zA-Z]).

Okay, I've got a parallelized brute-force Java implementation running on my quad-core desktop currently.  Even in parallel, it's pretty slow.  We'll see.  If [the extra ~0.9 BTC]( comes through, maybe I'll consider renting a [32-core EC2 box]( for a while...
EDIT:  Judging from my current rates, I'd make a very rough estimate that it will take me between 8-16 hours to check all possible 3-character strings composed of the set [a-zA-Z].  So, I should know by tonight/tomorrow whether the password is composed of only letters, or whether I need to expand the search set to include numbers and other special characters.  This is all assuming my implementation is bug-free, which is a very dangerous assumption in itself.
EDIT 2:  Just a thought.  I suspect that on a 32-core box, I could search the characters-only set in about 1.5 hours.  I could rent access to such a box through Amazon for $2.40/hour, so it'd cost $4.80 to perform this search very quickly.  Of course, if the password contains non-alpha characters (which it very likely does, as the whole point of this post is to inform us about BIP38), then the search set becomes *much* wider.

I think your friend may have been confused - [Amazon promises a certain number of ECUs (an arbitrary metric of CPU clock speed defined by them) for each instance class](  My company hosts all of our compute-intensive bioinformatics applications on EC2.  The only thing I can think of to explain your friend's phenomenon is if s/he was using [a t1.micro class instance]( - instances in that class are throttled by design - they are occasionally allowed to have short spikes of high CPU utilization, and so their intended usage is for applications which only see occasional spikes in activity (a lot of small blogs and websites are like this).  But if you tried to use one of those for a compute-heavy task like rainbow tables (which would be completely inappropriate for an instance of that type, as per the documentation), then yes, it would look like you were being throttled.  
EDIT:  There's a nice definition of an ECU [on Wikipedia](

As the person who cross-posted, I'm wondering what "misconceptions" you're referring to.  Personally, I'm a fan of Bitcoin, and a subscriber to r/bitcoin, and I've been very impressed with the amount of people in r/personalfinance who are willing to have a serious discussion about bitcoin.  That wasn't really the point of my post, of course, but it's an inevitable consequence when people hear about something strange and new.
It does appear that the odd few r/bitcoin members are giving the rest of us a bad name, coming across as overly hostile and defensive to the r/personalfinance members of the discussion.  One person told me something along the lines of "r/bitcoin people came and gave me a ton of downvotes".  The person in question was asking very reasonable, polite questions, so let's try not to get hostile and defensive too quickly, people.  If we want people to take bitcoin seriously, we need to be able to enter into civil, polite discussions with them about why they should!
