@_date: 2018-09-27 20:12:35
Nothing there at all in reference.
@_date: 2018-09-24 16:14:59

Thats IF they pass on the savings.
Hasn't happened anywhere ever.

Shouldn't the utility company be prohibited from entering the bitcoin arena then?
@_date: 2018-08-27 18:22:50
You've never been rich.
Its never a 'need' to have more.
@_date: 2018-08-27 19:07:47
Need that untraceable currency. For....reasons.
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:47:36
Ill wait until a power person in power says that. Oh wait...

This argument really only works for countries that have nothing else of value.
@_date: 2018-10-24 18:17:08
English and bad english count.
@_date: 2018-10-31 15:47:04
Too bad they're one of the many countries that have nothing of value.
