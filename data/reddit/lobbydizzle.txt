I had a $17 fee last week. Where do I get my Verbucks?
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:27:31
For being meanies!

There are lots of dumb people in the world who are either lucky or have had money handed to them from family.

I incurred a $17 fee last week.

As a holder. I don't find it as successful anymore. I remember back when there was hype around adoption and being able to use it for everyday transactions (though I did just buy a rug from Overstock with it recently). Nowadays we ignore the fact that it's just a store of value.
@_date: 2019-07-10 05:55:38
I'm pretty layman, but I think that's the plan, or is it already in place? I didn't use it to buy the rug.
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:02:22
Nah, I think they should invest and spend elsewhere if losing $100 would ruin their life.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:57:19
Do you know how to use the command line? If you have a Mac (or a PC with a unix shell) you can essentially search all files for a pattern that matches a bitcoin key. If you haven't tried this yet feel free to PM me with what computer OS you have and I can try to help.
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:25:03
Ohh, I read CNN at first, too :|
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:41:32
If losing $100 causes one to be suicidal, maybe they should spend/invest it elsewhere...
@_date: 2018-09-16 10:00:29
There are lots of uncharted areas out there. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 20:05:23
Is it still traceable if one uses a coin tumbler?
@_date: 2014-11-17 03:08:57
But if all else fails I can pay with cash or the could even use one of those old fashioned mechanical card readers.

The cinnamon tequila milkshake is amazing.

Going against the grain here, but I feel that Bitcoin, like USD, has no backing other than the value we put on it. 
Gold on the other hand, doesn't need backing, because it's gold and has its own value.
Edit: my second point is invalid, but I stick by my opinion that Bitcoin is more like USD than gold.

Oh damn I didn't know Thomas Foolery accepted. Bitcoin! BTW, he also owns Mr. Yogato and a Tesla S :)

For some reason people like to link twitter links here instead of the relevant pieces. Here's the deck that's linked in the tweet: 
@_date: 2016-01-19 06:00:23
As another layman, as long as it keeps working then why should I care?
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:18:49
So they're literally making a whole other cryptocurrency? If so, why care what they name it?
@_date: 2017-02-13 21:42:22
How do you think Bitcoin would ever get mass-adopted if its heaviest supporters call other supporters idiots if they don't 100% understand the technology behind it?
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:43:48
What's stopping them from doing this? I'm sick of all of this drama.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:13:14
I'm already invested in Bitcoin and am not investing any further. In that case, are my earnings safe?
@_date: 2016-01-19 05:59:14
What is the transaction rate?
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:55:31
That makes no sense. So the Bitcoin in my wallet is going to be "removed" from my wallet and replaced with a "counterfeit copy"?
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:36:00
Newb here. How will this separate me from my earnings?
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:40:59
I'm just trying to understand the state of things. So basically they're trying to create a new cryptocurrency and steal the Bitcoin name, but the Bitcoin we all know and love will technically still exist, as will our wallets?
I wasn't sure if they were trying to change the underlying code of Bitcoin itself.


That makes it more clear
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:42:07
By devaluing Bitcoin? Wouldn't this separate everyone from their earnings? 
@_date: 2017-01-08 17:17:18
I've never felt condescended on this sub, but often don't want to derail threads with questions like "what is the fork and why should I care?"
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:53:26
As a fellow noob who put a bit in earlier this year, just sign up for Coinbase and buy Bitcoin through there. You can specify the exact amount of cash to invest. It's not like stocks where you have to buy whole shares.
@_date: 2016-11-10 14:45:27
There are a few Bitcoin ATMs around me.
@_date: 2016-11-09 16:04:44
Hey, I live there.
@_date: 2016-11-09 16:06:23
Those are lot of steps just to replace the credit card in my wallet. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 20:38:59
Do you like Circle more than Coinbase? 
Also, where did that guy go who said he'd give everyone who comments 0.1 BTC if Trump won?! He deleted the post.
@_date: 2016-11-10 04:47:13
Ugh yeah I'm kicking myself admit ignoring my friends admit it years ago. And "It'll never go up much more than the current price", I'm telling myself now...
@_date: 2016-11-09 23:10:52
Ohhhhh, good point. I rescind my.previous statement. This would be about the same effort as opening up an investment account and selecting which markets to invest in.
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:18:11
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:29:05
And your wallet is insured by the FDIC :)
@_date: 2016-11-10 14:46:07
Does Breadwallet generate a wallet for me as well?
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:48:02
That's what I figured. I do know recall though they have some goofy tax regulations, like taxing the movement of coins as capital gains (I could be wrong though).
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:59:51
What's wrong with using Coinbase? Noob here who just wants to make an investment.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:36:31
Yes, some people on Earth are in their 20s.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:45:28
I do share that opinion. As a casual holder I don't feel like I have the technical chops to advise which fork is better, but at least doesn't ban people (that I know of) for having differing opinions.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:59:45
It was when we were starting to be able to use it as cash :/
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:45:33
Also that the guy plugged his company's chat site as where to give thanks for the pizza.
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:46:42
Let's focus on making it usable like a real currency.
@_date: 2017-04-14 05:17:46
Which forum are you talking about? btc or bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-04-17 01:49:51
Random question from a noob, but how do I configure minitip to withdrawal from my Bitcoin address? Do I need to first send btc to my minitip account?
@_date: 2017-04-14 04:51:24
Me too/either. It's fun sometimes, and annoying most other times (omg, look what this guy tweeted today!!!).
@_date: 2017-04-17 02:57:27
But how do I send tips?
@_date: 2017-04-17 03:12:35
Ohhh, nice! Thank you! Sorry, I should have read more in to the usage post (I glossed over the **deposit** command looking for an "account config" of sorts). Thank you for your patience and for this awesome platform!

To move in with them?
@_date: 2018-07-07 19:27:20
I know someone who’s been living off of their ether profits in SF for a bit over a year now. Sure, they need to convert it to fiat for rent and other USD expenses, but they’re still technically spending it rather than just holding.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:58:27
He even facilitated sales at first. He was literally the receiver and payer in every transaction. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:21:45
You can look up if there are any bitcoin atms close to you. I'm not sure what their fees are, though.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:39:56
And apparently fake emails were inserted in to the leaks with more damning yet fake evidence. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:39:23
How can our emails be real if our eyes aren't real?
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:57:29
AND horses.
@_date: 2016-07-27 03:42:12
And here I am, having no idea what this forking bs is all about. Should I just buy bitcoin and hold without bothering myself with all of this drama?
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:08:53
There won't be what?
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:40:55
What happens if I keep my coins on an exchange?
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:34:41
Does that asset class include all cryptos? They're all skyrocketing (at least Ethereum and Dogecoin are).
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:44:51
Why are you expecting it to crash?
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:40:35
How will services like Coinbase handle having two chains?
