To most people, Bitcoin is just another joke.

Transactions between 2 banks must be able to reverse, without this these 2 banks wouldn't do business at all.
For bank transactions, there are lots of problems happened everyday, if you can't trace and reverse a transaction, bank will be bankrupted for sure.

"Was used for about 4000 years by the free market." because 4000 years ago, government like gold and would like to collect it. Gold got government supported at that time.
The reason gold works is because gold has its value: at least gold looks beautiful, make gold ring, hard to find, not easy to break.
Bitcoin has nothing in itself at all. At least USD can be toilet paper or generate some heat by burning, Bitcoin can do nothing.

Learn what? it'll happen again without any doubt. You guys will get screwed soon or later, it's just a time issue.
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:08:37
Come on, can we just get some good news please?
Can you just move on, screwed just screwed, we have said many times. This is Bitcoin, do you understand?
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:23:05
No, just move on. Remember this is Bitcoin, whoever screwed it's your own fault, be smarter :)

I don't like fiat neither, I use to work in bank for long time, I know what is USD.
But Bitcoin is just a joke, it doesn't have some fundamental parts of a legit currency: it has to work for everybody, it must be able to reverse transaction in case some mistakes happen, also a currency need government to support, otherwise it's just a joke.

Hahahahahahahaha, I feel great. Scheme is just scheme, no scheme is sustainable, that's why we call it scheme. Bitcoin will get busted eventually, it's just a time issue.

How much brain do you have?

There's no unlimited newcomers, adoption rate will go down, check the current transaction volumn (dead in the water). Once you guys have less newcomers, the coins will be harder to sell, eventually price will drop to the ground, whatever you hold is just a void check, nothing at all.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:46:22
Of course you knew, come on, scheme is just scheme, it will always get busted. Once you guys run out the newcomers, the coins will be harder to sell, eventually price will drop to the ground.
A currency has to work for everybody in the world, not just you computer jerks.
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:31:44
I asked first, get smarter would you?
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:41:33
"That's a work in progress." What a joke, it will never work for most people before they die
"It's not the case for cash and I'm sure you use it pretty often." I use credit cards only, no cash at all, my wife takes some cash though.
"Absolutely not. A currency need to serve the free market, not the government." Absolutely lie, without a government, people will kill each other for food, there will be NO free market. Which currency in the world in use was not created by government, such a simple concept!

I'm sure we all will see how Bitcoin get busted, it wouldn't take too long.
