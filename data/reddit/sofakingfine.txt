Again  said it best. While yes it is taxed, the choice is still in your hands. A normal bank can freeze your assets at will. Civil asset forfeiture. You cannot seize what you do not control. And bitcoin is taking the power of money and giving it back to the people. Same example is used with the internet. The internet gave the power of information back to the people. It reduced the ability to spread propaganda because people can check 100s of sources and do their own vetting before believing.

That is the whole point behind bitcoin. It is yours and in no one else’s control assuming you hold your own keys.

Ive used in past but why pay the higher cost when they still do KYC, might as well buy from coinbase.

If you believe in and understand bitcoin then you know that someday it has potential to reach 6 figures and become a digital gold or new currency standard or whatever you believe it is here for. Take some profit sure, but selling all is just you gambling because it may never reach your lower levels resulting in you fomoing back in. Or the only reason you bought it was to make a profit and then you dont care what the price does after. Both theories result in you not believing in the technology meaning you dont understand bitcoin.
Edit: I should say i focus only on the ALL word because selling some means you pull your money out to reduce risk and if it goes down cause market wims great you buy more and when it continues back up you dont fomo cause you already have some and are having fun making more money.

The fact you sold ALL is the reason you dont understand bitcoin.
