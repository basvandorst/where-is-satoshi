Huuuum... no! :)
And even if I'm, it's just a hypothesis based on few facts observed here and there. Valid or no that's what I'm asking and willing to discuss.
So my turn to guess, intellectually arrogant?

Have I said that I believe so? :)
Wow, how unscientific and biaised can someone be to read an assertion in a hypothesis.

That's what raised my concern. I receive more and more emails from friends and relatives asking if they should get some. Not seing the risks, not even understanding how it works, but still willing to invest their savings. And it's so easy compared to "classical" trading. So I began wondering if there is any unseen risk other than those already known. A pure what if and some other thoughts.

I fear you may wait eternally as it is not :)

It doesn't prevent it from being used by anticapitalists to make their point, whatever it is.

Let me then reformulate my first question: Do you think some anticapitalist entity ideologically motivated could use Bitcoin in its fight against capitalism? 
Actually it's like trying to beat someone at his own game. Nothing new.  
Of course I don't think they will succeed bringing down capitalism and I never said so. However they could succeed converting more people to anticapitalism and damaging Bitcoin and the whole cryptocurrency. 
So again, it's from the point of view of this entity that the target would be capitalism, as an ideology, a system, a culture etc. And the tool/weapon is Bitcoin.

I mean used by those who believe that capitalism is evil to proove it. But certainly not threat the global economy at this early stage. 
Let's consider the case of North Korea. The government is mining while north korean doesn't have nor the right nor the possibility to own btc, which, in their point of view, protect them. In case they are able to "sell out", or inject if you prefer, a huge volume, wouldn't the value of btc drop?

"Bitcoin is capitalism", "Bitcoin is pure capitalism", "Bitcoin is actual capitalism"... whether it is or not isn't important, it's what people think it is, and any damage/failure of Bitcoin could be a major blow to capitalism. All ideologies feed on people trust/faith in them.
Obviously the good ol' capitalism is not concerned, not yet. But the hope of a change, of an alternative free market/trade, of a "new" capitalism less regulated, global, somehow anonymous and even fair will be lost. Think about the impact on the people, those investing every dime of their savings/salaries and even bypassing their countries prohibition, not the wealthy whose bitcoins are just a part of a diverse portfolio. 
Ideologues don't see things like other people, nor have the same agendas/strategies. And NK is a very good example: no scruples in hacking, ddos attacking, ransomwaring etc. We shouldn't underestimate them as they were able to act fast and hide their tracks. So why wouldn't they make this move against capitalists all around the world, as individuals, not countries. They'll make a lot of money, and the huge bonus, they will get to say to the rest of the world: "You see, we told you so, capitalism is evil, and you lost your money".
But again it just a worst case hypothesis.

While English isn't my mother tongue, still these are my words. Sorry, maybe try reading it again :)
