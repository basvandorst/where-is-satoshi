So bitcoin confirmed for another speculator toy and not an actual cryptocurrency this means.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:17:40
Ok but does the verification time decrease too ? Because if people still need 8 hours to buy a soda i don't see the point.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:19:03
Doesn't this validate that bitcoin is not more a digital currency but now is a digital asset ? You don't invest in a currency.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:27:34
So if LN is implemented Bitcoin could actually be used as a currency and not only as a digital asset ?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:24:01
People will adopt it when it will have a stable value and when most holder and speculator will sell their bitcoin. Bitcoin should be used a a currency constantly moving, not as another toy.

As long as people will push for speculation on cryptocurrencies and not for people to actually use them to buy/sell products/good i will not take any crypto seriously.
@_date: 2018-08-28 07:13:49
This kind of post once again put into light that people mainly see cryptos as speculation toys and not as currencies to be used to buy/sell good/products.
As long as people will get into crypto to make money and not to use this money then i will welcome all crashs.

In the usa maybe but not where i live (france).
What is the point of having more than one credit card ? For me having more than one is a sign that you don't do well with your money if you always have to use a credit for anything.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:28:22
This is exactly what is wrong with cryptos right now. They should have zero holding/speculation value and should be used only as a decentralized currency. And if dark market are the only reason then that mean there is no good reason to support bitcoin or another cryptos if most users are criminals.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:47:50


What are they ? Because right now aside from criminals using it or speculation it seems there are none
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:29:23


This. Right now cryptocurrency is more about speculation to get a return than actually making it a viable money.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:13:52
Now if people into bitcoin would actually use it as a currency instead of a holder/speculator toy maybe more people would take it seriously...
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:23:46
I would not buy bitcoin now or anytime if it is not used as a currency.
In my point of view speculation should not be legal.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:25:31


Major drawback in my opinion, this will only help criminals.
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:28:45
This kind of post is why people don't embrace more bitcoin and why there is this feeling that this is only for speculators.
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:26:51




When high fees are the main problem of this currency...
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:56:54
I don't know where you live and what kind of bank you have but here you can do retty much whatever and how many transfer you want and it will not cost you more than 5$ a year.
 4cents + 4cents +4 cents...is growing very fast.
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:21:53
This is actually false for me. Bitcoin and in general cryptocurrency made me even more hating stocks and people's greed in general.
What started as a mean for people to pay/buy products and services, to be available for everyone and with anonymity has become a horde of gamblers and speculators ruining the very spirit of cryptocurrencies. 
I am still interested in what will happen to bitcoin and other cryptos but no way i am using them. It would be a betrayal of what i stand for right now. People showed me how quickly they could ruin something.
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:50:15
Good, people should not hold, they should use it to make a flow of bitcoin.
Holding is playing the speculator game, not helping bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:36:25
I will consider money when two thing are fixed :
- The horribly high transaction fees
- the amount of speculators must diminish
Right now it is mostly an asset, not a money. It is too volatile to be used as a money too.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:35:52
The day it will crash it will be really interesting.
Such volatility is the main problem of bitcoin, it will never be used by the mass if people don't know if they will be able to eat tomorrow because of this volability. Also trading fee should be null as they are right now in most banks outside the usa (if you pay more than 10$ annually for your bank you are being scammed).
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:08:24
But does what does it means for people who are not speculators, holders and miners ? For the common people who will one day have to use it.
High volatility is a cause of concern of you want people to trust your currency for a day to day use.
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:13:28
I too can make random prediction for in 15 years...
@_date: 2017-05-07 06:18:10
Why would you advertise speculation?
No way people will try bitcoin if it is not stable.
@_date: 2017-05-07 13:48:01
I was talking about users, not investors.As an user I want security of value in my money.
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:07:30
Why wouldn't it be better if more currency was actually circulating ? 
@_date: 2017-07-06 06:18:25
So once again rich people investing in it will get richer and normal users will not be able to do anything or get any bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:10:38
This is stupid. The more people will convert to bitcoin the more expensive bitcoin will be. Making it harder and harder to convert. Only rich people would be able to convert in this system.
