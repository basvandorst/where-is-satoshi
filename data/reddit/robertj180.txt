Well compared to using Coinbase or other nice IOS GUI wallet, getting a LN node up and running on mainnet is order of magnitude more difficult.

It's also supposed to be decentralized in terms of the blockchain. As long as no single entity or organization controls 51% or more of the miners then no one can alter the blockchain.

While it is an open source project, that doesn’t mean just anyone can contribute. Pull requests have to be approved by those with privileges on the (code) repository. So if you have a majority of the developers with commit privileges all working for the same company it actually does become quite centralized.

I kind of like to think of it as custom amount prepaid spending cards.

LN is a network separate from, but still dependent on Bitcoin. To use it, you'll need a Lightning Network wallet and I believe this is what will be holding up most adoption of LN.  Testing is occurring of the LN codebase itself (eclair/lnd), but besides [Zap]( I've seen very little info on LN wallet availability or timelines. 
Certain wallets do have Segwit enabled. SegWit is more big picture, if enough people adopt SegWit, it should allow us to put more transactions into blocks which should help with fees.
Schnorr, like SegWit, is an idea to help lower the size of data going into blocks. Basically it is an attempt to shorten the size that signatures take up in a transaction.
