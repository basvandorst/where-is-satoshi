While I agree with your claim that bitcoin market is essentialy a glorified gambling site I feel there is a stark difference between original cryptocurrency supporters and the masses that followed. 
While the core supporters invested in the technology and its applications the masses invested in money which in effect turned this thing into the biggest roulette machine the world has ever seen. 
And I feel this roulette machine might actually ruin the whole project. Most of the core group of supporters did not expect the insane payouts. They simply saw an idea they supported and went for it. They invested in the future ... while the masses invested in money. 
Like everything human creates somewhere on the road the whole thing spiralled out of control. Very few people today talk about blockchain technology, its applications and the future it can provide ... instead they talk about numbers. The immense success might actually ruin the project.  Simply because it became a glorified gambling - only in gambling you invest in money alone to obtain more money. Every other form of investment has a different object of investment than itself. And when this gigantic slot machine starts rolling empty it could actually ruin the project itself. 
It is a mess many do not see. It is actually too big to be real. It has to drop. Because once people realise they are actually losing money (I would argue that most sub 1k will at some point) it will revert back from investment in money that balooned that thing to high heaven to being an investment in technology. But would the damage by then be done? 
TLDR: by sheer coincidence coin market turned into a gambling machine from an investment in technology. The turn that might in the end be fatal for the technology itself.

You should be scared about every dip. Because technically only small percent invested in technology it all became a big gamble. You are effectively gambling that others are not scared about the dip enough to plummet the value. There is no "fixed value" that you are investing in.

Indeed. And that is why markets crash. And nobody can stop it. It is really a thing of beauty how real interferes with virtual.

That is the problem of decentralisation - if the value of value is only value - in case of crypto the value of crypto is crypto ... it is worthless the moment it drops. It is insane why people would think it isn't. Thanks for the input. I am not an economist but I thought that as well.

Why would I be a shill? I even said the technology is great mate, it was just handled wrongly. There is no such thing as free money or as I call it perpetuum moneyle.

The bounce is twitce the impactful ... until it isn't. Your mistake is that you treat coin market as a guaranteed money which is isn't. Rookie mistake many wall street smart guys did and lost everything.

bu half the investors are not here for technology. And tech is proving difficult to implement. All the while the coin itself is too unstable to be used as a currency.

Hmmm ... maybe I should explain more. I feel the core did very poor job in advertising technology behind the coins. Everyone just fell for the jumps

The problem is it might become too expensive. I am not disputing the technology but these numbers are unsustainable.

In my opinion wrong "market strategy" caused this dip and could effectively destroy otherwise great technology. About few years ago I started noticing a dramatic switch from "invest into this technology it is great, it is the future" to "invest in this coin it will make you lambos". 
I cannot help but tie this to the core founders. They went out there and sold the technological inovation for unrealistic promise of becoming rich. I feel crypto became 2 big because of that. Now it could tank into obscurity just because a lot of those who came in for lambos will realise that it is not perpetuum moneyle.
