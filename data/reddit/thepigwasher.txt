I don't think you understand the article or how shops work. 
My question still stands. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:26:12
With having fun you mean losing your money?
@_date: 2014-12-21 21:09:20
Does it upset you that your circle jerk failed?
@_date: 2014-12-22 14:03:37
No it isn't. Don't be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:38:27
Here we go again. 
How exactly am i a troll? Where or how am i trolling?
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:50:50
No. I'm just not joining the circle jerk. That's only reason why i'm considered a troll. 
And you fully realize this. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:13:07
It's only been posted about 70 times here. 
Edit. Yes i made a mistake. I missed those added words. It's absolutely horrible. Keep downvoting me. I clearly deserve to be punished for making a mistake. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 16:04:46
You have to be kidding me. That guy is absolutely bat shit crazy and should be getting help. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 18:09:06
Ok and when are you gonna explain how it's relevant?
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:04:12
The seller says it will take 2 to 3 days to send the coins and after 2 days you already started threatening him?
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:05:46
Ok and how is it relevant exactly other than you saying it is relevant?
Is me paying for a pack of smokes yesterday relevant to Bitcoin as well?
@_date: 2014-12-21 14:27:32
It's not rebounding strong. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 13:25:45
I just hope my friends and family never bump into this sub and see what a loonies Bitcoin attracts. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:38:56
Yes he did. Rejecting reality just because you don't agree with it won't get you anywhere in life. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 08:08:05
You are completely paranoid. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 07:36:02
Exactly. But it is impossible to discuss this here. You are talking to a group of young people who love drugs and hate the government. 
They lost any sense of reality. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 18:19:11
It was posted in 2 threads but quite a while ago. No idea how to find it anymore. That guy was all over the place with his nicks. Within 2 minutes he could downvote you to -5. Which he did. 
And like i said once exposed nobody cared. Because obviously he was pro Bitcoin so it was all good. 
I don't care either way but if you make these kind of threads then at least post shills and trolls from both sides. This guy was nastier than any Buttcoin troll i've seen. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 17:01:58
That guy was great. 
You know OP, a while back someone exposed a Bitcoiner with at least 10 usernames which he used to circle jerk Bitcoin news and downvote manipulate anything even slightly critical of Bitcoin. What he did was worse than anything i've seen from a buttcoiner. 
Want to know the funny part? Nobody cared. The guy who exposed him was laughed at and ridiculed. 
Anything to say about his and why people like him are not included in your list?
@_date: 2014-12-20 15:18:29
Did your master Alex Jones tell you this?
@_date: 2014-12-22 06:35:30
Recently i kept reading how the price doesn't matter. 
I assume that's only the case when we're going down?
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:14:14
Please man. It's not breaking when 10 others before you posted it already. Of course also with the word breaking. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 21:54:46
Just like the reasons why Bitcoin was gonna be huge in 2014. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 07:46:04
Asking for investment advice here is completely useless. I really don't understand why 5 people a day do so. 
Nobody, really nobody on this planet knowsxwhere the price will go. 
Every answer you get will be yes, no, maybe. Throw some darts at some answers and you'll get the same result. 
I'm truly wondering what people like you expect exactly when you ask that question here. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 20:11:01
Oh how Bitcoiners love the downvote button. It gets abused so much here. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:16:45
You forgot to mention how this is relevant to Bitcoin. 
So no answer but downvoted to hell anyway. Yup, i'm in @_date: 2014-12-21 14:32:58
Of course he realizes it's bullshit but look where you are. 
Over here the most sensationalized nonsense gets to the mainpage. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:35:05
Can't wait to see how Bitcoin is relevant. So go ahead OP. Explain it to us. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 13:01:01
3 months is long term now?
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:24:16
While i don't agree with the punishment your comparison is just silly. 
Everyone knows drugs isn't all peace, love and fun. 
It's very deeply connected with crime and murder. 
At least be honest with your examples. 
I also know your next answer is that that's all the government's fault for making illegal but please let's not go there. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 09:24:15
How does using Bitcoin avoid these laws?
Just keep downvoting me for asking a serious question. What's wrong with this place?
@_date: 2014-12-22 13:59:46
How the hell is anybody here supposed to know the answer to that?
@_date: 2014-12-20 16:51:03
You must be confused with Ross. But anyway they weren't dropped. I wish you nutters would stop spreading this lie. 
I repeat: they weren't dropped. 
I understand your confusion. Must be hard to keep up with all these lunatic conspiracies. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:07:58
I don't believe you.
