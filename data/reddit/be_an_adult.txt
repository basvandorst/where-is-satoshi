Found a wallet with 0.006 BTC in it, worth literally pocket change at time of purchase ($1.40). Now it's worth somewhere around $60-80, feeling good about looking back into it. Might as well hodl and not sell during a slump.

Just got another $30 worth of BTC, now I'm trying to figure out how to use the excess balance on this visa prepaid card (between $5-10) to pick up another little bit so I can actually use the balance for something that's not sitting around in a card forever.

Ok, thank you for the explanation! I had that BTC in my wallet since Jan '16, so definitely before 01 Aug

I just found an old wallet of mine through Coinbase and found some BCH on it. Can you explain what happened and how that went to my wallet?

Any updates on the address?

When I made some less-than-legal purchases at $400 I got about 0.1x. Now it could be worth over $1k had I not actually purchased the things that I never even used

EdEY(v/u)5(v/u, leaning more to V)3TfN(I/T)nXHT
That's the general idea of what I'm seeing here, the Z/2 may be mitigated if you cross your Z or loop your 2, the A4N may be brute forced as with the 9N?, I'm feeling s more than a 5 based on how you wrote your 5 but it's worth a shot, V/U is easy if you know it is your habit to tail your U, I'T is something that some others may not have thought about. Hope that helps!

I'm listening for Barber: Adagio for Strings as I'm browsing reddit and one of the movements made this even better of a post. Highly recommend

BASS is about to have its initial ICO. We only accept US ass pennies at the moment. Also our whitepapers are no longer quite as white as they used to be (but they still look like toilet paper!)
