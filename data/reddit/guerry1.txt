It’s impressive that his school has a prof that studies crypto...

Honestly, you should be very impressed. One of my best friends is a very well published economics and finance professor at a great school. He knows absolutely nothing about blockchains and crypto.

The key phrase was, “at this pace.” I agree. At this pace adoption will take a very long time. But what happens when the pace picks up? All it will take is for one major cooperation to decide to adopt BTC as a legit form of payment in order for things to begin to pick up. And it doesn’t have to be consumer driven, it can be (and probably will more likely be) business-to-business transactions.

How many times does Microsoft have to miss the boat on new technologies for people to understand that they aren’t an innovative company? 
Let me rephrase. All it will take is an innovative major corporation to decide that they want to use blockchain tech...then it will go mainstream.
Also, I would add that neither of the two companies you mention tried very hard.
