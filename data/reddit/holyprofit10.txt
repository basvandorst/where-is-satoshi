Do you actually know they are working on this? Every public statement tells us everything is fine - if this is inside info it would be great.
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:57:19
Oh you! You got me
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:51:34
Yes I think we've established that it's fine now - but those transactions on the 10/11th never went through and the BTC were never sent. Check the block chain if you don't believe us. Can anyone else that withdrew recently and it was fine please read the above posts - thanks
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:02:42
That would be the best option - it would leave us with some hope

Hi JamboRambo - Please add zetec84 and pangcong from the other thread
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:17:11
Paulgr does indeed seem like a good guy - but not sure they can help much
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:21:06
Patience would be fine - if *they* would tell us this and then say something like "we will try to get your coins to you within ..."  that would be excellent. But - er. issuing fake tx id's - ?? 
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:57:58
Yay Jambo!!
@_date: 2014-02-18 07:10:18
Seriously? Jeez. Who banned you? I thought the mods might be on our side
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:15:27
OK guys - I got my coins. Looks like they're clearing us out! If it helps, today I submitted a 2nd ticket that was very short with the ID in the subject, and the bare details in the message. The fixed message had the link to the blockchain! (My much longer merged ticket is still sitting there unclosed). I'll keep checking this thread to see how it's going.
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:47:44
With a bit of luck it won't be long. It looks like they're working through them. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:43:54
So the fake hashes were a result of the attack? But why then just post the fake tx id into the ticket and close it when as you say it is clear what's happened?
@_date: 2014-02-19 09:54:35
Just a thought but if they solve these at the rate of one per week we are looking at 2 months for the rest of us. Hope we can change the title to "two weeks" "three weeks" "eight weeks" and so on?!
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:53:06
I sincerely hope that's true. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:13:14
And for the naysayers - my own info: 
the address (unused on blockchain)
and the withdrawal from my account 
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:09:39
Interesting analysis - there's probably something in it
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:29:04
But they need to tell us what they are doing and if they are even looking into it. Right now I would happily pay the 5% gox bribe to see my coins. Also opening more tickets - they just merge them into one long one - or if you let it close completely you are back to square one.
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:11:01
Congrats - this is like waiting at the luggage carousel
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:33:13
Holy cow - there's hope! What did you do? They haven't responded to me since 15th Feb with even the fake hash. I have a long ticket now (mainly with my own replies). Should I close it and open a new one or is that dangerous? FYI, I noticed that maxcarjuzaa from the bitcointalk.org thread got his coins a few hours ago.
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:53:06
Try posting to btce.com on 
And maybe try submitting a new short ticket: my second one was picked up quickly (i.e. it was assigned to support A2 within 1/2 hr) and went through in a couple of hours while the first one still sat there 8 days old. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 07:13:48
Yes we know thanks - slowly now - i.t. w.a.s. w.i.t.h.d.r.a.w.a.l.s. o.n. t.h.e 1.0.t.h. a.n.d. 1.1.t.h. that didn't go through.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:10:31
Keep making this point until you get screwed. I would say it's fine until it doesn't work - and then it definitely isn't.  Personally i am now looking for an exchange with a physical presence.
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:50:09
Me too - I have withdrawal waiting from the 10th. Again had my ticket closed once (with no actual action taken). No real response.
ID  -14.1108836 BTC Withdrawal BTC to address 1EHdBf8LP84ba8bdkbtjMSusaMGmkNcvEx 11.02.14 00:14:45
It was never sent. The address has not been used in the block chain. Also people that have never had a problem - please do not tell us that. Until a couple of weeks ago neither had we.
By the way - my communication with them is EXACTLY the same as btc-rawted - just change the numbers. I haven't received the fixed and then fake tx yet but I am waiting for that. The minimum check they would do (if they were honest) would be a check of the block chain - it is VERY suspicious that they provide broken tx id's and then close the ticket.
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:37:51
Yes many did get their withdrawal back on the 13 and 14th. Hearty congratulations to them. Not all did though.
