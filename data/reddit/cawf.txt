No, what's confusing is, for example - going to a regular fiat currency exchange to buy USD and they give you ZWD instead. That's what's happening with bitcoin.com - you go to buy bitcoin and get swindled into buying the lesser bch instead.

Thanks for doing good work PinappleFund, keep it up! &amp; yes you are corrrect, it was Bitcoin-Qt back in the day, not Bitcoin Core-Qt ;)

The integrity of pia HAS changed. Were you to offer BCH as a payment option and stated the reasons for doing so, we would have absolutely no problem with that. 
However Rick has clearly influenced the company to adopt the "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin" line, and that is a clear case of deception.
These decisions are made at the C-level in the organization, the people who drive the direction and strategy of the business in consensus...and as such by opting-in to this deceptive practice your organization's ethics now come in to question. I cancelled and have moved my business to another VPN provider.

This. r/btc mods need to be booted out and free up the sub with people who actually discuss btc instead of bch astroturfing 24/7. Can we make this happen?

Isn't this an old story from 2016?
On their support pages it's still there..

 - "Eat sand, hamburgers are unhealthy!"
 - "Urine is better and more hydrating!"
 - "Play netball! Shooting hoops is lame!"
Bitcoin.com,  and r/btc are censorship in it's absolute worst form - suppressing discourse by taking legitimate communication channels hostage and spewing out propaganda.
While you're at it - report bitcoin.com as well ...
Anyone know how to report r/btc?

I'm pretty sure back in 2011 I wasn't using a "Bitcoin Core" wallet and I'm also pretty sure that on the exchanges now I don't buy "Bitcoin Core". It's a strategic play and in this space perception to the masses is reality. If we call it "bitcoin core" frequently and create that image then it's lowered to same level as the alt "bitcoin XXXX"'s.

So thus far we have...
bitcoin.com = pro-bch r/btc = pro-bch  = pro-bch coinbase.com = pro-bch blockchain.info = pro-bch
Super-confusing for the average punter with TLD's and social accounts operated by pro-bch'ers.. if the new-to-crypto's &amp; general public are trying to get on-board bch is going to keep increasing their market-cap purely through errors of intention to buy bitcoin and ending up with bch.

Stop playing into their hands by diluting the bitcoin brand - bitcoin is bitcoin. They're trying to make us adopt the "bitcoin core" moniker which is a tacit surrender of the "bitcoin" name. 
It's a strategic play to lessen the authority of bitcoin by putting it on the same level as the also-ran alts who adopted the bitcoin xxxx naming convention.

Around the time of the bch pump I logged in and there was a timely coordinated prompt to buy bitcoin cash on the dashboard IIRC.
Then..there's also this -

This. bitcoin.org needs a makeover to combat bitcoin.com's slick shill pages.

"Bitcoin Core pages on Bitcoin.org are maintained separately from the rest of the site. " .. "New educational content about Bitcoin was added to Bitcoin.org over time, but that home page remained even when the name of the original program was changed to Bitcoin Core" Riiiight..

Afraid it's true kenneth, it was added and added in a sneaky underhanded way as a surprise to everyone.. everyone except those in the know who (insider)traded it on the first day trying to induce a bch takeover - which failed spectacularly.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:39:28
Off topic - it's not about wallets. It's about perception. The PR and perception play here is to make bitcoin lower down to the bitcoin xxxx level by making it a bitcoin xxxx (core) also. It's a sneaky play.

Looks like the bet on bch isn't playing out they way they wanted and they're funneling people into other alts.. 
Use one of these instead and spread the word!

Enough already you two! Bitcoin is Bitcoin! That's all. BTC is the currency symbol, core is the wallet software. It's not that hard people.
