And that's why you believe in science and the big bang?
Can you apply scientific method to them? I'll spare you the google search, you can't.
In fact for the big bang to even be possible it is necessary that most of the scientific laws are suspended for a brief period of time. So your science really contradicts itself and you're claiming it's not just "belief".
Once again:
God: ∞
You: 0
You prove my point, an atheist that thinks he's cool for bashing believers because he read it on the internet.

Because wars are started by religion LOL.
What about golden rule? Problem is not religion, it's rather the lack of that's the cause of almost every major crysis.


 
It's the same with God, you're just trying to "measure" Him with the wrong instruments.

Faith in science is on the same if not worse level. (something exploded out of nothing and created everything hahahaha)
Christianity 1 
You 0

("I have faith" or "I believe in")
How is this an irrational thought? 
You have faith in science, you believe in science...

Care to enlighten me which one is then? Never heard of a new theory that explains it "better" ( besides Genesis but that's not for this discussion). I'm seriously interested in these theories.


Well that was also the level of science back then. More confirmation of how lacking and incomplete science is.


Of course there is, that is why I suggested reading Gödel.
My understanding of science is that it's a probabilistic estimation of how things work based on incomplete ( and will always be so) knowledge.
Which is quite a wonderful pursuit that greatly advanced civilization but shouldn't be considered the "go-to" truth. Hence the 'belief' part.


I'll be honest with you, calling me a Christian is a bit of a stretch. I should have treated you with much more wisdom and love but I figured you're a low value troll and decided to play on a level you'd actually have a shot. (not in proving me wrong but be the better troll - seems like you failed both anwyay).


Cool so basically you accept that humanity will never be able to explain the beginning without an outside "force" or whatever you want to call it.


Actually there are plenty of things that are verifiable, you just lack the frame of mind of being open to knowledge other than your strict set of beliefs you have now.
There's also the fact that if there was a proper way to verify God's existence (proving it to others that is because you can verify it personally by turning to Him with an open heart), value of faith would be 0 and 'free will' a joke.
Also can you rationally and logically explain this picture to me?
Have you ever acted on "hunches", or experienced synchronicities, and do you believe logic alone can guide us through emotional and moral grounds? 


Well for me its enough to justify that my belief can be logical ( in a logical context I don't yet fully understand but hey humans and their limitations huh) while you claim all religious belief is irational/ilogical. Who's being dense now?
I don't need proof and will not try to convince you of anything, my proof is based on subjective experiences alone but I know 100% that God exists.


Left this for last because it's very wrong. First of all what you probably refer to as Christianity, is the Catholic and 1000 other sects that are all focusing on surface level of things and have long strayed away from the teachings of Christ. You're right about them being mainstream but also, funnily(or sadly rather), are the main reason that people are pulled away from the truth ( which also funnily was actually predicted by the Bible) 
There's nothing irrational in believing that we should all love each other because it will make the world a better place. ( of course unless you consider love itself is irrational but I really hope you won't live life without experiencing it because it's beautiful).
Real Christianity is the most non-mainstream religion there is I think and it's numbers dwindling because it has all odds against it ( not only other religions and atheist but people that call themselves Christian while being anything but too)

Man dump that girl. Honestly.
That amount of disrespect shouldn't be tolerated. Regardless of the subject discussed.

Technically that makes it non-deterministic.
I'm not going to define freedom, as it is indeed a complex &amp; hard problem. But deterministic or not, we are to act as if we have complete freedom.
