Because of Twitter API limitations, you have to log in with a Twitter account.

Haha, I would do it, but without any money to invest it is hard :D  
That is exactly why I want to make this stuff public, since I can't use the data without money. :D

That is exactly what we are working on with my friend, but hard to find time next to our 9-5 jobs...  
But hopefully we will be ready within a week and we will make and open beta test :)

Basically using a natural language processing library with a sentiment analysis tool, which was taught with a sample of ten thousands tweets/posts from different social medias. It is not looking for words like "bad" etc. to decide the polarity, it (tried) to understand the whole content.

As I mentioned in an other comment, only four subreddits are analyzed: news, worldnews, technology and politics. Users will be able to customize their subreddits.

That is in our long-term plans :)  
Also sending you the key in PM.

Hey! That sounds awesome! Any suggestions about how to get into this field?
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:58:26
Thank you! I will change that before the open beta.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:35:27
That is the next thing we implement, hopefully within 2 weeks :) 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:32:28
You are welcome! :)  
If you want to test it out I can give you a beta key for 15 searches.  
Cheers, Mark

Currently only technology, politics and worldnews are analyzed. In the live version there will be possibility to choose custom subreddits.

Also other interesting correlations: "Donald Trump" search term:   
and today's Gallup Poll:   
There is 1% difference between the sentiment of the last 1k tweets and today's data on Trump's approval from Gallup.

HODL:   
All tweets are the last 1k tweets, recent is from the last few minutes.

Hey! I have been checking it almost daily, and there is a clear correlation every time. I'd you want I will send you a key to test it :)

Yup, unfortunately we are not UX/frontend devs (I'm python, my friend is C dev). But we received a lot of feedback about the UI, so I will redesign it before the live version.
