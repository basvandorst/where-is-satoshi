The world has never seen (so far as im aware) a decentralized currency other than gold or precious metals, which are not practical in this modern age. Bitcoin is a paradigm shift. It will either be made illegal or it will take over, thats my feeling.

no, it is not ethically right. No, I would not do it.

Yes, although the price rising can turn the 2's into 3's as well. All the complexities aside, the prices changes when a person wants to buy or sell so much that they are willing to take a hit by crossing the spread.

A person holding coins that spends them may actually cause the price to go down, since the person who now holds them may want to sell them and convert them to fiat. Unless the person who now holds them can further transact their business in BTC...in which case it gets harder and harder for buyers to find coins and the price goes up. So it may actual depend on what merchant you spend with and how they source their merchandise.

In other words, a lot of people make emotional decisions without supporting evidence because they cannot intellectually grasp what Bitcoin is and how it works. Agreed!

It has to do with transportation. You cant practically move gold around, so you use notes and eventually just 1's and 0's and keep the gold locked up. BTC does not have that problem. The only reason I can see for it to move toward a centralized system is for "instant" confirmations, where some central authorities that are trusted by merchants hold peoples bitcoins. Merchants then accept a transfer instantly if it comes from a trusted address. I'll bet this problem can be solved in another way though.

Yes for a few weeks now. All experiences good. Recommended.

try opening an account at campbx. They accept dwolla and and will not require you verify for under 10k. Once you have some BTC, you can transfer them to mt. gox...or any other exchange without verification if you want to trade.

the relationship is clearly not linear. point well taken though
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:24:13
You are exactly the sort of person Bitcoin needs. Bravo!

I've been using them for a month now. Highly recommended. Always sufficient liquidity and actually better prices than Mt. Lag.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:39:21
used them for the last month. Wonderful so far.

[bitcoinium]( just added mBTC to its chart price and wallet calculator.

I have purchased more than that with them, all at good prices.

There are four types of people in the market:
(1) People holding coins and will sell IF the price goes higher,
(2)People wanting coins and will buy IF the price goes lower,
(3)People who want to buy NOW,
(4)People who want to sell NOW.
When the 3's outnumber the 4's, the price goes up. When the 4's outnumber the 3's, the price falls. This is because if a 3 wants to buy they will have to pay more and if a 4 wants to sell they will have to take less.

You clearly have no concept of marketing (or business for that matter).

not a stupid question. A bitcoin wallet is two things: a public and private key. A paper wallet contains both of those. You can only access (spend) bitcoins if you have the private key. A paper wallet is nothing more than those two keys printed out. It helps if they also have QR-codes so you do not have to type them in manually when you need to spend them.
* go to 
* Turn your internet connection OFF
* generate some public/private key pairs.
* print out the public/private keys. This is your paper wallet.
* delete the private key from your computer.
* turn your internet connection back on.
* now you can send money to your paper wallet, but the private key is nowhere but on that piece of paper. 
Dont put all your bitcoins in one key, but rather spread them out. (I have dozens) When you need to spend bitcoins, you can import your private key into a wallet (blockchain.info/wallet for example) and spend them. Just scan the private QR code and you are good to go.

Here is how I do it. I generate one or more paper wallets (offline!) and transfer BTC into those, keeping them in a safe place. Download a program like multibit for your computer or something else for your phone. Transfer only as much BTC into those as you need "cash at hand".

I have and its worked great.

A developer here. Mt. Goxes streaming API is horrible. Days leading up to the crash it started to disconnect after a minute or two. This forces the client programs to attempt a reconnect, but that whole process can take up to a minute or more, only to get booted off again. Essentially, the streaming API services are just broken at the moment.

Ive used them for the last several months. Great so far.
