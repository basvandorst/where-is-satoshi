Scarcity is what adds intrinsic value. Before FIAT gold was the primary medium of exchange, and precious metals are finite.

I assume they would utilize the ethereum Blockchain. Considering that the blockchain would be easier for the fed/private banks to integrate into their current system.

Do you believe Bitcoin will be the ultimate Cryptocurrency? Or do you think Ethereum or Heatledger can ultimately surpass Bitcoin?
Not trying to hate on Bitcoin just want to hear an expert opinion.

I was a little skeptical at first of this guy. But after watching all seven videos and discussing it with my ECON professor, he is pretty spot on with his estimates (in my opinion).
We are due for a massive correction, and Bitcoin will benefit the most from that correction.

Considering the influence Peter Thiel has on Trump I would say $2000 in 2017. (plus there are a lot of headwinds in the financial markets coming up) 
Apparently Trump added more members associated with Thiel on his transition team.

He predicted the trump win early on. This guy is usually pretty accurate and will most likely be right about Bitcoin as well.
