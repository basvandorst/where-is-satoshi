Our current economy is already subject to that. And our fiat paper money will always devalue. At least crypto has the possibility of gaining value. Remember, it doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be better. And decentralized crypto is hands down better. All money is volatile. But I would more quickly put my trust in a currency that is capable of improving over time as opposed to perpetually declining.

It forces us into a perpetual debt scheme that ultimately funnels wealth to a small portion of the population. Creates vast inequality and unnecessary structural violence. Plus plenty of other fucked up things it does. Should try researching it. Plenty of information out there.

I have been researching the Federal Reserve and our monetary system for over a decade now. Has nothing to do with watching one 'shitty movie'. To assume such a thing is ignorance in it's purest form. How about you learn about how your money is created as opposed to shit on people who tell you the truth just because you are too lazy to look at the truth yourself. Plenty of resources that support everything I said. Not my fault you are too lazy to research them.

The dollar creates debt the moment it comes into existence. It's loaned to us, at interest. Has been since 1913. So yes, the dollar does, in fact create, debts. Perpetual and unpayable debts. We don't make our own money anymore. Haven't for a while now. Money IS debt.
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:44:39
Technically, almost all money is already digital. Which makes it even more hilarious when people are against crypto for that reason.
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:31:37
Ever notice how our dollar rapidly inflated, perpetuated unpayable debts, and was not made by us, but loaned to us at interest ever since December 1913? We got scrooged pretty hard. :/

The whole financial system is a problem because of Central banking such as the Federal Reserve. I realize the whole financial system is flawed. But why attack something that is merely a symptom of that flaw instead of aiming your sights on where it all begins from in the first place?
@_date: 2018-05-18 23:16:41
I would argue the federal reserve is far more crooked. You know how much harder corrupt banking practices would be without it?
Honestly, we were doing ok. Then Fed reserve act went through and we have been downward spiraling ever since. I just don't understand why we don't remove the thing that started the downward spiral in the first place. Or at least have more focus on it.
I mean, we have been annoyed with banks since the first depression. Still plenty of banks doing plenty of fucked up shit. So it just urks me that we think doing the same thing over and over is going to somehow yield a different result.
Yeah, you are right about hollywood. My turn for a relevant quote! :D
"The country gotta pay the Fed Reserve
Kick back to the banksters—haven't you learned?
You protest cops or patrols on the street
But I bought city hall, so I own the police" - Immortal Technique
I honestly just feel like as long as the Fed is in control of our money, we can only really operate in their realm.
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:24:12
Well banks are corporations that must operate under our laws. The federal reserve is a private institution that doesn't necessarily. They don't even have to fully disclose what it is they do. Not only that, but the federal reserve is what gives our country money in exchange for bonds. 
I understand that banks have fractional reserve practices, which makes the practice of loaning harmful to our value of money, but the Federal reserve are the institutions that finance banks and somewhat give them their purpose in the first place. 
Using the Fed as our source of making money seems like a much higher priority than complaining about Bank Of America, considering without the federal reserve there probably wouldn't even be a BoA anyways. Just wonder why we keep trying to solve issues without even addressing the underlying issue that made it that way to begin with.
Central banking systems are messed up, especially since our fed reserve is neither federal, nor a reserve. Why make the target thousands of branches across the nation as opposed to one private institution that is clearly causing/allowing these problems to flourish in the first place?

Both options sucked, but at least we didn't get stuck with Hillary.

Not people who work at bank of america, or chase. The people who work and operate those banks are typically working class people. So I guess I am just confused as to why protesting against business occupied mostly by working class people seems to be a better target than a more fundamental issue that lies deeper at the core of the issue. Not necessarily saying it's wrong or anything. But it's like... why bother trying to demonize bank branches as opposed to demonizing central banking, like the federal reserve?
I mean, I don't bitch at nike or apple for fucked up human labor, I don't bitch at farmers for unfair farming practices, I don't bitch at doctors for health care issues because I realize that all stems from a more fundamental problem and it seems almost time wasting to be fighting symptoms as opposed to fighting the thing that made all this mess in the first place. Feel like this problem would have been dealt with a long time ago if we were more focused on things like the Federal Reserve and less on Chase and Bank of america, is all.
I understand the symbolism, but you got to remember most people are pretty stupid and won't connect the dots that way. They will just demonize bank of america. Which might mitigate the issue, but it definitely won't solve it. Just kinda been tired of mitigating the problem over and over again while the true problem goes largely unnoticed by most of the population. 
I dunno... just feel like killing a hydra by stabbing it's heart is far more affective then by simply cutting off a few of it's thousands of heads. I just don't see how demonizing banks actually solves the issue. So I don't understand such the heavy push from people to behave that way towards banks. They are symptoms of the problem, not the cause.

I'm a little confused. Why burning pictures of banks as opposed to the Federal Reserve burning? I mean I understand what it's going for, but wouldn't the concept of burning our central bank be far more effective than burning 4 branches of small banks that there are literally thousands of? lol either way, it's still damn good art.
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:39:40
That dances around the entire point I just made. If banks run the gov't and the Federal reserve is what allows these banks to flourish in the first place, wouldn't it be far more effective to prioritize that as a bigger issue?
And I love Mr. Robot, but a tv sitcom is not really a strong place to quote. Literally hundreds of quotes about why central banking systems are fucked up from people who actually existed, and you took on from a fictional character on tv? Alright then...

Depends. How big of a fire do you think you can make with all that paper?

Get a Rimac concept one. Pretty sure it's faster too!
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:02:47
I hope we can do that. Some of the people who tried to do that, actually, got killed just before making big moves that would pave the way for us to make our own money again. I wonder how many times something has to happen before people stop seeing it simply as coincidence.

Well... we technically benefit too, so he isn't wrong haha
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:00:15
Incorrect. There are things that have intrinsic value due to their properties or potential uses.
To say nothing has value is simply wrong. Gold has plenty of intrinsic value. Also, money is real, it's just built upon false pretenses and deception in today's world.
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:49:08


This is too much based on an assumption that things that are only directly valuable to you, individually, is how that value is defined. I believe that's incorrect. It's about it's objective value based on it's natural properties and uses.
Just because you don't see the value, does not mean it's there.
That would be like me saying quartz crystal has no value to me, despite the fact that I use phones and computers daily.
Apologies for the tangent line, you are right. All is on topic.
But I stay with my point, overall. You are assuming your perception of something of value (which is subjective) is the same as something having value based on it's properties (objective).
Value is subjective. Inherent value, not so much. The statement itself refers to an item's 'natural value', not it's 'perceived value'.
Gold has intrinsic value because it can do things better than many other materials. Not because we simply like it more, or it just seems more practical. It's a better material, based on its own, inherent, natural properties. Thus gold is objectively valuable.

The funny part is that it's technically supposed to be 'over 8000' but it got mistranslated when dubbed in english. Gotta love it.

It was valuable. Just not valuable to you. Be less biased and less offended, and you may be able to see that.

Necessity drives technological innovation too... not just what people want. I realize supply and demand is a huge economic driver, but it's not the ONLY economic driver.
The want of people is not the only variable. And to attach only one variable to it, would be incorrect. There are multiple influential factors, and it wouldn't be correct to overlook those.
Intrinsic value is not the same as objective opinion. False equivalency.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:45:14
huh? that's kind of an unnecessary tangent. We are talking about intrinsic value, not philosophical worth of life. Definitions are important, and this topic is about intrinsic value in the economic context.
The thing about intrinsic value, is it doesn't matter how you value life. The same gold civilizations used thousands of years ago, is still being used today. It has value based on the properties it has INTRINSICALLY.
Making muttered philosophical statements about 'well if you believe nothing has value, then nothing can have intrinsic value' is incorrect.
Gold has practical uses, lasts thousands of years, and there is only a limited amount of it. These are objective facts, not subjective opinions.

Economic progess = profit. Think of the word in context.

We see it as a fuck up, the banks see it as progress.

Our currency is already not controlled/owned by governments. Private institutions ultimately run our currency, not our government. Last few times we tried to allow our government the power to create money some shit went down.
