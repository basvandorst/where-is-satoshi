I believe the only way they know is because blockchain.info is connected to all the mining pools and they always release their blocks from those same node/IPs. They could just as easily release the blocks through a VPN or tor, or just relay them through some other random bitcoin node. 
There's also nothing stopping them from sub mining on another pool.. just setup a load of sockpuppets on some other pool to get work from the other pool and forward the work to their own miners.. that way it looks like the other pool with the sockpuppets is big when actually the hash power is still controlled by this middleman pool and they could suddenly divert it to anonymous block generation to perform a quick doublespend and then divert it back to sub mining again afterwards.
The stats by themselves are meaningless.. it's possible for instance that ghash.io has a load of sockpuppet accounts for other pools that make them look big and then everyone demands the 'community' leave ghash.io for some other pool which is actually orchestrating the whole thing.. so the few 'legit' users who leave ghash.io for the big pool that's secretly mining on ghash.io actually give even more power to the hidden pool. I'm not saying that's likely, but it's quite possible.

Essentially every bank card issued by a Canadian bank is enrolled in the interac system automatically and has been for almost 30 years. It isn't some startup company or anything.. it's an association of all Canada's largest banks. Visa and Mastercard are also 'digital payment systems' - most visa/mastercards issued in the UK now come with NFC too. I don't think it's particularly useful to compare payment networks setup by the largest banks who bring their entire customer bases by force with bitcoin which is a voluntary system.
