This is a very insightful article, what is especially interesting are the alignments of interest between long-term holders and developers against large enterprise and mining.  
I also agree with the OP, we need some more analysis of transpired events in this space.

I dont support Roger's reasons for forking bcash but I also don't support this attack on his character.  Posts like this sink to the same moral level as Ad hominem attacks signal that the attacking side is not the winning side of the argument.

“Few realize, especially outside of economists, that the prize in economics is not an “official” Nobel. . . . The award for economics came almost 70 years later—bootstrapped to the Nobel in 1968 as a bit of a marketing ploy to celebrate the Bank of Sweden’s 300th anniversary.”

Bannon has been removed from the Trump administration, lost his backing from the Mercers, no longer has a position at Breitbart, and his backed candidate Roy Moore lost an election for a senate race against a democrat in Alabama which is a deeply red state.  
So now he's done the classic 'pivot to blockchain'.  Where else does he have to go?  Fox news wouldn't even take him at this point.  Blockchain evangelism is all he has left.  Just a matter of time before he joins forces with Bcash.

*Minting coins mean there are no possible pre-existing relationships.*
Except you're not going to be minting coins on this machine itself - you'll need to point it at a mining pool which means that there will be no possible no-input coinbase transaction to your address.  
That means you're not going to "generate" coins on this machine (like most mining equipment) you'll earn bitcoins from a mining pool that have a full transaction history.  And paying $400 for a miner with no possibility of ROI.

On Mycelium you can see what unspent outputs are on what addresses.  I would recommend finding the addresses that show having significant amounts of bitcoin on Mycelium first, then cross checking those same addresses on a block explorer.
To check addresses that have unspent outputs go to Accounts tab, select your HD Account (Account 1, Account 2, etc..), once you highlight it other options will appear.  Next to 'Create Backup' you should see an icon that looks like this  ⋮  Tap that then choose 'Show Unspent Outputs'.  That will save you from having to cross-check 600 HD addresses.

An average person only needs a block explorer to assay received BTC, with gold more complicated heuristics are involved.
