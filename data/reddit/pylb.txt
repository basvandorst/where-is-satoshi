Never could have achieved that with a credit card.
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:45:46

posted here  and this too 
@_date: 2015-05-01 09:14:39
but you do realize that 150.000 dollars in one day is insignificant right
@_date: 2015-05-01 09:06:40
Yeah this is looking like it could be a nice domino show. Not sure it will be as good as the January one, but the setup is intriguing.
@_date: 2015-05-01 11:45:37
@_date: 2014-12-11 11:02:12
lol you guys got played, plgonzrx8 knows about bitcoin:
There are other results out there of course but I'm not gonna bother doing your research for ya
@_date: 2015-05-03 08:38:17
yeah but most of the people here are looking to recoup the money they spent on this get rich quick scheme, so they need the money to *bubble up*
@_date: 2015-05-01 09:08:03
prod cucked
@_date: 2015-04-19 10:31:47
do you remember what her salary was
@_date: 2015-04-28 11:03:55
you mean the agents that were working on a different case involving him than the one presented at trial
@_date: 2015-04-27 09:44:45
Stop daydreaming and jerking off and start actually doing stuff if you want bitcoin taken seriously.
@_date: 2015-04-15 08:12:51
Bitcoiners do seem like the type to need lawyers.
@_date: 2015-04-16 10:28:12
@_date: 2015-04-30 10:41:04


*and will disagree with such a system and prefer a decentralized currency
cuz lots of people feel like "the rich get richer while the poor get poorer" but they don't seem to do much about it
@_date: 2015-04-16 12:50:06
You, yeah.
The majority, nah.
@_date: 2015-04-30 10:46:29
I dont know why people use "hate" to describe opinions they disagree with.
@_date: 2015-04-30 10:27:46
You're not the mainstream. You're the minority who already know and care about bitcoin.
what the hell makes you think the mainstream shares your views
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:46:06
what about the people who put their coins in gox
@_date: 2015-04-23 22:41:40
n°2 is kind of hard to do when youve lost the private keys
also, totally not a cult guys
@_date: 2015-04-19 10:28:07
yah i heard apple was considering using kickstarter to fund their investments
@_date: 2015-04-20 08:31:43
Eh, I think Bitcoin can last until 2018.
@_date: 2015-04-24 00:08:31
make it good like fiat
@_date: 2015-04-20 08:38:30
so many idea guys in here
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:56:52
the one in maryland
@_date: 2015-04-09 14:02:34
Couldn't have anything to do with [this]( obviously.
It's not like two totally different dev teams made each game.
@_date: 2015-04-10 09:27:46
When you can afford to start throwing money out the window.
@_date: 2015-04-19 10:26:45
just like this shit post does
@_date: 2015-04-01 10:48:06
wesh Mark, bien ouej gro
@_date: 2015-04-29 07:16:30
because they're successful
@_date: 2015-04-23 16:47:24
also its your company
@_date: 2015-04-16 10:33:36
And they would ask you why they would want to send money to someone in Venezuela.
@_date: 2015-04-16 10:33:46
Don't buy drugs.
@_date: 2015-04-07 11:47:16
learn your toaster history
@_date: 2015-04-19 10:25:33
and then you could make a website where people exchange these Magic cards they have gathered
@_date: 2015-04-30 11:47:02
@_date: 2015-04-20 08:37:41
Just come on over to SomethingAwful
@_date: 2015-04-27 13:52:03
because bitcoin is good, drugs are good, and ulbricht is a successful captain of industry being unjustly put down by the government
any evidence he might have done anything remotely bad is just stuff planted by the feds
@_date: 2015-03-09 22:17:21
nah cuz fiat is useful and practical unlike bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:18:51
i think so because people who really get involved with bitcoin should be found incompetent
@_date: 2015-04-30 10:33:41
lol sucker
@_date: 2015-03-05 09:27:37
How Bitcoin reminds me of the Game Gear, and where we're headed
@_date: 2015-03-26 15:59:15
I'm pretty sure you understand and know exactly what they're after.
@_date: 2015-03-30 13:03:17
accurate username
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:57:36
@_date: 2015-04-19 10:38:30
Then they'll get robbed and their insufficient law enforcement won't be able to do shit about it.
@_date: 2015-03-03 11:08:28
We've got decent banking laws so bitcoin is even more useless than in the US.
@_date: 2015-03-18 11:58:41
threats on public internet forums are srs bsnss
@_date: 2015-03-18 12:04:20
@_date: 2015-03-31 11:53:44
hmm yes im sure this was the first time fed agents got caught stealing
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:04:00
5% of your 95K salary then.
@_date: 2015-03-20 13:14:22
this is pretty much the best page on the subject:
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:51:11
Hmm yes this one single datapoint is pretty great evidence that bitcoin is going to the moon.
@_date: 2015-03-19 10:58:40
lol if banks aren't opened on weekends in your country
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:34:15
the future is bleak
@_date: 2015-03-18 08:55:56
lol i agree what kind of idiot buys bitcoin and doesn't expect their value to go down
@_date: 2015-03-25 10:02:12
I may have found the problem:


@_date: 2015-03-18 07:26:34
He means unregulated business
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:41:37
you dont but you also dont infer the highest ones were corrupt in this particular case
otherwise i would assume all bitcoiners are child porn trafficking drug addicts
@_date: 2015-03-09 11:45:22
You should give some examples of your observations and explain how you came to your conclusion.
@_date: 2015-03-11 08:37:31
Ugh I know my mom owns more beanie babies than I do!
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:52:27
he was only undercover on SR using names like nob, french maid and deathfromabove
when interacting with magic the gathering online exchange he wasnt undercover at all
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:02:14
Put money in, get tears out
@_date: 2015-03-18 07:28:21
Eh these fake ones are funny.
@_date: 2015-03-09 11:46:22
Fact: if Governments were concerned about bitcoin, they'd just create their own damn coin.
@_date: 2015-03-09 11:50:21
use [Uneddit]( then
@_date: 2015-03-20 08:24:43
yeah like how the ussr and prc got rid of most of their police
@_date: 2015-03-09 22:18:32
what math
building a cult around math is still a cult
@_date: 2015-03-20 10:41:08
Middle man seems pretty useful here.
Client obviously didn't know which superheros were best suited for the job, which one was currently available, or even their contact info.
Thanks Middle Man!
Without you, client could have wasted valuable minutes which might have meant the death of his wife.
@_date: 2015-02-05 12:20:41
He did, but that wasn't part of the charges in this case. He'll get tried for that in a few months.
@_date: 2015-03-09 11:48:26
CK here so I can't speak about Shadowcast, but if I were you I'd be worried about the NDA.
@_date: 2015-03-09 11:11:16
nah, a dictionary attack can get through those relatively easily
@_date: 2015-03-03 11:02:28
Ugh the only relevant Magic is Earvin Johnson Jr.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:40:34
herbs such as cyanide
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:38:52
To be fair, the murder trial hasn't started yet.
But providing cyanide and meth isn't exactly white collar.
@_date: 2015-03-18 08:57:26
also worse than cash
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:51:59
except its not relevant
@_date: 2015-03-31 12:17:40
hes white
his family does have a military history tho
@_date: 2015-03-31 11:47:48
if the corrupt government was behind it why the hell would they arrest force &amp; bridges
gov employees =/= government
