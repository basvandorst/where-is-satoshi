If you're a yankee its a dumb idea, i doubt hiring a lawyer they would even advise a loophole if there was one.
If you're not though, it sounds lucrative. Just saying.

Does it work in any public subreddit (i assume private are unwatchable as are PM's so dont work, i assume bitcointipbot stalks every subreddit, or does it watch people who sign up and watches their comments from the users I signed up for an account and redeemed karma, so theres a whole bitcent waiting for your explanation. ;P
I'm hoping this will be a nice way to sell steam codes over reddit.

But is there a contingency plan for it?
If it gets deleted does there still exist outside of the reddit account system a backup, and this can be deployed to a new account with no loss of records, or would the ban result in the loss of transaction data and thus loss of BTC for some/all users?

What did pirateat40 do then? Did he turn that investment thing (it was an investment wasn't it? that he bet someone 5000BTC over...) into a big scam?
How much did he screw people for?

Ditto, i'd buy a month if you enabled bitcoin, coins here just sitting waiting for something digital to spend on. What better than reddit.

How does that shit work? Yeah i saw the launch of the tool, but didn't read up what was involved.
Do you have a plugin or software running on your machine? Something that actually initiates a wallet transfer based on your typed instructions within Reddit?
@_date: 2012-10-13 02:22:27
Its so simple! Why didn't i think of that?

The best use for bitcoin in my opinion, no hassling with plastic or banks, straight donations however much you want. Digital cash for digital content. We need this.

I think you just hit the nail on the head as to why this could be a very successful cryptocurrency business.
Some wierd kinks just validate bitcoin.

What a smart pro-active move, if they take the plunge.
I have always loved the idea of Flattr but i dont want to use plastic on any web service. 
If i could get bitcoins elsewhere and charge Flattr with them, well that usurps any future bitcoin style version of Flattr, is more widely supported and convenient for me and bloggers (Etc) and ensures they still get a cut.
They'd be mad not to accept bitcoin.

Thats my reddit tipbot address. Anything that ends up in there will go to tipping out insightful posters.

Iranian people are not exactly the enemy, even by the US standards. The government and its economy are the target.
People ditching rial for btc would only destabilise the rial further which would still be in the US interest. Meanwhile the iranian cipherpunk can actually save some money up.

What if tipbot gets banned, how will that affect your operation/balances of that of your or the tipped persons reddit account/wallet?
@_date: 2012-11-08 15:25:01
I liked the statement about being DRM-free and about supporting the artist. I do see bitcoin as being something that will empower individual content creators in time, and its great to see another store making steps towards that.

I think an average Joe will see the mint as something required to counterbalance the notes taken out of circulation.
Is the video is trying to make a point about devaluing currency through quantitive easing? Is the average joe going to understnd the point?

Should have checked yesterday when i x-posted the post to - i guess an evangelist or no i'm too late for this train but thanks for doing this OP! I hope reddit gets a big surge of bitcoin paid gold purchases over the coming days...

National press, wide readership, interesting also that they were aware of the reddit/wordpress adoptions too. Shame they never hinted at where you would procure your own bitcoins from, but as articles go it was very positive.
