LN hasn't evolved to the point where we can say how centralized it will be. I think a lot of people have some really unrealistic expectations based on misunderstandings of how the collateral works, and how it will inevitably relate to bitcoin transfer fees, which will always be throttled by a low data cap. It's not a problem right now, but the fact that it's coming is patently obvious, if you understand how the thing works...
@_date: 2018-05-17 13:39:38
A lot of us still think LN sucks, actually. I don’t think anyone was ever claiming that you can’t leverage central hubs to collateralize txns as a 3rd party metalayer, just that it would be fucking stupid to do that, which it still is.

That's not what I meant by hack. What I meant by hack is that the software is being redesigned to lie to old clients about what's going on. It's a hack in the truest sense.

Sure we can force them. Start a crowd fund to bankroll a new mining pool that will pay its miners slightly better than they should be able to. If a significant fraction of miners start leaving old pools for the new pool - which only exists because the old mining pools are pissing everyone off, I expect they would acquiesce.

Price change was probably mostly caused by the etf rejection. Just because it rebounded for 3 days doesn't mean that didn't matter, it just means there were a lot of people hoping to buy the first dip.
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:24:41
I believe the reason they sometimes mine empty blocks has to do with knowlege that a competitor found a block but hasn't released it yet (for a few seconds- they get this info by sniffing the other mining pools for changes in the seed) then they happen to find a new block within those few seconds, but have no way of knowing which txns were in the unreleased block, so they include none.

@_date: 2017-03-07 23:57:21
Yeah, but they're a hash - if you haven't told everyone what the transactions are that you hashed, they can't verify - which is exactly the point. A competitor found a block , we know that because they told all their miners to start looking for a new one with 'this seed', we believe them, rather than wait for them to release the block and verify the new seed, and we find another block in those few seconds (it happens occasionally...) well, we had no way to include any transactions, because we still don't know which ones are in their block, so as soon as they release their block, we'll release ours, and it's empty.
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:24:47
What a stupid quote. The block size is a necessary component, there's data that needs to be stored - it had to have some size. The size was arbitrary small to minimize risk of bloat early in the blockchain history when transactions cost nothing. There's no reason 3 transactions per second is better than 20, although past about 20 the blocks would be large enough to cause problems for the china firewall... 
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:36:42
They're not compressing anything you idiot. They're just hacking non updated clients so they can't see the witness hashes. The blocks are actually larger than 1 mb, you're just not actually validating the blockchain anymore. Your 'full node' on an old client might as well be an electrum wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:43:47
They're not really related, but they're sort of incompatible. The reason you can't have both is that BU changes the size of the blocks, and if blocks ever got large enough you could attack the great firewall of china with them (IE chinese miners won't be able to keep up with the blockchain) Right now that line is at about 8mb blocks, but if we implement segwit that line moves to 2 mb blocks, because segwit blocks can be artificially constructed to be 4x larger than the current max size (these would not naturally occur larger than 1.5x or so, 4x would be an attack)

1mb was a totally arbitrary number... and it's obviously too low now. You can scale the chain with 3rd party solutions and have very few on chain transactions, but there's no real advantage to having so few - except that you don't need a hardfork, which would cause drama, but then again it's causing drama anyway, so ... whatever.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:40:39
If you were going to do a hard fork then segwit is a hack job, you should scrap it and do something with less technical debt. The whole point of segwit is to address multiple unrelated problems without having to hardfork.

21 million was an equally arbitrary number, although it's really more like 21 million * 10^8. The difference is there would be no advantage to changing that number. If it had been a much smaller number, like 21 million satoshis instead of 21 * 10^14 satoshis we would want to increase that number too, because only 21 million people would have been able to use the network otherwise...

There are a few seconds between when a mining company finds a block and when it's released to the network, the first thing they do is tell all of their miners to start working with the new seed (by including the block you've found that no one else knows about yet) their competitors notice that they've told all their miners what the new seed is, so they start working off that seed too - even though they can't validate it yet. But to start working they can't include any transactions, because they don't know which ones have already been picked up (because the only information they have about the secret block is the necessary information to start mining the next one) If they happen to find the next block very quickly, there's nothing to do except release a block with no transactions included.

It wasn't 'the Chinese' it was people using Chinese exchanges. There are a lot of people trying to get their coins of of those exchanges, and they can't. It looks like if they want to they're going to have to show a paper trail of where they got the money to buy them in the first place, and give an explanation of what they want to do with the bitcoins instead of yuan, as well as proof of identity. It's a horrific direction for a country that's a major player in the bitcoin economy to be pursuing.
Hardforks were never a 'threat', they're just optional software changes. But if what you mean is BU probably isn't going to be a thing... I don't know why you think that. Also BTClassic just came back from the dead and announced they're hardforking with a mergemine (so keeping the history...) so yeah, hardforks are going to be a thing, if that bothers you.
SolidX was likely going to be rejected, but it was a stronger proposal because it tied value to multiple exchanges rather than a single one. That makes it marginally disappointing, but yes, not nearly as disappointing as the first one.

The price is significantly lower than before the rejection of the ETF... allow me to proffer a counter narrative - the etf hype and attention pulled the price to a new all time high , the rejection was largely anticipated so lots of money was waiting in the wings , a dip was bought and delusional euphoria set in for 4 days (cue first 3 pages of sub reddit being nothing but circle jerk price recovery posts) price takes huge nose dive for 'no reason' which may or may not have bottomed out 4 days ago.

I have a quick question for a bitcoin developer and this is the only technical thread I could find. Sorry for being off topic.
I would like to know how the blockchain determines when a block is found (Not in which order it is found, I understand that) Since the difficulty is adjusted by an expected interval of 5 minutes, how does the network know that 5 minutes has passed. It's not as though the protocol has an internal system clock , and if it's relying on my computer's system clock for a time stamp... I could just fake that, right? What am I missing here.
@_date: 2017-01-18 11:16:29
No one is talking about what I thought was the most sinister part of the warnings. "Stop offline advertising" sounds innocuous enough, but here's what it means: last time China tried to crack down on wire transfers into exchanges, the exchanges started selling gift cards in grocery stores, basically impossible to watch over. This is what regulators would like to stop.
@_date: 2017-01-10 18:04:26
As far as I can tell, we do not know if the money comes from China. What we do know is that more bitcoin are traded on Chinese exchanges, but they have no trade fees, so obviously a lot of non chinese want to use their exchanges. We also do not know how many BTC are being traded on those exchanges (was that the same 100 btc 6 times or 6 people with 100 btc each, no way to tell.) The most popular explanation I know for the status quo is that it's left intentionally mercureal so the capital flight can be obfuscated both from the chinese government and from market speculators.

Actually, they're using software to make sure their buys and sells arrive at the same time for the same price, which no one else has. It's called wash trading, they do it to lower withdrawl fees , which are cheaper if you trade more bitcoin. The point was always to hide the actual volume. It is wholly illegitiment.

No such thing as signaling with hardforks. You release it into the wild and everyone takes it, or the community fractures. In our case the community would fracture 3 ways, so fuck that.
BU and BTC-C are hardfork solutions, there shouldn't be any real technical problems with that, just political, and we can debate the merits of their partial scaling solutions.
Hardforking segwit makes no sense, the whole point is that it's a hacky solution to a handful of unrelated problems that will not require a hardfork. The technical debt is much lower with other solutions. (It's not all about transaction capacities people...) but the political situation is untenable. I am anti hardfork for non protocol breaking issues at this stage in the network's maturity. (to be honest, 5 transactions per second is perfectly fine for a store of value, and that matters right now. You want microtransactions, use a third party till developement makes that feasible on chain-side chain-alt coin- whatever...)
@_date: 2017-01-18 11:20:43
Once bitcoin saps the symbolic power of the state and we all feel confidient that a coorperation can mediate microtransactions off chain without the government crawling up their ass, then we can talk chargebacks.
Of course, that won't really be bitcoin. But we'll be able to sort of retreat into bitcoin if necessary, which I would argue is all that really matters.
@_date: 2017-01-28 23:39:50
This is not quite what I was asking, although there is a lot of useful information in your reply that I can use to ask the question better. What I was asking was actually 'Why am I not able to manipulate my own timestamp to screw with difficulty adjustment if I'm the one finding the new blocks' I believe I found the answer in the source code for BTCv 0.8 "// Threshold for nLockTime: below this value it is interpreted as block number, otherwise as UNIX timestamp.
static const int LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD = 500000000; // Tue Nov 5 00:53:20 1985 UTC"
I believe this is a way of saying , 'Take their timestamp, whatever it is, so long as it's not backwards in time more than a certain threshold.'
In peercoin source this is much easier to read, because it's just
static const int64 nMaxClockDrift = 2 * 60 * 60; // two hours
Does that sound about right?
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:04:59
Drip outside via orphaned blocks? Is he saying the transaction fees somehow get burned if a block is orphaned? That can't be true right? Like... I find a block, your transaction has 1 confirm. Someone else found 2 blocks and overwrite my block, now your transaction is invalidated(and will be picked up by someone else later). But somehow your transaction fee has been anihilated?
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:38:54
Contentious hard forking your immutible ledger for a trivial scalability enhancement is stupid. Small transactions will be handled by third parties or side chains or alt coins or any number of solutions that don't involve a contentious hard fork.
Also, there's no urgency to solve this problem. If the fees go up while the technology matures, whatever. Doubt they will, though. most of the network's current transactions are spam, and they won't pay a slightly higher fee because they don't actually care if the money moves. 
@_date: 2017-01-29 08:45:56
Competition is sure to happen eventually, but that just means you're going to have more targeted use cases. Bitcoin can't be the new gold, and the way you buy coffee. Not today, maybe in the future, if we find real technical solutions to these scaling problems. These (hardforks) are not those solutions, these aren't a step in the right direction. This is a pure trade off of twice as difficult to keep running nodes for twice as many transactions, we can do better, and we will eventually. Stop panicking. If anyone comes up with a really good idea, I'm sure we could galvanize the community around hardforking to it. These ideas just suck, is all. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 23:48:41
The community would like infinite transactions per second, sure. 3 TPS is reasonable currently if you're willing to pay 20 cents worth of bitcoin on each transaction. As the network continues to grow, that will be a force driving up that price. As people become unwilling to make small purchases on chain for higher fees, that will be a force driving down that price. The backbone of bitcoin must remain a store of value, you can build your ecosystem for everything else around that. Without that you've got nothing.
There is no urgency to solve this problem. If it gets really bad and we have $100 equivalent fees... well, then maybe there is an urgency to solve this problem. No reason to think that's about to happen, no reason to fracture the community into 3 pieces today.

Not sure that makes any sense. What's supposed to be the difference between an internal stake of $200,000 and an external stake of $200,000 worth of infrastructure. You'd still be shooting yourself in the foot by attacking the network.
It's not clear why validating several hard forks of the same blockchain , (though it wouldn't cost you much of anything) would be a problem for the network security. In fact ... it wouldn't, so ... who cares? Unless you're making a slippery slope argument that because it's marginally profitable (1% per year...) large stake holders would instigate infinite contentious hardforks and undermine the legitimacy of any one of them. Which sounds dumb.

At okcoin you can't withdraw bitcoin. (You also probably can't withdraw outside of China) at bitfinex you can't withdraw USD, but you can withdraw bitcoin. It makes perfect sense, no need for conspiracy theories. It's a hedge against the exchange being in bad standing and not revealing it yet. Otherwise, they'll eventually reenable these withdrawals, and the price will equalize.

The network is in a position where it can be compromised by a whim of the Chinese government to seize a handful of warehouses and mine only empty blocks. Economies of scale has created a tragedy of the commons situation, proof of work doesn't scale securely. We should switch to PoW/PoS hybrid if we want a decentralized network... and we do. Cryptocurrency is antifragile , but first mover advantage is not an antifragile property. We need to adapt or change platforms.
@_date: 2017-04-23 15:22:54
It's two problems. First, USD withdrawals have been suspended, driving the price up as people lose confidence that the exchange will fix its problems. The only way to get your money out is to pay a premium, the same logic is why the price is so low on OKCoin.
The second problem is that any short position is being destroyed by that situation, driving the price up even further. But, the huge variance also encourages people with confidence in the exchange's eventual good standing to drop bitcoins into it an sell them at today's high price. So, ultimately you can take the variance as a measure of the market's bearishness on the eventual good standing of the exchange. Higher being worse. In other words, the market is nervous about Finex, and even more nervous about Okcoin.

They wouldn't suspend crypto withdrawals, unless of course their corporation was subpoenaed by the government of Hong Kong threatening to put them in jail if they continued allowing crypto withdrawals because they're suspected of something fraudulent.
The more stress their business is under, the more likely that outcome becomes.
Or they aren't actually a non fractional reserve and just said they were... much like gox.

The new narrative is that segwit isn't about scaling, it's about second layer solutions. It's just some crap to hype about. litecoin has no more to do with segwit than any of the other altcoins with segwit.

A few guys with guns pointing them at who? There's nothing to localize the stake holders. POW localizes the miners by factors like access to specialized hardware manufacturing, cheap electricity, cheap storage costs. What localizes people who own a currency? Sure, you could attack the exchanges, although that shouldn't get you 51% (if it would that's a problem) but large holders remove their coins from exchanges anyway so that they can mint with them...
The only real problem with POS is the initial distribution phase, which is addressed properly the way Peercoin addressed it. Gradual switch over to Proof of Stake.

Even antonopolous is saying the mining monopoly is a threat now... time to hedge with altcoins

Why do you need to reverse anything, can't we just conclude from the fact that they're using 0 transaction blocks that they must have a reason for not including transactions, and that that reason is probably a mining exploit...
I do know of another reason, but it only applies to blocks found within a few seconds of each other, and that doesn't seem to be the case.

There's nothing wrong with them keeping bitcoin chain history and launching a mergemine alt coin just like xt... in fact, it's free stuff for us all. At the end of the day this will have been a fight about naming rights.
We've fallen far from our cryptoanarchist roots... so, so very far.
Smash the state, bros.

I don't see how UASF is not a hard fork. If you change your software to stop accepting things the rest of the network does accept ... why shouldn't you just get two networks, one where people go with your rebellion, and one where people roll their eyes and ignore you.
In fact, if that happened you might end up in a situation where each network gets half the hashing power - crippling the transaction network for months while the difficulty readjusts.
How is this not a hardfork?

Btc-e always had problems with USD exchange, it was sort of the premise from the outset... a legal grey exchange for people who want less red tape.
Okcoin isn't allowing bitcoin withdraws, which brings the price of bitcoin on their exchange down. This is entirely consistent. They don't allow USD withdraws, but they do allow fiat withdraws.
Finex, stamp, and coinbase continuing to increase in variance is something to be concerned with though. I think it represents confidence that the issue will eventually be solved.

This is stupid. The majority of mining profitability has nothing to do with electricity, because no one who isn't in a special situation for electricity would have chosen to participate as a big player. It has everything to do with hardware and recouping the cost of your hardware before entropy takes it back. They're not going to simply 'shut off' their miners, unless they are bankrupt, and they don't go bankrupt the second the price tanks. They sold the bitcoins they expected to mine this month last month as a contract.
The current drop in hash rate is caused by hashes going to other tokens.

It makes perfect sense if you consider that people are opening up large leveraged short positions now that we've broken some TA indicators. The market can move slightly against leveraged shorts and pop up 5% even if it wants to do nothing but jump off a cliff.

If you think the halvening actually matters, than you by definition think the price is too low right now. You can not simultaneously justify "It doesn't matter if the price drops, because unprofitable miners will just shut off." and "The price will need to increase when the halvening comes to keep miners profitable."

Hey guess what, how many people are using it isn't the largest variable determining price right now, turns out. Is bitcoin as imbedded into the world as exxon? No, not even close, obviously, no one uses it for anything but speculation. Well, they have the same aggregate value, so bitcoin's probably massively overpriced. Public image of bitcoin right now is that it's the thing that all those people who got rich overnight bought - that kind of image can flip pretty fast into 'that cooky scheme that all those suckers who got scammed bought' and it turns out public image matters when your entire valuation is based on speculation.
Let's assume that bitcoin has the potential to have 100 times more utility value at the cost of its speculative value... bitcoin is still overpriced. Wake me up when the mania is over.

Bitcoin is the trojan horse that kills fiat. If they try to kill it the way you're imagining the value will just bleed into the alt market as precisely that utility emerges there.

This doesn't even make sense. He owes 50k on the trade where he made money. Then he lost all the money on another trade. That means he owes nothing. He profited nothing. You can declare losses too you know....

It would be difficult to figure out what kind of volume moves through which exchanges, due to all the wash trading. I suppose you could estimate it by placing many large orders and doing a regression analysis on how they were filled, but that would cost a lot.
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:26:30
Absolutely moronic, unless you think the dollar collapses by 2020. 20 trillion dollars of aggregate value in bitcoin would currently represent a fourth of the aggregate value of all things. Come back to reality and profit from this hysteria instead of getting sucked into it.
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:27:27
Yeah, I get that, my point is that any serious player in the mining game is likely to have an unfair advantage. For instance, if I could siphon electricity off the company I work for, which a lot of people are in a position to do, I wouldn't mind buying an S9.

As exciting as anonymous universal currency is, it's not a healthy ecosystem for business if it hyper deflates. In the long run it won't grow like a business.
