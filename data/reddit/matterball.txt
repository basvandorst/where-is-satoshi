You need bigger balls if you buy while the price is trending down. If MtGox doesn't take the money and run, then you'll probably be fine, eventually. But no one can predict the future.
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:42:19
Obviously it's MtGox's fault. Or at least that's what I've been hearing.

Invalid reasoning. He's basically saying "I'll believe what I want unless you prove to me otherwise" when there is not enough information to be confident he did steel the coins, or that a hacker stole the coins, or possibly some other situation. If they were stolen by someone else, then pretending Mark stole them will just the give thief an easy get-away.
Not that I want to defend Mark. Even if he didn't steal the coins, I hope he ends up in jail forever, or worse because there **is** evidence of some wrong-doing which led to the current situation. But there's so much misinformation and bullshit spread around r/bitcoin it's frustrating filtering out the retarded crap.... I don't know why I bother....   I guess I keep coming back hoping it will be that rare instance where some actual useful information shows up that I don't want to miss.

No. I'm being downvoted because the hivemind will hate on anything MtGox.

The Bitcoin Core Developers wrote the bitcoin core library for everyone to use. It's here: 
It's contributors are here:
Here is the discussion on how to fix transaction malleability:
MtGox, like most other exchanges, use this software. MtGox did not write it.

No. Your analogy aligns the programmer with the one who chose to use the txid as the unique identifier. Which is not MtGox. Bitstamp and BTC-e, had the same txid issue because they all used the same open source software which none of them wrote themselves.
This is not hard to understand yet you seem to be having trouble with it. Hopefully software development is not your career choice.

Why would you say I don't understand the issue? I clearly understand the issue better than you do. And here's something to help educate yourself, though I doubt you'd understand what they're talking about: 
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:24:09
No. These accounts were always compromised the owners didn't realize it. MtGox just started sending out login notification emails.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:52:12
I wouldn't trust you with anything.

Notify Equifax and TransUnion to have them put an alert on your credit file. It costs a $5 bucks for each. You have to do it on both. If you're really worried, it might be worth it to pay for their monitoring service but it's like $15/mo each.
Also let your bank and credit card companies know directly as well.

Downvote me all you want. I'm not wrong.

Profit margin is 99%.
You're thinking markup.
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:59:35
Either hackers stole them or Mark stole them. Either way, why isn't there effort in locating those stolen coins?
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:26:14
MtGox turned on login email notifications. These accounts claiming they were just hacked were compromised a long time ago. They are only now finding out because of this security feature.
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:39:00


Exactly. MtGox isn't the programmer. Glad we finally resolved this argument.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:49:45
... further evidence you don't understand.
It does explain my position. But I don't expect you to understand why.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:36:39
No. "Real" exchanges have plenty of glitches to the point of shutting down, too. A couple recent ones:
MtGox's entire operation is not even a fart in the wind compared to the time and money behind those systems.
Though, at least with the existing systems if something goes wrong they can just enter in whatever number they want for your balance. It's all just numbers in databases. With bitcoin, once a bitcoin is lost, it's lost forever.
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:42:18
Proof of ID is needed to reduce fraud. Other bitcoin exchanges have gone under because they lost too much money due to bank fraud.

Maybe the impression that the bitcoin community is full of jerks perpetuates because the bitcoin community **IS** full of jerks (as demonstrated here).
Jerks are going to be jerks and you can't change them, so what's the point?
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:00:23
No, that is not a good assumption.
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:31:00
Hopefully there will be more than just thieves left with bitcoins by that point.

Datsuns suck. Nissan's the way to go!

Nah, I'm sure he'll pull a Trump and just not pay anyone. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 00:53:01
~~Wrong!~~ 
@_date: 2016-11-08 01:44:00
Too subtle I guess. I was supposed to be in Trump's voice. You know, on account of him always saying "wrong" for things that aren't wrong. It's a meme.

Left the door unlocked??? Oh jeez.. come on.... Not even close.
Left it locked but on the street of a bad neighborhood and $10k in the trunk, *maaaybe*. But I'd still wonder how they got in without breaking the window. Maybe it *was* a flaw in Ford's keyless entry keypad. In which case, I *would* have to blame Ford.
And I'm sure he'll go ahead and take "respectability" for himself......

I've been meaning to enable 2FA for a while now and just haven't done it. Thanks for the kick in the pants. I went and enable it just now.
