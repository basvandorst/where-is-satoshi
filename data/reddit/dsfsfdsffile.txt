If you send a large enough wire transfer to bitstamp.net it might cost less.. depends what your bank charges to convert to USD.. but probably only around 3% + some fixed fee (which will be a smaller percentage the more you send).

I guess non-segwit miners can continue to produce old-style blocks as long as they lie about them being segwit.. of course they have to exclude any segwit transactions in case they accidentally violate the new rules.

No not really. paypal isn't a good way to buy.. maybe if you have a good friend they can help you out, otherwise visa/mastercard is better, although bank transfer is best.. maybe try a different bank or credit union.

well the problem might be I suppose that mining is so profitable for bitmain that it allows them to indulge in sub-optimal activity.. at least for some time.. that may not be the case, but it might not be inaccurate either.

You do not want less electricity consumption.. you want a simple un-gameable no shortcuts method of measuring and proving how much electricity was sacrificed. There needs to be an ongoing cost. Ideally the hardware would be cheap and an insignificant part of the cost so that it's easy for anyone to start mining.. maybe even at a loss or cost neutral in terms of return on electricity so that there's less incentive to run huge mining farms.
AFAIK there is no way to force miners to validate or store the entire blockchain.
For pool mining, I do think that shorter block periods like litecoin's allow for slightly more pools 
 than longer periods like bitcoin's.. more blocks up for grabs - so it can support slightly more pools. I don't think you can scale this much though. The bitcoin weak-blocks idea could perhaps also address this in a slightly different way.
I don't think there's anything that can be done about botnets either.. although if the mining ASICs are so much faster than CPUs or GPUs it probably won't be a big problem. 
I doubt there is any hardware that's readily available that couldn't be monopolised.. the world is so centralised and many things are only made in a very small number of factories.

Why do you say that? The miners would make more immediately short term as well by supporting segwit.. it isn't just long term.. imo they probably will support it in the end, they just want to drag this out and cause chaos in the meantime.

kraken used to allow it, but seems not anymore.. maybe try bitstamp.net or zyado.com, also okpay.com works with SWIFT and allows you to use btc-e.com and maybe some other exchanges.. similarly cryptocapital.co is another wallet that has connectivity to several bitcoin exchanges and supports SWIFT.

well if the miners are really finding it profitable to block segwit that's fine.. and actually they probably are.. the short term chaos it creates would be great for making trading gains.. but ultimately I expect they will adopt segwit.. I'm not telling them to do that, but I expect it will happen.. maybe I'm wrong.. time will tell.
@_date: 2017-04-19 15:39:05
Well if you're willing to rely on magic then sure do whatever :p
There will never be equal access to hardware.. some people will always be able to buy more than others just as they can buy more electricity. The electricity cost will never be zero.. if it is very cheap then people will be able to sacrifice lots of it. That's fine.
Ultimately electricity production cost is pretty similar around the world.. the places where it is cheap it is only cheap because of government subsidies.. if people start sacrificing loads of subsidised electricity you can be sure the subsidies will be stopped, or the mining activity criminalised and shut down by force. It's not perfectly equal obviously, but nothing is.
Hashing against blockchain data doesn't force miners to keep the chain, as they could just query it on demand from their peers.. but still it might not be a bad idea.. I suspect miners are just being lazy and if they are forced to think about it a bit maybe they'll be more likely to do the right thing.

BTU don't exist, but some exchanges (bitfinex) are trading them anyway.. ie, you deposit BTC and get both BTC and BTU.. although you can't withdraw either until in the future when BTU exists.. if it never exists I guess the bitfinex BTU will eventually be worthless... although I suppose the fact that anyone could fork off a BTU at any time and the fact that people have already bought BTU makes it quite likely that it will eventually be created, even if it's basically dead on arrival simply because.. well why not, and if you don't then your BTU would have to go to zero, so might as well spin off another shitcoin.

there is also fire.com - based in ireland that has both IBAN and UK faster payments.. I haven't tried this, but it seems like it might be a good option.. also maybe bunq.com (based in the netherlands).
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:26:02
imo none of them are particularly great.. the best way to deal with btc in the UK is to open an EUR bank account and trade with that on kraken, bitstamp or zyado. You can get EUR accounts from lloyds, hsbc/firstdirect, barclays and probably others.. also for buying  is quite useful as it allows very inexpensive conversion of GBP to EUR.. but unfortunately has no way to receive EUR back so you might still want to open an EUR bank account elsewhere anyway. Moving money between your EUR account and GBP can be done using transferwise or currencyfair quite cheaply and receiving EUR from a bitcoin exchange to an EUR account is normally very cheap or free.
That said   and  can all deal with GBP (by SWIFT bank transfer - so you'll have fixed fee transfer fees, but no fx percentage based fees).. cex.io also works with credit/debit cards for both buying and selling (ie, they can push GBP to your current account through your visa debit card). The fees for doing this seem reasonable, but whenever I check the actual prices for BTC on cex.io they don't seem that attractive.
edit: another good place to get an EUR account might be 
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:52:42
You can't really cash out into fidor as they only accept UK faster payment deposits, not SEPA. fidor is good for buying, but as you noticed, not with coinbase.. try kraken.com, bitstamp.net or zyado.com instead.. none of these require microdeposits for verification. Eventually fidor will probably add ibans, but who knows when. In the meantime I would recommend opening an EUR account at lloyds, barclays, natwest, hsbc/firstdirect and use that to cash out of one of the EUR exchanges mentioned above. Once you have EUR in your own account, you can convert it back to GBP using transferwise or currencyfair. You could also sell BTC on localbitcoins and have the money deposited to fidor by faster payments.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:11:34
There's fidorbank.uk, revolut.com, monzo.com, fire.com, bunq.com, ipagoo.com to name a few. I think fire and bunq might be better for cashing out BTC as they have EUR accounts with IBANs and there are far more exchanges that support EUR than GBP. On the other hand, you can get more money by selling on localbitcoins albeit more risky.

There is no point in making a BU/segwit combination client.. I mean maybe there is some point for BU to add segwit to their client, because they still need to fix tx malleability - but the old bitcoin blockchain will roll on without any hardforks.. maybe a hardfork can also gain some traction, but probably never more than the original.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:18:24
I mentioned a few in your [previous thread]( - but none of these support bitcoin directly.. and I dont think there are any that do.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:28:09
A good rule of thumb is to take 100% of your cash and put it all into BTC.. then max out credit cards and other lines of credit to try and keep it above 100% as long as possible, cashing out only to buy the bare minimum required for food and optionally rent, although living in a cardboard box might be worth it during the summer months just to help get that little bit extra BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:12:03
1) I think that would work well (using fidor to buy and cashing out using revolut).
2) If you want to withdraw, you need an IBAN - so it knows where to send the money. It doesn't require an IBAN to deposit though (which is why fidor works for deposits). Coinbase requires you to withdraw some verification payments from coinbase first before you can deposit using the same account.. these other exchanges do not require that, you can just deposit straight away. They will check that the wire transfer sender name matches what you signed up with, which apparently causes a problem with revolut since they don't put your name in the name field - but fidor does. For withdrawals it shouldn't matter I don't think, so you can probably withdraw to revolut and deposit from fidor. I think it should work ok.

imo yes it will.. there's probably little doubt that some miners will do the HF.. but will it be any more relevant than the aug 1st  HF or the already existing  HF? It's hard to see why it would be. BTX tokens trade at a much lower price than BTC... if the same happens with segwit2x coin how long will the miners persist in mining it? I expect massive dumping of the HF coins from existing holders too.. maybe in favour of bitcoin but a safe option would just be to dump for USD or maybe LTC or some other non-bitcoin related asset.
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:18:52
Their [comparison site]( suggests they charge 2.5% for GBP to BTC.. localbitcoins is about 4.5%. Not the cheapest, but a good combination of less expensive than lbc and easy.
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:27:49
imo it's a done deal for aug 1st, but there might still be a fight in mid november over the HF part. If enough hash power defects to the 2MB side of the HF it could possibly drag SPV clients along with it creating chaos.

I think technically the tx fee should immediately attract capital gains tax (just on the amount of gain on the amount of the fee).. but it's a tiny amount so I doubt anyone would care. Perhaps you could avoid it by including a new utxo of recently bought BTC to pay the fee with :p

That is what I meant, yes. Perhaps it could become relevant in the future when we're paying $100 tx fees, but probably not even then as it would just be the gains on the $100.. so if you had BTC from 2009 maybe you could owe $20 in CGT or something ;)

usually they have per transaction limits.. they may also require a mobile phone number and limit the amount per number per day.. maybe  the fees vary from around 5% to 15%. The amounts depend on the individual machine.

It is possible to inject stuff into the tcp protocol.. so that when the bitcoin node requests a block, the get block command fails instead of returning a block. That's the kind of thing they're talking about.. tbh I don't really think these hijack attacks are a major threat.. they're certainly possible, but hijacking 150 prefixes you might get away with once or twice, but pretty soon your peers are going to notice and cut you off.. and how much damage can you do in that short time? Split the network for a while and then it re-converges again later.. maybe you get away with a doublespend in that time.. I dunno I guess it could be bad, but then again you might get caught. A much bigger concern is passive surveillance.. the fact that wiretapping 4 ISPs allows you to see the origin IP of every bitcoin transaction is a major blow to privacy.. nodes should definitely implement p2p encryption.. even though it mitms can still happen it kills passive surveillance.

Full nodes are basically altruistic yea.. some people may have them for blockchain analytics or because they need to accept payments for their business and want to integrate a proper full node, but mostly they are just run for fun by hobbyists. This is why increasing the blocksize is a bad idea.. the more the cost to run a full node rises above what people can scrounge from the junk bin or the cost of a barebones vps, the less people will run them.
If you start drawing massive amounts of power then whoever does pay your bills is going to notice.. maybe they won't be able to do anything about it right away, but it probably isn't what they signed up for when they agreed to give you 'free' electricity. ASICs also generate a lot of heat and noise, which may make it unpleasant to have in your house, or in any space where people have to coexist or cause a much larger electrical cost in the form of air conditioning.
That said, yea.. if you buy the latest ASIC and run it for free you'll probably at least make your money back.. there is also the problem that they're all mostly sold out though :p

The only way to fix transaction malleability is to move the signature/witness out of the txid calculation.. as a result any malleability fix would probably look very similar to segwit.. that they also managed to get an effective blocksize increase out of it is a nice little bonus that doesn't add much complexity.

I suppose that in the future most transactions will transition over to segwit transactions.. so I don't think it makes a difference.. it's just a smooth switchover instead of an abrupt and disruptive one. If there really is anyone who wants to use bitcoin as before they still can.. perhaps some paper wallet users for instance may continue to hold their paper wallets for years to come.

probably coinfloor.co.uk or safello.com - but imo it's better not to trade in uk pounds.. instead use fidorbank.uk to buy on EUR markets instead. fidor allows SEPA transfers for £2.49 and has very efficient GBP to EUR conversion (around half a percent). fire.com may also be good.

EUR transfers are very cheap (free in many cases) and there are several liquid EUR exchanges - kraken, bitstamp, zyado, itbit, gatecoin etc.. whereas in GBP the only way to move it is via SWIFT transfer which attracts annoying fees sometime on both ends at once. Because of this, few people trade in GBP and thus there are few liquid GBP markets so no incentive to start trading there. It's a chicken and egg problem. coinfloor has reasonable liquidity, but not great (something like 300BTC/day?) and it's the only orderbook exchange supporting GBP at the moment.. using EUR has more options and is cheaper for buying amounts under about £3k due to the 0.5% fx fee for conversion to EUR vs a £10 sending fee and a £5 deposit fee on coinfloor's end (15/3000 = 0.5%). If you're buying more than that, coinfloor might work out better.. but then again it might not if the price there is higher which it often is.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:12:36
well that's true.. except the amounts are so low as to be useless.. like your pocket change is worth more than you'll ever get this way and probably you would not even accumulate enough to pay the fee to transfer it to your own wallet.
