I use Circle and Coinbase. I also use bitcoinbender to transfer to DNM. It works. But I am a noobie. The vendor I worked with advised me. Easy process.

Oh snap. Thank you. How do people do this?! "Tumble"? LOL Oh you gotta love nooooobiezzzzzzz. I hate to be a pain but I want to make sure I cover my bases.

Where can I find my bitcoin address in Nucleus to transfer funds from Circle to Nucleus for a purchase?!

I don't care about the joke replies. I am not a fluent criminal so wtfe. I sent coins 2x. One successfully the other not. I am not fluent in precautions associated with the dmns either. simply trying to follow proper/safest possible measures. In researching for the lost coins I researched the helix addy on blockchain and saw the IP addresses with "(who is)" below those IPs. Mental condition for not understanding this shit?  Think that, then scroll on. I have never seen the whois, which in my cyber world means backtracking addresses down to the street address and phone number. Clearly those won't be mine. Just wondering how efficiently the tumbles can be tracked or traced. I don't use drugs either, maybe once every year or two I may partake so nor am I a tweaked out paranoid dumbfuck.but thanks. Have u never been new to anything and needed a more clear understanding or guidance?!!

No I am not. That's what I am saying. It seems like it would be easy from their side. I am shocked markets and vendors last so long. That is impressive to me on the vedor/market side.
@_date: 2016-03-20 20:43:01
I did this. Thanks.

I am trying to assess how badly I could be in trouble. Too long to explain. Last year under different acct I made a purchase. That was June or July last year. Nothing since.
@_date: 2016-03-20 20:43:35
They are on their way.....keep checking......ope, just sent more.....look again.

I sent my coins to a helix address, requested tumble and provided a destination address. My coins never arrived. I looked it up on blockchain. It says current value 0.00. I see the destination addresses, however it is split and none are the final destination I requested. I sent an email to helix support (I think) to gramsteam a few days ago. I still have received no coins and no replies.

There needs to be an online tutorial for safely accessing the sites. FromA-Z, from downloading TOR, buying, tumbling bitcoins, setting up buyer accounts, etc. 
I have wondered about LEOs. I mean don't many pretend to be buyers to gain access. You are supposed to use ur real name and address for delivery. Not everyone can have a decoy address. So are the vendors pgps enough to protect buyers as well? I am lost I guess. 
@_date: 2016-03-19 14:08:13
Never heard of it. Will check it out. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-03-20 14:06:58
Omg. What do I do from here? Delete my accounts on DMN and say bye to funds???
@_date: 2016-03-21 03:08:04
I heard back from grams. The unsuccessful coins were a fake helix. So the IPs are probably really IPS of whoever stoke them. Live and learn. I mean, it tells exactly where the coins ended up. I don't care enuf to try to locate them. Kudos to that dude....all in a days work.
@_date: 2016-03-20 16:50:48
Ew. Never snort. Haven't made a purchase yet...on the account in question. Last year bought weed once under a different account. And laugh but swear for a friend who went thru major surgery for HVAC burns. He was miserable and irritable not working so cldnt get any. So, that makes it worse to me. Around here I see my friends get screwed trying to buy things. Posses me off, dirt bag hustlers. I know I'm a dumbarssss. But that is within 60 months, which I believe is the statute 
@_date: 2016-03-20 16:46:44
No. I used helix. So they shd be done. Used bitcoin-blender once. My funds were never received on helix so tried with BB, it worked quickly. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 13:53:59
My last transaction shows many taints. However the last 5 or so has IP addresses and says (who is) below it. Does this mean LE is tracing? I use tor always but never received some coins thru helix. I may have researched blockchain in reg web by accident. How screwed am I?
@_date: 2016-03-20 20:42:12
I don't know what specific info I can provide without disclosing too much. Sorry for the genuine ignorance. Thanks for your reply. I did this:
Circle ---&gt;Helix or Bitcoin-Blender---&gt;DMN address
The transaction that was successful,  I wanted to see how it should look upon completion so I researched it on blockchain and saw the info I initially stated. I was told that means they can trace all info back to me and I could be in legal trouble. 
I have never ordered from the DMN account the coins were deposited into. Since all of these postings, I reversed the deposit, mixed it and now have it back. However there is still a transaction lost. Helix finally responded a few minutes ago. I provided the info so hopefully they can help me locate the lost coins. 
As far as trouble....or doing something stupid on DMN, last year in June or July just for shits n giggles I did successfully make a purchase on a different account. I still have quite a few coins in there. But I am currently locked out. I accidentally clicked the 2FA and I am not familiar with it. 
Basically I am wondering if any of the above actions can be linked or AT THIS MOMENT I am screwed. If I simply delete my accounts and stay out of that market and all DMNs will I be okay. 
I used to track people online thru the whois site to speak directly with owners/those with ownership in a corporate position. When I see the whois below taint addresses I am asking what that means in reference to tracing and blockchain.
Is this more confusing or have I elaborated enough.
Thanks for ur post.

Thank you 
@_date: 2016-03-22 06:50:37
Okay. To confirm: Circle---&gt;Mycelium--&gt;Market
No need to use Bitcoin-Blender between Circle and Mycelium?
Also, can u explain necessity of 2FA? On droid, I tried APG but am lost. Now locked out of an account. 
Thanks to all of the veterans taking the time to truly help out noobies and not just bash us for lack of knowledge and willingness to learn.

No. Just blended. New tobthe market. Was gonna try a transaction. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 02:50:53
No. That they could be traced to the dmn account, MY dmn....
Thanks for taking the time to reply. I hope this is all silly and I'm paranoid. I don't get on reddit much and even less on DMN...trying to learn proper procedures. I am lost trying to learn 2FA. I managed to create a public and private pgp. 
I did not see on the site where it explained the comments. I will check that out. Thanks again.
