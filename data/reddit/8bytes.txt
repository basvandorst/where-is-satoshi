It's currently too volatile to hold onto for established businesses, this doesn't mean they don't want it. Bitcoiners don't care about the price of bitcoins, it's the ease and security of use that they're after. Both of which are achieved when companies accept bitcoins. Who cares what a company does with their bitcoins? That doesn't concern the consumer.

I certainly didn't say it thrives because of government involvement in any regard. It thrives as a way to purchase goods in a secure manner without the seller knowing the buyers identity. The seller also gets the benefit of not having to deal with banks for fees.
It is undeniable however that the government could shut it down if they wished. I was arguing that they have no incentive to do so.

And countries that try to move away from the us dollar got bombed to oblivion, see Iraq.
*: uhh why the downvotes? The entire reason US entered Iraq was because sadam was attempting to move petrol away from the US dollar.

Isn't that how all smart people feel?
*: It comes from our knowledge that the average person tends to be quite inept, while the very intelligent seem out of our league. So statistically we are part of the smartest people, but compared to the very intelligent we are idiots.

Do you not see the service provided by these third parties? Bitcoins too new for companies to want to invest money developing the infrastructure to accept bitcoin and convert it to fiat(holding bitcoin is obviously a bad idea for businesses).
*: These companies allow people with no knowledge of bitcoins to accept it. This is the advantage, as the populace becomes more knowledgeable and bitcoin becomes more stable, these problems will solve themselves (knowing how to set up a safe wallet, being able to store coins, easier coin &lt;--&gt; fiat).

there's plenty of oss that isn't free as in freedom. like Ubuntu adding Amazon surveillance in a past release, not very free.

Why worry over something you have no power to change. If the nsa wants to kill bitcoin, they can kill it. 
The real question is why would the nsa or any large body want to do this?
Bitcoin fits right in line with government monitoring. Add someones bitcoin address to their already existing profile, and you now have every online transaction for this person all conveniently tracked for you.
The problem is that people think bitcoin == anonymity. Bitcoin can be abused to allow for anonymous purchases, just like paypal and credit cards. However normal use of bitcoin makes it even easier for surveillance agencies to track you vs other types of spending.

Paypal is a nightmere to deal with. There are numerous examples of them freezing accounts and screwing people over. When you try to look for an alternative to paypal, there really aren't any reliable ones other than giving someone your credit card and hoping for the best. Look at the countless cc's that get stolen every day, this alternative also doesn't work. 
This is the problem I have with ecommerce, and bitcoin solves it. It takes cc's and banks out of the picture, which is a large benefit.
*: more specifically, bitcoin puts the power in the developers/consumers hands. If we centralize all our services, that was our choice. If any problems arise from too many people using coinbase, an alternative will be made, we have all the power here.

I don't know enough to comment on whether he scammed his btc or not, however the number is in the [thousands](

You can track how the money get into each address as that information is public. However that is a method for civilians to wrangle with, the nsa or similar bodies can simply use one of the various backdoors they have in every single piece of software and hardware to grab whatever they like.
The only way you could get truly anonymous coin would be to purchase it with cash. In this situation, it's not bitcoin keeping you anonymous, it's cash. Also each time you buy bitcoin, you would have to send it to a different address. This can allow you to remain anonymous to other civilians (as long as your computer is properly secured). Remaining anonymous from the government is a task which few people (if any) can achieve without dealing strictly in cash.
*: also the original point I made was that bitcoin doesn't make you anonymous, however it can be abused to somewhat achieve this purpose. Proxying bitcoins through accounts and using multiple accounts would certainly constitute abuse.
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:09:46
I don't see the point your making. You could easily store multiple addresses in a database for one user.

Price is completely irrelevant to bitcoin success, it doesn't matter at all what price it stabilises at, one important factor is that it will stabilise. And volatile markets stabilise with volume, volume that bitcoin is not at just yet (its only around 5 billion). Another important factor is reducing the technical entry requirement. It is simply too difficult for everyday citizens to utilize.
So for the time being, the best bitcoin can do is advance its infrastructure and political/corporate acceptance. All of which it is doing an exceptional job at.

Providing a service that credit cards and fiat money can't will get people using it. Especially for the over 6 billion people on this planet who are unbanked. For them they don't have the luxuries we take for granted everyday when it come to our finances, such as lines of credit and sending/receiving money across the world. Price is irrelevant when you start to consider the bigger picture.

It's being used as a ponzi scheme by idiots trying to get rich quick. Bitcoin itself has nothing in common with ponzi schemes. It's an attempt to decentralize currency, what relation does this share with selling shitty knifes on the ponzi triangle?
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:48:58
You're still missing the point. Bitcoin is in it's infancy, it needs to start somewhere. If you can think of a way to introduce and implement decentralized services, be my guest, however this is not developed as of yet. For the time being, this is the way bitcoin will grow, and that's completely reasonable.
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:09:58
There is certainly a need for easier online currency, cc is not the way to go (source, thousands of databases full of cc's constantly being breached). Bitcoin seems to fill this need, just needs a little more work to make it easier for btc-&gt;fiat and fiat-&gt;btc.
You treat the topic like a religion or a ponzi scheme leaving an ignorant taste in my mouth.
