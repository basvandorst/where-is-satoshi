Understand your point, it’s just not going to be well taken right now by people who are in the red thousands of dollars. Hopefully these folks will learn something about themselves from all this, and come out as stronger, better people, more focused on real happiness instead of chasing get rich quick schemes.

From coinbase:


We are prioritizing security and performance over new features
In terms of our engineering priorities, securely storing customer funds remains our top priority. Our next priority is to ensure that our platform remains performant during periods of peak volume. Following security and performance, we are focused on adding new features for our customers.
Many of our customers have been asking for SegWit, and we’re working out a way to implement this upgrade safely. We store billions of dollars worth of bitcoin on behalf of customers and any change to our infrastructure is done with significant planning and consideration for the security and stability of our platform.
Being larger actually makes it *more risky* and difficult for coinbase to implement new features over their network. This is true of any company- diseconomies of scale is a thing that megalithic entities have to deal with all the time.
Diversifying means not only diversifying across different crypto currencies but also diversifying across multiple exchanges to fully leverage both the stability of large players, and the flexibility of smaller entities. In the coming years, and transaction fee issues are ironed out, there will be more clear winners that emerge, and decreased cost in transferring various crypto currencies to your preferred exchange. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:19:17
That’s not a large wall.. like at all. Strong support begins at 10k, and really strong at 7-8K. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:15:35
To be fair. I think most people are in it for a combination of things. I bought in in 2014, so for me there’s really low risk, and I can afford to say ‘meh, price goes up, price goes down’ and enjoy the community. But I’m still also in this because I believe in long term gains behind this technology. It’s a bit silly to say it’s just one or the other
For people who got in at 17K and are losing their asses right now.. it’s prob not much fun
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:28:57
Yep. I’m like 75% BTC, 10% BCH, 10% ETH, 5% LTC. 
I’m a big believer in bitcoin, but I’m not some crazed zealot. Nobody should be
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:14:34
It’s dropped like 20% today so... this isn’t some shit to ignore. It could be a while before a real bounce back happens. Could also see a much deeper dip before that. 
Strap in buddy
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:15:23
This is almost certainly a high frequency algorithmic trading bot. It would be really hard to say the exact strategy of this ‘expert advisor’, only the programmer would really know the trading strategy.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:00:14
Been a little over a week but just wanted to check in. How’d that go?
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:32:39
Correct. Which has been happening for years, in what has actually been proportionally decreasing severity.
People are like “HOLY FUCK BALLS btc has dropped 50%”.
Do you remember crashes of 80-99%? Pepperidge farms remembers.
The last insanely major pullback was mt. Gox, and it lost like 80% in value. We will see what happens, but this is basically what anyone in crypto has signed up for. Hold on to your asses 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:28:31
Definitely. Don’t mean to say that like it’s sounds advice or a good way to go in general, but I’m absolutely not relying on this money for anything. If BTC was worth $1 when I woke up tomorrow I’d say “welp, that’s a shame” and nothing in my life would change. As it stands now, taking the money out wouldn’t change anything either- the fun I have participating and watching this go through the motions is worth more, kind of like Vegas.
If I had debt or kids or any real financial concern, I’d have dropped out long before even making the kind of returns I’ve seen. Happy to see where it goes, wherever that might be 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:40:19
Sure. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy the memes and positivity. But been here for years so I also know there needs to be some sense in this community as well. Not everyone bought BTC at $200... people have real shit to lose 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:14:27
Yeah maybe. I bought early 2014, have held most of everything. Took some profits just to secure a win out of all this. But a lot of people have other good jobs and income sources, and are letting ‘House money’ ride 
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:11:59
I can’t argue with most of what you’ve said here factually. But hey, they’re in this to maximize their profits, not provide charity to the network in the form of rushing out updates and features they’re not ready for for whatever reason and yes, part of that reason is self preservation- but that’s competition. all of what you’ve stated about Coinbase also represents opportunity for superior products to emerge and battle with Coinbase, new products that are implementing new features more quickly, and that is *exactly* what is occurring. It’s why you are on here saying “forget coinbase, these other dudes at providing a superior product”. I just don’t personally have a reason to move, knowing that Gdax is going to implement all the same upgrades eventually, and I can also just buy more crypto through other exchanges if I so choose. This isn’t mutually exclusive for me or most people.
Bottom line, coinbase became an industry leader largely for being quick to market with a secure, user friendly product, and now the rest of the industry is gonna have to deal with them swinging their big dick around a bit, but competition will help keep coinbase honest at the end of the day.. that day may just come a few months behind the cutting edge. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:45:43
For some this would now be 50-60% loss lol
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:17:59
Probably not incompetent. Probably ulterior motives- but are those motives not understandable from a business perspective? They are leveraging their size to slow progress to their benefit- that should leave a gap open for others to come in and say “our product is pushing out new features faster, use us instead!” And so the cycle of competition continues. A healthy market should be composed of some large, conservative players, and a bunch of new progressive ‘whippersnappers’ there to keep the big boys honest. I just don’t see any big fundamental issues here.  
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:09:42
It’s an exchange.. it makes more money from trade volume of any crypto currency. They don’t need to pick a winner, because they win no matter what is being bought/sold through their exchange.
Coinbases is not responsible for the brand of Bitcoin, and it’s not responsible for investors understanding what they are are voluntarily spending their own money on.
Basically 99.99% of people who’ve been with Gdax for 12+ months are totally happy with their experience. Coinbase/Gdax credited my account with bcash equal to my nominal bitcoin holdings prior to the fork, which I immediately converted into ETH through GDAX, and I have never had a single issue with them.
Such salty-ass people. Want to feel less salty? Maybe start by understanding wtf you’re investing in, and diversifying like any informed, responsible investor does. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:49:48
Yeah. I think we’re on the same page now, I’m seeing your point more, and agree that they deserve to be shamed, as it’s really the only tool for consumers in a totally unregulated market. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:59:40
Most even semi-long holders are up thousands of % and have already taken good profits. I think we’ll be ok. Plenty of us have the room for this type of positive thinking 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:13:03
Algorithmic trading program (expert adviser) doing its thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:48:56
Agreed, investigation ain’t happening. All in all.. not really feeling the hate train for coinbase either
made a shit load of money off bcash as did MANY other long term holders on Coinbase, and anyone who’s been using coinbase/GDAX as long as I have and has real money in this knows that every single one of these exchanges is vulnerable to manipulation and will have issues at some point. I’m gonna go ahead and not pay thousands of dollars in transactions fees to move off coinbase to a less robust environment, and I wouldn’t advise others to do so themselves- but that would be ignoring the fact that the vast majority of people kicking up dust have like $100-$500 in this on average. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:50:25
Little suggestion. If you haven’t already, take back most of your principal investment, that way you are just playing with profit (house money).

I mean hey. Up to you how you wanna view stuff. Gave the same presentation to my cousin over Skype, he ended up going in way deeper cuz he had more money to convert than me at the time. He’s profited almost 100K now.. to each their own. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:40:53
best way to do that is to go to the worst part your nearest city around 2AM. Bring $500 cash, and yell 'I HAVE CASH IN HAND. I WANT BITCOIN'
You should meet some friendly, 'totally not scammer' people like yourself

Because it’s entirely untrue lol

Ah gotcha, so not a long term holder. Anyway, enjoy man! Get your fam some nice Xmas gifts ;)
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:30:10
yes sorry, was up a bit late xD quite right.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:21:44
Funny thing is, that wouldn’t even be cashing out for them. That would just be taking like 10-15% out at this price haha
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:11:52
No clue. Judging by the order book, which is still open, people are interested in buying more at the frozen price than selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:53:37
Gotcha. That’s like butt end of high school/going off to college soon. I figured we were talking more the 14-17 range.
Still good to inform them of risks. Also a good idea to consider present value of the few hundred bucks they might throw at this. “Do I want $200 bucks to enjoy my young adult years more right now, or $500 bucks 3 years from now (possible not even) when my earning potential is way higher, making $500 relatively insignificant anyway”
Not saying tell them exactly what to do. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:08:47
Sure. But I think it’s more funny because of her crass response. She could have been like “thanks but it’s not for me” but instead she acted like she DID know the future. Which has turned out to be hilariously untrue 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:14:23
Refresh maybe? I see movement right now on gdax order book 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:26:59
Ah gotcha. So I'm guessing you're a bit on the younger side then? So we're probably not talking about life-changing amounts of money, and you're looking to get into investing?
Who knows, by next xmas you may have 3-4x what you put in today. As long as you are prepared to wait possibly a while before seeing returns, or potentially lose out, I say go for it.
In general, unless you are a pro with ample resources (solid algorithmic trading models, lots of capital) don't try to predict a market on the day-to-day. Invest in what you believe has good upside in the long run. And don't get greedy, cash out if you see a profit that means something to you
I am far from a pro, but have done pretty well for myself. Started off at a young age as well. Feel free to PM me if you ever need any advice, long or short term.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:28:59
Trying to predict this market is nigh impossible. Btc Futures trading is going to open up next week and there is a ton of speculation about how that will effect price, some positive some very negative.
I would be very careful making any large investment. Considering youre new to this, I advise at most to put ~3% of your total investment budget into it. I personally have it around 25% but that’s mostly due to long term gains that have caused BTC to become a large chunk of my portfolio- playing with profit is far less scary
I’ve been here for almost 4 years now and have seen stories of great fortune as well as very sad ones. Only you know your personal financial situation, and your appetite for risk.
That all being said, I believe in the technology, and still see a very high upside. But breaking it out specifically in the next 5 years:
10% chance BTC sees 3-20x more growth
80% chance we see price normalize, potentially under current value.
10% shit completely hits the fan and it tanks to like $500 per btc, never to come back again
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:56:41
Probably should have just taken your profits and let your initial investment ride. But hey, it wasn't a ton of cash, so not really a big deal either way. Even if bitcoin went up another 10x (which would be insane and probably not likely) that would just be like $4K. Not life changing money, so just enjoy and don't look back : )
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:09:45
Yes, history is frozen because of exactly what this post is saying. Keep your eye on the order book if you enjoy watching 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:46:25
I’m sorry but this is basically r/ThatHappened material.
I’m not saying it’s impossible. But someone who knew enough about bitcoin in the past to have 25 BTC would not *just* be remembering now, at ~$17K a coin like “dude omg bitcoin is a thing and I just happen to have 500 grand worth of it”. Nah, anyone who has been involved with bitcoin to that extent has already ripped through every PC and hard drive that could have ever possibly had a fraction of BTC on it, let alone 25
Also, the last fucking thing on a persons mind who just found 500K would be coming into this subreddit and chatting with randos lol.
On the off chance you really did find that stash, this post is super ill advised. you should delete it and any mention of it anywhere on the internet. 
Good story for feels though. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:11:59
Discourage them from doing so please. Kids don't need to be sinking their xmas money into bitcoin because they heard about it on facebook news.

@_date: 2017-12-15 18:36:51
Well, I wouldn’t necessarily pay off your debt. It really depends on your interest rate on that debt
If you can sell the bitcoin, and put that money into bonds that have a ROI than the interest you are currently paying on loans, then just put the bitcoin profits into bonds, and continue making your loan payments. At the end of the day you’ll have more $
But obviously if you loans cost you more than you can profit from holding your money, pay off your loans 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:04:56
We'll see. I am holding, but that's been the case for me for 3 years now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:43:00
It might not be answer you’re looking for, but if this kind of thing makes you nervous, sell now, walk away with some profit, and never look back. Otherwise, sit back and watch the show if you believe there is an upside to your investment.  Do not listen to hodl memes, do what is best for you. 
Do not day trade unless you are a professional and have access to sufficient resources (ie lots of holdings of bitcoin, and lots of cash, and a steady hand)
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:23:51
Congrats my dude. You leave any on the table or fully pull out?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:39:12
I’ve had the exact opposite happen, and sold at slightly higher than list. 
Coinbase (if you are brokering through them) takes ~1.5% on any buy/sell order.
They are making tons of money completely legitimately they have no reason to do fraudulent stuff
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:45:53
I agree with this. As an early adopter I’ve taken a few grand of profits just to be able to say “I got something”. Other than that, I’ll ride this ship into the fucking ground before I take anything less than $50K/coin. That’s the point I get out, and after years of this I’m a very patient man. I just hope there are lots like me
If I lose, I lose

@_date: 2017-12-01 23:37:04
Ehh. I think most people will convert back when they see enough profit that it makes a real difference in their life. For some, that was when they made a few grand and could finally get their car fixed or w/e, for me and others it can be a longer term investment/gamble depending on how you look at it. 
I absolutely am passionate about this stuff, but  if I ever  see enough money to put a down payment on my first house in the Bay Area (which to my great excitement is becoming close to reality), bye bye bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:02:01
This is a somewhat complicated question. But the short answer is yes.
If a person decides to sell like ~80 BTC at once, then in theory, if the next 100K orders on the book are completed by that sale, each for $100 to unique individuals, then what you’ve described is exactly what will occur 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:32:45
Well.. it is an excuse. You can decide for yourself if it’s acceptable, but the incentives are in the right place for Coinbase cause they only make money when the money is moving regardless whether it’s going up or down

Agreed. This rally has been crazy. Frankly I was happy to see 9-10k by the end of this year.. won’t be too shocked if we see some major pullback. Then again I’m not really shocked by anything anymore having been here for like 4 years now haha
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:09:09
You talking about mining BTC? Not sure what kind of hardware you've got, that you can even mine BTC at this point. Most consumer hardware is barely close to capable of solving even tiny fractions of blocks.

@_date: 2017-12-08 16:55:49
Interesting. But it sounds about right to be honest. It is supposed to become extremely expensive/difficult to mine as each additional block is solved. In the next few years we're going to be getting past the big mining phase, and moving more towards supply normalization, and price normalization should come with that when demand levels off.  Big advancements in computer power should allow for slight bumps in supply as time goes on.
It's similar to gold, in that finding additional gold is *extremely* costly and will only continue to be more difficult as more is literally mined from the earth. But advances in actual mining technology occasionally allow for an increase in supply

Fear/risk basically. People see it hit 20k after buying 20 coins at 16K. They are taking their profit. These are day traders/institutions not interesting in anything but profit which makes sense. 
200k today is worth more than “the moon” to them
People on this sub who’ve bought at 200 bucks a coin couldn’t give half a flying fuck. That’s why I say hold the line hah
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:31:03
If you sell now, you need to be satisfied with what you’ve made because you may never get back in at the same price. 
However, all signs point to this last week being way outside fundamental growth. So could be a good time to sell high 
The truth: who the fuck knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:27:57
yep. They are doing very well, but it's also a very stressful time for them I'm sure. One major flaw or blow-up and literally everything goes down the drain. Lawsuits, etc

@_date: 2017-12-08 16:39:54
my advice obviously comes with the disclaimer that I could be completely wrong- and that goes for everyone, including hedge fund billionaires, wall street analysts, etc
That said, I like Ethereum. It has some issues, and will see a lot of growing pains, but the technology behind it is promising. It is more capable than BTC as a means of transaction, especially in terms of 'smart contracts'. If you are interested in altcoins, I would start your research there. I have about 10% of my overall holdings in alts, mostly in ETH
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:13:49
I wish I could give you a really badass story hah. but my family are good people so I made a bit of fun, and they were just like “yeah yeahh kid, we’re happy for you”.

Yeah, of course I would love that. But we’re all happy and healthy so.. all good hah. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:31:04
That would give bitcoin a market cap higher than US gdp haha. So I imagine we’re gonna be hitting some barriers before that 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:16:35
ahhh. Ok that makes sense.
If you want to look at it that way, then we're talking about ~$2K a year being generated from mining. Since you aren't paying the power bill at your house, you get to keep that as profit, so not too shabby!
Put in what you're comfortable with, but just accept that it might be dust in the wind when you wake up one morning to find BTC at like $3K hah
For someone like you, who doesn't have a ton to play with, it may be better to bet on it crashing, and put your $ in when it does. But  I mean.. people have been saying that all year long and look where it got them.
I think you know what you're in for my dude
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:32:38
The “issue” for me is that I’ve blown past my Coinbase weekly buying limit in terms of total holdings, so I can’t even sell with intent to buy back in for same nominal value. This is causing me to hold when I’d normally want to short right now... which is not a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:00:39
I wish I could say I bought a ton, but the truth is I only bought a couple back then out of curiosity and general interest in blockchain. It wasn’t until this year at around 3-4k that I bought a few more more.
Still no complaints of course but def not retiring any time soon haha.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:50:21
ok fuck off lol.

@_date: 2017-12-11 03:07:21
if you sold then the $ was probably something that really mattered to you. Enjoy your gains, and don't think about it too much.
Stress takes a toll.  If that 3-4K dip was enough to even make you break a slight sweat, better off not getting back in.
If you do get back in, take on a 'down with the ship' mentality and don't look back until you reach your exit point, which you should know before you even buy back in. You can't predict this shit
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:02:10
Small bit of advice- obviously invest only what you can lose, and whatever that amount is, I would put ~90% in BTC, and take ~10% and diversify in promising altcoins (particularly Ethereum).
gl and welcome
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:57:15
I feel you dude. I’ve been glued to this for a week now and def getting less sleep myself at this point. Thinking of getting out but.. the $ isn’t quite enough to make a big dent yet.
You had balls sticking it out with that kind of cash on the table. I’d have quit around ~100-200k. But I’m 24 still looking to get my first house 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:26:46
So you think popping off about it verbally (what most people do) is more convincing than a real attempt to educate someone with a universally accepted tool and format that contained legitimately  sourced material, and embedded video?
At the time, I had almost no money to convert (was 19) and put about 25% of my savings in. Had they put even a trivial fraction of their money in, they’d have made hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit now, which was precisely what I illustrated with my PowerPoint as being a low possibility, but high enough to take a small risk for.

It really can’t be said enough.. if you think converting to bitcoin has high upside, then convert *what you can afford to lose* and enjoy!
If you see some real gains like 2x your principal, then it might be a good idea to convert back what you initially put in. From that point forward you’re playing with profit. 
If you lose it all, it’s ok because that should be affordable to you. 
With that said, stop waiting, get a modest amount (maybe it’s $100 bucks worth, maybe you can afford to lose $1000. Only you know that). 
Good luck man

Bitcoin is going to go through distinct stages (this is not my opinion, this is how andreas antonopoulos and others have described the technology for a long time).
First BTC has acted as a type of 'messaging system' where people are basically expressing value to each other. We're passed that stage and onto 'store of wealth' stage, which could last for possibly several more years, with great fluctuations. Finally, if all goes well, Bitcoin price should normalize at *some* level, and move into a means of transaction.

not sure where youre getting this from? any link?

No joke, I made a PowerPoint presentation to my whole family in mid 2014 about why everyone should buy at least a couple bitcoins because it would be a ‘very modest diversification of their portfolios’ and was literally laughed at like “silly kid, go on an play your crazy coin games’
Embrace the urge my friend. We may never see another win like this in our lives

I get some unique satisfaction in this regard. I made a PowerPoint presentation about crypto currency back in 2014, and presented the entire case for it seriously and rationally to my parents and older sister. Was basically told “that’s nice, go have your internet funsies”
Pulled that presentation back up ‘for funsies’ during thanksgiving day when everyone was back this year. “guys look how SILLY I was back then. HAHAHAHAHA”

It makes you post a link.. no text post option, just link and image. At least on mobile
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:52:35
Eh. We don't need this kind of article here haha. We all know. This is for the birds
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:44:02
Congrats man. You know what's best for you, but consider selling the principal investment you made, that way whatever btc you let ride is just your profit. It makes it pretty much stress-free
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:27:57
It’s probably gonna tank. This shit ain’t normal even for bitcoin. 
I say that as someone who still sees higher upside than this, but not like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:32:55
Sometimes just putting it totally out of mind is worth it. But yeah.. even keeping like 5% would be a good call 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:52:45
Very true. It’s just her level of certainty that has earned her this meme of a video.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:48:29
Hah yeah, good catch
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:21
Take back what you initially invested, and just leave your profits on the table. That way you’ve got nothing to lose

Do we know the current short interest in bitcoin? Any reliable place where we can see how many outstanding short positions are being held?
It seems like the guy in the vid is implying it would be a good time for a short squeeze, but really interested to know how he’s backing it all up 
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:14:06
If Warren had converted 1 of his Berkshire A share into bitcoin in early 2015, that would be worth $6MM today instead of $300K. 
Dude can go fuck himself
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:12:22


I was 19 at the time, had ~$1100 in savings, and put $600 down on bitcoin.
Aside from eating food that month and buying a few beers, I did make that bet. Have bought more since. 
Obviously the dude is rich beyond imagination, but if he wants to call bitcoin “rat poison” then I’ll go ahead and say he can fuck right off. Doesn’t mean I don’t respect what he’s made of himself, but his words threaten my positions because his word is taken seriously, and I believe he is incorrect. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 19:51:44
Correct. My parents were both federal agents for 25 years, firearms instructors at times, and chose to carry glock 9mms for the course of their careers

Got it. well, you know where you priorities are at, but being so young, make sure you have enough $ to have fun with your friends and stuff. Thats whats really important at your age.. just living and enjoying life.
The days of BTC being some sort of get rich quick scheme are definitely over. Probably the best case scenario you'd be able to turn that $1K into $3-4K a year from now.
Worst case scenario, that $1k could turn into $2-300 a year from now.
what is certain is that there is going to be *a lot* of volatility up to that point.
My final call for you would be to drop in ~$150 bucks and call it a day. That sounds like an amount of money that probably wouldn't kill you to lose, but if it turns into $1K that would be damn nice.
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:38:50
Historically, in crashes and major recessions, money gets divested quickly from volatile securities/assets. Bitcoin is a very volatile, speculative investment, so I don’t think a real crash would be good for bitcoin price short to medium term (5-10 years). But long term? Possibly, who knows. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 01:09:43
In the long run, definitely a possibility worth considering. Short/medium, big money in bitcoin will likely run back to its solid game plan, and chill for a while to limit risk.
But I’m with you on the idea that any crash at this point will benefit cryptos image long term, and further strengthen the desire for a global, transparent, and scalable means of transacting. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:11:14
Lol I mean.. it’s rebounded for like 5 minutes to.. 6.8k. A rebound would be going back to 8-9K today.

There are plenty of people who did exactly that.. you just don’t see them spamming hodl on Reddit.

You are delusion if you think you have any better idea than anyone else.
The only key to this and any other financial venture was making a sound investment strategy from the beginning, and sticking to it. If you win, you win, if not, try again some other time with a better strat. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:51:07
Not at all. It’s been bullish, just not in the direction people holding want. A bear market represents relatively low volume, low price movement for extended periods.

No, literally conceded: "I want to be clear that I don't disagree with any of their releases as I believe fully in transparency"
You're purposely avoiding his main point: "...wikileaks worked with the russian government to selectively release materials in order to aid the trump campaign"
To your point:


Do you think that Trump's decision to run when he did was made like the day before he announced it publicly? Because that's what you're implying here, which is ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:11:50
Ahh yes, this coming from Wikileaks, truly known for its reliability and ethical standards /s
