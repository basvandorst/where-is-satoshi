Unless Im misinterpreting your tone, I just want to say That scrypt is a good thing, gpus are far more distributed and decentralized than asics 
Well, in theory at least since asics exist now for scrypt  (?)

Its kinda not if the limiting factor is the servers keeping the trading data in sync amongst each other
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:42:26
That took git 10 days to publish.

Its very cheap for them. They just confirm their own spam and take their fees back + the block reward 
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:55:40
I want to see the same thing, I love reading reports like that. If they dont, its probably something really embarrassing lol 
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:07:40
I think its very obvious its susceptible to attack

Technically correct (given that you can call a GPU an asic for graphics), 


I agree there should not be any security by obfuscation, but that is not the problem stopping other manufacturers from entering the market; its the incredible tape-out costs of building ASICs. Its nearly economically impossible for small mfgs: see Sia. So GPU’s win there for me. Every consumer has a GPU (your cell phone has one, even if its integrated and ass for mining)
GPU mining does produce heat and waste! This is how the network is secured. People spend money on the heat to produce hashpower, at least GPU hardware can be repurposed in the future for a mining algo that uses SETI Most All asics are literal trash once the algo is changed, so GPU’s get a +100 points for reuse. Wasting heat is the point, but GPU’s could someday do something useful; asics never will unless extreme heat harnessing measures are taken (Like a asic powered water heater)  
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:21:10
But you’ll buy a asic that only produces heat? At least GPU’s can do something else. 
(Ignoring how dumb the last comment you replied to was)

And where is the money to go? People put money into tether because they thought it was safe, if its not people will move to the next safest option.... which I believe would be bitcoin, as people will also be skeptical of the other stable coins. People can sell for actual USD on some exchanges, but that’ll just push tether further down. 
Its just a theory, and a slippery slope one
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:00:20
You said literally nothing that proves me wrong?
On an exchange you can sell anything, you might be getting 1/sat for it but some bot that someone hasn’t updated will buy it down to worthlessness, and during the trip down people will move what money they have left elsewhere. 
Its not like there is a switch that says “tether value = 0” lol
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:39:08
Thats my logic
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:14:19
Honestly Id just be happy at this point with something from non-lunatic sounding urls 
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:31:50
That makes sense. I was a little confused on how you thought buying tether would somehow give you different returns from the cash part lol
@_date: 2018-06-01 05:08:59
Man, do I love WhalePanda
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:47:07
“You dont really know that do you”
How insightful and constructive. I had no idea this guy couldn’t actually predict the future. TIL
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:48:43




Yeah, its a no for me Mr. narrative. Nice try come again 
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:04:30
I mean..... its impossible to do it any other way. Are they supposed to send you $2 in bitcoin 10x a day? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:08:14
I dont particularly understand the relevance that to robinhood...
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:54:02
What do you mean? If you just refuse to give up the password and refuse to explain what you used to encode it there is not other master key. Right? 
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:32:32
Congrats? Do that then. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:55:56
So I only have to HODL for 300 more years? No problem
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:01:41
Private use. I dont really think mass decentralization is their goal. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:22:37
\&gt;0 = *technically possible*
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:09:37
For institutions of that size I cant imagine they wont want something they fully control. I don't think the banking industry will have many problems with funding. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:21:29
Theyd just use (and have been discussing) private corporate chains. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:28:59
I mean, *there technically is*
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:52:31
Also correct
@_date: 2018-07-23 12:17:31
Oh shut the fuck up 
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:37:44
Electricity is also cheap af 
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:13:28
Shhhhhhhhhh lol at least I tried to read the article
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:59:41
Unfortunatly the website is unreadable on mobile, half the text is just clipped off my screen and I cant scroll over. Iphone 8, on safari if this happens to be your site OP 
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:20:46
Gold has the same intrinsic value as bitcoin does. It is valuable because there is little of it, same with bitcoin (and people want it). You couldn't of picked a worse analogy 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:58:50
Go google "define intrinsic" and you'll quickly discover you are wrong. It means naturally occurring. It is a natural phenomena that its rare, and its because of that we give it value. Its simple 
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:00:02


Im gonna guess no
