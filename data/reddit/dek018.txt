Do you think Bitcoin may reach $20,000 USD this year...?

BCH is a huge mess, almost 20% down, think it's lower than before pumping; does this general crash have to do anything with the BTC fork...? I've noticed this last week everything has been about it...

What on earth is this, could someone explain me...? This is what they meant when they said BTC could reach near zero? D:

Worst. Market. Ever. You must have steel guts to bear this kind of things, I don't want everything to moon or to reach new heights, I would only like the market to go 2x to recover my money, cash out and forget all of this ever happened.

Yeah, those people that are actually happy when the prices plummet must have unlimited money and can invest every single time there is a dip, they probably also have a magic crystal ball where they can see the market behaviour, so, they know exactly when there will be a rise and a fall (he didn't have any money invested right now, he must have cashed out in september, when it was the last time bitcoin rose, close 9k as I recall, or probably since April when it almost reached 10k), he's happy he will invest with the low prices now because he's 100% certain the market won't dip further, and if it does, who cares? He still has unlimited money... ��

Any chance of seeing a 5000 bitcoin again anytime soon...? ��
