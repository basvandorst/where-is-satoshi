How about Ripple instead?

So it is too hard. Please don't invest, you will probably sell low and buy high.

So it is hard for you to understand that America + Europe + Russia + China = ezpz?

Kiss my Ripple

You brought up bankruptcy first. You just want to argue. You demean people by calling them simpletons and in the same post write cleaver and dept. @_date: 2019-04-25 21:40:31
I don't own bcash or use the btc subreddit. See, bcash bcash bcash. I can think lightning isn't in a great place and not be a fudder.

Will it be ready in 18 months?

Lightning isn't ready and behind schedule, yet you want to try to integrate it with a browser? Good luck with that.

This is real life, not a fantasy.

Looks like you are the one who is stupid and can't read.
@_date: 2018-11-01 21:37:52
You can but its not relevant in this situation.

You are calculating a minimum not a maximum. If   someone in a high electricity cost country wants to buy instead of mine then they are adding demand that isn't included in your equation. What if they want 5,000 bitcoin today? 10,000?

Perhaps we never reached consolidation.
@_date: 2018-07-24 23:10:28
Check the volume. If something goes up and has little volume then its a pump and dump.
@_date: 2018-12-22 21:10:38
Lol they still aren't affordable too!
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:32:19
Omg buy buy!!
