Futures seems to make price a little more 'hold your horses'.. I wonder what lessons the experienced future-traders have learned about btc these first few days. What does btc's response to the CME opening mean?

The only thing people need to be afraid of is not owning crypto. If you own, no worries. The financial crisis will see BTC soar as people are panic buying.

NSA white paper on crypto 31 october 1996:  [   
Bitcoin white paper realeased 31 oct 2008.  
Bitcoin is SHA-256 algo-based. Its an NSA algo.  Along with the fact that the elusive Satoshi has 1 million BTC it makes me think the US gov is behind it, or the forces that control the US gov. If a nation controlled those keys it would be the richest in the world if BTC goes to the level alot of people believe it will go to. How convenient. This was the sole reason i bought BTC.

Ive also wondered about cicada. What project do the winners get to work on? Maybe they are behind some of the crypto. I feel they work with some AI in relation to crypto, but thats just a gut feeling. 
Do you have any articles or more info/speculation? Will read!

Bitcoin is not the opposite. Bitcoin is exactly as described in the NSA paper. Every btc, where it has been, where it came from, can be  tracked through the blockchain. They can literally track every single "cent". With all the metadata they have access to it wouldnt be to hard to find out who is sending money to who in the long run. Alot of people believe btc is anonymous, but it is far from it. Just because you dont register your name, does not mean they cant find out who you are.
