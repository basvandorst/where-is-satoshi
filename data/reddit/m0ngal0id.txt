nice explanation. never thought about it that way.

yes hodl while the pumpers and dumpers make double triple or more returns than you make by hodling. 
yes they make you feel good by stroking your ego or giving you an attaboy for hodling but the main thing is if there are enough baghodlers the scheme can keep working. no hodlers means no fiat in the system to prop up this ponziesque game. sell when there is a pump and just keep buying back after the dump. works like clockwork.

agree 100%. the run bitcoin has had to $800 has been nice but I could have made way more money in this stock market bull run. plenty of blue chip stocks that have gone up 5-6x. nvidia comes to mind seeing. was $15 a few years ago now over $100. so many more.  smh
@_date: 2017-01-07 12:43:22
what possible reason would send the price to $300? miners would be shutting down their machines at $600.
@_date: 2017-01-13 12:45:56
i doubt that. i think people are just pissed with the dump and are venting imo.

the potential for that kind of volatility without any real reason other than unfounded rumors doesnt help. why does a hack at an exchange drive the price down $300? has nothing to do with anything other than coins moving from one wallet to another zero sum. I have never understood this. I can understand if there is a problem looming in the protocol but, stolen bitcoins, or china rumors or any other bs just cant affect the price like it does.

good time to buy for the long term is right now. china helping to curb volitility atm will help build a foundation in the high $700 low $800s for the next move up. higher lows is the name of the game

i have bought and sold bitcoin since $13. I have seen alot since 2012. the only way this thing works is to have market makers buying the coins from the sellers and not giving the churners a chance to keep buying back lower. once the potential to always buy back is gone I think it has a chance

call them credits like in the movie total recall. need to break down the psychological price barrier to people that feel they missed the boat.

its not normal for a commodity asset to lose 30% overnight on a rumor. if there is this type of potential going forward bitcoin is way way to immature to hit mainstream etf status. 
as far as your analysis. can we agree that the dump was due to china rumors? at least that is what they are saying on social media and the heavy hitters in bitcoin are agreeing. 
there should have been some elasticity  with the price. but if you notice every dump in the past on an unfounded rumor, the price never goes immediately back to where it was. which tells me that it was artificially inflated to dump and the sellers regardless have no desire to buy back. If a stock or some other asset drops due to a fake or inaccurate report. It will usually rebound right back to where it was. in essence nothing has changed. bitcoin does but over a long period.
bottom line there are not enough buyers. there are way too many sellers waiting to dump their coins on a pump.

i agree. it is a scam but you can still make money. there are groups of whales who have ridiculous amounts of coins that no mining conglomerate will ever catch up with. maybe a multi billionaire could buy 100's of thousands but that would only be for braggin rights.  this is why wall street isnt getting in they know that the playing field will never ever be level let alone skewed to their favor from which they are used to.

the bitcoin community as a whole are a bunch of dicks. everyone thinks they know it all. and most of the time they are all wrong. bunch of basement dwelling narcissistic troglodytes that are miserable that they have not made any significant money over the last 4 years. while everyone else around them has(traders of the pumps and dumps, Venture capital recipients etc)
face it people bitcoin isnt going anywhere fast soon. something supposedly touted as the next best thing since sliced bread should have been mainstream adopted whatever you want to call it, by now. Please dont give me reasons in the past and how long this and that took to become adopted or mainstream. information has never been more fully disemminated throughout the world as it is RIGHT NOW. 20 yrs ago yes things took longer to adopt because look how long it took to communicate or get information from one side of the planet to the other. right now it is instantaneous. so what is the hold up if bitcoin is so great? Its not.

i remember that night well. he was posting limit sells at different prices before he finally settled on $300. and stuck his limit sell there. Personally I think some major major players stepped in and bought him out. because the markets were so thin on the bid side at that time that if he put in a market sell it would have driven the price down into the $100's. plus everyone was cost averaging all the way down from the Ath. Bottom line everyone was broke.
@_date: 2017-01-03 13:56:17
3 left in the world. and seeing he doesnt want to show the key its probably been spent already. nice though

its only the beginning...just wait til the demand &gt; supply
@_date: 2017-01-07 12:26:38
if there are weak hands still selling then there is no new money coming in either
@_date: 2017-01-07 12:41:11
you could have sold at $1100 and bought back in, in the $800s
thats how everyone does it. dont hodl. bitcoin pumps every single time like clockwork ultimately end in a dump and you can always buy back cheaper always.

etf is dead. could have been possible but a 30% haircut overnight I think was a dagger. a true bitcoin etf would have to be available 24/7 to buy and sell imo so I cant see it being listed on nasdaq. thoughts?

as long as I have income I will continue to add to my position. scarcity will take us to the moon. its not a question of if but when there will be a shortage of coins.
@_date: 2017-01-08 14:52:25
the thing is when gold or oil sell off there are market makers that actually will be buyers and sellers of last resort to keep the market somewhat orderly. almost like limit down circuit breakers with the stock market. bitcoin has nothing in place. so in essence say roger ver decided to dump 50000 coins in one shot. seeing the only buyers are bots or limit buys orders. bitcoin could go down to $200 in one trading day. yes the stock markets and commodity markets can be volitile but there still is a sense of order is what I can see them debating.
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:40:08
you cant lose if you are selling a pump. example if I sold at say $1050. I could have bought back in at $800. as long as you sell the pump how can u lose money? you are locking in your profits. if it keeps going up you stick to your guns and wait for it to come back down. that has been my problem. I keep thinking that it will keep rising and stay high, but alas it ALWAYS ALWAYS goes lower.
