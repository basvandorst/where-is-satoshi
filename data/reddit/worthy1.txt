It eventually was solved in another thread/post.  The stalled transaction would not drop from the network, so someone found a way to get it to complete by using a service that "asks" miners to prioritize the transaction.    
Still a difficult technology to deal with when something out of the ordinary happens.

Is there a better location to ask these questions?

UPDATE: brought down bitcore, deleted mempool.dat and restarted.  My balance is now correct minus the .5 send... but the .5 send is not pending in the destination wallet and I cant find it on block explorer.  So did I nuke my own resend somehow?    Is there a resync or resend I should be doing?

Didnt work as expected, but maybe as designed.  Electron cash shared my wallet from Electrum, but when I sent a BTC to another address, the BCC decremented also.  I thought i was a split?  Is it supposed to work this way?

Now I have to know how to run a full node?!

Yeah, that worked!  +1

Everytime I follow those instructions and try to sweep the key into the electron cash, I get an error message saying the key doesnt exist.

How do I import a wallet into Electron Cash.  There doesnt seem to be an import option in that app?  (Sorry, trying to get out of n00b status asap.)
Edit: Using BitcoinCore

Wait, so its like my Bitcoin split 2 for 1 and I have equal numbers in both chains?  If I was a BTC wallet holder, where would I access my cloned/split Bcash?

I sent .3 BTC to an electrum wallet as a test, and they forked into electron cash also.  But sending additional coins did not fork, so I am lost.

Well I installed Electron Cash, and it used the wallet from Electrum and both show m300 in either BTC or BCC.  So now I have both?

Where are my keys in BitcoinCore?  I have a wallet, which I assume has the keys, and I can save that anywhere, but there is no import wallet function in Electrum, is there?

oh, I get it.  I am in effect, splitting my old Bitcoin private keys from my wallet into both new chains.  So I need to use my old private keys to create a new wallet on each service and then send my old key to BOTH new keys, right?  I could though, create the new BTC key on any wallet (like Jaxx or electrum), but I have to create the new Bcash wallet on something like Electron Cash. 
I presume for safety sake, move the BTC first and wait for confirmation?

Start with "does it matter?" and then proceed to talk about decentralized currency and things are worth what people believe they are worth.  Cant' lose.
