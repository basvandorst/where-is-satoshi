In that case, go check out IOTA. Who needs blockchains when you have a DAG with zero fee transactions? No, but really Bitcoin is still king, and will likely keep going up for the years to come. 10k will be sooner then people think.

If historically, Bitcoin goes down as the coin that pulled Japan's economy up and pulled them of debt, well, no other coin would have shit on that.

IOTA can due to not using a blockchain at all. It uses a directed acyclic graph that could support up to 1000tps. With zero transaction fees.

Servers can be just turned on! That's why they consider cloud environments elastic! They shouldn't even need to setup the environments, things like custom AWS AMIs exist... Scaling can be automated if enough time is put into it. 
I know guys, I know. I've worked on projects like this with AWS. Which is why I said.


Obviously, Coinbase hasn't put enough time into it. So we're back at the original argument of Coinbase dropping the ball.

Seems like their taking the advice from the email. If you've been out of the loop here's the last update. "Hi Bitfloor users,I have had my attention elsewhere for the past couple of months, but since I continue to receive email from many users still trying to obtain refunds, I wanted to post another update to answer the most common questions.Based on all the email I've seen, it appears that many (most? all?) of the following types of users have still not received their refunds:* Users outside the US* Users owed BTC balancesIf you are in one of these two groups but you actually DID receive your refund, please email me to let me know when that happened, and if you're comfortable sharing it, approximately how much you received. That would be helpful to other users who are still waiting.Based on the lack of updates from Bitfloor since August, my recommendation at this point would be for each group — the group of users outside the US awaiting refunds, and the group of users owed BTC balances — to organize in a similar way that I organized this email list to recover USD balances. It might make sense to have two organizers, since each group will have separate logistical issues. The non-US users with cash balances need Bitfloor to find some method for processing international wires or SWIFT transfers. The BTC users need Bitfloor to correct whatever issues exist on its web platform that are preventing users from withdrawing BTC.I won't have time to continue pursuing Bitfloor for the next several months, but if you're in one of the affected groups and would like to become an organizer to keep pursuing the issues, email me and I'd be happy to share information with you about what I've learned.Best,AudenX"

Read my post. I'm not on the Pi anymore. This is also happening on an Intel I7. I know Pis are slow...

I agree, even a normal commercial would be huge. Especially on a few news channels.

They mean immediately before 'halving'.

Is there any place I can get it with BTC directly?

This is some good info. I was wondering where I could get my own data. Thanks!

I wouldn't judge too much, it's a pretty good idea. Ever heard of the Thomas Theorem? ["If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences."](

This was one of the best broadcasted explanations I've seen so far about bitcoin and it's legitimacy. I might have to pick up your book soon too!

If someone starts it I'll donate .5 BTC.
