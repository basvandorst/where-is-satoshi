Or just use a linux on usb stick for all your banking to stay safe, and read your clickbait on another device.

Can you give any reasons why this should be the case?

Pretty funny to say that in the context of this comment chain.

I wonder how much of your money you would be able to recover if your bank is hacked because of an attack on SHAx. Probably everything because the state or insurance will bail them out and you kept a separate record at home. Massive bail-outs happened before for other reasons, for example after the last financial crisis. Im not debating the legitimation of such bailouts here, just saying they could happen as a reaction to hacking, too.

If you are claiming that the banking system has never changed since it's beginning, and that records are still kept on paper, you are clearly wrong, that's laughable.

Bitcoin is practically irrelevant to the average reddit user, thats why we observe that serious posts don't get anywhere as many upvotes as jokes with a wider appeal.

You know what's even more energy efficient? A currency that is not based on proof of work.

The fine print reminds me of a cigarette box.

Adoption is not only dependent on the technology itself.
Rogers
diffusion of innovations (DOI) theory breaks the adoption 
process down into five stages. In the awareness stage, the 
individual is exposed to the innovation, but lacks complete 
information about it. In the interest or information stage the 
individual becomes interested in the new idea and seeks 
additional information about it. The next stage is evaluation,
where the individual mentally applies the innovation to his 
present and anticipated future situation, and then decides 
whether or not to try it. In the trial stage the individual 
employs the innovation. Finally, in the adoption stage the 
individual decides to continue the full use of the innovation. 
Rogers also presents five characteristics of an innovation. 
The relative advantage is the degree to which the new 
technology is better than a preceding one. Compatibility is the 
consistency with existing values, past experiences and needs. 
Complexity is the difficulty of understanding and use. A new 
technology is more likely to be adopted if it is compatible with 
existing practices of adopters, and is relatively easy to 
understand and use. Trialability is the degree to which it can 
be experimented with on a limited basis. Finally, observability
is the visibility of its results.

Naive. People who make 1.50$ per month don't have access to digital devices, or the knowledge how to use them.
