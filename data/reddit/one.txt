yeah, they clearly didn't rob enough others, who had more.

Sorry about your loss, but why did you keep so much btc in your account? I only send btc from my wallet to my exchange account when I'm about to trade, and only just enough. This way I keep my exchange-related risks to a minimum and never have to worry about losing it all due to exchange being hacked/going down/disappearing. Seems almost reckless to keep that much funds in a place that doesn't exactly have a perfect track record.

Many aspects of the tulip mania [have been debunked](
Mackay got most of his data from anti-speculation pamphlets


moralistic attack against speculation by the authorities,
as were all of the numerous pamphlets that appeared
immediately after the end of the episode.


single Semper Augustus bulb was sold at the height of
the speculation for 5500 guilders, a weight of gold equal
to $33,000 evaluated at $300/oz. Mackay provided
neither the sources of these bulb prices nor the dates on
which they were observed, however.

"Tulip mania" took place during 1634-1637 and many aspects of the "mania" part have been debunked.

didn't see Payeer mentioned

Payeer supports BTC and ETH. Also BCash for withdrawals. Site loads fine for me, but under card limits they state 


The account personalization does not provide the possibility to order Payeer MasterCard for residents of the countries outside the European economic area (EEA).****
so access could be geo restricted.

Last time I bought an Amazon gift card for bitcoins, I received it within seconds. I've also paid for plane tickets with bitcoins and the order confirmed instantly (almost). I once tried to buy something from Newegg with my Visa and received a reply only after 24 hours telling me that they only accept domestic Visa cards and that my order is cancelled.

By that logic, bitcoin is also instant. Transaction shows up in mempool within seconds and actual settlement (inclusion in a block) happens later.

Banks are not to blame here. Hyperinflation takes place when people's confidence in the government collapses, usually due to war or political turmoil. When the power of the government vanishes, the currency issued by that governement quickly becomes worthless. Zimbabwe eventually had to legalize the use of 
foreign currencies, because they couldn't restore people's confidence in their own government. They now function using the currency issued by other (trusted) governments.
