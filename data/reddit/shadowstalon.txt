Can do. I'll just make a whole range of them for everyone to use. Unfortunately the source I used for this was sped up, so I was limited.

I wasn't fucking kidding!

Thanks man! I got in late after being a longtime lurker. Not super late, but just enough that I'm just enjoying the ride and making memes for the greater good :)

I'll find a way

Oh, I definitely tried, but it never gained traction, so I just made a comment and here we are.

Yeah, a couple of states, Coinbase is the only one you are permitted to use due to some states crazy regulations already.

I also accept bitcoin. See what I did there?

Yep, I used After Effects entirely for this and as soon as I have some more spare time, I'd love to make the meme even more high quality, so definitely PM me.

I'm going to make a slew of them today for a ton of different marks. Where would be the best place to put them for easy meming?
