It’s a good and simple wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:07:56
I think it's not about which wallet it is. If you use an app like, let's say Coinomi, Trust or whatever it's really just a UI to access the address in the blockchain. HoneyBadger just notices that the supplied address is an exchange address. Which doesn't work with them.

@_date: 2018-03-06 21:22:45
Kraken‘s been good to me. Don’t panic too much.

Cracking up right now.

This is from HoneyBadger's FAQ:
"You may also create a paper wallet on the spot by choosing the "Create Wallet" option in the "Buy Coins" section. Please make sure to keep the paper wallet safe: losing the paper wallet will result in the loss of your money."
Just to be sure: you don't happen to have a cold wallet already? I wouldn't recommend to store crypto in exchange wallets unless you're trading with it.

I don't know if I am understanding what you are trying to explain. You say you are trying to *sell* BTC but in the same sentence you are saying that you want to *send* BTC? Those are two different processes for me.

Tier 3 verification on kraken.com was 20 hours for me last week.

Why do you need to take a LOAN in order to buy more crypto when you’re living on it for 3 years now?

Do you REALLY think this is worth anything? I could as well draw some lines on a piece of paper. A chart is a chart is a chart.

It’s a good web wallet but I’d always prefer paper wallets or a Ledger for larger sums.
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:44:07
Different countries, different laws, too. *Yawn*
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:15:56
You can go with MEW for a start. But when you’re starting to staple the virtual money bags, you should opt for a Ledger S.
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:56:23
O Canada. Who cares.

OK, I LOLed but that is one dumb comment.
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:54:04
Honestly though, Coini isn’t even available for iOS or Mac OS, so I couldn‘t even use it. LOL. Less platforms = bad. Also, Delta‘s constantly being developed and the devs reply to you personally if you have issues. They have a nice voting system for new functions, exchanges etc. It’s one of the best app experiences I‘ve had overall tbh.
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:58:07
Can you read? I do not own any Android or Windows devices. If you say Coini is better, however, you are ignoring the fact that Delta is constantly being developed and getting better each week. Which makes me doubt that you even used it recently. You gave no reasons why Coini is better, I gave reasons why Delta is good. Try again.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:40:09
Me too. ��
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:16:45
Your initial two posts were about that Coini is better. In your last post, however, I find phrases like "I think" and "I find". That is a difference. It just points out that it's about personal taste which makes your first posts obsolete.
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:42:16
Delta's best. Sry bro.
