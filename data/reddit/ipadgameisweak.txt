Lol, no.  They might be able to send you a jumbled text document but it is not helpful.

How did you get wifi in your barn?

Everything you said is true about securing your coin in that situation.  Somehow your comment reassures me and also makes me more concerned.

I don't like bitcoin due to lack of regulation.  I like bitcoin because it is completely public and therefore everyone is accountable.  Yes I like the gains (not the point), I like the lack of inflation, and I hate the banks and bailouts.  But that lack of regulation statement seems like an unnecessary logical stretch

Governments need to switch to service and regulate.  Corporations need to calm the fuck down and find a moral compass.

HOLY FUCK THESE GUYS ARE FUCKING EVIL

Holy fuck guys.  Paul Krugman is actually pretty on point about most this economics, I haven't read his stance on bitcoin.  But this article starts by describing him as Noble Laureate.  It's the fucking Nobel prize, how can we take an article seriously that fucks up it's opening sentence about one of the most famous awards in the world.

Reeeeally? That is interesting thank you!

We don't care about Yang.  He is a non starter.
@_date: 2019-04-12 20:34:21
No he's literally a traitor.  Maybe he was a true champion of the people but he was compromised by Russia and is now a threat.  He's a fool and him and zuckerberg and eat dicks.

Greedy entitled people profiting off of the defense budget you mean right?  America could be a freaking paradise if they taxed the wealthiest and actually invested in the country.

Hilariously bitcoin is actually a true free market.  The fees will go down when people converting to bitcoin notice and there is competition giving a more reasonable rate.
