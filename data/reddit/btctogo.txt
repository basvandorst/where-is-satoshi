please report this to the dev somehow, don't make it public. As a physicist, I am quit sure it is impossible tough. Maybe I am wrong since I didn't make more than napkin calculation about this!
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:41:56
open source please, otherwise many won't trust it!

wrong, still, you should be carefull, consider that big dip in bitcoin are very huge. if you sold, maybe you invest too much and was not able to accept the loss.
Please consider investing only what you can loose without heartbreak!

Hey, Omnibrain, this is so true, but in the same time there is probably an ideal block size which take into account many factor. I think the one MB or whatever it is right now is quite arbitrary. I is a good time to test new size. I foresee some sane relation between block size limit and the number of user.

it is not useless.  everywhere, energy is needed to do work. securing something is some kind of work so it takes energy. the more energy and time you put in the network the more secure it is. it is not worse than every other form of security you can use. Try to protect something to the extend that it is near impossible to break. think about how much money and work will be needed! it's the sameé

do nothing, people uses what they want, people are not that stupid! I choose to use all SI unit since base 10 is quite nice and easy!
