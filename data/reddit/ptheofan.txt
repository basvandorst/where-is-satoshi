Open source crypto is not about getting rich quickly. What is happening now will not last that long - it's still in it's infancy and thus expected.
Open source crypto is about removing a proven-failed credit-dept system. Instead of bleeding out in an unsustainable economic model that has failed and is currently sustained at great expense (war, extreme poverty, economic slavery, etc.), we dare try new alternatives.
What are you gonna do? Bleed out to certain death or try something new?

I see your point. They care too much about the mainstream wave. To their defense, he just says it’s possible, but in any case, any trust in them is already gone! 
It’s not that I’m against crime fighting, I’m just against unequal opportunity were the rich and big have fancy lawyers and the rest of the populous has laws and crime. 
Thanks for sharing.

There's also Zcash. Was also designed from the ground-up with privacy in mind ensuring the equality of coins - cannot be painted

Looks like they're actually concerned about it ( If you have found something please disclose it. Now given I'm not biased and/or affiliated in any way with either crypto, I just found here the "opposition" turning down your claims ( Guys, innocent until proven guilty and guilty until proven innocent. If neither party has proof of their claims then you're just both full of political crap.
