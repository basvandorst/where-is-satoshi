I love this store and always visit it when in Japan. It’s something I really look toward to on my trip. Knowing that they accept btc is makes it extra special. I think my first btc purchase should will be in this store. I’ll wait till then. Maybe in 2020 when I go there for the Olympics. 
Do Yodobashi camera also accept btc or eth?

Is it me or do others find it confusing and slightly annoying when commas and decimals are interchanged. 
I’d much rather prefer $ 6,394.98 than what’s on display in that pic.

One too many. Only thing this guy did for crypto was pump zcl’s price every now and then.

To make matters worse there’s now a coin called bitcore also. They need to stop using “core” when referring to BTC altogether.

Then put what you can afford to lose. 
When you’re able to show your own portfolio gains it becomes more believable rather than “hey gimme 11k because blah blah blah. “
Money talks bullshit walks.

Now that I think of it maybe they should have the top 10-20 crypto standing in the background while btc kicks the usd down the pit. Just like in the movie.

I don’t believe it. Post a picture showing the funds including the address. Until then this is just click bait.

Also move the funds to a proper cold storage wallet like a Trezor or Ledger. Not some obsolete android phone which will be a pain to boot up in another 5 years or so when the battery dies and spares are non existent. Especially since you’re storing such a significant amount of crypto.

Need exact specs to make more definite improvements. 
Some based on pictures
-that motherboard can do at least 9 cards. 
You’ll need more risers (make sure you feed each 6 pin directly from the psu  into the riser. Polaris cards don’t like sharing) and possible another psu. 
You last 2 cards (if doing all 9 will need m.2 adapters). 
Make sure bios is set to gen 1 and run off integrated gpu if possible. 
Can add fans 120mm ones at the back of the cards to keep them cool. 
Check whatomine.com frequently to see what can be mined based on your gpu model.

I’ll preface this by saying I don’t own any bitcoin right now. Look at the number 1 crypto since 2009. Everything below the number 1 has changed positions for the most part. Which coin is still king of the hill? 
Now I don’t know how long it’s going to take ETH (or whatever the next number 2 coin will be) to make up the 50-60b deficit. Now let’s apply the same logic to coin in number 3 position. See the pattern developing ?
Basically as long as we keep farting around 200-600b in total market cap ain’t nothing going to change much.
