Stop with the whale nonsense, ignoramus.
This was a moving average crossover on the 6hr chart that triggered thousands of traders to close shorts and buy longs all at the same time.  Every jump and dip you see is triggered by market signals.

So, firstly, the Mueller report states there is evidence Trump and company conspired with Russia, so take your disingenuous parroting of misinformation somewhere else.  Secondly, there is a vast difference between being incorrect when attempting to predict future events and being incorrect about basic historical facts and timelines that have already happened.  Trump displays an unwavering, next-level, ignorance on nearly all planes of knowledge.  It takes a particular kind of stupid to defend that.

There is still the possibility of a recovery, but it’s getting slimmer and slimmer.  Sold my trading stack at 9000.  Buying back a little with each dip, but saving the bulk for when the 6hr chart crosses up again.

There's understanding the tech and there's understanding people.  Most people are not out to rip off other people, and presumably the lawyer and client had built a rapport with each other in this case, so the lawyer made the reasonable assumption that his client wouldn't go out and rip him off.

It won’t stay above your cost basis initially.  Too much volatility, and there’s no way to guess which way it will go.  Eventually though, there will be a time when the price never goes below the price you bought at.  That is, unless you sell for a loss.
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:12:39
Well, this guy sold his stack at 9k and has been buying back incrementally since, so the lower it goes the more he buys back. There will be no panic sales from him.
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:08:22
Well, the emotions did keep me from selling at 9900 when I knew (having seen the previous correction from 9700 down to 9000) a correction was eminent after such a rapid upswing, but I was still figuring out how the market behaves in a bullish scenario.  I still have plenty to learn, but this dip will give me a lot more bitcoin to learn with.

The moving averages on the 6h chart are where support stands right now.  After rapid gains, eventually you’ll see a pullback to lower support level as the moving averages catch up.  Once that support level is established it can continue up again.  I had a buy set at 9400 since last Thursday, knowing it would dip again. It may even dip to 8900 on the 1h chart.  I have buys in place there too, in case it does.
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:34:47
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:00:39
Crossovers on the 1h chart are still producing the usual 200-300point spikes, there's no reason to believe a crossover on the 6h won't produce the usual 1000-2000pt spike.
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:32:28
Lol, 6500 was the bottom of the 6hr chart. If you were listening to me, I was saying buy.  Now we’re about to see another down cycle on the 6hr chart (likely).  It may be time to sell.
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:32:18
Hypothetically, lets say you write down 23 words of your 24 word seed, leaving off one word that you commit to memory.  How difficult does that make it to access the address for someone who found those 23 words?  Then, how many words would you need to leave off the list to make it next to impossible for a person who found the list to access that address without knowing the missing words?
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:10:06
We're on a downcycle of the 6h chart, we'll see a lot of "barts" (upcycles on the 1h chart) until one of them causes an EMA crossover on the 6h chart and we enter an upcycle.
@_date: 2018-05-30 11:22:23
Haha, definitely not a marketing attempt here
@_date: 2018-05-24 23:02:16

Set up a sell wall and incremental buys at lower prices, trigger panic selling to yourself, keep pushing sell wall lower. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:16:08
Those jumps are what happens when the market isn’t being manipulated down with sell walls, and normal EMA crossovers are allowed to happen.

If the human and the fish can coexist peacefully, then so can public and private currencies.
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:56:05
So, my strategy for this downswing was to sell my stack at 9000 and for every 250 point drop, buy back a percentage of the stack, then when a market reversal is signalled put the remainder of the stack in, so no matter how far down it goes I have more left to reinvest, which means a portion of what I've got will have been put in at the bottom.
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:04:14
No, there are clear market indicators.
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:14:22
Right, and anything I buy back is more Bitcoin than I sold, and the goal is to increase Bitcoin holdings on every market downturn.
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:43:29
You're going to wait until after the 1000 point Spike to buy?  Dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Should have been buying on the way down.
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:57:11
Mt Gox has nothing to do with this dip on the 6h and probably 1d chart cycles.

Already said I’m well into positive territory.  Can still reduce the break even price in the positive.
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:26:28
So fucking obtuse.
It’s more people placing market buy orders vs market sell orders.  When there are more buyers at a given price than there are sellers, the price goes up and vice versa.

@_date: 2018-05-30 16:52:13
So if they have one word from the list, a person could access your address?  How long would this take?  Without further explanation, I'm assuming you don't really know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:52:20
I would have thought you knew to sell as the 1d EMAs approach crossover.  Have I taught you nothing?
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:58:04
Uh, no, because I read market indicators and predict the spikes of 1000+ and buy in before they happen.  I also predict the big drops and sell a large chunk to buy back at lower prices.  You’re an ignoramus who doesn’t understand market fluctuations, and are at the mercy of people like me.
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:55:28
Perhaps; we shall see.  My purpose in trading is to reduce my break even point, which I’ve brought down by a significant amount since starting.

@_date: 2018-05-06 12:11:10
The pumps and dumps are timed with market indicators, ignoramus.  Just because you’re an idiot doesn’t mean everybody is.  “Whales” is a superstitious term used by people who don’t understand how day traders use market signals to buy in and sell off in mass.
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:27:00
That is something everyone should be paying attention to.  Once the bears run out of coins, the price is going to shoot back to 9k again.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:25:18
FYI, a moving average crossover is literally THE indicator of a reversal in market trends from more people selling to more people buying, or from more people buying to more people selling, thus quite effective in tracking market supply and demand.  It doesn’t take a genius to see how thousands of people (or bots) following these indicators create the big jumps you see when they occur.  Once you figure out how a reversal occurring on one chart impacts the charts above and below it, the market is your bitch.

Potential EMA crossover on the 6h chart would be the reason.  Brings an upward swing of 1000-2000 points.

@_date: 2018-05-11 20:53:58
There won’t be support until the EMAs cross back up on the 1d chart.

LOL. I haven’t shared even the beginning of my strategy with you.
@_date: 2018-05-31 00:44:52

@_date: 2018-05-11 17:50:13
Really?  I sold my trading stack yesterday at 9000.  The EMAs on the 6h and 1d chart indicated a big downswing was about to happen.
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:05:00
It’s a correction on the 6h chart.
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:31:38

@_date: 2018-05-07 00:18:23

@_date: 2018-05-06 11:54:29

@_date: 2018-05-16 10:33:22
Sold my stack at 9k and have been buying back since.  The lower the better.  No margin trading for me though.
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:37:02
Every $100 it drops means more of your sold bitcoins bought by me.
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:46:08
Drops and spikes have literally nothing to do with external factors most of the time.  Movement in the market is directly tied to day traders buying and selling in response to market indicators.  
@_date: 2018-05-30 21:31:12
You’re ridiculously incorrect, but there was a time I didn’t understand market fluctuations, too.  
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:39:11
In a bull market, they share the money new buyers are putting in.  Then they sell off when new buyers stop putting money in, the price drops to entice more buyers.  It’s all very basic math.

Bitcoin will always be there
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:42:28

@_date: 2018-05-12 11:35:22
We could see a big jump today, and maybe the line will only touch and bounce back up.  Impossible to say at this point.
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:26:00
We shall see
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:41:35
No, it’s likely to drop back down to the 7.1 level again this evening as the EMAs catch up with each other on the 1h chart.
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:23:11
One doesn’t need to sell all one has to buy $100 of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-01 01:58:34
Might recover. Good support on the 1d chart. But we shall see.
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:38:50
And baldness, I heard.
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:56:31
LOL. Enough to reduce my break even point by $2000/coin.
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:07:40
You want a real answer, buyers weren’t buying anymore.  We weren’t breaking any higher, so there was a sell off to the short term EMA on the 1d chart where we got support.  Now we’re cycling along at this level trying to entice more buy in.  If it doesn’t happen before EMAs cross on the 6hr chart, we’ll probably see it drop toward the long term EMA on the 1d chart.
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:21:05
Barts on the 1h chart are a good sign because they indicate an attempt by the market to get an EMA crossover on the 6h chart which brings the big upward swings when they happen.  
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:15:17
I’ve bought quite a lot, and will continue to do so.  It’s great, set your limit orders and let the panic sellers come to you.  Use the manipulators to your advantage.

I’ve not got the hundreds of coins it would take to pull it off.  
@_date: 2018-05-28 12:05:22
Market cycles.  Trader activity sets the prices and there is more money to be made in shorts than longs right now.  As we reach the bottom, and shorts start getting burnt, we’ll see traders moving into longs rapidly and the price shoot up again.
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:01:52
Buy the dip, but the big one hasn’t come yet.

@_date: 2018-05-06 11:35:22
If you look at gdax, you’ll see the bounce off the 26EMA on the 6h chart.  It’s below the 12EMA.  It will hang around this level or maybe drop to 9200 or even 8900 until the moving averages catch up on the 1h chart.  Once a crossover happens on the 1h chart, the upwards movement will start again.  I’m doing fine daytrading Bitcoin, thanks.

Dremel handheld engraver.  Literally like writing with a pen.  
Still, a valid marketing point for your product is the ability to change the seed.  Something engraved can only be done once.  However, if somebody gets their hands on it and changes the words or simply dumps the letters, that is an issue you don’t have to deal with if it’s engraved.  Another point is the ability to lock the billfodl shut mitigating the above concern, which I can’t do with my ColdTi without modifying it.  But putting a padlock on a flat card makes it more difficult to hide discretely.  Anyway, there are many options out there and I’ll leave to the reader to make their choices.

With the lightning network, the time is ripe for a "killer app" that will introduce bitcoin to the masses.  Skepticism makes bitcoin stronger, but there is a fine line between skepticism and stupidity.  Right now, it's about building the infrastructure.  
While we may see it pull back farther, enough people are trading it to keep the price over $6000 right now; to say nobody is trading it is stupid.

Easy, how many world currencies are 10yrs old?  How do your USDs and Euros fare in Thailand?  
Your positions assume no further development or adoption will happen in the crypto world.

Put in $250 a week until it’s all in.
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:40:33
Well, that may be one of the not so bright things here, other than yourself.
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:28:54
The interesting thing is that there are enough holders now to keep the market propped above 7k, seemingly.  Every spike seems to create more holders.
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:33:42
Good luck to you getting fellow redditors to short with you.

How many times you planning on posting this?
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:24:13
It’s the timing of the upward movement.  The market is signaling a reversal.  It’s not that little bump we care about, it’s the big one that may come within a day or two, based on market indicators.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:21:55
Actually, you could sell 1 BTC for $6100 as of the time of this comment.  Why post verifiably false information?

If you hitch enough of them together, of course they would.
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:22:08
Difference being now the volume is 5-6x greater than it was at 7500, so support here is much stronger, making shorts a lot more risky.
@_date: 2018-06-14 00:17:36
Hey everybody, I’ve sold all my coins, and the market is going to zero, so please sell all of your coins so I can buy them all cheaper.  Thanks.
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:02:11
Hey guys, I’m shorting at 6500, you should too so I can profit big time.

Yeah right, you’re a new reddit user...tell me something else that’s not true.
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:01:56
That should bring the price up to 9600 at least.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:54:35
Alright, go ahead and do that

Market has to bottom out before it will rise to the top again.  Has to do with moving averages and other factors.

Wow, you’re more clueless than I thought.

Right, but those types absolutely depend on and manipulate the actions of the hive through astroturfing.  
@_date: 2018-06-03 10:55:45
Speculation is moving to the alts, for now, but bitcoin is the only one with any level of public adoption.  The only one with any potential to be accepted as payment for goods and services on a broad scale.  The only one I can walk across the street and buy coffee with in the morning.  The only one with any interesting development happening around it.  
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:25:42
Oh no, I have.  There are a whole lot of astroturfers (redditors for 2 days) coming in from to say this sub is censored without any proof.  Such as yourself!

Thanks for the vast paragraph of ignorance.  Please continue.
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:50:35
Could be the “buying a HODL plate with funds not earned from holding” idea that gave you away.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:53:24
No, it’s the “likely will never see mass adoption” that shows your ignorance.  The utility of a universal currency one can cross borders with and spend anywhere is too great, not to mention the other benefits of a digital currency like bitcoin.  The price may continue to go down as the speculators leave, for now.  But it will continue to grow.
@_date: 2018-06-14 00:22:48
I should be able to buy at least 8x as many coins as I sold then.

All of that is entirely untrue regarding titanium vs steel, and for the cost of the ColdTi and an engraver, which is actually faster than picking out the letters and numbers for your product, you’re still paying $20-40 less.  Good marketing push, but thanks, I’m still using the ColdTi.

Every dip will recover as long as none causes an EMA crossover on the 6h chart.
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:22:46
Well if we get a cross on the 6h, the daily will look even better.

This is an expensive option, cheaper is ColdTi, which is titanium plate you engrave your seed on.

Perhaps you didn’t see this comment I made earlier this morning:  
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:04:53
Most definitely.  You seem to be very unaware of the utility of a universal currency one need not change when one crosses a border.

Okay dumbass, come back when you’ve been a redditor for 10 years.
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:20:21
And apparently you like being an astroturfer.  Good luck with that.
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:05:42
Nice work; there may be a few more in our future, or we may see a jump toward a crossover on the daily chart.  We’ll see.  It’s being as unpredictable as possible.
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:15:16
How much did you leverage?
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:16:15
Too high to be bought and too low to be sold.

Not if 6h crosses,  if it holds until the afternoon, things will get interesting.

The last upswing started with lower volume than this.  
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:34:11
It will until it doesn't.  But it looks better than it has in a while.

Good points, but then we can get into exchanging satoshis for a smaller value token if a satoshi were ever worth too much for an average person to buy (not likely).
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:32:35
Perhaps, but there have been several attempts to trigger stop losses that have failed and whoever was responsible has bought back their sales.  Attempts to wreck shorts haven’t really been working either.  Holders seem to be holding for now.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:37:41
Very few bought the all time high, and even fewer of those held after the crash

Hope those of you with cash on hand are taking advantage of this dip.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:55:18
There are still transaction fees which go to miners.  The idea is that by the time all bitcoins have been mined (~2400AD), there will be enough transaction volume due to mass adoption to keep miners well-paid)
Edit: last bitcoin mined in 2140, not 2400.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:00:25
Don’t ever let it go.  You’ll be able to live off it someday.

Bitcoin is a fiat vacuum.  The more that gets printed the more bitcoin can take in.  No limit on fiat printing? Then there is no limit on bitcoin value.

Don’t pretend you don’t have an agenda.  It’s as clear as day.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:21:37
Supply of new bitcoin is cut in half roughly every 4 years.  Not exact numbers, but currently ~12 new bitcoin are produced every 10 minutes.  After the “halvening” only ~6 will be produced every 10 minutes.  Lower supply with equal or greater demand means higher price.  The supply will continue to be cut in half every 4 years until all 21 million bitcoin are mined, then production stops completely.
@_date: 2019-06-24 21:45:31
Support, you mean
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:03:55
Because one is a scam and the other is bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:02:28
Ah you’re right.  I saw it somewhere but remembered 2410 instead of 2140.

Market movements are market movements.  Look up moving average crossovers, and the mystery of these big swings will disappear.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:01:30
The "copy somewhere else" I agree with, but you want at least one copy that is as indestructible as possible if this is any sort of significant holdings we're talking about.

A sell off like that is because stop losses for thousands of traders got triggered simultaneously.  Not one guy selling all his bitcoin.

Scarcity is the key here.  If a billion people are using 21million bitcoins you do the math.  If 5 billion people are using the same bitcoins, you do the math.  We early adopters are betting on mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:08:05
I believe a bitcoin will be valued near $1,000,000 within my lifetime.  With that understanding, do you think now is a good time to buy more?
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:34:21
Whatever you can reasonably afford.  Use it as a savings account, deposit $10/month, $100/month, whatever.  Just keep accumulating.  It will provide better returns than a bank, guaranteed.
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:58:42
People with fiat who want crypto buy it,  people with crypto who want fiat trade it for fiat.  When the buy pressure is higher than the sell pressure, the price goes up.  When the sell pressure is higher than the buy the price goes down.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:39:12
Buying now and buying later
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:08:20
Your problem is you’re treating it as a get rich quick scheme and not understanding it at all.  Bitcoin is a fiat vacuum.  It can suck up every unit of fiat currency in existence.  Because there is no limit on the amount of currency central banks can print, there is no theoretical limit on the value of a bitcoin.  Once you understand that, you won’t risk losing one Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:21:45
Plan to hold for 4 years, you’ll be fine.
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:28:51

@_date: 2018-03-22 15:07:17
Honestly, I hope it does drop $3000.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:12:02
Except then the demand would go up and then the price as well
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:03:35
Not anywhere close to a comprehensive demand side of the equation.  The demand side is far more complicated than the supply side in the case of Bitcoin.

It’s in the article
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:05:44

@_date: 2018-03-26 13:42:51
Uh huh

Yeah, also useful for getting into the heads of the manipulators
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:11:24
I have a goal to acquire a set number of bitcoins, so the lower it goes, the faster I achieve my goal and the less I have to put into it.

You are objectively incorrect.

@_date: 2018-03-27 22:48:55
If you have $8000 in a savings account, it is a fantastic time to buy a bitcoin.  Only 21million will ever exist, and you should have one while you can afford it.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:51:22
No, it will rise due to real demand placed on it by adoption of the technology.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:58:08
Yes, margin of error is a well-understood aspect of statistical analysis.
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:31:05
They don't buy because they bought high like idiots instead of accumulating with every dip
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:36:50
Don’t be a dumbass.  The ability to effortlessly convert money into and then spend a deflationary currency on anything you can buy with USD will be what will leads to adoption of the currency.  Thinking a few rounds of FOMO will accomplish anything is just stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:58:21
I’m never selling another bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:14:45
Awesome, I’ll be buying those dumped coins.  Thx.
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:25:33
Because there is a limited supply of it and demand is this high.  Basic economics, guy.
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:42:15
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:34:04
If enough people adopt the currency on a daily use basis, the price will go high enough and stabilize to a point where merchants won't need to worry about that sort of thing.  It has to be widely adopted to end this current up down cycle precipitated by the big players.  Early adopters on the merchant end need to view it as the deflationary currency it is and not worry about the fluctuations so much.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:12:17
To say that it can only go up or down ignores all other available axes.  
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:01:50
The catalyst for me is all the development happening around Bitcoin right now.  When Square gets their merchants online, and all these other apps are implemented, nowhere to go but up.
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:53:21
Buy and it will go up
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:15:01
All subsets of demand.

I feel like that will do more than almost anything to increase widespread use of the currency.
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:59:08
Smooth sustainable growth is an indicator of more people adopting, which is what is needed if bitcoin will go anywhere.  A person is a moron if he thinks these ridiculous spikes will go anywhere but down in the long run.

Presumably you posted this comment by looking at a screen of some sort, however.
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:33:57
That too, but really the only thing keeping it from going up is everybody guessing it will go down and trying to outwit each other, shooting themselves and everybody else in the foot.  So much money on the sidelines just waiting to be pumped in at the next sign of a bump...

Waiting for funds to come through
@_date: 2018-03-28 10:22:36
Anybody who doesn't buy right now will regret it in a week.
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:38:00
Obviously it is.  The market price is the market price, which is set by demand.
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:42:33
It's a good time to buy
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:40:10
The average person will never see a full bitcoin in their life.  It is wise to accumulate many now while it is not unreasonable to do so.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:52:40
Glad I bought this morning
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:29:45
Pump and dump, don't fall for it, probably going to double pump this one.
Edit: there's your second pump, time to short
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:21:19
Hope so, I’ve got a big buy to make today
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:00:22
You need not buy $9000 of Bitcoin to get into it.  Buying $100 worth is the same at any price point.
@_date: 2018-03-28 10:17:11
Let's put it on the chainwax.
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:16:38
Or it might be related to profit taking
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:29:34
Well, once the coins are distributed widely enough, anyway, so fewer individuals can swing the price buying and selling stacks of coins.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:11:21
Dump and dump
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:44:55
Pump and dump folks, sell coming within an hour.
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:29:46
Another week.
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:10:35
Because you can't predict the bottom.
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:09:18
Do you own any bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-15 19:00:07
No, liars can go fuck themselves.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:11:16
Both are correct. We're finding middle ground as speculators exit and long term holders step in.
@_date: 2018-03-28 11:12:53
Ah, you
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:33:05
You're a moron if you think the whales are not in the green. They're the ones moving the market down.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:45:36
I disagree.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:18:26
Addicting, yes, but slow growth is better for you. :)
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:36:30
Market manipulation to induce panic selling.
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:13:01
Yeah, didn't mean you specifically, just a general "you."
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:03:49
I've been buying every dip since 9500.  Have accumulated a nice little stash.
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:40:06
Buy the dips, sell the spikes, force the whales to lose on every market manipulation.  The little investors have to be smart to survive.
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:50:17
This is propaganda, pure and simple.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:00:18
This is the time for the little players to snatch up as much as they can to reduce the influence of the big players.  Keep buying small amounts every time it goes lower.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:07:54
Well, that’s not good for the market anyway, as it leads to a much higher percentage of market gains being fed back to governments in the form of capital gains taxes.  Better to hold until you pay lower tax rate, and let the market grow more.
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:22:53
No, it’s a good time to short if you’re into that sort of thing.
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:37:12
Did you see the bump before nightfall came?
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:08:39
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:55:03
Those are the ones the rest of us make money off of.
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:12:07
That's what the chart has looked like all day. Every pump met with sales, every dump met with buys.  All converging on $7950.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:10:05
I'd like to thank whoever it is, because I'm buying a lot of cheap Bitcoin today.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:56:53
Yeah, I was thinking, “it’s been a while since we saw $9000.”  No, it was a week ago.  Feels like years.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:10:19
Today should weed out all the panic sellers.  A lot of money on the sidelines waiting for the bottom.  Tomorrow will be a good day.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:29:38
So you can accumulate as much of a limited resource as possible
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:16:38
There’s no “big companies are evil” narrative from him.  It’s “here are the evil big companies.”  That’s what fucking journalism is.
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:34:01
Impossible, yes, but it's going to go up.
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:49:19
That is how to do it.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:49:08
$100 isn't going to happen, ever.
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:26:43
Guess what guy, I can still buy the dip without doing any of the above.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:37:21
It's a necessary step in adoption
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:42:44
Either way, you win
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:46:38
Time to buy as much as you can
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:42:29
Lol, I'll gladly buy the cheap coins you leave behind!
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:34:49
In other words, question the motives of anybody giving advice freely.
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:07:12
$200-$300 pump coming before nightfall
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:26:27
We're narrowing in on a value somewhere between $7500-9000.  And speculators are leaving the market.
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:34:22
Easily with all the money that's been pulled out and sitting on the sidelines waiting to see the bottom. Such a collection of lemmings.  All in, all out, all in, all out.  Only a few win in that game.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:06:58
You don't owe anything.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:24:34
Turns out $7000 is pretty cheap Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:33:15
The data is posted, so no, the margin isn’t as broad as you state.
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:57:44
He’s selling today.
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:37:12
Obviously, which is why you should only buy dips and only sell after a run.  Whales make money tricking others into panic selling for a loss or tricking them to buy after a pump.  Basic market psychology.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:02:52
When you understand their future value, you will take every drop now as an opportunity to increase your holdings.
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:42:48
I've had good success with WTF and LOL.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:15:36
I care, because it goes up with increased adoption and if only 8 percent are adopting now, that is some massive room for growth.
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:30:23
All in!
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:04:57
This is a great time for the small players to buy up all the cheap coins the big players keep dumping.  The more, the better, as far as I'm concerned.
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:50:35
Prefer to keep it below 9000 for another couple of weeks.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:45:40
Do you not understand how much development is occuring right now around Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:31:13
This is precisely what is happening.  EVERYBODY is taking their profits off the table and waiting for it to go down and stabilize, which means it necessarily will go down. Good news for new investors who should be buying as much as they can while they can because when these dumpers start buying in again it will shoot back up.
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:39:30
And you will be kicking yourself when you can't buy a bitcoin for less than $40,000. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:23:41
A month ago?
@_date: 2018-07-04 13:21:10
Ok, I’m on it.
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:56:53
You don’t have to think it.  You can clearly see the chart data.
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:16:39
Redditors for 3 weeks disagree.
@_date: 2018-07-19 01:11:21
How much more was bitcoin worth 9 months ago than it is now?
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:55:46
Yeah, the big players are bowing out, so until more of them start buying back in, we'll be dropping over and over.
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:33:48
Surprised anybody is selling at this point. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:22:54
It's not dropping because people with weak hands are selling (mostly).  It's dropping because people are taking their profits out of it.
@_date: 2018-07-05 15:43:06
No, it’s not that hard, so you should be able to do it yourself and make bank.  Do it.
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:25:25
That’s what I’m talking about!
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:57:37
What is the value of “moon” in USD?
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:10:14
Could drop to 2k from here, but could be the last time it’s ever below 7k.  Anybody who tells you differently is full of it.
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:28:07
That’s rough.
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:41:05
You’re right, all these homeless bitcoiners need to find places to live.
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:02:34
Uh huh
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:38:40
A handheld dremel engraving pen.
@_date: 2018-07-20 00:38:30
That formation (and other rapid rises or falls) occurs when moving average crossovers trigger traders to buy or sell en mass.  How is this not a commonly understood fact around here?
@_date: 2018-07-05 15:14:06
So you’re probably likely to borrow only if you really need to, eh?  Perhaps you’re beginning to understand.
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:10:06
It would be stupid not to put some money into bitcoin.  Putting all the money into bitcoin would also be stupid.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:24:45
Incomparable, really.
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:43:11
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:41:29
Any big jump or dip is a manipulation at this point.
@_date: 2018-07-05 11:44:07
Borrow 3 BTC, payback 4 BTC.
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:42:40
So, redditor for a day finds the bitcoin sub and posts this.  Interesting how some people spend their lives.
@_date: 2018-07-08 15:52:24
Have the shorters given up for now?  Don't see all the redditors for two weeks fostering ill will and claiming bitcoin is dead today.
@_date: 2018-07-05 13:44:36
What? I didn’t stutter. I’ll loan you 3 BTC today if you pay me back 4 BTC a year from now.
@_date: 2018-07-01 12:07:35
Many alternative tracks.
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:13:41
No, the deflationary currency takes the place of your savings/checking account.
@_date: 2018-07-20 13:22:32
Especially in light of recent events.
@_date: 2018-07-18 23:48:49
This is a common comment for ignorant people.  I’ll loan you a bitcoin if you pay me 1.3 BTC a year from now.  See how it works.  1 BTC is worth 1 BTC.  If I’m loaning you bitcoin I expect payment and interest on that in bitcoin.  It’s not a difficult concept.
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:44:59
Oh ok.  Do it then, redditor for one week, do it.
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:27:58
The price goes up much faster when fewer people are willing to sell at a given price than are willing to buy at that price.
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:24:29
No, they don’t.  If there are no limit sell orders placed at a given price, the market buy orders have to be filled at higher prices.  It’s literally the only way the price can go up.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:38:39

@_date: 2018-04-12 11:30:40
No, I mean I read the 6hr chart reaching the bottom and threw all in.
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:38:51
Next 5-6 hours going to be interesting.  Might be time to buy and ride a wave.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:29:16
No, it crashed because the moving averages crossed on the 15m and 1h charts.  Look at the charts.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:06:12
All the people who took money out at the top are probably putting the money back in now.
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:15:54
Well, for him to buy in, the price will rise for everybody.  His wealth gets shared with the rest of us.
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:19:42
Good luck
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:42:04
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:12:49
I wouldn’t own any if I didn’t.
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:52:48
It was short term moving average crossing below long term moving average on 15m chart triggering a sell off, which triggered stop losses and a further drop.  Then when everybody who realized stop loss was unnecessary had to buy back in, price came up and resumed 1m oscillations at the long term average on the 1h chart.
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:53:54
All these bogus sell walls are hilarious
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:13:27
It dropped because the moving averages crossed.  Its about to begin the next bull wave.
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:21:52
Your last paragraph betrays your lack of understanding
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:29:39
And bingo.  But what do I know about reading charts...
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:13:11
Dumbass, looking at the long term chart, we just hit bottom on the 6hr and 1day charts.  This is a bull market.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:21:20
You get enough people holding .5 coins and “the whales” lose their power.
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:03:08
Study the moving averages.  It's not going up consistently any time soon.
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:47:15
Your traders won’t buy in until the price is $4000 above the bottom, right before it starts to swing down again, at which point I’ll be out.  
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:59:21
2 minutes til 10 EST, should see a jump just after 10 as the 15 min MAs cross over.  Might take til after 10:15.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:43:52
It's not pump and dump.  It's market fluctuations as a result of the interaction between short and long term moving averages on various time scales.  The market oscillates at different frequencies that can be seen on the different charts.  The base oscillation is on the 1m time scale which is 20-40 dollar fluctuations.  The next oscillation is on the 5m time scale with 40-100 point swings.  The next on the 15m time scale swings by 100-200 points, and on the 1h time scale, you'll see oscillations like we just had around 200-500 points.  We haven't seen an upswing on the 6h time scale (which may swing 500-2000 points or more) for a while, but we're nearing the bottom of the curve on that.  To see the curves, look at short and long term moving averages on each chart.  When the short term average crosses over the long term average on the 1hr chart is the time to buy (this will happen when the short term average on the 15m, 5m, and 1m charts are all above their long term averages).  Knowing when to sell is trickier, but basically it's when it's clear the short term average on the 6hr chart will not cross the long term average on that chart (because if that happens and you sold early, the market will jump 500-2000 points up and you won't ride it).  Now, watch the market for a few days and see if it doesn't all make sense, and if you can't predict if it will go up or down at any given time.
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:22:31
I spent two days watching the 1m 5m 15m 1h charts and it clicked.  The market oscillates at different frequencies and amplitudes. 20-40 point swings on the 1m chart, 40-100 point swings on the 5m chart, 100-300point swings on the 15 minute chart, 300-500point swings on the 1h chart, 1000-? point swings on the 6h chart.  Whether it swings up or down is dependent on the moving averages on each chart.  On GDax for example the averages are on 12 and 26 point intervals. If the short term moving average on the 1m chart is above the long term then it will push the average higher on the 5m chart.  As long as the short term on the 5m chart is above the long term, the 1 min will rise and dip, almost always recovering, until the moving averages catch up with each other on the 5m chart.  Then the 5m may oscillate back up or jump down.  If it goes down, but the short term moving average remains above the long term on the 15m chart it will recover.  However, if the 5m dive pushes the short term below the long term on the 15m chart it will cause a bigger dive.  Then what happens on the 1 hr chart becomes important because if the short term moving average is above the long term there, the 15m cycle will recover and swing up again.  All the charts interact with each other, and since I figured this out, I’ve predicted every jump and dip (on the 1hr and 6hr charts) and the amplitude of the jumps and dips within a day of them happening.  I think of it as similar to the function of electron orbitals.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:36:04
Watch and learn.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:13:43
The only support is with the holders.  There are enough to support the price at ~6500.  The rest of the people in bitcoin are traders and speculators who want a quick buck and will put their money all in or all out depending on which direction the price is moving, so you won’t see stability at 9000 until the number of holders increases to support that number.
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:44:06
Like I said, the timing of the rise is tough.  There was a big selloff after I said it would rise, so the line didn't cross where it was expected, but it came this morning.
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:27:36
Not that time.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:36:27
Won’t happen until the short term moving average crosses the long term on the 6hr chart.
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:01:54
I’ll not interfere.
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:35:26
We hit "a" bottom yesterday, on the 6hr chart.  It's likely to trend up from here.
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:04:10
The short term moving average is still above long term on the 6hr chart, so no.
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:47:58
It depends on what the other charts are doing.  Lol
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:23:25
The averages have to come up first.
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:50:40
Um, no.  I’ve been trading those spikes and dips in response to market signals for significant profit.  If “whales” are doing it, they’re forecasting their moves ahead of time, which seems silly to me.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:05:44
There are many like you.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:51:58
Only when moving averages cross on the 15m chart
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:09:22
Remember what I said.
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:27:48
Hint: study moving average crossovers.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:10:15
Profit taking
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:45:11
If the short term moving average crosses the long term on the 6hr chart, this could go past 8000. This one is different from the others.  
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:50:22
Reversal on the 1d chart.
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:12:49
9000 is going to stick one of these pushes.
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:27:11
Was obviously joking, but brewing your own, you could probably do a year’s worth for &lt;$50.  Depending on ones level of alcoholism...
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:20:49
Lol, you keep thinking that.
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:35:27
Hmm, old worthless article, much?
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:19:17
Depends on if it keeps going down or hits enough resistance to cycle up again.  It’s at least a dip for now.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:53:16
What does CNBC have to do with anything?  I can look at the charts on any given day at any given time and tell you what to the market is about to do on several time scales.  Not about to explain how to read charts to a disrespectful dipshit like you on the internet.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:58:44
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:48:03
I should say, I think there will be small dips on the way up that should all recover to previous levels until the 1day chart sees the short term average cross down over the long term.  That can happen very suddenly though.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:39:55
Check the 1hr chart, we're about to ride a wave
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:29:18
Lol, you think 200EMA and 55EMA have anything to do with what’s going on RIGHT NOW.  That’s cute.
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:42:19
Watch it continue to rise.
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:53:38
Unnecessary panic selling by many many traders.  Stop losses triggered on the dip.
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:55:02
So do I
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:42:14
Citation needed.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:08:18
I understand the charts.
@_date: 2018-04-23 19:55:56
Heading down to 8825 for everybody who still wants to get in to jump in.
@_date: 2018-04-21 01:48:08
All indicators right now indicate it should keep going up for a bit, but it’s never a guarantee.  I think it will swing down again, but not until the moving averages cross on the 1day chart, which could be a very long time.  Look up moving average crossover trading strategies.  I’m still all in at this point.
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:32:43
It’s not random when you know what to look for.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:22:38
No, the 6hr chart hit a bottom yesterday.  This is traders buying in mass because they know it’s going up for a while.
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:31:00
As long as they’re able to continue making money, they’ll buy at higher levels and sell at higher levels, which requires new money coming into the market to feed the traders.  When money is being taken out, the traders want to buy at lower levels and will sell at lower levels out of desperation.
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:16:38
As long as the short term moving average is above the long term moving average on the 6 hour chart, every dip you see will recover to the level it was previously at.
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:21:41
It might, but not likely this month.
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:18:09
Just a bunch of stupid fuckers with their stop losses set at 8200 who will now have to buy back higher.
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:17:44
I actually almost sold when I saw that dip start, but forced myself not to hit the button based on that crossover info I shared previously.  So hard to trust when you see it dipping like that.  You can see everything I said happening right now.
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:54:52
Could be any time now.  Only 100 points off 7000 on the initial upswing.
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:40:40
These artificial sell walls popping in and out of existence multiple times a second are getting more than a little annoying.
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:55:55
Did $1000 because the 6hr chart bottomed out and traders responded to the cue.  Won’t have another jump like that without another cue (crossover on the 1d chart).
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:01:50
Ok, I am the market and I’ve decided BTC is bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:21:00
Welp, guess it’s time to sell it all then, derp derp derp
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:39:44
Well, you'll almost certainly see it that high again eventually
@_date: 2018-04-10 03:02:05
So if you go to gdax and look at the charts there are charts for 1 minute, 5 minute, 15 minute, 1 hour, 6 hour, and 1 day intervals.  It gives you the option to overlay the moving averages onto the chart.  You want to see both long-term and short-term.  As the price fluctuates up and down you can see points where the short term (red) crosses above and below the long term (gray).  When the red crosses above the grey on the 15m chart you see an uptick in buying because that signifies a market upturn and the daytraders buy in to make their profits.  As the red drops below the gray you see a lot of selling as the daytraders know the market is done going up, so they sell out to buy the next upswing.  When these reversals happen on the 1hour, 6hour, and 1 day charts you get massive movements up and down as more people buy in on a long term reversal than on the shorter term reversals.  Whales don't exist doing the things the ignorant individuals here think they do to swing the market up and down.  These are just daytraders who contribute to mass buy ins and sell offs when the market reverses on different wavelengths creating these swings.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:33:03
Yes, because I know when to pull it all back out so I don’t lose the gains I make on the upswings.
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:15:15
The key here being will it recover before the averages cross on the 1hr chart, or will it cause a crossover?  If it crosses down there, we see another dip, if not, we see it start to rise again.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:48:30
Roger that
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:38:20
I disagree, we're nearing the bottom of the curve.
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:14:38
I don’t doubt it, but anything over 100 is rare on gdax.
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:53:51
I threw all in yesterday, and I feel like it’s ready to blow up.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:27:37
It might stabilize here and make another run at the 6hr moving average crossover.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:49:38
You are my witness.  Nobody else here believes me.
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:15:13
So $10
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:00:25
No, the more distributed the coins become the more difficult it becomes for a single player to alter the value.
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:12:41
If it can maintain above 6820 for another hour or two, we should see it jump.  May not have approached the line steeply enough this time so we might wait for the next cycle.  There's definitely a lot of resistance right now.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:16:19
Crickets? There is a goddamn battle going on right now.
Or did you mean crickets in this sub?
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:04:13
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:36:48
One or two more oscillations on the 15m frequency.  Can't predict when it will happen exactly, and might jump back down to ~6800. Keep watching the charts.  The market oscillates at several wavelengths and when the oscillations match up is when you see jumps from one level to the next.  Feel free to doubt.  I'll keep on making money.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:55:27
You'll see a lot of small dips and larger dips, and each one will recover until the 6hr chart peaks.
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:52:11
What's going to be really interesting is when the short term moving average crosses above the long term on the 6hr chart, which we're getting close to.  Almost happened in the last upswing, but broke back down.
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:40:23
Everybody all in!
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:26:25
It’s driven by the buying at one price and selling back on ~$40 higher increments at the lowest (fundamental 1min) oscillation. Bots and day traders.  You can see it clearly with the bathtub that sloshes back and forth between buy and sell walls set about 40-50 points apart after a big jump.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:33:46
What you saw was a dump and buyback if you look at the chart.
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:10:49
Yeah, ran out of momentum after the bump on the 5m chart previously and crashed against the sell wall at 8050.
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:10:11
I'm using the gdax chart so when the orange line crosses above the grey. 12 and 26.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:54:06
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:26:34
1d chart should be enough indication.
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:15:31
Out of somebody’s driveway?
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:57:00
So right now, we've reached an oscillation on the 1m scale and you'll see it going up and down 20-40 points at this level until a jump in one direction or the other, likely upward because the short term moving averages on the 5m, 15m, and 1h charts are all above the long term moving averages.
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:12:00

The market moves on market trades.  People reaching across the gap to buy because people aren’t reaching across the gap to sell, they’re holding onto their coins.  If more people are reaching across to buy, the market moves up, and vice versa.

It's not totally dominated by short term traders.  There are enough holders to keep the price above 6000 when all the day traders duck out.  But otherwise I do agree.

Precisely, and they won't run the price down so far that their stacks of coins become worthless.

This comment in particular. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:26:20
When indicators decline, you see big dumps because traders take money out of the market to let it fall and buy back low.
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:57:55
Regardless, I sold and will buy on the dip.
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:58:36
No, and if you think it is, you shouldn't be day trading.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:47:01
This is a market swing on the 6hr chart.  Seeing that coming is why Soros decided to buy in when he did (presuming he did buy in), but the swing was going to happen with or without him.

Cross isn't clear enough yet, but buy pressure is increasing
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:53:34
When it was clear the 6hr chart had bottomed out, there was a mass buy in by all traders, and sellers stopped selling.
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:54:38
It’s going to continue up, there will be many dips, and each will recover to the prior level.
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:20:53
Do you think these rises and falls are the actions of a couple of people buying and selling?  No, they are the actions of thousands and thousands of traders responding to market cues, buying and selling in unison trying to beat each other to the punch.

Watch the short term moving average crossover the long term on the 1hr chart, and watch the price go up when it happens.

Snappy comeback, snappy comeback
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:01:35
No, we'll hit a point where the big money decides it's time to throw in again.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:08:24
It will take a few days, if it comes.  Looks like we might be hitting the bottom of the 1day chart, which means we’ll be in a true bull market, so no more giant dumps.
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:43:00
Reading the charts
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:10:09
When short term moving average on 1hr chart crosses the long term, we'll shoot back up over 7k.  May happen today or tomorrow.  Watch the charts.
@_date: 2018-04-18 00:08:16
That’s how markets work.  Some new money comes in, pumps up the price, day traders swap it back and forth until they reach an equilibrium, then either a bunch of people throw more money in or take it out to take the price to a new level.  Over and over.  
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:54:52
Check YouTube for moving average trading strategies.  Better explanations than I can give.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:02:51
This is traders responding to market cues.  Absolutely not manipulation.
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:09:58
We hit the bottom of the 6hr chart (moving averages crossed over) and might hit the bottom of the 1 day chart. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 05:20:06
Can we crush this wall at 8050?  
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:50:40
The timing may be vague, but the fact of it jumping up to the higher level was inevitable.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:04:03
Give it a minute, big downward manipulation last night to delay the cross
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:04:32
Hope you were buying more on the way down to avoid having to get all the way back to 16k before you’re in the green.  Dollar cost averaging is your friend if you’re not day trading.
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:04:45
It’s capped at “priceless.”
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:44:13
No, it was 160 coins that jumped simultaneously from 8850 to 8880 and several other values, purposely avoiding the mid market price.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:21:02
Or maybe Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny.
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:28:30
This was a crossover on the 6hr chart, which gave us the 1000 point upswing. Read my comments in r/bitcoin from the past week, and see if the market doesn't make more sense.  
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:50:58
Probably a lobster trap, actually.  Be super careful.
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:42:53
That’s how markets work, bro.  That’s how movement occurs.  It’s a constant back and forth push between people trying to buy at one price and sell $20 higher.  The wave builds on one side and retreats on the other then builds and retreats.  All day long.  When equilibrium is reached, tension builds until somebody gives.  Then everybody panics, buys or sells at whatever price they can get, and then the whole process starts at a new price point.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:25:28
Wasn’t out of nowhere. I sold this AM in anticipation.  Bought back at 7870.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:51:16
Perhaps I will be.  Perhaps nobody else knows.  I figured it out watching the charts nonstop for two days, and it clicked.
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:31:10
On the 5m chart, when the short term moving average dips below the long term, we'll see a drop of 50-150 points then it should climb back up, as the 15m short term will still be above the long term, and every drop we see in that cycle will climb back up until the short term moving average on the 1h chart dips below the long term moving average there. Then the oscillations will dip down in the mid 6000s again.  That's what I see when I look at the charts.  We're still on a downswing on the 6h chart and the 1d chart, hence why the overall trend will continue downward, and I believe people should be taking advantage of the oscillations on the 1h cycle, if so inclined.
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:54:23
This was not the one to sell on
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:33:58
Is this not the Bitcoin sub?  Is his post not about Bitcoin?  What is it about your personality that led you to make this post?  Is there anything else we should all know?

?  That’s exactly what happened yesterday, right after I posted the comment.
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:20:35
Fair enough.  Long term, I see it continuing to dip toward 6000 before it stops these downward swings, but we'll see it turn bullish within a month or two.  Keep watching the 6hr moving averages.
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:56:52
It’s caution while waiting for the 1d chart to crossover.  When moving averages on the 1d chart shift, your guess is as good as mine on the top.
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:30:09
Yeah, you're doing alright
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:41:58
These fluctuations are due to day traders responding to market cues in mass, not massive buys or sells of individuals.  I sold this morning right before it crashed and plan to buy this afternoon as the short term moving average crosses above the long term moving average on the 15m chart.  These are facts.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:56:21

Bunch of clowns getting squeezed into selling.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:05:40
The buying cue for traders was the bottom of the 6hr chart, which triggers a big upswing because all sellers stop selling and all buyers start buying at the same time.  These jumps aren’t 1 guy deciding to buy or sell all his coins.

@_date: 2018-04-10 13:35:14
Knowing when to sell is the tricky part, as greed and the uncertainty of how much it could go up will keep you in it too long and you won't be able to make a sell before the market drops.  Trade on paper before using real money (give yourself an imaginary purse of as much as you plan to put in and make some imaginary trades for a few days/weeks). Then, realize in real life it's harder to make your buys and sells at the prices you want than you'd think, as you need to avoid fees as much as possible.  Requires predicting how much the market will swing so you can set up the transactions ahead of time.  There are also more market cues to pay attention to than I can go into detail on, but there are a lot of YouTube traders you can check out if seriously interested.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:09:21
It likely will go down again, but you shorted at the beginning of this upswing, which is a bit early.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:21:12
Soros got in because there was a swing coming on the 6hr chart.  
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:29:01
Look at the size of the bars on the 6 hr chart.  Market appears to be reaching equilibrium.  Will be interesting two days from here to see where we go.

Hey, you ready to revisit my assessment?  It’s early yet, but let’s check the price.
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:23:15
It looks like the 5m and 15m charts are more important than the 1h when the 6h is on an upswing.  Watching closely now as we hit the bottom of the 5m dip.
Edit: some clown downvoting me.  Watch the jump as the moving averages cross on the 5m chart.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:05:17
Dude, it moved up strongly as a push to get the 6hr short term moving average over the long term, when that didn't happen everybody ducked out to buy back lower.  I was one of those people.  It's normal market movement.
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:02:25
The short term moving average is about to cross the long term moving average on the 1hr chart indicating the start of an upswing on that oscillatory cycle.  The last upswing there took us to 7500 and ended on the 4th.
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:50:11
Momentum seems to be accelerating.  I’d like to see it over 9000 tomorrow.

Adoption is key here.  If the merchants begin to accept all crypto then that's one thing, but if they only begin to accept Bitcoin then the value of the others will be sunk.  Bitcoin is well ahead of the pack in terms of adoption right now.

We wouldn’t want anybody doing drugs

It is very unfortunate we didn't cross over there, though.

Yes, look at moving averages on 6hr chart; short term crossing over long term in the next few hours, potentially.  Start of a big wave if that happens.
Edit: didn't happen, everybody cleared out

It was interesting.  Market heavily minipulated downward to avoid the cross, but the buyback is coming.  Should be over 7000 by midday. Definitely time to buy now.

You want manipulation, that 160 coin sell wall at 8850 is fucking manipulation.

I saw this 2 days ago.

Shorts getting rekt.

Cool story, Mr 99% bull trap.

What about a rally and rejection at $5400?  What about that, genius?
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:05:46
The rise was a buy in when the short term moving average on the 1hr chart crossed the long term moving average.  Big buy in at that point because everybody was hoping to push the 6hr short term moving average past the long term, which would lead to a bigger jump.  It didn't cross, so when that was clear, everybody sold to buy back lower.

Stop loss hunt, trying to trigger shorts closing, and failed.
