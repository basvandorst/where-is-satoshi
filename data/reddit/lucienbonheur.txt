I'm in Paris and I use bitcoin, no problem. You need the regular id verification to use services like coinbase or exchanges, but I got my credit card and bank account verified easily. Local bitcoin is also an option.

I had sub euro fee transactions clear in less than half an hour the other day.... Serious I'm happy with that.

Havent done it but on hw wallets when you load your keys in the new wallet, it will just create a clone. The original wallet can still be used.
Hope you have a pin or pass phrase on your wallets. If so, you should be relatively safe. Is there a feature like on the ledger where it self destructs if 3 wrong pins are entered consecutively?

When all the coins are sold, 1 btc = 1 btc

Interestingly nobody mentionned the old historical trick of writing keys on your head... Shave head, tattoo key on top, wear a cap while hairs grow back.

Digging a ditch has no value until someone finds a use for the ditch.
The value is in the use case, which bitcoin has plenty of.
