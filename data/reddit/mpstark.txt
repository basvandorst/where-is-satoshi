Cash going out of style is a little far off.
And sure, buying for cash may be a little bit harder and more expensive. But it's mostly anonymous. Which is what you asked.

Bitcoin is not anonymous by itself: you're absolutely right, each public key (address) will have their full history available by the sheer workings of Bitcoin. However, your identity doesn't have to be tied to the public key of your wallet. Now, in most cases, it is in some way -- you bought bitcoins through a company that likely has stored your information and tied it to your method of payment (credit card, bank wire, etc.) or user account on their site or you've linked addresses together by transferring to and from different addresses.
It *can* be anonymous by generating a fresh address and buying or mining bitcoins into that address in ways that do not link you to the new bitcoin address. Tools to let you do this are Tor (properly setup) and anonymized VPN's (again, properly setup) along with buying bitcoins from individuals with cash or other anonymous transactions.
**tl;dr:** Bitcoin *can* be anonymous by not linking your identity with your public key address.

There is nothing about being anonymous. Google is not trying to ***trick*** you. They already have what they want -- your information and ad preferences.
