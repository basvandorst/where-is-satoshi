The real impact will come from non-technical folks who were testing the waters.  Even if there is 0 reality to Gox's statements, the price will dive over the next day as the world processes this.  Negative headlines grab eyeballs.  Expect a lot.

Deep breath everyone.  Timeline this out.  If you think BTC will be worth less one year from now, you shouldn't buy it at any price.  If you can't afford small drops in its fluctuation, you shouldn't be buying.  Everyone else, celebrate the buying opportunity.
Also, cold storage is great but it's also an operational hassle.  Other exchanges and services are not MtGox.  Trust companies with VC funding and real names attached to them.  Judge them based off of their track records (MtGox's was horrendous for years).
To the M^o^o^o^o^o^o^n^!

OP please post your address.
So much dumb FUD.  Your enthusiasm is reinvigorating.

Do you have any source for the bitscalper incident?  I'm not intimately familiar with it.

I was the caller a few months back and sent him his first bitcoin donation.  I stayed on the line and spoke with the producers about getting them set up to accept donations generally.  Being the sharp folks that they are over there, they were pretty keen on learning more, so I set up a conference call with Coinbase's head of business development, introduced everybody, and helped to get things up and running.
I think that over time Adam (and possibly Dr. Drew) will become great proponents of bitcoin/cryptocurrency.  This will take time but the more folks who call in to pledge bitcoin donations on the air, the faster they will want to learn about what this whole math money invention really means.
If anyone is unfamiliar with Adam and Dr. Drew, check out some classic loveline or the Adam and Dr. Drew show ( and   They've helped a lot of people over the years, especially troubled teenagers with no one else to call, with some of the most intimate and important questions and crossroads of their lives.  For each caller with some intense, personal (and frankly, often hilarious) question, there surely were hundreds of other people with the same quandary.  
If you're one of the people who have benefited from the thousands of hours of advice and entertainment these guys continue to provide, toss them a few bits of coin.  If you're not, start tuning in and GET IT ON!

Looks like the tweets from redditors helped convince Joe to have a look at Andreas.  I'm sure that Stefan will be back again in the future too and hopefully they talk about bitcoin.  Good times.

Does anyone know if the machine is transparent with how fees are calculated?  Is it checking a particular exchange and marking up a given percent as a service charge or is the user just presented with an exchange rate and no further information?

Anything ~$625 is a good buying opportunity in my book.
There isn't anything structurally wrong with bitcoin, volatility has been declining overall and the markets have already shown good resilience to this 'news'.
There are too many early adopters who have already taken fiat profits for the floor to drop far below $600 for long.  Bitcoin millionaires have seen gox flops in the past (buying afterwards is how some of them became millionaires).

Some folks, like Andreas Antonopolous, understand the nuts and bolts of bitcoin better than the rest of us.  Stefan Molyneux understands the philosophical implications of bitcoin much better than the rest of us.
I love learning from conversations like these.

This NSF grant reminded me... is anyone aware of the current status of bitcoin foundation grants?  The last mention I can find of them is here: 
I didn't see anything obvious on their site or on their forums.  I know that the developer of CoinPunk received a living expenses grant for three months but does anyone know of other projects that received grants from BF?

'Remember this is digital money backed by, well, no one.  ”Bitcoin exists because we believe it exists,” said CBS4′s David Sutta.  “Absolutely. It’s just like Santa,” Bustamante said.'
Bitcoin. It's just like Santa.
