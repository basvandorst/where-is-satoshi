So who would pay for it?  Only exchanges make money off of trades... I guess would have to be them.

I rarely post but what part of “Tether and market manipulation drove the spike late 2017/early 2018” do people here not understand?   There are no patterns in an unregulated scam filled marketplace.  Only manipulators and bagholders. Which are you?

A completely made up date...can you really not see what poor investment strategy you have and advocate?

IF you think whales sit and watch 80% of their value drop..yikes....no whale HODl's...you are a cringy dude
I can only hope you used your crystal ball and convinced oyur family members to buy BTC.  I bet they made you sit at the kid's table...lol

You know who isn't here?  Anyone who made millions over the last year.  They cashed out and are driving their lambos.   Can they be given a negative number?
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:03:12
I hope oyu are actually doing what you purport to....if so just know one person sees infinite justice in you losing money daily...

Daily Hopium!!!
No one here bought bitcoin when it was $1.00.  I did....but i didn't do it to invest. I did it to buy an advantage (a weapon) in an MMO  called ArcheAge.  I wanted to buy an item against the "tos" but it was $1000 and paypal wouldn't facilitate it so we used bitcoin.  It was fine as an anonymous way to beat the system.
Last Thanksgiving all we could talk about was Bitcoin and alt coins.  It was pure fomo.  Thanks to gemini being so backed up for new accounts i wasn't able to transfer $100,000 over to buy BTC and some altcoins.
But then i began doing research.  The altcoins were all basically GoFundMe accounts with no responsibility or accountability.  This was the first thing that caught my attention.  My justification for Bitcoin was that you HAD to use Bitcoin to purchase altcoins.  BUT if the altcoins were crap then why need Bitcoin besides for the original reason I used it....as alternative nefarious fiat?  And if Bitcoin was currency then the last thing I wanted was for it to gain AND lose value.  I don't pay for my coffee with Apple shares.  Why would I?
Again, none of you were the "strong hands" that rode BTC to 20k from $10.  If you did that and didn't sell when you were worth millions then yikes.  I know I will never buy BTC.  And i know my relatives and friends are long done with it.  It is not some secret anymore.  I would let these folks who have been buying since 13k continue to kindly buy your BTC as you keep what you can while you can.

The\_physicist and cryptogrip are the biggest trolls.  Imagine if anyone has followed their amateur advice and actually bought from 8k down.  Maybe they enjoy making people lose money.  It is one thing to invest your own money but to try and convince others to do the same to support your position is reprehensive.  They should be removed.

This makes no sense....you want people to dump causing your investment to lose money while you Hodl?
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:37:52
Of course they will...commodities etc will always be around.  This is just more lucrative at the moment BECAUSE of the hodl'ers and "revolutionaries" who insist on being the bag holders.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:08:49
This makes zero sense.  When bitcoin took off was when there were the most altcoins.  In my opinion, one of bitcoins major attractive uses was that you had to buy bitcoin to buy altcoins.  Now that peopel are finally recognizing that altcoins are scams, the use for bitcoin has shrunk considerably.
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:05:33
You seem triggered.  Don't worry no one gives a crap about you and other lemmings who watch two years of gains disappear.  I and others post for the new guys who haven't made a horrible decision and invested in pure Multilevel marketing/aamway/get rich quick scheme.  They all had some "it's for the good of all" hook and suckered folks in.  We NEED HODLers to allow smart people to get out with some residual.  
Blockchain tech doesn't give two craps about you and its use is dubious at best.  The number of companies using it for currency has dropped 70%.  The altcoins are all dying (as they should) and they are what propped bitcoin up because you needed bitcoin to buy them.

20k to 3k is what?   A really really sick person spiral?
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:06:45
I was thinking more the millennial' beanie baby...but otherwise spot on

No.  It is not like putting it back in the hands of the people....It is like putting it back in the hands of the cavemen/pirates.  Look at what is happening at the exchanges.  People trying to store value in crypto and losing/ forgetting their access information, not unlike burying it on a desert island and forgetting where out of fear of someone stealing it.  Exchanges where deposits and withdrawals take ages to process or phishing schemes steal information from the careless or uneducated.  If your dream comes true what will happen to the young or poor who don't possess the means to pay cash for cars or homes?  Who will back credit cards and loans?  
More importantly all these coins are are at best a go-fund-me round for development.   Well Bitcoins' fund raising ended years ago...there is no new money flowing into the developer coffers and we know this particular version of block chain needs a lot of work to be functional.

A cumulative acceptance of reality...

Lol....Redditor for a week means he hasn't lost money.
You however, redditor for three months,  you got wrecked son...no wonder why so salty.
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:26:19
And you commented...which shows that time on reddit increases daily while stupidity is forever...

It is NOT gold...stop deluding yourself.  It has ZERO intrinsic value and honestly use.  I wear gold...we use gold to make functional items...it has value within currency and outside of it.  It is a visible symbol of wealth and power.  Gold has been recognized as having extrinsic value for over 4000 years.  Just because you assign a value to something new does not come close to making it gold.  It is a token at best.

None...almost put in 100k but Gemini took so long to register I had time to think it thru

I want the best for all of you.  But I can't see this going up anytime soon.
1.  Average millennial/tech person becomes aware of Bitcoin/Altcoins prior to Thanksgiving.  Big discussion and FOMO over Thanksgiving tables
2.  Come Christmas discussion continues and FOMO builds harder...many buy in above 14k.  They also invest in altcoins.
3.  Market drop...they get burned.  Most of that money that drove the rise is out and out for good.
4.  Those who invested in altcoins realize what a scam most of them are.
5.  What is the discussion today at Easter?
