so if Vic was the only one pushing for Bitcoin integration and now he's gone, there likely isn't anybody advocating for Bitcoin at Google Wallet anymore :(

What are the chances that a broker like Schwab would let regular investors trade on the ETF on day 1? Is that pretty common ?

dont worry about the support team with native speakers. most will be okay with getting support replies in English or Google Translate. They will like a translated website but won't really expect native speakers for support.

People don't like to read. It's unfortunate but true. You can have a detailed step by step but most will see it and say screw that and close the window.

That's the problem. There really isn't a way to get into the VC/MC/Amex system without huge partnership. If Bitcoin were to jump in here somehow, it would still need to be tied to a fake CC number for it to work with the existing system. Yes, NFC might be a standard, but the transaction system is the important part, not NFC.

I also have a TD Bank business account. You should change it to the lower level where all you need is $1,500 in the bank to waive the maintenance fees. 
You are basically paying for funsies at this point.

what happens when our revenue can't keep up with the interest payments?
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:35:40
thank you. I thought we were much worse, but I see now that we are much better than I thought. I do want to give you newer outlook on the data though. 
 Seems we are at about 13% right now. Still, a long way to go as you said.

Got it. Say I do have bitcoins in mtgox. Can I transfer the coins out to another wallet? Not $ just bitcoins. Thanks for the info. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:26:21
well, i was thinking more of sticking pure bitcoin transactions and then just cash out in the future. so, buy from btc-e (low per BTC) and then sell that on Mt Gox (high per BTC) and keep the difference. Do that a couple of times and you just made some risk-free BTC along the way, no?
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:46:43
So they won't let you just take out bitcoins out of the exchange ? Only their fake credits or cash?
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:10:18
do they not let you cash out in bitcoin? move the bitcoins from Mt Gox to BTC-e?
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:56:48
couldn't he take the money in 100 BTC batches to BTC-E (Russians they don't care about anything), exchange to LTC (no more trail for people to follow), exchange back to BTC, go to CoinBase and $$ in the bank? Let me know how if I am mistaken by this, but I don't think you can follow through BTC &lt;&gt; LTC exchanges, right?

Have you visited their website recently? Even by mistake ? If so they are re-targeting you. Very easy and common thing in online marketing.
