I hope most people here understand that this has been their goal all along, it's just that we have been saturated with imminent doom stories and are effectively desensitized to them and now they need a different angle. 
Best of luck, explaining a few hundred million hard working people that bitcoin has to fail because it would hurt a few rich bastards doesnt seem like the bright idea but perhaps it is only the cognitive dissonance between the elite and the herd at work and it is part of our evolutionary struggle for freedom.

First of all. Nothing has intrinsic value. Literally nothing. Intrinsic value of a cow? 2million calories or a divine creature? Intrinsic value of the dollhair? An aggressive government which can project violence anywhere on the planet but which could easily be disrupted by adversaries or from within?  
Gold has little industrial use since it is so brittle, silver could become more valuable if technology permits it. 
I guess you are new to the crypto space.
Tell me. In 50 years when we are hauling chunks of gold back to earth orbit, what will be the value of gold? Do you think we will find 'new' bitcoins on the darkside of the moon too? 
Using cryptography to ensure scarcity is brilliant. Arguably **infinitely** superior to metal chunks or rare gasses which are **infinitely** more available than bitcoin in this universe and which need more energy to collect and maintain.    
But sure you know everything about the btc and how it has no intrinsic value because we should all listen to you and say currency currency currency and not use it as a store of value instead I should primarily use it to pay for my rent. Sure. Hope it works out for you.

For everyone talking about the big bad ol' guvments trying to ban bitcoin, you are wrong.
Governments might have an intrinsic need to destroy bitcoin their initial need to compete with others in controlling this disruptive technology is ever greater, especially with more and more money involved. Meaning that governments are too busy beating eachothers heads over who gets the say than that they can effectively group together to destroy this common enemy. Look at stopping nuclear arms, stopping climate change etc.

Its value is not exclusive to its use. The store of value function works well while market sentiment is that bitcoin can act like gold. Arguable, the pros of using btc over gold will only be made more evident as governments become increasingly oppressive and more willing to apply censorship and deceit to secure its own survival.
We live in an age where tech like btc is proof why the current system is nearing its extinction and ultimate demise.

Not only are you a trading god, you have been ordained with the ability to see the future. You are like that fat black lady in the matrix who happens to know whats gonna happen next. 
My god... drug cartels are already winning because people dont stop using drugs and the government keeps their profits healthy by making it illegal to produce &amp; distribute. 'Prior-military' has been disciplined and drilled to stay in fucking line which they will like the cannonfodder they were created to be. Cops are not gonna do something crazy, they are currently the ones keeping you from doing crazy things. Violent offenders constitute less than half a percent of the entire population do you think the other 99.5% should be afraid of them?
Btc would be less worthless than the phony debt based usd, of which the primary proprietor and the central authority, the federal reserve, would definitely fare less well in the case of a sudden collapse of the US government. In fact most probably btc wouldnt be worthless in the improbable case the government does collapse, since people would be scurrying to buy up foreign currencies, commodities like gold and silver and crypto currencies trying to salvage their usd value which would then lead to souring prices...
