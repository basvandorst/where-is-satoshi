Yeah, it's a bit anticlimactic to have absolutely no need for a larger block size after forking over a dispute about increasing block size.
It's certainly no surprise, but it's kind of like buying a big new vault to store all my cash, but spending most of my cash on the big new vault...

If you're holding more than 5% of the daily volume of litecoin, yeah it could be hard to make the exchange without affecting the market. Otherwise, I think you're a bit off base.
I'd suggest you instead point out that litecoin has already implemented segwit and lightning networks (if that's what you're objecting to).

It's not particularly biased commentary!
Now it doesn't address how side chain transactions require trust that is not part of the "pure Bitcoin experience" but I'm quite happy with trusting a large institution (bank or exchange) with small transactions in exchange for speed and efficiency.
At the same time, I do expect Bitcoin to maintain low fees, probably through an increased block size. Segwit bought us some time, but I'd have to see Bitcoin become utterly useless as a means of exchange.
I honestly don't see core devs claiming they want Bitcoin to become ONLY a settlement layer with high fees, so I don't see that happening, but even if it does, I'll be happy with a separate coin being used as secure, trustless cash.
But that's just me, this seems like a reasonable response to some blatant lies (or myths) that have come along with the more reasonable criticisms of blockstream.

There's the Reddit I've come to know and love!
Never change.

It'd be worth a lot to an attacker!
Say you start mining 60% of the hash rate and simply ignore any block that includes bittrex transactions (or any of a number of strategies to slow down a target's transactions). You can both refuse to include them in 60% of the chains blocks and orphan the blocks of any miner unless they pay you protection money.
You can also get away with double spending by extending the double spend through 6 blocks.
The problem isn't the possibility of forking, it's the possibility of attacking the main chain.
The concern here is that if BCC is being mined with a hash rate far greater than expected, while BTC is continuing with the pre fork hash rate, where did the new hardware come from? If someone is willing to stockpile millions of dollars of hardware without using it to mine, who's to say they won't just wait until they manufacture more than half the hashing power and then attack the main Bitcoin chain?

Oh for fuck's sake, they increased the block size without implementing some soft fork changes. You can accurately call it a stagnant copy (supporters would probably prefer "conservative") but if it's shitty, so was Bitcoin a day ago!

They funded it originally, and I believe they are still a major funding source. They didn't develop it directly, but I imagine they had some input.
