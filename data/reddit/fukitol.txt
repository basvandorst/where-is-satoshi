Dogecoin is an entirely separate currency, similar to but different from bitcoin. There are also Litecoin, Peercoin, Namecoin, and about 200 others.

Unfortunately you're fucked, at this point. I think Gox is going to be hit hard with securities fraud, and Kapeler is going the way of Bernie Madoff. Sadly that leaves you in the same position as Madoff's clients. I don't know what to tell you, other than next time don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your exchanges, and never hold on an exchange more than you intend to trade at that moment.
Regulation works, kinda. It works because the same people regulating the exchange (the SEC, ie the federal gov't) are the same people guaranteeing the assets (the FDIC, ie the federal gov't). That being said, without one you cannot have the other. There's no regulation without an insurer, and no insurer without regulation. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost of privacy. That's the exchange of freedom for security (or vice versa) that you get with crypto. 
I feel bad for you, but you got bit.
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:00:58
Short answer: Your address, that "wallet id", is what you're supposed to share, that's correct. There is no danger in anyone knowing that part, and them knowing it is the only way for them to send you money.
Long answer:
So a brief understand of public key cryptography is useful here. Basically, the way it works, is you have a *public key* and a *private key*. Anything that someone encrypts using your *public key* can only be decrypted using your *private key*. You never ever share your *private key*. In the world of cryptocurrency, that address (ie: "wallet id") is your *public key*. Inside your wallet, I use [MultiBit]( but there are many others, is stored your *private key*. This *private key* is what enables you to add transactions to the blockchain to send funds.

Seriously. Such a list doesn't likely exist, this was the developer's way of saying that this was a "problem" that should never be a problem.

Thank you for responding.
I checked my spam filter and didn't see anything from Coinabul.

One other concern I have that you'll probably want to address quickly is your password security. Your "welcome" email that was sent when I registered contained my password in plain text. Even if this is stored in an encrypted database, you run the chance of that database being compromised and you exposing your user's passwords. Instead, you should use a salted string that is then hashed multiple times using something like [SHA1](

Fiat has multiple meanings. "Currency" is an intrinsic value, as a good object for currency has 3 attributes:
1) Shelf-stability
2) Rarity
3) Not so rare as to be inaccessible
Take, for instance, corn. Corn has intrinsic value (food, feed, ethanol, whiskey, etc), but is not shelf-stable, and is therefore bad currency.
Gold has intrinsic value, but it's electrical and thermal conductivity are worse than many other materials and dwarfed by orders of magnitude by graphene. It is shelf-stable (non-reactive), is rare enough to be desired, but is not so rare as to be inaccessible. It is a perfect physical currency, and that is therefore it's highest-value intrinsic use.
Now let's look at USD. USD is shelf-stable, for sure. However, being created from thin air, it is not rare at all. It fails the second criteria for good currency.
Now look at Bitcoin. It's shelf-stable, it's kinda rare (requires mining), but is not so rare as to be inaccesible. Sure, there are only 21 million possible "coins", but those coins can be sub-divided into 100,000,000 pieces each. Bitcoin is a perfect currency, whose intrinsic values comes from its value as an abstraction of value (ie: a currency).

That's why I'm not heavily invested. This is something Bitcoin, and the community, should be able to handle. I think prices will drop for a while, we all can snag some cheap coin, and in 2 weeks everyone will forget this has happened.

Well I've never bought on mtgox, but if there's a "buy X btc" option you can't just type .001 in it? You can on CoinBase.

The original bitcoin code wasn't all that great. It was a novel concept, but implemented by someone who was certainly not a programmer. Gavin and his team have made great strides into making bitcoin production ready.

Definitely not a last attempt. It's the nature of an unregulated market to be manipulated.

Here's the thing: currency is subject to supply and demand just as much as anything else. Sure, there will be hoarding, but then the hoarding will stop as the value (price) stabilizes. Then, when there is again supply, the hoarding will start again. Rinse/repeat. That's how markets work.

What happens when the blockchain size becomes unmanageable? With HFT in the mix this isn't a ridiculous concept.

I'm not sure he's kidding. With 21M bitcoins available in total and trilllions and trillions of fiat, the currency has to deflate. With that much demand and a standard of using mBTC to denote cost already, $1000 isn't that insane.

It's not that hard, really, I'm not sure where you got that idea. You install an app and that's your wallet, and you wave your phone at people to pay them. And it's going to get easier with adoption. That's not really the point though. That doesn't make it fiat. USD is fiat because it fails the test of a useful currency.
And you want to see difficult to pay with? Try paying for your next load of groceries with corn. You'd need way more than a few pounds, fyi, better buy a truck.

The Euro is an established economy, while the Bitcoin economy is emerging. If everyone justs "invests" in them (ie: hoards them or flips them) then there is no commerce to establish a solid foundation.

Technicalities. The Fed injects the money printed by the Treasury in the form of bonds which they pull out of their ass, and they package it into "Quantitative Easing". It's the same end result.
There has never been a private central bank that did not end in massive inflation, and there's a reason for that. In the words of Amschel Rothschild: "Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes its laws"

Bitcoin is completely unregulated. I allow a bank to keep my fiat because I have recourse if it magically disappears. This is not true of bitcoin.

Before bitcoin can be taken seriously people need to stop saying "invest". You buy bitcoin, you spend bitcoin, you earn bitcoin. It's currency, not a commodity.

I don't understand how it's possible that coins can be "stolen" or even that there can be "coins". Aren't you, effectively, allocating space on the blockchain on a per-address basis? There is, after all, no concept of an individual coin, just an address that is allocated one coins' worth of space on the chain.
