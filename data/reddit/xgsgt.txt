how does segwit causes centralization? plz explain
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:57:22
we are still seeing segwit around 12% how did we reach 2.1MB?
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:49:31
it worked for me
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:21:09
are those the s9? how much the cost and how hard/easy is to set them up?
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:07:29
So stupid lol
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:43:28
he is not even using segwit wtf
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:56:23
Yeah but you can't use your btc to run from one exchange to another anymore like it used too, that's why litecoin got a lot of traction, withdrawals and deposits from one way to another started to be way faster
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:51:46
will die in August
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:13:25
We are late on this, bcash is already a Religion 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:02:45
I don't think this is how the protocol and the mining works. You do not set a time for block propagation. All the miners are contesting to mine the next block and once they get it it will be propagate it, if the block took 2mins or 12mins due to hash power it will be send, on every difficulty adjustment the block average is measured and if it's below 10min the difficulty increases, you can lower it to 9mins yes but we already have blocks mined at 9mins, so what you end up is to accelerate by even more the block mining and leave less time for other nodes to replicate. For those to make sense it will need a reduction to be more of 1min but again need another upgrade in the protocol and concensus which is really hard otherwise you end up with another fork 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:26:55
Hi, the fees right now are really low and confirmation times are improving, instead of closing it entirely you might consider enabling it and disable it depending on the network fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:50:26
need friendly ways to run LN thats all, once that starts hitting.... and few companies that offer merchant products for setting up LN this is a game changer
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:14:49
What do you mean by for free? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:17:53
ohh ok yeah I knew about the testnet network didnt know mainnet was called the actual network, thanks! 
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:05:02
last year there was 20times less ppl and the value of bitcoin was 1k.
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:14:39
He uses politics and marketing because he has no idea on the technical level 
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:37:05
In this case there is no problem, this type of centralization is not the problem, if the node is down new nodes and payments will emerge. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:18:08
So you only want post that are positive and are the ones you like? this doesnt look healthy 
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:01:03
This is great but I believe that the current market is really pushing trading and im not sure the Lightning Network will actually be adopted by the exchanges, so yeah we will probably get business but not exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:09:09
Bc exchanges and wallets are not using segwit not batching 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:10:53
can someone explain me what is "mainnet" lighning payments? is this like a dev environment or pre-prod environemt? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:48:44
I have been using segwit and i do feel its cheaper but I have felt also that they are being confirmed in the first blocks, is there is like a priority for including segwit transactions in the blocks to make this happen?
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:31:15
they are not spaming, they are USING the protocol, they are not being efficient but they are not sending spam, they are USING it, stop whinning like a little snowflake, if the entire protocol collapses just because one company is doing something ineficient then the bitcoin protocol does not have a future, there will be always companies and groups such has Coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:55:59
ppl talking just about storage knows nothing about the protocol and what nodes do, the problem is not storage is bandwith, upload bandwith from full nodes, that means ppl that actaually wants to help the network by running full nodes to validate everything that the miners are doing
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:13:13
great explanation, also wanted to add something else, ppl are forgetting that this are multisig channels with smart contracts implemented via nlocktimes, for one party to cheat and try to broadcast the new transaction and try to steal the funds the other party has time like 1 day? to punish the other person and get ALL of their other parties funds. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:52:25
Of course but imagine now it's only Coinbase and others not adopting better practices, imagine when more and more companies start doing the same if bitcoin depends on everyone doing there best this might not work and drive ppl to other technologies maybe even ones where they are a bit more centralized 
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:37:45
Why April 20th? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:11:54
where does it says its a getting rich scheme? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:00:32
Correct I think the same way we setup fees and default settings the nlocktime would probably also turn into a standard 
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:39:44
this is exactly right, what if 1% just put all the crap in _______ there must be a reason and a desire for them to do that, not just if the number because we have few, well guess what there is limit supply in a bunch of things as well.

If this is the reason why it is not done then are all alt coins secure by default because it takes too much to attack them? 
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:45:36
They are just trying to steal the name, trying to rebrand themselves like bitcoin, stole the Twitter also and today they announce a pull and commit to their ABC bcash client when it was not true 
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:52:54
Well it looks like it did not happen and were back to 13k
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:16:08
The problem is the unconfirmed transaction venir this one
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:33:42
It's better to move it to a segwit address for such low amount 
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:41:46
i think everyone knows that any exchange have the risk of being down, thats why NO ONE recommends to have your funds in the exchange
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:13:16
Go for it! 
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:46:21
Plz quote where it says it, because I couldn't find it
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:40:28
buts thats not, because once you start selling a bunch and you dont have the enough ppl to actually buy it then the price starts dropping, same it goes like this is not the same amount of money that has been put into XXX coin neither.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:54:37
0.01 or 1btc is not spam because it always depends on the size not the value of the transaction, in blockchain value the value of transfering 1BTC and 1000BTC is the same, thats the reason the fee is not by value, but by the size, the amount of inputs and data that you need to transfer and validate by each transaction, so if you are going to transfer 1BTC that takes 1million inputs, you will pay more fee and posible more than 0.01, so saying that satoshin considered below 0.01 btc fee as spam is wrong, because it always will take in consideration the amount of inputs and data you are transfering. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:27:11
Proof? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:44:13
These hackers are not even using segwit wtf
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:29:56
The problem with having runs in Bitcoin right now is the high fees and the mempool, its easier to have bull runs when ppl with lot of money and small amounts can both use the network, unfortunately right now the small amounts cant and this will make the run bull hard
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:22:21
Great infographic but what about the issue that the wallet or channel need us to be online to monitor it? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:40:44
Actually on today's programing and the right automation and deployment the goal is to deploy in production everyday or everyday hour, this is done also in huge systems, the implementation and path to production should be as fast as possible, of course if your development team is not thinking about this and you are still doing things old fashion way, then yeah your deployments are going to suffer. Have you ever heard of Netflix, Google, Amazon, Facebook being down for deployment? Nope, and that's because their team does probably deployments to production almost every hour or less

how is the segwit adoption still in 12% but the witness data increasing to 20%?
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:09:47
Yes, I am in it for the technological features and also for the Lambo
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:06:52
It's not simple, specially in an open space without one entity managing the futures and backlog priorities. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:20:08
We are also forgetting that business also do a LOT of transactions thru banks, big blocks are a really bad solution for the amount of tx/s we need 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:33:26
if we expect every single big group to behave perfectly we are doomed, yes they are not being efficient and we can point it but the end of the day they decide to keep wasting money on fees and they can run a business with this model and the protocol collapses then bitcoin does not have a future at all
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:55:06
Can you imagine what would those datacenters look without VMs? Or dockers containers? Well yeah that's how those datacenters would be if there weren't real scalable solutions such VMs, containers, not sure if you are too young but the size of the datacenters is not the problem it was the solution that was available 20 years ago 
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:15:03

@_date: 2018-01-18 19:11:37
Yeah, just copy paste his words into a quote and see which part do you think he is referring on the getting rich scheme, instead of pointing out and entire thread, just put his phrase 
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:48:38
Lol the quote is not about the fork or other crypto, what you can't copy is a bitcoin or a value in bitcoin digitally, my 1btc is unique, you can't copy it, it's not talking about duplicating the blockchain technology it's talking about the asset, you copy a digital game you can't copy 1btc of you fork it its not a btc it's bcash or something similar 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:22:34
someone donated 37BTC today 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:34:15
thats correct the LN is done with onion routing which is encrypted:
 there directly from the github
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:36:42
They are not going to come back until they can actually have lower fees 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:36:58
I started to use greenbits but I hate that it needs to connect and validate the Pin to their servers, it annoys me to hell, right now I cant even get into my wallet.... Electrum feels or has a weird UI and I have read that it looks like its incompatible with some address of segwit? should I got for samurai? jesus i wish coinomi uses segwit
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:31:28
Ohh what a great plan, let's try to make this adoption thing, but let's be mad at ppl when they are talking about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:39:58
You mean how to create de paper wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:49:16
Segwit fixes a bug called transaction malleability, it also enables lightning network, atomic swaps and some other cool things that will come in the future, increasing the block size is just that increasing the size of the block
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:23:01
if you do it in something like bitstamp that is already in segwit its actually fast and the fee is not that much, i just got $200 today in the afternoon
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:59:19
you are talking about "some" of them that were able to cash out and made money, a whole lot of ppl that worked in the banks and in in the financial institutions lost their job, the ppl that made money from the crash is like the 2% of the ppl that was working there
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:57:27
hey im just giving you options, but if you dont want to use them and just keep crying, then you should move to a better coin bc it looks like we are doomed :) 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:37:06
2 Question about LN, what happens when I want to send let's say 2btc but my current channel only has 1btc available, would transfering to channel of 1btc would it be automatically or implemented by wallets? And second what happens if I want to transfer 1btc to Mark but all the channels that routes to Mark does not have 1btc available? Will all the routes and channels need to have enough BTC for everyone? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:21:35
not every home can handle that today to be honest, you need to remember that not all home works with symetric connections, a home having 100mb of speed could have 2mb of upload or some, there is always a trade off. I do agree we need to increase the blocksize but we cant assume its just a problem of storage and capacity. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:41:16
Really easy insider trading gives someone advantage to take a first move in the market, if I know that tomorrow this xx shares are going to worth shit and I can sell them today for 200x then I will make a profit, and I got this information because I km the ceo or friend of a ceo that gives me privilege information 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:44:53
So what happens with the coin on the chain? We are not worry that both balances are no going to settle or be the same? Probably I'm not understanding everything 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:29:39
if you dont need the money, just hold it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:38:37
I wonder what happens if bcash goes skyrocking and btc prices collapses :O 
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:00:07
a single node can validate that the blocks in the blockchain are valid as well, ppl forget that you dont have only miners, you only have full nodes which only helps keeps the network secure.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:27:36
well its not dropping that much and if price goes up, the transactions will go up again and we are back at 300k shit show
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:20:30
instead of secret santa, ppl bring gifts to the office and ppl start opening them in some random order and then ppl start stealing some of the gifs, the interaction and the activity is quite funny, there are usually good presents and some shitty ones

@_date: 2017-12-22 04:33:59
if its from a segwit address is easier than a non segwit address, cool 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:24:32
how is that thing real, it says 84,413 unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions. but then you go to blockchain.info and its showing 174k
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:03:55
get a paper wallet from  and create 1 paper wallet after moving the mouse randomly for like 20mins, then once its created print it out and send the BTC to the address that you see in the paper. thats pretty much it
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:24:34
I love this information and this updates on the LN, i really do the only concern is how much time will it require for the infrastructure to take in place? 1 year? would we be able to keep working for 12-16more months with our mempool and unconfirmed transactions filling up to 200k? I dont know i think we need something else in the meanwhile, if not other coins which are better for paying will still the thunder for P2P or business payments
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:06:15
are you using a segwit wallets? if not then plz start using them, and as everyone has said if you need your money to be moving around for trading, use an alt coin, right now bitcoin is not great for moving small amounts, and thats probably what is causing the price to dip, ppl are using other coins. Im not sure LN will solve this problem if all we need is to move money for trading. I have a transaction with 102 sat/byte stuck in the queue for 4 days i think, not a good feeling but its what its, right now we can only wait for segwit to be more adopted and LN to come for 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:03:28
I think everyone is aware of the problem with scaling, making 10000 post about it does not solve anything, there is already work that is going to work, sorry if in your mind everything needs to be done now now now now, development and technology does not work like that. nothing has changed, there are plenty of news in the front page
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:45:30
I did a bunch of transactions yesterday with 120sat/B and they all worked out fine but im glad you got it :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:53:22
I like Luke but his views are a bit extreme, it's better to use segwit now 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:17:50
It kind of got stuck with 175k now
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:41:18
we will always see what happens once it starts scaling, second layers can also be congested
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:46:28
It's understandable that a increase in block size is not the best and final solution, but we are no doubting LN or segwit, we can have increase in blocksize as well as LN and segwit, my question is what happens with the other coin if we increase size 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:36:26
That's not how it works 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:04:19
So when we open the channel initially my?0.1btc gets locked, how does it get locked? Does the transaction is sent to B but it stays unconfirmed or there is no transaction at all to b and it is just like a transaction to myself with a new "state" of the coin? Maybe I need to understand how does open and closing a channel works in the blockchain, or how does it look on the ledger. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:03:12
I have one transaction stuck 4 days, 107sat/byte, there are 200k unconfirmed transactions, no matter what you say the data is against your post. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:18:51
I don't know much about multi sig wallets and the cosign, how does "they" co sign and how does that changes if I stop using greenbits? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:03:00
Bitstamp have segwit, I recommend using them, some wallets and exhai have mention they will do it on January, let's see 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:24:20
Can i open a channel and keep adding btc as time goes by? or one channel equals an specific amount? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:29:30
So you want adoption without ppl talking about it? Sounds like a great plan. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:40:40
Imagine if everyone in the space would help others, we wouldn't even half way right now, there is a difference between help and doing the work for them, they need to learn by themselves but they need to start somewhere, this threads about not helping are getting on my nerves 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:18:46
hahaha haha 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:02:06
2004? there was no bitcoin in 2004 XD
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:05:52
Below 15k now embrace for impact! 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:19:34
thats really cool I have a wedding to attent tomorrow but im not sure if I should do it or not, they probably need the money to use it right now and not to save it
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:09:08
the problem is that we are always looking this vs a Fiat currency.... i dont think this was intended 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:37
lol if you noticed my post, im all +LN and BTC, it looks like in your mind whatever someone has a comment with any question looks like is spreading FUD, you know it can happen right? the majority of ppl probably doesnt even know what bcash or btrash is they just care about being able to transfer money right now and bcash allow it. "you idiots" statement make you sound more retarted. but hey thanks for your empty post
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:38:26
well said
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:34:54
Start with the YouTube channel of andreas antonopoulos
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:31:30


Thats really good info but what I understand is that we have 2 different scenarios, my small daily payments and our address that contains our savings, so opening a LN chanel is similar to put money in and account for small and daily transactions, yes if you do not have it and setting it up the first time might be a pain, but once you have it open you can keep using the channel. I know ppl probably want to use their BTC wallet directly to business but Im not sure thats the most effective way at least not with Bitcoin and how so much ppl are using it for store of value
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:13:00
I agree we need to increase the blocksize in short term, as long as we don't do it in 2 months again, now the problem is also the consensus if core or someone increases the blocksize by hardfork we might end up with another split
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:19:20
But dude my my Satoshis vision! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:31:26
And it's increasing now again =(
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:04:30
But the problem is not "reading" the blockchain, i totally understand that for the blockchain i need to read a node, but im talking about inputting my pin for login in the wallet, that pin needs to connect to the greenbit/greenaddress servers :/ 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:45:36
Forking is not easy, to get consensus, forget about it, you will just end up with another coin, which bcash had already done, forking. Not everyone needs to swap for segwit but in the meanwhile if you are going to transfer having some in segwit address will help you out
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:14:20
I actually live that, I had to carry those slips month after month to my bank for the counter to process them, yeah we actually did not had the money until we go to the bank and gave them those slips, and also the CC was done via phone call, in which we had to get an authorization number and write it on the chage slip for the customer to sign it, all this process would take around 5-10mins, calling, getting the amount, getting the authorization code, getting the card, signing, etc. it was a pain in the ass, that was more than 10 years ago. It took more than 20-30years for banking to get the CC as we know it, but some kids believe that scaling can happen with 2 lines of code.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:40:22
it also means that another person is learning and using bitcoin to transfer value :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:59:40
Great give away! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:50:57
I got some but their wallet is shit and almost no other waller support it, I really hate to have a coin with such terrible wallet support 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:43:11
can we get some information of the roadmap for core team on the increasing of the block size? would it be after LN is finished?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:20:07
great info! thanks, downloading greenbits now
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:07:21
How many files does you have? And what is the UI for requesting the password on your parents thumbdrive? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:31:41
no, they do not and the difficulties also change differently from coin to coin
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:13:45
Greenbits and Greenaddress request me to "login" does that creates something in their servers or does the wallet sends something to some server? data, keys, etc?
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:13:09
you can not have all the information in the market, specially on IT and Technology.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:37:43
but but Satoshi's Vision??? /s
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:32:24
software the LN will find you the best route and and the hub either have the channel open with your or not, in that case you just find another hub or channel. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:50:05
I have requested some of the wallets that I was using to adopt segwit and I have moved to segwit myself with greenbits, some exchanges has mention that they will start working on January on it and hopefully others wallets will follow, the problem will  be probably that the big majority of address are still none segwit for a long time. LN will take time also to be adopted. There is no short term fix for our current problem I fear like escalabity will come late. Technology is not everything and sometimes solutions needs to compromise, increasing the blocksize might not be a bad idea if there the problem does not get fixed in 1-2 quaters of 2018. lets see if ppl can or not actually keep on this bs of waiting weeks for transactions or paying premiums on fees.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:54:55
Easy, do you believe in the tech? if yes buy, if no then dont buy. speculating over price and listening to random internet ppl on reddit full of memes is the worse. Read about the tech, the news etc. Get real data and not memes, and remember DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE TECH AND THE PROBLEM THAT BITCOIN IS RESOLVING? simple question, simple answer

has anyone calculated how much money in fees and in time will cost to open this simulation in the blockchain? having LN is great and all but I feel like the fees to open up the channels might be an issue, and the time it will take for the blockchain to process all this.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:11:08
as i understand and i was explained today, you can verify your transfer to the multisig address which is when you open up the channel, your transactions after that cant be traced on the blockchain bc they do not exist in the blockchain until the channel closes and it settles all the balances.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:18:07

If you are so sure it's going to crash why are you asking? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:01:04
1mb is not enough and that's why using segwit will improve the amount of transactions per block increasing it like 40%, gets you less fees, and just yesterday someone post with proff that if we all use segwit the mempool would be almost empty, sadly the implementation of segwit by exchanges and wallets have been slow. Have you moved to segwit wallet/address yet?
I think increasing the size is in the road, but the problem is that if the increase happens now with a hardfork then as you can see exchanges and wallets even users are freak lazy and won't implement segwit and will just keep increasing the size, this can't work I have seen this type of solution in IT all the time, this works only in the short term, i think we do need to increase in the short term bigger blocks, but I also understand the necessity to make ppl use segwit 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:58:34
great, thanks for the info! i read it and the thing was posted 2 years ago but it gives me a few doubts " I propose we work immediately towards the segwit 4MB block
soft-fork which increases capacity and scalability" do they think that by implementing segwit that is automatically the 4MB block increase? or are they going to also do 2/4/8 increase? 
And lastly for roadmap i was thinking something in the future for 2018/2019 not from such old post thou :/
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:22:20
I know what you mean and I support 200% LN, and im actually excited to use it, but you have to agree that having a mem pool full and 150k unconfirmed transaction is not a great user experience, at the end of the day that will matter for the normal user, they will pick and choose a currency that would help them pay and move around. We do need long term solutions such has LN but we also need a bit of short term
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:44:02
Dont do that, if you are going to transfer it back, do 50/50 keep 50% in Bcash and 50% in BTC. There is a lot of money in BCash and big groups are behind it, even thou I do not support ther way of resolving the scalable problem, they might increase in value over time.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:27:34
Im wonder what and how the regulations are going to start, this is actually quite interesting, first they will need to consider bitcoin a currency which is not right now, exchanges are regulated because they do work with FIAT money, there are exchanges that does not requires you anything and those do not use fiat, so this could be the case of the LN hubs, but eventually the goverment and tax will come either to LN or to the business using crypto, either way, much better solution than banking.
if starbucks wants to use a hub in rusia or japan instead of a heavy one on US that is regulated that would be fun to see. The good thing about this is that anyone can start having hubs you dont need to have much to have a hub, you have to remember that his are for micropayments, its not for moving 10bts, but I can clearly setup couple of channels with 0.10btcs and that would help small and micro transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:32:28

@_date: 2017-12-20 00:08:16
even with LN up and live, we still need to send our balance to a channel, that creates a multisig address and a transaction in the blockchain, that will also be a unconfirmed transations :/
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:42:52
4k :O wow that would be interesting that means that btc would probably drop to 15k? or more? if we take a look on the coinmarket there is a lot of BTC/BCH transfer from the exchanges.

This is a really good point and concern for the development teams, if they want real support from business to use Bitcoin as a medium of payment, they will definetely need to speed up the LN and all the infrastructure or compromise with the block size if not 2018 will lose all the momentum gained this year.

That I understand, so the premise is that we won't need to close the channels? But how does our two balances going to settle after a long period of transactions? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:11:19
Does everyone recycle? No, same with segwit ppl like you don't care, they rather keep using your old wallet and complaining that others are not doing the work for you, coinomi said that they will implement segwit and so other exchanges, you can support wallets that do, like greenbits or ledger, samurai, etc. Ppl don't use  segwit bc they are busy looking to the value of the coin, exchanges and wallets don't implement segwit bc it requires them implementation and development time, which it cost them also, they just want to keep earning without spending, look at Coinbase and there problem with small amounts of btc, or they had implemented segwit and batch transactions long ago they wouldn't have this problem. Short sighing in IT gives you tons of technical debt

What can we do, this is a good time to start using segwit wallets and start thinking to request your exchange/wallet to implement segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:30:24
Im using greenbits with segwit, its pretty easy to use
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:52:15
Yes, totally backwards compatible 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:23:40
in their faq it says the following
"When you create a PIN, a random 256 bit AES password is created and used to encrypt your mnemonics and store them on your device in encrypted form. This password is sent to the server and destroyed on the client."
and if you try to put the pin when your phone is offline, it wont work saying that it cant connect to the greenbit/greenaddress server, this worries me a little because if their servers are gone or offline I wont be able to log into my wallet? I would probably need to restore my wallet with my BIP32 phrase somewhere else to restore it I guess?
PS: I do have a ledger nano S, but I want to have a separate wallet on my phone with segwit for small amounts
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:28:10

i really hope they implement it! at least they are hearing their community and stuff
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:00:25
yeah lets do this now, in 2 months, when you have still 10% of segwit adoption we will be wondering why no one is adopting it, then we will want bigger blocks again bc no one has segwit, then 2 months more we are and we are full again and guess what, we are full of transactions and there is no segwit adoption yet, maybe by that time LN is getting adoptet but guess what no exchange or wallet would adopt LN or Segwit because for them it COST MONEY, block size increase cost money for the developers, but since they are getting upgrades for free and at no cost to the wallet/exchanges bc they dont care about the customer then they get a free pass. 
I say lets hold on a few more months, it looks like exchanges are going to implement segwit in january and some wallets as well, after that we can see if we really need to do increase the blocksize.
Besides have you think about what happens if there is a blocksize by hardfork? there is a high chance to be another split or another fork of the bitcoin, right now if you want less fees i think its better to go to another coin, named bcash or litecoin, etc. I would rather wait.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:04:41
and then when you have 10 inputs and you try to transfer or use those 100, the fees will be much worse
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:53:49
Bitcoin was not priced at $17k, a Satoshi now cost way more than a Satoshi before and also more ppl using and transferring btc. What will happen when bitcoin is worth $100k, probably fees will also cost more in Fiat, I do agree we probably need a block increase but this will probably happen we start seeing LN released and adopted 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:03:50
To be honest I rather get the mempool and unconfirmed transactions issue resolved rather than the price hitting 20k
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:56:22
This is kind of stupid, if you can't buy a cup of coffee with BTC how are you going to be financial free? Being free does not mean becoming rich or selling your btc for Fiat and paying your debts, which is great if you can, being free is having a way to go out of the Fiat system, and in order to allow ppl to exit you need to have a system which allows you to buy coffee. That's why 2nd layer solution such LN or atomic swap are so necessary. Your post makes little sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:21:56
no one has said there is no problem, but you can have a workaround or you can keep crying like a baby, solutions are going to come several exchanges have mention they are going to support segwit, core wallet is going to have the UI for segwit, other wallets have mention that they are going to support segwit, but if all you can do is to complain and cry and do nothing about it, then keep doing it, it will help you do wonders!

wallets can help by having you know.... something like segwit so it goes cheaper and makes the adoption faster, it can also check and get the fees estimation better, most of the wallets are over estimating fees, might not be all the problem but they are part of the problem.

i dont think they are panicking for no reason, i think most of the ppl are tired of having transactions stuck and not confirmed, probably a lot of ppl are just going to alt coins, its a valid reason, the network is full and ppl are paying too much in fees to get them confirmed. Im not selling my btc but ppl that are doing trading need other solutions to be moving money around and BTC is not good for that right now.

I always do dollar cost average, but if you have 10k laying there doing nothing, then just go in now and forget about it, you never know if it will go up or down and retrace back again to 7k or 8k, in that case if you are not sure, then just buy 50/50, do 5k right now, wait a bit and then do another 5k or 50/50 again and so on the easiest is to buy without looking behind, i have bought at 18k, at 2k, at 3k, at 5k, etc and im still up by a lot and i believe that for next halving w/e i buy now it will be probably up as well

why the wallets are not adopting this feature? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:15:03

@_date: 2017-11-04 23:33:04
There is always a question on my mind, there are other coins out there with even better features than bitcoin or the same why is only bitcoin so valuable? Aren't we afraid that technology will make blockchain/bitcoin outdated? Then what? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:35:17
I agree with you but it looks like the adoption of bitcoin is also bringing a lot of ppl that thinks that bitcoin is good for storing value and they compare it with gold, what would make the community lose this mindset? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:02:19
so you are saying that actually saying that the miners that stays in the BTC network gets rewarded a lot due to the fees but not due to the price of the block right? miners do not get affected much due to the decrease of the hashing power in the network but us as users do because we need more hashing power to get transactions confirmed?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:18:12
I bet they have thought about it, my question is why not implement it as we get segwit and LN into production

How did they scam you? They have the private keys in your device and you can recover your transactions with your seed into another wallet

It's an ecosystem of both merchant and consumers, it's not driven just from consumers, we all have bitcoin, where can we use it? Yeah we need more stores

my "why" question was more about how does he know that litecoin is going to skyrocket like bitcoin? how is him so sure? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:50:56
just did, there is no link related to my original question
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:01:44

Who is Pantera and why do we care?

You guys are real something, you know the 99% of the population does not know what bitcoin really is right? Calling her wife or the op stupid is totally uncalled for, is that even helping the community?
No, bitcoin does not have a physical coin, just tell her bitcoin is a digital currenc and if she does not believe you, show her the links from Amazon and aliexpress, bitcoin is a digital asset. Hopefully this is not the last time you interact with this community or the currency!

I would say your friend is full of shit, probably just a way to sound interesting and be the o"mg I made this how can I lost 100k" just to be the focus of the attention.

i understand your mean point, but your same logic applies in 1year once its officially out and a vulnerabilty is found or a major change is needed to be done into the network, what do you think? that the entire network is going to shutdown and upgrade? yeah i didnt think so. I also think that going to mainnet now is not good but you will have this same issues once you release the gold version, this is software you will always do changes.

Can someone explain me this? Are they just simulating the fork before time? And then once it happens they will actually give that amount to everyone? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:45:11
Blockchain is way way slower than what visa and mastercard uses why do you think they will use blockchain? Just for the sake of it? And you are forgetting that business have chargebacks, money is not payed until later and the process fee. It looks like Bitcoin does have some pros. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:14:36
There are like 2 sites that they payout in BTC, look for them
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:37:35
Exodus.io does not support bcash neither :(
Jaxx has said that they would take 2 weeks like 4weeks ago :/
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:48:38
Thanks! great answer :D 
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:13:27
I just enter to bitcoin a few months ago and I'd you live outside of US or UK, it's not easy, it's actually hard and expensive, specially if you want to use credit cards, besides there is also the information you need to read and learn. Do you really think that knowing how to use a wallet, backup etc is easy? It's not user friendly. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:08:11
Go for a ledger they have segwit as well 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:07:46
To sell.....
In all seriousness I haven't sold my original BCH and bought more when it was $510, I'm holding them but I'm not sure how much endure 
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:31:36
�� �� �� I'm sorry for the op but this post is funny. Use the service posted before they are legit 
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:26:29
No, not yet my USD is in cex.io so I can buy only btc, ether, bitcoin cash and dash. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:11:31
It's hard to consume when adoption is still far away. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:33:14
You know that you can and you should as part of a user of bitcoin take your coins out of the exchange such as Coinbase. If you don't support what Coinbase is doing, take your money somewhere else and put your money where your mouth is, don't rely on the government to protect you when you can yourself by just move to another exchange. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:36:48
unfortunately Exodus does not have wallet for Bitcoin Cash :(

What does being ETF approved means?

When I retired from playing Dota 2, my inventory worth around 3k in USD, lost 1k with the lootmarket fiasco and sold the rest for bitcoin, that was in June, that was the best desicion I have ever made to get into bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-24 23:06:49
I really hope this does not even happens 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:19:54
They did have mention it one time, they even bought bitcoin rigs for their server in the other room, there was a mention by Gilfoyle to be payed in cash or bitcoins. You are welcome =) 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:55:48
How often are you buying? And how do you choose when to buy more? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:58:58
I know that for security it's better to accept the funds into different addresses, but later on if you want to move a lot of btc to one address for a payment or exchange doesn't having small transactions will take longer or be more expensive to move? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:42:22
This story is crazy but I still believe you need to thank zero404cool, yes he was going to charge more but if it wasn't for him you would probably never knew about the exploit, a thanks or at least a tip would be nice to send him for recovering 30k and your piece of mind 
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:57:54
Go for it dude, don't and investment and trying something either saving, investing etc is always good, my recommendation is, don't wait for it to dip it might never do, if you are hesitant on doing it do 50/50 buy 150 now and buy 150 later if it dips you have 150 to buy and if it rises you already got 150 for a good price!

Do I need to have a lightning node running in order to use it? 
@_date: 2018-04-07 05:41:51
so if ACINQ node does not do any relay or works has a medium of payment to open a channel, where should I open up a channel if I want to pay for lets say coincards.ca, should i open a channel with blockstream? or the only thing right now is to open a channel with the vendor?
@_date: 2017-07-07 01:40:44
thanks! will try it out
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:26:03
hey dude i saw that cexio has a long time in the industry and they are in the UK and that gave me some trust, but looking at those reviews it looks like they shouldnt be trusted, thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-07 01:40:51
cool thanks! 
@_date: 2017-07-06 02:54:31
Well that's the thing, I haven't found a Central America exchange that is solid and legit, I looking to cash out some of my BTC and ETH to my bank account. But my bank is in Costa Rica. 
@_date: 2019-05-07 07:07:24
Dude you just did one of the best arguments about bitcoin, segwit and just increase the blocksize, bravo. its hard to find post like this and its weird that we developers, techleads, architects needs to argue with ppl about scaling, imagine what would happen to cloud or datacenters if we were just adding hardware to boxes and not creating VM, docker, k8 and scaleup and scaleout solutions.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:00:32
Coinbase implement segwit last year and more than a year ago
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:45:02
This can never go into mainstream as well and it would worth less of nothing
@_date: 2019-05-06 06:54:42
i love how this memes just comes and they dont last 1 day xD
@_date: 2019-05-03 06:35:35
Thanks for your contribution!
@_date: 2019-05-16 06:34:20
I know i use them a lot, that's why we need more adoption and implementation
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:04:39
We probably need to do more information on why you shouldn't be using blockchain wallet vs segwit enable ones so they stop being 20% of the transactions
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:02:49
I don't care about bcash, what i do care is that if the protocol allows a better utilization of the blocks we do it, having 50% on average is not great, hopefully this can grow more if blockchain.com and their wallet with makes 20% of the transactions starts implementing segwit
