I've given up. I'm working on other income sources now.  
These are the 9 valid mnemonics I found, if it helps anyone.  
  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  
Filters I used:  
* Only fully white-coloured BIP39 words.  
* Only words in proximity pairs. For example, "zero run" is very close to each other.  
* All mnemonics end with "provide way" because it's the closest to "X marks the spot"  
* First two mnemonics begin with "trust paper" because it's the closest to "infinity".  
I'm not asking for anything. I'll be glad this post helps someone to solve it. Good luck.

Thing is, OP never acknowledged that the rest are clues except for the ones he explicitly mentioned which are *think in pairs*, *half of them are irrelevant* and *almost open*.

Say you found a valid mnemonic, since it can generate many keys, is there a software to run through all the keys and show the available BTC balance in them?
@_date: 2018-05-20 06:28:36
What do you think that is?

As some have mentioned before, the answer shouldn't lie in a digital footprint because the artwork is also being sold on a print. The puzzle can be solved even with the printed version.

I have found exactly 9 valid mnemonics that are NOT using the words OP had given as clues. Thing is, I have no idea where to look in the infinite list of keys.

Good to know. Thanks!

We’re on the same boat, except I learned about BIP39
@_date: 2018-05-25 11:59:02
I did not brute force to get the mnemonics I have. It’s based on a pretty obvious visual clue based on OP’s clues. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 11:33:24
No, no one said that. Why? 
@_date: 2018-05-22 01:09:57
Is there a specific reason why it's BIP49 and not others?
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:18:59
I doubt it since this method won't work with the printed version. The solution has to be in plain sight as stated, which can still be solved when you have the printed poster hanging on your wall.

24 mnemonic is an assumption. It could be 12, 15, 18 or 21 too.

Thanks man! How do I use this on Mac? I have Electrum but when I run the module it says


@_date: 2018-05-22 01:14:10
Just type your answers in the 'BIP39 Mnemonic' box, the first box. It will tell you right away whether it's a valid or invalid seed. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:07:39
I have visually identified 9 valid mnemonics, but it seems that each mnemonic can generate infinite amount of keys? How is it possible to locate the exact key?   
  


  
This clue shows that instead of brute-forcing, there is a way to idenfity the exact key from a valid mnemonic. Need to find this clue.

Ok so it’s a collective entity or a collection of entities? Semantics, sigh.  
  
So what do you think about the rationality of most investors at the moment? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:18:09
So no “never invest more than what you can afford to lose”?
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:44:05
That’s what I thought. But why they say BCH is centralized and 92% is controlled by 2 miners?
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:13:49
Entity means ‘existence’ or ‘being’. Are you trying to say that Bitcoin doesn’t exist?? Whether it’s worthy or worthless is irrelevant to the fact that it exists.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:06:05
But so many merchants and businesses are using it. Why would people stop using it.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:09:39
Yes you have a point. Quantum computers can shut down cryptography easily.

So Bitcoin is unstoppable and who’s not holding it will regret when it reaches $1,000,000 per Bitcoin?

ikr... criminals get their dirty money by cash. they never get dirty money from credit cards or wire transfers because it has records. and Bitcoin?? LOL! it’s a record that everyone can see. no criminals would be stupid enough to use it.  
  
without cash (fiat), criminals can’t get dirty money anymore. this is why some of these financial criminals are against Bitcoin, because they are the same bunch of assholes who use dirty money and work with dirty people so they can continue to sit on top of the social pedestals.

but there are some addresses that have never sent out any BTC since 2011
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:13:07
Come back mid November. BTC will hit a new record high. But in between, it's a big dip. So if you don't want to watch while it happens, don't watch.
