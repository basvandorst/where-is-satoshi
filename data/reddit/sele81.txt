I did that  and it crashed after I bought. 2nd was  up to $1000 and we know what happened after the 2014 crash. But it paid out so far because I still hold.

@_date: 2017-12-14 01:17:06

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:31:23
Sometimes old "friends" pop out of nowhere ;)
Not yet but its possible.
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:21:57
I wonder if I can click on that link in the email? It seems legit, when I hover it it shows the url of bitcointalk.org
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:54:36
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:53:47
I can not post that image, why?
@_date: 2018-08-03 10:38:11
When i hover it shows the URL of bitcointalk.org that's why I think to Klick it. In the other Hand I dont know if they can implement a direct redirect to a scam site.
@_date: 2018-08-02 09:44:50
Yeah I tried that just now. It says this username/account does not exist. How can I contact them now? Its an aged account from 2012 and have Legendary status. Maybe somebody can see if some crap has been posted with mus username UnDerDoG81 
@_date: 2019-03-18 01:38:23
Then I got 100 Bitcoins...

Laziest people/country on first spots �� Btw I am lazy and turkish.
@_date: 2019-03-04 18:14:32
Unless you pay with family and friends and they dont care when your 600 bucks gets stolen so obviously.
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:59:20
Was the same with mtgox and bitstamp before mtgox shut down...
@_date: 2018-10-08 12:01:33
If it follows the same pattern like after the mtgox crash, we will see 2-3k. It was Stable at 666 for a long period as I remember. Then came denial and we ve seen 200s.
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:57:43
That's good. Before the 2017 pump we were hovering at 666.6... Next target 66666.6 ��
@_date: 2018-10-01 17:52:44
You sold them when? Dang bought 2014 and still hodling.
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:53:50
In 2014 I bought at 700 with all my savings. And after the ATH we crashed all the way down from 1200 to 200. Just hold. It will get better.

USA should bring democracy to China like they bring it to middle east ����
@_date: 2019-02-18 09:14:50
Sure but the day will come where they kill bitcoin I think. So I have at least 50% cashed out. To reinvest in other things. Not to keep it in fiat.
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:43:32
My plan is to hodl till end of 2020 and sell 50%  �� the rest can stay till 20xx
@_date: 2019-02-17 23:34:43
At 40k I'll sell 50%. I hodled for 6 years now and at some point you need to cash out a bit.
@_date: 2019-02-18 15:45:17
What gives? See you in 2021
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:04:24
Invite me too
@_date: 2019-02-18 15:36:14
Nope not cashed out since 2013. Was thinking about at 20k but yeah we are at 3.9 now ��
Edit: sorry, missunderstood your post. Of course I x10 my Cash since 2013 at the moment. And bank would give me not even 1% in that timespan. But 50x was feeling nicer in 2017/18

Uh somebody missed buying
@_date: 2019-04-30 16:12:53
Still hoping for $1k coins huh?
@_date: 2019-04-03 18:23:38
Thanks, none native english speaker here...
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:41:23
If it hits 50k a coin, ill cash out 60% and invest 50% in other stuff, wich I dont know yet. I missed to cash out anything at 20k and that was a lesson. At some point in your life you have to start to live.
If only I would have cashed out my bcash and bgold... Because I doubt bcash will ever see 4k again.
Edit: yeah I am going to live the full ego asshole life as much as I can... Because nobody in this world was ever good to me... Especially women... Fuck em and use em all :D
@_date: 2019-04-17 17:54:27
You got me it's mine
@_date: 2019-04-15 18:47:39
You know what? 3k actually is still huge, if that will be the bottom! Can you imagine, 2-3 years ago the bottom was around $200. Then it multiplied in factor x100. İf thats what is going to happen in the next wave too, see you mfs at 300k ��
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:52:36
I think he should enjoy the time with his dick...
@_date: 2019-04-02 09:21:36
Wake me up 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:11:49
Yeah at least some action...
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:39:16
Nope it's going down to get ready for the next bullrun... We have seen almost no interest in Bitcoin since 20k all the way down to 3.5k... Sub 3k might be an interesting entry point for most people.
@_date: 2018-11-29 09:49:30
Possibly yes
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:48:43
Maybe even down to $9... 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:33:44
Sure we are used to these old patterns since bitcoin exist. Dump... Dump... Dump... Pump... Dump more... I think 2.2-2.5k will be the bottom.
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:37:49
When the pattern repeats like in the last years, the next dump to 4k will come in a few days. They dump, wait how the market react, then dump more etc... I see the bottom at 2-3k ish. Unfortunately :/
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:22:20
Next dump wave started. Could be bloody months ahead. Only the strongest will hold.
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:09:16
Just today +$300
I remember those times where $10 jumps a day were exciting...
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:48:56
Before the last bullrun (or let's sey after the gox crash) bottom was $220. Now imagine where we go if $3.2k was the bottom this time.
Last time it gone up x100
If this time only x10 that's still insane.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:38:01
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:38:50
Expecting 60-70k for the next ATH
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:31:53
Long term Hodler here, no worries, won't sell until 50-70k
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:38:34
I remember buying some bitcoins  and the next day it dropped to about 100€ or so. I tried a lot to cancel the transaction. Because transactions on bitcoin.de took a few days. But luckily it got approved ����
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:04:19
Wow people hoping for 3k coins and call it cheap! What a great time! Just shows how huge the next ATH will be. I mean, just 3-4 years ago we were hovering around three digits and people were hoping for two digit bitcoins...
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:37:32
So we are heading between 50k and 100k by ~2020. I can live with that.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:37:28
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:30:40
Just like she does not even own one brain cell!!!
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:51:48
No worries we all gone through this everything is fine
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:05:31
I think normal people left bitcoin last year. When rich people come in we go crazy.
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:24:04
I heared people waiting for three digits ��
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:18:21
One of each color
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:36:04
You should have waited few more months and could buy the original.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:22:14
So for the next run it simply must become easier to buy bitcoin ;)
98% (guess) of the people do not know how or where to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:17:52
50k?? Cmon next is 200k I expect. In 2021...
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:23:48
When 99% forget about Bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:33:50
I am in disbelief. That rally aint real, too early.
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:45:40

And down we go
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:57:23
Actually they are doing us a favor. The lower it goes, the more new cash will flow in for the next ride. I see sub 2k in february. Maybe/hopefully next december ATH.
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:39:53
I am on the "to tha moon" train as well. But seriously, it's not the time yet...

Price must only x20
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:14:25
You lost nothing unless you sold your coins.
@_date: 2018-12-16 20:08:34
I asked me the same question after the gox crash where I got in.
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:14:35
Or big players aka media owners etc. entered the game and now bitcoin is fine ����
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:54:27
Depends wich sub forum. I am mostly in speculation in the Wall observer thread.
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:25:39
Got it ��

You know what, the United States established a well functioning system there with terrorists as reason for everything that goes wrong in the country and the world. Other countries adapting this model now. Turkey and Erdoğan is the best sample. Everybody who votes against Erdoğan is a terrorist.
