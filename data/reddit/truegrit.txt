well, it just has to.

This is a better approach than the idea that it’s all random, and unknowable when to buy. I think this should be stickied.

Yes, I'll believe the fork is dead when the block passes without a fork.

Long time follower of BTC... just read it... learned some stuff.

Call me paranoid, but I may have to see the block come and go to believe it with all the hype that surrounded this event. Not sure I would go as far to say the people behind the fork would try to pull a fast one, but this seemed out of left field. Maybe I’m just out of the loop...

Interesting. 30% seems like plenty to at least get it going... and all the money involved here... people don’t spend this kind of money and energy to not follow through on it.

The most likely thing that will "kill" Bitcoin will be something better that comes along.

You are at the most qualified age to take such a risk. A traditional investment allocation for your age would be heavy stocks (more risk) anyway. Acquire your Bitcoins with confidence young person.

I removed the unconfirmed transaction from my wallet, and didn't ever try to send it again to the same address. I've just been waiting now for the original transaction to get confirmed, although I'm starting to worry a bit.
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:17:13
Was your wallet fully synced with blockchain before you sent? My wasn't, and I thought that might have something to do with it... I'm using Core, but am considering switching soon. Not saying it's the wallets fault...
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:08:21
If you are using Bitcoin Core wallet, I ran bitcoin core executable with the --zapwallettxes flag and it cleared out the unconfirmed transaction. My balance shows the original amount, and now I'm debating whether to attempt to resend it to the same address, or create a new transaction through Steam with a new BitPay address. If you want to try it, just open Powershell and navigate to Program Files/Bitcoin 
    cd "C:/Program Files/Bitcoin"
and then run:
    ./bitcoin-qt.exe --zapwallettxes
If you want to rescan too (optional, might take a while):
    ./bitcoin-qt.exe --rescan --zapwallettxes

Well, at long last, it finally confirmed a little while ago. Guess that will be a lesson to me... in my defense, I've never had a transaction take so long. Apparently, though it was the low fee.
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:17:21
The block that it shows it to be in on blockchain.info has already been mined apparently... Not only that, but it doesn't even show the transaction when I search that block... I'm sort of stumped. This is the first time I've ever had anything like this happen.
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:49:08
On a related note, what about a transaction that is in the blockchain, but has been waiting on confirmation for about 12+ hours now... Been showing estimated confirmation time "Very Soon (High Priority)" for about 12 hrs...
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:57:49
So, this worked for clearing the unconfirmed transaction, but if I resend it to the same address with a higher fee, what will happen? Would it be better to send it to a different receiving address, or would it have to be the original? Just don't want to further screw the pooch, since right now I have my unconfirmed coins back...
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:00:22
Yep, same exact thing happened to me last night. Still waiting on mine to go through. ~$60 It's been saying "Estimated Confirmation Time: Very Soon (High Priority)" for nearly 12 hrs. I even got an email from Steam saying there was an error, and to resubmit payment. Hopefully when/if it's confirmed my game will show up in my library... otherwise, this was an expensive game I just played.
