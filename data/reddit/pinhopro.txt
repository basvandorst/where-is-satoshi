Hello everybody,
My name is Rodrigo Souza and I am one of the lead developers of the BlinkTrade project.
We got this press a little bit too early, and our website doesn't really explain how decentralized BlinkTrade is designed to be.
I will try to put together a video for the community explaining how it will work exactly. 
So far, I urge people to check our source code (  )  and scrutinize it as much as possible. Our goal is to have an exchange that is the highest possible quality and also open source, so that as many people as possible all around the world can use it to run high quality Bitcoin exchanges.
We have to get bitcoins into the hands of as many people as possible, especially in the developing world, before the regulators of the world starting banning bitcoins. This already happened in Ecuador and Bolivia. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 06:11:52
We strongly encourage our users to sell the bitcoins they buy at SurBitcoin on localbitcoins, so they are prepared for the worst. 
Government can't control bitcoin just as they can't control Bolivars. Governments just can't control money supply. 
The people there want Dollars or Gold. The only way to have access to Dollars in Venezuela is through contraband. I believe that if they can get access to Dollars through bitcoins, for example by working online, or through remittances, the demand for black market Dollars will decrease.
We need to teach Venezuelans how to use coinapult, bitreserve and other alternatives so that they can lock their bitcoins into Gold, USD, Euro.
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:49:21
Well .... there are more 2k Venezuelans registered at oDesk.

We have two registration options, one where you wait for a broker in your region, and once that broker appears, you go through that broker's verification process.
When we start an exchange in a new country we give our broker a standard form which he can adjust to the information he is required to collect.
The form that is here is that standard form and it's just an example which I ask people not to fill in. I will be adjusting the form soon and not asking for that information. 
When a broker appears in your region you will be informed and the broker might have to ask you even more information.
I just want to remind you that we are not a P2P exchange. We are a software company which is trying to create a solution where the bitcoins are not centralized in one place and where the liquidity is openly available to whoever wants to enter the market.
People who would like to open an anonymous exchange can download our source code and start their own exchange. They are welcome to do so.
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:54:46
yep :)
Very soon, we will be in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and another 9 countries. I can't yet mention which :)

It is very on the beginning, but growing exponentially.
SurBitcoin opened its door in Aug/2013.
From Aug/2013 to Sep/2013 we got around 600 registered users
In October alone another 1200 registered users
Today is Nov-20 and we already reached 3200 registered users
From all those users, about 100 are venezuelans living abroad who are selling small amount of bitcoins to send money to their family, but it is not enough.

I am asking people to act as market makers. You don't have to sell at bidding price, you can set your own price.  Our problem is lack of liquidity.  In case you sell any amount of Bitcoins, you can buy them back at lower price using the Bolivars you received. 
But of course, our users will appreciate it if you sell low and buy high, but this kind of donations won't help the market. What it needs is market makers.
It is important to remember that we give BsF 100 to every Venezuelan who signs up, so they can acquire their first bitcoin, and they will therefore buy at any asking price. In case you have the best offer, you could even make a small profit :) 
But most important is to help spread the word about Bitcoin remittances to Venezuelans.
@_date: 2014-11-30 05:06:13

SurBitcoin is not yet operational. They are running on "Charity mode", which means:
Everyone who signs up and submits their documents receives 200 Bolivares (= $2,50 with the black market rate / $33 with the official rate) to buy their first bitcoins.
The reason is simple: Running a charity that gives people money to buy bitcoins is not illegal anywhere in the world, and it also gives the SurBitcoin operators time to establish a good relationship with their bank that will be holding their users' bolivares.
The reason the support time took so long was that the SurBitcoin operators were overloaded with more than 600 emails from people who where completely new to bitcoin. And they had to verify every new user's documents manually.
At the same time, their bank was requesting additional information regarding their operations. Even though they were not yet accepting deposits they were processing withdrawals for people who were selling their bitcoins at the platform, and that delayed the whole process as well.
Venezuela is one of the most difficult countries to operate a Bitcoin Exchange. There are a lot of challenges, and SurBitcoin is being extremely careful to not piss off regulators or call bad attention from the media. 
Yes, the website has some misspellings, but this is mainly because Spanish is not my native language, therefore I made some mistakes. The code is open source. I would very much appreciate it if a native spanish speaker could give me a hand with a spell check:   
We are very happy that the Bitcoin community in Venezuela is being very supportive. They understand that if anything goes wrong, the Venezuelan government can BAN bitcoin, just like their politically aligned neighbors Bolivia and Ecuador.  
Btw, I am the founder of BlinkTrade, an open source bitcoin technology company and I am helping SurBitcoin with my software and advice on how to deal with Banks, Regulators, Media and Customer Support.

They promised to pay back all the investors, and they actually paid 99% of them .... they just didn't pay the TOP 1%.

100% confirmed. They claim they were hacked in Apr/2013, but they never provided any evidence of the hacking. They claim that showing the bitcoin address of the wallet that was hacked would disturb to their investigations, which is complete bullshit.
Rodrigo Batista joined the company in May/2013 as CEO. He then refunded the bitcoins of 99% of their users. The 1% who weren't refunded were those who had deposited the most bitcoins, a total of more than 2k BTC. 
When a group of users started to sue them in the Brazilian court in Nov/2013, Leandro Cesar left the company. Rodrigo Batista then started saying that the problem was caused by the previous co-founder (Cesar) and he wasn't responsible, and all the accusations were just competitors being jealous about their success.
The truth is that they ran a textbook ponzi scheme called Bitcoin Rain that was supposedly an investment fund in arbitrage opportunities between MercadoBitcoin and MtGox until some users requested their bitcoins back because of the bull market of March/2013, they decided to rob the users and claim that they were hacked. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 21:17:16
   
MercadoBitcoin is a well known scammer, just ask about them in the Brazil Bitcoin reddit or Brazil Bitcoin facebook group. They ran a scheme called Bitcoin Rain in the past.

Hi xygo,
MB only repaid 99% of their customers. They have never presented any evidence that they were hacked and the guy who ran bitcoin rain ponzi scheme was de facto a partner of the new founders until Dec/2013 ( The scheme collapsed on Abr/2013 ), and  He only left because investors required them to leave.
If you go to their facebook page and ask anything about this episode, instead of replying you they block you.  They also block you in case you ask a prof of solvency.
But of corse, people trust on them the same way people trusted on MtGox.

we don't hold much customer funds. Money is very hot in Venezuela. Approx 20k usd is frozen, and we are not allowing people to deposit bolivars either. We placed 20k usd worth of bitcoins for sale, so, people have an alternative.
Once we recover the api access, we will resume operations normally. 
The way people use surbitcoin is to sell and withdrawal right away, or deposit and buy right away too. 
Even we have avg volume of 40k usd per day, we move in our bank account avg 60k per day. 
We don't mind and hold some bolivars, but so far people are waiting for us to get our bank situation solved and not buying the coins we put for sale.

Bitcoin mining is huge in Venezuela. I would estimate  that there is around over 2k individual miners in Venezuela running old equipments. 
Venezuelans living abroad are effectively using bitcoin to send money to their families.
Everybody at least heard about Bitcoin, but the vast majority of the people still don't have information about how it works and how they can use.
Their currency is so unstable, that a lot of people are just buying bitcoin and holding as store of value, despite the bitcoin volatility. 
But unfortunately, it is still small. Education regarding bitcoin is not there yet. Running any kind of business in Venezuela is challenging, and the overall perception of the people there is that the government will persecute people who promote bitcoin or mining. 
Everyone we explain bitcoin in Venezuela, become a bitcoiner right away. The key to transform Venezuela into a bitcoin country is education. The momente merchants start accepting bitcoin, it will be the moment that exchanges will be useless in Venezuela. People will just use bitcoin instead of bolivars. But we are little far from that.
