I am putting 250% of my savings on Bitcoin. What are you talking about.

Bitcoin and bank deposits are substitutes. You buy bitcoin by taking deposit out of your bank and sell bitcoin to deposit the sale to your bank account. Furthermore, banks don't hold bitcoins as their asset portfolio. The low interest on saving means that banks are not interested to get your money. They have a lot money in the vault which is always ready to loan out but no one has wanted to borrow.

I exaggerated. But I thought it's interesting that banks don't have any hedging strategy against bitcoins because they don't hold them as an asset. So, value of their assets in all conventional form keep losing as the relative value of bitcoin surges in a relative sense.

I think the important point I realized is that banks do not hold bitcoins in their holding assets as far as I know. Banks hold financial securities (US treasuries, foreign currencies, gold, CP (commerical paper), money market, stock and cash and physical (real) assets), but I don't think any of them as an official policy hold "bitcoin" as their asset. Suppose they do, then the demand for bitcoin shoots up. Suppose they continue to ignore, then no one uses currency (like dollars) to store or to make a transaction through banks. Anyway, we win.

The tipping point comes when people who borrowed heavily from banks to buy Bitcoins come to a term of paying back. But we don't have that sort of information or even anecdotal episode. Before the housing market collapsed, it was already reported that a number of people with no enough income took a mortgage with high interest rate . Furthermore, the demand for houses is limited; people don't need two houses to stay at. On the hand other, the demand for bitcoin is unlimited while supply is limited. They are a lot of characteristics in Bitcoin that are not present in foreign currencies, or dollars.
