Best time to plant a tree 10 years ago. Second best time to plant a tree, right now.
Play with a testnet wallet first. You can get some from the various faucets.  Or reply to my post with a testnet address, I'll send when I see it.
Good advice from the wall of text that is currently the top comment.
Read the WhitePaper 
 Know Keys No Problem. No Keys Know Problem. 
     
321 Backup your seed.
Use secure communication.
Verify who you are trading with is reputable, and who they say they are.
Check the first and last few characters before you send. (Or all of them).
Buy and hold is for investing. Keep an eye on your investment, don't set it and forget it. Support the community participate some how, learn and teach others. Spend and replace.
Use escrow if buying something online. Use good spending habits.  Without escrow what's their incentive to deliver as promised.
Don't let yourself take unnecessary risks.  Exchanges are for trading. If you don't intend to trade, pull your Bitcoin out. Limit your Fiat transfers into/out of banks when reducing your exchange balance. I've heard many people have bank accounts shut down from doing multiple large transactions with crypto exchanges. Banks might be getting better now that they realize they need to adapt or go out of business. Use a Credit Union if you can.
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:32:02
Basic coinbase you can lock in the price at the start of the transfer (I think it's been a long time since I used it) but the fees end up around 3%. Similar to a store, you just bought an asset.
Coinbase pro you have to wait for the funds to clear, then you can set up the trade order. Similar to a brokerage you have to wait for a deposit to clear before you can start training.
You could also trade P2P hand someone cash, and they'd transfer BTC direct to your wallet.

Last year I was getting cloud mining offers, and binary options offers, and trading offers. Mostly on Instagram, all scams.
I reported to instagram, too 6 months for them to agree one was a scammer, and it got blocked, the rest are still active I think.
Went through the steps with one of them.  They want your email, then they setup a BlockChain wallet for you.  Then you log in, and change the password. Then you deposit btc.  
Since you change your pw a new person would think it's good. However BlockChain gives the 12 word seed to the creator, so now they have the seed.
I created my own BlockChain wallet, and deposited to that instead of theirs, and sent them the screenshot. They were confused why they couldn't find the BTC.  Then I informed them it's not nice to scam.  They kept defending themself it's not a scam.  So either persistence, or someone is above them, and they have no clue.  Also sent them to directory.io - it's a list of all private keys.  Hopefully they wasted a few hrs looking for a key with a balance. Check out the large Bitcoin collider for more info.

Will their profit model turn you into a multi trillionair in 5years? It's a scam.
Will they double your money in a week? Scam
Triple your money in a few hrs? You have to ask?
Look up 419 scam, see if it fits the model. Hey I'm going to make you rich, I just need about tree fiddy.
Weak hands to strong hands. Don't be weak handed scammer victim.

You are trading directly with a person.  Although some have a bot set up.
Filling out kyc and waiting for approval not required. Recently they added kyc requirements after $1500 transactions.
Paxful takes 1%, disputes are more likely, and they need support staff for it.
Sellers take the risk, there's not much risk to buyers.
Cash is most valuable and will have the best price.  PayPal and things like that have risk, and fees, A regular trader will have to pass those costs on.  A visa/mc gift card is worth less since it can only be used in certain places, and the trader will need to convert it back to cash or BTC.  An Amazon gift card worth even less since it can only be used at Amazon, although you can get almost anything, so still good. A store specific gift card worth even less.  With lower value items, you'll get higher prices.  Or higher risk things, iTunes cards tend to come from Nigerian irs scammers, or other scams. The Chinese will cash out the iTunes through an app they own to inflate their stats. LBC removed iTunes due to the heavy support requests, paxful increased fee to 5%.
After you have some good trades on paxful and other P2P sites you gain reputation.  As your reputation improves you will have access to better offers. Initial screening of potential buyers takes time and risk.
While trading with an individual you can probably ask them for a little info, and learn something new. Depends on the trader. Any time I meet someone new I ask their about their experience with BTC. If they are new, and have a time, I go over the basics of wallet setup, and transactions, to make sure they have a good knowledge base. Depending on a person's use case I might go over different things, and learn from others as well.

Coinbase, Cashapp, Gemini Full Custody. They have your cash and your crypto. Coinbase and Gemini USD is FDIC insured.
Abra 3/4 Custody (for lack of better term).  Abra has you USD.  And half of a multisig wallet. You have the other half.  
With full custody your funds can be taken, and enjoyed by an exit scamming exchange or the gov.  Coinbase and gemini won't exit scam, and the gov likely won't take the sites down. But if the gov says they want your money, the gov will get your money. Maybe someone has a similar name, and they make a mistake. You think the gov will compensate you fairly for their mistake?
3/4 Custody if the site goes down, they can't take your crypto. And you can't get it either.  But atleast no one be benefits from your loss. Fiat still at risk of gov.
Paxful/LocalBitcoins/... Bitcoin is in their control, goes into escrow.  Fiat is between you and the trade partner. Buying btc is safe. Selling, review the partner carefully. Chargeback is possible after a trade is completed.  
Bisq, double bonded multisig.  Bitcoin stays in escrow with your keys.  Buying is safe. Selling is being made safer.  Altcoin buy/sell is safe.
Chargebacks are a problem with the Fiat system. Not BTC. Chargebacks are one of the reasons kyc is needed. Also think of the "children" or "terrorists" for why exchanges need kyc.

Telegram is fairly secure, so unlikely modified being transmitted.
Clipjack virus will detect a Bitcoin address in your clipboard, and replace it with the virus Creator's address.  There's a more advanced version that even does a little vanity gen to make the first couple of characters the same.
Multi signature is where the Bitcoin keys are shared with a number of people.  And a number of those people need to approve any out going transaction.
2of3 multisig is very common. 2 signers required, out of 3.  It can be used for personal security and convince between multiple devices, or in family/friends, for business partners, or for buyer/seller/escrow.
With 2 of 3 buyer/seller/escrow. The buyer deposits into the wallet. Seller sends product/service. Seller requests withdraw.  Buyer waits till they are satisfied with the product/service, and approves the withdraw.  If there is a problem, the buyer/seller  can dispute with the escrow. The escrow will make a decision based on evidence provided by both.
Openbazaar automates the multisig setup process.  You can also manually setup a multisig wallet with Electrum or Copay/Bitpay wallet.
Bitrated is also an automatic multisig wallet.  No store listings though.
All of those mentioned you select your escrow person.  On sites like localbitcoins and paxful.  The site is the escrow, you don't get to pick what employee reviews a dispute.

I've traded with them. There are others out there.  
I have a gift card offer too. But I tend to do the larger cards with cash on short notice (none in stock I go buy them on demand).  Small cards aren't worth it to me on short notice and steam tends to be smaller cards.  I might start offering small cards, order to be filled in 24hrs.
@_date: 2019-07-04 14:38:05
If your debit card has a transfer method check paxful for someone that does that transfer method.
Hopefully the method is based on email or something, not the card number. It's safer to not give out the card number.
Review the trader carefully. The best price offers are at the top. Usually low reputation new traders that will charge back, or try to get you to release early, or scam some other way.
Start looking for serious honest traders slightly below spot price. Check their profile for reputation.

If the atm really is around 3% it's a good price.
BTMs in Las Vegas are 6% to 25% most are around 10%.
Most will need your phone number, and give you a ~$500 limit to go over $500 you'd need to do kyc,and since under 18 won't work for you. The limit is daily so if you need to go over, might have to make multiple trips.

Sounds like scammer from the rest of the comments.
Other possibilities.
Wallet not synced, but BlockChain online wallet so that's not it.
Communication intercepted and address altered. Email is not secure without pgp. Text is not secure.  Too late now to verify, you could use secure communication now, and they could still lie about address being correct now.
Clipjack virus, address got altered. Virus could be on your end or their end.  Who ever had the virus is at fault.
Openbazaar store with escrow would eliminate many of the problems.

There's a bunch of gift shops in the spot described.. Its the one in the building south of the Harley Davidson Cafe.  North of the 7-11.  At the "Souvenirs Mini-Mart". The machine is right by the entrance can't miss it.
The limit it gave me was about 6.6k to buy and 10k so I'm guessing its been used to buy a few BTC already.

Got an email from vanity gen about an hr ago:
We have just discovered that the site was hacked on the 31st Dec 2013.
They put some code in the page calckey that sent them the key if you used
that page to calculate your private key rather than usingbitaddress.org.
Please move any coins you have at addresses that were generated using
this page.
Please see forum page for updates.
The site will now be shutdown, as we only ran it for fun, and it is now
not fun.
Any addresses bought since 31st Dec 2013 will be refunded on request via
forum. This may take a while as we will do all in one go (and all our
coins you paid us were taken so we need to get some!).
The original mail we sent you is below so you know what the address is:
            Dear BitcoinVanity user,
We have found a key for your prefix.
Prefix         : 1
Rest of my info omitted.
My older vanity Addy seems to be unaffected. But I moved coins out anyway.  The affected ones only have enough for a tx fee.

If the officer is in public, it should be released as public.  Once they enter private property, it should be private.  One more button to push, and will be forgotten, or some lines of code, and a GPS or something. 
I don't think I want to pay for the hosting for people to watch hrs of cop footage.  Maybe only make public 1min snap shots.  But the person wanting to see video would have to pay (or view ads).  Great way to raise some money too.  If an incident ends up in court the video should be made public and free (in 480p, leave the 1080 for people to pay them self), after the judge/jury's final decision.

Its an interesting idea, when I first saw it, it was for taking one cryptocoin for altcoin. So the money was tied up for just a few minutes.  Money out of pocket becomes a bigger issue with physical items, I guess faster shipping is encouraged.
Also if there is a dispute all coins involved (except mining fees and change) get destroid, if no agreement is reached.
I think this system can be used in Bitcoin 2.0 without the 3rd party.
But yes mocking anyone who will trust money with a 3rd party facilitating illegal activity. Not trying to say anything bad about nashx.  People do need a way around unjust laws.

All of my twitter tips have come back to me.  I think I've gotten one change tip (including from the other similar bots) on reddit, and maybe one on twitter. I may have gotten some on bitcointalk, but that would mostly be from a thread requesting an ad in my Sig or something. And it went direct to my address.
If someone gets $1 one time, its not worth it to look into it, and set up the account.  If someone gets $0.03 a bunch of times (doge) it will probably annoy them. But $5+ a few times might get their interest.
I give cash tips when I go some place, in the normal amount then give a bonus $1 or $5 with a Bctip.org card. Only about 10% of those have been claimed. Or if they have a smart phone on them, bonus tip on their new wallet

Certain grammar errors and typos are sometimes a red flag. There are a few in there.
Not sure why $530 instead of 500, maybe some of your other messages would clear that up, if its part of a deal, why not change the exchange rate.  I can see something for $5 because of the MP fee.
No reason to mention PayPal, not sure why its in there.
Out of town can be a red flag. Shouldn't matter if you have a smartphone or laptop. Not sure if it is an excuse for delays.
What is the seller's rating? Is escrow enabled?
I would do a smaller amount the first few times.
It is normal to send a picture of the receipt, MP has a risk of charge back, and it is one way for a seller (honest or scammer to limit this.
The bitcoin-otc guide has some safety suggestions good to read those in addition to what's on local Bitcoins.
Also MP takes about 15 min from time of purchase to be usable, so not exactly instant. I'm not sure what they mean by its registered in their name after they call.

Yes, next price climb im guessing broad range 3x to 20x in the next week to 3 years.  My best guess is 5x to 8x sometime in the next month to 2 years. With a larger move as it gets closer to the end of the time range. With confidence also going up as we get closer to the end of the range.  It will also probably fall after the big climb, 30-50% I haven't thought much about how much it climbs will affect how much it falls.
Winklevoss ETF is a few months(?) away I think within a week after (same day) we could see the price go up a lot, could see the climb last a month.
Block reward halving is about 2 years away. Speculation of the event could raise the price a little berfor, or soon after. 
Yes I'm somewhat vague, I don't know for sure what it will do, and no one does.  I hope I'm right, and I think many other bitcoiners I think have a similar guess.

Gavin described the fork, I don't remember exactly what was said but something like when 80% of the network is on the new software it will switch over.
edit: 
Next we need a soft fork to deal with some longstanding technical debt related to the recent OpenSSL-was-willing-to-validate-too-much-stuff problem. Pieter Wuille and Gregory Maxwell have been working through that.
But then we need a concrete proposal for exactly how to increase the size. Here's what I will propose:
Current rules if no consensus as measured by block.nVersion supermajority.
Supermajority defined as: 800 of last 1000 blocks have block.nVersion == 4
Once supermajority attained, block.nVersion &lt; 4 blocks rejected.
After consensus reached: replace MAX_BLOCK_SIZE with a size calculated based on starting at 2^24 bytes (~16.7MB) as of 1 Jan 2015 (block 336,861) and doubling every 6*24*365*2 blocks -- about 40% year-on-year growth. Stopping after 10 doublings.
The perfect exponential function:
size = 2^24 * 2^((blocknumber-336,861)/(6*24*365*2))
... is approximated using 64-bit-integer math as follows:
double_epoch = 6*24*365*2 = 105120
(doublings, remainder) = divmod(blocknumber-336861, double_epoch)
if doublings &gt;= 10 : (doublings, remainder) = (10, 0)
interpolate = floor ((2^24 &lt;&lt; doublings) * remainder / double_epoch)
max_block_size = (2^24 &lt;&lt; doublings) + interpolate
This is a piecewise linear interpolation between doublings, with maximum allowed size increasing a little bit every block.

At $1 max possible current transaction could be about $14m,  if someone tried to do a transaction of this amount, and then it was put on a currency exchange it would have a major affect on price.
$14m seems like a lot to most people, especially if you only think about your own needs, so think of it like this.  What if 1000 btc was worth $0.01, that would mean the largest transaction currently possible would be to spend $140.00 might be fun for kids to play with, but useless for most adults.  $14m is useless to $B companies.

i'm clicking back to the climb to 1200 in Nov 2013, curious to see what it looks like..
was loading quickly up till mid june.  if I clicked slowly the new page would load in a sec. Click quickly and it would take longer.  I clicked quickly to Nov 2013 and its very slow, I came here to type this and it still hasn't loaded (the data, page is there though).  I'm guessing its loading all the days inbetween, that I'm not very interested in. Hope this helps.
I'm headed out to get my CES badge, will update when I back home (Vegas local).

That would take about 4.5M BTC at the current price, or 1/3 of currently mined coins.

10 years ago I was in Venezuela to inspect a refinery, sky caps, cab drivers, concierge, and hookers were all happy to exchange USD for Bolivar.  I think I saw an article recently that hookers are making more money exchanging, than providing "companionship".  
One of the guys I met down there was an american that had been there for an extended time, he had found some good rates for either direction. We usually did a couple thousand USD at a time.  If not for him, the cab driver was the one we met that was able to provide the best rates.

@_date: 2017-03-05 08:33:02
It's a balance of power.
With mining fees approaching 1 days pay for someone in the 3rd world It keeps them out.
Node opperators, devs and users balance out the power.  If you go against what these groups believe is how bitcoin they will go against you.  
The devs can put out updates, and other users can adopt them or not.  Updates like segwit or unlimited.  Updates like a change in mining algorithm. And other updates that are yet to be thought of.  If people agree they will use it.
The node operators get the balancing vote.  Your blocks will get rejected if enough get together and pick a protocol.
The users. These are the ones that pay your mining.  They pay the fees, and give value to the coin.  That value can be fiat tied, or tied to some amount of time for services.  If you alienate the users you can mine all the worthless coins you want.  This the extent of the user vote.
Mining is subsided by block rewards, and decreases approximately every 4 years.  Each time it becomes more and more important for the user base to grow.
I'd love to see miners getting 13btc/block in tx fees.  But not if it means each person is pay 0.01 BTC.  I want to see millions of people paying 0.000001 BTC.  It's not going to happen in the next 4 years.  After the next halvening event the users will have even more power, the miners will be working for them more and the subsidy will be less relevant. 
When the user base dies off the exchange rate goes down.  Looking for short term profit by abusing the system at scale hurts the network, and the goals of what people believe Bitcoin can do for the world as a way to increase productivity, honesty, censorship, access to free speech.
There are probably many aspects in don't fully understand, and I am still trying to decide segwit/bu. Right now any way to get the fees down, and the mempool unclogged so that any new user can have a good experience is what I'll support, and both of them do that. I'm think Jihan Wu is very intelligent and must have good intentions, but I'm failing to see them.  It seems like he is abusing a weakness in the system, and since Bitcoin is anti-fragile there will be a correction.  Not sure if he is playing devil's advocate.
The exchanges were a weakpoint in the days of mtgox.  Now they have proof of reserves, and places like localbitcoins, and bitsquare are increasing in volume.
Mining pools were a weakpoint when ghash hit 51% of the mining power. And they are a weak point again with antpool abusing its power.
I think the devs need to be more decentralized, and it is becoming more of an issue, but not a big one yet. XT/classic/unlimited are a start.  Altcoins play their part too.  There's a very limited number of people who can actually develop.  Almost anyone could run a node or mine.  
That attitude of pushing people away from mining because it is not profitable on a small scale is part of why we are here. You can't compete with large numbers of hobbiests, mining small amounts at a small loss.  Or some people I've encountered, that will intentionally mine at a loss for a tax write-off, and they will mine at whatever pool I tell them (p2pool) for the good of the network.

Profit in terms of fiat or BTC.
They may be looking for the most BTC, but if they cripple the network they drive the value of btc down.

Yup, run your own p2pool, or point your miner to one that looks good to you.

By mining you might get a fraction of your own fees back, and you get a vote.

If you've been trading on lbc enough your reputation might be enough for some traders to skip id on certain payment options.
Might want to pick a different payment option, as a debit card is one of the types that is most likely to need an ID.
Maybe find someone that offers what you want, and see if they have other payment options, see if their other optionsg don't need an ID and gain their trust though that.
Don't think there's many traders on lbc that will even accept a debit card.  Might check paxful too.

maybe satoshi has a few nodes and/or miners running and is voting?
@_date: 2018-10-22 09:58:19
Bisk is currently probably the closest thing to what satoshi would want as an exchange.
escrow, and double bonded, protects both buyer and seller.
Its a desktop application, open source, so it can't be shut down.
It is a little slow.  One person sets up a bid/ask offer, and someone else takes it.
the person setting up the offer might be afk when the taker starts the trade.
new android/ios app brings notifications to the phone so its quicker now.
then wait for a bitcoin confirmation.
then the buyer pays in fiat or altcoin.
then mark paid. and wait for the seller to release.
a few altcoins were available, but there's been limited trade volume with alts as the escrow coin, so support for some has been dropped.

They would be using a bank. 
There are traders on localbitcoins and paxful that might accept check by mail, or a check deposit to their bank.  But as a new user they will be unlikely to trust your check.  You will also pay a much higher price for Bitcoin if you buy with a check than with cash.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:11:41
You didn't send money to wall of coins.
You sent it to some other person on the site.
Wall of coins is the escrow middle man, and controls the keys.
The person who you paid can only confirm or deny they got a payment to wall of coins.
I used it a long time ago. But didn't like them being the one in almost total control.
Your option is to go through woc steps and wait. Or go to the bank and complain.  If you complain to the bank, the account holder will probably have their account closed or worse frozen, and it's not even the account holders fault.

Could be automated for big business.  Some service would have to be set up, and the big company would have to add a few lines of code to their store.
But currently there is nothing out there, they'd have to make their own openbazaar store and spend many man hrs to list each item.
Maybe someone could create a transfer tool for openbazaar so compiens could export thier store, and import it to openbazaar.  And from there would need some interface to handle the sales. Maybe those tolls are already out there and I don't know of them.
Hopefully some people are inspired to add these features. I'm not good enough at coding, and don't have the patience to get that good.

My old verification on LBC puts me at $1k per year limit with the new requirements
The new verification requirements are more than I'm interested in providing, and is too much like every other heavily regulated exchange.
There's going to be a drop in users with the stricter requirements.  And they removed the cash in person which is where I did most of my trades.
With the loss in trade volume, not worth it for me to continue.

The trader doesn't really get 20%.
There are costs in converting that card back to cash or Bitcoin.
Better to use some cash related method. 
Depends on trade amount, some options involve flat fees in addition to the % a trader wants.  Digital payments (PayPal, zelle) are higher risk to the BTC seller, so their price will be higher. And they'll want verification. Not sure on age requirement of those services too.
Cash doesn't care about age.
Bisq already mentioned by someone else is good.

I've bought many Amazon gift cards with cash at my local store for people on localbitcoins and paxful.
A few months ago, regulars complained about cards not working. Usually someone outside USA.  Had to send faxes of the card and receipt.
Most of them have stopped using Amazon.  Amazon is using some detection program to tell if your gift card is 3rd party or not. And from what I've seen with other P2P traders Amazon is getting stricter, and locking accounts with funds up.
I would expect Amazon to appreciate the extra business.  I'm guessing they are having to deal with too many fraudulent cards, and over reacting.  Or government is pressuring them.

At this point no kyc will mostly limit you to about $300-500
Bitcoin ATMs will need more than your phone over those amounts usually.
MoneyGram Western Union and Walmart 2Walmart will probably ask for id.  You might (more likely under $300) be able to give a random name, but if the transaction fails, you'll have a hard time getting a refund without id.
US bank I think can still do under $500 cash into personal account no id. Credit unions will vary.  Most of the big banks cash deposit will need id. Money order may not need an Id, goes to $1k for most.
You do not need an account with any bank or cu to make a deposit to someone's account.
Gift cards some places will scan id at $300.  Paxful and localbitcoins needs id verification, over $1k total volume.  And LBC has reduced their options.
Bisq Fiat is limited to 0.0625 BTC to start.  After some time, and no complaints of scamming you'll be able todo 0.25 BTC to fiat.  And 2btc to altcoins any time (including some stable coins)

You might even be able to find that stuff cheaper, since the vendor doesn't have to worry about chargebacks, and the 2-3% cc fee.

Some of those StableCoins can also get UpTo 10% apr on compound.  Stable coins can become unstable though.

Send from cash app to a wallet you own the keys to (you'd know if your wrote down 12 words) and send from that wallet to your friend.

You can get a USB stick for $10
Download and install Tails Linux onto the USB stick to boot from it.
It comes with Electrum.
Create a new wallet in Electrum.
You could just download Electrum.  Or any other wallet 
And 321 back up your seed phrase
3 copies, 2 mediums, 1 off site.
Write in a way that if someone else finds it they can't get the actual seed. Use a passphrase, reorganize the words. Keep those backups safe.
That's for long-term large storage.
Short term a phone wallet, and hot wallet on the desktop, or shared wallet between the two.
Spend and replace. If everyone only invests, there is no value, it needs to be used aswell.  If you want your investment to perform, work on it.

Coinbase is an exchange, not a wallet. Yubi key is a good 2 factor, but it's not your keys.
You don't need a hardware wallet. But a wallet that only you have the keys to is important.
You can put tails on a $5 (or free at convention) USB memory stick. Startup from tails, write down your seed from Electrum and put your long term savings there.
3-2-1 Backup.  3 copies, 2 mediums (paper/file on usb stick) 1 off site.
Move some daily spending to a hot wallet. Maybe a multisig.
Spend and replace.  If everyone buys and hodles there no value added to the speculation..
Openbazaar suggested as a market place.
Bisq suggested as an exchange.

The closer to cash you are the closer to spot prices will be.
A prepaid debit card is closer to cash, than Amazon.  Amazon can get almost anything so it's closer to cash than Newegg or bestbuy.
Amazon is against gift card trading. They have added various detection methods in the last year or so.  Even an honestly purchased cash gift card will get an account shut down eventually.
Giftcards that are advertised to your benefit are reasonable UpTo about 30% discount.  I offered cards purchased with cash, about 5% cost (so other side of spot from discounted cards). I was trading them daily.  Much more than that and you are looking at scammed cards.

WU is meant for sending money between actual friends and family.
If you use it often for larger amounts, eventually they will cut you off.  You would think they'd enjoy collecting the high fees.
Buying btc with Wu is safe for the buyer. Just keep all trade discussion on paxful. Mark paid when you've sent. Keep an eye on the trade expiration time.
It's common ( was a couple years ago, not sure if theyve gotten better) for Wu terminals to be out of service. But it's also common for scammers to claim it.  If they ask you to cancel, get a refund from wu first, then cancel escrow on pax.

321 backup your seed phrase- 12 words depending on wallet.  
3 copies.  
2 mediums.  
1 off site.
Multisignature is like a joint bank account. But more advanced, quicker and easier to setup.
Colored coins special use bitcoins, and may be more valuable.
Electrum wallet suggested.
Try it out on testnet (no value, behaves the same.)
Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.
Always involve your own keys in a transaction.
Check the first and last few characters.. incase of clipjack virus.. or simply copying one, and not copyinqg the next one, sending to the previous recipient.
Once sent, it's gone. So trust who you are sending to. Or use escrow (multisig) and make sure the escrow is reliable.
Make sure you are communicating with who you think your are communicating with.
Make sure you use secure communication.
Don't invest in pyramids/Ponzi or other scams like binary options or cloud mining.
Bitcoin is private, not anonymous. Don't use it for stupid illegal stuff, it can be tracked.
Use a more secure wallet for long term larger storage. And a quick easy to use wallet for daily/weekly spending.
Use a password manager.
Use 2fa
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
Past performance in not an indicator of future returns.
Buy, hodl some, trade some, spend and replace some.
Learn and teach.
Taxation is theft.  Printing money is theft.
Don't send your id to random exchanges.
Try a small amount on an exchange, make sure you can withdraw... Some scam exchanges are away of small tests and will still allow small amounts, the hold the large amount.
Bitcoin is permissionless anyone can participate (with internet access).
Bitcoin was meant for freedom, and programmable money. Not a get rich quick though speculation. It is reasonable to guess the value will go up in the next few years though.
Not much to using it.   
 Account/public key/addresd(invoice is more appropriate) to send to.
Amount to send.
There's an exchange rate.  Exchanges will be slightly off from each other.
The back end and mining, doesn't need to be known. But is helpful.  Brodcast is instant. Blocks happen every 10 minutes on average.  Mining fees will get you a confirmation in the next block as long as there's room.  Once filled it goes by highest bidder/byte. 21M total supply.  Currently 12.5 BTC goes to the miners with each confirmation.  In 4 months it gets reduced to 6.25.  and every ~4years (ends up 3.5) cut in half again.  The miners also collect the mining fees. 
Bitcoin is an experiment.  Altcoins are an experiment on an experiment.

Localbitcoins and paxful require kyc to create ads. Responding to ads might need kyc depends on the ad.  After a certain amount the one responding to ads will have to kyc.
Mycelium had/has a bug the doesn't allow the transaction to complete in the trade. But you can manually send (if you are honest).
Bisq doesn't have much activity. But they just launched 1.0 and it has been picking up.
Openbazaar not much activity.  I have seen a jump in disputes recently so must be picking up too.  Haven (mobile version of OB) is in private beta. OpenBazaar is more for things/services, and altcoins. Not much Fiat to/from crypto.

Bitcoin ATM's are still an issue.
I've gone through proper saliva and retina submissions for the machines here in Vegas.
First there was Robocoin at the D, it was always sold out.
They replaced it, and for a week it was great, cash and a btc Addy was all you needed.
Software update on the machine needs phone, pin, and an id.
Last week the new software asked for my info, I re entered it, but the camera isn't very good, so they got a blurry image. 
Yesterday I got an email about my account resubmission.  
Today I went to use the Robocoin on the strip, they are still verifying my re submission. (Both machines use same id system, but for some reason at the d it didn't recognize my old account)
So I made a new account with a different phone number. I'm guessing they won't like that.  Stuck some cash in, got some coins out, then got a text about a hardware error.
Someone get your stuff on the same page
Its around 12% for the machine at the d it doesn't tell me, they just post a buy and sell price, and I have to pick an exchange and do some math
on the strip, it gives a price and the markup (6%)

I've tried giving people $5 worth of bitcoin with bctip.org on a business card size piece of paper, most people don't redeem them, unless they are into tech stuff. some are still afraid they might get a virus or get their bank hacked or something.
lately i've only been giving away $1 worth (low btc price, and other things not letting me be as generous).  But I could probably put $20 or even $100 on each card, if they aren't the type to claim it they won't.  the card expires 1 month after I make it, when that happens, the coins go back to my wallet.
It give me a little comfort in attempting to give out more, knowing that only 10% of them will get redeemed, so I don't actually spend as much.
I mostly give them with a tip at a restaurant or someplace people normally tip, 2/3 in normal cash that make an average tip, and the other 1/3 in BTC that make it a little extra.
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:21:26

Gbtc order books are thin, so it's a little tough to get in even if your buy limit order is a little above ask or out if your sell limit order is a little below bid.  Definitely would not place a market order.
It's over priced.  1 share of gbtc is about 0.09 btc.  Puts btc value at a little over $1k when market rate is about $680.  
I was going to go in on Monday since the btc price went up over the weekend, was surprised to see the price jump on GBTC was delayed a day.

in place of block count, maybe have a timer/progressbar not sure how to deal with the 5-20min variation of the progressbar, guess you'd need to factor in Thash/sec of the network with difficulty. to indicate when the last one was made, so you have an idea when your transaction will get confirmed.

I have a small amount on various exchanges, with buy low and sell high orders set.  After I get a notification of a trade going through, I set a new order up. After a major price change I set some new orders up.  My orders are set for major changes. It seems like any time it has a major movement it is temporary and returns to the average.

Peter kept trying to say a currency needs to be backed by gold
Bitcoin is decentralized, and so its backing is decentralized. I would consider every transaction to be something backing the BitCoin. Trade USD for BTC on MtGox or bitstamp or ... that's USD backing.  Buy gold with BTC on bitmit or coinabul or in person or anywhere else that transaction is recorded in the BlockChain, and is a record of what BitCoin is useful for. Any transaction has at least 2 people who know what that transaction was (except transferring to/from your own wallet and maybe other scenario I can't think of.) Even stolen coins 2 people know, one persons carelessness and some other persons dishonesty.  Bitcoin is backed by every transaction that has been made, that includes GPUs, altcoins, alpaca socks, food, weed, food, hosting, startup shares, girlsgonebicoin, doctors, lawyers, everything.  The best backing is a decentralized backing.  Gold can be confiscated, but you can't confiscate, destroy or ban all the goods and services that the BitCoin community offers and consumes.

Brother John F has some good explanations of what's going on.  He's still looking at $3k peak.
I like to hold some coins in a safe wallet, and keep some on the exchanges, to buy on the dip and sell on the spike.  With all the exchanges this takes a while to set up and I haven't kept up with it.

I would suggest deciding a percentage to keep in various locations:   
Offline.  
Online.  
On an exchange ( or few).  
On the phone.
I would suggest keeping $20-100 or 1Btc and some change as spendable from the phone. This way you can share with other people and give an demo or trade if anyone asks. Strengthening the network.  As you spend you might want to replenish it.

Charge Back...
People will use paypal or a credit card to buy bitcoin.  then contact PP, or CC company and say they never got the goods.  PP/CC reverses the charges, scammer now has money and bitcoin. Seller has nothing. Not many are willing to take the risk.  
If Paypal is what you want to use, you might want to first exchange that to LibertyReserve.  or build up a reputation on irc.freenode.net  and  
Credit Card buy second life lindens, and exchange for bitcoin.  there might be a few other ways.
Mining is good, if you have high end graphics cards or are interested in specialty hardware. I like Triple Mining, manly because of its referral program.
Many ways to get some
Sell stuff on bitmit.net  its like ebay
forbitcoin.com its like fiverr.
theres a site similar to amazon turk, can't think of it right now.
theres two twitter bots that I know of that are similar to the reddit tip bot. along with a twitter paid ad site, but its been down for a while.

I need more like this...
if anyone has any from that imitate MTGOX, would appreciate it..
Friend took GoDaddy to court for Hosting MTQCX.com Realized his chances arn't good against GoDaddy, and a lawyer.
GoDaddy's requested to dismiss, based on Case of EBay, vs someone, finding that ebay is not responsible for products.
I went with him, to help argue for him.
Judge decided not to dismiss, Judge said he was interested and wanted to hear the who case, but had to send it to mediation first.  Mediation on January 10th.
Judge said biggest thing in our favor is that it is something GoDaddy repeatedly looks the other way.  Have documents for MTPCX.com also hosted on godaddy.
If anyone else Lost BTC/USD or was a victim of a phishing site to GOX, or one that was hosted on godaddy, that would be helpful.
Friend realizes he made a dumb mistake, and may not win.  however this will be somewhat costly for them, and they may start to revise some policies so these phishers.
