Except that you need to register and provide your details there. Also many vendors ask for you to provide them even more details about yourself.

Anyone else didn't get a reminder from RemindMeBot? -.-

I'm all up for a hardfork, but it has to be the right hardfork.
 All these blockchain size increasing forks around us are so arbitrary, and they have the risk of making it come even sooner that we won't be able to store the blockchain on our own computers anymore.
I want a future, more well thought out hardfork that could solve multiple problems at once while also trying to solve it by not having as many downsides such as the blockchain size scalability problem.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:53:23
I only said hard fork. I don't necessarily mean increase the block size. Whatever good hardfork solution people come up with, and of course the bitcoin core team need to agree on it too.

That would sound good, however isn't a channel only good for transacting with 1 person? In which case if you only transact once with each person, you would still pay the same amount of tx fees as if you weren't even using LN
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:10:33
I don't get it. How will there be "next to no fee" when supposedly even for Lightning transactions in the end you still need a real Bitcoin transaction to settle the Lightning transactions into the proper blockchain. Wouldn't that still cost the standard amount of transaction fees to settle?

"Just google it!"
How do you think things become googleable if not by people receiving answers to questions in forums.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:27:28
I thought it settled automatically by time.
In every example video I've seen, Alice and Bob exchange funds in the Lightning Network, but that their channel automatically closes in 1 month, at which point the large amount of transaction fees would need to be spent, even if it was only a coffee that was bought.
Please help me find where I'm misunderstanding the whole thing.

Yes, Opera was first with that. Then Firefox took the idea, then Chrome copied Firefox :P
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:53:39
Opera used to be great up until version 12. Back then it had a bunch of cool stuff bundled, like an IRC client, a mailing client, a torrent client. Also it had really good services built in that would run on your computer, and remotely you could listen to your computer's music, or send someone a link where they could easily upload a file to your computer.
Then they jumped to Opera 15 (I think) where they replaced Opera's rendering engine (which was a bit slow to be honest) to Webkit... but besides that they stripped out all of the functionality it had before, and essentially became a Chrome clone with some stuff taken out compared to Chrome.
I last checked about 2-3 years ago to be honest, but please tell me I'm wrong and that Opera is by now at least half the browser it used to be.

This could be the next MtGox, right? Meaning I should be wary and not store too much Bitcoin I'd feel devastated to lose

We've passed the first safe haven. Buy to your heart's content!

Any good Android SegWit HD wallets out there to make use of SegWit?
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:25:09
Any good HD wallets supporting SegWit?
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:29:05
Finally, a popular HD wallet has support for SegWit!
...but wait, how come the bech32 QR code is bigger than the older Bitcoin addresses? AFAIK bech32 is supposed to result in a smaller QR code.

Also as a reminder for 2 years later, the value of BTC today is $4467.39

You won't be alive in a hundred years, why would you want to be reminded? xD
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:37:49
Probably you could invest in a very little amount depending on how much risk you can take. Maybe $10? By the time you'd have more money at like, say, 30, the value could have increased by then to a larger amount than you would initially invest at that age anyway, despite making a lot more money.
Just don't forget to keep your private keys secure and also ensure that you'll definitely be able to access them, accounting for possibly forgetting passwords and pins and stuff.
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:35:38
I got it an hour ago or so too :D
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:29:55
increasing adoption will make fees actually increase, because more transactions would be competing to get inside the blockchain. This is one of the big issues in general.
