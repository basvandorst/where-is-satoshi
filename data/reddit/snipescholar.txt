Could someone explain to me why exactly this is this case?  If we had a block size increase to say 8mb, surely our computers could handle this?

A 51% attack would cause people to loose faith in the system since it allows the attacker could double spend bitcoins.  I agree it would be expensive, and those funds would be lost, but if bitcoin posed a serious threat to these governments, they would be incentivized to do it.
$3B is a lot for you and me but not really all that much for a state power.

I'm not saying its easy, just plausible.  What if only one state actor begins amassing ASICs, or if many state actors collude?  If their goal is to destroy the system, it wouldn't make sense for them to compete in an arms race.  I definitely would like bitcoin to be resistant to these kinds of attacks, so I'm curious about your reasoning on this.
Also, what would you say is the most effective way for a state actor to attack bitcoin?

If I understand you correctly, you're saying that a 51% attack is not easy in the first place, and even if it were to happen, it would be okay since we can hardfork and purge the ledger of any double spends.  I'm not entirely convinced.
As I said before, there are many major powers who could scrape together $3B. For reference, Brazil spent ~15B on the World Cup alone, and the US spent ~$3.5T in 2016.
To your point about hardforking the network to a new PoW, I'm not sure this would really solve the problem.  Sure, a hardfork invalidates all the attacker's miners, but you also invalidate all the honest ASICs in the same process.  Now you have a new network with much less security that is cheaper to attack.  If the attacker spent the money once, they likely can do it again, each time significantly dropping the trust in the system.  How many successful attacks can bitcoin endure?

A 51% attack is estimated to cost $3B.  I think Argentina or Brazil could take it down.
