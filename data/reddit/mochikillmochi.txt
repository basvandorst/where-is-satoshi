Oh snap thank you!! 
Nothing to apologize for. I appreciate your concern and i head your warning. I have heard/read of some crazy bitcoin scams. I don't mind the alt coins i have only put up a dollar or so to them. I just really want to be part of the whole bitcoin community as well as using this as currency. I love the concept and want to support it. Its just so high right now i dont know what to do besides wait for a  heavy drop. 
I am not ashamed to admit i am ignorant of a lot pertaining to cryptocurrency and i am still researching. So any advice is good advice.

I know the name of them. One is stock in a company and the other is bitcoin cash. Just didn't have the name at time of post due to hasty texting. 
I have reached them. I know what they are. Just not where to spend bitcoin other than dark and deep web.

With bitcoin or deepweb?

Lmao! My bf wants to invest too. He just didn't know you can put in whatever, we both thought you had to match the value or you get nothing. I only knew because i gave it a chance to see if it worked. 
Its hard not to keep myself from checking in constantly but i dont think i will see a big profit as i can't match the amount and i get a very very small percentage.
