Or the Bitcoin wiki, or Bitcointalk, or really anywhere that you can discuss Bitcoin.  As long as you don't actually interact with another Bitcoin enthusiast, you can avoid deceptive people.

Moving a decentalized system isn't nearly as straightforward as you make it out to be.
Remember that an attempt to implement a block size increase happened once before.  It caused a hard fork, and after a day or so of arguing, the miners (technically a handful of pool operators) determined which version was going to be used (the one without the block size increase) and that's Bitcoin as it is known today.

Ben correctly pointed out that Moolah was a scam a few months before it happened.  I believe the general response on r/Bitcoin when he tried warning you was pretty similar to yours here, even though he was doing you a great service.

You cannot get away from the current miners without abandoning all your Bitcoins and starting another altcoin.  What "Bitcoin" is is determined by the majority of computing power: the miners.  That's a core property of the trustless network.
You could call your altcoin "The True Bitcoin" and try to set it up in a way that mimics the current Bitcoin wealth distribution, but it's not Bitcoin.  Also, unless you go in a radically different direction and centralize it, it's still going to be controlled by the people with the mining hardware, even if that's different hardware than SHA-256 miners.  
And there should be concern about miners rejecting a block increase.  History is full of people who pursue small short term gains at the expense of long term ruination.

Users, merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc give value to the network, but miners control the network.  If the miners colluded to require 1 bitcoin minimum fee on all transactions, then you pay 1 bitcoin on all transactions or you abandon your bitcoin holdings.  That is control.
Also you can't get around this theoretical miner cartel in a way that saves your bitcoins, the people with the computing power also control any fork or variant you would like.

Why does Bitcoin need to be involved at all?  All changetips are handled on a centralized server, it would greatly expand tipping if you could Paypal Euro or USD to them.  All tips are already demarked in USD, so it would be a simpler system to remove bits.

That is false, since there's a minimum Bitcoin as well before you can move out of Changetip.  Moving Bitcoin into changetip requires either a transaction fee (same as cash), or significant amounts of your time as you monitor whether your feeless transaction got orphaned or not.  
My point is that the tips are not bitcoin transactions, they're fee-free transactions on changetip's server and only on changetip's server.  They would function exactly the same if they were denominated in dollars, bits, or Canadian Tire Money.

"Valid" is determined by the majority of the network.  If you have a client with a new ruleset that requires 80% adoption before forking, at the time of the fork, the new ruleset is the valid one and the old ruleset is now invalid.

Bitcoin swings in 2015:  ±20% of the average value.  (40% spread from high to low)
Canadian Dollar swings over same time: ±5% (10% spread)
Not even the same dimension of volatility.  Bitcoin has moved by 7% *this week*

I'm sure you've got a good handle on the actually complicated crypto stuff, even though "stickers" appear to be a bit tricky for your company.
