Nice time-frame, let's apply that over 5 years, how's it looking now?

Seems like a good bullish statement, but I've heard previously Malta wasn't too keen on bitcoin companies, with banks even closing down companies who operate there? Any locals with an insight? Do the statements reflect the reality?

I'd estimate 100,000 - Tim has a little bit of a vested interest in btc reaching a high price - but who know's if it's 250 k even better!

Avoid paying commission fees by paying cash? More like avoiding paying tax by not going through a legitimate exchange no doubt.

Good characteristics of money include;
Durability, Portability, Divisibility, Uniformity, Limited Supply, Acceptability.
Bitcoin wins overall on these point. So Bitcoin does have better characteristic than gold as a store of wealth, will it ever truly replace it? that's another matter.

All the while they track your transaction? And arbitrarily freeze accounts ? Sure they should make a profit, but coinbase is the orwellian 'big brother' of the crypto space

Irish bank, not surprised.

If bitcoin is gold ? Will litecoin be silver ? And Doge bronze ? :P

Interesting prospect, probably why something like gold will not lose all it's value and ever be completely replaced. Is there room for both the natively digital and physical store of wealth?
