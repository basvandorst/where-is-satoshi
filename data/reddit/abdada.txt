Limo not Lambo.
Back in the 90s I decided to flip the script on the fancy cars bullshit that all my friends were getting.
Instead of buying a $75,000 luxury car, I bought a $2500 used Toyota Corolla.  No power windows or air conditioning or anything.
Then, I hired a local high school drop out to drive me around in it.  Think I paid him $8 an hour, maybe it was $6.50.  20 hours a week was cheaper than the car payment on the Audi.
If I went out on a date?  Private driver.  If my girlfriend wanted to go to the grocery store?  He took her.  If it was raining or snowing?  He had the umbrella.
The future is private hires of those who are poor with only fiat.  Let your friends bow to your balance and drive you around so they have something to do.

I've been here since 2012 and I've been telling people to do the same thing since then that I've been doing:  
* Purchase an affordable amount every week or paycheck
* Don't look at price
* Don't sell if your outlook is 10-20 years
* Ignore the morons on this sub
I bought $100-$150 every week since late 2012. I didn't look at the price.  Every 6-12 months if my bitcoin wealth was too much, I did liquidate to balance my portfolio so that bitcoin was never more than 12% of my net worth (and preferably 6%).
Did I sell and throw away millions?  Probably, but who cares, I still acquired assets using the cash.
I still buy $100-$150 a week, every week.  I still ignore the price.  If it's up, I get less bitcoin that week.  If it's down, I get more.  I don't care.
But, **I am thankful for people like OP** because emotional buyer-sellers who buy more than they can afford actually help us patient buyers who don't invest emotionally. 
I don't value relationships more than money or vice versa though.  I value my future and sanity the most.
You sound like you have a ton of things going on in your life that need more control.  Don't blame it on growing up poor, my parents came to the US on a boat and mom didn't speak English until I was 5 and both still have thick accents. We were poor but I still learned to be patient and productive.

Who knows?
In 10 years, encryption may fail and something new will have to come out.  Maybe bitcoin will adapt, maybe it won't.  Maybe it won't even be 3 coins but 70,000 coins with lots and lots of exchanges?
Maybe Walmart employees will be paid with Walmart coin and Walmart will stop taking cash and credit cards, so the employees will exchange Walmart coin for ShellGasCoin and AmazonCoin and KrogersCoin?  Maybe the entire idea of independent public blockchains will die because private blockchains will take over.
Nobody knows.
This is why I suggest doing the following:
* Stop spending on bullshit like video games, netflix, expensive sneakers, fast food
* Put all your excess income into a basket of goods, like:
* 7% crypto
* 6% liquid savings, high yield
* 6% CD ladder
* 25% stocks
* 25% bullion
* 25% real estate or REIT dividend yielding vehicles
And stop worrying about how much you didn't make when the last 10 years of your life were about buying throwaway bullshit that made assholes like me rich.
If you stop spending money on useless crap, what you invest in doesn't matter.
Here's a question:
Would you rather have $10,000 in bitcoin today be worth $5000 next year or would you rather spend $10,000 on plastic throwaway toys today and have them all worth $0 in 3 months?
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:35:23

Wow, you really have not invested much for very long have you?
Past performance is never an indicator of future performance.  Ever.
It's not a question of anything, because nobody can assume that their starting value matches a graph's starting value.  My bitcoin purchases started in 2012, and I bought weekly, so my valuation is different than some guy who bought $50 worth of bitcoin 3 weeks ago and that's all he has.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:12:06
Both are profitable.  I shorted BTC twice in the past 3 years and did well on that.  I short USD by purchasing BTC sometimes and did well there.

The problem with this is the IRS doesn't consider time vectors so anyone time traveling to invest would find they owe taxes in both directions and you'd end up paying almost all your earnings.

With investments, it always makes sense to have your bases covered.  I do the same with Schwab stocks and ETFs -- I don't trade with the money I just earned, I trade with my 5% balance in cash in the money market.  So 5% is in cash, 95% is in stocks, and I transfer cash each pay period into the money market but transact new trades out of the cash balance already there.
No different with how I manage CDs, bitcoin purchases, etc.  I don't buy any asset with "oh my god I have $5 to spend I might as well buy something with it immediately!!!"

In the short run, it isn't pretty.
Most people live in consumer mode because of inflationary currency being devalued so it makes sense for them to buy comic books and football jerseys versus parking it for 0.01% APY in savings.
Attempting to retrain consumer minds to hoard currency (bitcoin) will take more than half a generation.  So the initial stages of crypto will likely be the 3 non-hoarding groups all pushing balances in the hands of 1 group who inherently knows that supply is limited so get it while it's cheap and don't throw it away or spend it.
I say it will take at least 2 decades for people to switch from consume-at-any-cost to delay-gratification-until-need-is-reached point.  Maybe 4 decades.
Plus, how many jobs rely on consumer madness?  Most do.  Those jobs would go away in a hoarding economy to be replaced by what?  More housewives/househusbands?  How do you untrain folks who think their only option is to get the best job possible?
You have a lot of folks here saying "HODL" but click their usernames and you see them still wasting money on drugs or video games instead of buying more at a ridiculously cheap price.  Those folks are going to get kicked in the balls no different than the ones who aren't buying at all.

That's not the disclosure that any accountant lobbyist in DC has provided at all.  If you're using the so-called specific-share identification cost base for property gains, coinbase won't work for that because it isn't auditable as specific shares within your owned assets.
If you aren't doing specific shares, the regulations mandate picking FIFO or LIFO.  I pay good money to two lobbyists in DC for this purpose mostly (and some REIT dividend yield valuation tax code changes) and both agree not to do specific share valuation unless you can track actual transactions accurately.

Demands from clients don't mean shit if they're not profitable.
It's a great marketing tactic for Robinhood but others don't need to even TRY to compete on the same level until we see how Robinhood pays for this in time.
Yes, it will add competitive pressures in the minds of consumers, but if Robinhood can't make it profitable, it's going to sink.  You can't just start raising fees out of nowhere and assume to keep the clients you took from others.

Yep correct!
And yes there are correlations you can find, but if you remove the currency you're comparing to, all of those correlations are bullshit.
People on this sub are the most retarded bitcoin traders ever -- I only come here to find people who should be on the private bitcoin subreddit, lol.  Nobody on that one cares what the USD price is versus BTC because we track so many other currency comparisons.
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:29:31
Nah, it references bitcoin so I think it's good news actually.
Why anyone would use bitcoin to support this festering pit of dorito chair hell is beyond me.  I wish we could use bitcoin to shut reddit down, lol.
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:03:47
The correlation is just pattern matching.   There is no correlation because you can't strictly base bitcoin's valuation on one fiat currency comparison.
Change it from USD to something else and you see it all falls apart.

Trust me, we weren't always this sharp.  It's only been a year that I've been in the t-shirt game, and I screwed up a lot of orders.  Probably 40 orders last year (a tiny percentage overall, but all my fault personally).
I put my name on the site not just for ego, but also so I can bond with my customers.  I now have actual friends (real life now!) that I've met through the site, and one of my recent hires was a young gun customer who asked if he could help out and learn the trade.
I'm sick of buying from anonymous people online, but I still love bitcoin.  I want to prove that you can have real relationships with your customers, even if you're a continent away.
In 2 weeks, we're going to start up our live video channel on youtube, and we will inform you when your shirts are printing so you can watch it happen in real-time.  Another way to connect everyone in the process!
Thanks for your kind words.  If we did a great job, it wasn't me, it was my staff.  And if there was a failure, that was specifically all my fault 100%.

It's a no-brainer spreadsheet.  Even tells me what my "break even" price would have to be.

You have to be a real dumb fuck to be losing on bitcoin because as long as you DCA every week, you are up over ANY period of time practically.  Yes, if you started in December or whenver it was $19K, you might still be down a little bit, but not a lot, because DCA smooths volatility out.
I help guide about 300 people on doing bitcoin DCA and zero of them are down.  Zero.

This business is a job training facility more than anything else.  All of my hires are people who happened to be in the right place at the right time.  They'd show up, hang out, help out a little, and then I'd hire them when we get swamped.

All my employees in 25+ years of entrepreneurship are told 2 things:
1. You will earn what YOU earn, not from me, but from the customers you connect with.
2. If you are still working for me instead of competing with me in 2 years, you fail.
I will help any employee strike out on their own in their own business -- the same market they're in now, or a completely different one.
I have failed so many times it isn't funny, but the successes are always due to the connection I make with my staff, with my suppliers, and with my customers.

Was the order from 7bucktees or Coinsmiths?  Seriously, because these are two separate businesses.  One of them is "7bucktees by AB Dada" which is a company I have owned myself from day 1.
Coinsmiths was a partnership that I took over completely.
Let me know the order number and I will fix this.  I know there are still ~25 Coinsmiths orders from Christmas (out of 600?) that are MIA but I have no idea which ones.  I bought coinsmiths out 100% in March 2014, and I've been going through orders by hand to try to figure out who is missing.
You can email me personally at adam.dada+7bucktees or adam.dada+coinsmiths depending on which business it is.  Either of these gets past my public filters.

The Canvas 3001 white ink option is a great ringspun shirt.
The key for me was that I wanted to be cheap AND make money.  Some of my shirts sell for $5 -- that's a shirt, ink, printing, labor, etc.
But any of the white ink shirts are already a high quality t-shirt, and still pretty reasonable.

Sounds like a plan.  I am a full owner of 7bucktees but I am only a small minority owner of the site in question.  Unfortunately, I've parted ways with the old owners, and took on the entire site myself.  We are still finding lost orders from Christmas that the previous fulfillment shop didn't do.  It's annoying, because I focus on one-on-one relationships with all my customers, but the old shop didn't do jack properly.
Lesson learned, though.  Always a new lesson in this game.

I'm sure that's the case, but for me I prefer to just say thanks.  I don't want to run a business where I can't take ten seconds to show my appreciation.
If we get too big for me to say thanks personally, I'll let my top employee have some funds to run his own shop -- and I'll send him customers, happily.

I've been discussing setting up a Chicago bar (friends with the owner) with a custom written app that builds and releases tabs and tips.
Downside is that it won't integrate with their in-house system, but shouldn't be hard to have coexist.
The system is easy with the blockchain API or BitPay API since you're just requesting a new wallet address for each new tab.

Not sure who you are or what you order # is.  Post the order # here and I can look it up.
Generally speaking, the way I fix order errors is to go into the shop, which I do about every week or two, and just hand over cash and have the order restarted if there is a problem.  I also generally pay a lot extra (again, out of my personal pocket) to have a store credit issued to you in an amount greater than your original order.
Out of 16,000 orders in the past year or so, we've had issues with around 1%.  Usually something simple: printed on the wrong side, or the wrong size was sent.  Of those 160 or so orders that went bad, I'd say 40-50 had really pissed people on the other end.
Then again, I put my name up on the site specifically for this reason.  As far as I know, most other print shops online are anonymous at best -- no one has their name on it.
I'm sorry if I dropped the ball, but I do get a lot of emails.  Tons and tons a day, and most of the time they just end up outside of what Gmail thinks is "Important".  I try to spend a day a month going through other emails, but I don't always get there.
Now that it's summer, I get even more emails since I tend to give away hundreds of shirts a month (out of my pocket).  Rarely do I get negative emails, but I am generally very quick to address them.
In August, we are installing some helpdesk software to help address issues instantly.  Sending emails to me when I am out of town or out of the country on a weekly basis isn't working anymore.  I love the guys who run the shop, but they're students not corporation managers.  Most of them don't have high school degrees -- they just print shirts and their email service is pretty horrible.

I don't contribute much to miner income because my tx sizes aren't gigantic.  People who do a lot of small transfers in and out of their wallets end up with these incredibly sized txs which naturally cost more to add to a block.
I keep my txs consistently big when I want to transfer funds.  I don't use bitcoin to pay for small purchases of under $2000 -- just like I don't use gold to pay for a Whopper.

I'm fine with fees adjusting to supply and demand.  Right now, mining is a race for block rewards.  I believe the market and profit-driven individuals and companies will find a way to be competitive without adjusting the block size.
Offchain transactions might happen for those who want tiny transactions with small to no fees.  The risk there is higher for those individuals but if you want something cheap, you should carry the risk.  The miners don't need a doubling or more of storage requirements so that you cheapskates can avoid the market driven fees.
I don't mine because I'm happy to pay the market rate for getting my transaction cleared quickly.  If you don't care about speed, pay a lower fee and be patient.  If you need speed, it's supply and demand driven.
If you want zero to low fees for tiny transactions, offchain settlements will probably happen through huge exchanges who will work out settlements themselves internally.
We don't need a bigger block size.  We don't need SegWit.  All we need is to let the market do what it does best.
I'll pay even higher fees than now if it means it encourages bright individuals to find ways to make a better product organically.

I owned small businesses over that time in a variety of markets.  Most of my businesses lasted around 4-6 years before I sold them or changed markets.  Some were profitable (maybe 2 out of 7) some lost money (probably 3 out of 7) and some broke even with mediocre pay (2 out of 7).
I also bought a condo at 17 for cash and still own it today and still rent it out and it pays excellent profits.
My goal was diversification of income -- I never wanted to make more than $30,000-$40,000 per year income in any one business line so I didn't feel bad about walking away.  I never made huge money, but investing 30-40% of my income annually means I never have to work again.
Save more than you spend (40% of income in savings isn't difficult), diversify what you save (I have 6 different investment markets), learn to live on less than your broke idiot lazy fat friends do.

Bitcoin will replace Western Union when companies come up to do that.
Western Union, if you aren't aware, isn't a currency.  It's a third party that uses currencies.  Right now, Western Union uses their own network that is instantaneous, safe and works all over the world.  Bitcoin needs third party support, but because it's so immature, it isn't getting as much support as is needed for it to be ubiquitous. 
The thing is, I use Bitcoin ALL THE TIME with third parties to avoid transaction issues.  For example: I always try to keep some BTC value in Gyft so I can instantly buy gift cards if needed.  I bought a travel gift card onboard a cruise ship in a foreign country recently using BTC and it was instant and perfectly timed.  
Third parties is what makes bitcoin usable.  Being your own bank is a retarded idea because banking isn't just about securing commodities and being able to transfer them quickly and cheaply.  There's more to it than that.
Bitcoin will mature in time, and I don't think it will require much change to the code to do it.  It will just take trusted feedback in markets.

I'm not saying that at all.  I *am* saying that people who can't manage the immaturity of early adoption shouldn't be bitching about it because their inputs don't add up to much.  I've been an early adopter in many technologies and have made a lot of money on some and lost my ass on others, but I can afford the risk and hope for the reward.  Others who can't afford the risk shouldn't be involved.  They're the reason why some markets get regulated -- because unworthy investors scream foul to regulators.


Most of them are more inflationary in some ways, or less capable in other ways.  Bitcoin currently works great, but it isn't perfect, because it's an immature market and an immature product.  That's why I am happy to buy weekly and hold long term -- I have faith that the market will resolve these issues.


And what a lot of poor blokes are screaming for is regulation rather than market solutions.
Forcing miners to mine against their best profit judgment is the equivalent to regulation.  Forcing/demanding SegWit or LN or BU or whatever is a ridiculous protest point.  If miners can make money on them, they will adopt them once its proven.  If they can't, they won't adopt them.

Nah, I retired because I didn't know why I was working. I'm not rich by any large measure, but I can't figure out why all my peers and colleagues work at all.  It makes no sense to me -- giving up all my sunlight every week to do what?  Buy a bigger house?  My house is 800 square feet and perfect.  Buy a nicer car?  I sold my car 4 years ago and will never drive again because Uber/rideshare is cheaper than owning a car.  Buy a bigger TV?  I don't own a TV or the cable bill and it saves me around $4000 a year or so.
All of the shit we "buy" is mostly useless.  On top of that, 60% of my income goes to government at some point, so only 40% is left for me, and of that 40%, 80% of that is garbage I don't need.

Over many years my value always goes up.
In nearly 25 years I have never once had a year where my investment portfolio didn't grow.  Ever.  I use a modification of Harry Browne's "Permanent Portfolio" and adjust my holdings based on that.  Bullion, cash, rental properties, stocks, bonds, crypto.  
Every January I rebalance my holdings to a certain percentage range.  Bitcoin has really been tough because I always have to sell some every year since it ends up too heavy in my portfolio balance.  Just $100 a week, every week, and I don't try to time markets.

And 9 out of 10 truck drivers are corporate employees -- replacing a manual cab with an autonomous cab can have savings to the tune of $40,000 in the first year based on salary + benefits alone.  The cost of replacing a cab back in 2015 when I checked was around $120,000 for a large fleet owner -- based on gross savings alone you're looking at a 3 year payoff. 
On top of that, based on the information I've collected in the recent 6 years I've closely tracked the autonomous vehicle industry, there is an advantaged savings on both fuel economy AND productivity as autonomous trucks can drive 24 hours without legal restrictions on down time, and drive at a more efficient fuel economy.  Peloton says a 7% savings is in the bank already and there are likely savings up to 10-15% if platooning.
On top of that, autonomous trucks within the same fleet can be driven as a platoon (something human drivers are usually against, especially union drivers) which can have savings in both fuel economy and labor costs.
Read Roland Berger's "Automated Trucks" article from last year or the year before last.  Dr. Wolfgang Bernhart and Dr. Walter Rentzsch both contributed to the data and have their own public opinions on it, but because I am invested in autonomous vehicles (and have been for 7+ years) I also get insider newsletters and reports that portray an even shorter term replacement period than they're publicly disclosing.
Jerry Kaplan of Stanford is saying the autonomous truck replacement could happen in 10 years but he's also on record saying that might actually be too long as technology shows profitability in the trade sooner.
I've researched this deeply and have even been paid for my opinion on it -- autonomous vehicles are going to crater the lower 2 castes of the US and parts of Europe, not to mention China, India and Australia.

I follow the Harry Browne "permanent portfolio" adapted to 2017 instead of 1995, lol.
My assets are simple:
* Bullion (physical) - 16%
* Cash (physical/bank) - 16%
* Stock - 16%
* Bonds - 16%
* Property (cash flow positive) - 16-24%
* Crypto - 8-16%
* Other - 4-12%
I rebalance my portfolio around 1-2 times a year to try to get it even but sometimes it's difficult because property isn't liquid and hard to value well.
Harry Browne's modified Permanent Portfolio means I have never had a year where my net worth dropped as compared to equal holdings the prior year.  I also grew my portfolio every year with additional income/profits straight into savings.

Used Coinbase as a merchant service provider for my online stores for years.  Never had an issue.  None of my customers buying $10-30 orders had issues.
I promote Coinbase on Facebook like crazy to newbs with zero knowledge of BTC.  None of them have had issues in the years I've promoted them.  Zero issues.

You're confused.
Monetary deflation (a restricted supply of money) drives price deflation as suppliers of goods and services compete to attract money that savers don't want to spend.
Deflation and inflation are monetary in nature.  Price changes are side effects to supply and demand changing based on the changing supply of money and the demand for goods and services.

As I've said on Reddit many times, anyone can become a millionaire young if they wanted it -- and it doesn't require riskier investments.
It's legal to work full-time at 15 in many states -- when you have no rent to pay, no overhead or bills but maybe a cell phone (and that can be just $45 a month).  So if you're working 40 hours a week from age 15, you're looking at $20,000 free and clear per year just doing basic retail.  Build a talent for selling and that number will grow as you negotiate better pay and commissions.  By 18, there is no excuse for someone to not have $75,000 in the bank.
At 18, you are out of the bullshit uselessness of high school and can now have a full time job and a part-time job working 60-70 hours a week -- while still living with your parents.  Now you're talking about $50,000 a year and by the time your idiot friends graduate with a useless college degree and $100,000 in debt, you've got $275,000 in the bank to buy a 3-flat or 4-flat to rent out to those idiot friends who now have to rent because they can't afford to buy.
By 25, you've got your $275,000 rental asset and just between your jobs and rental income, you've got another $350,000 in the bank.  25 years old and you're already at a net worth of $625,000 with very little real risk, a ton of knowledge, and the ability to expand your empire.
There is zero reason a person aged 30 shouldn't be worth a million net unless they made the foolish decision to go to college, get a useless degree, and slog in a cubicle their entire youth.
Morons have zero net worth at 30.  Smart hard workers are millionaires by 30, 31.  Just by working a sales job and having smarts about savings.

Yep and if you want a fast transaction, you're free to pay the right fee.  All my BTC transactions recently have had proper fees, and all of them confirm in 1-2 blocks.
This is actually what will cause consensus for a large block -- as fees grow, miners will switch support to maximize profit.  Right now, 1BTC average fee per block isn't enough, but 1.5-2BTC might be.

BTC becomes more and more valuable against WU when actual vendors accept it.  Or as actual third parties institute payment systems for popular vendors.

Weird things like that -- people said "that's crazy, no one will use it, it's too difficult, it doesn't work right, etc, etc, etc" and now they can't invest like I did.

Noob advice: you don't understand risk.  Don't invest if you don't understand risk.
Asking people for advice about investments means many of us will give you the opposite advice of what we want to see happen.  If you buy when we buy, we both add demand to raise prices.

Wrong.  The price of BTC in USD has no real effect on the actual fee.
Fee is based on supply and demand for mining.  After difficulty goes up, some miners quit which causes supply to drop which causes fees to go up.

Communist, capitalist, socialist, Marxist, libertarian -- none of these things matter.  That's for the monkeys at the bottom to believe and support.
In ALL government styles, the top 20% control what is important.  Read Pareto's book(s) from the late 1800/early 1900s.  Pareto showed the style of government does not matter, all that matters is the top 20.
Ethereum "next month" has been all that ethereum has had for 2 years.  It's always "next month" but the price never budges.
If Ethereum was actually going to do something, the insiders would be buying it up to resell after the pump.  No one is buying ethereum, it's volume is wasting away, and it is left to autistic circlejerking about "next month".

Yeah you need to set payment milestones next time.  I always required 30-50% up front and then milestones alone the way.
My contracts had HEAVY penalties if they missed a milestone by 1 hour or more.  I even said "by noon on such date with 1 hour leeway for payment to be verified."
If the payment was late more than a few days, any NDA was null and void and my work performed up to then was my property.

I also have some insider scoop from people at my bank and a bankruptcy attorney I know.  Once in a blue moon I'll get a lead on a great opportunity.
I helped a guy I met through Reddit a few years ago and befriended snag a beautiful rehab for around $200,000 below market because the seller had to sell, for cash, and close in 48 hours with no inspection or disclosures.  He rehabbed it over the past year or so and is renting it out for positive cash flow even with his extensive rehab costs and shit.
He figures he'll pay himself back in 9 years, which is an awesome scoop.  I wish I had the funds to do it myself.

It's a luxury that won't make sense for most people because of its efficiency.
I dumped my car in 2013.  I took Uber or rideshare over 6000 times averaging $12 a ride.
My tax accountant says I paid $72,000 total but owning a car would have cost me around $55,000 in the same time, and the 12,000 minutes I was in a ride I probably made over $15,000 income handling work while being driven.
This doesn't include time to find parking, car washes, time wasted removing snow or on wasted rides I didn't have to do but did because I had a car and figured fuck it.
It also didn't cover the real tax incentives for writing off the rides perfectly as business related when they were (different logins for work and pleasure rideshare).
Overall my net savings was a realized $9000 or so.  And it was accelerated savings once UberPool sharing came into the market in 2015 or so.
Most people will save double that once labor portion of the rideshare falls to $0. It won't make sense to own when rideshare will be 80-90% cheaper than owning and operating and maintaining a car.
Mark my words and remember this post.  2022 will be the year of autonomous cars destroying an outdated industry.  And cratering public train and bus usage too.

Have you gone to any preforeclosure auctions in your area?  I'm not well versed with DC at all -- I know 2 young guys who bought multiunits in the past 10 years and are doing really well on them (ROI was positive after rehab) but they also bought with cash 100% and lowballed offers until they got a desperate bagholder.

No it doesn't give you a voice.
The white paper says who gets a voice: those who take a risk to mine.
If you don't mine Bitcoin, you have zero voice.  That's by design.  Bitcoin balance holders aren't given a voice because they're not committed to maintaining the blockchain whatsoever.
500 Bitcoin or 0.05 Bitcoin has the same voice: zero.
Even mining with a single ASIC gives you some voice.  A whisper, but louder than the mute.
The only voice you have is to be the loudest user who pays the highest fee for a transaction.  That's a one time voice per transaction.

For every $1 a person in the US earns, about 60% of it is lost to taxes at some level.  That leaves 40%.
Of the remaining 40% people are allowed to keep, around 80-90% of that is spent on either debt for useless consumption, or further useless consumption.  In this I include the overly large house, the stupid vehicle costs, etc. 
So for most people, for every $1 you earn, less than $0.04-$0.08 is actually for you to save or use for future benefits.

Bitcoin is just one small portion of my portfolio.  I only buy $100-$150 a week, but have for many years so my Bitcoin always needed to be sold off to rebalance my portfolio overall.  Right now I still buy $100-$150 a week (which is what I also buy in bullion and in stocks and in a few bonds -- I also put that much aside for increasing real estate holdings).

I had cable 10 years ago.  I still have my bank statements from then and I was paying $130 a month for cable for sure, plus $10 or so a month for Netflix, plus I had a video game system I rarely played but would always pick up the latest game to have around for parties, plus I had a new fancy TV every 2-3 years (they were $1500 back then or so) plus I had a nice sound system and would want a DVD player or a Blu-Ray player or a Blu-Ray Super Mega HD player or a new subwoofer for movie watching or whatever.
Even 10 years ago, it was probably $2500 a year or more.  With inflation, it's probably way higher today.  I have no idea.
That also doesn't include the fact that out of the last 250 guys who came to me for mentorship advice, the AVERAGE guy spent 1000 hours a year consuming digital content on TV -- even with a shitty part time mall job, that's $10,000-$15,000 a year of productivity thrown away to make some rapper or movie star richer.  That's average -- some guys are spending 3000 hours a fucking year consuming digital content (video games included).  I am trying to close on another investment condo right now that will go for $45,000 only and rent out for $850 a month -- if you blow 3000 hours a fucking year consuming digital content, you could afford an investment condo in 2 years with a shitty part time mall job.
That $850 a month means about $550 a month profit with almost no work -- $6600 a year of income with maybe 5-10 hours a year of actual work (on average) for doing nothing but NOT watching some boobs on TV and having put that time to productive work AND not spending money on useless consumption.

1. Don't make huge purchases.  Take every balance you have to buy and divide it up over 10-20 weeks.  If you have $250, just buy $15 a week for 10-12 weeks.
2. Buying in little bits every week since I started has been amazing.  I've even looked at what would happen if I started later, and it still works great.
3. I wish I had bumped up my tiny weekly autobuy purchases by $50 more a week, lol.

The users are an expected side effect.  In the case of a crypto that has fought off the demands of cheapskates, it only makes the crypto that much valuable for the few users who actually matter.

I did a few times in the past and morons from Reddit and Facebook got the suppliers to shut it down entirely.
Last year I spent a lot of time and money trying to set up a decent export solution through a Chinese vendor who is well reputed by US chemical houses, and they shut it down towards year's end when I shared them with a few people and those people shared them with others and the other people just wasted the company's time.
Aroma volatile compounds are extremely sensitive to packing and extremely potent.  You don't need much.  For a packing house to sell 5g amounts isn't profitable at all -- it can cost $10 in labor just to dispense and pack volatiles worth only $10 plus the bottle and fulfillment costs, so you get 5g of volatiles for $30 when a 50g bottle is already $30.
No one would ever need 50g of most pure volatiles.
I'm still working to find a way to do this but unfortunately the numbers don't work at the small amounts DIY mixers are playing with.  Since the shelf life of pure volatiles is way way shorter than concentrates, I don't know if there IS a solution.
TFA sells some direct, but not the ones most people want.

1 car can handle anywhere from 12 to 40 riders a day.  That means cost of travel will drop as much as 90% in some cases.
Instead of $600 a month in insurance and gas and maintenance and car payments, it could be as little as $60.  And the riders can put the ride time to productive needs.

If you lose it, you still have ways to recover the wallet.
All a hardware wallet does is make accessing the private keys easier than having a PC or an app.  PC/app can be hacked.  Airgapped PCs are tougher, but then you need to airgap it.

Because bitcoin is highly volatile.  Buying little bits over time reduces volatility.

I buy and sell gold in a variety of currencies depending on the tax jurisdiction of the asset and which investment vehicle of mine I am using.  For example: a trust that I am a beneficiary of holds gold outside of the US and I pay more attention to pricing in that currency as liquidity is a concern in that tax jurisdiction so even though the spot price of gold in US is one value, in that area it is way more valuable due to low supply and extremely high demand.
Same with bitcoin.  What markets say isn't as valuable as I also offer bitcoin for purchase in tight demand markets -- I can sometimes get 30-40% over current value if demand is high enough.  I also offer to buy bitcoin for cash from people who are time restricted desperate.
If the USD price of bitcoin goes down but the exact same moment the CNY price goes up, people who transact in CNY may sell and the USD price does not matter to them at all.

Miners serve the miners' pleasure. They mine for reward + fees.  Users give Bitcoin value because the miners mine.  Bitcoin without miners is useless.  Bitcoin will always have users (the miners themselves) and the viable uniqueness of solid currency (per Rothbard et.al) so it will always attract users unless it makes a fatal error like that useless piece of shit Ethereum made.
If you want user power, go to Ethereum...  Like any statist, you can't force Bitcoin to be fair.  You statists fucked up enough already, go away.

I got screwed once when I was 19.  Even worse, they sued me for $700 for my prior check and I had to pay because a defense lawyer would cost more.
15 years later, I was consulting for a client who was picking a company to work with worth probably $2 million in contracts.  They submitted a bid and actually met me at the bid review meeting.
I told them and my client, point blank, that I was financially raped and molested by the company and have evidence to commit into the bid profile for future review.  They lost the bid, threatened me with a defamation lawsuit, and my corporate attorney responded that we would be happy to submit my saved evidence on the claims and make sure they're in the public record.
Since that failed bid of theirs, I've heard that a few other big customers heard of how they fucked me and have turned them down as well.  In reality it hasn't hurt them (much) but the best revenge is living well.  That guy still screws over young dudes to this day, so he has his own demons to live with, lol.

I totally agree, but to make demands is ridiculous.  What someone needs to do is write up exactly WHY miners would benefit from any of the advocated "solutions" using actual math and economics rather than pipe dream "it will just be better" statements.


My theory is that third parties will manage a workaround WITHOUT SegWit or HF increase.  Imagine if Coinbase and Gemini and BitPay all said "We will handle settlements offchain every hour so you can pay no fee whatsoever".  Yes, most anonymous users of bitcoin who "want to be their own bank" will puke on this idea, but *this is why banks existed in the bullion days*.  Transacting gold or silver sucked, so people used banks to do it and got receipts out of it.
I think there are solutions TODAY that could reduce fees significantly for those who are accepting some loss of freedom and self management.  And the rest can compete with the big players as any market requires.
The idea that "if you don't control it it isn't yours" is true, but it's also limiting.

SegWit doesn't make a lot of sense to me yet because I don't see how it resolves the issues people think it will resolve.  Malleability isn't resolved because SegWit transactions must only include SegWit spend inputs to overcome malleability issues.  That's making some big assumptions.
SegWit might help encourage LN but doesn't mean LN can't exist without it and third parties can incorporate offchain payments with onchain settlements today if they wanted to.  
Payment networks don't bother me because they can actually be a competitive market in lieu of an overly regulated one.  I'd use a payment network as a consumer for a small fee if it allowed for refunds via an arbitration agent, let's say.

Imagine being Coinbase or Gemini or any for-profit bitcoin company.  How much of their service costs in realized labor expenses are spent dealing with the absolute lowest fruit?

Do not assume that cheap fucks will make bitcoin more valuable.  If anything, removing them naturally from the market could have huge benefits for the large scale users of bitcoin who will not be burdened with the useless circlejerking over forcing miners to lower profits with magical code changes.
If the majority of users complaining about block fees would just disappear, bitcoin might actually be better suited for top tier investors and users -- which could have an amazing effect on price performance.

My dad's from India and I visit there once a year.
70% of India's economy has always been black market money.  The government's got zero option to fix that, it will only get worse.
My last visit to India, almost every transaction I made was in US dollars.  Good luck controlling that.

Price is merely the point in time where supply meets demand.
Since everyone buys at a different point in time, we all have different interests.
Some people short bitcoin and would be hurt by $10,000.
If bitcoin ever goes to $10,000, you have to look at what else changed in price.  Bitcoin at $1000 and gas at $3 a gallon means if bitcoin is $10,000 and gas is $50 per gallon that bitcoin did NOT keep up with inflation.

It won't change anything because SegWit will never happen.
Poor people who are likely to sell off their meager holdings at the first sign of a short term dump are horrible fiduciary hosts.  We can not trust these people to make responsible decisions, and SegWit is a horrible decision.
Miners have skin the game, taking big risks to try to make a meager profit.  It is in their interest to maintain Bitcoin's price so their mining rewards and block fees are valuable, but it is also in their interest to not destroy Bitcoin by pandering to non-voters (meaning, non-miners).
Non-voters do not matter in Bitcoin.  Satoshi said who gets a vote, and it's miners, and miners alone.
SegWit will never get enough support from miners because the risks of SegWit are known and unknown.  So there's not much to discuss because the majority of miners already understand how risky SegWit would be, and they're the ones who actually put real money up every day to protect the blockchain.
Bitcoin will find a resolution to the blockchain spammers, and it will come over time, maybe over years.  Poor people who can't afford settlement tx fees still have the option to buy and hold and by the time the entire Bitcoin community agrees on a solution, their Bitcoin will be incredibly valuable.
We're still in the earliest stages of infancy here.  Don't be like Ethereum where you throw all the work away for the poor masses trying to make decisions.

Even though it hurts me, I do believe that a basic living income is going to happen, regardless of political party in power.   I've run the numbers personally and think it's the only likely situation.
20-40% of people living in any cosmopolitan culture aren't just useless in the market, but they're fucking leeches.  Think of all the useless bureaucrats hired at the DMV or whatever -- remove these people from the labor force, give them their shekels to pay for cable and food and sneakers, and you'll be MORE productive at your work.

I also own the tiniest house in my area and don't own a car or TV or computer or any such shit so that I can put my money where my mouth is and take risks my friends will never take so that they can have ugly McMansions and useless BMWs.
The network doesn't need to expand until it needs to expand.  That's how markets work.  Once a profit can be found, someone will make it happen.  Maybe miners, maybe a third party offchain developer, maybe some new technology we never considered.
Maybe miners will quit because of reduced block rewards which will bring more balance to home miners.  Who knows?
I would be surprised if in 10 years we still have professional miners.  Honestly, I can see it returning back to small mining rigs at home because the rewards aren't as valuable as they used to be when based on fees alone.

This is a question that scares me because it's asked every hour and it shines a spotlight that you do not understand investing, risk, and reward options.
When people come to bitcoin expecting to strike it rich, but have no foundation in understanding investing, it makes me nervous because those are the people who will run to the senator demanding action when they have a short term loss.
 avoid investing in anything until you've read books on risk, markets, economics, rewards, etc.

The white paper is amoral.  It's market driven and the market is amoral.
It is your opinion (and mine) that mining is too expensive.  That's not the market's opinion or no one would mine.
But people do mine so the market is satisfied and I am satisfied paying higher fees to get to the head of the line.
This summer I will go to Six Flags 4-6 times.  I will pay about $1500 for those visits and that will boost me to the front of every line.  Other poor saps will pay $60 a visit and wait 2-3 hours for one ride, but they will get a ride.

I was a self made millionaire in my 20s (from growing up very poor) and lost it all around age 31.  Then I lived in a basement studio apartment (no bedroom) and didn't have enough money to pay for electricity for almost 5 months.  It taught me a lot because my actual quality of life didn't change much.  I actually dated MORE women than when I was rich and somewhat of a local celebrity.  Go figure.
So then I started to plot more and realized a lot of small changes lead to HUGE changes long term.
For example: my car (SUV) that I drove a lot was costing me around $20,000 a year.  I was in the car over 500 hours a year and that time was 100% unproductive.  So I fired my car, moved to near a transportation hub (bus, train, subway) and use Uber (6000 rides) and while being driven around, I was able to make calls that I billed for or reply to emails to take on rush jobs.
I downsized from 3500 square feet loft in the hot part of town to a 800 square foot house with 88" ceilings.  I paid cash for the house.  My cost of living is $0 because I also own a rental condo 1 mile away and the profits from that pay 100% of my insurance, property taxes and utility bills.  So my cost of living in my home is truly $0 per month (I've owned it since May 2015, never once had to put money into my home fund).
In the past 10 years, I've interviewed thousands of people like me, including some close friends, and realized that government took about 60% of my income (add all the various sales taxes, etc) and of the remaining 40%, rampant useless consumerism took another 30% or so (probably 35%).  So for every 100 hours I worked, only 5 hours were for living necessities.
Once I developed my budget better, including emergencies, etc, I realized I could live on $4000 a year if I absolutely had to.  And since retiring, I have been living on less than that thanks to having so much free time to find better deals.
I live now.  I spend time with my aged parents, my siblings, my close friends.  If my GF wants to spend an extra night at my place, I am with her, not with my work phone.  If I want to go on a vacation tomorrow, I can.
I will never work again because I want to live this one life, and I want to live it well.

SegWit can be tested just fine on other cryptos.  I have no issue with testing it out with cryptos that aren't already well supported in the market with growing support every day.
As for the known and unknown risks, just google **segwit pros and cons** and read up.  SegWit bothers me because I worry about fungibility.  I really worry that SegWit will split the economy up into those forced into a sidechain/offchain solution like LN and those who stick to the blockchain.
Many SegWit supporters say that SW actually increases fungibility but this is FUD.  SegWit feels too much like colored coins and that fiasco creates a less fungible bitcoin.

I'm part of the bitcoin as gold club, not the bitcoin as pennies.
Transaction fees are CURRENTLY high because bitcoin is immature and the market hasn't developed fully.  I do NOT look at bitcoin as a great solution right now, today, for most people.  I look at bitcoin as a great solution LONG TERM as the market matures.
Bitcoin is still growing in what it can do.  Right now what bitcoin does that almost no other investment vehicle can do is that it isn't hyperinflationary like any other currency.  Even gold is pseudoinflationary in some ways -- miners reduce mining when gold's price is low, but they know they can mine more when the price is high.  Bitcoin miners can not adjust their mining to mine more or less than the actual math allows overall.
So Bitcoin today is just a great long term investment vehicle to get in with the idea that the big risk is if the markets will find solutions to these issues.  I personally believe offchain settlements will fix bitcoin but this will mean...banks.  I have zero issues with banks themselves -- gold banks were real and you had to pay a fee to use them, unless you loaned your gold out for interest paid.  Bitcoin can be the same, and I'd have no issue with it -- let offchain banks settle between each other and guarantee payments, and let people loan bitcoin out to each other if they want to avoid paying a fee to banks for securing the balances.
People are demanding that they want to "be their own banks" but they don't want to pay fees for those that handle securing the blockchain?  Fuck them.  Useless people with short term views.
I buy US$100-US$150 a week in bitcoin.  If I spend bitcoin, I replace it.  I don't care about the fees right now because I think the long game is going to be very, very beautiful for early adopters.  I've been buying bitcoin since it was US$12 or so and will continue to buy weekly if it's US$5000 or US$400.  Doesn't matter to me.
Once the market succeeds at resolving these short term concerns, bitcoin will blossom.  If it fails, I lose my investment of $8000 a year or whatever.  No big deal for me.  Worth the risk.
@_date: 2017-02-16 01:09:49
Yes, private keys will continue to work on any change, if your wallet can apply signed transactions to a specific chain.

There's also a risk that you can transfer funds on one chain and accidentally do the same on another.

I want mining fees to go up so that the MARKET finds a solution to it.

Satoshi was smart in setting the 1MB limit.  Hosting the blockchain database is already HUGE, I can't imagine how big it will get at 8MB when everyone is sending Satoshi dice sized transactions again when fees drop to near zero again.

You can have a USD high and not have a CNY high.  Assuming people are selling off because it's approaching $1100 USD is wrong.  They might be selling off because it's approaching a CNY high or a PLN high or any other currency even if USD is ignored by them.

Exactly.  And worse than that, the least valuable people have a voice which means the voice has no value.

It was, and it still is, but with block rewards dropping more the miners need to find out how profits will be had long term, hence higher fees are necessary.


Well, I've been into Bitcoin since July 2012 and I was never an idealist.  I saw Bitcoin as a usable theory to replace part of my gold holdings and knew Bitcoin wouldn't always be an ideal currency for the poor or small transactions because I knew the block reward wouldn't live forever.


So what?  Bitcoin's usability for small purchases is awesome because it removes fiduciary control from the regulated centralized fiat users (banks, merchant processors, governments) but in exchange for removing that centralization you have to accept market forces at work.
On top of the merchant fees, what is lost to fiat inflation costs AND the costs to maintain fiat currencies in the form of regulator treatment of powerful parties?  When I still worked, I had to pay 60% of my income to government at every level, plus say 3.5% to merchant accounts. So if I wanted to buy something for $10, I had to actually earn $27.40.  Think about THAT when you bitch about bitcoin fees...
Bitcoin's "high" fees aren't high by any means, because you've got the power to be as regulated as you want to, as centralized as you want to.  The leeches no longer control how YOU spend your money, or save it, unless you want to hand over control.
@_date: 2017-02-08 17:43:20
Correct.  Either it confirms and the recipient gets payment, or it gets forgotten by the mempool and your client can resend it.

Except cash is less traceable, bitcoins are totally traceable, forever.

Why should the people merely using the system but not actually paying to install and maintain it get a vote?
The miners are the one bearing the heavy risks and costs to mine.  The users are given the option to pay a market-driven fee, or wait for long confirmation times.
If 500,000 Starbucks customers all wrote "$0.50 lattes" on their $5 bills, would it change what Starbucks charges, especially if 50,000 customers were happy to pay $5 and kept Starbucks busy?

Autonomous cars will replace driving for everyone but rural folks (at first) and people who absolutely have to have a truck for work.

History of what?
Did you know that 100% of government currencies over the past 2000 years all went bankrupt?  All of them?
Right now, the current iteration of the USD is only about 46 years old.  And its lost almost all of its value since then.  Not sure how you can say that no other currency has been as volatile because all of them have crated lower and lower versus commodities.  All of them.
Many currencies in the past 30 years have actually bankrupted entirely.
Bitcoin has only been around since 2009 but at this point it has shown a lot of stamina.  It can change, certainly, but I doubt it will go to $0.  I am risking 16% of my net worth on cryptos right now, but if it went to $0 I still have enough to live on for 3 lifetimes.

The miners paid for mining equipment and overhead priced in BTC not fiat.  That way they can compare if it makes more sense to mine or more sense to just buy and hold bitcoin.
So if the fiat price of BTC skyrockets, it doesn't mean better options for them -- it could even mean they would have done better just buying and holding bitcoin.
Stop assuming miners price things in fiat.  They price things in the currency of note, and if they end up with more at the end, or less.

I never bought property with a loan -- always just bought with cash I saved.  I don't like debt, and I don't find it advantageous because of how many people I know who were wiped out buying too much property at low interest rates.  I know a couple who had 10 properties paid off then bought 20 more and before the bubble popped entirely they were bankrupt with zero assets left.
If you work a job and have a part time job and some gig income, you can put $40,000 a year towards investment properties and rent them out quickly for cash income.  After 10 years of doing that you're debt free AND you have residual long term income.

The instant you click "buy" on Coinbase, they are buying the bitcoin for you.  They are giving you a loan against your bank transferring the funds which can take a few days for settlement.
Even after settlement, it can take a few weeks for the money to be confirmed for them -- if you used a hacked account, you get the bitcoin and they lose the transfer.  So it's important for them to make sure the money is really there.
At their relatively low margin (and zero maintenance fees), they have to protect their assets.

Everyone is different and has different needs for bitcoin.
From a purely investment position, all my Bitcoin are legit and disclosed for tax purposes.  I use Coinbase for autobuys weekly and I am just fine with their markup.
If I was buying drugs or hookers or weapons, I wouldn't buy on a legitimate exchange and the markup would be far less important.  If I was trying to deceive tax authorities in my jurisdictions, I wouldn't buy on an official regulated exchange.
My opinion is if you can't figure out if it's worth YOUR purposes for bitcoin, don't invest in bitcoin.
I don't know any wealthy people who buy on LBC except for drug users.  I don't know any drug users anymore.
If you can't get on a regulated exchange for investment purposes, you probably don't have enough money to invest in anything.

My bitcoin investment helped me retire at 42 -- it was just ONE part of it, but it was probably 15% of it.  I am thankful for getting into bitcoin early.
Now, my bitcoin investment is my only gamble.  All my other investments are safe, secure, liquid and well managed.  Bitcoin at 4-8% of my net worth is not enough to bankrupt me at all, but it's enough to be a veritable boon if bitcoin manages to sustain value growth over the next 10-20 years.
The thing is, I don't care about today.  I think it's unreasonable that bitcoin is at US$1000 already.  I think US$500 is more reasonable, maybe even US$300, but I still buy $100-$150 a week every week because it's not a lot of money.  It's still less than 8% of my monthly passive income.
Most morons in life blow $100 a week on booze and video games.  I don't do either.  Even if bitcoin loses 90% of value, my $100/week investment pays better than video games or booze does.

If bitcoin banks became more popular to handle small scale transactions of under $100 -- without fees or any transaction delay -- you could probably shunt 80% of bitcoin transactions off the chain entirely and only let the banks settle hourly or a few times a day to the blockchain.
You would be able to handle all the transactions society needs in well under 10MB blocks.

@_date: 2017-03-19 15:24:30
I agree with this, but I can't see people jumping to a competitor so easily.
I don't mine.  I used to sell products and services for Bitcoin and have since 2012.  I believe the miners have the power in consensus.  I also don't see myself switching to a different crypto even if the miners change the rules on me, because bitcoin has a ton of the so-called "network effect" and it works great as a payment method for large scale transfers.
On top of that, I can make cheap-to-free payments using Bitcoin offchain using a service like Coinbase if I wish.  This is great for small payments ($5, $50, whatever), is instantaneous and if the receiver wants to remove their balances received from Coinbase (offchain) they can pay a fee to transfer all those balances in aggregate back on-chain by paying the fee if they want to.
I don't need SegWit, I don't need BU, I don't need Core -- I just need the blockchain secured and I want to see MORE competitive off-chain settlement systems like Coinbase before I agree to changing the codebase to add other options like LN, SW, BU, etc.
The question is, why is Coinbase my only option for off-chain settlements?  I love Coinbase, it's easy, but I'd like to see competitive off-chain settlement banks for bitcoin.
No codebase change needed, right now.

Then I could post a link to a domain I own and send them a private message saying "hey jackchandelier, you said you can check out my snowboard here's a link" and you click it and now I have your IP address (possibly) and even be able to use that to look up your home address and other info based on private databases that analyze this shit.

If nodes were expensive to spin off, that would be true.  But since nodes are cheap and easy, I don't think nodes have much power.  They appear to have power now because we're still mining core as a community whole, but once there's a fork (soft or hard), I think miners will start running group nodes to reduce efficacy of individually-run nodes.

Correct, fiat matters in pricing the individual cryptocurrency but when it comes to mining, you can price it in fiat, or price it in BTC.  Pricing it in BTC is more common since miners earn BTC, not fiat.

It is a free market.  If 100% of people who were bitching about high fees would invest $10,000 in hardware and electricity, I bet they'd take over the majority of mining.
$10,000 gets you 65 TH/s.  To mine enough to equal current hash rate would require 50,000 new miners.  There are 200,000 redditors on this sub...
If just 25% of those here would mine at an initial outlay of $10,000, there'd be no problem.
But they're unwilling to put their money where their mouths are.

Read what I said again.  I earned free buying power.
At 18, in 1992, average pay in retail was $8 in Chicago.  Working two retail jobs for 60 hours a week is $480 a week.  Over four years, that's $100,000.  That's assuming no raises and no commissions.  If you're a guy working retail and selling, you negotiate raises and commissions or change employers.  So that's actually closer to $175,000 over 4 years.
Average 18 year old wastes those 4 years going to work for academia.  And pay for the privilege. Say $20,000 a year.
$250,000 of buying power thrown away from 18-21.

Bitcoin doesn't need to settle coffee purchases on the blockchain.  It can be handled just fine by the coffee company's offchain "bank" like Coinbase.  If you sell coffee, open a Coinbase vendor account and tell your customers they can either handle payment themselves and wait for confirmation, or they can have a small $100 coinbase account to get instant and immediate fee-free transfers to buy the coffee.
Other vendors LIKE Coinbase should appear, but regulatory hurdles to starting your own Bitcoin bank are excessive in cost and time.  Still, I'd like to see 10 Bitcoin banks that handle off-chain settlement for small $5 purchases.
The banks could even handle inter-bank settlements on-chain once a day/hour/whatever to keep fees reasonably small.
I like the idea of being my own bank for large transfers, but for small transfers I have no issue using a bank like Coinbase.  I don't keep much in Coinbase, a few grand maximum, nothing that will hurt me if Coinbase went belly up.

Banks won't.  Banks are optional for individuals to decide to use or ignore.
Anyone can pay high fees if they so desire.  Or they can work with offchain settlements companies if they so desire.
This has nothing to do with fiat which only empowers banks.  You can theoretically mail cash dollars by postal service but it isn't feasible like Bitcoin today where right now you can settle yourself with higher fees or let an offchain settlement company do it for a lower price.

That's a ridiculous statement.
Bitcoin allows you the option of being your own bank.  If you're willing to deal with security, insurance and fees, you can do it.  Bitcoin isn't free.  It was never meant to be free.  When millions or some day billions of people compete for scarce resources, prices go up.  And up. And up.
Third parties can offer aggregated value offerings.  They're not trying to monopolize the blockchain at all. They're providing a valued service.
You aren't restricted to Coinbase.  Use a private wallet for huge holds and use Coinbase for small transactions and tips and purchases.  You can do both without limits.
You can't do that with fiat* or gold.  You can't do it with any other form of currency.
Bitcoin lets you be your own bank, if you're willing to compete for block space.  You think 1MB sucks?  Wait until it's 128MB per block but each TX size is 9,000+ bytes lol.

It's true tho.  I'm not some cheap fuck who demands free txs.  I want market forces to work.  I don't want mining monopolies nor do I think end users have a voice if they aren't mining.
Bitcoin is young but it's working.  As long as we give it time, consensus will form.  Right now $1.50 fees don't scare me.  Hell, on a $500 visa charge the vendor is hiding up to $8 in fees in the price of goods.

@_date: 2017-03-15 03:27:59
It's not immaterial.  That's immature to state.
Miners defend the blockchain, nodes validate mining work.  Nodes can't force the issue as much as you think they can.

Millions of nodes don't.  They only validate the work proven by miners.

Not at all.  I think everyone should be free to provide off-chain settlement options.
Based on LN and SW theories posted over time, I don't believe SW and LN will work well for end users.  They think it will but they're just being cheap fucks rather than actually working through the theoretical outcomes.  LN will support large users who can afford to cover the middleman financials for payment channels.  SW will likely help miners who can spin off nodes in high quantities cheaper than any individual users can.
It all sounds great, but bitcoin was meant to be competitive and it will stay competitive.  End users won't be helped by any methods proposed.  The bitcoin bank solution will continue to be the cheapest and fasted method for end users.  Period.
Those who want to control their own wallets will always pay more than by using a bank.  Always.  That's the cost of self ownership.

On Lightning?  It depends on the time-value of locking up funds for a particular transaction.  See the LN paper and look at page 42:

Wrong.  Short term gain helps add liquidity to markets.  Short term gain means people move the pricing stick more frequently which means price is confirmed more often.

It's NOT a critical issue.  You're being emotional, impatient and not trusting in the evolution of extremely fucking detailed financial security.
Bitcoin is totally unique in our entire history of secured transactions on any platform for any reason.  It's not even a decade old and it's creating history with every step.
Now that it's worth BILLIONS with MILLIONS of users, the security of the blockchain is the  priority.  Nothing comes ahead of it.  Nothing.
Do you monitor GitHub daily?  I do.  I read it all.  Do you?  I doubt it.  If you did, you'd see the discussions and debates that go on ALL THE TIME about how to safely but properly expand Bitcoin's abilities.
Right now, developers and people with deep security engineering know-how can't find a modification that makes secure sense going forward.  They're working on it.
Impatient emotional people should not drive progress.  They should be silenced, in my opinion.  Emotional impatient people have ruined many great things in history because they are incapable of making logical and patient decisions.
Bitcoin is growing, daily.  That's because people are trusting it.  You're demanding we violate that trust so some cheap fucks can get a stable currency?

This is a weak question that worries me because it means people who aren't familiar with the risks of investing in anything are getting involved in bitcoin due to the recent highs.
Please don't put money into any investment at all until you've spent time understanding that no one knows the market, no one can tell you which way it will go, and if anyone gives you advice they may be biased wanting you to move a position opposite their own desires.
Go learn about investment risk first.  Stay out of bitcoin for now -- people who take stupid risks are the first ones to cry to their senators for regulations when they lose a huge amount of money they can't afford to lose.

But it isn't nonsense.  If you understand the miners' perspectives, you'd see it.
1. Miners start out with capital to spend.  They can buy mining equipment or they can buy bitcoin with it.
2. If you price mining in solely BTC spent and BTC earned, at the end of a calendar of mining you either are POSITIVE in BTC or you've lost BTC due to not making a profit.  The fiat cost is not important.  The amount of BTC left at the end of a calendar of mining is what matters most.
3. If you have less BTC than you started with, you might still have a fiat profit!   How is that better than had they bought and held BTC instead of mining?  Imagine that they started with $500,000 which at that point was say 500 BTC at $1000 each and at the end of mining including block fees earned and block rewards earned and discounting maintenance and overhead they end up with only 450 BTC at $1200 each.  That's $500,000 to start and $540,000 to end.  Does that mean the miners did good?  Fuck no.  If they just bought more bitcoin instead of mining, they'd be at 500 BTC @ $1200 = $600,000.  FIAT DOESN'T MATTER TO MINERS.
This is why this sub is filled with fools.  They can't comprehend the duality of bitcoin's investment nature.  They only look at fiat.

I met Harry Browne in the early 90s and he turned me on to his so-called "Permanent Portfolio" which I slightly adapted at a young age.  Browne's portfolio has a huge underground fan base because it's worked so well since the 90s. 
My portfolio goes beyond Browne's 4 categories by adding real estate and crypto.  I added crypto in 2012 but not a large amount and then in 2013 I realized crypto needed a permanent space in my overall investment direction.  I only keep 4-8% in crypto due to high volatility but it's worked very well even with bitcoin's volatility.

No, if I want to be my own bank, I can.  There's no privacy in bitcoin to begin with, a good friend of mine owns one of the popular bitcoin analysis companies that regulated firms rely on and he's shown me with my transactions (that I thought were anonymous) how he can gain information from them.  Bitcoin is far from anonymous.
Bitcoin gives you flexibility in being a bank if you want to pay the costs, or using other banks for negligibly small transactions that don't matter.  Keeping $5000 in Coinbase and $250,000 in your private wallets is smart.  I use Coinbase daily for free instant small transactions.

The whole point of bitcoin is to create a cryptocurrency.  If you assume Satoshi had plans to enforce and regulate such a cryptocurrency, you're missing some realities.
Third party settlement isn't contrary to the use of currency.  In fact, it's something that has historically ALWAYS been used to help individuals manage safety and facility of using a currency.
Banks were regulated for control purposes whereas bitcoin "banks" can offer what the customer wants individually.  Doesn't force anyone to use a bank.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:45:40


Oh really?  So you don't use a real bank either?  You just store your wealth in cash and mail cash to people you want to pay?
Bitcoin is "like cash".  Bitcoin isn't "like always being your own bank".  In all of human history, people not only used a medium of barter or exchange, but they used intermediaries to facilitate exchange in some situations.
When fur pelts were used as money in the US, third parties came into existence to aid in transactions -- they would convert fur to sugar or fish hooks or shoes for both parties to transact more smoothly.  They held deposits of both pelts and other commodities to aid in the transaction.
Being your own bank is great, but it means YOU are responsible for security (which has a cost in time and stress), and that YOU are responsible for successful transaction of the commodity (which has a cost in time and stress and fees).  By utilizing a third party optionally and voluntarily, you can reduce time, stress and fees if you wish.
Bitcoin isn't free. Being your own bank is not free.  There are costs.  Each individual has to decide what costs he's willing to pay, and what costs he's willing to share among others through a third party.

@_date: 2017-03-24 15:04:16
I don't just care about the price of bitcoin, I care about the security of the protocol over a long period of time.  I bought BTC at $7.  I bought at $1300.  I bought at every level in between and if it fell to $600 right now but the protocol security was safer, I would have no issue because I am still 20 years away from worrying about the price.
If Bitcoin is forced by only end users to soft fork, I think it will be contentious in what happens going forward.  I think if Bitcoin is forced to BU by the miners, I also think it will be problematic going forward.
I think Bitcoin is still immature in so many ways but the version number warns people of that already.  I know we will have a solution, but I don't trust any of them right now.
I think LN makes the most sense to me but I can't back it because I think other solutions will arise that are better.  SW, BU and the rest are just band-aids without clarity.  Neither works for everyone, and both hurts someone else.  Not a good pair of plans.
I'm neutral, I back neither the current cheap fucks who want fee-free TXs nor the greedy miners who want unlimited block size.
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:51:44
No because they need your funds to confirm so they get paid back.
If they advance you the BTC right away, and you're using a hacked account, they lose the BTC and they can't handle that risk.
7 days is charity from my perspective since it can take a bank 45 days to discover a hack.  I'm sure Coinbase loses a small percentage of new accounts to fraudulent bank transfers.

Again, the node power is imaginary because the cost to maintain a node is miniscule to the cost of mining.
If SW got 90% of nodes, what would it cost miners to add new node hardware to drop that to 80%?
Not much.
Node power isn't all fulfilling because there's little cost and no risk.  Node count can be manipulated easily and cheaply by those spending millions of dollars per year on real mining power.
Nodes are imaginary power when compared to mining.  Anyone can run a node, few can financially manage a mining rig.

Coinbase buys your bitcoins for you the moment you hit "buy".  They don't buy later.  They buy them and loan you the money until your funds clear fully from your bank, which can take up to 2 weeks depending on your bank, holidays, time of purchase, etc.
The moment you click "buy", they are buying them.  Lots of people overdraft bank accounts and some people use hacked bank accounts so Coinbase has to verify everything before approving your access to the bitcoin they bought the second you clicked buy.

Nodes validate, miners calculate.
I understand Bitcoin.  Was involved in it 5 years ago and ever since.  I understand the math.
Satoshi never provided nodes with unlimited power to do anything but validate consensus.  Nodes don't have the ability to change consensus.  
Bitcoin is a protocol maintained by miners first and foremost which is why they earn block rewards and fees.  Nodes earn nothing.  There's a reason for that.
Nodes are cheap to run so don't assume current nodes are the only ones that will exist in a SW structured Bitcoin.  It wouldn't take much to run more non-SW nodes if necessary to protect miner investment.

A block size increase isn't **needed**, but some want it.  In lieu of a block size increase, other options include:
* Off-chain settlements (these are available TODAY and are not only free but instant confirmation)
* Lightning Network (these might end up helping only those with the financial capacity to manage a large amount of transactions)
* SegWit (this might harm smaller miners and actually allow mining power to become more monopolized by mining cartels that can afford the fee market plummeting)
* Do nothing -- this is my current position as I believe a fuck ton of TXs were just BU sponsored blockchain spam.  I think we need to work through the theories more and let Core devs come up with a better solution that manages everyone's position.

This is the problem when you give a voice to people.  I'm not against speech, I'm against the value in speech.
Bitcoin doesn't give people equal rights to speak freely.  It gives consensus to those who earned their percentage of the voter.
I personally believe in property rights and votes for those who maintain and upkeep the property asset.  Mining offers a similar perspective: if you don't maintain and upkeep the blockchain, you get no voice.  If you want a voice, start mining.
Otherwise your statist nonsense bullshit is just that.  Powerless.

What people?  The people who don't matter?  Don't assume all people agree with that as a definition of economic majority.  I personally don't care about the current fiat value of a young crypto currency.  I care about its stability over 20 years.  What happens today or next year is irrelevant to the overall scheme of things FOR ME as an individual who wants to supplant fiat "some day".
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:32:05
The fact that Satoshi built miners as the majority rules tells me that if we want a voice, we should mine.
3 years ago I tried to get a bunch of users and businesses to co-op mining costs together as "a cost of doing business".  People laughed at me for trying to do that but I was serious.  I would seriously pay $100-$200 a month to a real mining co-op right now but we can't be competitive and no one else wants to do it. Cloud mining is fraudulent, but if we had a co-op that actually worked, we could take back majority rule with 50,000 small bitcoin users.  That would be $5 million a month in co-op funds.

Biggest headache is vetting new tenants.  If you pick good tenants, you have no headaches.
Example: one of my long term tenants over 8 years was an immigrant (European) who wanted no credit or background check.  He offered to pay cash up front for the year.  I accepted.  Old blue collar guy.
Every year around the anniversary he would come over to my house with a stack of $20s and just prepay.
When he finally decided to go back to the mother country, we did a walk through of the unit I hadn't seen in over 8 years.  He literally put in expensive tile floors, a totally brand new bathroom, a new kitchen, painted and patched everything.  I think he put $15,000 into the apartment without once asking for a dime.
The guy who lives in that apartment now just brings over cash every month and usually overpays by a little bit.  I think he's been there 4 years or so and he's ahead on rent by at least 7 months just by overpaying a little bit.  Never has ONCE complained or asked for any help.  Last year he told me he wanted to replace the air conditioning unit so I told him buy the nicest one that fits and I would reimburse him.  He bought one, put the old one in storage and told me not to worry about it since he loves the new unit and if he ever leaves he will take it with him.
My worst tenants are white young women with animals.  Constant complaints about things being broken, pets fuck up the floors and mouldings and door knobs and whatever.  I don't rent to pets anymore.  While I legally have to accept female tenant applications, I would generally pick a blue collar guy over anyone.
I wish I bought more units when I was still working and had capital to gamble with.  One guy I mentor to over the past 10 years is not even 30 years old and he's built an empire of apartments to rent -- all with a shitty income and shitty job and no college degree.  I believe he told me he will have 18 units before age 35 -- $100,000 a year in income at age 35, with a shitty job, shitty part time job, no college degree and no real skills.  Just stunning to me that someone can buy $850,000 in units in just 10 years of work.  The numbers don't even appear to add up until you write down how he built his empire.

All bitcoin transactions are publicly listed on the blockchain, for all of history, forever.
So when you send funds to someone else, Coinbase knows those balances were from your account and they can watch where the funds go in the future.  If you withdraw funds to sell on LBC and the person receiving them is buying drugs right away, Coinbase knows you're the originator of those funds.
The blockchain is public.  Anyone can track funds.  Most people can't say what your funds are, but Coinbase knows.

I think Bitcoin is a fantastic store of wealth for those who can afford to risk up to 6% of their assets in it.  I've been in bitcoin since 2012, and I always have 4-8% of my total net worth in crypto.
I don't think it's a great currency yet.  I think it will be, some day, maybe in 5 years, maybe in 20 years.  I don't want them to rush engineering a currency solution if it means it will destroy its store of wealth value.
Gold is an excellent store of wealth but a shitty currency.  Bitcoin needs to overcome some engineering issues, and it will, in time.  Or third parties will make it a great currency.
I don't expect volatility to go down because bitcoin can be transacted 24/7/365 across hundreds of exchanges and platforms unlike most investments that require a broker or broker-dealer on time and day limited exchanges that have stop loss programs in place.

They want to do this to avoid paying high TX fees unnecessarily when Coinbase allows them a secure and cheaper method for TX.
This is a good thing as it keeps transactions off the blockchain that are likely small and would use a lot of fees as overhead.
Plus it means they don't have to deal with wallet security internally, alleviating fears of having to manage private keys more carefully.

Bitcoin is volatile.  It once went from $1200 to $500 in short order.  It could go to $2000 next week or $400.  There's no guarantee.
By splitting it up you are averaging out volatility and taking less of a risk.  Of course if the price went up you'd have less reward but less risk is smarter than gambling.

I agree but I am not convinced that LN or SW are good options yet.
People say that offchain settlement companies would turn bitcoin into relying on banks, but that isn't true.  You will always have the freedom to settle directly -- and pay competitive fees.  Or you can chose both options, say using a third party that you send a balance to for future needs, and also keep your own on-chain transactions if you want that.
Bitcoin allows for markets to grow based on what users want for themselves.

That's the beauty of bitcoin.  For large transactions you can be your own bank and pay fees.  For small ones, you can let someone else deal with it at no cost to you.  Or you can be your own bank for small transactions and pay competitive and ridiculously high fees.

Offchain settlements.  Free tx and no confirmation delays.  When you decide to rechain your balance you pay a fee.  Otherwise use the offchain funds to make future purchases as desired.

@_date: 2017-03-14 19:10:32
Merchants will use a payment processor who will handle off-chain transactions and do settlements to the blockchain multiple times a day.  This is the most likely situation.
If you use a popular off-chain "wallet", you just top it off whenever you want to have a balance there, and that "wallet" company will integrate with merchants and deal with small/micro payments off the blockchain.

If nodes mattered, they'd earn fees and rewards.  Nodes earn nothing.  Nodes can replaced or added to easily and cheaply compared to mining.
Nodes are a gimmick right now.  Any mining group could run more nodes to offset bad node consensus.  But node runners can't just mine without high costs and risks.
Nodes are a dream world for dreamers. Miners make the decisions since mining is extremely rare and risky. Nodes aren't rare, aren't risky.

Not true.
If miners want to take over the node majority, they can spin off 10,000 nodes tomorrow.  How many nodes can you maintain on your limited bandwidth and processing power at home?
Nodes are an eyewash.  Miners can (and will!) increase how many nodes they run if they want to manipulate node consensus.
Mining hashrate can't be cheaply and easily manipulated, node quantity can.  Running a node is cheap and easy.  Anyone can do it, but miners can do it 10,000 times tomorrow.

Yep.  Different credit card authorization companies use different data to verify a card is used by its owner.  If you're using a card under someone else's name, a very tight authorization company will decline it.

Doing nothing is fine.  If people want to pay zero fees and get instant confirmations on small purchases (like ordering coffee or some $100 item), they can RIGHT NOW do off-chain settlements.  That's free, and there's no confirmation time.
For those who want to "be their own bank" they just have to deal with fee competition until such time that we reach TRUE consensus between users and miners.
Bitcoin is in alpha testing still, version 0.14.  It is not a full release candidate software.  Pushing unnecessarily quick patches can fuck up the protocol long term in ways we can't even imagine.

Miners aren't given that power, they're granted it by right of being the only ones with a voice in the protocol foundation.

No.  The wallet doesn't interact with the confirmation, the blockchain only does.

Weekly autobuys means volatility doesn't matter to me at all.

I agree with your points.  I pondered this for over a year trying to come up with a viable bitcoin tip method and nothing ended up working in theories other than offchain.
Maybe having an open record of settlements that show every deposit, every withdrawal, every balance and let people compare that settlement record with an actual bitcoin address to show that you aren't running off with funds...  Plus allowing you a small profit that is also disclosed in the audit record.
But then you have to host that audit record or at least post it on some free spreadsheet app online.
It's a lot of work, and I hope it pays off for you!  The prior bitcoin tip bots were a huge resource to introduce Redditors to magic internet money and it's a shame they're gone but I'm glad someone is stepping up!

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose or lose access to temporarily.
I invest $100 a week, every week, and have since 2013.  Some weeks I invest up to $50 more.  I don't even look at the price of Bitcoin anymore, haven't looked at it in probably over a year.
I just do my autobuy every Thursday and if I feel I have a little extra I buy some more.  If I skip a restaurant one week, that's $20 more for Bitcoin.
$100 a week isn't a lot of money, so volatility is reduced by dollar-cost averaging.

Once that's in there and approved, you can instantly buy.  You can also instantly sell BTC from your Coinbase BTC wallet into your Coinbase USD wallet and that money is instantly available.

That's always true in any currency struggle.  Always.  Politically-speaking, I have more control over the US dollar than you likely do.  That's because I have more of it to intimidate politicians with than you likely do.
Bitcoin is no different.
The thing is, what miners have power TODAY may not be the same thing in a year.  If China decides to withdraw subsidized electricity support for miners, guess what happens to Chinese miners?  They exit.
In 10 years, we might get to a point where mining at home is feasible.  Who knows?  I have a lot of excess solar in my home in Chicago -- I could actually mine profitability if I wanted to.  In 10 years, Chinese subsidized electricity could disappear entirely, and then mining might switch to New Zealand or Africa or who the fuck knows where.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:22:43
No it isn't.  That's because many of us old timers WERE miners back in the day.  And whenever you consider mining, you have to consider the costs in BTC, not in fiat.  The fiat price of BTC doesn't matter because if it goes up in value but your overhead costs skyrocket, then you might have been better served just buying and holding BTC versus mining at all.
The reason people are anti-miner is because they can't conceive of the profit/costs/overhead in BTC.  People who buy and hold only care about the FIAT price, whereas miners care about the BTC profit only.
The fiat price is uneventful for miners because they are comparing the profit of mining versus the profit of buying and trading directly.

Miners don't mine in fiat, they mine in BTC price and their overhead costs are value-estimated in BTC price at the time of cost payment.
Fiat doesn't mean much to miners.  If they mine 250 BTC a month but their overhead is 251 BTC a month, the fiat price doesn't matter.
Also, you can't assume BTC price will go up in fiat based on SegWit activation.  That's a ridiculous premise.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:02:18
Yep the BTC was purchased and is basically in Coinbase's equivalent of an escrow account in your name but not in your account yet.
Once they get the first settlements from the bank, and a few days of waiting to make sure it's not revoked, they will release the bitcoin to you.
It's still a huge risk to them because the bank can revoke transfers for up to 60 days even -- if you used a hacked account and the account owner doesn't notice the hack until their next statement.
Coinbase takes very high risks for very low returns with new accounts.  If I ran a BTC website like them, I'd hold new deposits for probably 2 months, lol.

I've been invested in the gold mining market since the early 1990s -- I knew Burt Blumert and Dr. Paul personally and did well with gold mining stocks for a decade.
The gold market is NOT just financial hedge by any means.  The amount of gold used in an average smartphone or tablet is worth over $1.  Think about how many devices are made and sold a year.
The last report for industrial purposes just for electronics put it at least 400 tons a year.  Almost 20% of gold mined annually is used in electronics.
Another 1200 tons, or nearly 50%, is used for jewelry purposes in India and the rest of Asia.
That's 70% of gold mined that isn't used for currency settlements or hedges.
Of the remaining 30%, about 20% of the total is used for investment purposes or government holdings.  Call it 500 tons a year for that purpose.
Bitcoin's sole purpose right now is a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and a large balance transaction medium.

Not necessarily.  Let's say that the coffee shop uses Coinbase for settlement.  Let's say that you use Blockbase, a competitor to Coinbase.  Blockbase and Coinbase have an agreement to handle settlements between the two, similar to ClearXChange for fiat banks.
So if my Coinbase coffee house wants $5, I tell Blockbase to send $5 (offchain) from my offchain wallet.  $5 disappears, Blockbase signals Coinbase that the transaction is safely in escrow, and Coinbase releases $5 of funds to the coffee house's off-chain wallet.
At some point that day, Coinbase and Blockbase do an on-chain settlement.  They may not have to if their escrow balances are equal, though.  If they aren't equal, they only settle on-chain whatever difference there is.

The only people who are fearful of bitcoin's volatility are idiots who bought more than they can afford to lose.
People who buy small amounts within an affordable range don't really give a fuck if bitcoin fluctuates +/- $400 every month.  We buy for the long run, as a small portion of our overall portfolio.

I have some posts come out about it from a yellow pill perspective actually -- but it should coincide fine with your behavior goals, too!
The basic premise for me is that bitcoin is part of abundance mentality and since you can buy $10-15 every week or two like clockwork automatically, it doesn't require a lot of mental energy.  I've been doing autobuys of $100-$150 per week for many years now, and every year I pretty much have to sell some to rebalance my portfolio.
Keeping bitcoin private from third parties is something you can optionally do -- it's a great financial vehicle for less burdensome disclosure and declarations if the person wants it that way.
No one knows how much bitcoin I own except for my accountant and lawyer.  My will includes distributing my bitcoin assets to certain parties through my trusted advisors, though.
Bitcoin was probably 10% of my ability to retire young but I am not a bitcoin millionaire by any means.  It also has come in handy internationally (twice now) when I needed a commodity asset other than cash.

Regression lines are fine for looking for market *trends* but not future facts.  They're helpful when comparing non-disparate vehicles -- which is all I might use them for.
Circlejerkers use regression lines to assume future facts in order to circlejerk.  If you want to get deeply involved, follow the timing of regression posts on Reddit or any investment forum by the person posting it and then look at recent price histories correlated to their activity on the forum.
I many cases, I bet you will see more frequently posting AFTER a major price correction because that individual is a bagholder who wants to liquidate an unsavory position where they overbought during a pump and probably couldn't afford their position for a longer hold.
I don't trust anyone who uses regressions to assume future performance -- it is, at best, a method to look at trends and compare trends.  It's useless as an indicator of value or if a single vehicle is a good investment.

Bitcoin is a tough one to analyse so I don't.  I just buy $100-$150 automatically weekly, and every January I rebalance my portfolio from there.  Bitcoin has been a trend leader MOST years that needed liquidating to balance that portion for me.
Overall, the Chinese put a lot of undo pressure on volume and demand and I personally *feel* that $950 is too high for the current demand levels.  I personally have my own "expected realized value" at $660 actually -- not because of any particular math per se, but my own baseless estimates of actual demand from hardgoods suppliers, dark nets pressure from monero, and liquidity concerns in exiting BTC positions in jurisdictions with tight money export regulations.  
That being said, my $150 autobuy this week won't be halted -- it never is.  In my research, at least 17 markets are on the cusp of coming into BTC in order to escape currency export laws, so I do expect some nice jumps, but I still don't feel confident in the price for the current quarter or two.
Could it go to $1200?  Certainly.  I think it's more likely to have a correction of sorts and freak a lot of short term investors out for a short period of time.
Long term I think it'll go up in value as long as no bugs are discovered and the block limit cap gets resolved.  Being a future deflationary asset is rare -- no other such assets exists.  So I think once we overcome so of the early bargaining concerns, it probably has a near limitless reach especially as currency controls become more common (Eurozone, Russia, India, etc).

Yeah I've heard about this and I'm not sure why it happened to people.  It would probably bother me but I do autobuys weekly and don't care so much about the price.  I don't buy to day trade, I buy to either hold as savings or spend on purchases.
I don't even look at the BTC price anymore, it's irrelevant to me.  Long term I expect it to go up, way up, but right now it's a risky form of savings and a nice way to get people interested in BTC.  Coinbase is easier than other methods.

If you steal electricity or get it for free from government subsidies you can probably turn a profit.
I know someone who bought some mining equipment when BTC hit a high point and then it dropped so they replaced that BTC by buying more at a way cheaper price.  They're mining profitably but they get free electricity without stealing it -- I don't think he makes very much, though.

I support the Bitcoin protocol in growing and becoming more applicable to the kinds of transactions it's designed for.
I don't see much point in forcing the protocol to adhere to 100% of humans when the protocol is obviously best suited to technically savvy individuals and companies and can be transparently utilized by them, while allowing others to provide services to less savvy individuals in the forms of apps.
I never expect 90% of the world to understand how the Internet even works -- the fact that it works well for them is because people have provided GUIs to it.
I guess I could do it all at the bit level via IP, but I prefer to hire Reddit to do it for it.  Or gmail.  Or Facebook.
Bitcoin is more a protocol than an interface.  Interfaces that work are readily available.  I bet if I went to make a purchase from a vendor who uses Coinbase and I used my Coinbase balance, it wouldn't take 19 hours to confirm.  Or I could load up any of my Bitcoin wallets and try to calculate the necessary fee to make it confirm fast.

I'm respected in food reward research and also did quite well helping a few hundred people start fashion boutique brands over the past 10-15 years.

Well I bought into BTC back in the beginning -- even sold valuable goods for BTC.  Even worked (my labor) for BTC -- because of the math.
The math proves BTC's long term value.
Miners only work based on the actual math, the provable profits of earnings minus costs = profits.
If SegWit can provably earn them more money TODAY, they would switch TODAY.
You don't have the math.  If you did have the math, you'd post it.  From a computer.  Later tonight.  As a new post.
I actually DO understand the math.  SegWit math doesn't show a potential for a profit anymore than a loss (of energy, efficiency, etc).  If I was mining, I'd not do SegWit right now.

I'm 42 and I've never in my life seen a dreamer become successful.
On the other hand, the doers are out actually DOING something about it.
Sitting around fapping over millionaire fantasies actually allows your brain to release dopamine (and serotonin and other happy hormones and neurotransmitters) which can sap motivation to become successful.
Dreamers always dream; they never do.
Doers succeed and once they succeed they create realistic dreams based on their financial assets.

That's why it's a risk with a reward.
I can look at a wave and confidently say I can catch and ride it or not.  It's foreseeable but still involved some risk.
I can call my girlfriend up and say come over, I want to have sex.  It's foreseeable as likely.
Bitcoin and any investment is unforeseeable.  Anyone can take ANY mainstream I vestment and say "well this will be more valuable in the future" against USD because we know USD is inflationary and loses value over time.  So popular assets  versus USD over an unspecified period of time will likely be more valuable by an unspecified amount.

The reason the world is in so much debt and the reason wealth is transferred so easily from poor to rich is because of inflationary fiat currency.  The rich get access to new capital first and the poor can't save for the future because money is devalued too quickly.
By giving poor people a reason to save, they can finally earn value long term.  And rich people will still need to spend -- if they hoard, the value goes up and it'll mean they're more likely to spend it when it's worth it to.

I retired 100% last year.  At 42.  I rebalanced my portfolio every January since 1999.  And every year I heard from tons of people that I shouldn't do that.
All those people are still working their lives away.
Right now my income is zero except for rental income and random donations here and there.  Rebalancing Bitcoin allowed me to expand my holdings in other areas like rental income.  I sold some Bitcoin this month to put towards the boat I plan to live on in winter months.
My current portfolio is all I have to live on for the rest of my life.  As such, holding value is superior to future extreme profits.  If BTC goes up and up, I'll sell more to keep my portfolio balanced as I have successfully done for almost 20 years.
Bitcoin wasn't a path to wealth for me.  It was a portion of my path to long term stability overall.

Coinbase user since the start.  Have recommended Coinbase to literally thousands of people and dozens of customers who paid me in BTC.
So far, out of all my recommendations to real people I know, zero of them have had issues.  For years.
The 3 people I have met online who had issues all had also either overdrafted their bank on a buy, or they did something involving illegal transactions -- which they shouldn't do with a federally regulated bitcoin bank.
What is your story?  Overdraft?  Illegal transaction?

Probably 90% of bitcoin players have next to no value and just want to create disinformation against economic realities in order to pump because they're freaked out their 30 day value has dropped 15% lol.
I do bitcoin the way I do gold.  The same way I do property: I buy a certain amount, every week, and ignore price trends.  I've been autobuying since Coinbase first allowed it because it's easy and takes no time.
I also buy gold and silver every week or two.  I also put fiat money aside every week to try to buy more rental properties for income.
Bitcoin is beautiful because it's similar to gold except gold will likely always increase in supply as the market calls for more, whereas bitcoin is limited and every new cycle means less of it -- and people LOSE bitcoin every day because they're unprepared.  I know a few friends who lost 10-20 BTC last year because of bumbling reasons, lol.  In the long run, Bitcoin will probably be deflationary, which is the ultimate currency in my mind.

That's a ridiculous premise.
If bitcoin goes to $1MM per BTC, we will transact at $1000 per mBTC or $1 per μBTC and prices will be in mBTC or μBTC.
The people saving will likely still want to spend money -- deflationary currencies give people reason to save and not spend but eventually you have to eat and live.
It'll be better for the poor because they can make the responsible decision to put off buying Nikes or KFC and store their money knowing it will be more valuable tomorrow or a year from tomorrow.

I've been turning my ideas into realities for 30 years.  In those 30 years, I have never ONCE told anyone about my idea, or hinted at it, or promoted anything until it was working.
The brain relies on reward hormones and neurotransmitters (dopamine and serotonin mostly).  Just talking about an idea is enough to satisfy your brain chemically in ways similar to actually putting an idea into motion or succeeding.
No one is going to do jack shit for you ever if you don't either have a LOT of money or at least a working example to pitch.
If you don't have money, get off Reddit and work 2-3 part time jobs 80-100 hours a week until you do.  Then hire a lawyer, write up an NDA contract, and start engineering your product with or without paid help.
In 30 years, I've seen thousands of people post or talk about their million dollar idea -- all of those people are bigger losers today than they were then.
Successful people don't talk about success, they work hard at it.  Unsuccessful people just spin their wheels dreaming.
Stop dreaming, get off Reddit, and start working towards success.  Money, connections and working example code are all you need.  Every day you delay is a day closer that someone else will come up with the same idea but have the assets and capital in place to make it a reality.

Ha, I have a post up about starbucks, in fact.  It's a funny thing to discuss -- I know you were just being funny, but let's consider this:
* [Average Starbucks Order per day]( $4
* Average orders per month of Starbucks: 30
* Average monthly Starbucks cost: $120
Invest $120 per month at 7% return over a period of time and you will end up with:
* 10 years -- $20,760
* 20 years -- $62,400
* 30 years -- $146,400
Of course those are LONG periods of time, but those lattes add up!
One kind of amazing this is that if you withdraw 4% annually from an investment, you can actually get free Starbucks for life by just investing for 12 years and then withdrawing 4% annually to cover your spending.

But you are a fucking moron because you refuse to do the math.
$16 per hour in earnings working a regular 9-5 job PLUS a part time job totalling 80 hours a week while living as frugal barebones as possible WILL return enough to buy your first rental property in less than 2 years.  Assuming your net takehome pay on 80 hour workweeks is $1000 and that your living expenses are under $500 a month, you can be socking away $3500 a month for 2 years.  In the 4 markets I have invested in, I have found rental properties as cheap as $60,000 that generate upwards of $650 a month after (deductible) expenses and costs.  2 more years of working 80 hour weeks plus your $650 reinvestment brings you to owning another rental property after just 4 years.
Not only is it feasible but people do it every day -- with no skill set, no education, no wealthy parents.
Just because you are a moron doesn't mean others are.

Anyone who is buying smartly is dollar cost averaging every pay period for around the same amount for a long period of time.
People who are daytrading are the market losers many times because they're gambling with money they can't afford to lose.
I just looked at my returns and for the past 12 months I'm up 750%.  That's an insane return.  
I'll keep buying my $100-$150 a week, every week, as I have for many years.  And not worry about volatility in the short run.  6 months or 12 months of downward pressure lets me buy more and there's only going to be 21MM bitcoins produced, so I keep owning a larger and larger share.
$7000 is cheap.  $20,000 feels cheap to me, too.
Bitcoin is the only crypto with massive financial support but still has a black market supporting it as well.  For me, those are the most important factors long term.
I don't day trade.  I make my wealth slowly and patiently.

my mom is near foreclosure actually.  She's retired and broke.  My dad lives in a tiny 2 bedroom rental apartment.  He's retired and on disability because he's blind.  My parents didn't give me dollar one -- both were immigrants and both worked regular jobs and kicked me out of the house when I was a teenager.


Nope!  Join a FIRE studio.  Near me I am mentoring to 4 young guys (age 18-23) who all live in a 0-bedroom studio apartment with 2 bunkbeds (4 living in 400 square feet).  They share their rent together ($575/4 = $144 per month each).  They share meals and grocery costs (approximately $45 per week per person).  They don't have cable or internet or expensive smartphone plans.  Most of them work a main job (9-5 in some cases) plus a night job plus weekend jobs.  The average person in the FIRE studio spends about $330 a month for all expenses, but earns somewhere between $4000 and $7000 a month in income at all levels.  They are committed to this lifestyle for 3-4 years minimum to get up to the $250,000 they need each to buy a good sized rental property or three.

You broker the deal by making offers to owners direct for cash and if they bite on the offer, then you invest time in closing the deal.


Not true.  I don't know anyone who owns real estate who considers it even a part time job -- minus emergencies, of course.  Yes, there are some stressful periods here or there, but if you do it well and slowly expand your empire to afford a super, you'll do better than most people who just consume luxuries for 10 years and then they're 31 years old and have nothing ahead but more work until they die at 72 with mortgages left to pay.

Bitcoin won't replace banks because people will need banks for the value added resources they provide (including credit).  In the long run, bitcoin offers the option for a person to be their own bank, but most have no desire to be their own bank if the market provides banks that are competitive, secure, insured, etc.
This is why I have no problem leaving small amounts on banks like Coinbase ($25,000 or less).  I trust them with small amounts of money to be more secure and available than I can be with my private keys.
For large amounts, I'd prefer to be my own bank but it adds a lot of headaches and overhead for me to manage.
Bitcoin's power, to me, is the end of inflationary debt-based currency.  But I have no issue with banks being part of the market for crypto.

Deflation would definitely be worse for addict consumers, but I'm not among those.  Deflation would be worse for those who refuse to save, but I'm not among those.
For those who DO save and don't thrive online on useless plastic consumption, deflation is going to be the happy dance because it means we won't have to spend unless we find real value in spending.


I hope it doesn't.  I hope there are always competitive fiat and cryptocurrencies, in fact.  I can see bitcoin dominating from the current network effect but who knows what features will be in demand in the future?
I like that bitcoin allows us the option to bank ourselves, but I also like that bitcoin has a big enough network effect that I don't have to trade bitcoin for fiat in some shady alley.

I don't force anyone to do anything, ever.  I help people who want to become wealthy, and I do so without charging a dime.  I encourage young guys to move back in with parents as much as possible.  Some guys will just couch surf for 2-3 years if they can.  There's one guy who started in 2014 at age 18 who lived in his beater of a car year round even in winter, and now owns 2 rentals.
The amount of time you invest in managing real estate is definitely higher in the beginning, but it's not burned labor that most people have invested in their path to forever poverty.  That 18 year old who lived in his car?  He was playing video games and watching TV for 65 hours a week when he was 17.  65 hours a week x $16 = $1040 gross or maybe $750 net he was "paying" for his bullshit loser digital addictions.  Learning to fix toilets or unclog kitchen sinks or patch and paint = free education that he is getting paid rent for.  
My ex girlfriend is just under 30 and she now owns over 30 rental units.  She bought them all herself, with $0 leveraged, $0 on loans.  She's a super star in what she does and I bet she works no more than 5 hours a week average and won't turn 30 until this December.  She started with a net worth of around -$160,000 because of her useless engineering degree, and she did it by living in a literal closet for 4 years (she rented someone's closet, threw a single mattress in there and had a lightbulb for light).  She paid $75/month for rent for 4 years doing it. That's also when we dated (I met her through a FIRE club near Chicago).  It was awesome living.  She was eating tuna out of a can (unheated) for most of those 4 years.  Now she's got a net worth of over $2.5MM and 30 rentals bringing in around $23,000 a month gross.

As long as there are at least 4 people mining with their vintage TI85 calculators' processors, bitcoin will be fine.
You just need enough folks mining so that nobody controls 51% of mining power.  If it means 4 people are doing bitcoin mining math calculations by hand with a pen and paper, it's enough.
Technically you could even have 3 miners total using old 8088 PCs from 1981, but 4 would be a bit safer so there's no 51% issue.

My dad came from India.  On a boat.  He left Mumbai in 1958 or so with $100 in his pocket.  Took a boat to UK (took months) then took a boat to NYC, then go to Chicago.  Then he was a waiter bussing tables.  For years.
My mom came from communist Poland on a boat in 1972 or so -- she had $15 to her name that the government allotted her.  She worked as a waitress until I was 6 or 7.  Didn't speak any English then, either.

My doctor is 86 and just started taking supplemental testosterone 3 years ago.  Up until age 83 he was still riding horses, sailing solo and having sex with his wife (25 years younger).  Now he's still in great shape.
My other mentor is 62 and he looks like he's 40.
I'm 44, but I typically date women half my age and I know for a fact I can outpace most guys half my age.  I have more mental and physical stamina because I'm not distracted by addictive behavior.
My father is 77 this year.  He was 51 when he married his next wife who was 20.  They have a kid together.  I hear his current girlfriend is in her late 20s, but he's not rich or fit.  He's having a blast and lives in a cheap 2 bedroom apartment, lol.

Yes, time in market is better than timing the market, but in my reverse analyses of all my investments, I didn't have the money to buy all-in at one point and wait it out.
There are over 37,000 blog posts discussing the DCA versus all-in comparisons.
I post on reddit using my real name and I've been posting my investment spreadsheets online for over 12 years for people to analyze.  I took them all off line when I retired in 2015 though, but if someone wants to compare investments, I'm always happy to discuss in private.

Loser alcoholics do that.  Loser addicts also watch TV for 45 hours a week or play video games for 45 hours a week or fap to porn for 45 hours a week.
Addicts are losers.  I was a loser through my entire 20s.  I broke those addictions.


Because if you sacrifice fun for 10 years and invest it, after 10 years your fun is paid 100% by your investment yield without ever touching the principal.
So someone can work their asses off from age 16-26 and the rest of their lives their "fun" is paid for by investments.

I follow a modified version of Harry Browne's Permanent Portfolio (HBPP, adapted to include real estate, forex and crypto).


I retired at age 41.  I'm 44 now.  100% of my paper profits are still in my portfolio.  I try hard to never liquidate/sell positions EXCEPT in the rare instance that I have to rebalance my portfolio per HBPP annually.  
I have sold a LOT of bitcoin since I started investing in 2012 only because the ramp ups in price caused a massive imbalance in my portfolio goals.
I live on strictly dividend yield now, but I live well below my income so I am constantly rolling weekly excesses into my portfolio to try to keep it at my specific percentages.  
According to my analysis, even in an the event of multiple market catastrophes (lasting 3-4 years each), I should be able to live nicely until I am 236 years old, lol.
Bitcoin is just one part of my portfolio.  Bitcoin doesn't generate a dividend yield, so it's equivalent to gold or forex, not rental properties or dividend stocks.

It's worse than FUD, it's people who have a net worth of $-30,000 due to shitty student loans who are able to only invest about $50 with a 5% credit card purchase fee and then they freak out that their life savings is only worth $42 a day later and they're wondering if bitcoin will ever go up enough for them to profit a whole $2.
The only bitcoin forums I trust are the ones where people sign their signatures with proof that they actually own more than 10 BTC.  That's it.  Still anonymous enough, but at least you know the person talking doesn't have their head up their ass with probably $42 in BTC value.

I'm an austrian economist by hobby and I've used inflationary currencies to profit way more than the average banking customer.  I know it's a scam but I don't really care to prove it to others who don't know how to profit from the system.


Hence why large amounts make sense for certain conservative individuals to deposit with an insured bitcoin bank -- which will come in time as the market pressures make a need for it.
Bitcoin and crypto in general is too young still.  It's still very high risk and the algorithms aren't perfected.  I figure in 20 years we should have a good idea of what the market will need to make it useful as a currency.  I only invest 6% of my net worth and net incomes into bitcoin, so it's an amount I can afford to lose.
I've been investing since 2012, but I also invest across a host of vehicles and generally suggest nobody put all their eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:21:30
I would hope they did short it.  Market makers are the ones who help reduce volatility, not increase it.
Remember, shorting has a lot more risk than buying and holding.  When you buy and hold, you're not risking losses to cover.  Shorting is very high risk.
If shorting was easy risk-free profits, everyone would do it.  I've only shorted bitcoin twice, I had to borrow actualy bitcoin from friends to do it, and I took a shit ton of risk because if the price went up, I'd have to cover those losses with fiat.

We do have evidence.  It's called the business cycle.   Government doesn't print money out of thin air to give to everyone and every market equally.

I’ve been involved in bitcoin since 2012 and have met a lot of people since.  Plus I run a somewhat popular early retirement planning group and some of those guys have been following me from before they were rich.
Nouveau riche dudes tend to flock together too.  Although at a certain level you tend to attract royals and heirs but typically the newly wealthy are still not socially acclimated to the lifestyle.  
One of them most common problems with becoming stinking rich is losing all your old friends and family and having to wade in a pool you are grossly undersocialized for.  I help there too because wealth never attracted me but it never scared me either.

No it isn't, you're right.  I'm throwing up some of my experiences at poor-me.com today to explain it better to those who can't believe they're buying poverty.  But they are.  The math shows it, time and time again.
In 2017 I analyzed over 600 reverse budgets and close to 95% of the people who submitted their reverse budgets to me in Excel format were actually destroying a minimum of $160,000 in wealth over the past decade.  A minimum, and that was 95% of them.  Something like 80% of them destroyed over $260,000 in wealth in the past decade.  And just under half destroyed over $500,000 in wealth.
It's staggering to see and witness.  We just destroy wealth because we feel entitled to it, or because everyone else destroys wealth so we do it, too.

It doesn't require that at all.  Lots of FIRE folks don't have rental properties.  Just in my specific groups that I mentor in, most of them want to be landlords or at least home-share owners (airbnb, etc).  I know FIRE kids who made their first million in other markets, not just housing rentals. 


"Have a life" meaning you want to work until you're 72?  If you're OK with that, great!  I am fine with folks who want that stress.  I didn't want to work past 40, but I had to work til 41.5 to hit my net worth goals and exit out of my work contracts cleanly.
I actually plan on selling all my real estate over the next 2-7 years when valuations are too high (hot market expectation) so that I can live on my sailboat for 300+ days a year.  That's my goal now, and I'm edging closer to it every day.
I know one very young FIRE kid (she's 16, lives about 20 miles from me, parents brought her to a FIRE meeting at age 14 because she was a rebellious teenager with lots of drama) who dropped out of high school and now manages teenagers-for-hire for a good profit.  She finds teenagers jobs like lawn mowing or snow blowing or basement/garage clean-out, etc.  She gets a nice cut of the work and has a very high review rating on Facebook, etc.  It's a legit business, she hated school, and now she's on her way to being a millionaire by 25.  Her dad told me she's not hip to the idea of real estate but would consider it -- I told him she can invest in REITs long term and look at the financial benefits for holding those kinds of investments instead.
The key isn't to build wealth so that you can relentlessly consume, though.  Most people who FIRE themselves end up hating TV and video games and alcohol because we broke those addictions on our path to wealth.
I threw my TV and cable box out 8 or 9 years ago.  Haven't looked back.  I have no interest anymore.  Instead, I do background acting in Hollywood movies and TV shows (shitty pay but tons of fun and socializing plus cute actresses on set to date, lol).  I also am now starting an indie production company with my charity dollars this year (about $40,000 startup capital) to help young folks make higher quality films -- again, it's a social experience that is SO MUCH BETTER than watching TV and movies.
I don't drink alcohol but I own a small share in a winery.  It doesn't pay big profits but it's a lot of fun going there and playing with wine.  I am trying to invest in a legal still in the area but the startup costs are extravagent -- I'd rather sell my own vodka than drink someone else's though.
I don't care about Facebook or Reddit -- I post and comment looking for the 2% of young guys who want to change their lives, and then I hook them up with a mentor in their area if I know of one.  I write to attract attention from future douchebags because I had a mentor who found me and helped me change my mindset.
I am totally bored with addict living.  I think people are losers and a waste of my air, actually.  I laugh at idiots who read CNN or listen to NPR or follow Kanye or Kim.  My peers, my equals?  They're living on boats right now, or they're landlords in my communities, or they're film producers doing what they love to do.
They certainly aren't consuming loser entertainment.

Depends, really.  Since I try to live on my boat 60% of the year, if I'm doing night watch then I can't sleep.  But if I'm on land, I like to be in bed before 9pm.  I like sleeping 9 hours, so I might go to sleep by 8pm.  I love waking up before the sun rises.
Most of my "dates" with women are actually BEFORE they go to work -- maybe get together at 5am and play in the park, or whatever.  It's fun to get your endorphins boosted before your daily responsibilities.  I don't like being up too late as I find it destroys my efficiency the next day.


Well, if you aren't rich, you shouldn't have a TV anyway.  Or a nice computer.  Or a fancy car.  Or a budget for dining out or movies or concerts.  Those are for rich people, not poor people.  Poor people should be working to stop being poor, period.
Since it's only a 10 year sacrifice maximum (and many people stop being poor after sacrificing just 2 years to begin), you have to make the decision now: live like you are rich and stay poor, or live like you are poor and get rich.
I'm writing more about it at poor-me.com if you want to peek, but I registered the domain just a few hours ago so it might not have propagated yet.  It's more about examples on how one can stay poor by pretending to be rich, or one can be rich by actually living like the poor person that they are.

Yep -- luxuries are for rich people, only.  As much as the advertisers and marketing experts promote luxury-for-the-poor, if you spend money on luxuries before your investments buy them for you, you will stay poor.
If you look at my 173X rule, consider this: the person who skips out on cable TV for 10 years (a long time, yes) can almost have their investments pay for cable TV for the rest of their lives -- without those investments getting smaller.  So if you're 21 now and go without cable for 10ish years, at age 31 you can have cable TV "for free" forever more.  It's crazy to consider!
If you're under 21, you can start at age 16 and get to the point that by age 26, many of your "hobbies" and "loves" can be paid for by investments instead of by your paycheck.
Don't worry about getting paid at what you love doing.  Get paid at anything you're good at.  If that means walking door to door today asking to wash your neighbor's windows for $5, do it.  It's $5 you didn't have.  Or you can spend 8 hours on reddit instead and make $0.  What's better tomorrow?  $40 of cash after 8 hours of slave labor, or 8 hours of reddit or videogaming or netflix?
As you get more skills, you raise your rates.  I know a guy who makes 6 figures a year washing cars.  I'm not shitting you, either.  He drives to the homes of wealthy people and they pay him $300-$500 to wash and detail their expensive cars, motorcycles, etc.  He will do 2 homes of cars in a day and do that 3-4 days a week.  And he has a waiting list.  It's insane, but he started out by doing $5 washes in peoples' driveways 15 years ago, now he makes 6 figures doing it for select customers.
If you are wasting hours now, stop wasting hours.  If you can't make $50 an hour, make $25.  If you can't make $25, make $10.  And if nobody will pay you $10, work for $5.  Or $2 an hour.  It sounds horrible, but it's how you build skills, build a reputation, build a website with photos of the work you did.
Programming is great, if you can get the work.  If you can't get the work, it isn't a job.

Except they're totally 100% fine for those with tiny balances under $10,000 or even $15,000.  I have no concern about keeping $10,000 in Coinbase wallets (BTC or USD).  It's not money I worry about.  I may raise that to $25,000 this year because, again, it isn't an amount of money that will hurt me if they go under.  It's CONVENIENCE money.
If I have more than that amount, I'll transfer it to my private wallet of course and then start over from $0 with them and build back up to my comfortable exposure.
I use bitcoin to buy things.  I use it to save a small portion of my monthly yield income.  It's easy, it's free, it's fast.  I'm fine with it -- for small values under $10,000 or even $25,000.

Cryptocurrencies don't issue a profit or a yield.  They aren't profit/value stocks.
To "make a profit" one must trade in both directions, repeatedly.  This means you will have to try to time the market.

Sometimes I'll go to the park with a girlfriend and throw around a light-up frisbee.  Other times we'll go sledding if it's winter or hop on my sailboat if it's summer.
This entire weekend I am hosting a fun "drone cinematography" free session for people and I have 24 invited guests who RSVP'd and they're all fun and attractive people.  We won't be watching movies or drinking beers, that's for sure.
Last weekend I went and played tennis with a neighbor, did a "shadetree mechanic" outing at another guy's house where 6 people brought their cars and we all worked on them together to save money and learn, and I also visited a friend's indie film shoot and helped out with lighting and sound.

The only person who should go to college is the person who either has a full ride real scholarship or has wealthy parents to pay for 100% of college up front.
Anyone who borrows for college is a poor candidate for college.  I laugh at people who blow 4-5 years of their lives studying a useless degree.

I've been buying $125-$150 in BTC a week since 2012.  I've likely quite literally sold BTC worth 10s of millions by now.  My first BTC were acquired around $6.
The thing is, I don't regret any of it.  I bought rental condos thanks to BTC.  I've paid of both my primary residences.  I bought a 3-cabin sailboat last year and thanks to my investment portfolio -- not just BTC -- I am upgrading to a 5-cabin sailboat mini-yacht maybe this year.
Having $20 million now would have ZERO effect on my life.  ZERO.  I retired at age 41 and that was only a tiny bit thanks to BTC -- most of it was shrewd investing of 70-80% of my income while living more frugally than 99.99% of Americans.
Now that I'm retired and have a true "zero cost of living" thanks to my investment portfolio, I don't have to worry.  Having $10 million more wouldn't bring anything to my life at all.  I never have to work again.
I don't know anyone who timed the market well.  I know about a dozen bitcoin multimillionaires who never exited positions until they got to some insane valuation but these were guys who bought 100 BTC for $50 or less, lol.  I know a guy who had over 2300 BTC when I started and he never sold until it hit and he liquidated a few million worth back in the $2000-$3000 range and he has NO REGRETS at all.
My money works for me, I don't work for my money.  People who monitor the price of bitcoin every minute of every day have mental issues.  I look at my overall net worth once a month when it's time to reinvest some dividends or rental income checks after my cost of living.  That's it.  If my BTC is lower than the rest of my portfolio, I buy more BTC.  If my stocks are lower than the rest, I buy more stocks.
I have no idea what BTC's price is any day of the month, just like I have no idea what ANH's price is either.  I just buy more of whatever is undervalued versus my portfolio.
And I never regret "what could have been" because nobody gets rich with regrets.

I've been buying bitcoin for over 5 years now.  I don't expect a return in months.  Years, yes.  Months, no.
Same is true in the stock market.
Same is true in real estate.
I've been retired since age 41, but I've tracked all my gains since I started investing at age 17.  Most of my investments that have paid big profits took 105 months (on average) to be profitable.  
All the people who sold at a loss before the 105 month mark made me more profitable.

I think the rich, in my opinion, live on the output of their investments while the poor live on their incomes.
My "program" (which is free, I never charge for it or my time) is about forcing people to live on only their investment yield and to use income towards investing.  100% of my life is funded by living on my yields alone.  I stopped living on my income about 3 years into my FIRE plan (I started at age 31 with $-180,000 in net worth and no job) -- and by age 41.5 I was fully retired and 100% of my lifestyle is funded strictly on my profit income, versus work income.
A poor person sees a paycheck and thinks "I can buy a beer/burger/video game with this!"  A rich person sees a paycheck and says "If I invest $500 a month for 10 years, the total after 10 years will more than cover $500 a month in expenses the rest of my life."
It's a matter of "time preference" -- putting something off today so that it is "free" tomorrow.

I assume folks have to buy bitcoin to use to buy the shitcoin, but this is a good thing.  Dumb fucks who spend 10% fees buying on credit from coinbase are the ones who profitize the need for a secure third party.  We need more companies LIKE coinbase to help with the regulatory hurdles that must exist until such time that bitcoin is considered cash.

That's weird that some people say that, because:
* I'm 44 but I date millennials.  I have a pretty awesome body since I have time for the gym now and I get to play outside all day.  Both my doctors say I am in the top 99.5% of men my age.  My lung capacity exceeds that of a 22 year old.  My sprint time (220 yards) is better than in high school.  I can lift a gal over my head on the beach.  I have no stress or anxiety so my sexual performance is superior to when I was a fat drunken slob in my 20s.
* I live 60-70% of the year on a boat in the Caribbean.  Generally it's about 100-120 days on a cruise ship, and another 100-120 days on my own sailboat (3-cabin) or a sailboat I rent (4-5 cabin).  I am literally on a paddleboard or snorkeling at least 200 days a year.
* 100% of my consumer luxuries are paid for by dividend yield, not by selling stocks.  So everything I want is paid for by passive income.  **Everything**.
* Youth isn't the best time of your life, it's the time when you have the most energy and the sharpest mind and the fastest recovery.  I could have done in my 20s what I waited until my 30s to do.  I should have retired at age 30, not 41.  My 20s are a blur of drunken nights, wasted money, wasted time.  My 40s are all 100% sober and I love every day of my life.
* If I want to spend time with my aging parents, I can.  In fact, I do.  "Work" doesn't prevent me from spending time with my parents in the (possibly) last years of their lives.  I cherish my freedom to see them whenever.
* If I want to have kids now, I can.  I can spend as much time as THEY need.  I don't come home from a job I hate to watch TV shows that don't add to my life at all.  When my friends with kids travel with me, they are amazed at my endless energy (I spent 10 days at sea with 4 friends and their 3 toddlers and I never crashed from lack of energy).
* If I don't like someone in my life, I just cut them off immediately.  I don't have to give second chances to anyone because I am the prize.
* If I want to go somewhere, I go.  If I want to relax at home with a good book, I relax.  I have no boss, no demands on my time.  The people who spend time with me are people I value 100% or they're out.
The best years of my life are always "today".  I haven't had a bad day in 13 years now, and I don't expect to have many of them going forward.

I worked my ass off every day, sometimes up to 120 hours in a week.  I had my main income during the day, but I also worked side jobs at night and over the weekend.
Instead of spending money on useless crap, I invested it in a basket of different investments.
It wasn't THAT difficult, just exhausting and tiring, but I never have to work again a day in my life.  Ever.
Consider the 173 rule: if you can cut your budget by $100 a month and invest it at 7%, after 10 years you'll have 173x that amount ($17,300).
Now consider all of the useless crap that the average fat American spends on monthly.  $215 per month is the average Comcast bill for useless TV and more useless broadband (I have neither).  $215 x 173 = $37,195 after 10 years.
Buying a new car every 2-3 years is costly.  The average American spends over $650 a month on their car, gas, insurance, etc.  Cut back to driving a $1500 beater and you'll save over $500 a month -- 173 rule says $86,500 saved after 10 years.
Downsize your nice 2 bedroom apartment to a studio apartment.  Go from $1400 rent to $700.  $700 x 173 = $121,100 saved.
Only work 40 hours a week?  Work 80-90 hours a week.  The extra 50 hours bringing in even $16/hour is $2400/month net income x 173 = $415,200 saved in 10 years.
This is all basic math, but the average disgusting bloated loser consumer doesn't want to be wealthy, they want to have 610 streaming channels of Netflix and 100GB wifi and a $1500 smartphone.  Lols.

I've been posting about my bitcoin investments since 2012.  I've bought $100-$150 a week, every week, since late 2012.  I retired at age 41 (2.5 years ago) but bitcoin was only about 12% of my net worth then (6% now as I liquidated more in December to rebalance my 2017 portfolio).
I still buy $100-$150 a week, though.  In fact, starting in April I am ramping it up to $225 a week because my bitcoin portion of my net worth recently dropped below 4% so I am increase my weekly buys to rebalance it slowly.

I know a kid in some backwoods city in Georgia that isn't even on the map (didn't know this was possible) and he's 24 now and closing in on $500K in net worth even though he didn't finish high school.  Taught himself to fix farm equipment and will drive 200 miles to do it.  Crazy bank, and self taught.
I recently met a young girl through her parents, she's not even 18 year but she's been doing really well helping her neighbors sell shit on eBay and she keeps 30% but takes photos, makes the listings perfect, helps them pack and ship it.  She's going to be worth $1MM by 25 for sure.

BTC doesn't generate a profit, so owning it would be like owning gold.  It doesn't make you wealthy for having it, you are defined as wealthy because you have it.

I'd suggest reading the sidebar over at or whatever the sub is.  I don't go there myself, so I'm not sure the actual sub name but they have a great beginner's guide to investing.
My portfolio has been in effect a very long time.  I invest in many different areas so that all my eggs are in one basket.
For example:
* Bitcoin is 6-12% of my net worth -- I prefer 6% and will sell if I ever get to 12%.
* Gold/silver bullion is 6% of my net worth -- I sell annually if it's ever over 6% to reduce it.
* Real estate is 20-25% of my net worth
* Stocks are 20-25% of my net worth
* Illiquid investments are 20-25% of my net worth
Every year I will review my portfolio and buy/sell assets to balance it out.
Since I'm retired (I'm 44 but I retired at 41) I have to make sure my investments don't all lose value together.  So I have some aggressive investments, and some less aggressive ones.

I retired at 41 but bitcoin was only 5-10% of that.  I rebalance my portfolio regularly.  If bitcoin goes over 12% of my net worth I sell down to 6%, so instead of having $100 million I have far less than that, but selling bitcoin 3 times now means I was able to buy more real estate and stocks.

I usually suggest people sacrifice 2 years and see where they're at compared to when they started.  In my experience mentoring to FIRE kids for almost 10 years, about 70% of people who sacrifice the 2 years decided they can do it for 3 more years.


Except in the past 5 years, I have been to over 150 FIRE club meetings around the entire world, and I have met literally hundreds if not THOUSANDS of like minded individuals who went from $0 net worth to $1MM net worth in about a decade, sometimes 15 years.

Not as much as you'd think.  I try to keep bitcoin as 6% of my net worth but never more than 12%.  I typically rebalance quarterly.  I've sold 100s of bitcoins over the years but the profits have paid to buy more rental condos, a sail boat, and a safari in Africa, so I don't regret selling them, ever.
As long as I'm in the 6-12% net worth range I'm happy.  I'm also happy that I have a nice wide range of investments.
I never ever check the price of bitcoin EXCEPT when I look at my overall portfolio every 3-4 months to rebalance things.  Bitcoin is a hassle because of the volatility in terms of balancing my portfolio, but if I see it's over 12% of my net worth, I'll liquidate whatever I need to in order to get to 6%.
I still buy $100-$150/week, every week, no matter what the price is.  That's automatic in my investment strategy.  I also buy $100-$150 a week of other things.

Well, my advice is this:
1. Make a written budget.  Live by this budget.  If you violate this budget you have to penalize your lifestyle to correct it.
2. Save no less than 10% of your paycheck every paycheck.  If you can't, get a second job or redo your budget above.
3. Those who save 20% of their paycheck are the ones who are wealthy the fastest.
4. Don't invest for short periods of time, invest for long periods of time.  If markets "crash", you continue to buy more each paycheck.  If markets go way up, you continue to buy more each paycheck.
Yesterday I registered poor-me.com and started to put some financial restrictions people need to consider to become wealthy.  Read that.  I'm updating it as I post comments here so I should have updates on there daily.

I didn't say that $175 a week will get you to millionaire status.  I said put $175 a week into investments to start.
My returns annually for the past 27 years are about double what the Dow returned because I don't just invest in growth stocks but in yielding companies as well as real estate.  But I think 7% returns are a reasonable estimate so if you want to go from $0 to $1MM in 10 years at 7%, you just need to invest $1338 a week net -- you can do it making $16 per hour net take-home pay with 2 jobs, assuming you are young and you can live with your parents.
If you start at age 18, by 28 you can have $1MM in net worth or more.  Earning just $16 an hour take-home.  Most wealth-driven individuals earn more than that, of course.

I don't invest in growth stocks because I think they're scams.  In fact, the only real growth vehicle I'm invested in is bitcoin.
I invest in value funds that pay a real profit/dividend quarterly.  Many of my dividend stocks earn 6-12%, some as much as 20%.
See my comment here: 
My investment return on every dollar invested from 1992 until 2018 has been 18% annual average.  Yes, bitcoin is included in that, but I always rebalanced my bitcoin portfolio if it exceeded 12% of my net worth (I prefer 6%) so I've sold hundreds of BTC over the years and it hasn't exactly been a major difference over my other holdings.  Without crypto, I think my average annual return over 26 years would be 14% or maybe 15%.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:20:06


I'm 44 years old and I retired, partially thanks to crypto (generally about 6% of my net worth).  I've made money in real estate and stock markets for 26 years.  Today, I spend 60% of the year on my boat in the Caribbean and by age 45 I hope to spend 80% of the year there.
Dollar cost averaging works magic -- in stock markets, in real estate, in crypto, in bonds, in bullion.  The reason for this is every dollar you invest in SOMETHING is a $1 you aren't throwing away on video games or alcohol or some useless chinese toy.  So even if that $1 is worth $0.50 in a year, it's not worth $0 like it would be if you bought another star wars lego toy.
Dollar cost averaging smooths the volatility out like crazy.  I don't catch falling knives, I buy assets at the current value and if and when they go up, I'll have more than the guy trying to time the market with daytrading.  Usually a lot more.
FWIW in the past 26 years of investing, none of my day trading friends are retired or close to it.  Not a single one.  But ALL of my friends who dollar cost averaged are either retired or could if they hated their careers.

I believe they are now doing a hurricane relief donation of only $150,000 but it expires in a few weeks or so.  I know two guys who did that and also were told to wait a year for the passport.

Wasn't born rich, as I said in other comments, my mom is forever near foreclosure and dad lives in a small apartment -- both are poor immigrants.  I made my wealth the difficult way: frugal living and investing into medium-high risk businesses, 80% which failed but 20% which profited greatly.  Almost all the bitcoin-forward businesses I invested in failed within 3 years, but my fiat-forward businesses tended to make at least my investment back.
And, no, I won't help my parents out if they continue to act like good little voters.

The folks I know who made it in bitcoin invested slowly and patiently over time and didn’t check the price every 2 minutes and didn’t sell ever.  
Same as the folks I know who made it in the stock market over 10-15 years.

Yeah I don't live in fear.  My birthplace is Chicago and I wouldn't trust an ambulance there any better.
All of the folks I hang out with have Amex Platinum (as do I) which covers medivac costs when traveling.  Most of us have global rescue as well -- my policy includes extraction from terrorist attacks and war but that's only because I tend to go where the US military won't extract me.
My two biggest emergencies while traveling were both in Mexico (broken wrist in one case and got my nose smashed in by some drunk American in another case) and $100 (US) dollars got me to a clinic in 15 minutes or less -- and in both cases, the clinics were cleaner and better staffed than a lot of Chicago hospitals, lol.
If I need extraction, I call Global Rescue on my satellite phone and let them do their job.  We're not talking about people who can barely pay rent or have made the idiotic financial decision to have mortgages for 30 years here.  We're talking about people who actually know how to handle global travel and then pay for services properly.
One new multimillionaire I know had his pregnant wife on a motor boat and they were 2 days from a hospital when her water broke 45 days early.  A call to the Centurion concierge by satphone told him exactly what to do and where to go and how to deal with it and he ended up delivering the baby without any issue at all and was in a hospital less than 2 days later and they were ready for her and the baby.

Bitcoin is stable enough for people to budget $175 a week to buy more of it.
I've been buying $100-$150 a week, every week, since 2012, and rebalancing my portfolio if my bitcoin percentage every exceeds 12% of my net worth (I prefer it at 6%).  So I buy every week, but I'll sell half my bitcoin balance if it ever exceeds 12% -- getting me back to 6%.  Then I keep buying $100-$150 a week until it exceeds 12% again.
This works extremely well.  Every week I look at my cash value in checking and send the extra to my portfolio, be in bitcoin or stocks or real estate.
If you can't save $175 a week into your overall portfolio, you're doing something wrong or you want to be poor.  Most poor people make the choice to be poor.

Don't drop a lot of bitcoin in at once.  Set a budget of how much you'll out in per paycheck.  Do that.  If you have extra, divide it by 20 and add that amount every paycheck extra.

He drives a 1987 Toyota with no air conditioning or power windows or radio, lol.  But he's free, he can live his life doing what he wants to do, and his dating life reflects his low stress.


I suggest 2 years of sacrifice to see what happens.  It's only 2 years.
I have a lot of folks on Reddit who follow my every comment because I've been saying this same shit here since day 1 -- so they bookmark this comment today because they disagree with it, and then 2-3 years later they hit me up and say "holy fuck dude I am still stuck in the same god damn place wtf do I do now?"
There's a good number of people on Reddit who disagree with me, but come around in a few years and say "ok, I need to fix this".
The younger you are when you start, the faster it comes, the better life is.  And you're not trading your entire life for it.  You're just cutting addictions for 2 years to see what the outcome is.

For the past 11.5 years I've been helping mentor at local FIRE clubs in Chicagoland and SoFla.  In every year I've met kids as young as 15 who were "problem children", but I've also met a lot of Millennials.  Two of my ex-girlfriends were met at these functions -- always millennials.  My current girlfriend is a millennial.
The FIRE club has made a lot of millionaires in 10-15 years.  A LOT.  Many, many, many.  My current girlfriend is a millennial who became a millionaire herself in her 20s.  Her parents worked in factories.
I met a gal who started FIRE at 15 and she's 21 now.  Her parents are a cab driver and a laundromat manager -- both are poor.  She's 21 with a net worth of close to $1MM, and she dropped out of high school for fuck's sake.
I meet tons of millennials who blow their wad on useless bullshit idiot college degrees with $250,000 in student loans and all I can do is laugh that they're still blowing their wad on uber and grubhub.  Fucking morons deserve to be poor until they're eating dog food at age 60.
Last weekend I met a FIRE kid who is 21, he just bought his third rental property.  He's never made more than $16 an hour at his 9-5 job at the mall, and he rarely breaks $20 an hour driving for Uber on his off hours. But he's now buying his THIRD apartment to rent.  At age 21.  He came from poor loser parents as well.

Bitcoin isn't even 10 years old, there's no point in worrying about people attempting to manipulate the price.
Unlike fiat currency and stocks, it's difficult to manipulate forever as long as more people are coming in and buying and retaining their portion.  Manipulators can't just create more bitcoin out of thin air, so the more folks that believe in bitcoin over time, the more stable the price will likely become over time.
It's still too young.  There are still too many billions of people who don't know about it or haven't touched it.  There's a lot of volatility ahead.
Profit from this by making a habit to buy small amounts each week.  I've been buying 0.015 BTC every week just in 2018.  In 2018 I should acquire an additional 0.75-1 BTC in additional to what I've gotten over the years.  With a cap of 21MM bitcoins total, I'll own a hefty percentage of total supply.

Yeah, that's the more important part, your last sentence -- being on the same page about important stuff.
My current girlfriend is very much like me.  She's more of a fascist about people and way more judgmental in some ways, but it works.  She was also patiently waiting for me to end things with my last girlfriend who was just as amazing for me as the current one, but the last one changed her timing on wanting kids so we ended things -- we were on the same page for a long time but then we weren't.  No big deal, we broke up, we're still very close, and I get to hang out with her awesome kid and amazing husband now.  Same with the gal before her: we were on the same page about important things, but then her biological clock struck.  We're still close friends years later.
But as for maturity, I don't pay much attention to that.  I don't date women who get drunk or high.  I don't date women with tattoos or weird piercing.  I don't date women with debt.  I don't date women with anxiety or depression.
But they're still in their 20s and I'm in my 40s and it works great because we're on the same page regarding the important stuff.
I don't care about their maturity level as long as they're not playing the victim.  That's the only silent secret rule I have, and I don't tell anyone I date about it.
When I was married, I married the absolute worst partner for me.  I accept that responsibility today.  To this day I don't blame her (although most people did and still do).  I blame myself for being a poor leader and picking a terrible match.

You agreed to transfer YOUR money to their responsibility for a period of time.  It isn't your money until that agreement comes to an end.
Why would you violate your agreement?  I mean, it's not that hard to read and understand something before signing it: 
27(A): "I authorize Robinhood Financial, at its discretion and without further prior notice, to utilize an electronic check process or Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) facility to draft funds in the amount of any of My checks payable to Robinhood Financial, its agents or assigns.

If you earn money at a high rate and save/invest it at a high rate, you can purchase real estate to rent much sooner than the 4 year market, which returns better than the stock market if you buy at the correct market ratios.
I've owned real estate since 1991 and I always buy rentals at 60X income but it takes dozens of offers to find a great deal.  I never use a realtor, of course.  My returns on real estate rent minus overhead and taxes is around 23% over 27 years now -- including periods of liquidating real estate because the rental ratio valuation was over 150X rent so I sold and then bought back something cheaper.
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:14:36
Why would you ever invest rent money into anything?  That's ridiculous.  It's a sign of an bad investor.
Instead of investing rent money, invest skip money.  If you don't buy that Starbucks today, send $5 to Coinbase USD Wallet.  If you skip that $50 video game, send $50 to Coinbase USD Wallet.
Then you can switch to GDAX and buy BTC in tiny amounts fee-free with a basic buy market-limit order (no fee transaction).
Little bits every week add up to huge bits over the years.
Daytrading with rent money is ridiculous.  Stop doing that.  I made millions (on paper) over the past 11 years on all my stock and crypto investments by purchasing tiny amounts every day/week/month (dollar-cost average).

This is a stupid question.  Really dumb actually, it shows that you are clueless about how markets work long term.
You can not time the market.  Professionals who think they know better usually end up trailing the slow-and-patient returns of those who never try to time the market.
I've been buying a small amount every week for over 5 years and I have outpaced 100% of my friends who take money out and put it back in thinking they will "profit" but what happens is they never exit at the absolute top and they never buy in at the absolute bottom so they miss all the massive growth in those small chunks.

It really isn't healthy but it's also a sign of having invested more than you can afford to lose.

1. I retired at age 41 with a net worth of between $2MM and $10MM.  I won't say how much since I post on reddit with my real name.
2. I was a consultant but I also worked 2-3 part time jobs, also started up some businesses (many failed), did odd jobs, etc.  I also monetize my homes and cars using sites similar to AirBNB and Turo.
3. Well I had a massively big retail store chain in my 20s and I lost everything due to a 7-figure divorce at age 31.  At age 31 I had $-180,000 net worth, and no money to even turn on the electricity for 5 months.  So I went from $-180,000 to retired in about 10 years.  Some weeks I worked up to 120 hours (not every week but some!) just to meet my retirement goals on-time.
I planned to retire at age 40 but had to work til 41.5 to get to my financial goals.  Now I live on my profits/dividends, I don't sell stocks or bitcoin or anything to live.

I keep between 6-12% of my net worth in bitcoin and I forecast prices of $2500 and $25,000 in my projections.
In either case, it's not enough of my net worth to make a difference, and bitcoin doesn't issue any dividends or profits, so it's just a growth fund.
If bitcoin was a stock, I wouldn't invest in it.  What bitcoin needs is a way to generate dividend yield in the future (maybe owning mining stocks that are really?).

I never said that.  I said don't consume what other men produce for you.  You can have fun doing things you love doing any not paying someone else for the dopamine high.


Wrong, most people are suckers and I make some of my money on what "most people" think is normal.  It's not normal to be forever in debt and go to be with financial anxiety and have to take antidepressants because you want to hurt yourself at least two days a month.


Nah I am just not afraid to say what other producers discuss behind closed doors.  TV addicts are losers.  Foodie addicts are losers.  Addicts are losers -- but we producers profit from loser mentality.  We market these addictions as normal, as "everyone is doing it, don't miss out!"  We're all drug dealers, and we love the profit from it.


Nobody occasionally does that shit.  One of the greatest tricks we the producers play on the world is spreading the idea that "in moderation" is fine.  But you can't moderate addictive activities and behaviors.  The person who thinks they only watch half hour of TV a day actually watches 5 hours a day -- I know, I've read the studies!

In my home town we have a well recognized FIRE club with over 30 "kids" who became millionaires in the past 10-12 years, zero of them with degrees, zero of them with high end jobs.  One kid has a net worth of over $2MM, he's 29, he dropped out of high school at 14 and has never earned more than $35 in an hour working heavy labor jobs, Uber, Instacart, etc.  But his real estate investments now pay him over $80 an hour, every hour of every day of every week.

It's a myth that you need a high income or a degree to be a millionaire young.

More frequent small purchases work better for me.  Dollar-cost averaging.  I don't really care if it goes up, goes down, goes sideways.  When I need it, it'll be there.

Nah, I know a lot of guys with kids who did it just fine.  The key is to not raise your kids like little robots clicking a screen.  It isn't easy but I have so many amazing stories I've personally witnessed.
One dad who I mentored years ago has a 13 year old daughter who is now the landlord on 2 rental properties he bought with her.  She collects rent.  She fixes toilets.  She repaints between renters.  She handles paying the taxes and fees and bills.  She's 13.  At 11 she was a freaking rebellious little bitch who was on her way to being a tattooed porn star in 7 years but her dad saw that she was just bored with life so he involved her in landlording and now she's the main star.  He told me she'll own 5 units by 18 and probably be making $60,000 a year income doing that.  It's amazing to see.
This dad was going the wrong way with his kids because he thought kids need STUFF, they need computers and tablets and broadband and Netflix -- all that stuff just corrupts the mind. 
Great parents involve their kids in wealth building from a young age.  9 year olds can comprehend that turning up heat in winter makes the gas bill more expensive.  Great parents teach their kids that savings $5 today is worth $2600 in 20 years.  Every $5 the kid saves today can be worth $2600 when they're in their 30s and need it most.  Kids can comprehend this.
Bad parents let society/school/TV raise the kids.

You're assuming they're investing in stock markets and not in real estate that they can actively maintain because it's near them.  So keep that in mind.
Also, if they can't make their monthly goal, they have to work more.  That's just a fact.  I worked 120 hours a week some months when I was on my path because I fell short of my goal.  It sucked.  It was a terrible sacrifice, but I retired at 41 because of it.
The tax hit on realized gains is definitely a problem early on until such time that your assets can be incorporated and you can start realizing the real benefit of being wealthy: the tax law only penalizes poor people.  It's a personal income tax problem, not a corporate profit tax problem.  See a tax attorney for more details.


Chicago's biggest FIRE club now has over 110 "kids" under 30 who are all self-made millionaires and can and do prove it because many of them are like me and mentor the next generation.  We don't charge 1 penny for our time.  We don't sell books or CDs.  It's all voluntary mentorship.  That's just the biggest FIRE club.  The FIRE club in my smaller suburb of Chicago has about 30 people in the past decade who went from $0 net worth to over $1MM net worth.  Maybe 5 of these folks (including myself) are mentors to others, the rest just come in to make new friends or share new secrets.
It's a social club, but it's also a school.  There are just no costs involved other than a person proving they can sacrifice 2 years forward to become wealthy in mindset.
The key to FIRE for my programs I am active in is looking for profitable real estate and then acquiring it for cash (no leverage) the minute you have enough to buy something.  I just witnessed a young guy (23!) buy two apartments for under $45,000 each instead of $70,000 because they were both in horrible condition, but he's renting those apartments to younger FIRE kids at a discount and they'll all fix them together.  So he's already profiting from those purchases.  A few years ago, he was worth $0, now he has $90,000 in assets that are producing a profit, and in 2 years he will probably buy 1-2 more for cash when he finds a good deal.
I don't "flip" real estate, I buy it to rent it actively and I only buy it for cash (not on the MLS which is a joke on people with poor math skills, lol).  I even rent my primary residences on airbnb, vrbo, etc.  My primary home costs me $0 a year because it's so popular on the home-sharing apps.  My cost of living in Chicago is less than $0 a year, including housing, food, insurance, property taxes, utilities -- just based on the income my house generates in home sharing.

Most stocks don't issue dividends, that's why they're growth stocks.
I own gold (6% of my net worth is bullion, gold and others) but I also own gold mining shares that pay me quarterly.  I like being on both sides of the market: the consumption of gold and the production of gold.
I'm aware that bitcoin isn't a stock, it's closer to oil or minerals.  I'd love to see MLPs that "mine" and issue a profit.  I invest in MLPs myself, and I don't see a reason why a big miner can't do this down the line -- once things make more sense economically.

I was in acceptable shape in my 20s but alcohol and shit eating were to blame.
I do a lot of mentorship for weight and health -- I've invested tens of thousands of hours helping thousands of guys lose weight using keto to nuke the belly fat and then leangains to get strong and lean.  And I meet 20 year olds all the time when I do film production and many of them (even actors) are out of shape or weak or unhealthy.  


No doubt.  But the problem is that most people are so addicted to their consumer behaviors that they can't start.  Consumerism is the opposite of motivation.  Rampant consumers is addiction.
I probably get 100 messages a week on Reddit from people who ask me how to stay motivated.  If they fill out my questionnaire, almost 95% of them are just consumer addicts, and when I call them out on it they say "Well I can't live without (consumer luxury)."
The reason people are too poor to buy 1 fucking bitcoin is because of this.  Not because they don't earn enough, but because they blow their entire paycheck on useless luxuries, and burn their free time consuming those useless luxuries.
1 BTC is less than $10,000 I'm sure (I haven't checked the price since I last bought last week) which assuming a part time gig bringing in $12 an hour net, you can afford in just 16 hours of work a week for a year.
There's zero excuse for the average Redditor on this sub from the US not to have 1 BTC.   It's one year, one part time job for 16 hours a week.  Drive an Uber or shop for instacart or mow lawns on the weekend.

If it wasn't for MtGox early on, a lot of folks wouldn't have touched Bitcoin when we did.
I didn't trust MtGox (I'm on record publicly over this) but I'd say 99% of the people I know who recognized bitcoin early on and marketed it to others (causing the network effect) got in because MtGox made it easier.
I'd say BitPay and Coinbase were part of that, too, early on -- because vendors didn't have a payment network and most ecommerce solutions didn't work with Bitcoin.

"We" don't need to do anything.  Governments can try all they want to censor things -- but no censorship mandates work.  If anything, they just create new ways for people to find routes around it.
The bitcoin "objectionable content" FUD is just FUD.  Nobody who is spreading objectionable content is going to put it on the bitcoin blockchain because it's too complicated and costly and has no audience.
Also, I don't take a moral opinion on what other people do -- criminal or otherwise.  I certainly don't want a government to enforce morals or individual rights.  If criminals want to commit crimes, I won't personally get involved with them.  If they try to commit a crime against me or my property, I will defend myself.

I retired at age 41 -- not because of bitcoin but because this is basically what I've done over 24 years of investing (plus the 2.5 years of retirement) and it's worked beautifully.
The only markets I time are dividend yielding markets.  Growth funds never made sense to try to time.
Dividend yielding vehicles are easier to time -- if the yield is too low compared to the asset price, you sell it.  If the yield is too high compared to the asset price, you buy it.  Growth funds have no profit yield so you can't use those metrics.

Yeah, I know I sold about $2 million worth of bitcoin in my life, but I didn't *need* to wait it out to be $2 million because when I did sell my BTC, I bought other things of value (commercial real estate, gold, a sailboat, a vacation condo, etc).  The $2 million in paper means shit to me.
Bitcoin is one of 9 hedges I own in my portfolio.  I'm 43.  Right now my hedges aren't going to be called in until I am 65 or older (likely).
So if bitcoin is $10,000 or $2000 or $50,000, I don't give a shit.  I'll keep buying $100-$150 a week, every week, until I get to age 65 or older.

I don't know if I'm a good role model for kids.  I'm a good role model for rebels, though.
My entire mindset I teach others is to find out if you are meant to be powerful, and then aim for power.  I teach people not to worry about society that refuses to worry about themselves.  I can not help a poor person who refuses to acknowledge WHY they are poor and why they continue to be poor.

I have no hate for the poor.  I love the poor.  Imagine an entire 80% of society who can not stop spending and daydreaming but they work 40-60 hours a week for $0 net worth growth.  That means that 80% of society grinds themselves to the bone VOLUNTARILY to enrich guys like me.  **I love the poor**.  I want to see them have more "freedom" to buy more $200 pairs of sneakers and $30 avocado toast.  Hell, I want to build more hospitals and colleges for them to be distracted with.


Do you think the average rich person you know will actually tell you that they're happy you are a poor grunt who enriches them?  Of course not.  I'm one of the few honest people in the world.


Read Pareto.  These are not problems.  This is nature working as nature intended.  I support nature.  You can't "fix" what isn't broken.


I was in some of the "poorest" neighborhoods in America, Africa, and Asia in the past 2 years.  I've seen how much crap the poor people buy with their meager incomes.  They refuse to save because as soon as they see their neighbor buy some plastic bullshit, they want it, too.  Go spend a few weeks on and see the number of morons who continue to live like there's no tomorrow.  It's amazing.


You can't fix that.  The market and nature fixes it.  There are millions of powerful people on the planet today who came from dirt poverty 1-2 generations ago.  Millions.
If a poor person wants to be powerful, they have to shit on their people.  Guys like Kanye (who I mentioned) shat on his race and class to become powerful.  He sells those grunts $200 sneakers and $100 perfumes, lol.  Smart fucking guy.
Look at anyone who came out of poverty -- the products they sell are marketed to the poor people to make them think they're not poor.
I love nature.  I love the market.  Bitcoin is just one more weapon for me to build wealth on the backs of the poor who voluntarily stay there.

One can never become a slave to one's ego because in the entire universe you are the only person who exists.
There's no purpose in love based on how the modern system (media and social norms) have destroyed the hormonal capacity to properly value survival traits in others.  Today's "love" is about feelings, not survival traits.  I value survival traits in others.

You think people have more access to health and education?  Are you serious?
Do you realize that most of the numbskulls with a degree have one in "business" or "marketing" or "fashion/filmmaking" which are all bullshit make-work studies.  They also have 5-6 figures of debt held by guys like me who invest in SLABS for profit.  And they can't file bankruptcy, lol.
Health?  Look around you.  The average person on reddit is shaped like a vat of death potatoes.  There's no health anymore, there is only "health care" which means free insulin and ADD drugs -- more shit to keep you under control.  I'm invested in health care companies so I support this ideal.
The average person has no more freedom than they did 2000 years ago.  Unless by freedom you mean "more bars to visit" or "more brands of 120hz 72 inch OLED monitors".
Bitcoin's lack of infinite inflation looks great for the poor, certainly.  The problem is that the poor will still spend more than they make.  Bitcoin's lack of infinite inflation has one amazing side effect: when people take loans in bitcoin, they end up never being able to pay them back because the valuation increase of bitcoin over time means they will never catch up.  We will hopefully return to the days of debtors prisons.
The average numbskulls reading this has NO positive net worth at all -- not only are they worthless, they are BELOW worthless.  Instead of cheering low prices of bitcoin, the average grunt here wants it to go up to $100,000 which means guys like me will continue to be able to afford to buy, but they won't.
The poor deserve to be poor because they work hard to stay poor.
If you don't have 2.1 BTC by this point, you will never get to 0.5 BTC in your life.  Period.  You will be forever poor, and those of us who have 2.1 BTC or more will continue to buy more and more over time.  Then we will lend it out to miscreants with "business marketing" degrees and when they can't pay us back, we'll own their offspring.

It's weird how people think inflation is a bad thing.  During periods of the highest inflation, you should be working because consumers are spending!  Don't be buying shit like houses and OLED TVs -- put your time to work since people are spending.

Greedy and selfish is called human nature.
I've been buying bitcoin every week since 2012.  Dollar cost averaging.  I try to keep bitcoin at 6% of my net worth and generally don't sell unless it exceeds 12% during my quarterly rebalancing targets.  I've sold bitcoin 3 times in 5.5 years -- at $900, $3300 and in the $18,000 range.  
So every week I buy a small amount, typically around $125 average.  I retired 3 years ago at age 41 and have been buying $125 a week as usual, but as of last quarter (ending March 31, 2018) I realized my passive income is about double what I expected, so I am doubling my bitcoin purchases to $250 a week, every week.
I am not living off of bitcoin profits, I just want to acquire more.  
Since most people on this sub don't even have $100 in BTC, there's no point in wanting it to keep going up if you want to acquire more.
$5000 would be nice right now.

I've lived poverty twice.  Once by being born to poverty, and once because I was a slacker and lost 7 figures in net worth.  In either case, I was poor because my parents were slackers.  They worked very hard but they tried to live like the neighbors did -- the very neighbors who were also slackers.
I spend a lot of time in poor countries and the people I befriend there are always the ones who struggle to succeed instead of putting shit off for tomorrow.
Everyone who has 2 working hands and 2 working feet and an IQ over 80 can be wealthy if they wanted to.  But not everyone can be wealthy at the same time.
Only 20% of society is destined for power.  This is true of ANY society.  Pareto shows it's true under communism and capitalism and socialism and feudalism.
If you want to be wealthy, bitcoin is just one tiny part of it.  I retired at age 41.  I've invested in bitcoin since 2012.  Bitcoin only accounts for 6% of my wealth.  It's not a lot.  It's a tiny part.
The biggest reason I am wealthy is because I don't volunteer myself to poverty.  I am retired young with a lot of money but I can't afford cable TV or high speed internet.  I have a small home, I may be a multimillionaire but I can't afford a big fancy home.  I don't go out to restaurants more than once a month because I can't afford it, but I have millions.  My phone is some 4" iPhone from years ago, it's ancient.  I only get 1GB of data a month. Why?  I can't afford a nicer phone or unlimited data, even though I am wealthy.
I live within my means.  People who have $0 net worth here on Reddit blow money on video games and broadband and iPhone X and all sorts of bullshit and then they want a handout from me?
Fuck them.  Fuck every single asshole reading this who can't afford to buy bitcoin but spends $120 a month on internet.  What a piece of shit that guy is.

Why would it matter?  If you shorted bitcoin, you don't have to cover your shorts just because the price went up -- if the price falls again before your cover deadline, you can still make a killing shorting a stock or asset.
I've shorted bitcoin twice in the past 5 years using the same method: I borrow actual bitcoin from a friend with a promise to return exactly that amount of bitcoin by a certain date.
I then sell the actual bitcoin for cash.  Then I wait until I can buy back bitcoin cheaper than I sold it for.  If the deadline for me is 90 days to pay them back (in bitcoin), I can buy back bitcoin any time the price drops below what I sold it for, return the bitcoin, keep the cash difference.
Price volatility before my strike price doesn't matter.

This is why people who are only invested in one asset are poor investors generally -- and why those of us with balanced portfolios typically do well with volatility.
I've been using a "rebalance without usually selling" portfolio action for 26 years, including bitcoin since 2012.  I dollar cost average weekly into my portfolio, shoring up whatever is the weakest as a percentage of my portfolio.  In situations where one particular market gets extremely volatile, I will have to sell down that asset to rebalance.
I've only had to sell bitcoin thrice in those 5ish years -- once at $900, once just under $3000, and once at the end of December 2018.  Each time, my crypto 6% position was way over 12%, so I sold down to 6% to rebalance my portfolio and used the profits to shore up other positions.
Naturally I always continue to buy-in weekly (dollar cost average style) and 2018 hasn't really been that bad in crypto to be honest.  Yeah, my 2018 positions are down around 11% right now overall, but that's not really much of a problem because as the price falls (versus my entire portfolio), I buy more crypto during the low points, which has offset some of the earlier losses as a percentage of portfolio growth/loss.
I don't look at my non-fiat positions as money I am owed, until I cash out, which right now is either 20 years away, or whenever some position I have goes too heavy and I liquidate to rebalance.  Which in 5ish years happened just 3 times.
OP is a reason why I've had solid returns for 26 years -- lots of suckers trying to make money quickly, but those of us who are patient are making even more money, just slower.

You should be cautious.  There are tons of FUD accounts on the web -- some of them run entire popular crypto blogs that people rely on -- because marketing reverse pressure means that the mental midgets will move the market in a direction that smarter people can strike at.
There are hundreds of well seeded accounts on twitter and FB and reddit and other places that exist solely to move price in a reverse direction momentarily.  It doesn't cost anything to manage these accounts and if you can get 1% slippage, it's enough to profit from.
BTC is a bit more difficult to manipulate this way, but all the other cryptos are happily pushing profits to the marketing moguls.
FUD is just marketing.

The sellers use other fake accounts to create 100% positive reviews.  They'll also do 2-3 real transactions for a few real reviews.
Then they scam someone out of $500 or whatever.
I'm not 100% sure how the scam works but I believe there's some timing method at Western Union.  Basically the scammer sits at Western Union, makes the transfer legit, you send the bitcoin and they already have the reversal/cash-out ready to go at WU so you can't actually get your cash.
Again, I'm not sure what the exact scam method is, but it's legit a scam.
Never sell BTC for Western Union, ever.  Just don't.

My parents both came to America on boats with $100 or so to their names -- my dad from Asia, mom from communist Europe.  I was poor all my childhood.  Mom is constantly in preforeclosure to this day because she refuses to be rich.  Dad lives in a 2 bedroom apartment and also refuses to be rich.


There is no "greater good".  It's a zero sum game and if some people want to voluntarily be poor, then others need to work hard to be rich.
There's no broken system here.  We've known the rule of wealth for 2000-3000 years.  It's possible we knew the rules of wealth before that, as well.  Inflation isn't anti-poor, it's pro-wealth.  If you want to profit from inflation, the tools have existed for at least 150 years to do so.

I own retail stores (and expanding).  We accept Bitcoin and do a small amount of transactions, so far.  It takes no time, and we already offer 0-confirmation transaction approval if it is under $250.  As long as my staff can see them performing the payment, it's good enough (for now).
I also consult with local businesses on Bitcoin acceptance, and the 3 biggest issues for acceptance are:
1. Distrust of the currency from a regulatory/tax perspective.  This is tough: if you accept Bitcoin, do you value your income as the USD price at transfer, or the USD value upon conversion (if you cash out) or the USD value upon tax payment?
2. Distrust of Bitcoin from a legitimacy perspective.  "Won't the FBI come knocking?" I hear from ALL business owners.
3. Insufficient time at current value.  People who do a casual search on Bitcoin see the value all over the place, and fear they'll see thousands of dollars in value disappear overnight.
That being said, I have answers to all 3.  So far, though, I've only helped a few businesses start accepting it, and none of them publicly.
We aren't even crawling yet, forget about walking.  I have faith and logical sense that 2014 will be the year we take our first steps, as a legitimate currency.

If I give a BTC$10 wallet to a friend to cover my bill, he keeps his BTC usually rather than liquidating it.
There are two types of merchants who accept BTC:
1. Merchants who hold their balances
2. Merchants who immediately convert their balances to fiat (using a payment processor usually)
I only try to deal with  for now.

It's a fine question, but my answer continues to be that economies dependent on credit will continue to have booms and busts that come with the business cycle of malinvestment.
Bitcoin users (not speculators) seem to quickly realize the benefits of saving wisely versus spending uselessly.
I'm hopeful that bitcoin creates a better economy for those who are part of it, and let the inflation supporters have their plunging money if they prefer it.

Many people are trying to do this, but banking regulations prevent it at the moment.
Years ago, I looked into having a bank that denominated balances in gold micrograms.  You deposit cash, and we convert it to micrograms on deposit, and convert back to cash if we have to redeem payments over the Visa network.
The Feds told me no, repeatedly, for years.
It's a great idea (in either direction), but old banking cartels have incredible control.

The issue is that Alice can't loan Bob $500 and still think she has $500 to herself.  She doesn't
The bank loans money that it also owes to someone else **who can still withdraw that money**.
If Alicen loaned Bob $500 and then decided she can still spend $500, she's counterfeiting.  That's fraudulent and it's theft.

I think it's very related to what you were saying.
Right now, it's about near monopolies who have the financial power to invest in profitable mining hardware at the expense of others.
But those monopolies certainly aren't massive groups who have some benefit outside of the block rewards.  Business owners who rely on bitcoin ARE a massive group, and don't need the block rewards as a reason to maintain a strong and neutral network.
5000 miners seeking block rewards versus 50,000 business owners who need a neutral and safe network for themselves and their customers?
No contest.

I'm not saying it's a terrible idea, though.  I just am against the overall premise of a flat affiliate commission.
I think there are ways that bitcoin merchant processors CAN pay a commission, but the common "PPA" affiliate commission would be costly.
Now, if you sign up a merchant that does US$10,000 a month in bitcoin sales, I can understand paying a $50 or $100 commission...

In my businesses, we are HEAVY labor intensive.  Even in my t-shirt businesses, labor is more expensive than goods (in volume).
Because I've found ways to be more efficient than my competitors, I have a pretty strong margin in most of my businesses.

You're obviously an idiot (or something like it) because you haven't explained how that exchange will pay for the service you're demanding.
Explain it.
Explain how a business who can't steal from the public will afford to pay for enough customer service representatives during a time of great acceleration in interest in their market.
Please, I'm waiting for you to explain it.
Coinbase knows something you're being obtuse about: the bitcoin market is being swamped with possibly millions of people emailing bitcoin businesses inquiring about it.  I know, I'm a bitcoin business and I get PHONE CALLS TO MY PERSONAL CELL PHONE from imbeciles I don't even know.  Every day.  I get emails to my customer service accounts asking me what bitcoin is, how people can make money with it, etc.
Coinbase can not hire people for this rush only to fire them in a month.  Training new employees is farking expensive.  Can cost 5 months of salary overhead.  Forget that.
If you are so wise and so smart about having an answer, then compete.  Open an exchange!  I'll send you $10,000 of my money tomorrow if you do.  Hire thousands of people to answer 250,000 emails a day (5000 CSRs can handle about 50 emails a day on average).  If it jump to 500,000 emails a day, just double your CSRs!  No problem, right?
Just do it if you're so smart, if you have all the answers.  It sounds like there's a huge market just waiting to use your perfect service.
My $10,000 is waiting, ready to be ACH'd to your perfect exchange tomorrow.

Imagine you're a waiter and you want to accept tips using a QR code.  Right now, anyone who tips you can see how many tips you've had, or what your balance is in total.
With a feed-and-rotate QR code, no one would be the wiser.  They'd just scan your F/R QR, get a new address, send the tip, and be done.  Just as fast as scanning a fixed wallet address QR, but with more privacy and merchant trackability.

An exchange absolutely has to be a full reserve bank.
Consider this:  If 10,000 people sent the exchange $1 each, do you think it's cool for the exchange to buy only $5,000 worth of bitcoin and pocket the rest, and only redeem bitcoin to customers on demand?  
Of course not.
If people buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin, they're going to want access to $10,000 worth of bitcoin.  That's full reserve banking.
Now, if 10,000 people each deposit $1 into the fiat bank, not all 10,000 are going to immediately withdraw their money again.  They figure it's safe at the bank, so they'll just charge on their debit cards what they need to in the future.  The bank, thanks to federal laws, only has to store $1000 or even $500 of that $10,000 for customers.  The bank then can take the other $9500 and loan it to whoever needs money.
If for some reason customers demand more than $500 in reserve, the bank can borrow from the Federal Reserve to pay those customers, even though the $9500 is all loaned out.  That's fractional reserve banking.
And I don't have a short attention span, I am a contrarian and I hate seeing people who can't accept reality.  I hate this "consumer is always right" mindset.  Consumers are never right, if they were, they wouldn't be consuming, they'd be producing.

Consider this:  Right now, your boss(es) see your value to them as MORE than $8 an hour.  That's why they pay you $8 an hour -- they need to profit on you to stay in business and get a good return.
Ask yourself: "How can I make myself more valuable to others?"  The answer?  People will pay for something that saves them time and money.
I could mow my lawn (2 hours?) but that means I wouldn't be able to do work at (say) $150 an hour.  So if I paid someone less than $300 to do it, it's a savings.

I get the mining question 15-20 times a day from people.  I've always been a "show people why things are bad instead of telling them", so I decided to invest $1500 of my own money for 120 days to prove that mining offers no return, but a lot of fun.
I'm [blogging about it here]( and created a pretty nice Google Doc Spreadsheet (link within) where I show a fair estimate that my 2BTC I invested will likely barely reach 1.3 BTC through June.  And that is making assumptions that there won't be an insane increase in difficulty.
I knew I would probably lose 25% of my BTC during this example, but it's less costly than having to explain to 15-20 people a day that mining is NOT for profit, it's for benevolently supporting the network, and for entertainment.

I do have a feeling that December 31st will be a falling BTC price specifically because I know a few people with large holdings who are waiting until the last moment to liquidate.  But I think you get my drift.

I'm a retailer, and I believe our merchant account rules were updated this or last year to allow us to put a minimum transaction amount.
Edit: [Yep, Federal law change in US](
At my store, we do a lot of small transactions ($4-6).  We don't have a minimum, but we have a request that people pay an additional $1 to cover transactions.  I would say that MOST people just end up buying something additional, understanding that on a $4 purchase, we have to pay our clerk about $1 in time, $2 in COGS, and $0.50 in transaction fees.

I run a variety of ecommerce websites, and bitcoin sales traffic hasn't slowed down EVER.  Not when prices go up, not when prices go down, not when they stabilize.  If anything, my bitcoin sales have been consistently moving up -- and from new customers (not just repeats).
Here's how I see it:
1. Spending some bitcoin means the M(v) -- the velocity of money -- accelerates.  This is good for any economy.
2. Purely staking your investment growth on hoping for "new suckers" is risky -- once you run out of new investors, or once previous investors decide to take profits at the same time, there will be fewer buyers and the price will fall.
3. Hoarding bitcoin temporarily removes that bitcoin from the economy, which due to supply and demand keeps the price high, but only because of the temporary hoarding.  Spending bitcoin can keep the price high by creating a more realistic demand for it -- valued demand.
The question gets asked constantly: what if a billionaire/government bought all the bitcoin?  The price would skyrocket, then it would plummet.  The more people that demand bitcoin, the more valuable the current price is.
As a seller of goods and services for bitcoin, I created [the Bitcoin Oath]( for other vendors to consider.  It states that a vendor won't just convert your spent BTC to fiat tomorrow, except if they need it for supplies, utility/rentor payroll.  At the very least, a bitcoin vendor should consider keeping their PROFITS in BTC, and then looking for ways to spend their profits and even overhead BTC on other BTC accepting vendors.
I'm a landlord -- my tenants can pay me in BTC.  I sell goods, my customers can pay me in BTC and I will spend that BTC on my one employee who accepts it, or on one of 2 Chinese ink suppliers who accept it, or in the local economy with tab sharing with friends, etc.  I don't just have BitPay send me dollars tomorow.
M(v) matters in keeping the price high.  Hoarding is a temporary way to keep the price high.

There are some people doing this already.  Remember that the price fluctuations can put a BIG damper in your plans.
If you want to arbitrage, make sure you have a LOT of capital above and beyond the $1500 you want to arbitrage with.  Buy, transfer, sell -- but you might need MORE money to re-buy if the sold portion doesn't clear fast enough.
**Edit**: You're putting a lot of money up for a $41 profit.  How much is your time worth?

Well, it's more about getting an accurate count of real interest.
I produced live concerts for years for unknown bands.  They always wanted to do free shows.  I told them that's a bad idea.  If you charge $2 a ticket, people will feel invested enough to show up.  No one wants to go to a free show, there's no investment.

The biggest block, 271013, had 1095 transactions.  It took 14 minutes.

For people to be aware of problems, we have to experience some.
inputs.io is evidence not to use a wallet someone else controls.  Good experience that others will learn from.
Bitcoin will likely be the reason why a P2P feedback system will be created.  Imagine not being able to just start a new eBay account or sell junk on Amazon because people won't trust 0 P2P feedback accounts.  Vendors will cling to their long term feedback when it's used everywhere.
Escrow will allow for people to protect themselves AT THEIR OWN OPTIONAL COST.  Competitive escrow services, even.

I wonder how this rule would be attributed to holding BTC at different exchanges.
For example
Exchange A: Buy 5 BTC @ $100 in July
Exchange B: Buy 5 BTC @ $200 in August
Exchange B: Sell 5 BTC @ $300 in September
So I assume based on the rule, the gains are $300-$100 x 5 = $1000, even though you're selling the NEWER BTC, not the older ones.

Google my username.  I work for one person: myself.
**Edit**: And the solution isn't to hire more customer service people, but to create a platform and process that is so smooth and easy to use that no one will ever inquire about a problem.
And that is what Coinbase and many competitors of theirs works on daily.  That's the end goal: a smooth, transparent, flawless transaction for customers.
But, bitcoin is an unknown.  While they're all working to provide you with a simple system, they're also having to consult with lawyers and accountants to make sure things are legal, and the legal framework changes often enough.
They also have to monitor ever-changing banking regulations, deal with ACH hiccups (ACH is a nightmare, look it up) and make sure that their buys and sells on their exchange go perfectly timed or they'll be out of a LOT of money if there's a 10% swing in price seconds after a customer clicks "buy" or "sell".
Coinbase is doing something you don't have the balls to do, or you would do it yourself.
Go.  Go do it.  Compete. Create an exchange. Try it.

If 100% of middle class people had equal shares, [they would each only have]( about $9 at today's value.
If even 10% of middle class people bought in, that's still only $90 at today's value.  I would guess that anyone holding bitcoin would want a lot more than $90 worth.
Consider that.  If just 10% of the middle class in the world had bitcoin, and they valued it at (say) $1000, that would mean a 1100% price increase from here.

The point of confirmation is to make sure the person isn't spending a balance they've already spent before.
Once it's transfered, it's gone.
There's a SMALL option to try to double spend it with a higher transaction fee if caught in time, but if someone is sweeping your wallet, I don't think they're going to do it with a 0 fee transaction.

My businesses aren't hampered by short term losses -- I've baked in more than enough streams of income that I can take risks that other competitors can't.
I came up with this price guarantee idea 4 months ago and actually have run the numbers.  Even with the massive value increase in the past 2 months, my total "loss" would not have been significant -- I'm not giving them cash, and my average orders are below $45.
At worst, a guy who spent $45 in BTC only to see it rise to $105 in value is getting a $60 gift certificate.  It won't wipe me out by any means, since bitcoin barely accounts for 15% of sales.  So in that situation, my cost per order loss might be 25% of gross.
It's a gimmick to get bitcoin holders on the fence to actually spend them.  I might not keep it around forever, and if I see something bad come up, I end it for new customers and just guarantee the previous 30 days of sales.
I do appreciate the warning, tho!

As someone who cherishes what Rothbard taught about money, I support competitive currencies -- government currencies, private corporate currencies ("Amazon gift cards"), local community currencies and public ledger decentralized cryptocurrencies.
All of them bring value to the market, and some of them actually bring competitive pressures to the weaker ones.
In my opinion, a strong competitive market for cryptocoins should eliminate the foulness of government centralized banking.  That's my end goal.

Gold and silver have been my salvation from overspending like ALL of my peers.  100% of them use their easy credit and inflationary dollars to overbuy and get into debt.
I've forced myself to save by purchasing something with low liquidity in easy purchases by high liquidity in emergencies.  I've only sold gold/silver for fiat 2 times in my life -- definitely financial emergencies.
With bitcoin's increased liquidity, it's a bit tougher for me to use it as a form of savings -- but making an offline wallet is a huge huge help there.
Still, I won't stop buying 5-10% of each paycheck in bullion.  I am currently in India for a week (bitcoin negotiation tour!), and it's evident that gold and silver will hold value for much of the world for a very, very long time.
But I am not a gold bug anymore.  I'm a saver, a hoarder, and gold is an easy thing to hoard.

Define "worth it".  It's a term that means different things to different people.
When people tell me they can afford practically nothing, I generally call them out on it.  If you're not earning enough, earn more (we live in a world of endless opportunity).  If you're spending on things you don't need to live, your priorities are elsewhere.  If you're in heavy debt, negotiate out of it.  Lots of options -- one's priorities are what matters.
Bitcoin can go "to the moon" or it can crash to $0.  Your risk level is different that my risk level.  I take huge calculated risks a few times a year.  5 out of 7 of those risks go to $0.  1 out of 7 makes a huge profit.  1 out of 7 breaks even.  And I'm good at calculating risk!

The problem is that the "leaders" of the feminist movement paint themselves with a harsh brush.
I've lost family and loved ones to the ugly life points that feminism has indoctrinated young women into.  They find themselves 31 years old with no one wanting them -- and them not wanting anyone inferior to their own successes.
I've dated prominent feminists, though -- but usually they have to hide their traditional gender behavior they exude when they're with me.  Weird conundrum.

I never said that at all.  I said that RIGHT NOW we're going through all sorts of pains -- not just "shitty service".  I've gotten great service from 100% of the businesses others condemn here, including GOX.  I also just got amazing service from Chicago's Ventra bus contractor, over the phone, at lunch time, on a weekday.  My patience means I don't get easily pissed at CSRs and companies overwhelmed due to a temporary blip of overdemand.
| If they can't afford to operate their service well, they deserve to go out of business - not continue limping along because they set rates by plucking figures out of the air or going with what the competition went with or whatever, without figuring out their costs and margins.
Yes, if competition provides better product at the same price, or equal product at a better price.  Why doesn't the OP go and open an exchange if he's so wise?
| Your argument basically amounts to "if you don't like getting ripped off, fuck off" which is off-the-charts idiocy.
No, what I said is "if you can't stand the heat, get out of the frying pan".  The bitcoin economy will only get better with time, and when the risk goes away, the reward won't be as lovely.
| we were talking about scrutiny, not expected service(s).
I can't scrutinize the OP because he's anonymous. For all I know, he bitches at McDonalds for not serving filet mignon.
20+ years in business, and I know the type.  High demands for service, high demands for low price, high demands for quality.  In the non-bitcoin market, you can't expect all 3.  In the bitcoin market, be thankful for even 1 of the 3.

It isn't in my interest to give explanations out to people who aren't piqued by a more opaque declaration.

I'm against this, to be honest.  Bitcoin is VERY attractive to people right now, and neither company needs to pay for additional marketing.
Those affiliate commissions cost everyone money in higher fees.  More bitcoin merchants does not necessarily equal a more efficient merchant processor.
My websites that offer affiliate commissions have to increase the price per purchase by almost 6% gross.  That's hefty.  If these companies had to pay a commission, I can't imagine the complaints we'd have about fees.

Offering a discount isn't a realistic way to give people incentive against value increases.  I did a 10% discount for awhile but it wasn't considered very valuable.
Since there can be 30% volatility in a single three day period, I am guaranteeing against any volatility within a longer period of time.
My option allows people to take a risk themselves (pull the trigger when they want to, risking future possible gains), it offers reduced risk against the price going up tomorrow, and it drives people to remember my sites after a purchase.
I see it as win-win for everyone.

One has to remember:
1. the value of Bitcoin is on an upward trend
2. Many people find it difficult to acquire bitcoin for fiat
These 2 issues combined make people want to sit on their bitcoin (hoping it becomes more valuable) rather than spend it.
It is going to be this way for some time.  When bitcoin is easy to buy instantly for everyone, people will be more willing to do a quick buy-and-spend.
For now, they'd rather sit on balances since they feel the balances might be worth more in two weeks.

And in Q1 2014 I'll have even better announcements.

It depends on your insurance policy.
Recently, I helped a friend get their entire car engine replaced ($14,000) when their mechanic told them their car is trashed.  Deductible? $500.
I had a laptop damaged at a friend's house.  Expensive display cracked.  Their homeowner's insurance covered it -- zero deductible.
A few years ago, my wallet was stolen with some gift cards in there that had a lot of value.  I didn't have the gift cards, but I had receipts proving I had them.  My renter insurance covered it minus $100 or something.  They just gave me a check for $466 (the balance, I estimated) and my rates didn't even go up.

This isn't going to end well if their balance wallets aren't secured REALLY well.  I wonder what their background check procedure is for dealing with the guys who maintain the private keys.
Copy the key, walk out the door for the weekend, never be seen again.  Poof.
**Addition**: What's interesting is that they may never have to sell BTC, ever.  If someone wants to liquidate their position, they're selling STOCK in bitcoin share ownership.  So the trust just takes their position and sells it to a new shareholder.
If the trust ever needs MORE bitcoins due to buyers &gt; sellers, then they can buy from an exchange.

I've had a dozen sales today on one of my websites paid in BTC.  That's been my trend lately, and it keeps going up.
When it gets really high, people seem to buy more to "burn off" some profits and get something cool for "cheap".  And then a few weeks later, it stabilizes and I have a decent chunk of BTC more than before.
I can't complain.  When I first started the site, items were selling for 1 BTC.  Now they're selling for 0.03 BTC or so.  Hilarious to consider that difference from my end.

1000 is an arbitrary number based in USD.
In the past month, foreign purchases have skyrocketed -- even Polish PLN sales are accelerating.
No one has a crystal ball.  Many people have waited for the price to fall back to US$100, where it was not even a month ago, and then they come here to whine about how they tried to time the market and utterly failed.
Go ahead and wait if you like.  Just don't come back here in 2 weeks and say "wow, I should have bought at US$800."
If you can properly time the market, you'd be a billionaire tomorrow just buying selling on minute-by-minute volatility.
Admit it: you want comfort in making a risky purchase.  You won't find it here.  Plenty of people have made a fortune, and plenty of people have lost a fortune.  Every 0.01 BTC you buy is because someone else wants to get rid of it.  Consider that, don't take risks you can't afford to lose on, and welcome to the club.

To put it simply:
Credit cards are considered "reversible" transactions.
Bitcoins are considered "irreversible" transactions.
If you try to make an exchange, the party who can reverse the transaction at little to no cost will cost the irreversible party all their assets.
All it takes is a person buying with a credit card to tell their bank that the charge was fraudulent (even if it wasn't).  Then the seller is out their bitcoin AND the money value.
If you want your own bitcoin, sell something on BitMit.net or sell something personally on Craigslist for BTC.

I've posted publicly about PorcFest.  Up to and including how much I lost in trying to foster a risky investment there.  SOME people got some product, some people got fucked, but I was trying to give it all away, at little to no cost.
Until my lawyers engaged me and said I have to be cautious.  Specifically because there were few people putting their names on the line.  Everyone was using fake names and noms de plume but me.
So I lost $15,000 of my own cash that I had budgeted for that event.  I lost 3 employees over it and closed up that entire company (about a $30,000 investment over 2 years).  My girlfriend at the time broke up with me because I was a stress pit.
I've committed to trying to reimburse you, but as of yet, no one I am working with wants to commit to helping me out, and I surely don't have the fundage to just cut you a check.
You're one of 3 people I "owe" something to.  **You never paid me a cent, ever**, remember.  So go ahead and post all our emails and chats.  All of them.  Seriously.  Post it all -- on a blog, link to my name, and spread the word.
After you do that, I believe the general public will vindicate me, because I was dealing with someone anonymous enough, and I was warned by more than a few people not to engage in the group or the individual I was dealing with.
Lesson learned now.  I only donate my time and money and reputation to people who put their real legal names on the line as well.

Yep, the price of any good or service is based on 4 values:
1. Supply of money to be spent on good or service
2. Supply of good or service 
3. Demand for a good or service at a certain price
4. Demand for a certain amount of money from someone who has a good or service to sell

I got lucky over 3 days to be up 10% in BTC.
If you click to my blog and then click to the google doc spreadsheet itself, at the bottom I show an estimate of how much each Gh/s share will need to cost for me to break even.
I update the spreadsheet about once a day, and while it's a bit confusing to take in, I've added hover notes to many fields to explain what I'm doing.
Overall, I think there is money to be made on that site through day trading -- as they spend more on marketing, lots of newbies will come in and possibly raise the share price.
Hard to say, of course, but it definitely is fun to think that I'm helping 0.0000066% of the network at an estimated cost of 0.003 BTC per day or so.
Expensive but not any more than all the other things I spend money on to help the economies I depend on for income.

The ultimate medium of exchange is merely one that allows us to properly price a good we want to sell, or a good we want to buy.  The medium itself isn't the important part.
I have 144 eggs, you have cow's milk, John has a hammer.  Without a medium of exchange, it is really difficult for the 3 of us to transact.
The medium of exchange is "neutral" once it is accepted as being a good medium (fungible, recognizable, hard to counterfeit, divisible, easily transported/transferred/stored, etc).  I might offer 12 eggs for that hammer, or the hammer might be worth 1 gallon of milk.  Or, we can agree on the medium of exchange to present value.
As society creates more eggs, more hammers, more cow's milk, the rarity of bitcoin should allow it to be worth more and more -- there will only be 21 million bitcoins, but there might be billions of eggs, or gallons of milk, or hammers.  So the value of bitcoin should naturally fluctuate against all things, including other currencies, solely due to supply and demand curves.

That's what my spreadsheet showed me.
On the flip side, arbitrage should be encouraged to bring markets tighter to each other.
I'm sure there are players developing arbitrage bots as we speak -- as long as the profit margin &gt; exchange/trade fees, the bots could be mighty productive in such a high volatility environment.  Have the bots include some risk management (extend a delay if there are more buys than sells on the selling side versus the buying side, etc) options, and you could probably make some money.
I would guess, without any way to offer citation or evidence, that the maximum outlay on an aggregate bankroll would be under 6%.  So calculate your arbitrage profit based on that.  Say there's a 10% difference between exchanges ($70) and your bankroll is 2BTC total, segregated into 1BTC and $700 in fiat.  700 * 6% = $42, 10% arbitrage opportunity minutes exchange fees means you'd be looking at a whopping $3 profit.  No thanks.
Now if you can play with 200 BTC bankroll, I'd say do it.  Low risk.

Bitcoin goes up against a government currency when people as a group feel that it is worth more than the specific government currency they are holding.
Bitcoin goes down against a government currency when people feel bitcoin is worth less than the government currency they want to hold.
It is possible for bitcoin to go up against one currency but down against another, since currencies also fluctuate against each other.
If someone has 5000 BTC but they want to buy a car tomorrow for a government currency as payment, they'll sell 5000 BTC today.  Buyers may not be available to buy 5000 BTC at the current rate, so lower bidding buyers will be needed -- pushing the price down against that currency.
Simple market forces.  The fact that there is liquidity in both directions is a good thing: it creates value.
Volatility is also not a bad thing because hedge investors are attracted to volatility and can bring a sort of equilibrium to prices over time.

On top of all of that, mass consumption is on an upward trend but it's still pretty miserable.
What did we see recently, that there are only 11 million wallets with balances?  And people have multiple addresses.  If that figure is 1MM people with balances (I'm making this up), that's not a lot of people involved, and it is also a small enough figure that manipulations can and do happen.
That being said, if the figure goes from 1MM to 10MM by end of 2014, then there's a LOT of room for the price to move upwards, or stabilize where it's at.
10MM people each owning a piece of 12MM shares of BTC...  $800 still seems high to me.  1MM people each owning a piece of 12MM shares of BTC seems very unrealistic.
The price needs to get to the point where the big holders start liquidating into the hands of the new wallet owners.  Then I'll have more faith in such high prices.

Since I use electrum for one of my offline wallets, it isn't very difficult to transfer from cold offline storage to my online hot wallets if I need to make a big purchase.

blockchain.info is free, mind you.
I've noticed something pretty annoying with bitcoin users in the year I've bartered with it and accepted it at my companies: cheapness.
People don't seem to understand that business exist to make a profit.  They stay in business by maintaining a product that works for most and by providing service commensurate to the overall profit margin.
If a company happens to have an influx of hundreds of thousands of new customer inquiries, how would you envision they pay for that?  Should they just close their doors, or hope that the influx either passes (temporary) or turns into actual customers (permanent) so they can afford to hire more staff and not fire them the minute the heat is gone?
I had high hopes for bitcoin to generate interest in entrepreneurship, but with this "I'm going to get rich!!!" crowd coming in, the opposite is happening.
blockchain provides an exceptional service that I have paid...$0 for.  If I am going to email them or demand better stability, I'd want to pay for that.  In fact, here's an open call for blockchain to provide a VIP paid tier of service.  I'll pay.

I created The Bitcoin Oath specifically so bitcoin spenders can encourage businesses to publicly announce if they keep BTC or sell it off right away. 
I'm modifying the oath to allow for a business to show what percentage they keep and sell.
All my bitcoin-accepting businesses keep 100% of BTC as BTC.  We buy supplies with BTC and even pay some of our employees in BTC.  We're committed to bitcoin as an actual currency, not just a money transmission system.

I'm a bit nervous about it -- many vendors who accept bitcoin through processors are converting the BTC to fiat the next day automatically. This means that a lot of bitcoin will end up being sold, putting downward pressure on the price if there are a lot of sales.
My businesses adhere to the [Bitcoin Oath]( -- we don't sell bitcoin for fiat, ever.  If my businesses need fiat for the transaction, I personally exchange the bitcoin for fiat, off of the exchanges and away from market pressure.

Loans in a fiat central banking system are part of inflation (creation of new money) which causes price increases.
Without central banks inflating the money supply, prices should be more realistic -- and more affordable for savers.
In the 70s, when mortgages were 18%+, housing prices were actually affordable for savers who didn't want to borrow.  People bought cars with savings.
We can hope this will happen with bitcoin.

Ouch, that's a harsh lesson, but thanks for sharing your story so others can learn.
The morals of the story:
1. Don't mine when there are hundreds of posts as to the reason why mining is a losing proposition.
2. Don't invest in mining cooperatives for reason 
3. Don't waste time on markets you can't easily compete in.
But, you've learned from those lessons.  The dozens or hundreds of hours spent trying to cash in on the "bitcoin craze" can be used to create wealth by exchanging your skills for income.
There are many websites where you can work for bitcoin.  There's a subreddit dedicated to that.
Go and use your free hours to create an income.  Store some of that in fiat, some in bitcoin, and keep some set aside for some risky ventures (not gambling) if you can afford the risk.
The people who got rich on bitcoin were very early adopters.  They took a huge risk.  Many failed.

Technically they could be reversed with 51% of the miners deciding to, I would guess.  Hard fork.  But it would be hella ugly.
I don't understand why people are so up in arms about irreversibility.
For *thousands of years*, humans lived under the premise of "caveat emptor" or "buyer beware".  People knew THEY ALONE had the responsibility to make sure they were buying a good product from a good vendor.
Now that it's caveat venditor ("seller beware"), people feel safe, but EVERYONE is paying 10-30% more for EVERYTHING because a few people don't want to be responsible themselves.
Caveat emptor = the right way markets should work.  If someone screws you, tell your friends, and build a feedback system of trust.

In the simplest possible explanation, the money multiplier effect means that banks take in deposits in cash or check (100% deposits), and the regulations require that they only keep a percentage of those deposits on hand for redemption.  Call it 10%.
With the other 90%, the banks can loan that money out for loans, credit card purchases, etc.  That money circulates into other banks as cash deposits.  The 2nd bank now has that 90% on deposit, and needs to keep 10% of it on-hand (reserve requirement).  They loan out 90% of it as loans, credit cards, etc.
The 3rd bank now gets the 81% of the original.  They have to reserve 10%.
So banks have "deposits" that can be redeemed, but they also have cash from the loans which are deposits which can be redeemed.  In the 10% example, there's 100%+90%+81%+72% etc etc etc -- newly created "money".
As long as everyone doesn't try to withdraw their deposits at the same time ("bank run"), the system works.  If people try to withdraw their deposits at the same time, the Federal Reserve steps in and creates new capital for the banks to use as reserves.
This is fractional reserve banking, and it's one reason why having loans and credit cards is partially to blame for the inflation (but the Federal Reserve causes more harm, lately).
I don't have debt and I don't take it on.  When I have fiat, I keep it in cash -- preventing the banks from lending against it.
If all of us would hoard cash as notes, the banking system would collapse.

No need to be depressed.  Remember: when you feel like shit, it means that millions of others are in your shoes.  Find a way to capitalize on that.  That's the natural way.
I write about what you're talking about -- I call it "high reward living".  Every day, someone asks me why I'm "so lucky" to get to travel and relax.  I tell them: my friends ask me to go drinking, and I say no.  It's not that I can't afford it, it's that they can't afford to travel and relax BECAUSE of their high reward behaviors.
Everything is high reward today: video games, professional sports, even going to a music concert.  And, our brains get addicted to the "thrill" of these rewards.
So relax a bit.  Work hard.  Put off instant gratifications and exchange them for gratifications that come from successfully working hard at something.
Don't sweat it.  I blew 7 figures in my 20s uselessly.  Try looking back at that and not feeling a bit depressed.  It wasn't that I didn't earn it, I BLEW it.  Gone.  Poof.
You'll find out that life offers many opportunities, but most people can't take advantage of them, because they blew too much time and money on useless thrill seeking.

You don't need any option to withdraw fiat if you're doing arbitrage properly.
Keep $20k in fiat in each exchange.  Do your buy/sells based on the AGGREGATE of your fiat and your AGGREGATE of your BTC.
Doesn't matter what you're buying and what you're selling if you have enough to cover volatility.
I know a few people doing it on a small scale and making profits.  They only actually TAKE profits when a fiat liquid exchange has the highest price (i.e. when BitStamp is higher than Gox, which has been happening lately)

I'm a capitalist in every way, but my own mentor in life (also a capitalist, of the Austrian school mindset) engaged me to be charitable in areas that provided for me.  I don't donate to not-for-profits, I "donate" to entrepreneurs who helped me along the way.
That being said, I never sell my bitcoins for USD.  I started a website --  -- that is my oath to keeping Bitcoin spending to other businesses that enact the same type of investment in the Bitcoin markets.
I do agree that competitive mining will always be the strongest reason to mine, and I also believe that markets solve problems, all problems.  When mining rewards plummet, if transaction fees don't compensate, miners will stop mining, but that should cause difficulty to drop, allowing remaining miners to recoup their costs and net a profit.  It will work itself out, certainly.
Still, I would love *the option* for charitable contributions.
I thought about just engaging a few small miners who purchased non-profitable mining rigs, and just giving them some BTC for their electricity bill based on their proof of mining.
Likely what I will do -- maybe "donate"/"invest" 5% of my BTC profits each month to a small miner of my choice.

Right now, I try to spend bitcoin income on bitcoin-accepting suppliers (I have 2 at the moment, but I am working on 5 more).  I also pay one of my part time staff in BTC (100%).
What is left, I sell to myself personally at the market rate of acceptance.  This floods the business with fiat capital, and I sit and hold the BTC.
If the business ever NEEDS the BTC, I sell it back at the previous sell price that I bought it for.
Since I'm buying and selling at the same price, I am hoping to avoid capital gains taxes -- although I'm sure the now-outdated tax authorities won't see it that way.

Best bet is to do your own pre-sale with an integrated affiliate back end.
Let people pre-buy, but also allow them to use social media to share an affiliate link.  If they get 3 friends to buy, their shirt is free.
This way, you can post 4 new designs, let people vote with their dollars, and let people get the word out.
For new garment lines, I recommend a Us$500 heat press and a run on plastisol transfers.  Then you order blank garments as needed, and can transfer the plastisol to whatever color or size or style ordered.
No need to print 100 shirts at a time when you can print 100 transfers and be ready for orders on demand.

[Here's one tracking number]( that just went off the radar.  This happens over and over and over.  4 weeks, 8 weeks, doesn't matter.
Since our margins are so slim ($5 t-shirt deals daily, you can't ask for huge margins), it's very expensive to lose $60 in cost on a $70 order.  We are currently reconsidering how to handle int'l, and may just abolish it since it's too costly to manage at our price range, unfortunately.

It doesn't matter.
"Price" is merely 4 actions connecting at a central point: the supply of goods, the supply of currency, the desire of good holders for currency, and the desire of currency holders for goods.
Right now, there are a lot of people who are sitting on bitcoin balances and NOT spending them on goods or exchanging for fiat.  The only bitcoin that matters RIGHT NOW is who has bitcoin to trade for something else, and who has something else to trade for bitcoin.
If the supply and demands numbers change, the "price" of bitcoin will change in real time, barring regulations preventing its use (doubtful).
Lost wallets are equal to people sitting on bitcoin and not wanting to use it at all.  The price will reflect supply and demand.

If you're a merchant, you really WANT to use a third party for transactions before saving to cold storage.  It's far too much work to try to connect a payment with an invoice number otherwise.

True, but a customer who returns to the site to review is much more likely to become a return customer.
We've done thousands of orders this year and our screw up rate is under 0.5%.  That's pretty stunning if you consider the workflow on 100% custom goods in 6-8 business days.
But the screwed up jobs are a mess.  Sometimes tracking numbers show delivery.  Other times we reprint and before we ship we see the complainers wearing the original order items on Facebook.
Usually it's our fault.  No excuses other than bad management.  And I praise social networks and reddit for keeping us honest.  If anything, we get MORE orders when we publicly fix a bad error.  So I'm in support of ALL feedback methods -- I know we can do better in resolving angry customers than most competitors can (and my profit margin allows for up to 2% screw ups).

You're observing person-to-person trades where?  Do you also not observe person-to-person cash transactions as frequent as credit card buys?
Sayin bitcoin is too expensive is like saying $100 bill is too expensive for someone who wants to "get into USD".  There are many options, and some of the options aren't seen by you.
Last week, I transacted 6 BTC transactions, IN PERSON.  I went for coffee with a friend and I kicked her $5 in BTC to the wallet I helped her create.  I went for dinner with people and I paid the tab-payer in BTC to their new wallet.  
Most people can't afford the level of investment in anything, because they're too addicted to beer and pizza and polyester purses and video games and watching professional sports and zombie TV shows all their lives.  They have no patience and they have no desire to save for the future.

The dilemma is integrating with the merchant payment network requires a bank license.
I have spent months reading banking regulations, and there's no outlet to get a variance for the idea.  I would do it in a heartbeat.
Most people are clueless as to how expensive it is to run a bank.  Since banks have the license to print new money, and since banks can earn interest on that legal counterfeiting, the costs of banking are hidden to users.
Get rid of fractional reserve, and all of a sudden a guy who pays $0 a month will be stunned when his full reserve bank demands $50 a month plus 0.2% of balance monthly.
Worst part is, a full reserve bank wouldn't even need FDIC coverage -- but they'd still have to pay for it.

That's debatable -- when gold was redeemable for currency, transfer and transport was handled by the banks, naturally.  After 1913, when gold was only redeemable to governments, gold lost its function of money.  In 74, when Nixon closed the gold window, gold was barely a money.  A store of value, sure, but a money?  I don't think it's possible.
Money has to be all of those things to be free of burden and fair for all.  Just because people say something is money doesn't mean they understand money, of course.

I'll both agree and disagree with you on the definition of currency.
The general term of currency may be "medium of exchange", but the specific "modern" use signifies banknotes or government money.  Without debating the factual merits of Wikipedia, the [page]( there on currency even lends support to my opinion that MOST people equate "currency" with "officially sanctioned government money".
The value to me, and to many who want to rely on the agorist perspective of Bitcoin, is to promote that individual wealth isn't in government-sanctioned money, but in how potent our own individual value is in the goods and services we offer, versus the goods and services of others.  As such, a bartering medium perspective to Bitcoin has advantages in working legally but outside the pro-regulatory crowd of Bitcoin.

Wrong.  A business model is about meeting the needs of the customers that are most profitable, not about meeting the needs of all people who want to be customers.
|  Or at the very least stop accepting new customers and orders until they can handle the volume of people attempting to use the service. 
No need to.  Customers who are unhappy will leave naturally, and if you close the door, you might lose out on profitable customers who don't bitch and moan.  I.E., non-cheapskates.
|  it's completely unacceptable to take several days and sometimes even a week plus to respond to customers' problems. 
I'm fine with it.  It's a high risk market right now, and I accept the shortcomings because I know I am profiting by being an early adopter.
| non kool-aid drinking users.
If you don't agree there is a huge chance of a huge reward, go away and come back when things have matured.
| People are quick to criticize non bitcoin services for much smaller of reasons but refuse to hold bitcoin to a similar standard.
Actually, SOME people are critical of non-bitcoin services.  You know what I do lately with new customers?  I check if they Yelp.  If they do, and I don't like their attitude, I don't let them buy from me.  Customers and suppliers can swap places: I am buying money and I am paying for it with my service.  If I don't like the service attached to your money, I won't buy it.
| Reading solely this subreddit for too long will almost convince any sane person that it is in fact a giant ponzi scheme 
I am on plenty of bitcoin forums, including a few private ones involving somewhat powerful and guaranteed wealthy people.  I am involved in bitcoin as an early adopter, aware of the risks and aware of the points of failure, including market growth outstripping any business' ability to maintain perfect customer service.
My biggest problem with bitcoin is some of the  current users.  The subset I'm talking about are cheaper and yet more demanding of attention than any I've ever met in over 20 years of being in business.  My 2nd business ever was "online" in 1986 or so -- a BBS.  In over 20 years, I have yet to meet people as critical and as cheap as I've met in bitcoin.
I can't wait until the dorks are gone, the currency stabilizes, and the average Joe can use it.  It'll be good riddance to bad seeds who have no concept of markets and economies.
If you think a customer demands great service, that's fine.  Coinbase is a customer of yours, too, you know.  They're buying your money and paying for it with their service.  Maybe they don't like your money, because it's too much of a hassle to accept.  So they'd rather you disappear because there are plenty of money vendors they can buy from.

Still very easy to do.  WordPress + post_user_meta + get_user_meta.
Then, optionally run an hourly cron job to read the database, look up each address on the blockchain API and validate if it was paid (and the amount).  Then write to the database that the payment was valid.
Then have a daily or weekly cron job pick a winner out of validated donations.
Very automated for you.

I'm currently invested in mining groups for "benevolence" reasons.  The "profit" I get out of mining is inferior to just letting my bitcoin sit around and do nothing.  But I'm a business owner who is coming to rely on bitcoin, so a secure and safe mining network is important to my future.
In Q1 of 2014, I am going to start a [Business Owners Mining Pool]( -- just like a business will pay money to provide free WiFi or free coffee to customers, businesses that rely on a secure and fast network will also eventually be miners.  Not for reward profit, but to support the network they rely on.
Don't assume that mining has to be directly profitable.  Mining is like a street or an Internet connection -- people rely on those, but they're not even tools, per se, they're foundational supports for their actual income activities.

Because you have people who have no understanding of fractional reserve banking, that's why.
FRB allows banks to compete in ways that real businesses can't.  No one else in the entire economy is allowed to **counterfeit money legally** and then charge interest on top of it and then compete.
That's how banks exist.  They have a license to counterfeit and charge interest on it.  The profits they get from this immorality allows them to build huge, beautiful branches, hire millions of customer service agents, and pay their CEOs hundreds of millions each.
Until people understand the theft that goes on, every minute of every day, every time they deposit $0.01 into an account, people will never understand why other businesses can not provide that level of service and security.
How about I steal from your BTC balance, use it to pay for a customer service agent JUST FOR YOU, and then we call it a day?  Is that acceptable? If it is, I will open an exchange just for you right now.  I'll even give you 5% under the market rate, as long as I can steal 8% of your balance annually to pay for someone to answer your emails.

If you want to calculate how likely volatility is to decrease, you'll need to do the following:
1. Look up all wallet balances and the fiat value at the time of last movement.
2. Average these out.
As the average cones closer to the current price, volatility should reduce.
There are millions of BTC that were bought or mined at $5 or $10.  Those owners are likely waiting for their right time to liquidate.
As older unmoved coins become more recently moved coins, volatility based on BIG profit-taking moves should reduce.

I'm off to India in 2 days specifically to visit some of my garment suppliers **and** to discuss paying for cotton garments using BTC.
We currently pay for our ink in BTC direct from China.  I also pay for some lubricating oils in BTC, but neither is a big part of the process.  If I can source garments (30% of product cost) in BTC, it would be HUGE.
I'll admit that all of my garment suppliers now are complete hellholes to work in.  In 2014 I am going to Honduras to discuss the option to get blanks direct, and I hear the working conditions are superior.

Every time 1 guy sells a HUGE sum, usually MANY guys are buying that sum in pieces.
As this continues, the market should become LESS volatile from SINGLE individual sells or buys.
Of course, at this point, someone with a LOT of cash could feasibly buy out open orders, but this should technically cause the price to skyrocket quickly if sells are liquidated.

You're looking at only mintages?
How about commercial paper gold-back notes that allowed the commercial banks to manage private holdings of currency?
[Here is one article]( PDF WARNING
There were a lot of [warnings at the time]( (PDF WARNING) regarding gold redemption, both from a private holding perspective and a commercial bank holding perspective.
Gold coin mintage was not the only form of gold useful for trade -- in fact, gold coins minted weren't even specifically for trade as I mentioned further back in this thread.  For the common man, sure -- but for actual wholesale level trade, it wasn't merely the minted coin at stake, but the holdings of heavier bullion that backed the notes at the time.
Commercial bank deposits 5,000 ounces of gold at Federal Reserve "for security and liquidity" and receives X amount of notes.  Average Joe has notes he can redeem for coinage, but he has no access to 100% of the gold reserve.
The Federal Reserve lied.  It's pretty easy to see, if you go back to the newspapers of the day -- it just takes time.

A good currency should never be "stable" because it should reflect society's combined demand for goods and services.
If goods and services are too expensive, people will hoard or invest in businesses who are trying to make things less expensive.  If goods and services are too cheap, people will spend to acquire them until the supply of those goods and services get low enough to allow the price to go up.
A fluctuating currency value is a good thing -- it entire entices savings/investment or it flushes out hoarders.

No one knows where anything will go.  You're looking for validation to cover your fears.  That's human.  Markets aren't human.  They're irrational at best.  If you can't afford to lose the $1500, don't do it.  Don't even think about doing it.  If it's SOLELY greed that you're feeling, step back.

I haven't researched blockchain.info's system very much.  I use them for one of my hot wallets, but I don't keep much in there so it never mattered to me.
From what I recall, blockchain.info NEVER has access to your wallet.  Ever.  When you send bitcoins to another address, you merely are creating an instruction, signed with your private key, that is forwarded by blockchain.info into the actual blockchain itself.
They can not send bitcoins on your behalf because they have no access to your private keys.
If you log in from a friend's computer, you're decrypting your wallet (encrypted on blockchain.info's server) into your friend's browser via javascript + 2FA + your password.  So the wallet is only resident in your friend's javascript memory.

Bitcoin purchase insurance would work hand-in-hand with a feedback system.  People would be able to purchase insurance at a price based on the seller's feedback points, with the subsidy of the insurance paid for by sellers who want to be feedback rated.

So what you're saying is that BitPay should allow websites to give their customers an option to pay in USD to BitPay, and have BitPay give the merchant BTC?
Do you think it's wise that BitPay sits on the credit card charge for 45-90 days before releasing the bitcoin?  Or should BitPay pay the merchant in bitcoin immediately, and then somehow cover the chargebacks from fraudulent credit card charges?
TL/DR: This has been discussed endlessly, and BitPay can not afford the liabilities.

The dilemma we face, at the moment, is that the vast majority of consumers **do not want to be responsible for their money safety**.  Markets used to operate on a "caveat emptor" (buyer beware) mode of operation, but now it's "caveat venditor" (seller beware).  Banks engage consumer protections and consumers pay for these protections through the legal theft banks are allowed to create.
Consumers are used to (1) their money being safe and (2) their money being stolen through inflation.  Trying to convince the average consumer that they need to be responsible with their money and in picking who they purchase from will take a massive change.
A consistent rise in Bitcoin's value over a decade will help, certainly.  Consumers who see their friends and family members "making money by saving it" will start to question inflation AND the banks security.  Good security at high cost is a bad deal for the consumer.
Once regulatory concerns are figured out, I do believe that bitcoin "banks" will come into being -- entities that control AND insure your balances, but at a high cost (probably a fixed percentage a year to pay for insurance and safety measures).  Some consumers will go this route -- especially if the fixed cost is lower than the rising value of bitcoin.  If bitcoin slowly rises 30% in value a year and insurance/safety costs 10%, they won't worry about using such a "bank".

I get an onslaught of emails, PMs and Facebook questions daily about all this stuff.  Today I had almost 20 questions about mining.  So I decided to invest in a mining cloud to show people how I am going to be throwing my money away.  It's just $1500, so it's no big deal, but it's a great way to show others what's going on.  On my blog, I will be publishing updates a few times a week to show people the declining value of mining.  Sure, the first day I might get a 1% return, but it'll start falling FAST.
I am also going to do some arbitrage to show people how difficult and time consuming it is.  I'll put probably $10k of my money up on various exchanges, and publish the results a few times a week.
I'm also going to do an auto-buy recurring on Coinbase for a measly $50 or $100 a week.  Again, I will post the results and update them a few times a week on my blog so people can see.  And so I can link people to the pages when they ask the same question, over and over and over.

Sometimes people need to be reminded.
What is price?  Price is merely where both sides' supply and demand curves cross.  There are 4 lines involved.
The seller's supply of bitcoin and his demand for cash, at a certain price.
The buyer's supply of cash and his demand for bitcoin, at a certain price.
Where these figures cross is what we call "price".
Since different exchanges have different buyers and sellers and varying points of supplies and demands, they will have different prices.
The spread changes based on thousands, millions or billions of individual decisions, every millisecond.

One thing that these authors ignore is something I repeat often:
1. A truly rare good that is divisible, fungible and easily transferred or transported can be used as a bartering medium
2. If said good is rarer than other media used for bartering ("currencies"), its value can go up against those other media, especially if those media are being increased in quantity ("inflation").
To put it simply, government currencies are being exponentially run-down in value, to the [tune of hundreds of billions]( a year en masse.
As such, exponential devaluations can create greater value in rare, fungible, divisible, easy to transfer/transport bartering media.
Gold's biggest dilemma has always been how to transfer/transport it.

I created [The Bitcoin Oath]( to help people understand the difference between companies/individuals who take bitcoin as payment and immediately sell it off for fiat, and those who take bitcoin as payment and try to invest in the bitcoin economy.
My businesses accept bitcoin as payment, but we NEVER sell it for fiat.  We attempt to use our bitcoin proceeds to acquire more supplies (I am doing business with China in bitcoin already, and going to India in a few weeks to scout possible bitcoin accepting wholesalers).  I have 1 part time employee I pay in bitcoin.
If a business accepts bitcoin but immediately sells it for fiat, what good are they?  They're just pushing the price DOWN.
Buy a gift card with bitcoin and you're pushing the price down.  Don't do that unless MAYBE your bitcoin was acquired when it was worth $5.  At least then the bitcoin is being sold to someone who values it much higher.

I updated the Google Doc Spreadsheet with some more information, estimates and data.  If I sold out today, right now, I'd actually be 0.087 BTC ahead -- but that's more about the value of the share than the actual return on mining.
If for some reason the mining shares don't tank when the 1 TH/s mining rigs come out *en masse*, I might break even.  Doubtful, but it's possible.

I was likely the first retail business in Chicago to accept bitcoin -- we do around 7-10% of sales in BTC.
On my consulting side in a very niche industry, I was the first to accept bitcoin internationally.  I'm doing about 20% there! but next year I'm doubling my fiat rate so I expect bitcoin to be 90%+.  International payments in fiat are a pain.  Someone mailed me an international check and it took 3 weeks before I could touch the funds.  Insane.
I expect bitcoin sales to go up to at least 15% on my ecommerce sites in 2014 (we will offer a 10% discount for using any cryptocoin), but I wouldn't be surprised if it hits 20%.

First thing: call your bank or visit a branch (latter is better).  Request a courtesy removal of the overdrafts.  I had a similar situation happen with a supplier who ran 3 $1800 charges against my account, causing over $300 in overdrafts when I caught the problem.  My bank was happy to cover $250 of it, and the supplier reimbursed me for the other $50 (plus a little extra in free product).
Second: Stay on top of Coinbase -- I have yet to contact them, but I assume you can "bump" the request by filing a new one and linking to the old request number (if there is one?)

Sure, there are more transactions taking place with the price run up.
Remember, you not attaching a fee means miners will include it if they want to.  If there are people paying fees, or higher fees than you offered, they're going to attract priority confirms.
Paying a fee is optional, but mining your transaction is optional as well.  That's the beautiful thing about freedom of association: if no one wants to deal with you, they don't have to.

1 BTC won't be a lot until 100 millis can buy groceries for a family of 4 for a month.  Let's called 100 millis = $1200 to cover that.  So 1 BTC = $12,000.  That's a lot.
What will we call it?  Nothing.  Until the price finds more stability, which is likely a long time away, there is a strongly likelihood that we will skip millis entirely because of acceleration in adoption.

I've bought in and never once have I see a shitty transaction system.
I've been getting bitcoin for over a year now -- selling good, doing services for people, etc.
I don't know what all the complainers are complaining about.  Tens of thousands of us acquired bitcoin without mining.
I would venture a guess and say that you probably have a lot of things in life that you've been frustrated about -- and you have credible things to blame it all on, right?
Bitcoin is technology.  Technology requires studying to understand and comprehend it.  It doesn't happen overnight, it doesn't come easily.  If it was easy, everyone would have bought in 3 years ago.  I surely didn't, and neither did hundreds of new people who come to this subreddit daily -- angry at themselves for not buying when it was $10.
Look, not even a month ago, BTC was $100.  And people were asking if it was in a bubble and if it was going to crash soon.  And people came here frustrated that they didn't buy when it was $50.
I would bet you 5BTC that 99% of people who didn't buy at $100 also didn't buy at $300 and won't buy at $700.
It's a pity you're frustrated, why not jump on Coinbase NOW and buy some bitcoin?  You can buy $10 worth, RIGHT NOW.

Because bitcoin is rare, one individual holding all the bitcoin and not spendng them will create a lower supply of bitcoins, which should increase their value.
At some point, they will be valuable enough for the holder to want to spend them for goods or services.  Once they're spent, they should make their way into the wallets of people who don't have a lot.
If for some reason they never spend their hoard, that's fine -- the value of all the other bitcoins will be higher because of the hoarding.

No, it wouldn't optimize it because of the delay in transferring funds to rebalance your accounts.
My 3% means the 3% of my total arbitrage bankroll, not 3% of my investment assets.  I ran a long term study on arbitrage, and repeatedly I would "run out of funds" if I used more than 3% per exchange per trade situation.
Pick 3 exchanges, divide your bitcoin bankroll into 3rds (33% each).  That gives you 11 total trades per exchange you can manage while funds are being bounced around (3-6 weeks, let's say).

An off-chain market will occur naturally through competitive forces.
For example, if I want to send tips to people under the minimum, I would have zero issue sending some third part US$5 of my bitcoin to store for off-chain tipping, and let them require artists to hit a US$5 minimum for withdrawals to an actual wallet.
Edit: I do agree that this value should be lowered, though.  Transaction fee minimums are actually starting to look like real money.

Except I'm not a hippie, I'm a pure capitalist.  I'm as capitalist as it comes.
As a pure capitalist, I repudiate protectionism like copyright or intellectual property.  I encourage competition.  I encourage trading my goods or services for value: each side of a transaction is both a provider and a customer.
Bitcoin is a pure bartering medium.  There are others like me who want to encourage the benefits of pure capitalism, and Bitcoin allows us to do so.
Hippies are not capitalists.  Capitalism is competitive, and promoting the bartering aspect of Bitcoin over the regulated official currency attempts brings some competitive value to a service/goods seller.
Speculating, to me, is a fine idea, but it isn't one that will help convince the millions of small entrepreneurs that there's value in the medium.  Government regulation might entice some larger corporations to accept it, but it ignores the huge number of service and goods providers internationally who understand that government regulations destroy competition by smaller businesses.

Infrastructure gets built by having money invested to build it.
Bitcoin' slow transaction fee demands keep profits minimal per transaction.
When huge rushes come, the infrastructure built is based on the average business expectations with some wiggle room for small rushes.
Over time, as companies find ways to present a strengthened product with a reasonable profit for themselves, expansion will happen.
But who is going to invest millions in infrastructure in a market that doesn't transact billions for that investor (at a sub-1% margin!).
It's young, it's early, and the average person transacting is fee adverse.

US bank regulations won't allow it.
I tried doing this with gold years ago -- would be easy to swap balances for fiat depending on people depositing or spending -- but the Feds said no.  I even hired a consultant who tried everything.
**edit**: I even had some preliminary code in place to do random trials with.  In aggregate, the "bank" handles the exchange instantly on paper, and uses a liquid pool of cash and commodity for shortages while acquiring more cash/commodity on an exchange to replenish the pools.
It is quite simple, and fair, and compatible with the banking network, but the government hates change.

Most economists belong to the Keynesian School of economic thinking, i.e. -- government needs to manage the markets.
I'm pro-bitcoin, but I see MANY areas where bitcoin could fail.  I'm hopeful that it won't, and I am hopeful that it will overcome many of its flaws, but only time will tell.
I am invested fully in bitcoin -- not just in owning a balance of bitcoins, but also in making it market worthy.

I should also ask, for anyone who sees this: what is a good mining rig for a business who wants to support a healthy network but doesn't particular care about income.
I'm guessing the income part DOES matter since it is defined by efficiency.
I pay $250 a month for a massive Internet connection at my main retail space.  It's a sunk cost, but it provides us with faster communications and it provides our visiting customers with excellent WiFi.
I pay $250 a month for a good water delivery service, and for free (pod) coffee that isn't too bad.  Its a sunk cost.
I am willing to pay about $100 a month in extra electricity costs -- I don't particular care about the mining rig price, if it's under $500 I'll jump on it.  Call it 0.75 BTC.  I guess I need to shop around now.

"Professional" Forex and stock traders, more often than not, understand markets far better than the average Joe who is trying to time the market.
I've had a few dozen PM conversations with people on here who are trying to get rich with bitcoin by timing the market, and they're getting crushed.  They are trying to use their living funds to temporarily get in and out of bitcoin, and the minute they actually need those funds for rent or food or bills, the market seems to correct downwards, and they get crushed.
If all you have to play with is $1000, or even $5000, the upside in 30 day is likely NOT going to be 200% profits.  Is it possible?  Sure, if you cherry pick your data.  Has the trend been upward over 2 years?  Of course it has.
But in a heated market with a huge influx of new buyers at vastly different prices, there is no way for the average Joe to comprehend the intricacies of investment-sided supply and demand.  There's just too much.
If they're looking to gain value, they should take money they are not reliant on in the short run and play with that.  Accept the possibilities of:
1. Huge delays in withdrawals
2. Exchanges going down due to high volume traffic
3. Bigger players causing markable short term dips and gains
4. Illiquidity on their exchange
5. Bugs and errors
I hate seeing good people lose money.  I've done well with bitcoin, but I also did well with housing (sold everything in early 2007) and did fine with the tech boom as well (got out shy of peak, but happy).
Bitcoin **is** different in many ways, because unlike a share of Apple stock, I can actually use it for something of value.  I can't take my Apple stock to a vendor and buy something with it.  Because of that relatively unique aspect to bitcoin (a currency, an investment opportunity, a reasonable long term risk), it's a great place for everyone to be involved in some way.
Forex trader with a large bankroll: go play daily
Average Joe with less than 5 figures bankroll: only gamble short term what you can truly lose, bank your profits when you can, and try to only keep in the amount you can lose
Anti-fiat advocate: buy and hold, and when you want to buy a product, try to use bitcoin and quickly replace bitcoin with fiat on Coinbase or another bitcoin vendor.

It's a fine question.
The basic views of my tenets come from a little combination of Rothbard and Pareto.
According to my (admittedly amateur) research on various societies, the Pareto Principle seems to be a realistic way to label society: 80% serfs, 20% lords.
It doesn't matter WHAT the political system happens to be, that's where we are.  Democracy, republicanism, socialism, Marxism: they all seem to "stabilize" quickly into the 80/20 breakdown.
That's the feudalism part.
The anarchism part is also conjecture, but it jives with what I see in the world and in world history: laws are only created for the weak serfs, and for outcasts from the lord/ruling class.  If you're embraced by the lords, the laws don't matter.  That's the anarcho- part.

I thought about it but I really like selling the $7 t-shirts.
My original plan was to just give everyone a rebate of $0.25 BTC per shirt they bought, but the profit margin of the site means I would have some shirts I would lose money it.
It's a thin margin site for a reason -- it pays for the labor of the guy running the printer, just barely.
I may consider doing a "bitcoin rebate" on other ecommerce sites I have, where every order automatically has $0.25 BTC priced into every item, and everyone would have the option to receive their refund if they supplied a receiving address.

There is no need to move the decimal point or switch to mBTC at the moment, because the volatility and upward appearance of the long term price dissuade us from switching until there has been a long term stability in the price.
The use of [SI decimals]( makes much more sense to me.
If you have 0.00189436 BTC, you can write it as
0.001'894'36 which is EASILY read and understood as
1 milli, 894 micros, 36 Satoshi.
There's no need to switch to anything but what we already use, it displays beautifully, it won't word-wrap, and you can pronounce it and calculate with it simply.

I tell people this every day.  Most people would have liquidated somewhere before $1000.
I've never liquidated BTC (except once to play on an exchange to review it, and I've loaned BTC for friends to short it and THEY liquidated it, but then bought it back of course).  I read Satoshi's paper before I got involved, I browsed bitcointalk for weeks or maybe a few months.
I saw the value in it NOT as a speculative tool, but as a tool for freedom.  And that, to me, is worth more than paper profit.

It is not infinite in quantity, it is infinite in divisibility.
Fiat currency is infinite in quantity; if government prints more, the people holding the old dollars are harmed by government inflation.  The holders are not the recipients of NEW currency.
Divisibility means the holders of bitcoin "gain" as bitcoin is divided by the market.  If people need to go from 1.00 BTC to 1.0000 BTC, all that matters is the people holding bitcoin now have a more valuable currency.
In dollars, if the market needs more currency, holders have $1.00 and the government creates $2.00 more, which means the old holders have been devalued down to 33% of original value.

Banking regulations do not allow for it, at the moment, and likely ever.  Full reserve banking is anathema to the Federal Reserve -- they actually aggress against banks that hold too big of a reserve (10% only will get you punished!).  A BTC held bank would require a 100% reserve.

If everyone WITHDREW their fiat from banks, the debt problem would be solved through bankruptcy.
Debt REQUIRES deposits to exist ('money multiplier effect').  If people would just save under the mattress, we could restrain the banks completely.
Won't happen, of course, but it's fun to keep fiat in currency form and prevent SOME money multiplier effect from happening.
As more vendors start accepting bitcoin, and those vendors stop converting bitcoin to fiat, it'll slowly start happening.
The downside is that a LOT of vendors who accept bitcoin are immediately liquidating that BTC for fiat (through BitPay, etc).  I like seeing companies like Gyft exist, but they're not helping the economy of BTC.
Demand your vendors accept BTC and we won't need fiat converters.

They're not an exchange, they're a retailer.  They also need to be able to actually buy BTC at the price they're offering it at.  In a market where prices change more than 1% in seconds.
I don't run a retail shop without 50% margins.
If you think you can do better, do it.  Start a bitcoin exchange or retail market.  In the US.  Find out just how much lawyers, accountants and high security techs costs.

Do you know if you should wait for a sale on a video game or shirt you want to buy, or do you buy it when you need it or want it and can afford it?
I'm not trying to be a prick, but it's a really dumb question.  Think logically for a moment with me: why would someone want to give you an honest answer?  I'm being serious.
If I want to sell a bunch of bitcoins, I'm going to tell people to buy buy buy (causing the price to go up so I can sell mine higher).  If I want to buy a bunch of bitcoins, I'm going to tell people to sell sell sell (causing the price to go down so I can buy mine lower).
Your question is asked, and answered here, 20 times a day.  And it's not a good question.  If anything, it makes people asking it look like they really shouldn't be buying bitcoin at all.
My recommendation?  Buy a primer book on investing for beginners.  It'll explain why no one knows where a price will be in 5 minutes, 5 days, or 5 years.  That's why there's a reward: it's a risk!

You have no idea what flags your bank returned during the ACH.  ACH is not just your bank sending money to another bank, it's your bank sending money to a clearing house, along with certain flags that warn the receiving bank about possibly problems.
Each bank is different in how they fill out this extra meta information.  Coinbase has to monitor it, because if an account is hacked, then it is in their best interest to return the money fast rather than end up under the ACH banhammer.
I applaud them for being high security and dealing with risk.  We have zero idea how many people's bank accounts have been hacked for bitcoin.  Those people are innocent non-bitcoin-aware people, so they don't come here to complain.

I run websites where we get 2 sales out of 100 inquiry emails about our business.  It costs me about $500 to have 100 emails replied to -- so it costs us $250 to acquire customers at those sites.

The price of BTC has no effect on the fact that you will never earn back 100% of the BTC you spent on the miner.
If you have $25,000 (27.7 BTC as of today) and buy 27.7 BTC or buy 1 miner&gt;
**27.7 BTC bought**
After one month: 27.7 BTC
After two months: 27.7 BTC
After 12 months: 27.7 BTC
**1 miner bought**
After one month: 9 BTC
After two months: 6 BTC + 9 BTC = 15 BTC
After 3 months: 3 BTC + 6 BTC + 9 BTC = 18 BTC
After 4 months: 1 BTC + 3 BTC + 6 BTC + 9 BTC = 19 BTC
After 12 months: 0.02 BTC + 0.05 BTC + 0.09 BTC + 1.2 BTC ... = 21.3 BTC

The term "price" is only a past-tense definition.
The definition of "price" is only significant to two parties: Party A that offers good/service 1 to Party B that trades good/service 2 for it.  That is all "price" means, and it matters only in regards to the past.
Take many "prices" for the same transactions, say bitcoin&lt;-&gt;dollar or massage&lt;-&gt;euro, in the same timeframe (say, yesterday), and you have "market price".
But that means nothing at this very moment, or moments from now.
Price is meant to be flexible, a sign of the overall market's supply and demand of and for goods/services.

This kid has been broke since he was born.  He's never had a pot to piss in but was lucky to have bought a high end gaming PC with a meager "inheritance" of a few grand.  I remember him talking about how useless his mining was (at the time) and then he gave up.
Now he's sitting on $1MM, but is that enough to be wealthy?  I don't think so.  I know he'll sell SOME of it soon, but I don't think he cares much about it.  When you're poor, you don't know wealth, and that's a scary step to take.

December 2nd is accurate.  They need to verify that you are indeed the account holder.
Some minority of people get flagged as high risk and their purchase reversed.  There's no rule about it, but my guess is that they didn't enter all their information identical to what the bank had, so the ACH may process but Coinbase receives some red flags and turns the order around rather than lose ACH access.
Once you are fully verified, you can do up to 1 BTC instantly, per day.

Right now, if I liquidated after 3 days, I'd be up 10% in BTC.  But it will change to negative quickly after the next difficulty increase.

I agree with this, the USG is a threat to entrepreneurs and has been since the HMO Act of 1973.
Which is why I have been working very diligently the past 5 years to create alternate streams of income internationally.  Right now, I rely on the US for 60% of my income, but I am not reliant on income to survive.  If I see moves to crush my income sources, I can and will move in less than 90 days notice.
I've also put the IRS and 2 local state tax departments on notice, too.  It doesn't hurt to let the taxman know that you've got options, and they need to play nicely or you'll exercise those options.  2 really good friends of mine and long term clients (both worth close to 8 figures, net) moved to new states after threatening the local taxman with it.  The wealthiest are ready to leave the US if necessary as the global economy becomes more feasible for profit-seeking entrepreneurs.

Better "return" than just $25k in mining equipment.
**Why?** -- The ROI on buying BTC is 0% BTC per month.  The ROI on mining equipment is **negative** once your hash rate falls to a tiny micropercentage of the overall hash rate.  You'll never ROI to 0% gain/loss in BTC.

Great point.
Even removing empty addresses, you still don't need to be holding a HUGE balance to be in the top 5% of wallet sizes.
Again, I'll assume that wealthy and ACTIVE bitcoin holders don't store everything in 1 address, but I don't think the VAST majority of ACTIVE holders have a huge balance.
Most of my friends who have bitcoin balances have far less than 0.5BTC -- and even at today's value (call it $400, whatever), it's a good place to be.
$20 a week, every week, recurring buy on Coinbase, and you're at least in the running should things get hot some day.  $20 a week is within reach of MOST people on here, I would guess.

I'm in the process of loaning about 20 BTC to some close and trustworthy friends who want to short the price over a period of time.
Since I know them personally, and they feel confident about a massive slide, I'm willing to accept a minimal 2% rate per month outstanding.
I also did some short term bitcoin loans to people who were shy a certain amount, and those were all paid back on time.
Only one guy really got crunched, and it wasn't a huge amount (0.1 BTC) so I figure he was out $30 more than if the value wasn't volatile.

That's an insane way to look at theft.
1. Mike deposits $500 into bank A.  Mike gets receipt saying he can withdraw that $500 on demand.
2. Bank A is required by Fed to retain 10% as a reserve.  Bank immediately loans out $450 to Peter to buy something.  Bank has Mike's $50 on reserve.
3. Peter deposits $450 into bank B.  Bank B holds 10% as a reserve ($45) and immediately loans out $405 to Steve to buy something.
4. Steve deposits $405 into bank C.  Bank C holds 10% as a reserve ($40.5) and immediately loans out $364.50 to Tom to buy something.
At any time during this process, Mike, Peter, Steve and Tom are allowed to withdraw their deposits, which total $1720.40.  But there was only $500 to begin with.  If they actually decided to withdraw all their money at the same time, there would actually be $2940.80 in the economy -- $1720.40 in deposits and $1220.40 in loans outstanding.  $2440.80 was created out of thin air.
On those $1220.40 in loans, the banks are charging interest to be paid.  Let's call it 10%.  In a year, the banks will make $122.04 in interest on money they created artificially, that never existed.
And on and on and on it goes.

If it only affected a tiny percentage of users transferring today, they have zero reason to announce anything.  A wide announcement might cause a flood of transfers, exacerbating their support queue and dev repair pressure.
Also, Coinbase keeps a large percentage of bitcoin in cold storage, offline.  This is to protect your balance.
If a higher number of transfers was transacted in a short window of time, they need to manually transfer from cold storage to online hot storage.
As I always say, many bitcoin users are demanding opposite things: they want instant access to their balance but they demand the security of offline storage.

Can the value of gold increase indefinitely?
Can the value of cotton increase indefinitely?
The price of any good or service is based strictly on supply and demand.  If the demand for a good or service (such as bitcoin) is high, and the supply is low, then the price goes up.
Consider this: there is a limited supply of BTC (21 million).  Right now, there is HIGH demand for it, so the price is "high" versus 2 years ago, when the demand was low.
If demand goes higher, the price will go higher.  If the demand drops, the price will go lower.

Start referencing your bitcoin amounts in RFB's [SI decimals](

0.00193682 would be written as

If you have 12 oranges, you might want to sell them for $20.
I want 12 oranges, but I am only willing to pay $12 for them.
You list your oranges on an orange exchange at 12 for $20.
I list my purchase desire on the same exchange at 12 for $12.
Another orange dealer might pop in and sell his 12 for $15.  Someone might pop on and want to buy oranges and offer $14.
Markets constantly are changing the last price because people have different prices they're willing to buy and sell at.  What if you all of a sudden decide you're desperate to buy a new TV before the big game?  You might lower the price of your 12 oranges from $20 to $12.  If so, we will make a trade and the price will be set, for that given second.

People are also used to modern banks, even though the banks pilfer from the customer base minute by minute.
Bitcoin is great because it finally puts responsibility in the hands of the individual.  The major issue here is that most people can't handle that responsibility, which is why we have the banking system and legal system and political system we do: people demanding leaders to guide them.
I'm a bull on bitcoin, but I also believe that there are parts of society that are getting smarter (about 20% of society).  I think the rest of society is getting dumber, and I'd rather not see them engage in Bitcoin because of it.  Caveat emptor.

Trading software can interact with an off-Internet hot wallet server.  The software sends a transfer order to the server.  The server sends (through a proxy) a verification request which verifies the transfer order through a third server, which allows the offline wallet server to dispense just enough for each transaction.
The wallet server and the verification server are not accessible from the Internet. 
If the exchange server is compromised, the hackers need to know the seed used to contact the wallet server AND the seed used to communicate with the verification server.

**Edit** Erase what I said.  Don't invest in bitcoin.  Anyone who asks "should I wait for a crash?" doesn't know the first thing about investing.  I'd recommend buying a good beginner's book on investing from Amazon or BN and read, read, read, read, read.

Break it down into supply and demand and you'll understand.
1. If people desire more bitcoin than sellers are willing to part with, the price of bitcoin goes up.
2. If sellers want to liquidate bitcoin more than buyers want it, the price of bitcoin goes down.
3. If people exist the stock market en masse, the value of the stock market goes down ("crash").
4. If people are sitting on fiat cash after liquidating stock positions, they may want to invest it in something that has shown a consistent return.
5. If the return of bitcoin leading up to a stock market liquidation continues to be strong, that cash may end up in bitcoin.
6. If the sellers of bitcoin at that time don't want to sell, the asking price for bitcoin should rise as new money is available to buy it.
Supply and demand creates prices in real-time.

I agree with the points you made about what I said.
1. Banks can provide great service because they can pay for it by legally stealing.  Coinbase can not legally steal, and has to actually pay attention to their costs or they'll go out of business. Better to lose some customers, make the rest REALLY happy, than to go out of business trying to please everyone.
2. Yes.

That's fine, as long as the people who are holding bitcoin aren't competing against new bitcoin released into the market.
I recommend you read more economics tomes from the Austrian School of economics -- it explains perfectly well that infinite divisibility is not the same as infinite inflatability.
Infinite decimals of bitcoin still keeps the same number of bitcoin in the economy.  If anything, infinite divisibility makes bitcoin even MORE desirable to hold against fiat currencies.

What happens is hackers attach keystroke logging apps to other software you may have downloaded.  I've seen torrents include them.  When you install the real app, the keystroke logger gets installed, too.
Then, the keystroke logger does TWO things:  it looks for known key combinations, say someone typing B-L-O-C-K-C-H-A-I-N-.-I-N-F-O.  Or a bank website.  Or whatever website.
As soon as it sense that those keys were typed, it starts paying attention to everything after, all the while sending ALL those keystrokes to someone else over the Internet.
After you enter your password, they have it.  All they have to do is log in and monitor your wallet for a balance.  The minute there is a balance, they "sweep" that balance into a new receive address in their wallet, and you're done.
You can NEVER use that wallet again.  Worse, you can never use that password again ANYWHERE.

I've been monitoring some old wallet addresses with relatively large balances.  When I see early adopters start cashing out, I'll be a bit more concerned about short-term pricing -- but when those old coins hit new wallets, it should increase demand over the long run.
My wallet monitoring app is pretty amateur, and I'm trying to figure out a way to monitor old defunct wallets (never spent coins) and old wallets that HAVE had activity but it has died down and old wallets that were defunct until recently but haven't fully liquidated.

Because it makes zero sense to drop the decimal at this stage in the game.
The power of bitcoin is in its non-inflationary (long term) nature.  Where the decimal falls is what will teach society the difference between a full reserve currency that can never be inflated and a fiat currency where new decimals can be added.
It is not our place to change bitcoin to make society happy -- the bastard voters who allowed the banking cartels to flourish should not be pandered to.
You want more people accepting it so your value goes up.  I understand that.  For me, I want people to accept what it is, and to not dilute an amazing thing.  Satoshi was way ahead of anyone else in the money field, and I honor him by not devaluing the decimal point.

I discussed this with some people who are registered MSBs.  Here's a problem:
Let's say you go to a website that allows non-BTC holders to pay for a product through an exchange.  The exchange has to (1) create a new account for the new user, (2) deal with KYC and AML laws for a user who might use BTC only once since they're not actually holding a BTC balance, and (3) deal with security issues like fraudulent banking info or chargebacks and (4) pay whatever transfer fees are involved for what could be a small transaction.
The vendor might even have to wait 45+ days for the BTC to be deposited while waiting for the fraud/chargeback deadlines to pass.
It's MUCH more complicated than it sounds.  Great idea, but no feasible way to do it, yet.

If I get a good price, I'll bankroll it and allow people to "pre-buy" for a really mediocre deposit (say, US$0.05 in BTC non-refundable) and then actually purchase if I get them for the price I think I can get them for.
I want them small enough to tote around or throw on the dashboard.  Already have a seamstress drawing the flat cut-lines so we can figure out how to lay them out so as to not waste fabric.  I told her do an MC Escher style pattern if possible, then there's zero waste!

In markets, nothing stabilizes.  It's not supposed to.  Prices should alway be in flux as people prioritize certain things and deprioritize other things.

1. Transaction delays are a killer.  I had two friends work towards accepting BTC, and both of them said the confirmation time wasn't worth it.  For my businesses, we don't ship a product for a few days minimum, so confirmation times aren't an issue.
2. Difficult to secure and understand security.  When more hardware wallets come out, I'm hopeful it will be easier to understand for the laymen.
3. Unknown tax liabilities.  Do we report our income as the BTC value the day we get it, and then pay capital gains on any gains from the point of receipt to the point of sale?  The regulatory rules are unknown.
4. Volatility scares people.  Look at the panic sellers on here, and look at the people who spent 150 BTC on an online game a year ago and their regrets today.
5. Anonymity scares customers away.  I am very happy to put my name and my reputation behind the products I sell online and in person.  But the vast majority of BTC vendors are really anonymous.  With no chargeback option, the average buyer seems fearful to part with their money.
All of these issues are being worked on.  All will be overcome.

Banks make most of their profits on fractional reserve banking -- they charge interest on the fake money THEY CREATE by providing debt/liquidity. 
Exchanges have a full reserve requirement.  As such, they either have to charge a VERY high exchange rate, or they have to reduce the service they can provide.
I disagree with you 10,000%.
**TL;DR** Banks provide "great service and security" by stealing from everyone's savings legally.

The ultimate bartering medium is both a money store and a currency.
Bitcoin has some intrinsic non-monetary value coming on the road ahead: colored coins, among other things.
My future foresees the need for "banks" to store actual BTC at a price (storage/insurance) and present competitive paper notes.  Yes, this can cause fractional banking to occur, but hopefully fast and instant withdrawals will put pressure on preventing fractional banking.
Open audits should also be an option.  If paper notes are created, they should be tied to auditable and open books.

Don't forget that people who have USD "stuck" in Gox are probably day trading as well -- that's a lot of money flowing into and out of BTC but then just sitting in fiat in a Gox ledger.
I don't see much purpose is arbitrage personally.  I've been involved in gold, silver and international currencies since the mid-90s and 100% of people I know who performed arbitrage all "made huge profits" on paper, but eventually got greedy and lost all their gains plus some of their nut.
If you have gambling money, it's better odds than Vegas -- but don't arbitrage with more than 20% of your available arbitrage capital.  If you have $100,000 in fiat sitting around, toss it on exchanges (all of them) and arbitrage no more than $20,000 at a time.

It's absolutely possible because you didn't define what "price" you mean.
The price of anything requires 2 different characteristics:
1. 2 items of value (say, bitcoin versus dollars)
2. A time frame of consideration ("right now" versus "an hour from now" versus "fifty years from now")
Is it possible for bitcoin to be super successful and go down in price?  Sure!  Example: technological hardware.  If the value of technology gains faster than bitcoin becomes more "valuable" overall, then the price of bitcoin will fall versus technology.

The only irreversible transactions right now are cash and bitcoin.  If you give someone cash, you can't get it back.  If you give someone bitcoin, you can't get it back.
If you buy something with a check, a wire transfer, a credit card, Paypal, or any other payment method but cash or bitcoin, you CAN reverse the payment.
Since cash and bitcoin are irreversible, does it make sense for someone to give you bitcoin for something you can later change your mind on?
Imagine if you sold a bitcoin to some random guy for paypal, and 15 days later he reverses the charges.  He has your bitcoin, AND he has his money.

As a vendor who accepts bitcoin on all my sites and local businesses, NO altcoin is acceptable to me at the current moment.
I am desperate to offer the opportunity for others to spend their altcoins, but it's a non-starter.  I have no less than 5 API-based bitcoin processing apps for my backend (Woocommerce).  None of the altcoins have ANY support for one of the biggest e-commerce solutions today.
I've asked on the subreddits and people are clueless.  If vendors don't accept altcoins easily, the altcoins have no value as a currency.

I agree with this -- but know there are two different types of merchants who accept BTC:
1. Merchants who immediately convert your BTC to fiat using a payment processor like BitPay.  When you spend your BTC on these merchants, they have to liquidate the BTC often on exchange markets -- liquidating your BTC for fiat puts downward pressure on prices.
2. Merchants who hold their BTC to redeem later, or only transact with other parties who accept BTC who also hold onto it rather than convert it to fiat.
My [t-shirt website]( (which accepts bitcoin and sells bitcoin t-shirts!) has taken the [Bitcoin Oath]( we will never sell our BTC for fiat, we will only use it with other merchants who commit to the same promise.

We've discussed this with hemp suppliers and it's too far out of our price range.
In Q1 2014 we're considering adding 2 upsell options for those who want it higher end, organic high quality cotton as well as white ink printing.
The problem is, both will double my prices from $7-9 to $14-$18.  Kinda screws up the 7bucktees situation, but all designs will always be available for $7, and the end buyer can select more expensive choices.
We add 1-2 new garment options per month, and I'm definitely going to offer a nice organic option in January.  Hemp maybe in spring.

1. It's possible, yes.  Banks report unexpected transactions to regulatory agencies all the time.
2. You are required to pay taxes on the gains.  Whether you do or don't is up to you and your aversion to legal risk, forfeiture and fine.
3. Transacting by selling to friends, or locally on localbitcoins.com, might be an option.

I have 2 ecommerce stores that have accepted BTC for just under 2 months.  One of the shops now does approximately 12% of sales as BTC.
If that one site would double in BTC income, I could either hire an extra helper (maybe pay him in BTC if interested), or just run the site 100% off BTC (but of course kill my overall profit).
The reason I think I can produce a profitable business accepting BTC is because we do all of our product production and fulfillment in-house.  I think bitcoinstore is outsourcing to someone else, and the margins aren't very good for them.
As a competitor of sorts to them, I hope they stick around -- the more companies out there, the more people who are interested in the product, and the more people will eventually find my sites.

If you don't have a lot of money to play with, but you don't want to be left behind, then do this (I recommend this to dozens or hundreds of people regularly):
1. Go out of your way every week and month to skip one non-essential activity that costs you money. Skip a cup of Starbucks a few mornings a week.  Skip buying one video game a month.  Skip 2 nights out at the bar.  Cook a dinner with your partner instead of going to dinner once a month.
2. Take that money you would normally spend and create a recurring auto-buy at Coinbase, or just buy bitcoin with it.
3. Do that buy either scheduled, or when you hit a milestone, say $10 or $50 or $100.
Stick to it, and don't panic sell.  Just buy slowly, over time, and don't worry about volatility.
Eventually, you'll either have a lot in bitcoin, or it'll be worth $0.

1. Start a bitcoin buying night at your house.  Charge people 5% over what YOU pay.  If you can get 20 friends to come over, you get your share "free".  People give you cash and you go and buy it all at once.
2. Sell services for bitcoin on -- there's also a new website called BitFiverr (I think).  I haven't used it.
3. Sell old junk you don't need on Craigslist and mention bitcoin.  If people inquire about it, offer to sell them bitcoin at 10% over the market rate, and rebuy what you need at Coinbase, etc.

Early adopters mined or bought bitcoins at an incredibly low price (dollars or energy/equipment).
At some point, those early adopters will liquidate.
When they do, the people who buy the bitcoin are NOT early adopters, so the risk of flushing/taking profits is reduced.
Expect this to continue until all "known and accessible" early bitcoin balances are rotated to new hands.

Depends on how it was sent and from where.
If you control the sending wallet, you can create a double spend transaction with fees which will cancel the old transaction out.
If you don't control the sending wallet, no clue.  I know there's a way to "push" a transaction through blockchain.info, but I have no idea how to do it.
I always use transaction fees.  Mining isn't profitable anymore, so why a miner would even consider accepting a zero fee transaction is beyond me.
If I mined, I would ignore them.  I don't work for free.

1. I've only been running 3 weeks -- my return so far as been 0.35BTC on an initial investment of 2BTC.  ROI is unlikely.  My "profit" comes from the fact that the share prices are still higher than realistic, so if I liquidated my shares today, I'd be up about 0.1BTC overall.  This number will surely fall.
2. I look at both BTC profit and USD profit, yes.  For me, BTC profit is what matters, otherwise buying and holding BTC is a better return for USD profit.

1. I'm sending one of my designers to go pick up the 4 garments.  He is leaving now and will be back in 2 hours. (The closest garment supplier is about 40 minutes drive each way)
2. I'm sending you a gift certificate for your original order total + $50, to try us again.
3. You will get a few updates via email when the garments arrive.  We normally do all our printing on our live stream but with super rush orders there isn't time to set it up so no video for you.  I DID tell my production manager to take photos of the shirts and email them to you as they're done.  
4. I will pin the tracking number to my browser so I can watch it get to you, and I will follow up with an email once it arrives (a day or two after).
If we can still get them to USPS today, I will send someone to drop them off at a post office.  I think they close in 3.5 hours so it will be close, but doesn't hurt to try.

3. For each user who wants to donate, let them type in their donation amount into a form, click submit, take them to a landing page that pulls the next receive address from the database (and delete that field entirely).  Tell them to donate to that address.  Store the address in the user_meta table attributed to $user_id.
4. When the database gets low on addresses, generate and add another 20 more.

I don't really see any problems here.
1. Coinbase is doing their job as a licensed exchange -- they have to make sure they're not just taking money out of an account that was hacked.  Numerous people have posted about this in regards to their first big order.  After emailing support, plenty of people seem to be fine with the results.  Personally I'm glad Coinbase does this.  I don't use Coinbase, but their security focus is a big reason I'm going to start.
2. You say you've heard good reviews over here at reddit.  That's interesting because I don't see many rave reviews -- people who are getting great service at Coinbase haven't been as vocal as the few who had exactly this happen to them.  I would estimate that at least 1-2 posts a day come through here about exactly this issue you had.  Have you not seen those posts?  I have. Daily.
3. The price at Coinbase will fluctuate like any exchange, based on who is selling and who is buying.  The 1-2% price difference is negligible.  If you want to get the best buy price, send money to EVERY exchange and sit and wait.
Why shouldn't Coinbase be presented to new users?  Because of these issues?  Every exchange has problems -- bitcoin is NEW to the banking industry, and these exchanges are new as well.  None of them expected the massive influx of curious parties, and they have to provide service to both actual customers AND new customers.  I'm sure coinbase is slammed.

Blockchain.info, as far as I know, doesn't have access to your wallet.  When you "login" what you're doing is actually opening your wallet on your PC through your web browser.

You didn't offend at all, just giving some good debate points, I hope!
As for statistics, bitcoin is like cash, not like publicly traded stocks.  Yes, the blockchain is public, but you never know if people are just shifting funds around between their own wallets.
I see great growth in bitcoin wallet owners, and I also see great diversification from those with large balances to those with none.
A friend here in Chicago minded a few thousand BTC over they years and he is now working on paying off all of his debt (home, car, CC, etc) slowly but surely.  So his 3000 BTC (or whatever) is down to (let's say) 2500 BTC, but the 500 BTC he sold locally is in the wallets of 500-1000 new people.
I see it, every day.

I consider myself a man of means -- not wealthy, but I've never been hurting for money.
Inflation does not hurt the wealthy if the wealthy are partaking in where that inflated money goes.
Consider who made money during the housing bubble -- created solely due to government inflation of the money supply via instigating low interest loans (debt is a source of new money).  Housing builders, realtors, banks.
When people can borrow easily, they will spend easily.  It's called malinvestment in the Austrian School.  Spending on useless things is a part of inflation's purpose: to push useless spending so that "jobs" can be created.  But those jobs don't last forever -- the poor who go to find a trade skill often run towards the latest bubble economy.  I know dozens of carpenters and roofers who were out of jobs for 3+ years after the housing bubble crashed.
The wealthy who got their 40% profit on top of the labor of the poor trademens are still wealthy, pouring their excess into being early adopters of the next bubble, whatever it may be (eco-friendly cars? hyperloops? private space missions?)
On the flip side, in a stable or deflationary economy, even the poor will see that a penny saved is a penny earned **plus**.  Spend 2 bucks on a bag of Doritos, or have $3 in value in a few years.  Malinvestment quiets down.
During an economy where people don't want to spend easily, businesses need investors to loosen their purse strings.  This happens by businesses needing capital showing willingness to pay higher interest loans.  Mortgages in the 1970s were as high as 19% for good credit holders.  19% for a home!  
My dad bought his first house with savings.  He bought his first car with savings.  My dad was a poor immigrant, right off the boat (literally), who was able to save enough in 10 years of hard work to buy a home and a car for cash.
Try finding a poor person who can save 10 years for a house now.  Or a middle class person.

The hackers can not extract the seed from the exchange server, so they can't access either the wallet nor the verification server.

This is what I'm currently using:
"Bitcoin is similar to an IOU system, but the IOUs are accepted by hundreds of thousands of people for their goods and service and even cash."
If they ask me to explain more, I give them something like this:
"If you want to sell 12 oranges, I can pay you with bitcoin IOUs that I received from someone else.  Then you can use those IOUs to buy something from someone else, or even buy cash with it.  The IOUs continue to move from person to person, gaining more value as more people trust them."

The good news it, it doesn't matter.
What matters is the velocity of how fast people trade bitcoin for goods or fiat currencies.  As the velocity goes up, the demand for bitcoin should also go up, and it'll ignore money that isn't moving.
This is how the market works -- supply and demand, and they meet at "price".  If bitcoin is moving around faster, it means there's a demand for bitcoin AND there's a demand to spend bitcoin.

Someone has no understanding of supply and demand.
Hoarders have a money velocity of 0.  Their money that isn't in motion has very little effect on the value of money in motion.
If they hoard, the active users of bitcoin set the price.  Hoarded money is basically ignored.
The minute the value is high enough for the hoarders to spend against, the spent money will not be in their wallets.
It will balance itself out regardless.  Someone could hoard 20 million BTC, and the remaining million in motion would work just fine.

And for me offering acceptance of alt-coins is a step in reducing them from pure speculation to a currency with market value.
I'm just one ecommerce site, but we're working hard behind the scenes to capture a strong market share in 2014.  We're also working on bringing more Paypal users to Bitcoin -- in 2014, we'll be offering strong discounts for BTC and also providing our users with some methods of acquiring it AFTER the sale is done but before the order ships (to give them the discount).  Since a typical order takes 8 business days to produce, that gives our customers time to hop on Coinbase, get verified, buy some bitcoin balance, transfer it to an address we provide them on-demand, and get their Paypal payment back.
Other businesses are taking your bitcoin and liquidating them to fiat the next day automatically.  We don't do that, ever.  We're working on getting suppliers/vendors/employees to accept bitcoin in lieu of fiat.

The most reasonable answer is: no one can know.  Markets are irrational.
My view?  A money currently is most liquid in the country it's based out of.  The money has value based on everything it can buy and that is for sale -- houses, plumbers, bananas, gold, alcohol, etc.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is showing liquidity internationally.  That means bitcoin eventually could be used to buy all of those things in any country.

Banks pay for customer service representatives with the money they steal from society legally.
Exchanges have to pay for customer service with profits which are remarkably lower when they can't steal from you and charge you interest on that theft.

If you buy 10 bitcoin at $100 each, you spent $1000, right?
Now let's say that bitcoin hits $150 each.  Your paper profits are $500.  So you sell 3.3333 bitcoin ( each) for $500. You've taken profits out.  You're back to owning $1000 in bitcoin, but you have 6.66666 invested.
If bitcoin goes to $250, you now have $1666.66 in value, plus $500 in cash.  So you sell 2.6666 bitcoin and have $1000 invested left (4 bitcoin), plus you have $1166 in taken profits.
If it goes to $320, you now have $1280 in value, plus $1166 in cash profits.  Sell 0.875 bitcoin and you're back to $1000 invested (3.125 bitcoins) and $1486 in cash profits.
That's what the hell I meant.

You don't run out of sellers.  That's a ridiculous premise.
If people want to buy, they will bid up the price, which will attract sellers.  If people don't want to sell at the current asking price, then there's a temporary equilibrium.

I remember selling my first printed t-shirt for around 1.6 BTC or so (can't remember the exact value, I should try to find the transaction) and thinking "I'm going to lose my shorts".
Then I had reprice that website (now long gone) to 0.5 BTC and thinking "This is it, people are going to flood me with orders and then I'll have nothing."
All of a sudden, I was charging just 0.25 BTC per shirt.  Orders picked up even more.  Felt good, but I was really spooked.
Not much longer, and I had seen my first order for a shirt at 0.10 BTC.  Yep, really creepy to think I was "getting so little" for a bundle of cotton with ink on it.
Moments ago, I received 0.016 BTC for a single shirt (withs shipping).
That's 1% of what my first shirt sold for, not near 2 years ago.  And I feel more confident than ever in that price.

My expectation was positive as long as I didn't have to cash-out in a hurry.  My trials showed that I should never trade more than 3% of my bankroll on any one exchange.
If I wanted to clear what I make hourly doing actual work, I would need a bankroll of around $1,500,000.  Doesn't make sense.

Yes, absolutely.  Because if people *en masse* weren't cool with it, the business would go under.


I have proof to the contrary, scientific evidence, but I won't qualify your assumption.


Sure they have.  The ones that haven't are the ones that are no longer around.  The exchanges that are growing have proven that they're taking care of the vast majority of customers just fine.
| The fact that you think exchanges are in any way forced to maintain 100% reserves when there's swathes of people content to leave not-insignificant funds on there,
Understand that I am likely significantly more intelligent than you, and likely have much more experience in the business world and in the regulatory world.  In fact, it's a given.
If a bitcoin exchange does not provide for near 100% reserves, they will go under the moment there's a bank run.  Since Coinbase actually shows people their wallet address, you can not assume they're *not* segregating funds properly, and providing a full reserve.  The evidence is in the blockchain.
Now, I typically don't get into heated and drawn out discussions with anonymous cowards, so if you'd like to continue this conversation, put your real name and reputation on the line.
Otherwise, you can GFY.  I've provided enough information for this thread for the intelligent reader to understand that my opinion on this matter is correct, and I will leave you with a recap:
**If you can not weather the risk in bitcoin, go away until the risk is reduced.**  Yes, you'll lose out on reward opportunities, but it leaves more of the pie for guys like me who can actually afford the risk.

I imagine they, like most modern companies, track the cost of service per transaction.
I have a business where our minimum order is $150.  The average cost to transact, including customer service, is about $35.  If I get a $500 sale, the cost is about $35.  If I had a $25 sale, I'd lose a ton.  So we set it to $150, which covers a minimum profit.
The rising bitcoin price has probably shown them that selling small amounts and have to deal with service on those amounts isn't profitable.  So they're letting the rising price of bitcoin bump up the minimum to keep them in the black.

Name a commodity or financial vehicle that as all of these:
1. Easy to transfer across any boundaries
2. Easy to recognize, difficult to counterfeit
3. Rare
4. Extremely divisible
Once you realize that there is no other commodity (other than other cryptocurrencies) like bitcoin, the volatility makes sense because every new market that comes to discover bitcoin will put 2 pressures on the price directions: (1) long term savings/value transfer, and (2) speculation.
When China bounced in, the price went up.  Will India create the same boom, and will it be speculative or savings?
I hope volatility NEVER goes away.  The fact that bitcoin's price can be instantly discovered is an amazing and important market force.  No other commodity or currency has ever had such as fast price discovery, in all of the world's history.

The 3% protects your bankroll.
Imagine if you had $5000 to play arbitrage with.  We know, for a fact, that some exchanges are difficult to withdraw from -- and no exchange is "simple and quick".
So you toss $2500 on ExchangeA and $2500 on ExchangeB.  Trading at 100% or even 50% means you WILL MISS TRADES while your capital is being cashed out to swap to the exchange that needs it.
If you play with $150 on ExchangeA and $150 on ExchangeB, you have $2250 on each exchange for future trades, and to cover the amount of time it takes to rebalance your exchanges.

The internet wasn't a rare commodity.  Anyone could start a web company for $30 in domain registration and hosting -- and many did.
Bitcoin is a rare commodity.  If a powerful entity tries to control it, the price will skyrocket.
You can get a loan for $1MM and go out and start 33,000 websites today, running news articles through parser translators to create "new" news articles on each website.  That's basically how HuffPo makes their money.
You can't get a loan for $1MM and just buy $1MM worth of BTC in a day.  The market would see the demand to buy and the prices would skyrocket.  It would likely take a long time for a $1MM investment to buy slowly at a reasonable rate.  And $1MM won't do a hill of beans against a $3B market of value.

This game will continue, too.  You'll have pump and dumpers who will engage in fast buys and sells, and you'll have buys and holds.
This is all great for the bitcoin economy as a whole.  We need people who are willing to "make the market" for bitcoin -- both short term investors, long term investors, and people using it as an actual bartering medium ("money").

Spend some time in search bar for sure.
1. Yes, bitcoin transactions and balances are stored in a P2P ledger.
2. Public addresses can be changed by you at any time.  Private key never changes.  Public address is derived from your private key.
3. Whoever has the private key can tell the P2P ledgers to empty the balance.
4. For now this is the case, but there are apps being worked on to allow for funds transfers without an active internet connection.  Basically the sender and receiver have snapshots that allow for a soft confirmation of funds, and when they sync, the ledgers are updated.  Some people use a separate private key wallet for fast transactions (hot wallet) and store their big balance on a separate private key cold wallet.
5. See 
6. You generate your own private key yourself, and that key generates nearly "unlimited" public keys that point to your balance sheet.  The risk of collisions (making a private key identical to someone else's) is unlikely and would take longer than the age of the universe to happen by chance or even by attempts.

I run 5 tiny shops that don't do $500,000 a year in total.  They all accept bitcoin.  I've been getting anywhere from 10 to 50 emails *per day* inquiring about bitcoin, not about what I offer.  It's almost unsustainable for me to keep a customer service person on hand just to respond to those emails (and the responses, when we specifically ask them not to respond if it's not about our offerings).
I can't imagine what Coinbase, or any large vendor/exchange, has to put up with.  They've hired more CSRs, they're whitelisting people fast, and I'm not seeing any repeat offenses against the same buyer.
I like what they offer.  I just signed up last week, made my first purchase, and if it's rejected -- so be it.  There were weeks of warnings here, and I'll just request a white listing and move on.

I use BitPay.
They support refunds to customers if the merchant approves a refund and if the merchant sends BTC to their BitPay wallet.
If a merchant converts BTC to fiat automatically, it is likely the merchant doesn't have BTC available to refund, or they've tied up the fiat money in supply sourcing.
Don't confuse Bitpay's refund option with a refund mandate.  If a merchant's TOS says no refunds, then there is no refund.

It isn't a bots war.
The exchanges are not tied to each other.  Very, very, very few people are capable of doing arbitrage between exchanges, but there is a tiny amount of pressure trying to bring some equality to price.
Because there are many exchanges, you have many different people trying to buy at a low price and people trying to sell at a high price.
Many competitive exchanges is great for the market.  There's a reason "normal" stocks are sold on only one exchange: control.
The prices will fluctuate as people liquidate for a profit, or need to raise fiat capital, or want to invest in bitcoin short term, or want to buy into it long term.

Both my business bankers (national big banks) confided in me in November that they're actually concerned for the first time in their lives.
The bank bubble didn't concern them.  Bailouts.
You can't bail out inflation.  If the Fed cuts QE, the fake economy built around previous QE will collapse.  The banks want to sit on higher reserves, which will reduce M(v) significantly.

It won't, according to the consultant I hired (he helps open banks, professionally).
The banking industry doesn't want competition like that.  Their power is derived from the lax requirements on deposits and reserves.
What started off as a fractional reserve banking system is now practically a no-reserve banking system.  Try to open a bank that is full reserve, and other banks won't be happy.
On top of that, banks make money because of the no/low reserve requirement.  A bank that deposits in BTC would have to have VERY high fees to cover their overhead, insurance, etc.
Would you be willing to pay upwards of $50 a month for a bank in BTC?  On top of that, would you be willing to pay upwards of $10 to see a teller, or $5 to use an ATM, or as much as $25 just to call them for a balance?

I don't particularly value BTC right now because most vendors convert it to fiat after a purchase is made.  I don't want to buy from them.  All my businesses that accept BTC refuse to convert to fiat -- see: [Bitcoin Oath]( -- and I'd like to redeem BTC towards other vendors who also don't convert to fiat.

Although I'm a harsh capitalist, I don't really believe in usury.  The way I saw it, someone was in need, I had excess capital, and if I lost that capital (some or all), it would be a fine way for me to set that person's reputation for future dealings.
They ended up paying me back at par, so it didn't matter either way.  I was out the capital for a few months, and price basically ended up near where it was a few months earlier, and all was good in the world.

I've been accepting BTC for payment for over a year, and my personal valuation has always been "what percentage of my customers want to pay in BTC".  Right now, in ecommerce, it's about 7% trend average.  Not too bad.  In consulting, it's 4%.  Overall average is about 4.5% of my income comes in the form of BTC.
I came up with the $185 valuation based on what my expected "break even" ground is on previous income, the slight upward trend in people picking BTC over USD, and what I believe is a safe market value overall.
From a pure speculation perspective, I'm sure people find value at $700-$900 but my books don't show that to me.  When I accept BTC at that valuation, I think (in the short term!) I'm underselling myself, since I don't convert BTC to fiat.  But in the long term, it's not even 5% of my income, so if I lose out, no big deal.  I doubt BTC will ever go to zero, and I doubt we'll even see below $200 again.
A wise man once told me to figure your net worth to be 50% of what you think it is.  So if I think BTC is worth $185 to me, I'd say my brain is really saying that $370 is a realistic market price at the moment, and we are overheated to the tune of 100% that value.
That being said, I believe BTC's price will have an upward trend continuously.  So if you buy at $750 today, I'm sure the market reality will meet that price eventually as a stable point.
Of course, what I value BTC for and what you value BTC for are vastly different.  I know my costs to live, I know what I should need in the future, and I know what my political motives are for seeing BTC become common.  You may have different values for all 3.

4 LTC = $16 = 0.03 BTC.

If you're the kind who jumps out during a short term devaluation, I don't think either makes a lot of sense.  You can't get rich quick on a few dollars worth of anything quickly.  Even the millionaires had to wait 2-3 years -- and there were a LOT of ups and downs that other people sold out at.

I won't say that EITHER can be beneficial for ALL poor people, but the reality of economics is that inflation has created a glass ceiling for most poor people today versus how it was 100 years ago.
The middle class is getting ravaged due to their inability to save.  I have "middle class" friends right now who are in their 30s and don't have even 2 weeks of savings.  They'll "live on credit cards" is what they tell me.
And why do those credit cards even exist?  Inflation source.
Look at bitcoin right now -- I'm talking to "poor" people who bought their first 0.1 BTC and they're not spending it -- because they see value in it tomorrow.  Yes, 100% gains in 2 weeks will tempt anyone, but I am betting it'll still happen even with 20% gains annually.
Only one way to find out -- and before bitcoin, there wasn't another deflationary currency for over a hundred years, if not longer.
Inflation pays for wars, it pays for entitlements that keep the poor "happy", it pays for intergenerational wage slavery, and it definitely helps the wealthy beget more wealth.

You can't change bad laws when all laws are bad.  Creating new laws will only create new entitlements "at best".  The problem I have with modern feminism is that it assumes there can be forced equality.
A woman's worst enemy is another woman, not men.  It's insane to think otherwise.  Just look at the cattiness factor when a prettier girl walks in a room.
I'm not a PUA, I don't believe people should be forced to do anything they don't want to do, but the more the law "sides" with women, the less valuable women will be to society.  It's hard enough to hire a woman of child-bearing age, considering the insane costs of FMLA.

Welcome to the fun of making a bitcoin transaction.  Brian or Brad or Tony from the shop will contact you within 2 hours if they don't see your payment confirmation come through.  At that point, they'll turn you over to me since I maintain the wallet the funds go to.

I'll disclose this based on the hope that it won't get leaked too majorly, but I don't mind to publicize it a bit.
Since summer, we've been using a separate garment printer to stain with ink we make in-house.
The output is terrible right now, but there's a lot of hope.
We used fresh blueberries to make a blue-ish stain, we used concentrated coffee to get a deep brown (almost black) stain, bloodwort from the southwest to make a red dye, and we're stuck on yellow for now so we skipped it.
The initial results were terrible -- no contrast, not much saturation.  But we've been reading on "ancient" garment dying techniques, and applying a saline pre-spray to the garment seems to allow the colors to come out stronger.
I spoke with a native american in fall and she said they used to use cow urine to get colors to pop, but I don't think we'll be doing that.  Still, it's a long term goal of mine.
Imagine using inks that are not just 100% natural, but 100% made in-house.  It's a game changer, for the markets that don't mind paying a little extra.
Personally, I wouldn't say I'm the most eco-conscious guy on the planet, but in an industry that loves plastisol, I'm doing my part.  I HATE platisol.  If you want to see truly criminal negligence, go to any screen print shop and see what they do with their plastisol remnants.  Right down the drain.  That stuff is toxic.
Another popular trend is using discharge ink.  Look up the MSDS on that stuff.  I won't touch those jobs, but other shops will.  And it's truly horrid.
The future for me is the same as the past: find niche markets, provide an excellent product at a reasonable price.  Focusing on people who want environmentally friendly garments is a goal for me, but it's definitely a slow moving process.

Fine, have your site use the blockchain [receive address api] (
Now they don't do any address generation whatsoever.  When your site gets the callback, it validates their donation automatically.
They don't need to use a blockchain wallet even!  Cold storage is fine.

I created a simple Google Doc spreadsheet with theoretical buys and sells across multiple exchanges.
As long as you have plenty of fiat overhead, and can focus on light gains versus huge wins, there's money to be made.
The downside is the overhead bank you need versus trade amount -- it isn't worth it for me to tie up so much for so little.  $50+ an hour average is easier made by working hard at what I love doing than sitting around being woken up by arbitrage opportunity alarms.

I have been generally buying amounts equal to what I've been earning in BTC through selling products or my consulting services.
If I sell 1BTC worth in a day, I also buy an additional BTC.  It's a good method of forcing myself to stay in the game, but also earning BTC for work I do.

You're very wrong.
Money is not defined as a store of value, but as a medium for exchange "at that moment".
Money needs to be fungible, recognizable, easy to transport/transfer, divisible, and rare.
Store of value isn't part of the definition.
See: Rothbard's WHGDTOM.

The best way I would do it is:
1. Wordpress
2. Woocommerce (FREE) -- supports digital downloads
3. Coinbase plugin (FREE) -- I believe Coinbase is waiving fees, and it's near instant confirmation from Coinbase wallets.
That's how I recommend it.  Takes 10 minutes or less to install.

TL;DR -- yes, it will.
Long answer: I have friends just a little older than me who JUST got their first cell phones.  I have friends a little younger than me who won't use a tablet.  Bitcoin is not for our grandparents.  Some may understand it.  Most won't care.
Bitcoin is not even for guys my age (40) -- most of my friends are too afraid about their retirement funds to take any risk whatsoever.
Bitcoin is for the future.  Be glad you're in on the ground flood.  I was using the Internet before 9600 baud modems were standard -- it was a wild ride, lots of fun, lots of money to be made, and MANY people said "it's just too difficult to learn".
I was at the front and center of the laser printer days, too.  I had dozens of (business consulting) firms, HUGE companies, who refused to give up dot matrix.  "Powdered toner?  That sounds like a health risk."
Stop worry about the older generation and start looking at the bigger picture:  Technology isn't just about becoming easier to use, society has to become accustomed to using technology as well.
Then again, people still use **password123** on their bank logins...

If I was hoping to sell tomorrow, I would tell you to buy to be part of the wave pushing the price up for me.
If I was hoping to buy tomorrow, I would tell you to wait, in hopes that others would also wait, and let the price fall for me.
There is no crystal ball.  The news says there are heavy hitters coming into bitcoin, so expect there to be buying pressure (raises prices), but we also have a year end coming, and people sell positions to take profits to pay taxes -- so there could be a price lowering factor.
Risk what you can afford to risk, don't panic sell, set a goal for gains and losses, and stick to that goal.

I have 0.25 BTC invested -- just to test out Coinbase and see if they screwed me over (they didn't).
The rest of my BTC isn't invested, it's BTC I've earned over a year of selling my goods and services for BTC.
That total?  I don't even know -- I create a new offline/paper wallet for every 10 BTC I earn, and store the wallets somewhere safe until I want to buy something.

Take a cash advance on your credit card, if you need to use credit.
