My version: "life is a set of probabilities".
Once you accept that, accepting things in life become much easier. My existence, my past, me typing this very message, all probabilities that have accumulated over millennia leading to this very moment.
After I started viewing life as such, accepting the fact that I had fuck ups become more palatable: I played the odds with insufficient information and got it wrong, next time I'll try to get the odds on my favors (although chance of failure still exists).
I wanted to buy BTC when it was $10. I was too poor to afford it back then and thought it was stupid. Here I am today, never bought bitcoin and now living quite okay financially. I could have had 100K more money today, but it doesn't matter, I couldn't have foreseen this with the information I had. I just made sure to bust my ass out of poverty through other choices I knew more about.
EDIT: Thank you kind stranger for popping my gold cherry! I hope that getting gilded means that this comment has been helpful and useful to someone out there. If anyone going through this thread feels like they need someone to talk to, feel free to send a PM my way. Have a great week everyone!

Can anyone ELI5? I'm interested in making small investments to learn.

House money makes it easy to risk it, because if you ignore the idea of opportunity cost, he technically already made profit and loses nothing from his initial investment.

Yeah it was on LinkedIn and from different accounts.

The thing about logarithmic scale is that it's used to observe percent change rather than $ change. Let's say you bought in at $1, not it's $2, so you doubled your money.
Now let's say you bought at $1001, now it's $1002. On a linear scale the increase is the same, but you only made cents.
In a log-scale; $1 to $2 is the same as $1000 to $2000, i.e. same increase in your investment.
