You have several options. 
You mentioned Savings Account. What you could do is go to  buy shares, and sit on them for nice payouts that arrive once a week. The more shares you buy, the more dividends you receive. When you are ready to cash out, simply sell the shares back.
Don't gamble with BTC. Or virtually with real money anyway. Just grab a copy of Hoyle Casino 2012 if you feel the urge to gamble.
Don't invest into anymore mining equipment. In a few months from now, ButterflyLabs will be releasing PC hardware that will bring today's GPUs to its knees.
I personally just play with the market. Buy low, sell high. It's very tedious however, and I don't recommend doing it if you're not willing to endure a whole lot of inevitable stress.
