Can they charge back if it is a direct transfer so that the money is wired instantly to the persons account?
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:30:54
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:03:03
Yes multiple transactions is properly the road I'm gonna take. Might not reach those 2000 btc since I have to ditch that library computer quickly after ahaha

I need a trusted dealer with good reputation 
Drop some links
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:00:57

It says that I have to come to his office on his page. And I don't live in America but I check Localbitcoins out :) Thx again
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:05:05
I see it makes sense tho. All you're serious answers made me a bit smarter on bitcoins. Fucking so many trolls tho
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:21:25
And do you happened to know a shady (but 100% trusted) Bitcoin dealer who doesn't care about where the money is coming from?
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:34:23
YES! Finally a serious answer! Thank you!
Ok, so they can actually charge back even if it is bitcoins? (I'm fairly new to all this Bitcoin thing)
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:38:17
Do you have a website? Then no
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:20:47
I already got the money on the CC. Just need a 100% trusted bitcoin seller that requires no ID or verification
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:52:57
Haha :D We got our own systems in europe I'm not worried about american interference 
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:17:49
Omg I'm not trolling! I got the money on the credit card. I just want it in Bitcoins, so any websites that requires no ID or verification that can handle that large amount of Bitcoins? (2000)
If you can't answer the question then fuck off. Serious answers only. Thank u
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:27:35
Go away I need serious answers
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:51:08
That is exactly what I want to. Disappear with the bitcoins so given that I don't care about chargebacks or police is this possible for me?
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:42:02
739$ Per Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:51:44
I can't buy bitcoins locally in my country unfortunately. Not as widespread as in America
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:05:50
Yes indeed I'm very serious
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:30:22
I'M NOT GIVING MY 1.5 million $ to someone on Reddit! OK?! I'm not stupid. I want a 100% trusted website or dealer with good reputation and who does it with no verification noir id it is as simple as that!!! 
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:53:44
Thx for the link! I check it out
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:49:29
I'm not American no IRS here or any fancy shit
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:24:27
Yes you're right. So I can have like different wallets with 10 BTC but all on the same account? Or?
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:46:01
Ok it makes sense then. Guess I have to buy from individual people properly 1 BTC at a time until I reach my target
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:23:45
How would you even know tho
Go away if you don't wanna answer serious
