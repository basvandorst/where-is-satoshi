I went to the Haight St location and the guy at the register seemed pretty on the ball, but for some reason their POS wasn't showing the transaction going through even though on my account it showed up as completed.

Isn't this vulnerable to the [same kind]( of physical attack as the Casascius?

While I do agree that the Silk Road is doing more harm than good, I also can see a rise in pornography sites accepting bitcoin. There are already people trying to make a profit this way with the subreddits like (**NSFW** obviously) and it absolutely makes sense. It's (mostly) anonymous and will not show up on credit card statements, plus the operators don't have to deal with credit card fees. They are another type of small business that has a lot to gain from bitcoin and they operate on the web where it is easiest to promote and use. Yes of course this will also cause negative media because that's how most of the press portrays anything sexual, but at the same time the porn industry is very often a trendsetter when it comes to new tech.

On a side note, I was doing it all through an iPhone and the proprietary QR code scanner I was using doesn't copy to the clipboard which made it a huge hassle to enter into my online coinbase account. Any suggestions for streamlining the process for me?
