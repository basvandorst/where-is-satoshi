Yea! I came too came for the lambos, but stayed for the decentralization! RAWR!!
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:42:14
Yes, Bitcoin is like our baby...no reason to freak out each time it gets attacked by rabid dogs...our baby is unstoppable...lol...........

I remember this meme peaked during the BTC surge from 5k to 10k!
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:43:33
I am in LA area...I am also interested...
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:43:46
Exactly, he doesn't care about morals. The dollar doesn't care about morals, and now Bitcoin doesn't care about morals. If you dig just a little bit, you could almost hear Warren Buffet buying Bitcoin right now...makes you think, doesn't it?

What? I don't understand
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:20:02
People complain about the fees, I get that, but I'm not letting that get in the way of my gains. I'm confident in this technology and am only disappointed in myself at the end of the day...just looking to see if anybody would like the same options as me on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:58:11
How can I effectively explain that I understand this? Guess I should have not posted this... also, I have been told that I was likely to fuck myself when I caught the BCH bull run and likely to fuck myself on the Ripple 22 cent to 75 cent bullrun....I was very successful in those captures, but this one I might likely fuck myself :)

Thanks for the in-depth advice! Everyone here seems to be many steps ahead of me, honestly this is really fun learning-I haven't been this excited about something since the internet surfaced for me in 1998.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:20:08
LMAO We're in the for the long hall boys (April maybe?)

That's like saying, "you don't know if you're going to get hit by a car tomorrow, the day after that, or next year."
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:46:53
I was totally aware they were high, as I've seen people pay hundreds of dollars to buy and sell, but I didn't know the sending as well...also I greatly underestimated the rationalizing of the fees...I figured sending $20 might cost me $5 at the most...definitely learned a lesson.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:01:41
You could set you transaction fee lower on Coinbase when sending? I don't mind it taking a day if that is the case.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:57:37
I know that, thanks. I was looking for people with the same issue, obviously nobody has this same frustration. Thank you all, seriously!
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:19:46
I love that N*Sync song!
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:09:02
Wait, we're not immortal? Seriously? A DDOS attack? What's next Bitcoin miners getting SWATTED?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:16:13
I would simply like to purchase my coin and have it, I don't want to wait 7 days. What if I'm totally confident that the futures will gain for just 3 days and then seriously dip after that? I'm not going to be happy with my BTC I bought today when BTC is worth $10k by the time it arrives -_-
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:43:42
You're jumping off the right foot, I'll give you that, but I believe Bitcoin is consuming vast sums of ALL CURRENCIES simply because the $USD (fedcoin) is currently the world's reserve currency and has been for quite some time now.

Solid upvote, majority of newcomers will gravitate towards this post, keep the questions coming and the answers will rise above. God Bless Reddit!
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:24:09
Maybe just say $100 worth at this point...but I completely agree there should be a sticky stating this at the top.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:38:16
Fuck yes, this post is everything to me!
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:43:55
LINK PLS?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:35:43
Great comment-well said.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:45:59
Nominal post! Love it!
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:27:49
What if a loaf of bread is 100,000 Bitcoin then?
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:59:26
Wait, what? Is Coinbase going on Winter-break? I buy today using my debit card on Coinbase and get my Bitcoin IMMEDIATELY, no exaggeration...This post is confusing at the root.......
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:08:59
Damn! Did it really ?
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:34:56
Nice to know, thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:46:22
First of all, you need to learn the five D's of dodgeball...
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:52:35
Let's go!!!! But damn, how much were the fees? $25k?
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:03:44
Right, this
