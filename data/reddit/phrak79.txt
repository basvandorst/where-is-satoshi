We take a look at Bitcoin, Bitcoin is not having the characteristics of these currencies? As far as I know, the vast majority of countries do not recognize the Bitcoin currency status. Currency in circulation in addition to the media, the value of scale functions, there is a very important function is denominated instruments. Bitcoin itself is not denominated in the currency, nor as the quote currency is possible. Plunged wild speculation "currency" can be used as currency it? Bitcoin transactions for good, good investment, you need to pay attention to its risk. People's Bank and the relevant departments will continue to focus on the movements of Bitcoin and associated risks, strengthen the monitoring, analysis, and guide the public to establish a correct concept of money and investment philosophy. Thank you.






Bitcoin is a specific virtual goods. What I understand is called money? The first is the medium of exchange currency is widely accepted by society as a whole medium for the exchange of commodities. Monetary developments in the history of thousands of years, once the physical currency, the final form of physical currency is gold and silver. Like Marx said natural gold is money. The most essential characteristic of money is a medium of exchange and measure of value. Itself to be valuable, so it can be denominated. Since gold production is limited, it can not meet the growing social and economic development, so the gold standard collapsed. From the later seventies of last century, the world monetary credit system completely behind monetary credit system is a powerful force of national credit and forced the country, so we put the national currency, credit currency called legal tender.

Thanks for the form letter, bit I fundamentally disagree with your position. 
Here's what I've written:
*Dear Mr/s &lt;member or senator&gt;,*
*The ATO recently released a draft ruling regarding the taxable treatment of bitcoin in Australia.*  
*Bitcoin is a type of digital currency that essentially operates as online cash. Bitcoin operates as a decentralised peer-to-peer payment network designed to reinvent the way that money works.*  
*Bitcoins are already widely used for in-person and online purchases. Bitcoin can be acquired by exchanging 'national' currencies (e.g. AUD) for them through an online exchange or through a Bitcoin ATM, or by accepting them as a gift or in exchange for goods and services.*
*The draft ruling treats bitcoins akin to a barter arrangement, with similar tax consequences.*
*I commend the ATO on providing clear and intelligent guidance on bitcoin treatment.*  
*I believe the Australian Tax Office’s draft ruling is mostly fair and reasonable, however I find one main point highly concerning.*  
*That is:*  
*&gt;A transfer of bitcoin is a 'supply' for GST purposes.*
*This effectively means that bitcoins will be double-taxed when used for purchases in Australia.*  
*GST will first be charged on the initial bitcoin acquisition. GST will then also be charged when using bitcoins to purchase goods or services.*
*Bitcoin acquisition should be exempt from GST in the same way that foreign currency purchases are exempt.*  
*We currently pay GST on the service fee to acquire the currency, but not on the capital outlay.*
*The ATO's ruling will create unnecessary paperwork and red-tape. It's an unfair burden on the legitimate users of bitcoin in Australia.*  
*This ruling is not in the best interests of Australians and will put the Australian economy at a major disadvantage compared to more favourable jurisdictions.*
*In these early days of such a exciting and revolutionary new technology, the ATO must allow a GST exemption to the supply of bitcoin for the Australian digital economy to reap bitcoin's full benefits.*
*Kind regards,

THE race to launch Australia's first Bitcoin ATM is entering its final stages.
The machines have been shipped and two firms — Australian Bitcoin ATMs and Krypto Currency Solutions — have confirmed to AAP they will each install one in Sydney's CBD within weeks, possibly days.
A representative for Australian Bitcoin ATMs said the company's first machine is scheduled for installation in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall “before the end of March”.
Krypto Currency Solutions CEO Robert Masters said his company's first machine would be operational “within two weeks” of last Wednesday.
He would not provide an exact location, saying only that it would be somewhere in Sydney's CBD.
Both machines are understood to have been bought from RoboCoin, the US firm credited with providing the world's first Bitcoin ATM, which appeared in a Vancouver cafe in October.
They cost about $US20,000 ($A22,169) according to Robocoin's website.
Australian Bitcoin ATMs said it is also working with Israeli and Canadian suppliers, with plans to rollout thousands of ATMs worldwide if the initial run is a success.
By putting miniature Bitcoin exchanges on street corners, the operators are hoping to take the volatile digital currency further into the mainstream.
“We want to make it more accessible to the general public,” Masters said.
“Hopefully in due time a lot more people will become aware of Bitcoin and the value it holds.” Existing online exchanges and brokerages are fine for tech-savvy early adopters, said RoboCoin CEO Jordan Kelley in an email — but his focus is on bringing Bitcoin to the remaining “99 per cent”. “I want my grandma owning Bitcoin. I want people in Australia remitting money to their family in the Philippines by walking up to a RoboCoin (ATM) and sending Bitcoin.” Associate Professor David Glance, director of the Centre for Software Practice at the University of Western Australia, isn't so convinced.
He said while the ATMs may give Bitcoin more real-world presence, they will still appeal largely to tech-savvy enthusiasts. “It will be a boon for people who are interested in it, but I don't believe for a second that it will spur the market on to the average man in the street.
“It's still too complicated.” Prof Glance said Bitcoin would likely break into the mainstream only if a major respected player, such as Google, were to embrace it. This would simplify the digital currency and lend it much-needed credibility.
Nevertheless, the impending rollout of the ATMs is the latest sign of Bitcoin's increasing presence in Australia, as local entrepreneurs jockey to get into the digital currency market early. Earlier this month, Perth multi-millionaire Zhenya Tsvetnenko listed his own Bitcoin enterprise, Digital CC Holdings, on the ASX — one of the first listings on a major stock exchange of a Bitcoin-related company.
Digital CC trades the digital currency on behalf of clients though a service called digitalBTC. It is also developing a Bitcoin debit card and mobile apps that will enable customers to hold digital currencies in a virtual wallet.
“We think that digital currencies are the future,” Tsvetnenko said in an email.
Bitcoin could be “a major global currency”, he said, allowing users to “transact across borders without the complication of exchange rates, banks and other intermediaries and fees.” The imminent arrival of Bitcoin ATMs come a matter of weeks after hackers robbed the high-profile Mt. Gox exchange of 850,000 Bitcoins worth about half-a-billion Australian dollars.
The attack ruined Mt. Gox, which prior to the attack was reportedly handling up to 70 per cent of the world's Bitcoin transactions.
Prof Glance said digital currencies have had “issues and hiccups” since their inception, yet have consistently managed to rebound and stabilise.
The advantages of digital currencies meant they would be around in one form or another for a long time, he added.
“The real question is whether Bitcoin will ever achieve the kind of stability that will allow it to be used as a currency, as opposed to what it's used for at the moment: an investment vehicle.”

What's the practical difference? The requirement is to record the source of the transaction, be that from one or multiple sources.

**Australian Tax Treatment of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies**
**Status**:  
Consultation completed  
**Purpose**  
To seek input from a business community perspective about the impacts of differing taxation treatments of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies on the Australian business community.
**Description**  
Industry representatives from professional and Bitcoin associations, and leading businesses involved in the emerging Bitcoin community, met on 29 April 2014. Attendees provided valuable information about their business models and how different tax treatments would impact their clients, members and businesses.
**Who we consulted**  
Industry representatives from profession and Bitcoin associations.
**Outcomes**  
The group provided valuable feedback on ATO propositions that have been part of our deliberations for an Australian position on this tax treatment. We have sought further advice from external legal counsel, which has delayed the release of the guidance paper. It remains our priority to provide the community with the final guidance paper in time for people to complete their 2013–14 income tax returns. The key information that a taxpayer will need about each transaction or event with Bitcoin is the date, the amount in $A, what it was for, and who the other party was (their Bitcoin address, at a minimum).

Melbourne-based bitcoin fund lost $70,000 in a cyber-attack caused by US Marshals Service
Tuesday, 01 July 2014
A mistake by the US Marshals Service has led to Melbourne-based bitcoin arbitrage fund Bitcoins Reserve losing 100 bitcoins, valued at around $70,000, in a cyber-attack, according to co-founder Sam Lee.
Lee’s contact details, along with the details of others interested in the auction of 30,000 bitcoins confiscated from the Silk Road black marketplace, were accidently leaked by the US Marshalls Service about two weeks ago.
Bitcoins Reserve was the victim of what Lee calls “a serious attack”, where an individual approached him on the leaked email address, purporting to be a journalist requesting an interview.
Lee says the address the attacker used was owned by a third party, which he believes has been compromised by the attacker, and used to share with him a Google Doc with what Lee believed to be interview questions.
He was then prompted with an input which required him to request access to Google Doc, but the link was actually requesting access to his own email account.
Once the attackers had gained access to his email account they were able to complete a password challenge, which then gave the attacker access to all the plain text passwords in his chrome web browser.
They then accessed Bitcoins Reserve’s domain register, added a new DNS record that confirmed with Google that they had ownership of the company’s Google apps admin account.
Through that they were able to access the email addresses of all the employees at Bitcoins Reserve.
They couldn’t gain direct access to Bitcoins Reserve’s bitcoins, Lee says, because it’s handled by a security expert “and they’re all locked down”.
Instead they sent an email from Lee’s email address, purporting to be him, to the company’s chief technology officer, requesting that 100 bitcoins be sent to a specific bitcoin address.
Lee says “naturally” the CTO’s response was to request a phone call from the attacker purporting to be Lee, to confirm that it was in fact Lee making the request, the attacker responded saying that’s fine, but the phone call would have to be later that afternoon as he was busy.
The CTO then called Lee’s co-founder and CFO who authorised the transaction, who mistakenly thought they were fulfilling an internal client withdrawal request.
In an unfortunate coincidence, Lee was busy on the morning of the attack, and unable to answer his mobile, which made the attackers claims more credible.
“Is it the US Marshals’ fault that the attack occurred? Absolutely! Is it their fault that we lost some Bitcoins? No,” Lee says.
“Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and the untraceable nature of it attracts very high profile hackers to jump on board and try to add to their incomes.”
Lee says he has spoken to other individuals whose details were also leaked by the US Marshals Service, who say they were also targeted.
“It’s supposed to be a confidential auction, they leaked the list, the hackers have got their hands on the mail list and made a very sophisticated attack revolving around this list,” he says.
“But people losing bitcoins could only because of their own lack of security procedures.
“I’m glad it’s happened sooner rather than later, as it’s made us aware of our vulnerabilities.
“It lets us know about our weaknesses in these kinds of areas.
“Bitcoin in general is such a new industry, things are happening at a lightening pace, and security gets left on the wayside and we leave our doors open to such social engineering, because these things happen so quickly.”
Lee says the individuals behind the attack followed it up with a blackmail attempt, requesting a further 200 bitcoins to ensure Lee’s last seven years of email correspondence isn’t leaked.
He says, they’ll cover the losses “out of our own pockets” and have no plans to contact Police, because he doesn’t believe there’s much they could do.
The attack had limited impact on the Bitcoins Reserve arbitrage fund, it resulted in the fund missing out on some arbitrage opportunities on the day the bitcoins were lost.
Lee will speak about the attack at Wednesday night’s Bitcoin Melbourne meetup event.

Correct, Tax determinations don't go through parliament. They're a determination by the commissioner, based on the the available legislation and the interpretation of terms like "payment, money &amp; currency".
However changes to the legislation that the determinations are based on ***do*** go through parliament, and this is where the MPs can help.
