Aren't a lot of people planning to sell once it hits 1K? Then wouldn't that send the prices down or would it only be temporary?

I agree. I think that with the price of bitcoin being so high right now some people who are looking to buy see the price and are intimidated, not knowing that it is possible to buy in smaller increments.

Interesting bit of writing, He really went after Ron and shamir's research. I wonder if he has received any flak from the government about the silk road accusations?

If we all do a good job using or donating some bitcoins friday then maybe cnnmoney.com or another news source will do a follow up story!

I like this idea but that puts a lot of responsibility on the kid to use the bitcoins responsibly instead of gambling them away in online casinos. Also I feel that the parents would need to be involved in some way because of how expensive bitcoins are now.

Nice! Another country getting on board with bitcoin. This just goes to show how easy it is to use and how it can be used from anywhere. I just hope that they stick with it and it is not just a 'flash in the pan' type of a thing.

you figured out the secret

I'm with bitcoin but like in any situation I feel as if the cream will rise to the top. Whatever the best cryptocurrency  out there is (bitcoin or other), I think that it will be a big part of our future.
