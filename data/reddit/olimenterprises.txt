Except it is generating legitimate addresses, look at the code. The only thing it is doing is a log. 
I agree others can fuck the RNG but this one isn’t.

Shouldn’t matter too much if your generating your addresses correctly in an offline medium on a temporary operating system with no internet access. 
Reported anyway, I’m sure some people have messed up and given their keys away :/

His article is speculative at best. Currently no one has a good measure of quantifying decentralisation, and how much "decentralisation" is enough. (what we are really concerned with is distribution, the bitcoin network is "decentralised" with only 2 full nodes using the standard definition; but we'll ignore this). 
How many full nodes do we need? 10k? (current amount)? is that enough or do we need 100k? Is 5k too few?
To be honest, what matters is where the nodes are. Once we have numerous nodes in every legal jurisdiction with enough for some redundancy, controlled by different people the network is arguably distributed enough. There is no benefit to adding anymore past this 'critical mass' (except we don't know when we reach the perfect number, I can tell you its not 100k though). 
To go deeper, listening nodes don't actually do shit on their own if they are just listening. They don't have a vote, only those with hashpower have a vote. So they don't actually secure the network in anyway. Their use is for those who actually have a reason to store the whole blockchain and listen to all transactions on the network (i.e. a merchant). There is literally no benefit for your average joe to use one to listen (or even to send transactions! SPV does that with the same security!). In fact, it has been proven that too many nodes actually slow down block propagation, thus worsening the strength of the network. 
I'd love to get a debate going on, always want my current views challenged.

Fees less than 1 sat/byte are possible very easily, with little coding required.

Looking at you, the core devs themselves ��. The “reference client” doesn’t even support segwit; should we all boycott bitcoin core then?!?
