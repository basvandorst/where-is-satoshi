Others were helpful and I now have answers.
\* As an edit, though, I'm willing to learn what assumptions I was making. For myself, and the benefit of future readers, what are the assumptions in my post, and what is wrong with them?
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:37:03
Ah, Excellent. I'll give this a watch. Cheers.

Alright, this was really helpful, a mega condensed version of the various bits I need to look at.
I suspect there is some pretty serious reading ahead.
Thanks for this :)

Ok, see, a Dorian is a minor scale with a natural sixth.

Even then, the site would likely require users to log in, even if just to allow the exchange of email addresses or even just messages.
At this point, the password that is used to authenticate your login is vulnerable.
Ok, nothing of value is intrinsically lost at this point, but access to someone's account could be used to gain access to sellers whose trust they hadn't earned, potentially phishing other users for email addresses or other info.

I'm seeing a ChangeTip bot in the YouTube comments.
This is a new one for me. How does this work? Is this a Google thing? Some automated account?
This is weird. And awesome.
@_date: 2014-01-10 12:47:32
Wow, more than helpful!
I'd never thought of the offline computer system. I guess equally useful in this respect might be a SIM-free handset or tablet with WiFi disabled.
Learning every day. Thanks for the response.

For the first time ever, I've seen PayPal adverts in the UK.
I make a habit of avoiding ads so maybe they have before but this is the first time I've seen them.

This is the weird concept to get used to with Bitcoin. Nobody actually *owns* anything.
It's about what you control more than what you have. Bitcoin is just a mechanism, but if you have control over an address/key pair, then you are able to send coins from that address, or "spend" them.
This was the lightbulb moment for me. There are no Bitcoins, there are just addresses with values, which we call Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-10 08:50:12
As fewer and fewer coins are left to mine, though, wouldn't the 51% problem, along with the potential for double spending, eventually become less and less feasible?
Is the 51% problem exclusively a mining problem? Strictly speaking, could the 51% problem exist once all coins had been successfully mined?
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:00:39
I'm still a relative noob but I had two perfectly good experiences with localbitcoins, although I've not invested very much.
As a buyer, bank transfer was the way for myself, but find out beforehand if you can whether the seller requires your name. This was the only slight sticking point with one of my purchases but even then the site allowed easy and clear communication with the seller. We clarified the issue quite quickly and the transfer itself was without any problems.
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:09:28
Heh, ok, this is the moment I realise I'm getting out of my depth..!
I'll have to do some more digging. I'm interested in the so-called 51% attack and how feasible it is and how disruptive it might be.
@_date: 2014-01-10 12:49:36
Well, this is something else that has worried me.
At the moment, I don't really have a lot in the way of BTC but obviously there will be those out there with thousands, tens of thousands, even more, in this currency. Not sure I'd trust that amount of investment to an app.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:31:08
Thanks for the info on change. I'd heard about transaction inputs and outputs and change but this has cleared up the specifics.
@_date: 2014-01-02 10:55:37
This would be impressive. My brain is now wondering how such a thing would be possible.

Oh, wow. I knew reddit had a tipbot or something like it, but I never realised that changetip worked across platforms like that. I'd already connected my YouTube account. Thank you, kind internet stranger! It seems as if changetip are carrying on where the likes of flattr faltered.
This is brilliant.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:23:08
Well, I'm pleased to find that my somewhat shaky deductive process hasn't led me from the truth!
I don't have a lot invested and I'm still, as many seem to be, unsure of exactly where this is all headed, but I'm liking what I'm reading about it and I'm pleased that I seem to be picking my way through the process reasonably well so far.
@_date: 2014-01-08 13:07:25
I've been looking at paper backups but I'm not sure how these work. Is it basically removing all online access to your address/private keys and storing these in a paper form which is easy to add back to a future online wallet?
I don't have that much BTC at the moment but I am a bit worried about the security of apps which have these details. To an unscrupulous developer I'm sure many tens of thousands of dollars, likely a lot more, would look tempting.
Paper wallets seem to be a way to mitigate this security risk. Is this correct?
@_date: 2014-01-15 10:21:30
Unable to ascertain … the address of dogecoin?!
That's one of the stupidest, funniest, and then stupidest all over again things I've read.
I thought it was common knowledge that dogecoin is administered from 1 Dogeway, Dogesville, Arizona?
How dumb do you have to be, West et al?
\* So, they're looking for a user, dogecoin, not the protocol, dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-01-15 10:26:56
Hmm. Ok. But the top level comment I left a moment ago shall stand.
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:51:01
Just linked my account.
I can feel myself retiring already!
I like where this is going, though. With the current model literally falling to pieces, copyright getting ridiculous, and streaming the way forward, I think tipping someone 20p for a listen might catch on. It's never going to be enough to make music a full time job, but pocket money can always be reinvested.
Plus it keeps the Bitcoin market active.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:27:20


In the near future, probably for the better, I would argue. It would be unfortunate for a bunch of ignorant scaremongerers to be the greater public's first contact with BTC!
@_date: 2014-09-03 09:18:38
This could be removed through the fingerprinting technology GooTube already uses to identify copyrighted material.
There's nothing stopping an uploader having a link to their website where fans may find a BTC address, though.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:19:19


I use a Bitcoin app which does this. The app doesn't give access to the unencrypted private keys and requires a password to export and re-import them.
I like this idea but that the app doesn't give me access to the unencrypted private keys simply raised my awareness of the app's (necessary) access to such a vital piece of information.
Thanks for taking the time. This is all food for thought.

Yeah, I know. I was looking at it and thinking in parts that it kinda looks like he's riding a motorcycle. That leaning in, gripping on for grim death…
Of course, this looks *WAY* more powerful than any motorbike I've ever ridden, and would therefore be *WAY* more fun.

Ah, got it. Thanks for the clear explanation.

Disclaimer: I'm a n00b about some of the technical aspects of bitcoin.
* Where is the blockchain stored? Is it distributed across many computers?
* Does each of those computers have to store the entire 15GB (and growing) blockchain?
* At what size does blockchain storage and/or propagation become an insurmountable barrier to the stability of bitcoin?

Paper isn't money, either.
Paper represents a *promise*, by the issuing authority.
Bitcoin is a promise that doesn't require paper.

If I leave my front door open, and someone steals my TV, they're the criminal.
It's not my fault the TV was stolen. I don't deserve punishment if someone else steals my TV.
The fault lies with the person doing the stealing.
Don't get me wrong, I may learn an important lesson after something like this. I may reassess the responsibilities to my property. I may change my behaviour. But none of this means that *I* stole my TV.
The person who took it is the person to blame. A jury sitting in a court of law serving a reasonable justice system would find the same thing.

See, I think this is a great way to defeat the ads. YouTube is a great content hub but I'm happy to pay for a *good* service that provides an easier, ad-free experience. If this is the way forward, and I think it certainly can be, we might be able to bypass the ad-supported model completely through direct support.
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:39:02
It is my supreme hope that services, protocols and concepts like Bitcoin, Flattr, Centup and other forms of near-instant and trivially easy payment systems will lead to a kind of Digital Reniassance.
This might be immensely naïve of me but evidence at the moment seems to be on my side.
You can even bitcoin redditors for their comments. It's legitimately a really exciting time for us internet folks.
Bring it. Let's cut out the sticky fingered middlemen and create a fucking awesome future.
