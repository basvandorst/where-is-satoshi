1) even LN will not serve the needs and demand of all global tx 
2) the cc fees are real.  Don’t you think second layer processors will charge fees on BTC.  And BTC requires huge electricity inputs, gotta pay for that too. 
3) BTC works where cc work, gotta have Internet and electricity and smart phones.   Nobodies logging into binance in the desert to check their balance 
Cryptos will win in the long run but right now credit cards give airline miles, hotel points, and big bucks to corporate accounts.

For how many years?  Calculate the anticipated amount of money you need to spend on coffee.  Then divide that number by 12k.

@_date: 2018-01-08 01:08:47
Flip that statement- it isn’t FUD to say we bought bitcoin when it was cheap, spendable, and there was no competition, and it used GPU’s for mining.  People today are looking at bitcoin as expensive, high fees, slow speeds, concentrated mining, and uses an insane amount of electricity to keep it running (POW).  
Honestly I’m still holding some BTC but how can you convince somebody with new money or old money that this is the best system for creating a digital currency.  Wait for LN?  Who waits for technology?  Also, many alts have a completely different function than BTC and aren’t even trying to be a currency.  There’s no shame in investing in crypto when you know crypto is going to grow as an industry.

Sign up at coinbase, Gemini, kraken, bitstamp, binance and just get in line to sign up and get verified.  Once you’re in buy some ether and litecoin so you can send it to other places that don’t take USD.  Buy BTC if you want to hold but too expensive to trade. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:05:01
It won’t much, but it dries up a source of fake money creation used to move money around from exchange to exchange.  People holding tethers were holding a hot potato, eventually the music will stop and somebody will be burned, but not BTC holders directly, unless they panic and some will.

Uuuugh, I Agree with others here, this isn’t a scam.  Some better sites allow you to pay the fee in the coin you are trading, so you lose some dust but don’t see it.  
Just Buy the binance coin as a registration fee and you save 50% immediately.   Also the binance coin can increase in value itself as more people use binance.  
I am sick and tired of these fucking noobs calling everything a SCAM, binance, kraken, bitfinex.  There is a difference between a scam, pyramid schemes and companies that are just making a profit from their business.

You aren’t understanding currency correctly.  Essentially we already have gold and oil as world currencies because every country needs them and wants them.  Poorer countries don’t decrease your Gold, they just have less of it than Americans, their goods and services therefore cost less in their countries.  
If bitcoin were the only money starting tomorrow, your relative wealth wouldn’t change...the average American would earn 3-4 bitcoins per year and a decent car would cost 2.5 bitcoins.  But in Venezuela the have a lower GDP and standard of living so they only earn 1 bitcoin per year and a car costs 0.5 bitcoins for example

Exactly, a slower economy drags down stocks of airlines, hotels and vacation properties before it takes down Coca Cola and McDonald’s.  Some consolidation is overdue??? Dogecoin has doubled in value in 2018!?!?
The overall crypto market has gained 500billion in a few months.  Are we going to see profit taking or has the pump only begun?  It also depends if any crypto can get to the point that everyday people can actually use it at the grocery store.  And don’t even respond with some stuff about Bitcoin and LN.  My mom isn’t going to sign up at Gdax to get BTC to load her channel so she can go to the grocery store when credit cards have already solved this problem for that generation.

Most accurate post EVER!  
It was inevitable though, creating wealth outside of the regulations was awesome until the big money figured out how to drain as much profit from the system while making zero effort to create an actual ecosystem.  They added more coins to buy without actually creating more reasons to use them.  Some coins will thrive but mostly the centralized coins that build niche products for corporations.

I’m not sure alts will crash, of course some will but many are here to stay.  Some are niche players, some have cheaper mining, most have faster transactions (currently), many have actual value.  Binance coins are an interesting example.  As every other exchange is facing delays, regulations and all forms of problems for noobs, binance is a great way to find other cryptos.  The binance coin (bnb) can be purchased and gives you lower transaction fees..,so you get a 50% gain on bnb just by using it.  The increasing traffic at binance also increases the demand and price of their coins?!!   Bnb will never replace BTC but it isn’t trying to and it doesn’t have to.  It is just 1 example of a coin that serves a small intended purpose and gives immediate gains for users (unlike HODL coins).   
Full disclosure- I use shapeshift and binance to diversify and hold some alt cryptos.

I didn’t intend to slam Robinhood directly, I know several people who use them for stocks but Robinhood will need different expertise, different security and crypto engineers and that costs money.  My comment was more geared at people who think something can be free.  In the same way that credit cards, email and Facebook are free to the user but they have revenue streams elsewhere.  
I’m guessing they make money on the cash balances in accounts but that isn’t much and it implies they will need other revenue streams once they get past the startup stage and they need to expand and increase their bandwidth?  Perhaps they offer leverage and other advanced trading features that require cash deposits and bring in extra money?

BUT a group of whales with BTC could take short positions, sell their BTC at a high price, cause panic selling, win on their futures bets and buy BTC back at a lower price.  Double win if executed properly, double losses if they don’t.  The price of BTC already moves 10-15% in any given day so coordinated whales could take this risk and dump at a good time planning to buy back after a 20% correction below 10k.

True, the Santa Claus rally is real.  But we’re still 2 weeks out.  BTC could be 10k or 30k.  There could also be a mini rally on Jan 1 when coinbase releases BCH, many people will take that money straight to BTC.  It’s like a free investment for lots of people.

Investments are taxed separate from income if held long term and usually at 15%.  You buy a stock or BTC and you sell it 2 years later and earn $1000 profit you owe $150 in taxes.   You only pay taxes when you sell and only pay taxes on the profit.  Doesn’t touch your day job.

For bitcoin to become mainstream it needs additional work and bandwidth, essentially the lightning network turning it into a glorified credit card network.  The Govt will tame it, regulate it and tax it to make their money.  If it stays small it can avoid government regs but then it can’t take over the role of fiat.  Catch 22.  
Just look at stocks.  An individual is buying ownership of a company on their own free will with their own money.  No need for the govt to get involved right?  Nope, They regulate every godamned aspect of investing in or owning or running a publicly held company.  So shall it be with bitcoin if you want to use it at the grocery store someday.

Truth.  Although they were really trying to fix the books to thrill the investors.  And Wells Fargo too, they were inflating their numbers to keep the stock growing which is very different from just closing and stealing account money and just walking away.

It’s been fine for me today?  I intrepret it as noobs were pushing coinbase prices up with their small buys but they are HODL.  Investors are using kraken to dump BTC at lower fees rather than mess with coinbase.  BTC is bleeding out and kraken has the most alt pairings for US customers.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:48:26
TLDR.  I skimmed your post but I have 1 comment from my experience....bitcoin gives no shits about media FUD.  In fact, every time Paul Krugman and Jaime dimon open their mouths I buy more and BTC goes up within days.  It is not reasonable that a journalist could affect prices with an article.  It is reasonable though that whales could be playing both sides of the futures/BTC contracts as they see fit.  
Also, the SEC didn’t catch Bernie madoff for a decade when he was right in front of them and they approved all of the vehicles such as mortgage backed securities and derivatives that led the world into a recession...heads up their asses.

The winner hasn’t been created yet.

How many people have money in Korean and US exchanges and can move enough money to make the fees and delays worthwhile...not very many but I’m sure somebody does and already did.  
More likely you would use litecoin to move funds without banks and trade alts at best sites.  This is why many alts move exactly in tandem with BTC while the cash price can vary between currencies.

Yes, but we are the villagers buying up the monkeys cheap and selling them to the villagers down the road for a profit.  The people who got here in December are buying overpriced monkeys.  At least I hope! 
But seriously, very good fable and everybody should think about this.  1) nobody asks why the monkeys are worth money. If there was value in monkeys they could sell them without the middleman.  Very much like bitcoin now.  Nobody knows how or when the monkeys will have real world value (lightning).  2) what makes the monkeys go from $100 to $700.  If nothing has changed then why would bitcoin be worth $16k more today compared to July, FOMO and speculation.  People realized they missed the $100 monkeys but don’t want to miss the $1000 monkeys but they are absolutely certain they can sell their $100 monkeys for lambos someday!!

If you have another account (gdax, Gemini) buy yourself some BTC or ether and send it to kraken.  Convert BTC to ether or ether to BTC so you have enough to send.  Send the BTC or ether back to primary account.  You’re gonna pay fees so just leave it there for 3 years until it is worth 10k but don’t forget.

Your pyramid analogy is still completely incorrect.  A business is a pyramid by design.  You only need 1 boss and many workers.  The workers get paid less and can’t take the bosses job.  Bitcoin, everybody has the same value for the amount bitcoin they have, there is no boss, everyone could have 1 bitcoin.  You are just assuming it is a pyramid because some people got here first.  I can buy 10 bitcoins tomorrow and nobody can stop me, I can’t become an executive at my company tomorrow. Again your analogy is super weak.  Bitcoin works like stocks, some people have more, some people have less due to reality but not because it is intentionally designed that way.

Do you even realize how hypocritical your own statements are???
Also, money creation by central govt is not something you seem to understand.  Legit Governments issue bonds and treasury notes that bear interest to the lenders, it is money creation at known interest rates and leads to some inflation.  The interest payments create money that never existed but is owed by the govt and paid to the lender so it becomes very real as just 1 example of govt money creation.

2) futures started a week ago, this is just a new company selling them

4) bitcoin is up a million percent, so it can go down 50% and still be the best asset of 2017.

Yes, everyone knows there is a trillion dollar economy of drugs, sex, illicit, and more drugs.  But regarding the 11k price of BTC.

Never use PayPal.  They are not licensed.  Try Gemini and bitstamp.  Might be faster than coinbase but you are not going to buy BTC today.

It was the fact that you have a digital currency with 2000% growth and a $40 fee for every single transaction so essentially useless credits.  Bitcoin was not ready to scale and proved itself vulnerable.  End of story.

No, because everybody else is mining while you’re out and getting s bigger cuts of BTC.  Then you come back and the difficulty is the same for everyone so you’re still only earning the same % of the pie.  Once you buy a miner....it needs to be running 24/7/365 or you are not earning.  Turning off only helps the competition.

Join coinbase or Gemini....it will take 2 weeks to get all verified and shit but after that it’s smooth sailing.  Write down your login and passwords on paper and hide it safely.  Deposit money from your bank....when you buy your bitcoin or litecoin it will stay with coinbase and Gemini and they will hold it for you.  You can move it to your own wallet if you are comfortable (mycelium or bread wallet).  Then you can pay for shit online semi-anonymous.  
Localbitcoins and all the rest are riskier and not licensed but if you’re buying drugs you probably don’t care anyway.

Futures traders settle in cash, they aren’t buying coins and they aren’t paying those fees.  Traders of bitcoin won’t continue to pay these fees, it eats their profits.  Everyday people can’t pay $40 miner fees to buy and use bitcoin?  
So you can HODL until lightning comes, wait out the growing pains.  Or you can sell and find investments that you feel have more utility and immediate advantages here and now.  No emotion, just a choice.

Of course that is not realistic. The truth is somewhere in between but not every bitcoin needs to be bought for 1 million for price to reach 1 million.  If only a small number of coins are liquid (due to HODL) then the price of all 21 mil bitcoins is the  sell price of only the available coins, Got it?!?

Sorry for being snappy, it’s just that bitcoin doesn’t meet any of the definitions of a true ponzi.  People use the term ponzi too vaguely.  They say ponzi 
when they really mean bubble or overvalued.  
BTC hasn’t found its final form yet but it is therefore hard to define value.  It has one value for people who want to buy illegal things.  It has another value for people looking to avoid fiat inflation.  It could have increased value if more businesses accept it.  It has value to international travelers and international transactions.  It has value to migrant workers who want to send payments over borders without fees.  So it is hard to quantitate but BTC has REAL value in the small advantages it currently offers.

No and it’s more like buying a stock.  Sign up at coinbase or Gemini, it is very easy and you’ll be ready to go in 7-10 business days.  They take care of the crypto and security stuff while you read and learn more about wallets.  You pay them and they hold your bitcoin safely just like a bank holds your cash or a broker holds the records of your stocks.

Individual fiats can and do crash.  Usually in third world countries though.  They form a new government and issue new dollars and reset the clock on their money.  Large industrial nations keep inflation in check and have large GDP and gold reserves to indirectly support their money.  And when they run out of money they sell debt (bonds) and lower interest rates to increase purchasing power in the short term.

That’s barely a percentage difference.  New money comes in to coinbase first, those are noobs.  Then move their money to other exchanges over time.  Cheaper to buy on gdax so you get better deal.

Retail investors tend to set their trades and sell prices at big even numbers.  For example:  wow, if it ever reaches 10k I’m selling!!  So lots of sell orders stack up at exactly 10k.  Then the trade bots see the wall and set their sell prices at $9991 so they get paid first.  Happens in any stock due to human nature and our stupidity.  We think that 10,005 is somehow much better than 9983 when there is barely any difference.  Hence it is a “Psychological barrier” and not s technical barrier.  Technical barriers are based on statistics, MACD, moving averages, RSI, etc

Those are industry terms...its called the adoption cycle and it is well established terms that match the emotional hype and deflation of “new” and disruptive investments.  I came to reddit to learn about crypto and I did and I’m greatful for what I’ve learned.  Ive held crypto since 2013 and held through the rough times.  I’ve also helped dozens of noobs with questions about wallets and exchanges and basic questions.  Now I’m trying to share some advice for those who aren’t well informed about investing and are surprised when bitcoin is dropping after a 2000% gain and $50 transaction fees that still take 2 hours.  
You can ignore me and call me a Fudster, most people do.  But I’m out there every day scanning the horizon, answering questions and looking at the competition.  I got into BTC relatively early, I moved into eth below $20, I got into xrp early,  litecoin below $60, xmr below $100.  Iota, cardano, omnisego will be the next wave people haven’t used yet.  Unfortunately, It’s not about technology, it’s about the herd chasing the next shiny coin that they think is new.

The number you are seeing is coming from a top Korean exchange.  This is mostly a US website so most of our money is on US exchanges or USD.

Technology, wallets, and payment services will improve over the next ten years for both crypto and fiat.  So for that reason you want a coin with large global appeal but also speed and adaptability would be important.  
Also machine to machine communication will go exponential in the next ten years and machine to business transactions will go exponential so finding a platform that is targeting that opportunity.

Do you understand how any investments work...stocks, bonds, houses?!?  Somebody else bought the stocks and they only become more valuable if somebody else wants to buy those stocks.    The person who buys stock in an early Google makes a profit when he sells it today.  Bitcoin is EXACTLY 
Secondly, your pyramid analogy is completely incorrect for many reasons.  1) if I sell my bitcoins to you I am out of the pyramid now, I don’t move up the pyramid.  Pyramid schemes keep 1 group on top.  Not bitcoin or stocks or gold.  You sell and you’re now back at the bottom.  2) everyone in the world can buy bitcoins at the same price right now.  There is no insider discount.  You buy a stock or gold or bitcoin at the same price as everybody else. 3) you aren’t joining any club and you aren’t paying fees.  You buy a bitcoin from the exchange just like you buy stocks from the exchange.  They have a license and regulatory approval.  The fee is for the maintenance and convenience, not an annual membership.  
It’s good to be skeptical but hopefully you will learn the true aspects of pyramid, ponzi, shopping clubs, and freely traded assets.

They are lying to you, but you can’t prove it, but they also can’t prove that a transaction did happen unless they produce emails, bank accounts, exchange records etc.   and even if they show a TX ID it could just be the right hand transferring to the left hand.

The discussion is not the economics of mining, it was the moral neutrality of using BTC over govt controlled fiat.  
And the reality (IMHO) is that the same type of assholes that control fiat may very well be the same type of assholes that use BTC and profit and run crypto mining and exchanges in the future.  Because there is a barrier to entry to keep the average person out....millions of dollars in ASICS and warehouses in low cost parts of the world isn’t exactly free entry.  It will become consolidated and profitable for the few....

If you were looking for an exit, it was January, if you’re holding you’re still fine, if you want to buy I’d be very cautious as we’re still bumping downward,

It wouldn’t grow with a deflationary currency and that’s why none has ever existed but don’t worry because BTC will not take over the entire financial world.  It’s so fucking slow that it can’t even transact at minuscule adoption and it will need tons of payment layers on top that will charge fees just like the miners.  So as price and adoption rise then the fees increase rapidly so bitcoin becomes more impossible to use and adoption will decrease until people move on.

Ok I’ll elaborate since you don’t seem to understand bitcoin prices or mining.  
The cost of mining a bitcoin isn’t fixed.  Depends on your rig and electricity costs....so the cost of mining a bitcoin varies for each person.  
The spot price of bitcoin also varies wildly and is dependent on demand from buyers at exchanges and elsewhere.  
As a clear example, the price of bitcoin has risen and fallen dramatically while the average cost of mining is probably rising due to competition so the cost of a bitcoin is NOT the mining cost.

I’ve always viewed it like oil production.  Market demand drives the incentive to either increase or decrease production.  When consumption is high and prices are high OPEC opens production.  When bitcoin is up even the shitty equipment can make a buck.  When prices are down, you decrease the interest and kill the weakest producers?  
So you’re probably correct in that the price of mining equilibrates to a tolerable price near profitability but never too far above it.  When mining is profitable everybody jumps in until it isn’t profitable for the little guys anymore.   There may also be those who think bitcoin will be 100K so they’ll mine at a loss no matter what....who fucking knows....uncharted territory.

Payments: barter, trade, seashells, coins, fiat, paper money, checks, credit cards, Apple Pay, digital coins.

Most of these kids don’t have $1000 to invest in 2 things at the same time.  They hate banks (fake anger) and they grew up in the mortgage crisis.  I don’t think many people would sell their funds and 401k into all bitcoin but it was a good place to put a few percent of your money.  
If you have a diversified classic stock, bond, fund portfolio, I’d buy some crypto every month just like buying any riskier asset after you’re established.  I’m selling down bitcoin because I’ve already profited and I don’t think 2018 is going very well but I’m certainly ready to buy back 10k-20k if things improve.

No.  Hash rate is the amount of computing power applied towards the network.  Price is what buyers and sellers are willing to pay for a piece of BTC.  
They are not correlated but somewhat causative.  If the price goes up it is more profitable to mine so more people do it.  If the price drops then it is less profitable and some miners might quit.  Hashrate has been growing exponentially as better ASICS flood the market even though bitcoins price continues to bubble-pop and repeat.

The strength of a currency is mostly the relative value against its peers.  The weakest 10 countries on earth lose value against their neighbors and downward spiral.  
The largest economies and currencies can only teeter-totter against each other.  A drop in EU becomes a gain in USD and Yen and vice versa.  They can’t all collapse at once because they are pegged to each other.  As one major currency gets cheaper they can export more and they gain.  As another country gains they can import more from others and drive revenue.  
Everybody needs food, oil, tech, commerce etc.  the top 10 currencies are safe and the lowest 10 will always fail.  The US has never defaulted in 200 years including a civil war, 2 WW, several depressions, etc.  So....maybe the West is exactly as strong as people think!!!   ��

Most online retailers give you a spot price and you have 15 minutes to complete the transaction and get the confirmations.  
On any exchange the price will change by the second.  Unless you are buying 10k these small fluctuations shouldn’t be that significant.

Some reasons why anybody buys a negative bond rate: let’s say inflation is 3% but rates are anything below 3%
1) If you think stocks are gonna tank then losing a few percent is the lesser risk.
2) a foreign country may still want US bonds as the safest bet against their own currency. 
3) many bond funds are passive and constantly buy the next bond after maturation regardless of the rate.  
4) banks only insure cash to a limit, a bond, CD or other instruments gives extra insurance.  
5) cash loses at the rate of inflation.  A money market account paying 0.1% is still 0.1% better.

Are you referring to quantitative easing or just in general?  Generally speaking it is lending money at interest rates that are below inflation rates....so it isn’t always a negative integer but just a guaranteed loss to the bond buyer.  Or in some cases 1 govt entity (Fed) is buying bonds from another (treasury) to move money from 1 pocket to another to create artificial demand and keep interest rates super low.

Well yes, the USA was doing pretty well in the decades after Europe and Asia were decimated by 6 years of war and all of their factories were bombed to ashes.  We had the best infrastructure for exporting and the best baby boom for spending money.  Income and Wages increased faster than the cost of goods sold until serious inflation slowed us down in the 70s and foreign competition for manufacturing, technology and workers caught up.  This is only a predictable and natural progression that anyone can understand.  
think about it:  why would the wages in just 1 country continue to grow above the cost of goods manufactured in a global economy.  If 1 country has tons of money....they’ll just buy everything until manufacturing prices rise or wages are relatively lowered by competition.   I’m sorry to break it to you that 2-3% inflation is not the end of America, it’s a healthy equilibrium in a global economy.

Blockchain is an enabling technology like computing or the internet, you profit off of the companies that capitalize on the technology, or capitalize on the hardware/software.  It’s your job to decide if you see opportunities in this space.  
Amazon = shopping + internet.  
Netflix = TV + internet.  
Intel = hardware to improve the machines.  
Google = software to add utility to  the machines.   
Blockchain = accounting + distributed ledger+ data security.  
Cryptocurrencies = money + blockchains + privacy + speed.

None, but online gambling isn’t legal in the US.

What a pile of FUD crap, irrelevant numbers and twisted extrapolations.  If this article is really from Forbes I am disappointed, this is more the sad standards of the Federalist.  
1) The federal debt is currently equal to GDP and that ratio has been steady for ten years
2) the federal debt is funded by treasury notes at low yields and spread over time.  Showing the amount per taxpayer is a scare tactic.  
3) if your family earned 100k per year without any credit card debt and you only owed 100k on your house at 3-4% interest over 15 years you’d be pretty happy.  That’s our govt right now, the economy is growing in line but we’ve added debt accrued from the Middle East wars and mortgage meltdown.  Not great but not catastrophic either.  
4) the people who rate debt and assign investment grades still think the USA is top tier.

Well thank you for being more reasonable than elwar.  Now think it through a few steps further.

Who will build all the new ASICS to support the coin revolution?  Who will build and maintain the next generation of wallets with backup protections that are so easy your grandma can use them?  Who will build the servers to store this insane amount of data and the legal teams to establish coin Inheritance and transfer on death contracts.  
I’m sure you’re screaming in your head about how wrong I am and delfin is gonna say something about how BTC can’t be controlled.....but I have evidence.  Alcohol used to be an underground empire but govt tamed and taxed it.  Gambling used to be a mafia cash cow but now the corporations run it.  Pot used to be the symbol of the counter-culture but again the govt regulated and taxed it.  Crypto will always have its unregulated side but mass adoption means corporations and govt involvement.

In your example:  The US needs money, the US doesn’t have $1000.  China gives the US $1000 and we give them a bond note at a set interest rate.  We slowly pay them back their money plus interest in the years to come.  Jesus Christ how is it that hard to understand???

Not technical vulnerabilities.  Going on 10 years of perfect service.  
The vulnerability is that BTC is slow and has limited transactions per second.  POW is time consuming and the blockchain can get congested and expensive due to spam attacks or any high volume.  Secondary solutions are needed to take some of those BTC transactions off the blockchain.

Bad in short term, better in long term.  
Bad because it will steal VC funding and programmers away from crypto and move to the guaranteed profits of online gambling sites.  Bad because it is a new revenue stream for credit cards and payment processors and they won’t be using crypto at first.  Bad because it will drain money from gamblers and redirect investments from the rich to a more lucrative and guaranteed field.

Ok, but I’d say that’s more a comparison to  blockchain than bitcoin.  Blockchains are the enabling technology but the crypto coins are just a million different applications of blockchain.  Bitcoin is one product that runs on a blockchain and blockchains need the Internet and the internet needs computers and computers still use 1 and 0.  So bitcoin isn’t the pinnacle of technology, it’s just 1 example of what’s possible.  
Furthermore, I’m here for the profit, and the profit is in the utility and application of blockchains, not the formulas.  I don’t directly profit from the internet protocols and TCPIP, I profit from Amazon using the internet to sell shit!!!

Anybody who thinks deflationary currencies would be preferable to inflationary are just dreaming.

I guess I’d be inclined to hear your thoughts on the issue if you could provide a concrete example of a deflationary national currency.

Every period of deflation in modern history was associated with an economic slowdown and hardship.

1) you probably can’t prove who owns the email.  Even if you did they could say it was hacked. 
2) you still can’t prove who owns the BTC address. It could be somebody else’s.  
3) they’ve already moved your BTC.  
4) there are no crypto address police.  That’s the point.  
5) an email is rarely a solid legal contract.             6) you probably don’t want the police or courts looking at why you are selling 10k with strangers.  The victim is probably breaking some anti-laundering laws to begin with.

I half agree. Of course if the US govt is wiped out it will be bad for EVERYBODY including bitcoin.  If a solar flare destroys satellites and ground communication it will be bad for everybody and bitcoin.  
But you are not understanding the backing of the USD correctly.  The people elected are just people, the ability to pay off debt comes from the ability to raise taxes on the enormous US economy and GDP.  Several countries have gone into complete collapse and govt changes ( see Germany) and come out clean because a new govt can take over and start taxing that economy again and pay off debts.  Trump doesn’t back the USD, our ability to grow the worlds grain supply and buy their oil will keep the wheel turning.

Because they’ve invested millions in equipment and facilities and even the suspicion of a double spend would plummet the price of BTC so they’d render their investment obsolete.  They’d have to get in, steal more than they can get by mining and cash out before anybody gets wise

Correct, we already know bitcoin can’t be a global currency because it is too slow.

I was not referring to valuation, only to the ownership of bitcoin.  But also, It is traded and owned exactly like a fucking stock.  Everybody can buy it or sell it and everybody pays the same price.  There is no pyramid of management as referred to by the OP, only open exchange by free will.  
Stocks are valued based on many things.  It is mostly fundamentals with a bit of speculation/expectations.     The PE ratio is greater than 1 because of the potential growth that investors predict.  The price of bitcoin is the opposite 90% speculation and only 10% fundamentals.  This is very similar to biotech or startups that have negative revenue but have the POTENTIAL for a blockbuster drug.  You can invest in thousands of companies on the nasdaq that have no earnings, only potential earnings in the future.  So bitcoin is not like buying blue chip stocks, but it is exactly like buying penny stocks hoping that the future utility will meet the current hype.

A Ponzi scheme is where you pay the first person in with the proceeds from the last person.  That can’t happen with bitcoin in general except at a single corrupt exchange.

You can have a million addresses.  It’s just up to you to remember the keys, passwords etc.  
Coinbase is a custodial wallet service like a bank.  Those addresses are controlled by coinbase and they reflect your balance.  You have to request coinbase to move your funds at their discretion.  Other wallets like Samurai or a ledger nano give you complete control of your addresses but if you fuck it up it’s gone.

What video?  Because I don’t think I would use that term in bitcoin.  Typically, power users is a business term for employees who are trained early or have extra expertise so that they can train the other employees around them.  
Example:  how do I schedule a meeting with our new skype business software?  Talk to Steve, he’s the power user in our office.  
Bitcoin has early adopters- people who by into a technology early before it is popular.  
We have whales- people who own a lot of bitcoin. 
We have miners who provide the computer hashing power to run the network. 
We have pools that are collections of miners working together.  
We have exchanges where people can buy or sell their bitcoin.  
We have developers and we have people who help build software for storing bitcoin.  
I don’t know anybody I would call a power user in the sense that I can’t call them up and have them come install some bitcoin wallet.

Whales are big movers, heavy hitters.  The term comes from gambling 
But how they apply to crypto is easy - It’s god creation-  people who want to understand why the price is dropping need an easy explanation and scapegoat.  
Same psychology as people creating fire gods and cloud gods to explain the events around them.  Why is the volcano erupting - the mountain god must be angry.  Why is the BTC price dropping - it must be whales selling BTC to manipulate the price.

I think you need to abandon your belief that business 101 will protect your investment and start learning Reality 101 that the world doesn’t give a crap about your mining costs and crypto business models.  If nobody wants to buy it then the price will drop.  The miners can do whatever they want with their expensive ASICs but nobody on Wall Street or Main Street cares if Jihan Wu goes out of business.  They’ll pick up the scraps and they’ll start Amazon Bucks and Starbucks Cash and they won’t even blink.  Everybody here believes in crypto but only a fool would think that the price can’t drop to $3000 tomorrow.  That’s still a huge increase over 1 year.  If miners existed in early 2017 when the price was 7x lower......
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:42:50
That’s your assumption, it isn’t necessarily correct.  And a direct correlation of price and electricity is completely ridiculous.  The price can go down while the hashrate increases.  The price can go up while hashrate decreases.  New equipment can increase the hashrate per KwH irrelevant of price.  More people could hash cheaper alt coins at lower KWh and just buy BTC and raise the price with fewer machines.  
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:53:35
There is one major difference in all of this.  Phone and credit cards have centralized control and they can issue new cards and upgrades with minimal disruption to the customer... decentralized crypto requires consensus so how mad is somebody going to be if they have to keep up with upgrades that they don’t want or agree with or what happens when you can’t get to your money because you’re behind a fork??!

Holding a price with zero funding does not exist.  Your friend sending you bitcoin has nothing to do with it....Ignore that part for now.  
Put money on kraken.  You can buy or sell BTC on leverage meaning you buy or sell more than you have but you need some cash or value in hand or else why would the exchange take that risk.  You buy or sell at the current price and you decide when to close that contract.  If the price drops, you pay the difference, if the price improves you keep the difference.  Either way you must have money in the account and you will definitely pay fees for using such a service.  Clear?

Good analysis but a few observations.

It can be sell pressure or the lack of buying interest.  Volume is down, the FOMO is over.  New coins are minted everyday and nobody wants them, the price drops as miners try to pay their bills.  
I’ve been selling all year because I bought years ago and I’m not watching it go down the drain to 4K.  
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:14:31
Have you shopped with BTC?  The prices are quoted in a fixed fiat price and you click buy.  It then calculates the bitcoin price and you usually have 15min to complete the TXID at that price.  
The other way is silly.... charging a price of 0.00333btc and have it constantly changing is kinda weird and would not create a very customer friendly experience.  99.9999% of humanity still calculate costs in fiat and your costs as a business are denominated in fiat.  Good luck.

@_date: 2018-06-27 23:21:10
They don’t.  One thing was overvalued by 20k and that was not sustainable.  The other thing was a relatively tiny bit of money that went into futures in which you need both a buyer and taker.    Bitcoin killed itself when the TX fees were $30 and 30 minutes.  No currency of the future has a $30 fee on a $1 purchase.  Flawed currency.

No, the buyer adds to his price.  You charge $10.  They pay $10.05 to get it there.

If you didn’t see this coming you were blind.  Decentralized means you can’t file patents because there is no business entity.  Satoshi can’t create contracts.  
They can’t block bitcoin directly because it is already in the public sphere but they can create payment systems and functionality improvements that are patented and lead to business adoption and thereby render bitcoin outdated and risky for businesses to accept as payment.  They can make credit cards 2.0 and leverage their existing infrastructure.

For everyday people in first world countries buying legal items....there’s no incentive today.  Credit cards are fast, mindless and give you points and boosts your credit score.  Bitcoin actually costs money to use, creates a tax burden and can’t be used as credit or collateral in loans.  
Bitcoin is better for online, cross-border or illegal purchases requiring semi anonymity as of today.  The only incentive is the obvious speculation that better wallets and adoption are coming and that the price will rise for all users.

Bitcoin did not get regular coverage on mainstream news outlets and the SEC barely mentioned it until this bull run.  This was the first time stocks or futures were available to the general public.

Put aside your misplaced anger.   Think about this....the same people and exchanges and options existed during the 2017 bull run and the price still went up.  They’ve always been there.  The same people exist in stock markets and the values can still go up.  Finding scapegoats is rookie investing.  Don’t complain when the tides temporarily turn against you.

Nothing happens in a vacuum.  Germany was impoverished after WWI and could not pay reparations as they tried to rebuild.  They printed money to try to pay their debts.  Zimbabwe made many terrible decisions but it was probably a drought that pushed them over the edge from bad to downward spiral.  Almost every breakaway republic from the Soviet Union went through at least 1 govt change or war or no longer had the same economic power as their nearby European competitors.  Most Baltic states suffered in the short term.  
But mostly, war and paying for wars is 90% of the cause,  the govt money printing is usually an after-effect or the final error.

Ive also thought that any future society would use energy as a base unit of value along with units of raw materials required for farming/manufacturing.  The cost of food would be determined by the units of energy required to get it to your dinner table.  Simple, universal, standardized and can’t be manipulated by inflation.  BTC and energy share many parallels, both are under increasing demand but technology is also increasing the supply/efficiency.  One advantage to BTC, it can be transferred anywhere and energy can only be transferred so many thousand miles before it becomes cost inefficient.

All investment is speculation unless you are buying a loaf of bread and going to eat it for lunch.  Technology and digital payments are growing, BTC is digital payments.

Delfin- it’s amazing that you can be wrong everyday.  Middlemen (payment platforms) will always exist in legal commerce because humans can’t be trusted.  
That’s why we use eBay and craigslist and escrow services and payment platforms.  They mitigate the risk of doing business with unknown persons which is most legal businesses and almost all internet business.  
I’m not going to send you products until your payment is processed or I see that you are using a verified credit card.  Those protect the business from fraud and losses so it’s an acceptable cost.  
Yes bitcoin can be frictionless and peer to peer but Business owners aren’t awake at 3am to check incoming orders and can’t check their coinbase balance for every customer on a busy Saturday.  Imagine your doctor waiting for your bitcoin to confirm for every patient they see everyday.....hence payment processors handle millions of transactions so business owners can run their business.  Simple, inevitable, every currency

Again, I don’t use local bitcoins.  If you don’t know the person, there are multiple risks.  That’s why people offer a premium or discount, they are doing something illegal and keep yourself out of it whether you are A B or C.

Those technologies took over the world but NOBODY would ever say the internet is a bubble or overpriced.  Have you ever heard somebody say that worldwide cell phone usage is going to dip soon because they have gone up too fast.  Nope, BTC is a payment technology and it’s price is based on adoption, not sales revenues or profit margins

Humans are raping the rainforest and the arctic to dig up a yellow rock called gold that we mostly just put back underground in concrete rooms.

It’s a scam, why would they need your money.  BTC is up 700% in 6 months.  Again, if he already has the equipment why does he need you???  There are nothing but red flags dummy.  Once he has your money and the miners, why would he pay you back???  The only legit operations are those in which you use your equipment to mine and turn the hash power towards a collective group in which the hash is shared.  
Red flags, another country, bitcoin, promises, your money.

We already have so many negative events factored into the price and nobody cares.....Low adoption rates, mainstream resistance, bcash attacks, shitty service, high fees, 100 alt coins, slow exchanges, small ecosystem.

@_date: 2017-11-28 13:09:11
Dumb question...what are the fundamentals that it IS a bubble.  There aren’t any indicators, BTC isn’t a company, what is the analysis that says adoption is slowing down or speeding up?  It can’t be a bubble if there is no definition of bubble? Also...the bubble people have been wrong for a long long Time now

They are now like “stocks” and stocks are not considered a Ponzi scheme.  The price increases as they become more desired but not a ponzi because someone must agree to sell before somebody else can buy.   A ponzi survives by noobs paying fees to the “owners” but the owners never have to give anything up and are only pushed higher by new blood.  In stocks and coins, a noob can buy as many or as few and hold or sell, freedom of choice.  An early adopter makes a profit if he sells but then he moves back to the bottom and is no longer an owner.   Read up on true ponzi, many shopping “clubs” are Ponzi schemes.

You are 4 years late for the conspiracy theories.  Major banks and financial institutions are using it.  Bitcoin is very simple and open source, millions have looked at it, copied it, modified it and used it without some secret satoshi bug.  Crypto is now worth $250 billion dollars, so if the US wants to try to crash it they would need to inject some serious capital to purchase enough bitcoins first, then crash it later.  Dumb idea and besides most governments stand to gain money, their citizens and businesses around crypto are making capital gains.  Worry more about mining operations working against bitcoin for their own gains.

It’s exactly like stocks.  Your grandpa got them first and you have to pay more as they gain value.  But unlike a ponzi, when you sell your stock, you are out, you don’t stay at the top.

More buyers push the price up like any commodity.

If you believe in the utility of digital currency then you are not too late.  You aren’t the first but there are still 7 billion people who use money who don’t have any digital currency yet and another 7 billion plus people who will be born in the next 25 years into a digital world.  They will use electronic devices to make payments, not sure how exactly, but you’ve started in the best place possible in 2017 with the information available.

If you’ve never sold and only bought it should be easy.   Add up everything you’ve spent in USD and divide it by the number of BTC you have and that’s your cost basis.  EX: you Spent $3000 dollars to get 3 coins =$1000/ coin.   If you sell 1 coin today at $8500...that would be 1 coin at a gain of $7500 and you should pay taxes on $7500 at capital gains rate.  IRS can audit you for up to 7 years.,.pay taxes

A bunch of Wall Street smart asses are going to think their fancy bots will crush a bunch of college kid hodlers.  Unfortunately all those bots were perfected against the stock market in which liquidity is high and volatility is low.  On the flip side I would love to be a mining consortium, wait for all the Wall streeters to arrive and set up positions then literally turn off the hash rate and watch tx times and fees soar and watch them sink into panic as they realize there are no fucking rules to crypto trading.  Then turn up the hash rate, and scoop up their sells at cheaper price.  Basically repeat the bch attack on hash rate every 3 months to flush out the weak stomachs and over leveraged???

Yes, that’s more accurate.  But every stupid person uses the word bubble or ponzi without actually knowing the definition.

I think you have it backwards angry person.  Neutrality means that service providers CANNOT dictate what websites we see and CANT charge more for premium sites and can’t control the competition?  If neutrality is lost then service providers CAN charge extra for Netflix bandwidth or block sites that are considered competition.  This was not an issue 10 years ago when internet bandwidth was low for everybody and it was purely for entertainment/porn and not the integral business platform it has become.  In many parts of the country there are less than 3 quality service providers, that means they decide what the internet is in your area.  Let the market decide???

You can keep your bitcoins, you can trade them with anybody you like.  You can use them to purchase goods all by yourself.  You asked about exchanges that buy and sell and trade BTC.  That requires a license in the USA.  Got it? The upside is that fiat money is inflationary and loses value over time sitting in your account whereas bitcoin is limited and deflationary so it might go up in value while sitting in your Coinbase account.  This is a new technology, it isn’t perfected yet, it is clumsy.  It is not managed by any authority in the sense that no government can print more BTC or change interest rates as they do with fiat.  BTC is managed by mathematics and open market trading.  Nobody can control the number of BTC or assign their value.  The exchanges function as a safer market for people to buy and sell with confidence and security.  But anyone can take their BTC to anybody else and do peer to peer.

Yeah, seemed low to me.  Ledger x is more of a gambling company but that’s the number they came up with.  They are buying the coins (hopefully) at 8 k and the customer would have to pay them 10k so they are guaranteed to make 2k profit.  If coins are below 10k then they make 2.25k if the buyer loses.  So ledgerx can’t lose unless BTC is below 6k.  The customer only wins if BTC really exceeds over 12k and they can buy them at a discount or if bitcoin crashes and they only lose 2.25k instead of full 8k.  So ledger x is saying they want BTC to be above 6k and customers want it to be to the moon.

Not everybody wants to deal with wallets and seeds.  Buy options and ledgerx deals with the details.  This is betting on bitcoin without having to keep it yourself.  Also if you’re worried BTC is going to crash, this option only has a 2.25k loss.  So I can lose 8k but a ledgerx customer can never lose more than 2.25k even if BTC crashes to $0.  Got it?

It is never safe to put BTC into that address again and less safe on that device.  This person is selling their nano because it is now useless and dangerous for BTC.  Only buy from factory or amazon,

Look at any chart of BTC price.  It has appreciated 700% in 6 months so yes it is better than any S&amp;P stock in history.  But don’t look at it as only a investment, it is a technology.  Think of it like cell phones, internet usage, emails and online shopping.  They went from nothing to everything.  Buying a BTC is like buying a share of Facebook before it went public.

Good post.   Also, remember that as new coins get minted, they become a smaller percentage of the total in circulation so they have a smaller impact over time.   Also remember, bitcoin doesn’t actually need any money to change the price.   If everybody decides to hold, the price can go to 10k with no new investment in actual fiat.  Our current run up on price isn’t a 1:1 ratio of fiat investment to BTC price.  The price is speculation + demand?!?

Even the miners currently out there could collude to do this.  And that would cause BTC to become worthless and render their millions of dollars of equipment useless.  An outside party would have to purchase more miners than are currently in existence without their identities being known, so also unlikely but possible.

If you don’t need that $50 and you have other investments through your work (401k) then I’d think it’s s fun experiment.  Buy a tiny bit of BTC this month, a tiny bit of eth next month, a tiny bit of Ltc and just start to HODL.

Yes, people been saying that from 1k to 10k.  Invest in regular intervals and you’ll get the average price.  If BTC is going to collapse you would lose it all anyway and if we’re going to 50k then it wouldn’t make much difference if you bought at 9k or 8.8k or 9.2k.  Just decide if you want in the game and play long.

It is a Ponzi scheme, like everything in life.  You must have the internet to live and the price goes up, you need a smartphone and the prices rise, you need Netflix and the dues increase, BTC offers advantages over fiat and people jump in.  FYI - I’ve spent more than 6k in bitcoin in the real world, Gyft and Overstock.  I just bought Southwest Airlines tickets with gift cards that I bought from Gyft using bitcoin proceeds.

Correct, BTC needs time, liquidity and more spending options.  Growing up still as currency.   Look at ETH as a crypto that is less inflationary and more customer grounded maybe?

Wow, financial advice from John Stockton!  Cool!  So you’re on the bitcoin reddit but think everyone else here is dumb.  As if everyone here sold all their stocks and jumped into BTC or never had any stocks to begin with.

@_date: 2018-03-25 15:01:22
Yeah, I’m not too concerned about BTC becoming a world currency.  It’s a new type of bankless credit card but it is still only valuable when it exchanges for fiat.  At the end of the day you are spending electricity to hash a code and you can’t force the rest of the world’s population to take your code and give you food and gasoline if they don’t want to.  
Also, guess what happens when people feel excluded or controlled by a system....they break out and create a new one.  Just the same way you are challenging the banks and stock market built over the last hundred years....your kids will ignore your bitcoin wealth and create some other stupid new fad to evade your outdated system.

You need a business account with coinbase or Gemini.  Using a paper wallet would be stupid because how do you control who has access?  1 person or 2 people?  Where do you keep it?  What if they leave your company or just steal the coins.  Set up an account at coinbase with known people who have access.  They can put your coins in a “vault” and they can’t be moved in less than 48hrs and they send multiple notifications so 1 guy at your company can’t steal them without everybody knowing.

Correct.  Probably Only a small percent of transactions are going from consumer to retailer.  The high fees of dec/Jan made bitcoin unusable for everyday transactions (gas stations/grocery stores).

Omg.  The USD is the single fiat currency trusted worldwide.  It is the denomination for oil (energy) and the most valued bond.  The value of the dollar is not backed directly in gold, but it is backed directly by our strong economy, food supply, natural resources and the only army on earth that has military bases in other countries and a navy that maintains the world’s ocean shipping channels and an Air Force/space program that keeps our airspace clear. 
Bitcoin is a digital code who’s hashrate is controlled by Chinese mining pools.  I own it because it has utility and will challenge traditional credit cards and payment processing.  Btc or something similar will become the currency of the internet.  Not fast enough and not trustworthy enough to be the world currency.

Incorrect, crypto is still priced in terms of fiat and the US dollar is king.  When inflation hits, the dollar drops and you have higher prices on all commodities and probably BTC as well.  
It will be subtle but USD values affect global prices of everything, oil, energy, food, manufactured goods, wages, rates.  It won’t be enough to stop BTC crashing but all else being equal.

1) if the price is going up, why would I spend it.  Read about deflationary currency. 
2) govt can’t stop you from having it but they can regulate companies who buy/sell/trade it.  Banks and credit cards can make it hard to get
3) money is going digital.  No doubt.  But credit cards and banks already have millions of customers and vendors and offer fraud and theft protection.  It would be easier for them to make their own digital coin rather than build BTC into a credit card company.  You’ll probably see a fragmented market with various coins filling in gaps where fiat is inefficient, cross border, dark markets, gaming platforms, naughty internet things.  
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:37:33
Yes, but as I’ve stated before and others, this is no different than the leveraged crypto trading that happens everywhere or buying on your credit card as an advance.  I’m sure that bitfinex has SOME percent of tethers printed in hand....just like a trader at 5x leverage.  The game works as long as the price goes up and nobody calls your position...but when it drops, it drops quickly because everyone was buying crypto without having the actual money and having no money left to buy the dip
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:35:15
You are using the wrong words.  Bitcoin is not “backed” by electricity.  Electricity is a cost of using and running BTC.
A dollar bill isn’t backed by cotton paper and ink.  It is printed using those ingredients.  The value of a dollar comes from the country printing it.  The value of a BTC comes from the belief that people will want them more in the future and that btc has utility over other payment systems.

You can’t manipulate the price against a single country.  A whale can’t control where the demand is coming from.

That is a good theory and kinda holds true but it won’t protect us if interest in bitcoin fails.  Thats like saying a restaurant can raise their menu prices based on their costs.

But how many businesses have experience and  feels secure enough to hold bitcoin or give employees access to bitcoin wallets.  This only works for smaller self owned businesses.  The owner of a larger company would have difficulty keeping up with all the accounting, security, latest wallets, encryption, forks etc and still try to run a business.  
Most businesses outsource payment processing even for fiat transactions.  Most businesses outsource payroll, insurance, security, Human Resources, furniture, custodial, data storage etc.  These are all unnecessary intermediates..... unless you are busy 24-7 running a business....Just saying don’t hate on companies that offer a valuable service just because you don’t need it.

Price and difficulty have no direct relation.  Difficulty is determined by hashrate.  
They kinda correlate in the sense that lower prices make other altcoins more profitable so miners go elsewhere and the BTC difficulty may slowly drop but this is a human choice, not the math of BTC.  
Also, the difficulty adjusts so that the flow of BTC is roughly even.  If the price keeps dropping then nothing can make mining profitable except holding those coins and waiting for a better price.

A better way to contribute to the long term stability of bitcoin is to buy some, spend some, keep some.  Reward retailers with BTC spending and get them into the game.  Get amazon and alibaba and big tech into the mix when they see the buying power of $100 billion worldwide.  Then they will support the consumers over the miners.  Naive on my part or reality?

More importantly the amount of BTC in circulation vastly outnumbers the small amount of new coins per day or week or month.  Like a drip of new coins vs a swimming pool of existing coins.  Again I think you’re looking at a tiny thing and trying to correlate it but it just doesn’t.

Someday.  But today you still first need a bank account or credit card to even buy bitcoin unless you use an ATM (fees) or do it in cash (risky).  And most US exchanges require KYC drivers license or some ID that many poor or immigrants don’t have 
The problem isn’t technology...its access.  Visa prepaid cards have an unfair regulatory advantage.  There are no rules against prepaid cards at every gas station but they treat bitcoin like you’re a terrorist.  That will have to change at the government level at some point. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:12:06
I completely agree with paragraph 2.  The Govt creates and regulates demand-pull inflation and that is happening right now.  Consumers, wages and energy prices create cost-push inflation.  Wages are only one part of the equation
Again, wages have been fairly stagnant for the American family, energy prices are low, lending rates are low....so the 2-3 percent inflation is healthy but being primarily driven by govt activities in the demand-pull category to pump the economy IMHO.  At some point they will have to turn down the flow and increase lending rates??

I’d honestly look to diversify a little in crypto and companies that are driving blockchain growth.  Some stock traded companies are growing as they sell more electronics  behind crypto mining grow.

More users = bigger economy = more demand
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:24:17
You don’t think that debt issuance and below zero interest rates will contribute to inflation?  Maybe we are supposed to be in deflation but govt spending kept us above zero?  The recent global recession only pushed inflation down for 6 months, the government bought every bank’s bad debt and the fed bought as much bond debt (QE) as possible.  That kept the markets solvent, prevented deflation and lead to a major bull run in every commodity.  Natural gas discoveries and fracking have created cheap energy.  Again, we should probably still be in a deflationary recession but....what would cause inflation when energy is cheap and the population isn’t growing fast???

Well, BTC is decentralized.  It has no bosses, it can’t pay salaries, it can’t negotiate contracts because it is stateless.  That is perfect for some people but I see it as a recipe to be outcompeted and out paced.  Most coins are shit.  Some are novel and elegant and they have leaders who can pay for faster development and can form contracts with real world companies.  That seems like they can be more adaptive and proactive and better funded to solve issues.

I think that is realistic.  It is good, but probably won’t take over the world.  Or even if crypto takes over the world it will evolve into something different from the current.  It will disrupt many international payment systems and credit cards but it won’t take down the feds anytime soon.

You will see 100 applications of blockchain in 5 years.  Some private, some public, some decentralized, mostly centralized, some will be “currency” but most will be tracking systems and supply chain is my guess.  It’s benevolent, they aren’t competing with bitcoin, just testing a similar ledger system for other applications.

Fiat is an IOU backed by an organizing body (govt) that has the ability to tax its citizens and raise an army to protect itself.  
The govt tries to keep the economy running so that it can continue to collect taxes and sustain itself.  Sometimes govts make good decisions with their investment and sometimes they don’t.  Removing currency from the role of govt takes away one tool at their disposal but it does not remove the need to collect taxes and protect the realm, provide roads and schools etc.

I am also concerned but I’m not sure a grass roots legal campaign will really hold together.  
1) any open source white paper project is already public domain
2) The payments and wallet interface is going to be a huge business in the future and it will be dominated by corporations eventually.  
3) if the banks succeed with patents they will start investing in crypto and push adoption because they know they will profit!  Win for bitcoin holders.  
4) if the patents stifle innovation then China and Korea will lead the innovation because they don’t acknowledge patents and then American companies will scramble to catch up once they see the outflow of money.  
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:09:18
So the LN won’t be a quick solution to mass adoption.  I don’t see many people leaving their credit cards to use commitment transactions at the grocery store.  This means we will need software developers and companies to build better interfaces to go from paycheck to groceries without even having to understand paper wallets and revocation keys.  And if that’s the case we are recreating all the middlemen that charge nominal fees and control the flow of money that we are supposedly trying to disrupt.  
I still own bitcoin but I’ve come to the conclusion that we are just recreating next generation credit card networks with a better backbone and easier for international payments.  Out with the old boss (banks), in with the new boss (exchanges).  The New boss (miner fees) is the same as the old boss (transfer fees).  I’m not looking for a response, I know technology takes time.  But all the banks and credit cards are currently patenting payment methods and testing their crypto apps so they can jump right back into the same game.  The original bitcoin blockchain is still available for money laundering and drug dealing but the future kids and moms will just use CryptoVisa and MasterCoin and AmazonBucks and only dads will use the real bitcoin on their hidden trezors!

Exactly, so not only are there fewer bitcoins to soak up but the miners want to get a higher price for each one.  The well funded miners might try to hold them until the price rises.  The weaker miners will have to fold and the network will establish a new equilibrium over a couple months.  Either way, if the BTC demand is equal, but the BTC supply decreases it is a catalyst for price growth.  And because everybody knows this will happen then the FOMO starts early and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

That is mostly true.  But you’re only seeing progress in the major hubs and it isn’t sustainable without western food supplies and their air is toxic because they manufacture without reservation.  But visit western China and you’re back to 1940s.  Visit Japan and Singapore and Hong Kong and you’re in the future but not every corner of Asia is caught up.  
Another reason is that some of those countries missed the industrial revolution and went straight to Tech revolution (Singapore).  Western cities are burdened with old brick and steel infrastructure and outdated railways designed to bring coal to the manufacturing yards and ship grain to the ports.  They are decaying around an old paradigm and must be rebuilt from within and move to new paradigm and lifestyle.

Uggghhhh, your post doesn’t even make sense.  No wonder delfin likes it.  How can only Americans lose on bitcoin?  Are only Americans buying at the high and then selling only to other countries on the low?  If anything Americans win win if we build more and safer exchanges and create jobs in the USA and people want to invest here.  Also when poorer smaller countries gain in wealth they tend to convert back to USD and they also gain more purchasing power to buy US goods and food and they use more oil.  When Chinese get rich they buy American pork and wheat, then we get richer and buy more cheap electronics from China, then they get richer and buy more US bonds and real estate, then we get rich and build more factories and create jobs and get richer, then we import more raw materials and metal to build more military airplanes and they get rich, then they buy those F18’s and we get richer.

People need a currency or unit of exchange.  It could be units of energy or industrial metals but they are hard to transfer.  Paper fiat is a representation of the strength of a govt to run the economy and collect taxes.  There is also convenience that businesses and bills can be paid in that currency in every situation.  Digital currency is the next logical step in money evolution, the drawback is that participation is voluntary so you could end up somewhere that doesn’t accept your chain.  Or a new chain can be created at any time.  A compromise of all of the above is likely.

You can remove banks from the process and store owners can get paid faster for sure but I was thinking more “point of sale” 
1) kid at register scans items and bill is $95.72
2) no payment software so kid at register has to check the price of bitcoin and convert $95.72 to bitcoin for the customer.
3) present QR code to customer and customer sends bitcoin 
4) kid at register has to check and confirm that payment is cleared so customer can leave store
5) as owner of store I have cash register receipts that I have to match back to entries into the BTC wallet.  This is necessary for taxes and inventory. 
6) the price of BTC has dropped or increased 10% that day so its a pain in the ass to even figure out what I sold or didn’t sell that day in inventory. 
Real world solution:  payment platforms integrate the cash register to the swipe machine and confirms payments while also creating a transaction record associated with the inventory sold.  Kid at register keeps scanning and store owner doesn’t spend 2 hours after work reconciling deposits.

The next time you swipe your credit card at the gas pump ask yourself how the pump would turn on if you swiped your tether wallet, there is no human present, software will need to determine price, confirm you have available tether prior to pumping and confirm the volume pumped them confirm your final bill and tax information and also record that transaction on the gas companies ledger.  Software talking to software talking to mechanical systems talking to networks and databases....1000 times per day every day within seconds.  
I’ll continue my assumption that payment services and software companies are loving the future of crypto and they will not be displaced by a white paper about peer to peer payments because payments aren’t peer to peer or even peer to business as I described above.

The payment layers and processing companies are agnostic to the type of payment, the payment layers exist so company owners can focus on their business and they don’t have to check that your bitcoin confirmed at the cash register 1000 times per day at 10 different registers and at 50 stores in 5 states.  How could you have time to check at every register unless you have middlemen to do the job for you and guarantee payment is clean. 
Middlemen aren’t a necessity because of fiat, they are a necessity because business owners want to pay middlemen to save time and reduce risk in processing orders at 2am.  It will be the same for bitcoin and credit cards and Apple Pay etc.  just my thoughts

Yes, i am very knowledgeable in such.  But a few idealistic kids can’t buy enough bitcoin to maintain the price in the face of so much selling pressure so the price is still dropping despite the “buy the dip” mentality.  
Those who have been buying the dip since 17k are just the bag holders for people exiting their positions.  As people realize that we’re not going to 20k tomorrow the bleed continues.

So if I have no understanding of it....then who does understand it and how will they drive it to the masses who also don’t understand it and honestly won’t invest the time to figure it out.  
99% of people don’t really understand the physics behind the electricity that arrives at their house, 50% don’t even understand the electrical wiring in their house and fuses....but everybody knows how to plug their toaster into the wall socket so they use a shitload of electricity everyday without caring or knowing or learning how it works and they pay somebody else to make it for them.  
How do we metaphorically get from white papers to universal wall sockets?

Correct, bitcoin can’t be a world currency (slow) and it can’t even become useful without other layers and payment systems that ironically don’t rely on POW and operate more like a pre-paid Visa card.

No, the rate of new coins doesn’t change and miners don’t control the price.  There have been huge macroeconomic trends and awareness in 2017 that affected the price and also hundreds of altcoins that appeared overnight.  Also the bitcoin fees and wait times grew exponentially in December.  Lots of things affect price but hashrate and difficulty are insignificant to that story.

The price would start to rise as soon as he started buying up sell orders so it would get harder and harder, then other existing limit sell orders would be triggered.  And then the arbitrage opportunity would exist on that exchange so other bots would immediately start buying elsewhere and selling to the drunk millionaire and would dampen his effects.  
That number they show in the depth charts is a static number of existing sell orders on one exchange but the price would increase into the hundreds of millions if one person tried to move the price that much.

Yes, America is becoming a shit hole of personalities and I won’t go into an argument for the reasons. 
But to say that Asians (especially china) aren’t racist or hateful is hilariously wrong.  Those are mono cultures and China is very racist and their education ingrains their superiority.  They think they have the tallest mountains and the biggest rivers and the oldest cultures and the first human civilization with culture (partly correct).  
They are the most respectful to each other, and they are great at business respect, but many are still prejudiced against other Asian countries and Africans.  Don’t tell me that’s an American creation because it is a global problem.

I honestly don’t even remember the OP in this thread.  I want BTC to have utility and value because I want the price to increase so I want mass adoption.  
The value proposition is different for everybody.  Online dealing and gambling and porn and money laundering are easy to understand the utility and value.  Anti bank and anti govt types also have an easy love for crypto too.  Soccer moms have no love for crypto because they are too fucking busy to deal with price swings and setting up private keys and they are already well served by the credit card business.  
How does BTC bridge to soccer moms at the grocery store (mass adoption).  Been arguing this all day!?!  I don’t think LN will do it but I think existing credit cards and banks will figure out how to get women into crypto without it being so hard.  Women would buy crypto and mine it on their damn cell phone if it was a rewards card that gave them points at retail stores.  IMHO.  
It seems intuitive to me that a marriage of new tech and traditional credit cards is inevitable for mass adoption.

The exact scenario you describe is already possible with stocks.  If we just all agree to buy Amazon stock and we all agree to only buy from amazon then they will be the biggest company in the world and the price will go up and we all win but some key stakeholders would become trillionaires.  This doesn’t happen.  Not everybody would buy amazon due to CHOICE and COMPETITION.  Some people would see other stores as a better and cheaper option and try to buy it up.  And after some become millionaires they would diversify for safety.  Some kids will think some new brand is cooler and stop using their parents amazon.

The hashrate does not adjust or scale back to prices.  That is completely incorrect.  The mining difficulty adjusts to the hashrate but the price could be 1 cent or 1 million.  
Yes, there is a cost to mining and of course miners want to stay profitable but that is no guarantee either.  They’ve already bought the equipment and warehouses so they need to keep mining and hope for better days.  If they turn off their miners and go out of business that will lower the competition and other miners thereby become more profitable.  
Again, if demand in the real world drops then nobody cares what the breakeven point for miners is.

Why would anyone pay a fee to buy a gold ETF when they can just buy it anywhere?  
Convenience.  
Also ETFs can be included in retirement savings plans and grow tax free.  You are also transferring the risk of losing your gold and having to insure it to the gold stocks.  That’s a huge advantage.

2) very little of the price is based on fundamental earnings or valuation so there’s no correlation.  It’s all sentiment and speculation.  You can’t correlate earnings to market cap like a stock.  So there are no predictive indicators.  When a whale starts to secretly buy or sell you won’t know

That number is just stroking your ego.  It isn’t necessarily adoption or utility or new vendors that accept BTC.  It’s just feeding your ego that you picked this coin and it’s bigger than the other coins.

I don’t care about the argument because I’m neither a bank or a business but your statements are false.  Banks do not touch the pot industry either because it is risky at the federal level and the rules are changing.  Banks would make tons of money from pot but they have to follow the existing rules.  Credit cards can’t process payments from US customers to known offshore casinos.  The credit cards would make tons of money but they would be complicit so they have to follow the existing rules.  
I have never seen 1 credible story of a bank blocking a private citizen from buying or selling bitcoin in amounts that comply with AML.  Otherwise millions of accounts would be closed.

My understanding of history and the future.
1. Banks protected gold and physical assets in vaults. 
2. Banks protect paper money
3. Banks become the major source of lending and financing with all that money sitting around
4. Banks become tools of the govt money printing machine.  Interest rates become one tool to control the economy, taxes are another. 
5. Crypto arrives. 
6. We will still need businesses to store large amounts of coins and valuables, 
7. We will still need lending and financing
8. New age banks will still be run by greedy and selfish assholes that manipulate the system to benefit themselves and shareholders and the wealthy.  See coinbase.  Or maybe I’m wrong but middlemen and “money handlers” are as old as civilization.

Worked for USDT even though they have no legit backing.  And regarding the real (USD) I can spend that coin (usd) anywhere and that coin is backed by the largest army in the world, with the largest GDP, the most food supply and half the nukes?  That sounds better than a coin backed by Chinese miners and unknown whales.  Both have certain pros and cons but I would expect the usd to be around another century

I envy your knowledge of societal theory.   Mine comes from Evolutionary theory, a career in Science and watching National Geographic.  females want to breed with the strongest males with the most territory so their offspring have best odds of survival.  Males seek to conquer, control and expand their territory.  Every herd species builds a hierarchy for safety and survival. 
Every human house has a fence around the yard...it isn’t for protection so why do we need to mark our territory so precisely? Why do we spend billions of dollars watching strong men play football or kick a ball?  Why do we spend most of our money on adornments, clothing and other status symbols.  None of these things improve our collective survival...they are all processes to stratify ourselves and mark our territory.  We are potty trained primates and that explains why education suffers and the Kardashian’s are famous.  Hoping for utopia is a lofty goal but I place my bets on humans being greedy and inefficient.

Well yes, coinbase is the worst, they give you the worst price always.  But if that’s where your money is then it doesn’t matter what the price is in South Korea.  I use Gemini, kraken and bitstamp.

Read reply from atomic goat below.  They are also being realistic about the state of development and probability of existing payment platforms to poach the bitcoin trend over the next 10 years. 
Mostly, the open and decentralized nature of bitcoin is forever secured, I don’t disagree.  But Everything that goes on top of bitcoin is now additional checkpoints and centralization if you want to make it so easy that soccer moms use it at the grocery store without even knowing it.  Of course there will be more open source and decentralized exchanges and networks etc...but again, existing banks are making regulated exchanges and patents so who is the grocery store going to sign a contract with...the visa bitcoin network or Shapeshifter.

Not exactly, if demand for bitcoin is increasing faster than supply it can still be deflationary in terms of price because each coin gains in value each year whereas the general term of inflationary means that each dollar loses value because more money is printed without any gold backing.
