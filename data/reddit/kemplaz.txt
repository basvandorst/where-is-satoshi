This is one of the best podcasts out. Everyone should give it a listen, even if its not your cup of tea the production alone is worth it. One of the few podcasts I would pay for

Doesn't $5 allow the hackers to see and read all my data going through their networks? Sounds like a huge security risk.!

I'm open to suggestions, how can I get coins and from where with out have to give away all my personal Information? 
@_date: 2016-09-20 00:08:19
Just looking for a fast easy way that's secure for me.  Not trusting these sites asking for my photo ID and credit card etc..  It shouldn't be this difficult to get low amounts if coins for new users

How would he have access to send the coins. At the cabin no phone or internet etc etc  I can't even get my wife to use the remote to my new tv how would Walt explain to  Skyler how to use bitcoins

Brain wallet sure that could work if Walt had a smart phone or computer and was able to contact Skyer. Sadly he has no access to any of these items in his cabin that he's not suppose to leave.
