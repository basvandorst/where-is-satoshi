Man a lot of reddit warriors wanting to kick you while you are down. Enough already people, the dude’s house caught on fire.
I’d shop around some well known data recovery companies and tell them flat out you will give them 5 bitcoin if they recover the data. Surely somebody would jump at the chance to make over $14k and you still walk away with 12 BTC...oh and 17 BCH, lol.

Agreed with comment above. Pretty much all of the hacks and lost money you might have read about came from hacked exchanges like coinbase and wallets that either weren’t backed up and were lost or weren’t secure enough.
Definitely do a practice run with a small initial investment to find out how the system and transfers work.

Please do sell so I can pick up some more!

 Huh? Market cap is a direct result of the price. That’s like saying we need the price to go up 30% so the price can go up 30%.

Also, don’t invest money you can’t stand to lose. There is no guarantee bitcoin will be around in 10 years but if it is it should go much higher.
So it’s a bit like betting everything on one number at roulette right now.

Give it about 30min to an hour and you should be good, nothing is probably wrong.
Edit: sorry just saw it was 3 hours ago. Not sure unfortunately.

Yeah mine took about 7 hours to even be transmitted ��
Frustrating since coinbase makes you think it’s been sent immediately.

Kind of a noob question but thought about this as I was waiting 7 hours for coinbase to even send my transaction.
Can we use a third party app to get access to the wallet on coinbase and skip their rules/delays?

I spoke with who I think is well educated investor, he had invested in GBTC because he didn’t know how to acquire bitcoin, how to safely store large amounts of coin and didn’t know that you can buy fractions of coin so he figured this was the next best thing.
I realize the irony, I look to him for investment advice all the time and after I explained that he could own the actual asset, not spend 1.80 for every 1.00 worth and invest even $5.00 at a time he realized how dumb it was. He’s also made me some money as well so I guess it my turn to help him out.
I believe the premium is just a huge misunderstanding about investing in bitcoin.

Noob question. What in this video is different from a normal bitcoin wallet transaction? Faster confirmations?
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:27:24
Can’t disagree on the illiquidity part, definitely a combination of market errors begging to be corrected.

Thanks, I'll look into that!

Again still a newbie but from what I understand the biggest risk of the split is using an exchange that doesn't support the latest methods. If you have your coins held in that exchange you might not be able to use them or lose them. If you try to do a transaction on the wrong chain then you will have issues as well.
So the best plan is to keep them in your control and wait it out.

If you are strictly asking about the values then the only result would be that the US Dollar would lose value and therefore a Bitcoin would cost more. Nothing else is possible in that scenario.
Of course it depends on how much money they printed as it would have to be significant to make a big difference. This also wouldn't be a smart move as a response to Bitcoin as it would just deflate the US Dollars value in all things worldwide, not just Bitcoin.
If they want to fight Bitcoin, it will be in the form of regulations and taxes. Not printing money.

Thanks a hardware wallet is definitely in my future.

Phew, glad I am not the only one!
