you are smart man
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:45:08
it will short it self. 
don't worry
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:29:59
right. technically 3 million is no limit, but it's logical limit.
Of course you can set the price on exchange to what ever you want, but is not likely that you will sell it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:39:09
dude, bitfinex 15900$
it looks baaad
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:36:45

I have to buy my BTCs somewhere else. Then transfer BTCs to Bitfinex to trade with.

better 17k, then 19k
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:51:23
1) It has no practical use comparing to other cryptos
2) it is overpriced for long period of time
3) BCash (and others) work against him. See coinbasescandal.
4) some other reasons
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:35:01
ooo nooo, its going down again
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:59:41
I like Muslims
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:44:07
There is no resistance at all, at Bitfinex
if BTC falls bellow 17 K, it goes straight down to 15 K.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:00:16
you are rich  ;)
wanna marry a handsome guy ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:16:21
this is very unlikely.
you can print money only to some extent. After that you have hyper inflation.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:49:42
maybe 3 digits in long term
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:46:08

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:05:37
boosting down or up ? that's the question.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:08:20
nobody knows. Maybe there will be no interest at all and nothing happens.
We will see in few weeks.
The main concern here is that now possibility exists to speculate against BTC with "big money". You can never trust a government.

Trading will begin, under the ticker symbol "XBT," at the start of global trading hours at Sunday 6 p.m. ET
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:16:33
down, down, down...
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:50:41
don't worry. It's not all about many
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:39:41

An insider told me that the price will go up to 100 million $ in 5 years. 
Let's sell our houses, cars and insurances, buy Bitcoins and just HODL.
Let's all be rich.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:18:17
at the end all exchange will "be hacked", leaving us with 0
how do we know if it is really hacked, or they took money for them selves. We can't know.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:36:56
with which money ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:32:11
sure. the biggest one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:08:56
I can't watch this anymore. am gonna sell all my 57 Bitcoins now
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:01:23
run forrest run !
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:00:59
not likely
there are probably some market manipulations going on
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:00:35
Bitcoin is going down.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:55:54
let's open praying subreddit
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:05:38
oh noo, it's going down again.
am gonna sell my 0.5 BTC 
this is impacting my health
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:33:39
no. the sold amount of BTC goes to another owner.
if everybody wants to sell, then is it hard to find the buyer, what again drives the price down.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:55:29
Coinbase is average, and binance shows the actual price on this exchange
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:18:07
someone is in seling moode
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:37:18
bitfinex at 16100 $
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:37:12
buy now, sell later
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:19:54
BAKC up
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:43:46
I told you
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:32:20
of course I can.
every exchange has own price, because this price is based on the actual sells/buys on this particular exchange.
Other exchange has other buyers and sellers , so the sells/buys will be different from exchange to exchange.
Some people have capital on all exchanges, so if there is difference in price, they will buy where the price low, and sell where the price is high. So,at the end, all exchanges gravitates towards same price.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:06:25
there is a reason. 
There is not enough money in the WORLD.
70 Trillion $ (all money) divided on 21 million Bitcoins  = 3 million $ per coin.
very simply. That's the theoretically max value.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:06:30
nobody knows. it's kind of a gamble
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:30:34
die bitch, die
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:47:27
I wish we could go back to the time when BTC was 300$ and all were nice to each other.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:48:27
SELL, tomorrow will it be worth less
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:19:45
he was a good coin. rip
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:05:32
minimum price for Bitcoin is 1$
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:43:05
30 $.
How do you sleep ?
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:07:09
I bought 1 BTC for 22.000 $ from my good friend.
he said, it's a good deal because exchange fees are so high now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:06:03
I use Bitfinex. It's the biggest one.
But credit card deposit and withdraw is not possible in US.
Also some other countries are restricted.
But, you can transfer directly BTC and trade with them.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:09:56
are memes allowed here ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:18:57
wait until it is 10 $
It will never go up again.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:52:48
correct. every exchange has own prices, depending on actual sells and buys.
therefore it's always good to have capital in every exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:33:09
there is negative trend.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:59:28

if Bitcoin goes to the moon, then Litcoin goes at least to the Mount Everest
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:35:21


satoshi is dead baby.
satoshi is dead.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:54:45
because, I really think it is. At least for Bitcoin.
You can't have coin, where transaction fee is so high.
I used Etherium today, it was only 0.3$.
 we are just riding a dead horse.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:51:36
mate, there is not enough money in the whole world.
If the whole money in the world would be spent on BTC, 1 BTC would be 3 million. 
See the posts below. I explained it there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:37:30
no one. the party seems to be over.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:03:01
it was only 500$
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:22:29
don't buy the f* dips. you are just loosing money.
let it drop to the lowest point, where it is stable for 1 week and then buy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:10:55
I feel better now
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:48:32
Bitcoin is a Japanese product.

@_date: 2017-12-08 23:49:11
It's never too late.
But keep in mind that one Bitcoin can't go over 3 million US $.
So the growth is limited.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:44:46
you mean 10$ or 10K  ? :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:11:49
good luck anyway
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:47:45

@_date: 2017-12-10 14:10:07
Bought for 13.000 and panic sold yesterday at 12.800.
but now BTC is up to 15.000
why God, why ?
I will buy now again, but keep  until 50.000
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:08:55

@_date: 2017-12-08 06:20:41
I understand.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:18:38
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:52
bitfinex is more relevant because of more volume.
It will level out.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:42:37
I bought now for 50 $. 
In 10 years it will 500.000 $. Yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:38:48
