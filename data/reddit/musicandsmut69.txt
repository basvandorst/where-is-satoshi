Nice, thanks for clarification ;)
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:07:14
Any idea why do they say Dec17/18 on their FAQ? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:27:51
Its never late to buy more :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:06:21
Still holding at 7.5K lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:58:49
to the moon!

Sounds about right, not talking about the new TBBT episode about bitcoin going out in 2-3 days.. that should help as well.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:34:02
Its going crazy up and down today, so I would say day trading ;) (but only a part, the other part should be on HODL!)
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:14:54
Ah sorry, didn't know about that.. What's your preferred source for BTC news then?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:21:44
in a minute :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:25:07
hope no-one wants to cash out that at once
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:27:04
lucky you, congrats :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:31:45

@_date: 2017-11-25 14:25:17

Unfortunately I don't think if you have any other options then to have money sitting at exchanges if you really want to jump on sudden dips. (while you don't want to pay extra fee's for quick deposit)
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:28:33
below 9.3k :|
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:18:28
Congrats :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:19:59
yeah getting tired of it as well :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:04:14
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:20:35
whoa that hurts even for me
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:39:53
Pure awesomeness!
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:23:44
I think people would like to invest in BTC mainly those ones who are afraid of inflation/hyperinflation.. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:40:11
Bought some at 92xx so lets hope it goes up now :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:13:42
sms at bitstamp :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:09:55
Very nice, this dip recovered quite fast!
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:42:56
Looks like the dip has to do something with this 
However with quantum computers most of the current encryption are worthless, so not sure why the panic.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:54
Bitsamp the same
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:48:56
Since when is bitcoin.com a malicious spam site? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:23:55
yeah it sucks
