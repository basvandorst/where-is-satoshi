Don't pretend to know my situation. I have worked everyday since I was 15, 28 now. I got assaulted by 3 meth addicts and they broke my back in 3 places. 3 crushed vertebrae. So, I haven't been able to work and it's put me in this situation. You think I'm proud to beg for money? It's humiliating. Also, I do have my phone listed for sale and that is not my fucking car! Why be a dick to me when you don't have any reason to?

Thanks, but the blockchain sent it back to my wallet about an hour ago.

Not sure why this is down voted. Seems like a good idea.

Thanks for the advice. We're looking forward to this.

Exactly. A scam, are you kidding me?

A percentage deposit and remainder upon completion.

Thanks for the info. Coinbase seems like it may be the way to go. I'll have to look into it more.

No, it was Android version. The 0.0001 fee was on there. Doesn't matter now though because the BTC was sent back to my wallet.

Oops. Sorry.

Do you know by chance if either one of those have a maximum USD transfer? Because our installs are easily $15k and up.

This is cool. I used to have all my gpu rigs setup on Betarigs to be leased out. Such an awesome site.
