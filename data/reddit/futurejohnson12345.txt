I can't believe Jones did this. This is bullshit. To be fair to everyone hating on him, I first learned about Bitcoin through Max Keiser who was at one time a frequent guest. Keiser has been  using bitcoin since the early days and really was a big proponent.
Honestly, I don't think this will have any effect because all the libertarians in that space already know about crypto and the other half think bitcoin is the mark of the beast...so yeah...

Just make sure you consider your opportunity costs. All time you spend studying art history could be spent doing something else.
I suggest you do a low-cost regionally accredited school that allows you to do online classes (NOT ITT or DEVRY). Also, I recommend CLEP exams. I was able to finish my bachelors in 2 1/2 years by doing clep exams and online classes at my brick and mortar school.
Save as much money as possible and do your school as quick as possible. Please do CLEP tests using the REA books to pass. I exempted almost an entire year or more of study doing that alone.
Spend more time on internships. Learn your industry.

I'm not a fan of anyone, but you have to know how far his reach is in terms of meme power. I literally wouldn't have heard of bitcoin without Max Keiser.
I put as much faith in Alex Jones as I do in WSJ, NYT, CNN, ABC, and every other three letter organization. Which is none. 
If you ever believed in these media outlets I hope their constant barrage of FUD and misinformation against crypto red pilled you.

Your university sucks.

You'd be better off putting your dough into a well-researched alt coin that can get you good returns and also open your own business. Are you sure you want to have a boss again after being in the service all this time?
School is a waste of time.

Did he ever give you permission to do this before his death? Otherwise you might want to consult a lawyer.

For docs lawyers architects etc yes anything that serves the public and needs minimum standards when dealing with the lives of others. But those people waste massive amounts of time on irrelevant subjects in college because of core classes.

He looks like the creature that birthed the Goonies. All these old geezers look the same.

Graduated with a 3.9 gpa honors and student of the year. It can be done. But I work in a field where the bachelors is absolutely necessary. I wish I would've just started a landscaping company. I would have more cash by now.
