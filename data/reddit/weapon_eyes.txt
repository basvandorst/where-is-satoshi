I know that for Android, there are widgets you can downolad that display the current value of BTC and other cc's. I have two on my home screen that display the USD value for BTC and ETH, which update once every 10 seconds.

I think something like that would have the same amount of practicality as, say, a  clock on a wall or someone's desk. It's definitely a badass idea, but I feel that given most people are either staring into their phones or monitors, that the practicality of utilising a physical device is somewhat stolen by that fact. However, I think quite a few people would still buy one if it existed - especially if each one exists as a unique piece of craftsmanship. It does still have the potential to be utilized, as well as possessing a sense of novelty that many would find value in owning. Either way it sounds like an awesome project, and if you wanted to, you could sell them for BTC

Hahaha, whoops ��. Well in that case, I think a **physical** ticker would be awesome!

If someone with enough USD wanted to trade it for every remaining available BTC, then I figure the value of each BTC would skyrocket. Everyone else holding theirs would exchange it back to USD for profit, replinishing the market with tons of recently sold bitcoins. The value would probably decrease drastically, but still stay pretty high, while people continue to exchange on the market. As for the market crashing, I don't think that would happen, though someone with a greater knowledge of economics can correct me if I'm wrong. The value of btc would definitely be determined by whether or not the person who bought up the remaining bitcoins decides to sell or hoard them. Hoarding them would create scarcity, selling them creates a surplus. I think the fact that there are only a limited number of bitcoin that will ever exist (I think it's 21 million btc) is actually fucking awesome since it protects the market from extreme inflation

I remember it took me about a week to get verified

Dumbest shit I've ever read

I know, I'm being facetious, lol. I don't have much invested anyway

See, what gets me is when I read [about senators proposing anti-money laundering bills with ambiguous wording]( that could implicate normal users in a crime, given the verbal structuring of the bill. 
“Section 13 would amend to include funds stored in a digital format within the definition of monetary instruments. This would effectively subject those devices to anti-money laundering reporting requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act, in cases where the value stored is above $10,000.”
"Funds stored on digital format"? Couldn't a "digital format" be nearly anything from someone's laptop to a "digital wallet", to even the blockchain itself? I feel the same way you do in regards to the future outcomes for Bitcoin, but with regulation comes control. If a bill such as the one posted above were to pass, doesn't the ambiguity of it's wording potentially implicate innocent individuals holding large amounts of assets in digital currency on "digital instruments" in a crime? I feel that bills such as this would tank the value of the coin because of the leverage the Govt would have over your assets as well as the risk involved if you accumulated "too much". I could understand taxation, but is it possible that BTC or other cryptocurrencies could be subjected to this type of "regulation"?

Are you asking what would happen if someone with enough money to purchase every bitcoin decided they wanted to? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:42:05
Lol so this might sound really obtuse, but what would stop someone from removing their BTC from an exchange, tumbling their coins, transferring it to an offline wallet and then lying about how much income they've accrued in BTC to the IRS? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:57:49
Yep just bought some more btc as it feels the time is right!

I'm totally all for this, but I also fear governmental overreach. I guess we'll see how it all goes down. This is the first time I've really been involved with investing of any type, so it's all kinda new to me (never messed with the stock market). Nevertheless, I find investing in BTC exhilarating, nerve wracking, and just plain interesting. As such, I try and be very cautious with how I invest. I treat it as if I am gambling responsibly. It's tempting to want to throw a shit ton of USD into BTC when it dips, but I'm also not expecting to get rich quick. I'm genuinely interested in BTC and cryptocurrency in general, and I want so bad to see it succeed in the future as a main form of money. Fuck the Federal Reserve, and all the other big banks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:12:52
I'm sure as shit not selling, and I'm damn sure not catching a falling knife either. If it starts making a steady ascent, I'm gunna try and buy in at the earliest possible moment that happens. But really who can predict any of this? If anything I'll hodl till I die

Controlling something and outright banning something are two different things with two different potential outcomes. My issue is that if the Government attempts to control BTC (not ban it necessarily), then would it have a disastrous effect on it's value? And further, if people are placing their assets into BTC, the Govt controlling it in ways that they garner leverage over your assets could be problematic. We also have to remember that drugs, alcohol, guns, or anything tangible that has been banned has never worked because the items are never physically destroyed in it's totality, or are under any "real" control aside from the black market. But BTC is intangible, and having intangible currency being regulated by government entities would afford them an advantage to shut it down since it's all digital and immaterial.

Haha, yeah, totally agree. Gotta play it smart. I've always considered myself a responsible gambler - only playing with what I can afford to lose. It would be nice to make a fat profit at some point, but I also like the idea behind cryptocurrency, and sort of see it as investing into the future of money. If that makes any sense. Anyway, good luck to you as well!

Set up an account on Gemini, then send your coin from CuckBase to your wallet on Gemini. Gemini will pretty much walk you through setting up your account. I'm set up there, and the site is super easy to navigate, and it looks nice as well. Good luck

Couldn't governments make it illegal to trade BTC for fiat currency?
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:22:35
Yeah, I figure I'll give it a couple more days before I contact support. I guess accounting for "business days", along with Monday having been a holiday, it's really been about 4 and a half days since I initiated the deposit. In any case, I've been relatively pleased with Gemini. The layout of the site makes it easy to navigate, and it only took about 1.5 days to verify my credentials and begin trading. I tried Coinbase first and it was a clusterfuck; I gave up registering midway because nothing was working right. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:25:32
Yeah, I'm gunna give it a couple more days before I contact support. I've already begun trading, but I can't move any btc since the trade was based on pre-credited funds.
