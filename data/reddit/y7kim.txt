you'd be surprised, QR codes have pretty good error correction built-in

Stop using Interac E-transfers.  They are reversible and CertaPay will blacklist you if you are involved in a fraudulent transaction.
What happened (probably) was you got paid for bitcoins from an online banking account that was compromised due to phishing.
Exact same thing happened to me.  I had to replay the amount in question, then my Interac was blocked forever.

In cases where fraud is suspected, the bank will immediately freeze your account, conduct an "investigation" and make a ruling a week of two later.  Then they will unfreeze your account with the amount in question debited. Then your interac e-transfer will be forever blacklisted.

Certapay is the national administrator for all banks and changing banks/emails won't work. I have tried nearly everything.  I was able to talk to somebody from CertaPay who removed the flag on my account but that lasted one transaction.  I have spent hours on the phone with a dozen different people.  Not worth it, plus fuck their fees.  Now i just have buyers deposit to my bank in person.  this is the best way.

All these personal attacks only detract from meaningful conversation and discussion of the topics at hand.  Do we really need to resort to attacking people's physical appearance?  It's fucking pathetic imo.

ah, a misunderstanding then. but I still stand by my comment.

They are sold out.  I think batch 3 was 75BTC. 
If you want a miner I would consider looking at Hashfast, KNC miner, coin Terra but I can't vouch for any of them
