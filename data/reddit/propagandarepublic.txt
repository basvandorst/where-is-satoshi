I think it did, thank you. Just read a few comments on how people were scared of it and how it could have effected bitcoins price

How is it hard work?

Is Gemini better than kraken?

If I have my bitcoins stored in mycelium would it be affected by the whole segwit release?
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:45:43
Would you recommend mycelium to own keys?

Instead of searching the news repeatedly, can't you just refresh and sell when it goes up a percentage and then buy again when it's down a percentage, and repeat?

So now we're being taxed for withdrawing our cryptos and now this utter bullshit? Makes me want to buy more and hodl. ��

I'm so confused with this whole segwit and block debate.
Can anyone ELI5?
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:31:12
Yeah if at least 100k of those donate a day I'll become a millionaire in ten days lol but whatever I guess this was a retarded idea ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:58:38
Yes it's always been this way, hence why crypto has been invented to transition out of this bullshit way.
@_date: 2017-09-25 05:17:04
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:40:24
I understand that, but there's no telling that they won't be implementing other rules and or regulations to make it harder for us to do that as well soon...
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:01:06
I noticed that too after I posted it :(
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:11:07
Thank you

Seriously... it should be "buy at dip now" or "assume dips lower and buy"
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:32:19
Talk about it! I want to learn more ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:06:56
I'm not bashing on Coinbase in this regards, what I'm upset at is the fact that this is slowly becoming a reality.
What kind of fucking world do we live in where we're being charged additional fees to buy another fucking currency?
If it's easy for us to trade cryptos why the fuck are these banks making our lives harder doing it? LITERALLY. I'm beginning to get really sick and tired of these banks man.
