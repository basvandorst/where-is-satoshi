Method not found means that a chunk of code that command is trying to reference is missing.  A method is a section of code designed to do something specific.
I've never used that command, is it possible that it was deprecated at some point?
If you're asking this question, I'm guessing you used an installer and didn't compile yourself from source, right?

Gavin has said before that he envisions a future where developers would commit to various repos/implementations.
Trying to spin this as "omg Classic is deadz and Gavin is crawling back to the almighty Core!!111" is stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:00:42
Isn’t that a centralizing effect since only the largest players will be able to afford to run completely free nodes at scale, and tragedy of the commons dictates that users will gravitate towards the lowest cost route?

When fees are as high as they are, it makes bitcoin impractical for a smaller transactions. If you think that businesses aren’t dropping bitcoin and moving to Litecoin and other chains that aren’t yet fully saturated, you’re deluding yourself. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:02:16
Wow, you sure convinced me with that well reasoned and detailed argument you just presented!  I totally withdraw my previous statement. :/
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:31:28
It can be when fees to open millions of new channels will make routing around it cost prohibitive. 
That’s why we need to mix both on and off chain scaling in a reasonable fashion. LN looks super awesome, but it’s not the answer standing alone.

I’m in support of larger blocks for BTC, have been for a long time.  
I was initially in favor of “emergent consensus”, the concept put forth by Bitcoin Unlimited, which removed the cap and expected miners to self-regulate in order to reduce orphan risk, as the game theory sounded solid on the surface. Unfortunately, I was wrong and after quite a few discussions with various smart people here, realized that the risks weren’t as straightforward as they appeared and I withdrew my support. 
I do still support a block size increase, however.  The data that I’ve seen suggests that we could go to 4MB base without disenfranchising 90%+ of nodes, and this was a few years ago. 
The biggest issue, IMO, is ensuring that there’s no network split. And the best way to do that is to plan it quite far ahead, potentially 12+ months, even.  But the longer that we wait to get that locked in, the longer it will be until it actually happens.
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:52:39
Not sure what the article means about almost 4MM coins in a single address, but it’s wrong.

The price is up 20% on the 1M and 120% on the 3M and you think we’re in a bear market?
Go look at the corrections that occurred in every other bull run.  It’s incredibly premature to call this a bear market, IMO.

Additional scale for LN due to chain interoperability.
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:36:16
That is true.  A fee market will always(for the sake of network security, hopefully!) arise.  As long as the block space is useful, people will want to use it.

Technology doesn't grow linearly, it grows exponentially.  I'm appreciative of Jeff's research around economic policy and how keeping the existing limit is an economic change, but I still think this is too conservative.
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:55:40
This isn't the right way to go.  Let's look at internet speeds over time, shall we?
In 1995 56k was the norm.  In 2015 we're starting to get 1Gb to our houses(not just businesses), and 20-50Mb connections are commonplace.
That's a 357-893x increase in bandwidth if you're looking at the 20-50Mb number.
Even if we assume just a 3Mb upload speed, that's still a 53x increase in 20 years.
This is less than half of that.
BIP101 may have been a bit too aggressive, but 202 is too conservative.  Is there a middle ground here?
@_date: 2018-08-27 18:58:24
Yep. This is pretty much pointless.

You’re correct. It’s not a matter of “if” we increase the blocksize, it’s “when and how much”?
I think that most people agree that BCH is moving far too quickly, but I also think a lot of people would agree that BTC may be moving too slowly...
I feel like the current division makes it hard to have a nuanced conversation somewhere between “small blockers are idiots” and “big blockers are idiots”.

This is wrong as well as misleading . Slush is nowhere near 65% of the total hashrate. Also, Slush allows its miners to choose whether they want to support BU, SegWit, or no preference. Currently it's 28% don't care, 24% Core(SegWit), 17% Unlimited, 16% no vote, 8% Classic, 4% 8MB, 1% BitPay adaptive algo.

Are you referring to Blockstream?  I wouldn't say they're trying to destroy Bitcoin, just artificially hamper its capacity for the time being.  Still uncool.
@_date: 2016-03-07 17:31:00


Can you explain exactly what you meant to convey by that comment if not condescension, then?


It is true.  Nothing gets merged without Wladimir, and he won't merge anything that's "contentious".


Yes, it is true.  Greg Maxwell, Pieter Wiulle, Matt Corallo, and Luke Jr are all employed by Blockstream.  All against a block size increase.  Coincidence?


I'm not denying that their development work has been top notch, I'm saying that they're incentivized to cripple transactional capacity to further their company's business plan.




Yes they can, it's called nakamoto consensus.


Miners won't run software that the economic majority won't approve of.


So your solution is to blindly trust the Core team?  Can you explain this for me?






If that cross section is any indication I'd say that consensus for Core's roadmap is nowhere near 90%.  But it's hard to get a read on community opinion when it's deleted and blocked from public view all the time, don't you think?


I don't give a shit what the mods want, I want to see open discussion.  Don't you find it ironic that the discussion of uncensorable money is being censored all the time, presumably "for our own good"?




Your cognitive dissonance between the previous and the following statement is absolutely mind boggling.




You're right, he's not.  And yet, he's hosting backroom private meetings with miners where he tries to influence them to only run Core consensus code.  Nothing shady about that, right?
@_date: 2017-02-23 04:04:55

So you're saying that nothing should ever change in bitcoin? We should have a 1MB limit forever?  If that's not what you're saying, then how does that change happen if not by majority hashpower and nodes running code that allows it to happen?  If that is what you're saying....well, I guess we're done here and will never agree, as I can't find any common ground with someone who refuses the system to scale at all, no matter what.
@_date: 2016-03-06 21:10:24

I'm not saying that segwit shouldn't be deployed, I'm saying that 2MB should be done first.

The only ultimatums I see being issued are from theymos.  And again, the only way that XT forks is if the majority wants it.  Seems to me that the minority is the wrong side of the fork to be on, not the other way around.
@_date: 2016-01-11 20:33:46
Peercoin is not bitcoin at all, not sure why you're even bringing that up.  I'm obviously speaking in terms of the bitcoin blockchain here. :/
Majority hashrate is how we've activated every other feature, why is it only bad when talking about a blocksize increase?
And yet, Core's roadmap still doesn't include a block size increase. Any hypotheses as to why that may be?
Yes, XT blocks have a flag in the header.  In all honesty, I prefer Bitpay's median solution with a floating max to BIP101 at this point, but BIP101 served it's purpose I think, to force the blocksize issue to be seriously considered.  At this point, even an increase to 2 or 4MB would at least give us some breathing room.
The frustrating thing is that the Core team refuses to consider a block size increase, and theymos is censoring users and companies that challenge the Core status quo. And then they posture about consensus and then turn around and make changes that even Core devs disagree with(bitcoin.org and Gavin/Jeff) I'm honestly surprised I'm not banned yet as I've been rather vocal recently.  But I'm doing my best to stick to the facts and not get drug down into trolling and insults.

@_date: 2016-03-07 23:21:56
No one wants to prevent these developments, but we don't want the network to be over capacity for months while we wait.
Look at Unlimited and their thinblocks implementation, for instance.
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:48:46
I was speaking somewhat metaphorically, but since you mention it...
Those aren't here now, we need capacity now, and 2MB is pretty low risk.

Much of money's utility is derived from it's ability to be traded for a wide variety of goods, which stems from liquidity, fungibility, and velocity.  If you don't see that $500 transaction fees hamper all of those things, I guess there's no way you and I are ever going to see eye to eye. 
Going to end this exchange here.
@_date: 2016-03-06 19:55:31
Segwit is complicated.  It forked the other day on testnet unexpectedly. We should not rush this!
EDIT: I see that the fork was due to user error, glad to see that.  I do stand by my original statement that it's more complicated than a block size increase, however.
2MB increase is simple.
We need a short term solution now as we've reached capacity.  The path forward seems pretty obvious, don't you think?
@_date: 2016-03-05 02:22:21
A lot of the reason that this service is so popular is that has been paid 5 figures by an unidentified party to DDoS only Classic nodes.  He's been doing it for the last two weeks.  Before all that started Classic had about 1300 nodes with only about 10% hosted on Amazon.
People want to show their support but they're getting the shit kicked out of their home internet connections for it.  I've been getting hit with huge UDP floods and DNS reflection attacks that last for 20-45 minutes every 1-4 hours almost nonstop.
@_date: 2016-03-17 08:24:32
Yes, yes you do.  What better way to explain and discuss than to reference the code itself?
We've spent far too much time with a select few people in locked rooms all across the world talking about hypothetical this and that and not getting anywhere.
Here's some code that everyone can see and read and test, let evaluate it and then change if needed and run it, or discard it entirely.

Actually, I'm on the bitcoin-dev mailing list and I pay attention on github.  I don't have time for IRC, but I like to catch up on the summaries that someone (can't remember who) posts on reddit of the official Core dev meetings.
2MB is not going to instantly centralize the network, is that really what you think?  Based on what?
@_date: 2016-03-08 01:57:12
Where does this mention bitcoin, exactly?
Nice to see the mods are on top of deleting posts about alternative clients, but stuff that blatantly violates the rules of the sub so far as total irrelevance is still here..
@_date: 2016-03-06 21:07:47
I edited my post, I was unaware that the reason had been determined to be user error.  At the time I was made aware I don't believe we knew why yet, or if we did I hadn't seen it.
Segwit is significantly more complicated than a blocksize increase.  Surely you're not going to argue that point?
Segwit is only going to help once wallets start integrating the new transaction rules.  A 2MB fork should resolve itself quickly as there's no incentive to remain on a minority chain.
@_date: 2016-03-17 08:03:25
Yes, you're missing something.  The header can be validated instantly and requires the same PoW that the block requires.  The 30 seconds only kick in once the header is validated as meeting the PoW requirement.

Gavin Andersen and Jeff Garzik are noobs? Umm...k.
Do you believe that the Core team has some kind of divine right to govern bitcoin development?

@_date: 2016-01-12 04:21:04


Wow, just wow.  The PR that requested to re-add Coinbase had 95+% in favor, and you ignored it stating "this is not a vote". And promptly locked it.  To act like you care at all about the consensus process is a complete and utter joke at this point.


Just when I thought you couldn't possibly stun me any further, you post this. So you want to strongarm them into promising to only follow the theymos and cobra approved CoreCoin else you leave them censored.
The vast majority of us are free thinkers that are here because we don't want the state controlling our money.  Guess what, we don't want you controlling it either, theymos.  You are not the dictator of bitcoin.  We are all satoshi.
@_date: 2016-01-08 21:15:36
It's a PR statement.  Stating "we" without a list of signatories kind of implies that everyone important agrees with it.  Which obviously isn't the case.
It certainly allows me to vote on whether or not I agree with the consensus rules laid out by the Core team's implementation. I don't, and therefore I'm running a different implementation.  If the entire network continues to run Core than it seems that everyone agrees with their vision.  If not, it implies dissent and a desire to go in a different direction.  The economic majority is just as important as the mining majority.
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:46:27
No, we need several someones all doing different things and with different viewpoints and then we can all collaborate to do the best thing for the network.

No, we can't just "get over that". Between the censorship(which admittedly seems a bit better lately), the attempted backroom deals, and the paid DDoS attacks on Classic, there's a lot of people that are rightfully pissed that they're being squelched.
This has become more about "Core/theymos/Blockstream is not the godamned emperor of Bitcoin " than ever before.  We're going to continue to have disagreements about the direction to go, and just acquiescing to Core constantly isn't the answer.  In my eyes(and many others) that is the  centralization risk to Bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:58:23
I don't believe they've agreed to that, can you link me?
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:56:03
Based on their experimentation with XT?
@_date: 2016-03-24 17:29:20
It really is just that simple when you get right down to it.  Devs can create software, but no one has to run it.  Users can change the parameters of their nodes, but that doesn't mean that anyone else has to.  Miners can change their rules, but if the economic majority doesn't agree they're going to come back to what they do agree on. Without users, the miners don't have anything to do and no one will accept their coins.
In the end, it is hard to change the rules, as we've seen.  This is a slow process.  This is not a bad thing, as you said, the system should be resistant to change unless the overwhelming majority want it.
But I stand by my original assertion that this is how the system is supposed to work.  We're having an election every 10 minutes, on average.  It's the most granular democracy to have ever existed.
Classic is not an attack, it's an evolution.  Centralization isn't good for any part of the system, and that includes development.

I'm not being "fed" anything.  Don't insult my intelligence.


Bitcoin Core is whatever Wladimir and a select small group of people say it is.  The majority of those people are employed by a single company.  Surely you see why this is a threat to decentralization?


And yet for the longest time(as I said, better lately but that doesn't change the very recent past), discussion of any node implementation besides Core resulted in either deletion of posts and in some cases, being banned entirely.


What backroom deals has Gavin been involved in, exactly?  Remember HK?  That's Adam's doing.  They intentionally kept Classic devs out claiming it was full.


There are idiots on both sides, no doubt.  Look through my post history and you'll see me calling out idiots on the Core hate bandwagon as well.
@_date: 2016-03-17 08:20:19

At what point would you consider fees high enough to be "over capacity"?
If it costs .5USD to get a confirmation, is that OK? $5? $50? $500?
Where do you draw the line?
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:21:10


Yes, let's question motives.  Can you explain to me exactly what you believe the Classic team has to gain here?  Keep in mind that this is headed by Gavin Andersen, who voluntarily spread around the power that he was left by Satoshi, rather than keeping it to himself and becoming bitcoin's benevolent dictator, which he could have done quite easily.


This isn't really an argument, so I'll respond in kind.  Look at who comprises the Classic team, do you see anyone there that you believe has I'll intentions?


Yep, let's look at the monetary incentives.  They raised $75MM in capital.  How much of that is in time locked bitcoins vs. the amount of equity (stock with expectation of future value) that the founders hold in the company?  You'll notice that when they're asked for information about that they don't respond, and Luke Jr refuses to comment on his status as well.


Gavin did a ton of development in the early years.  Until recently there was no reason to create a competing repository.  Bitcoin Unlimited just released thin blocks, Classic is going to release head first mining, all of these are steps towards on chain scaling.  Other than libsec256 what has the Core team done lately for on chain scaling? Many of the recent large improvements are so that LN will work.  CLTV, RBF, SegWit, etc.


Sure.  The majority of the funds came from VC and angel investors.  Who are going to want a return on their money first and foremost.  That money buys them great influence.  Given the choice between getting a better return with a crippled bitcoin settlement network or an on-chain scaled decentralized network where the fees go to the miners, which do you think they'll choose?


I have, and what I see is something that doesn't exist yet.  Decentralized routing is still a huge unsolved problem, among other things.  Allow the network to scale on its own, and if LN works as well as they say it will, you won't have to cram it down our throats, we'll all use it quite willingly.  Assuming of course that it provides the same security, uncensorability, and fungibility of bitcoin itself, that is.


Kind of ironic that you say this, but it's this subreddit that's doing all this censoring, not At the end of the day, I'm not saying that Blockstream is trying to destroy Bitcoin, but I'm also going to say that placing such blind trust into a for profit company that is heavily influenced by investor capital is a bit naive.
Let bitcoin scale on chain, and let's keep trying to come up with other solutions too!

Lite clients are making that assumption today, I'm not sure how this is any different except that it helps to prevent miners from building on a bad chain.
So you're saying that this is a bad idea because lite clients already have the exact same problem today?  Am I understanding you correctly?

I wish you'd stop saying that 1MB is too large already.  Just because you can't run a full node on an internet connection in the bottom 5% of upload speed doesn't mean 1MB is too large.

Not sure what you mean by that.
@_date: 2016-01-10 22:34:49
Sure, but that just means that they weren't consuming bandwidth for the few days prior, therefore reducing total network load a bit.
@_date: 2016-01-09 09:50:20

No one is claiming it's a bad idea.  Just that it's a less effective scaling solution as compared to a block size increase.
EDIT: love that I'm already getting down voted.

That's completely untrue. 75%, &gt;Mar1, 4wk grace period.

Mining on unvalidated blocks happens all the time.  And Greg knows that.
@_date: 2016-01-09 22:56:02
That's a good point and one I hadn't considered.  Is there a flag to set minimum block height offset to relay?  This may be a node type I hadn't considered...close to real time vs archival.
Time to go do some math and possibly revise my viewpoint.
@_date: 2016-01-11 14:47:10
You're moving the goalposts.  Also, theymos would consider them to be mining an altcoin.  Do you agree?

What does bitcoin solve here? Private company charging fees for their services?
@_date: 2016-01-11 08:16:12
Well, you'd have two weeks from the activation before the 1st &gt;1MB block could be mined.
So you'd have time to upgrade.
Second, you're using an SPV wallet so you're trusting someone else to validate the blockchain for you anyway unless you're running your own electrum node.
@_date: 2016-03-07 23:19:52
Limiting liquidity in that way sounds like a slippery slope... How would that impact mixing services, for instance? Liquidity is already somewhat low now due to the limited pool of users, limiting it further could be detrimental to adoption.
I could see charging a sliding scale fee per KB if the inputs are &lt;=N blocks old.  Wallets would need to be aware of this new policy and miners would have to play along, however.  That could get tricky to implement as a standard.
@_date: 2016-03-17 23:43:47
No, that would be up to this sender, OP is the receiver.
@_date: 2016-03-24 00:16:04
I disagree.  Here's why.  From the white paper:


the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of
ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we
proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions
that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes
control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes
work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are
not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can
leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what
happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.
The last sentence is the most important.  Rules and incentives can be enforced with the longest PoW chain.
@_date: 2016-01-08 20:47:28
This is why Core should not be recommended as a wallet to newbies.  It's a reference for developers, not an end user facing product.  Let users be users and use an SPV wallet.
How's that for a non-contentious change to bitcoin.org?
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:52:03
A well thought out and insightful criticism, indeed. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 07:49:57

Yes, I make regular deposits to my savings, don't you?
The point you're missing is that my savings is denominated in the same currency as my checking account. One of the properties of money is the ability to trade it for goods and services, not just the ability to hoard it. In order for that to be possible, you need network effect (everyone uses it). To have network effect you need capacity.

How do you feel about UASFs?
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:08:59
I don't want to see this turn into "everyone abandon Core for Classic".  What we need is decentralization in all aspects of bitcoin.  Multiple implementations are a good thing, no one group should control bitcoin, no matter how democratic the consensus process within that group appears.
Core has done a TON for bitcoin, don't forget that. The more smart people working on the project, the better?
@_date: 2016-01-11 18:52:25
Not sure why you think that when a large number of the major bitcoin companies have voiced their support for a block size increase.  If the mining majority upgraded you'd just sit back and stay in the minority fork?
That doesn't refute what I said, you're still running an SPV wallet and trusting someone else to audit the blockchain, right?
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:41:42
Until we come up with a solution to Sybil attacks for nodes, UASF is non-viable. 
How do you come up with a solution for malicious developers blocking upgrades?  Many would posit that's what's been happening for years with a simple block size increase...
@_date: 2017-02-20 15:54:31
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:41:47
I should have been more careful with my wording, it makes it more likely that the minority chain will continue to live since it can easily be traded as an altcoin at that point. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:12:47
Re-read what he said. Majority BU fork, not minority. Your logic is circular....
@_date: 2016-01-09 06:13:16
THIS, so much this.
@_date: 2016-01-11 14:32:30
Pretty sure all the big miners signed off on 8MB, then 2MB as well.
Yet the Core roadmap contains no block size increase and other Core devs(Luke) are saying that even 1MB is too much.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:58:38
What would it take for you to consider BU bitcoin?  Just curious as to where that line in the sand is for you. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 06:27:59
Or, many users simply disagree with the Core implementation dev team.
Ever heard of Occam's Razor?
@_date: 2016-01-10 22:45:24
This.  BIP101 only activates if the majority wants it.  CORE IS NOT THE DICTATOR OF BITCOIN. I don't know how else to say it.
This censorship is getting out of hand.  Theymos, what gives you the right to decide what is and isn't bitcoin? Do you believe in majority consensus or not?
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:42:32
So you don't think that replay protection encourages the split to persist?
Except now we're talking about UASF and a forced flag day.   
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:35:00
And how do you feel about UASFs?
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:40:44
1) So your position is to never increase block size, that we should never hard fork under any circumstances?
That's why you set a consensus threshold before the fork activates, if someone still refuses to upgrade after the majority has signified that they have, then I'm not sure what they expect to happen.  You can't let a minority hold back the entire network.
2) Who did you trust to get your current consensus rules?
As to 3, there's lots of things that have never been done, just because that's true doesn't make it a good argument against.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:53:25
Sorry, I've seen multiple people here talking about chain splits being a bad idea since it doubles the coin supply(just corrected one of them earlier today, actually), didn't realize you weren't one of them. 
I think the N prisoners dilemma is a better example:  
See the last section with the farmers and the cows to see what best fits bitcoin, in my opinion. 
I don't care what we use as the example for transactional currency as it's irrelevant to my point, although I'd argue against the concept of intrinsic value for gold. I believe the term you want is historic value. See here if you're interested in understanding my position on that: 
Look up Metcalf's law, it explains pretty succinctly why a network is more valuable when it can make more connections between more individuals. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:02:05
So the new talking point is doubling the money supply, eh?  You're aware that 16.277M coins have been mined, right?  So each UTXO exists on both chains, the same PKs own both sets, not sure why you consider that a doubling. Of course, there are 4.3M coins left to mine, and as of the split there will be two 12.5BTC bock rewards assuming it's persistent and the minority chain doesn't die. So I guess you could make the case that there's an increase of 4.3M coins(so 20.4% increase, not 100%) although one is obviously an altcoin, there's aren't two bitcoins. I don't think this is a good argument at all. 
This is one of the myriad of reasons why you don't want a persistent chain split.  Based on how bitcoin is designed, I don't expect that to happen, but I might find myself surprised. Adding replay protection makes that more likely, not less. 
I asked what was dangerous about a HF to 2MB, which was on the table a while ago. BU sprouted due to Core refusing to compromise. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 00:38:57
If we assume 20 new nodes per day(which is high, we're not adding 600 nodes per month), and each one needs to download the 40GB blockchain, that's (600* *40)/5500 which comes out to an extra 4.36GB/mo.  If we assume a year of completely full 4MB blocks that number becomes 27GB/mo per node.  Of course, if we add 600* *12 nodes over the course of a year we're now at 12700 nodes, which reduces the requirement per node to 11.81GB, which isn't unfeasible, I don't think.
My math is admittedly rudimentary, but I think it's accurate.  I'm working on my phone, so hopefully I didn't screw it up if someone wants to double check me.
Seems to me that getting rid of bootstrap.dat is going to add to centralization pressure since now existing nodes are fully responsible for bringing new ones up to date, increasing upload bandwidth requirements.  Isn't this a supposedly major concern of the Core team?
EDIT: reddit formatting is making my post look oddly emphasized lol
@_date: 2016-01-11 07:48:42
That's how the system was designed. Mining consensus.  Things got a bit complicated with ASICs and pooled mining, and miners must consider if the economic majority will follow or not...but this is the system working as designed.  How else could it work?

This. 
To the OP, I'd also like to point out that this sub just uses heavy handed moderation to control the narrative, so what's your point exactly?

Not to mention the ETF denial happened, too. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:59:21
A PoW change, really?  So you want to take billions of dollars of people's hard earned value and remove the fact that it's protected by the largest and most secure network because your preferred "scaling" solution isn't being accepted?
But a hard fork to increase the block size is way too dangerous, right?  The cognitive dissonance required to reach this conclusion is mind boggling...
A PoW change would destroy bitcoin at this point, you should have done this 5 years ago when ASICs were just becoming a thing, not just because you're being disagreed with now. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 20:36:32
Luke has done a lot of work on bitcoin and related projects, it's not fair to dismiss him like that, even if I don't always agree with what he does.
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:41:36
If their response is to throw a tantrum and leave the project because the network had the audacity to make a single change that they didn't create, then I say good riddance.  I'd hate to lose that much talent, they've done a lot of fantastic things for bitcoin and I have the utmost respect for that.  But taking their ball and going home because they don't get to be the dictators of bitcoin?
Don't let the door hit you.
I doubt that will happen, though.  I suspect that they'll merge the change into Core and things will keep on going, only now we'll have two implementations, both with solid Dev teams working together to advance the protocol.  Seems like a win/win to me!
@_date: 2016-01-13 07:18:22
I can't believe I'm even replying to this, but here we go anyway.
Dogecoin was never intended as a patch to Bitcoin.
Dogecoin uses a different PoW.
Dogecoin has no coin cap.
Dogecoin has a different block time.
Dogecoin has a different difficulty retarget algorithm.
Dogecoin has a different inflation schedule.
Dogecoin did not begin on top of the existing Bitcoin blockchain.
Need I go on?
So the answer, obviously, is no.  But you already know that, you're just trying (and failing miserably) to justify Classic as an altcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-23 21:34:33
The fork only happens with majority hashrate.  Majority hashrate = nakamoto consensus.  Therefore it is the "real" chain, as you put it.  Not sure why you consider that an attack.

So theymos started a forum and was given a subreddit, therefore he should dictate all communication related to bitcoin because he's proven to be an expert at it?
And Core should dictate bitcoin development because they're experts at that?
Am I understanding you correctly?
Should the Fed control bitcoin monetary policy since they're obviously such experts at that?
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:33:20
This was already attempted before the halving, and failed miserably.
@_date: 2016-01-08 21:09:36
I'm not in charge to dictate a "line", I'm just saying that dismissing Luke as inconsequential to the project is a bit foolish.
I have no idea who you are, and no I don't think that making a comment on a BIP one time qualifies you as a core dev.  So I guess the line is somewhere between "responsible for the majority of commits to the Core repo" and "made a comment on a BIP that one time".

You would likely recognize me from BTCTalk if you hang out in the Computer Hardware trading forum. 
But there is something magical about the 21M limit(you yourself were arguing about doubling the coin supply earlier, would still like to hear your thoughts on my edit) economically speaking.  Everyone has been operating under the assumption that this is it, and that the level of scarcity is fixed and immutable. Block size doesn't affect economics other than miner fees. 
I'd argue that eventually miners have to transition to fees only as their revenue source quite soon, so they'll be incentivized to keep block size in check in order to ensure that they continue to receive fee revenue. 
You could then argue that dishonest miners(say a state actor) would then just process low/no fee transactions in order to drive honest miners out of business, but then I'd say that the system doesn't work if the majority of miners are dishonest anyway, we know that. 
How useful would Facebook be if you could only have a few hundred thousand daily users?  How about the USD if you could only do 300k transactions a day?  I'm glad that you feel that the capacity is "enough", but there's obviously a not insignificant number of people that disagree with you. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 02:41:57
You failed to address several of my cointerpoints, Blockstream investors' motivations, time locked bitcoins vs. Blockstream equity stakes, and bitcointalk censorship, or Core's lack of on-chain scaling solutions in favor of Blockstream's agenda.  What do you have to say about those?
If you look at transaction trends we're going to be completely out of space in the next couple months.  When performing capacity upgrades do you model based on expected usage by extrapolation of current trends, or wait until you run out of capacity before you do anything?
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:39:16

And most home users aren't miners.  You did say fair use on most ISPs, right?  I'm assuming you were referring to home users here, not large mining operations.
Most miners are SPV mining anyway, and are getting blocks through the relay network.  This argument isn't really relevant. Especially with things like thin/weak blocks and IBLTs on the horizon.
Maybe you should limit your node"s connection count if you're running into bandwidth constraints.  If you're pushing blocks to 30+ peers, that's likely the reason for the excessive usage.  I run a node and don't see that amount of traffic.  Before you ask, yes it's properly port forwarded and isn't just a leech.  I like that you immediately jumped to accusing me of being a non-participatory moron, though.  Thanks for that.

Annnnnnnd that's why we're here. We could have done a 2MB hardfork years ago and this debate would have died down significantly.  Instead Core kept insisting that the hastily added 1MB is the magic # and must be adhered to at all costs, because even the slightest increase would destroy decentralization.  Well, it was the magic number, now approximately 1.7MB including witness data is.
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:01:47

The other point would be N prisoners vs 2 prisoners dilemma. 
But it does require a higher number of transactions, if you're limited to 300K transactions a day, and you have 300M users, each user can only individually transact with another user on chain once every 100 days.  And that's only 4% of the population of the world.

I've been in the space since 2011, I'm not anywhere near new. Nice ad hominem attack though.
So what you're saying is that the 1MB that Satoshi added as a relatively quick afterthought to prevent a DoS attack on the fledgling network just happened to be the magic number for decentralization nearly 7 years later?
By the way, I edited my post to expand on your comment about the doubling of the coin supply, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts. 
Without the payment network and a network effect bitcoin isn't useful, and therefore no longer works as a store of value. See Metcalf's law.  If bitcoin doesn't scale other altcoins will, and money isn't useful if no one uses it...

What do you think mining is if not majority consensus?
Mike Hearn disagrees with RBF and segwit as a soft fork, do you now think that both of those features should not be included in Core? Or is he not important enough to be considered?
If not, it seems to me that what you really believe is that certain things should or shouldn't be done based on certain people agreeing or not, not just anyone who is in contention with the changes.  Individual sovereignty, but some are more equal than others, is what you really mean.
@_date: 2016-01-13 07:43:17
You realize that 75% can do other things as well and the rest of the network can either choose to follow or not, right?
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:01:50
I'm not sure how to even respond to this. So you're not against a hard fork as long as it keeps Core in control?
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:11:11
Exactly this.
@_date: 2016-01-11 08:53:10
So you selectively decide what does and doesn't require whatever you decide consensus is?
Is RBF not overriding the way that things have worked since the beginning, namely first seen first confirmed? Why does that not require consensus but a block size increase does?
For the record, I agree with RBF since first seen isn't guaranteed and could potentially be done anyway by a minority of miners as a service for hire that's just not a guarantee.  But I'm curious as to your rationale.
Separate question, how do you expect the community to arrive at consensus when you censor discussion of things that you consider contentious?

Bitclub just mined a BU block too, it appears. The trend is towards EC, not SegWit. Once we've done this I don't have a problem with activating SegWit, but this has become about governance as much as it is about protocol. We won't be held hostage. I appreciate everything the Core team has done, but i(and a whole lot of others) believe they're wrong to artificially constrain on chain capacity.

My vote is for not censoring a company that's done nothing but good(if you disagree, please cite examples) in this space when it comes to making bitcoin available to the masses.
My vote is to not have companies and individuals threatened with blacklisting from the major discussion forums for daring to experiment with something that the forum moderator personally disagrees with.
My vote is to not have a small team or worse yet, an individual deciding the consensus rules on my behalf and telling me that I'm not using bitcoin unless I agree with them.
My vote is for freedom of choice and for majority consensus.
Your vote is apparently for a centralized entity deciding who is and isn't a good actor and what is and isn't bitcoin and using platforms under the control of said entity to force those decisions on others.

No, when we need it isn't when we hit it, you're right.  In your estimation, when do we need it?  If fees to get into the next block hit .5USD? 5USD? 50?
Is it mempool size? 
If we have &gt;N transactions paying a priority fee?
If we get more than 50 posts a day in trying to figure out how to get their transaction through?
What is your criteria for "need"?
Also, you assume that satoshi is alive, able to post, weigh in, etc.  That may not be the case.  And even if he/she/they do, are you going to change your mind? If someone who is provably satoshi says "increase the blocksize to N" are you going to blindly follow?  If not, why? Because you want evidence that it's the right path, right? So if that's the case, why not look for the evidence now?

Yeah, 3 months after the limit was created.  Way before we needed it.  Saying "satoshi said not to do this" as a rebuttal is pointless without the rest of the qualifying statement, saying "satoshi said not to do this until we need to", is a lot more accurate.
Not that I think that an argument from authority is a good idea to start with, the whole point of the original statement was that it was never intended to be a magic immutable constant.
When we have a 50MB mempool and transaction fees up by an order of magnitude and we're creating a shitty UX, which is likely to stifle adoption at a point that's arguably relatively early in bitcoin's lifetime, I'd say we need it.  What exactly is the point that the article seeks to point out.

You don't seem to understand how a transaction works.  SegWit does nothing for bandwidth usage.  It just moves the signature (the witness data) of a transaction into a separate data structure. Miners still need this data, it doesn't go away. If you're unwilling to learn the basics of how bitcoin works, there's nothing that I can do about that.  If you're unwilling to learn, you should probably shy away from supporting various development efforts as all you're doing is misinforming people.
The main point of SegWit is to fix malleability(there are other benefits as well, but I don't think that detailing them is beneficial when you aren't willing to understand the basic structure of bitcoin to begin with).  It's also a capacity increase as a soft fork, instead of a hard fork.  A hard fork to 2MB without SegWit would use slightly(very slightly, I should stress) less bandwidth than SegWit and provide similar transactional capacity.  What it wouldn't do is fix malleability.  Both will use approximately the same amount of bandwidth.
You don't understand what it is that you're supporting, or why.  I'm going to stop responding now, as I've explained it 3 times and you still don't get it, nor do you seem willing to look at any reference material that would help to clear up your misconceptions.

This is untrue.  SegWit transactions are actually just slightly(usually &lt;=1%) larger.  SegWit just splits the signature(the part of the transaction that proves that you own the coins being spent) into a new and different data structure, allowing more transactions to fit into the original space that used to contain transaction details + signature.  Slightly more data is transferred for the same number of SegWit transactions as today's transactions.


This is true.  Changing hashing operations from quadratic to linear is a big win as well.

Honestly, if you have to ask about such simple stuff as how to calculate power usage and didn't take the halving into account, you're probably not anywhere near ready to deal with a 25kw mining operation.  You'll need to have 25+kw of PSUs, and the necessary electrical and cooling infrastructure to support it.  25kw is more current draw than the vast majority of homes in the USA can provide total, much less to a single location within the structure.

@_date: 2017-01-09 19:29:26


No, you're not.  This is not decreasing the size of the spend script or the signature, it's simply moving the signature outside of the block structure that we use today into a secondary one.
If you have one car that holds two 100lb bags, and you buy a second car and then split the two 100 lb bags into four 50lb bags and then put two bags in each car did you move 100 or 200 lbs of luggage?  The data size is the same(actually at least 3 bytes larger per transaction due to the witness serialization and count per input), it's just been relocated.


If there's a problem?


Segwit contains a centrally planned 75% fee discount on witness data, effectively reducing miner income for doing the same or more work.

You're spreading misinformation, and appear poorly informed.
It's not a 2MB block for 1MB of data, and in fact will increase the size of many transactions.
It's also impossible to back out due to how it uses anyone can spend outputs as a hack to make it backwards compatible with older nodes.
It's also vulnerable to miners spending those outputs to disrupt un-upgraded nodes.
There are benefits, I don't want to sound as though that's not the case, but there are several valid concerns that are being glossed over.
There's a good reason why it's only sitting at 25% support on the network currently, and they're not entirely political.
Please continue researching.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:19:36

Wow.  I....I have no words.
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:48:32




Correct.  Which is why this data must be available to miners, otherwise they cannot confirm that any transactions are valid as they construct the block.  Once they've created a block, this data must still be available to other miners so that they can confirm that they're building upon a valid block.  If the signatures (witness data) was not included in the block data that a miner receives, then any miner could create transactions giving themselves others bitcoins and you couldn't tell that they did it.


Wrong.  You craft a transaction from a paper wallet the same way as you do a hot wallet, from the network's perspective.  There's no way that you can distinguish a transaction made from a paper(cold) or a hot wallet, either as a miner receiving it, or as someone viewing the blockchain after the fact.


That's generally correct, but not for the reason that you think.  The reason is because you've revealed the private key to the machine that created the transaction, not that you revealed it to the entire network.  The private key is no longer "cold".  When you create a paper wallet you do it on an an offline machine. The key has not had a chance to leak to an internet connected machine.  Once you've imported that key into a machine that can connect to the internet to broadcast the transaction, it's possible that it could be compromised.  Therefore you spend the entire contents secured by the key, and no longer consider it secure for cold storage.


You said that it reduces the amount of data that miners need to transmit, and that you could fit 2MB of data into a 1MB block.  You still seem to be saying that now.  SegWit has several benefits, reduction of network traffic is not one of them.  Period.


Did you bother to read the link I gave you?
@_date: 2017-01-10 07:30:17


You're mistaken.  Simple question, what does a signature on a transaction do?  Why is it important?


I didn't say it doesn't do what it's meant to do, please go re-read.  It segregates the signature data into a separate data structure, yes.  That does not mean that you don't need to transmit it, and it doesn't mean that you can magically fit 2MB of data into a 1MB block.


So you looked at the 75% fee discount on witness data?  Do you believe that I'm entirely wrong?
Paging Both are Core devs and know much more than I about both bitcoin and segwit.  Since argument from authority seems to be the only thing this user believes, can you please confirm that signatures are important to miners and cannot be "hashed by nodes" and still must be transmitted, and that segwit doesn't magically shove 2MB of data into a 1MB block?  My arguments are falling upon deaf ears.

The way that SegWit works as a soft fork is by creating "anyone can spend" outputs. Prior to SegWit, these outputs could be spent by anyone without providing a valid signature. Once SegWit activated, those outputs had a pointer that pointed to the signature(witness) in the witness data structure. If miners were to activate SegWit, then roll the chain back and "undo it" basically, they would be able to steal those outputs.  Or if miners were to falsely signal, then not actually enforce the rules, those outputs could be stolen. 
The further the activation itself and other SegWit transactions are buried in the chain, the more secure they are, just like any other transaction is.
That's what Greg is saying, not that the nodes don't know if SegWit is active or not. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:37:16
I'd probably send in smaller chunks to different newly generated addresses in varying amounts over the course of a few days. 
Like if you had 5 btc to transfer, send .46 to a new address, then .7 to another one, next day send 2btc to a new address, then a few more transactions the following couple days to new and different addresses as well. Until you have your entire balance spread across several new SegWit addresses. It's not perfect by any means, but it helps obfuscate what's going on. If you consolidate every single input you have to one single address in one transaction it's easy to glean your entire coin history. This provides plausible deniability.  Now that SegWit is active in the main wallet as well as beta I assume that Trezor will be generating SegWit change outputs as well now?  Anyone confirm that?
I'm not sure if CoinJoin works with SegWit, can anyone confirm or deny that?

@_date: 2016-12-03 15:05:04


See my other reply to you, I think you're just confused as to how to correlate this to other scenarios, hence why you consider it an attack.


Great, attack me instead of my ideas.

I want to agree with you on this point, but a simple block size increase was negotiated from 20 and scaling yearly, all the way down to one-time 2MB and still rejected by Core.  A lot of people are beginning to feel like they're being held hostage by a small group.  This now seems to be coming to a head, finally.  And I'm afraid what's going to happen is segwit will not reach activation because of it.  And then we stalemate.




It was when we had block space, it didn't matter much.  Now that we're consistently up against the wall, it matters greatly.


I'm interested to hear more about this, can you elaborate?


The problem is reliably identifying Bob and Alice from their inputs alone.  Unless you intend on forcing identity on participants, and that's an entirely different conversation.


I wonder if in the future if there will be a market for transaction consultants that could help you maximize the utility and minimize the fee structure of your business that relies on a blockchain... 
Cut-through is interesting, but seems limited in scope.  Seems useful for non time-sensitive payments since you could establish a wait time to try and find a more efficient structure.

Well...yes and no, I think.  
From a user experience/usability standpoint, it doesn't matter.  Whether my transaction was delayed for 18 hours and I had to RBF it twice and pay a dollar due to transactions that some would consider spam or whether it was due to transactions that were only moving significant value between two parties...it still sucked.  
So far as pruning goes, yes, definitely.




Fair enough, good point.




Right, which is why I don't really see it as being all that useful as a network level metric.  The definition is fuzzy and up to individual interpretation.  You made good points on an individual node level, however.  For example, my node has no default fee minimum for relay, and I allow the mempool to grow up to 4GB.  I've never been over 80k ish transactions so far.  Eventually this may strain my resources as the network grows, however.


I'm honestly not super happy about this, but there's no way to stop it, and at the end of the day, it's their resources being consumed, so I 100% get it.  If they choose to not mine a fee paying transaction, surely someone else will, free market and all. :)

Did you read his rationalizations for it?  He didn't just pick that out of the air.






Interesting ideas, but that sounds very much like central economic planning instead of free market.  I don't understand the rationale behind decreasing the subsidy if the blocks are larger.  Then you just incent miners to create empty blocks and no transactions get processed.  That sounds like an immediate failure to me.
Of course, unless you plan infinite inflation, those rules become less and less effective as the subsidy goes away.


Yep, central planning.  Much like a 1MB limit.


Why do you assume older coins are more meaningful?  I can see how you could create a market where older coins are worth more than newer coins, making accurate exchange rates essentially impossible.  Also, causing fungibility problems.






2. you received money recently and want to send again




Weren't you arguing earlier(apologies if I've mixed you up with someone else) that off chain transactions were essential to scaling?
How does penalizing transactions based on coin age play into that?  Now we need to depend on off chain services to track coin age and create transactions for their users appropriately?  Suddenly we're penalizing successful services for having volume.

I agree, not everyone should have to run a node to use the system for small amounts.  If you're going to be transacting in large amounts you should run a full node so you know you're not being lied to!
Also, if you want full privacy(as much as can be afforded in today's chain, that is).

I actually found a project that does this and it seems to respond pretty quickly(although I have no idea what the underlying hardware looks like). 
Not sure if they have mempool support, though.  I messaged them already to ask.

Did you look at the link I posted?  You're wrong.




We don't do everything on-chain today.  My point was that it was an incredibly low bar and we should strive for better than that.




So you could run a node today with 32MB blocks as long as you were just leeching to validate locally. Run a node in a DC for $10/mo if you want to upload too.  If the best connection that I could personally get was a 56K modem that doesn't mean that the network should stagnate to accommodate me, does it?
CPUs have continued to follow Moore's law pretty closely.  I had a slot A athlon 550 back then, today I have an overclocked 8350(which is about 4-5 years old, I'd like to point out). My CPU today is probably 20x faster, if not more like 50x faster than my old one.  And block validation today at 1MB isn't even a blip for me. So yeah, I could handle a lot more with my 5 year old CPU.
EDIT: I was pretty close with my 50x guess.  
So, CPU is doing pretty well
Let me guess you have a Celeron 300 from 2001, and you're barely keeping up, right? And we should take your ancient machine into account when counting SigOps, right?

You're aware that Gavin voluntarily handed the lead maintainer position over to Wladimir, right?  A very long time before this schism began.
Hearn started XT in order to support Lighthouse.  He finally left bitcoin when it had become abundantly clear that a few people with much influence within Core had no intention of scaling any time soon, unless of course that scaling paved the way for malleability fixes, and thus Lightning.


I'd say that's far from clear and a very subjective statement.

Did you read what I wrote above? When the system is at capacity the right fee is a moving target. 
And I'm glad to hear you're not having issues now, but 12 months ago we could get a 0 fee transaction confirmed with no problem, too.
Where will we be in another year, especially if we see another rapid uptick in adoption?

So what do we do about that?  If it's not programmatically prevented, then it's allowed.




So the cost of all the miners plus the pools plus the bandwidth plus every single node on the system, divided by the number of transactions?

@_date: 2016-12-03 00:37:05
I was afraid that may be the case, the more I wrote the more convoluted it became! :)
Let me try this way, blocks have a capacity of 2 TXNs.
Blocks come every 10 mins on average.
TXN generation rate is 1 every 5 mins.
One TXN with a fee of 1, one with a fee of 2, every 10 mins.
No blocks for 30 mins, and we have 6 txns in mempool, 3 at 1btc, 3 at 2btc.
Block found, there's three TXNs with a fee of 2, but only room for two of them in the block.  In this case there's three TXNs with an appropriate high fee, but only two can confirm.  Third transaction is left out, even though it paid the appropriate fee.
Extrapolate from there, and there's the problem with an escalating fee market.  The fee goes infinitely high until the utility of the network no longer outweighs the cost.  Now my argument is, fee paying transactions are not spam, so the issue we have is one of capacity.  Calling it a spam attack is disguising the true source of the problem.
Does that make my viewpoint clearer? 
@_date: 2016-12-03 01:42:57


You did tell me that you were unable to follow.  So I simplified further.  I never called you simple-minded, and actually went out of my way a bit to try and not appear as though I thought you were.


Yes, that's exactly what I said.  The fee goes infinitely high until the utility of the network no longer outweighs the cost of the fee.  Are you sure you understood my point?
So you don't see a usability issue with transactions constantly getting priced out at this early stage of the adoption curve and waving it away as a spam problem, not capacity?  Communication networks are more valuable when they have more users, and there's an awful lot of competition out there these days...

Go look at who signed it and tell me they weren't negotiating on Core's behalf.  The whole reason Blockstream pulled that together was to stop the traction that Classic was getting in the first place and maintain Core's dominant position as the reference client.  I certainly didn't see other Core contributors denouncing it at the time.

It will estimate it based on current network condition.  Not a guarantee, by any means.

Paid .0000004/byte, which according to 21 should confirm in &lt;10 blocks and it took 120.


You're comparing a transaction from two weeks ago to fees from 5 seconds ago, apples and oranges.  What did fees look like then?


This is not quite as old, but I'll bite.  Paid .0000005/byte, should be 8 blocks max, actually 120ish.


You're right, that is the great thing about bitcoin.
Transaction fees are at best an estimate, not exact by any means, and it's leading to poor user experience because it's difficult to estimate what new transactions will come in, when we'll have slow blocks, and what transactions will be re-broadcast with higher fees as you're awaiting confirmation.  This is a capacity problem this early on, not a spam one.  I keep repeating this.

I mentioned something commonly seen on the front page around here, you called me a liar.
I provided links to said threads, you said there were no TXIDs.
I finally copied the TXIDs from the threads I'd linked(which you could have easily done yourself), and you said there was no problem with them confirming in 12x the number of blocks estimated by the 21 fee calc, and that the only fee that matters is the max one(disregarding the rest of the table and only comparing the fee paid to the fee required to get into the very next block).  And applied the same fees to a transaction from two weeks ago, like that's even slightly relevant.
I called you a twat because you were being one.  Intentionally ignoring the information in front of you and claiming it wasn't there.  Then when you had the links directly in front of you, you misinterpreted the fee graph and tell me I can't fucking multiply.

No, I definitely want to see discussion.  But I'm tired of seeing this problem dismissed as "just spam, nothing to see here".  That limits discussion by cutting off what I see as the only logical solution, capacity increases.  Because why increase capacity if it's all just spam, right?
Unless you intend to censor the transactions in some way.  And I don't like that either, fuzzy logic about what fee paying transactions are "legit" and which are "spam" and limiting them as such basically ruins the system.

TCP/IP is negotiated peer to peer for individual links.  In order to scale the internet we have heavy centralization in the form of things like trusted CAs for SSL negotiation and BGP for core internet routers.

I don't believe that's clear at all.  The CSW stuff happened a long time after Core had ceased to pay any attention to Gavin, but you know that already.




Hearn had mentioned that Linux benefitted from that model with Linus, but I dont think he wanted to be BDFL.  Can you cite that?




Solid debate skills here.




Actually, segwit removes the ability for users to validate transactions by marking them as anyone can spend.  Unless of course, you upgrade your node.  So I'm not sure how that's any different than a hard fork.  How exactly does BU do this?
By large miners knocking small miners out do you mean by creating large blocks that it takes too long for them to download?  Or verify?  BU made significant progress on block propagation with xThin, my node's bandwidth dropped noticeably, and most of my 80ish peers are actually Core nodes.

@_date: 2016-12-03 06:11:21
But at the end of the day, only one of those use cases warrant censorship of the transactions each group considers spam.  The miners have one job, ordering transactions, and if you're not paying enough to get their attention, you'll never make it into a crowded block.
And at that point, it's not censorship, it's just economics and the fee market at work, and the fee market is the spam filter.
So if we can't censor them, we have to accept them, and if we have to accept them, we have to have the capacity to do so, else the system fails actual users.
Now what?

17% per year gets us to about 9MB in 2030.  That seems reasonable to you?
In 13 years we'll barely be able to handle the transactional needs of a town of a few hundred thousand people on-chain.
In the last 13 years I've personally gone from a 3Mb down 512k up DSL connection to 300Mb down 50Mb up connection.  While that's above average, we can't possibly hamstring the entire system so that anyone can continue to run a full node on their raspberry pi and ISDN line.
Tripled in the last 3 years.  And the US is behind the rest of the world.
Anyone that can use Netflix can probably run a node at 8MB or more right now.


Right, penalize miners financially by forcing them to operate at a higher difficulty target than their peers in order to request more capacity.  That makes perfect sense. Maybe we should also charge nodes a fee for requesting blocks from other nodes, too.  You know, to disincentivize unneeded bandwidth usage.
Sorry, but BIP103 and BIP105 weren't really compromises at all.  They were hard forking changes for very little benefit.  103 would have been adequate if it started somewhere other than 1MB, but 170KB in the first year obviously wasn't enough.  Not to mention that activation was set 1.5 years in the future.  It's no wonder that neither proposal gained any support.


You mean to about 1.7MB effective based on what we could do today with a simple block size increase, but actually more due to the extra overhead involved?  Right...


Glad to hear that's finally happening.  Can you link me to the repo?
   
@_date: 2017-01-27 03:06:34
This is a joke.  Decreasing the block size limit to 300KB first, then only reaching the current 1MB limit 7 years later?  Wtf Luke.

So in order for someone to make two transactions a day that each take all day to confirm, that's $730/yr miner fees.
That would require 1% of their pre-tax income at $73000USD per year, which according to this, is higher than the per capita pre-tax income of 220 out of 229 countries in the world as of last year.  Source: 
So for 99.88% of the world population they should pay at least 1% (and in the case of the 3rd world, more like 5-10%) of their pre-tax income as miner fees in order to transact twice a day on the bitcoin network, and that seems like an acceptable goal to you?
Total population of the world, 7400million, total population of the 9 countries at or above the median per capita pre-tax income needed to spend &lt;= 1% of said income on miner fees = 9.317million.
If that's the case, we're so far out of alignment on our goals and consideration of acceptable performance parameters for bitcoin that I don't think we're even in the same galactic quadrant, much less the same ballpark.   
@_date: 2016-11-29 08:48:25

I think the best way to incentivize nodes would be to pay the node you broadcast to a node fee as well as the miner fee.  Then you don't have to worry about a Sybil attack, as you would be choosing the node(s) in your peer group to broadcast the transaction to. 
That would require you to know something about the node(s) you broadcast through, however.  Otherwise there's still a Sybil vector.
What would probably end up happening though, is you'd have a few free nodes that everyone would end up using(which would almost certainly be run by spying governments), undermining the privacy of the network.
Speaking of, I should probably fire up a node on Tor.

Some context here:
Most transactions are about 250bytes, so just under 2 cents at current exchange rate.
2 cents to get your 250byte transaction confirmed instead of 11.5cents at current fee recommended by 21 fee calc. 
So people are bitching because they're providing an 83% fee discount to 100 users an hour.
What do you want to bet they did it because people were taking up the slots by sending 0fee transactions to themselves, therefore preventing the service from being used by others?  
Good job trying to make ViaBTC look bad, though.  
@_date: 2016-12-03 15:02:08






This isn't a good example either, this is the system being used as intended, to process transactions.  You cannot filter these transactions without destroying the fungibility and permissionless nature of the system, so why waste your time trying?


It's quite relevant.  That's my whole point!




Bad example again.  You're likening the fee to the AWS instances you bought, and it's actually to the purchase you make from my store!  After all, the reason my store exists is to sell things.  If you purchased a million items from me, and I can't fulfill a million orders, does that mean you did something bad?  Or does that mean that I need to scale up my business to meet demand?  If I don't, someone else will.  That's free market at work!


Now that we've established where the proper fee analogy lies, explain to me why buying things from my store designed to allow people to buy things is an attack.




Intentions don't matter, computers don't care about why you did something.

Are you seriously this fucking dense?  Open each thread, and click the link to the block explorer.  I think one just had the TXID in plain text and you'll have to copy/paste it yourself.
Not hard.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:58:04
Let's perform a thought exercise here, let's say each block can contain 10 transactions.
For our purposes we're going to ignore fee per byte to make this easier and just assume all transactions are the exact same size.
We receive transactions at a rate of 1 per minute, so assuming normal block distribution, everyone gets in, regardless of fee, right?  Mempool is totally cleared with each block, and all is good.
Let's assume one is 0, one is 1btc, one is 2, and so on all the way up to 9btc for the highest fee paid.  10 total.
Now let's assume we don't find a block for 30 mins.  So now the mempool has 30 TXNs in it.  The only transactions that will make it in are the 3 paying 9, the 3 paying 8, the 3 paying 70, and one paying 6(which one paying 6? who knows?).  Keep in mind that when the transactions were made these were all perfectly reasonable fees.
Now we find another block 10 mins later, and we include the new 9, the new 8, the new 7, the two old 6s plus a new 6, the 3 old 5s plus one new 5, and one 4(which one?  who knows).
Eventually the backlog will be cleared, but when you have periods of slow blocks(and I know that sometimes you'll have periods of faster ones, too, but we can never get ahead, only to mempool 0) the network gets behind.  And even though it averages out, during the slow times its painful, even though the average capacity of the system is not being exceeded over a longer timeline.
Now increase that rate to 1.1TXNs/min and we'll never catch up.  You're constantly trying to RBF your way to the front, but it's a moving target.
I'm not saying that fees aren't currently reasonable on average, but sometimes you're fighting a losing battle during the slow times. And this is only going to escalate as adoption continues, until it stagnates and balances with fee pressure.
Do you see how this escalation scenario is going to cause some transactions that were made with a perfectly reasonable fee at the time of transmission to go unconfirmed for much longer than originally expected?     
@_date: 2016-12-03 15:24:35






I basically feel the same way.  I'd like to see flexible transactions get more review before it's dismissed as non-viable as compared to SegWit.
I do think there's some possibility for a conflict of interest between Blockstream and on-chain scaling, but the decentralization concerns cited certainly aren't entirely unfounded when it comes to block size increases.  We just disagree on the severity of them vs the immediate need for scaling.

This is no different than orphan blocks today, except that your node would be aware of both chains and be tracking them both to determine which becomes the new tip.
How many confirmations are considered safe today?  It varies based on the amount transacted, right?  You wouldn't accept a 1 block confirmation for your house sold for $300k, right?  On the other hand, 0conf is probably ok for a 12 cent micropayment to read a news article.

So do you think that the current transaction format is ideal?  I don't think "it's hard" is a great argument in a project like this.  Everything about bitcoin is hard.


Bitcoin itself had the OP_RETURN bug that allowed anyone to steal anyone else's coins way back when.  And how many bugs have been fixed in the core bitcoin codebase?  This is the whole reason we peer review, all software has bugs.  Surely everything you've ever written didn't come out perfectly in the first draft...


Transaction extensibility without constant hacks doesn't seem like a benefit to you? They're smaller after sig pruning, as well.

I understand what you're saying, but how would we identify and distinguish them from "real" transactions?  What's the criteria?
Without being able to identify them in a somewhat reliable and consistent way, we're basically just creating a new term without anything to attribute to it.
Had anyone done any research to determine how many transactions had a reasonable fee at time of transmission but ended up unconfirmed for a long period due to fee escalation?

It's actually somewhat ironic that you bring this up as an example.  Spam mail is the only reason that USPS can send regular mail for the price it does and to as many addresses as it does, otherwise regular mail would be so expensive and restricted that no one would use it.  The bulk mail subsidizes the cost for the rest of us and ensures that letter carriers make it everywhere(and reasonably cheaply, too) so that the system actually functions.
If not for bulk mail, USPS would probably only visit certain large businesses with any regularity and you'd have to schedule an appointment for a mail carrier to come to your home and pick up your outgoing mail, and charge you many more dollars than what you pay today for the privilege.
If it costs you $10 to mail a letter and you only had a handful of potential recipients, it wouldn't be all that great of a system, would it?  What other system could we draw a parallel to with this line of thinking?
@_date: 2016-12-05 03:56:42

Fair enough.  I thought you might be confused as to how it worked and thought you had to provide them with more info than that.

Mostly correct, except for how SegWit was activated. UASF was basically about 1200 nodes out of 10000 or so and was not the reason for activation. SegWit was activated due to miners supporting SegWit2x, which was activation of SegWit first via miner activated soft fork, and then a hard fork to a 2MB base block size 6 months later. 
Unfortunately, there was an off by one bug in the code that checked block height and 2x didn’t activate correctly.

Can you elaborate on this?  I know you had an address blacklist that you slipped into Gentoo (and then later removed after community backlash, I believe, correct me if mistaken) that targeted mostly gambling sites like SatoshiDice, but what exactly are you referring to?

@_date: 2016-12-03 00:30:11
Sure, but the definition of spam in bitcoin isn't really relevant.  In order to have a fungible money system you have to treat all fee paying transactions equally.  The fee is the spam filter, if someone was willing to pay enough to get it confirmed, it's not spam.
Therefore, the recent delays must be a capacity issue, not a spam issue.
Unless you believe that 2-hr average confirmation time is a great value for that particular metric, and in that case there's no problem at all.
@_date: 2016-12-03 06:40:40

The system that's described in the white paper "can eventually reach visa level transaction throughput, it never really hits a scale ceiling".  Which we know isn't exactly true based on infrastructure limitations and wishing to maintain the decentralized nature of the system, but we can certainly go higher than we are now.
The change is going from a p2p cash system to a settlement/store of value system with exorbitant fees per interaction.  You have it backwards, in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-12-03 03:49:14
Also agreed.  But where does the state of the fee market become a capacity problem?
I think we can both agree that a capacity of 1 transaction per block would be far too low to be useful, right?  And that the current infrastructure probably won't allow a billion transactions per block either, without grievous centralization concerns.
Where is the happy medium? Are we currently right on top of it?

Perhaps you should read through that thread, then come back.

You didn't explain anything just now, you just saved your hands and basically said "BU does scary stuff".  HOW does BU do this? Please be a bit more specific.




Yes, the concept is called emergent consensus.  I believe that it needs further study, personally.  But everyone shitting all over BU all the time and calling them idiots and malicious actors that want to destroy Bitcoin isn't helping anything at all.  Go read this:

Doesn't this run counter to the "if you don't own your private keys you don't own any bitcoin" philosophy if we're going to force users into off chain services?  I personally hold &lt;1% of my bitcoin in off chain services that I don't directly control the key to.
Also, doesn't this also directly contradict the concept of p2p cash as described in the white paper that many of us signed up for?

Fair enough, I probably shouldn't have taken that jab.

Until there’s a majority of that hashpower on another chain that has the incentive to 51% your minority chain to death as soon as you hard fork to drop the difficulty.

I’m far from a Bitcoin hater, but you way overestimate the power of 13% or so of nodes. Go pull some stats on how many UASF nodes there were at their peak and then get back to me.
Nowhere did I suggest reducing the number of full nodes. I just said that a minority isn’t going to change the system, just as when there was a minority of hashrate(about 30% before 2x) supporting SegWit, it also wasn’t happening. 
Bitmain was one of the largest detractors of SegWit, and it was because it broke covert AsicBoost. But now they have BCH as their next attack, so they finally had to let that one go when the majority of miners broke from them due to 2x. 
Run your node and you’re in charge as long as the majority continues to agree with you.  The majority didn’t agree with UASF. That’s what you see to be missing.

@_date: 2017-11-07 20:00:53
NO, they can’t. They would have to do it with a ton of huge multisig SegWit transactions, are you dense?
And even then, they could only do it with SegWit transactions if they act irrationally and not in their own best interests. They could do that now and create 4MB blocks, are they?  Why not?
If a miner starts doing that there’s nothing stopping the remaining honest miners from simply not extending that chain, also. 
Do you understand how mining works and the incentives behind it?
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:48:52
The paper you’re referring to about 4MB being safe is from about 3 years ago, if I’m thinking of the correct one. Let me know if I’m wrong. 
So miners can be trusted to enforce block size defaults, but they can’t be trusted to not attack the network?  How do those same soft limits not also apply to the 8MB mega block you’re talking about?
Yes, but the blocks limited by the 32MB p2p limit were also back when it was cheap to CPU mine on the tiny network, and cheap to transact since there was very little “real” activity back then.  You haven’t rebutted my point that the network operates under the game theory based assumption that the majority of miners are honest participants, if you throw that out all sorts of things are broken.  I don’t see your attack vector as an issue unless you throw that out as well, and at that point we’re both pissing into the wind arguing about something far less sinister than what’s possible under those circumstances. 
You realize that the attack cost is also in either physical mining equipment and infrastructure to run it, or in renting hashpower, not just in fees, right?  The cost is only fees if you’re not mining the blocks yourself.
Nicehash only has 182PH total available to rent, or about 1.6% of the network. Not really enough to perform the sort of attack you’re talking about with any regularity. And you’d have to pay a premium for it to boot, as it’s an open marketplace.

Trezor is a better hardware wallet than a Ledger.  I always treat crypto as if it’s worth millions, and here’s why.  Right now you may only have a few hundred dollars worth, but in a few years it could be a seriously significant amount. How annoyed are you going to be if you try to retrieve your now tens of thousands of dollars worth of crypto a few years later only to find that it’s been stolen or you lost the wallet?
Hardware wallets ensure that will never happen as long as you store your 24 word seed securely.

I would assume that it would try to build only the failed paths, but I also assume that the most likely reason for failure would be due to channel state changes between initial path discovery and attempted usage. Which may end up as a viscous cycle in the event of a busy network, fail, retry, now another path isn’t usable, repeat.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:34:24
MINING Nodes do that. Non-mining nodes just confirm that the rules they expect to be followed are being followed. If you’re not extending the chain, you’re not deciding jack, you’re just confirming what you’re following.

I’ve never supported BCH.  You have me mistaken for someone else. I supported BU until 2x came along, I’m now running a btc1 node. 
I don’t agree with the political tactics of Core and the censorship in the major communications channels, no. I certainly recognize that they’re an incredibly talented team.  But I feel like they’ve implicitly supported the attempts to manufacture consensus and sow discord around anything that isn’t directly on their personal roadmap.
SegWit was activated because of 2x, 2x came about because of the HK agreement (which was broken). Now it’s time to fulfill the agreement. 
I’d ask you a similar question, do you think that a 2MB base block size is going to irrevocably damage bitcoin?  I think that we need this now because we need to move the fuck on already. The community has been in a civil war for far too long, I’ve been around since 2012 and I’ve never seen such vitriol and hatred spewed forth on both sides as I’ve seen in the last year or two. And it’s just getting worse.   Besides that, a capacity increase to ensure that the L2 solutions have time to finish fleshing out is a good thing, we don’t want to lose our network effect and frustrate so many new users this early on. 
4TB hard drives are cheap, and you don’t need to store the entire blockchain to run a node. Bandwidth keeps increasing, and so does memory. I’m more worried about UTXO bloat than blockchain size, to be frank.  If we can come up with a good way to do UTXO commitments periodically, a new node doesn’t even need to download the full chain to spin up. Now that’s scaling!

I personally believe that 2x is the best way forward, yes. 
But at the end of the day, I don’t give a shit about core or 2x or anything else succeeding. I want to see bitcoin succeed, however that may be. 
I don’t think that 2x is dangerous, and I think that Core is being overly conservative.   I also think that this fork is going to be a clusterfuck because it’s being vehemently opposed on rather flimsy arguments that have evolved over time from “too big, kills small miners and nodes!” to “harms decentralization in a hand wavey way“ and now it’s basically just personal attacks on Jeff Garzik and cries of it being an attack of some kind.  If anything it’s becoming dangerous because it’s pretty obvious that the majority of the hashpower intends to upgrade, and a lot of users are going to be left on a minority chain with massively reduced capacity and security.  Which ironically, will likely then be followed by an emergency hard fork on super short timing to change difficulty and possibly even PoW.  Just lol
I just thought it was funny that you have a strong opinion (enough that you’re running a node and banning peers) on how an incredibly technically complex network like bitcoin should scale when you don’t seem to understand what a rather simple script is doing, that’s all. 
It’s like some guy showing up at a theoretical math conference planning to give a presentation of some kind, and then asking someone “wait, how does the Pythagorean theorem work again?”

Yeah, 51% attacks are a bit scary.  I don’t think you’re properly considering the incentive structure change when there’s two chains each competing for the same PoW, when you say that it’s less profitable that honest mining, but think whatever you like. 
I’m not threatening anyone, I’m just saying that’s a risk you have to consider when you decide not to follow the majority chain, that’s all.  SegWit achieved consensus via NYA, this is just the second part of that. 
Who’s talking about bcash here?
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:16:31
No, you can certainly use the internet without understanding how it works. But your opinion on how we should go about scaling the internet probably isn’t all that valuable.  That was my analogy, you’re quite gung-ho and adamant about expressing your opinion on something you admitted that you don’t understand.  I just find it interesting.  Would you go to a voting booth and cast a vote for or against a bill you hadn’t read?
I also like the idea of a store of value, but if you can’t transact with it without it costing huge fees, that value will evaporate to chains where you can.   It’s a fine line to walk, and we’re close to other scaling solutions, but we need a bandaid for a year or so to give us a bit of breathing room to make sure we don’t lose network effect and adoption momentum. 
Can you explain why 2x is a push for greed?  Not sure I understand where you’re going with that.   What upper hand are businesses trying to get, exactly?  2x’s goal isn’t to become the new reference client and development team. It’s to get a much needed feature activated (SegWit and a minor block size bump) and merged into Core and continue along with building bitcoin!  We finally got SegWit(which wasn’t gaining necessary miner consensus until 2x), which is Core’s contribution, now it’s time to get the minor block size bump and move on. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:44:33
So 1MB was a safe magic number for a while, right now 4MB is that safe magic number, but 8MB is dangerous?  Link to recent data supporting this assertion? 
Satoshi wasn’t worried about miners spamming, he was worried about users spamming. The cost to maintain an attack like that back then was trivial, today it’s not. Still not out of reach of a larger bank or a nation state, however. And likely never will be unless bitcoin displaces fiat. 
Miners can also double spend and do all sorts of other nefarious things. The reason they don’t is the way that the incentives are aligned.  The system only works if you assume the majority of miners are honest.
I never said that it would be a fork at all, unless you consider the usual orphans that happen fairly regularly today a fork, which I guess they are technically. They just resolve rather quickly.

EDIT: I see nothing in that post to support the claim that 75% of Classic nodes are BS. please enlighten me.  I do see that there are more Classic nodes hosted in the cloud than Core, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're bogus and only spun up to inflate the node count.  Also, I'm not sure why that link only shows 700 Classic nodes when there are more than 1000.

Which does nothing to prevent someone from sending you BTC in a RBF transaction.  It's only opt-out for the miners and the node operator.  The entity most impacted (the one actually getting paid) has 0 control over it.

1. Decentralized.  I want to see nodes in every country on Earth.  I don't think that everyone needs to run a node on their phone, but anyone should be able to run it on a midrange PC from the last couple years on an average metro internet connection.  I'd also like to see decentralization in the development process.  One implementation to rule them all is risky and risks corruption.  Ideally mining would turn into 21's vision with billions of devices all running low power mining chips that use minimal power and p2pool.
2. Censorship resistant.  I want to see no blacklisting or redlisting of any kind.
3. No one should be forced to off chain solutions.  Lightning is great, but artificially limiting capacity to make it happen is absolutely unacceptable.  The block chain is for everyone, not just for huge entities to settle up between one another.
EDIT: there's a post in talking about setting up minimum hardware/network specs for various configurations, perhaps that's the road to go down.  8MB blocks with no thin blocks requires X, 1MB blocks with thin blocks requires Y.  And so on.

@_date: 2018-11-25 19:00:43
95% of the hashrate supported it. It didn’t activate because it was “called off”, then the client had an off by one bug in it that caused it to fail to activate based on block height. 
I still don’t think it was a bad idea, we need more on-chain capacity.  I understand wanting to optimize what space we already have with things like signature aggregation, but there are other ideas like bulletproofs that will require even more space for transactions. 
In my opinion, the 1MB limit is the single biggest obstacle to Bitcoin’s global success. But that doesn’t mean that we need GB blocks yet, either. Surely there’s a happy medium somewhere...

This exchange is rapidly becoming completely pointless, I don't know why I keep replying to you.  But here we are.
As a dev I'd expect you to think more in concrete terms rather than waving your hands and making analogies.  I'm all for software optimizations.  But Bitcoin is not like your website.  You can't just roll out a schema change and have it take effect for all users immediately.  The network depends on all users getting the exact same results in lockstep, down to bug for bug compatibility, no exceptions.  You can't just decide one day 3 years in the future that we're gonna deploy a blocksize increase next week.  It takes time, users have to upgrade, a flag day or block height has to be set, etc etc.  Surely you recognize that?  That requires planning.  Planning requires discussion.  Extension blocks might be able to be done as a softfork, but that's a lot more technical debt on top of what we already have.
I'm surprised that a lead software engineer has such a hard time with articulating a basic set of requirements for what constitutes when something is needed, and the metrics to determine how much it's needed.
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:42:07
Yes, I’m familiar with both, but even if we activate Schnorr and all of those transactions are done in 8-10 person factories, you’re still talking about a couple of years worth of transactional capacity, assuming all we use BTC for is opening one channel per person.  And that’s not a reasonable expectation. 
Block size MUST increase, there’s no way around it if we expect to scale up to a global payment network.  And the sooner we get that rolling, the better off we’ll be so far as ensuring everyone is ready by the time it actually happens a couple years later. SegWit got to 45% adoption in just over a year, so I think two to activate a hard fork for an increase is probably reasonable. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:52:52
If you don’t understand why a global distributed ledger that’s intended to replace money as we know it and your gaming PC aren’t the same thing, I can’t help you either.
You are aware that increasing the blocksize limit is a software change, right?  Do you think this affects ASICs or something?
How much additional scale do you think we’re going to get without a blocksize increase?
Also, still didn’t respond to anything else I said, but whatever. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:31:22


Want to expand on that?


SegWit wasn’t active, of course it wasn’t being used...  Transactions most certainly were and are being batched.  How exactly was the network attacked?

That's not an answer to my question, it's just a bunch of other ones that are loosely related.  The question is pretty simple.  When I want to close a channel and use my BTC somewhere that isn't LN, how does a channel factory make that process more efficient?


Simple isn't always your enemy.


And what would that be?


Not at all.  But I think that the more useful that Bitcoin is the more users will run nodes.  I also think that if on-chain fees are astronomical that it will hamper user adoption.  If user adoption stalls, the network becomes less useful.  When the network is less useful, there are less users, and thus less nodes.
It's a bit of a chicken and egg problem, I admit.  Increasing block size increases node requirements, increasing barrier to entry.  But fees are also a barrier to entry that one must consider as well.  I personally was paying fees of up to $100 per transaction just to get funds to exchanges during the last rally.  And the amount of activity we're going to need to handle is a lot more than that in order to get anywhere near global adoption.  Momentum is an easy thing to lose and a very difficult thing to regain once lost...


I don't think that's obvious at all.  Now you're avoiding multiple points of mine.  The first being about LN centralization concerns when on-chain transactions are prohibitively expensive, and the second about WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO INCREASE THE BLOCK SIZE AND BY HOW MUCH?  If we can't even start to have a conversation around parameters/goalposts that make sense, what are we even talking about?  I've been responding to every point you made, if you're going to pick and choose to respond to what you think fits your narrative this conversation is pointless.


You're aware that SegWit actually increased transaction size a wee bit, due to the pointer to the witness data, right?  Not saying that it was the wrong decision, just be consistent in your talking points/areas of concern, please.


SegWit is a third-party malleability fix first and foremost.  The fact that it was able to be softforked in with a new parm (blockweight) that allowed an approximate 1.7x increase in transaction volume was a secondary benefit.


Not per se, but I own a software company and am a pretty technical individual.  A better analogy would be that we run a photo sharing site, and while we're developing the JPG format we run out of room on our server's hard drive.  Do we either:
A. stop accepting new user registrations, or limit our users to posting 1 photo per day each?  Or perhaps we increase the fee that users pay to upload photos, that will surely make them want to use us!
B. buy another fucking hard drive(not 32 of them, that would be silly) and keep working on the JPG format as quickly as possible?
One of these is going to hamper adoption of our product, and the other is not.  But in this case, our infrastructure has a ticking time bomb built right into it.  Our electricity that powers our servers is paid for by users uploading photos(to represent miners, stay with my shitty analogy here) and every 4 years the amount that we have to pay the electric company to keep the server going doubles!  Luckily, the electric company is giving us a break for now, but every 4 years they're cutting our break in half.  Eventually if we don't have enough users when the cost has doubled several times(block subsidy halved) then we won't have enough electricity to keep our server running(blockchain is no longer secure due to lack of miners).  We have a limited time window for this experiment to work, we can't fuck this up!
Now, these are both stupid and incredibly oversimplified analogies that poorly represent incredibly nuanced technical details of a decentralized distributed ledger.  
But my point is that it will take time to ensure that we don't disenfranchise users by forking them off the chain with an increase, or increasing their node requirements beyond their capabilities.  But we should be figuring this out now, not three years down the road.
You seem unwilling to even have the conversation about what is reasonable and when, and seem content to wave your hands and say, "not needed now, fuck off with that noise, look at these enhancements you idiot, we're doing other shit here man, you just don't get it, unicast vs broadcast".  And so on and so on.
Now I'll toss your question back at you...are YOU a software engineer?
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:47:30
No, you made poor analogies and ignored the rest of my reply. Not to sound like an ass, but I’m not going to bother communicating if this is the best you can bring...
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:17:14


What do you see as the problem with increasing base block size by a small and reasonable amount?


Segwit 2x November 16, 2017
Segwit activation August 23, 2017
The reason that SegWit was activated was because of 2x.  Until then SegWit had only managed about 35-40% miner buy-in, and had been stuck there for 6 months or so. Go see what percentage of miners were signaling SegWit prior to 2x.


Spam is subjective.  A transaction that pays a reasonable fee can’t be considered spam, IMO.  Any other stance is a very slippery slope...


So when you can't run a game, you don't change the graphics settings from Ultra, you buy a new graphics card?
My local computer is not a global distributed ledger that depends on adoption to survive beyond the time when the block subsidy decreases to a very small amount.  LN will help, but the capacity of the main chain must be increased for adoption to happen.  
Assuming 7tps, which is about the maximum possible speed as of now, we can perform approximately 220MM transactions per year.  If we assume that every single transaction is opening a LN channel, and we also assume that each adult age 18-65 in the world wants just a single channel, and we assume that they already have bitcoin, and that no one wants to close a channel ever, it will take 20.45 years for those 4.5B people to onboard at current capacity.
And that’s obviously the absolute best case.  The reality is much worse.  They have to get bitcoin, probably would like more than one channel, would like to be able to close and transact on-chain without LN, etc etc
And it takes time to prepare users for a hard fork to ensure we don’t fork or disenfranchise anyone.
Bottom line, the current 1MB limit is not enough.  The problem is balancing decentralization and minimizing entry friction with scale.
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:06:47
Do you understand how channel factories work, or are you just regurgitating some statistics you heard somewhere?  Channel factories become more effective with more persons involved...
Keep in mind that channel factories only help with opening channels, not closing. And that it’s an inherent centralization mechanism, as all participants must coordinate with the original on-chain channel opener.
Schnorr also doesn’t help with there’s not more than one signature to aggregate.  If you only have one input Schnorr won’t change your transaction size appreciably.
Expanding the block size will take time, why do you think that every possible optimization must be done first instead of doing them in parallel?  Where do you draw the line?  What if I have an idea that will save 1% on transaction size but it will take 10 years to implement?  Must it be done as well and adopted before a block size increase?

@_date: 2018-11-27 02:15:01


Persons, peers, nodes, whatever. Semantics. 


Yes.  Can you explain to me how a channel factory improves on the scalability of closing a channel and unlocking the funds from LN?


I didn’t say that you did, but was just trying to point out that the use case isn’t universal.  Additional block space is.  Schnorr also incentivizes reduction of the UTXO set, which is great as well.


I’m well aware of that, but sane people aren’t suggesting going the BCH/SV route and increasing base block size by huge amounts.  We’re talking 2-4MB here.  Which would amount to a maximim effective increase of 4x over what’s possible today.  This is quite doable on the vast majority of internet connections.  Do you think the base block size on LTC is too large?  Because that’s the equivalent of what I’m suggesting...
If it costs hundreds of dollars to open a channel either most normal users will not bother, or they will trust some other party to do it for them.  I want bitcoin to remain trustless, don’t you?


I’m not ignoring that at all.  You just seem to think that 1MB is the perfect magic number, and that it’s sacrilege to consider increasing it until some undefined number of other scaling improvements are implemented, no matter the justification.
I just have two questions for you.
Do you think that 1MB is the exact right number forever?
If not, when and what is a reasonable increase?
You’ve also avoided my other points regarding potential centralization concerns of making the main chain so expensive that LN is your only option to transact.  LN looks great, I’m running a node myself with about .25BTC of capacity(put up or shut up, IMO) but it’s not a magic bullet that makes base layer scaling irrelevant.  We need both. 
Again, why can’t we do both?  What’s wrong with working on using our existing block space more effectively as well as making more of it available in a prudent and reasonable fashion?

SegWit2x is the compromise that got SegWit activated by miners recently. This also includes a plan to hard fork base block size to 2MB soon afterwards. Many large companies in the space and about 96% of miners are supporting it. Core is not, and there's a vocal cabal of users here who take every opportunity possible to demonize it.

This is attempting to force consensus. As noted above, Core already bans peers that serve invalid blocks today. A .13(significantly older than current release tip) Core node would see a block with a &gt; 1MB base block as invalid and ban the node anyway. 
Now they're banning nodes that are for now, consensus compatible. This is a political move, not a technical one. Which is very very fucking bad for what's currently the reference client.

I didn’t say anything about CEOs, you did. If you’re right, this is how bitcoin dies, because overly centralized miners made a bad choice. If the system isn’t anti-fragile enough to withstand this “attack”, then it deserves to die and we’ll build another one.  If you’re wrong, then we scale enough to buy us leeway to finish LN, mast, schnorr, etc and continue to scale even further.  
If you look around here, the majority of the vocal criticism is coming from about 25 users. There’s a lot of us users who are in support of 2x, but we get banned or our comments silently deleted(one of mine was deleted just yesterday, in fact). The only acceptable position here seems to be against 2x.  Being loudest and most visible doesn’t make you the majority. But we don’t have a great way to measure the opinions of millions if users, we have hashpower. 
This sub is attempting to manufacture consensus, and it’s working. 
I’m not saying that 2x has unanimous consensus, far from it. But neither did SegWit, that was the whole point of 2x, a compromise so that we can move on. But even that is being demonized.

So essentially, a few people own the Bitcoin project, and you’re ok with that?  Color me confused as to your outrage as to what you seem to think 2x is doing....
Majority = PoW, the only metric that we have that’s mathematically provable and unable to be sybiled.  This is where the rubber meets the road.  It’s pointless to try and measure consensus here, since you get censored if you don’t agree with Theymos(which is the only reason r/btc exists, and the reason this sub is now just as much a cesspool as that one is). You can’t measure consensus with node count, as it’s easily gamed with cloud providers and the like.
The only other possible way that I could see to do it is by signing votes with coins you control, but then you have the issue of not all the stakeholders actively participating, and who organizes that?  We don’t have a decentralized voting mechanism besides PoW, which I’ve already touched on. 
This is where we find out how anti-fragile bitcoin really is. Either we come out the other side stronger than ever and hopefully finally united as a community, or we remain split.  And divided, we fall. 
2x got us SegWit, it wasn’t going to happen otherwise. The miners have a lot at stake here, they have no incentive to render their expensive single purpose hardware worthless.

@_date: 2017-10-26 05:07:39
You’re correct, the current bitcoin repo is not bitcoin, we agree 100% there. But where we seem to diverge is the metrics required to determine consensus. 
I agree with you to a point, but there’s a reason why every single feature up to this point has been activated by hashpower signaling and not node count.   I find it interesting that hashpower signaling was a great way to activate things until the miners and Core no longer saw 100% eye to eye any longer. Now we’re finding all sorts of other metrics to “measure consensus”. What happened to Nakamoto consensus?  Isn’t that the innovation which the system is built on?  If the system can genuinely be co-opted in this manner to destroy it, then we need to let it die and come up with a better one!  Not protect a broken system from failure by moving the goal posts.   But I don’t think bitcoin is broken, not yet....
I have no business model, and I(and a lot of other people, regardless of what this heavily censored subreddit may try to make you think) believe that 2x is the right path forward, as a reasonable compromise. So you’re wrong there.

For what it's worth, I agree.  Without Gavin we may not be where we are today.  He's not nearly as important today since we have many more developers than we did a few years ago, but that doesn't mean that his contributions should be downplayed.  I also expect more good things to come from him.  I genuinely believe that Gavin's willingness to put some code where his mouth is and his various articles and blog posts on scaling are what jumpstarted the scalability discussions we're having now.  More devs is a good thing!

No, this is a terrible move.  The network needs to remain agnostic for this to work.  It's a very slippery slope to demand mining pools decide what is and isn't spam.  A transaction is a transaction is a transaction as long as it includes an appropriate fee.  This destroys the fungibility of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-03 07:41:39
How is a miner vote any different than allowing miners to set their own blocksize based on the transactions they include like they do today?
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:48:36
Yes, I do. 
You’re looking at a single futures market on Bitfinex, I assume?  I’m not sure that one futures market that’s essentially a token for a blockchain that doesn’t exist yet is sufficient for price discovery.  Not everyone is willing to undertake that sort of counterparty risk, regardless of their feelings one way or another. 
I support 2x but I’m not dumping my current bitcoin holdings for that futures token. 
I’m also not going to sell either side of the fork until a clear winner emerges. I dumped my bcash immediately, for reference. 
If 0.15 hadn’t decided to automatically ban btc1 nodes we could have at least had a better idea of what the network support looks like(some btc1 nodes are masquerading as Core nodes so they’re not partitioned)but again this is a gameable Metric, so I wouldn’t consider it consensus even if 90% of the nodes were btc1.  I also don’t think that btc1 has a majority here, even if every node were reporting true user agent status. 
Why do you think that hashpower signaling has been the metric used to determine consensus for feature activation up until recently?  Speaking of coincidences, isn’t it interesting that it was great until the hashpower didn’t fully agree with the Core roadmap?  Just FYI, Core didn’t support UASF, either. 
Now that we’re having a civil conversation, I’d like to point out that earlier when I said a few developers controlling the Core repo, I was referring to those very few with commit access. Those that had commit access and dissenting opinions (like Gavin) have been removed by others.  I’d also point out that 95% of the PRs come from about 15 contributors, 200+ is the total contributor count over the lifetime of the repo. 
I don’t think that Core is evil, I’m not one of those nutbags that screams about how Greg and Adam are trying to destroy/co-opt bitcoin. But I’m also not buying that Jihan and Roger are trying to do the same thing. 
I do think that we need a better way to measure consensus, and I also think that going forward we may never have overwhelming consensus on anything of real importance ever again, purely due to the number of people involved in the project now. But in the meantime, the only programmatically measurable and Sybil-resistant metric that we have is hashpower. 
And maybe that means that bitcoin is doomed to fail. But if it does, let it fail early and let’s build something better, learning from our mistakes. And this is coming from someone with a significant financial stake in its success. 
I’d feel better if 50%+ of the network was on p2pool, but at least we seem to have much better pool distribution than we used to. And there’s other companies getting into the hardware game, so that’s good to see as well.

You seem to be contradicting yourself with the last line.  So human reasoning is fallible in 101, but not in 100?
The problem with 100 is you expect the miners to act in the best interest of the network instead of their bottom line, and it's been proven that's not going to happen.  At least with 101 the block size isn't tied to anyone's personal profit...

Fund actually haven't left your wallet.  You could rebroadcast the transaction with a higher fee and it may get confirmed more quickly, if your wallet supports that.
Eventually, if your wallet(or the node it depends on in the case of a lite client) sees that the transaction has been evicted from the mempool, then it will see the funds as though the transaction never happened.
We really need to do something about the user experience, you shouldn't have to understand all of this in order to use bitcoin as an average user.  I may make a new thread on just that...

The amount of ignorance in this thread is astounding.  You do realize that there's variance in mining, right?  Hashrate is estimated from the network based on blocks solved, it's not an empirical measurement.

That is only visible in hindsight.  If you believe a block size increase is needed, why wait until you've already driven most new users elsewhere?


I have no idea how SegWit helps with miners later being incentivized in the absence of block subsidies.  If anything, it makes the problem worse due to the discount on witness data.  Please explain.


That was Greg's argument.  Are you saying I misunderstood him?


SigOps are easily handled with a limit for now.  Can you provide any use cases that need more than the limit originally proposed by Classic?
UTXO size is an issue, but increasing the block size by a reasonable amount doesn't really affect that all that much.  We wouldn't be here(Unlimited gaining traction) right now if Core had simply embraced one of the several proposals that have been put forth as compromises.
So you don't want to change it because we don't know what we don't know?  You could make that argument about literally anything.

And yes, there had always been a 32MB limit due to the p2p protocol, but what we're talking about is the 1MB MAX_BLOCKSIZE global constraint.
@_date: 2016-10-20 03:39:07
Which is why we need larger blocks so that we can have more transactions per block.  Block subsidy isn't going to last forever...
@_date: 2016-10-27 04:21:02
Constantly growing backlogs aren't creating a stable fee market, they're creating an escalating one as users fight to be included.  My node has 70k unconfirmed transactions in its mempool right now, the most I've ever seen.
Your argument about mining behavior in the absence of a block reward is interesting, but I don't believe that's something to be concerned about today.  I would argue that currently we need more network effect, which is only going to come from more users, which is only going to come from more capacity.  In 8 years this may be a serious issue to contend with, however.
Your other argument is that we need to artificially restrict capacity in order to drive innovation?  I'm not sure that I agree with that either.  Surely the developers that are smart enough to develop the additional scaling measures we need that are not block size related are smart enough to look past the tip of their own noses and recognize the need without a capacity crisis to force the issue?  This smacks of central planning to me, not at all of emergent consensus.

It's not on the blockchain, it's unconfirmed.  It's in the mempool.  And depending on node configuration, it can get ejected after a certain time or if fees continue to rise.

How does SegWit allow for several orders of magnitude more transaction volume?  At best it's a 1.8x increase, and that's with near 100% adoption, which isn't a reasonable expectation at all based on previous soft fork adoption speed.

Ok, so I'd ask you what makes this any different than a gun show.  They don't run background checks either.
And your argument for believing that liquor stores are OK even though alcohol kills people and causes people to kill other people when driving drunk is, "it's legal, so it's fine" ?
Let's extract legality for a moment and just look at morality.  Market A sells substance A that can be harmful to both the user and others due to the user's actions while under the influence of said substance.  Market B sells substance B that can be harmful to both the user and others due to the user's actions while under the influence of substance B.  Which one of these two markets is SR and which one is your corner liquor or gun store?  What's the difference?  Either outlaw alcohol and tobacco entirely, or legalize other drugs.  Otherwise you're a hypocrite and you're locking up citizens for happening to prefer the wrong mind altering substance.
Now do you see why so many of us think a life sentence is absolutely bullshit?
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:47:03
It could indeed be softforked, but we don't increase the block size until later with a HF. Can you point to a transaction or use case that comes anywhere near approaching the MAX_BLOCKSIZE/50 limit we have right now?

Not sure if there's native RBF support in Blockchain.info or not.  Do you have some kind of option to rebroadcast with a higher fee when you go to the transaction details?
If not you may need to import the private key(s) for the used inputs into another wallet and create a new transaction.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:21:39
There's one main use case being pretty negatively impacted right now, and that's basic p2p transactions for reasonable fees.
We're getting to the point of impacting fungibility when small inputs become uneconomical to even spend due to massive fee pressure. 
We need SegWit, but we need consensus to get it. If a small block size increase as a later hard fork gets that for us, why not at least explore it?  I think it's obvious at this point that the current 95% SegWit only activation isn't going to happen. UASF is a guaranteed chain split. BU is the same thing. Let's try to compromise and get the vast majority on board so we can move forward!  Otherwise an altcoin will undoubtably take bitcoin's network effect. 
I'm holding a significant amount of LTC for this reason. Still have way more BTC, however.

SegWit fixes quadratic sigops.  Hence why a 2MB block size is safe with SegWit in place. 
Not trying to be an ass, but you seem to be the one displaying technical ignorance here. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:55:02
So you're not technical enough to evaluate the basics(I wasn't getting into the weeds at all, just very broad statements) of various activation mechanisms, but they obviously display "grave technical ignorance" when it comes to what they proposed?
Not quite sure how to parse those two statements together...
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:27:49
What are your thoughts on the SegWit2MB compromise from Silbert and co?
I think it's become obvious at this point that we're not going to get consensus around SegWit only(feel free to disagree with me here) so doesn't that just make UASF a contentious fork that will almost certainly result in a chain split anyway?  I just don't see how that's any better...to me it's no better than a contentious hard fork since it will result in a split if all nodes and miners don't enforce the new rule...

So this uses no bloom filtering and is instead creating shortened txids(made possible since known forms of txn malleability are fixed in segwit) and the necessary calls to send/receive them so that nodes know what txns to include in the block from their local mempool?
Or am I not getting it?
What sort of CPU attacks do we know of when using bloom filters in the way that BU does?
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:46:52
Which is also easily solved with a sigops limit for non-SegWit transactions, which has been discussed and coded many times before.   Not at all dangerous as part of a hard fork.

@_date: 2017-05-26 16:40:14
I feel like you're moving the goalposts. A minute ago we were talking about activation mechanisms and activating with enough support to make it considered a fairly non-contentious enough change that a split is less likely, but now you're talking about both forks being listed on exchanges and miners deciding based on price?
I see SegWit 2MB as a potential way to get a large enough majority on board to perform an upgrade with minimal chance of a persistent chain split. It's going to use a non gameable activation mechanism, PoW signaling, before activating. You're talking about rolling the dice and hoping a split resolves in your favor. If anyone is being reckless and promoting a contentious and potentially dangerous solution, it's you.

Lifting what limits?  I'm not sure what your argument is.  I never said to relay free transactions.  Are you referring to keeping block size small in order to create fee pressure?  That's not sustainable, we need block size to increase so that aggregate fees can increase, not keep it small so that fees on individual transactions are prohibitively expensive.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:46:04

@_date: 2015-10-10 09:41:42
Because deciding which transactions are valid and which are spam is a slippery slope.  You're arguing for a political solution(blacklists or a human or group of humans labeling as spam), I'm arguing for a technical one(TX fees make spamming cost ineffective).
Email is a poor analogy because it costs very little to relay messages, bitcoin transactions are not the same.  Relay a million emails and a million transactions and tell me which one cost you more.
@_date: 2016-05-10 18:30:02
The only one of those that helps is compact block relay, and BU built on what Mike Hearn was working on OVER THREE YEARS AGO and built xtreme thin blocks, which actually does help.  I appreciate what they're working on there, but acting like Core is the only group that saw the need is disingenuous.
CPU was never the bottleneck, so the new libsecp256k1 library does zilch for block relay.
SegWit also does nothing to help block relay.

One man's spam is another man's transaction.  This reminds me of when you quietly included your own personal address blacklist in Gentoo(which I acknowledge you've since amended and apologized for).  If it pays a fee, and a miner mines it, it's not spam.
@_date: 2016-05-10 17:09:58

I still don't understand what you're trying to say. You said it was was all BS spam paying low fees, I pointed out that there were a lot of fees included with those 100k transactions.
Mining an empty block costs the same as mining one with 3000 high fee transactions in it.

This would be an excellent idea.  I have a feeling that xTB suffers from a case of "not invented here", which is why it hasn't been considered for merging into Core.  There are some potentially legitimate criticisms, however.
has raised some hypothetical scenarios where a maliciously constructed block could lead to a DoS attack via CPU consumption by the bloom filter(Greg, correct me if I'm wrong here).  If this is a known attack vector than it should be possible for someone to demonstrate on testnet with a BU client, yes?
I'd also love to see some compare/contrast between xTB and CB as well, unfortunately I'm not technically skilled enough to do so.

Only if most miners follow. They aren't showing more than 35% support for SegWit now, what exactly makes you think you're going to get a large majority behind UASF?
You're aware that the current UASF proposal intends to ignore blocks without the SegWit flag, right?

So since this requires blocks to be relayed in this compact index format, it seems to me that the amount of bandwidth and latency overhead will be greater than BU's solution.
