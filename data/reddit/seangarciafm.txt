simply submit 0.0005 (0.001 if you want to pick your number) to the sites address to buy a ticket. Be the 1st, 5th, 10th person to purchase a ticket and you will win on here through the promotion and on the site if you guess numbers correctly.

No, I replaced comment because it was posted from the wrong account. If you have all these logs you say you do of this thread you would know that I posted the same thing from this account. Your argument is irrelevant companies raffle things off all the time or require you to enter drawings it is not illegal. Judging by your username and all the negative comments you post frequently I can only assume you are some neckbeard troll that just gets off on sounding intelligent. Well it didnt work this time, now go shower and get some sunlight

Trust in the bitcoin world is a hard thing to come buy which is why we are here, to build it. We want the users of reddit to be the people to vouch for our site. We take only take a 15% house fee and if we can get users to enjoy our site thats all we will ever need. 
Fair numbers can be verified on each draw page. The numbers are generated by a random hash generated at the time the block is found. The FAQ explains in greater detail how this value is calculated. 
for example here:
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:53:21
Frequency = Thats the randomness of the draws. Each set of numbers is generated based on the next found block. 
Trust = Trust is why we are here we want people to help support us and realize we are a legitimate website. We chose to start on reddit because it is a good source to get ideas out there. 
Fair Numbers = You can look at each draw and see how the numbers were generated. No one can predict the time of the next found block. 
Jackpot is low because we just started the site. Which is also why the prices are so low.
