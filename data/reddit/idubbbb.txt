Facebook is entirely different. There isn't any form of hypocrisy here. Can you stay in touch with people via Changetip? No. You're trying to compare apples to oranges here, and it doesn't work.

I never said I believed the story. I've just been saying that there was no point in saying everything that you said, and there could be a chance that you really put a damper on somebody's day. You're getting awfully fired up about this. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:48:09
You are the definition of a pathetic and disrespectful asshole. Like I've said before, I bet you'll feel great if the story is true. You should feel like a real winner for saving the day. You do realize that people can make their own decisions, right? Nobody needs you to point anything out for them. Nobody needs your input. You've got nothing to offer except for negativity, and that's sad. In reality, you've got no idea whether or not this person is sincere or not. You've got your hunch, but you've got no proof at all. Like I've said before, I bet you'll go real far in life.

I apologize, I wasn't directing any of that at you. I was just addressing those with the attitude like the person who I initially responded to. Regardless, I agree with everything you've said.

So downvote and move on. Why give an *obvious hoax* a second thought? Just imagine what the world would be like if everybody had the same mindset as you. Honestly.
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:38:41
You really are stupid, aren't you? You're basing your entire argument on conjecture, and nothing concrete. It's so sad because you sound like you might be remotely intelligent, but you form the argument of a complete moron. I feel sad for you, kid. Just give up.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:29:09
Do you really believe that though? Is it that obvious that I "know how wrong I am"? I just don't understand why you can't realize that you're making yourself out to look like a complete dick in the case that this story is true. That's what it all boils down to. Do you go around to everybody in person and call them on their stories, telling them that their complete assholes for wasting the public's time? No, because you'd get the shit kicked out of you. So why do it on the internet? I just don't get people like you. You go out and act like a dick in order to gain absolutely nothing. If you're going to be a dick, at least do it for a good reason.

Take your own advice from the response to that thank you. Don't bother jumping into a thread like this again. You've offered nothing to the Bitcoin community, and thus there is no need for you to post here. Keep chanting that others are immature though. You're a real class act.

And won't you feel like a douche if this is a lady that lost her husband, and is sincerely looking for help. Who gives a shit if it's bologna? She isn't begging for tips or anything. If you don't want to help, don't help. Just move on. Think about what you're saying if this is all true, and consider how much of a heartless dick you appear to be. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:49:04
You're not going to make it far in life assuming everybody cries wolf. Best of luck to you.
@_date: 2014-04-07 18:21:42
You said it yourself. It's not that it's wonderful; it's convenient. For instance, I keep up with my sister and her kids via Facebook. It makes sharing photos with the family easy. Of course, I call her regularly too, but that's a bit different.  
It seems like your view is at the extreme end of the spectrum, and it also seems biased. There are those who treat Facebook like an addiction, and there are those who use it for it's useful features. Big difference, as far as I'm concerned.
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:29:24
See, the thing is that you didn't just say "oh you're not real". You dug in deep, and you were downright disrespectful. What do you have to gain by pointing out that this is an *obvious* hoax? Absolutely nothing. You gain nothing. So why bother? I'd wager that it took you more time to be an asshole to this person than it took people to offer some help. You bitch and moan about this being "so stupid and obvious", yet you take the time to give it a second and third thought.  
You know you're karma-whoring because what you're saying is in the back of everybody's minds. Of course there's a chance that she's full of shit; it's the internet for Christ's sake. And you rolled in here attempting to white-knight for the good of and alert everybody to your brilliant discovery. The sad part is that I don't even think you're trolling. You're just pathetic. Go use that masterful mind of yours to cure cancer or something.
@_date: 2014-03-02 07:38:45
You're solid at omitting what you actually said. Do you not recall telling the OP that they are a dick? For making up a story? That is not just stating that "the story has come up multiple times", nor is it just stating that "it's a hoax". It is disrespect in it's purest form. If you're mind is too thick with nonsense that you can't understand this, I don't know what to tell you. You're a lost cause. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:59:44
While you're certainly right, why in god's name should it be necessary that she provide proof that her damned husband passed away? She owes nothing to these people that completely doubt her, and they deserve no proof whatsoever. It's not like she's asking for charity. She's asking for help. Like I said, if you don't want to help, don't help. If you don't help and the story actually is bogus, congratulations, you've saved 10 minutes to stroke your monkey some more.  
It's absolutely disgusting that this idiot is just trying to whore some karma by potentially putting a decent lady looking for help down. Everybody knows that there is a possibility that the lady is just out for some kicks, but there is also a possibility that she is not. Perhaps some people are just willing to offer their assistance despite the *monumental* risk of the story not being true. Christ.

Those threads seem to be full of many more doubters than this one. It's obvious that those two threads (while obviously about the same situation, due to the titles) were blatant bullshit. There isn't anybody in the comments that is offering help. Notice anything different about this thread? Oh, maybe that people are actually trying to help? Because they aren't the same god damned threads with the same issues? You're losing your own argument kid. I can't even fathom how you could imagine you'd deserve a thank you for anything that you've done. You seem like you're a 15 year old troll just trying to make people mad. It wouldn't surprise me if that was true.

What I'm saying is to weight the benefits with the cost. Facebook is convenient; there's no denying that. It's a great way to stay in touch with people. Most people simply accept what they do because they'd rather keep in touch with their friends. With something like a tip bot, it doesn't make sense to accept such exploitation. There is no logical gain from it, as it doesn't offer much of anything. To argue that they are even remotely similar situations is idiotic.

Maine is gorgeous if you’re not too far up north. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:18:35
It’s cheaper to live in Maine overall. Southern Maine is getting a little tougher (Portland area and below) but Central Maine is dirt cheap.  
The housing market in NH is absurd right now. High sales prices with the property taxes to boot. No sales tax/income tax is great but renting gets old quick.  
I grew up through college in Maine and have lived in NH since. So I’ve looked into most of the options between the two states.

You generally aren’t going to pay tax on alcohol. Face price is what places charge most of the time (unless you’re in a restaurant or similar establishment of course).  
You can stroll into Hannaford and pick up a case of shitty beer for 17.99. No tax.

Thanks! Good on you for this little shin-dig.

Guess this is the right train for my first taste of BTC!
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:25:52
So what you're saying is that the very basics of economics absolutely apply to BTC? I guess I'm astonished by this because of how substantial the growth has been over the past year or so. It just doesn't seem like something that you can apply basic economic knowledge to, considering we've never really seen something so drastic.

You get charged 20 cents each time you use your debit card? This is a thing?
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:18:19
I wouldn't even bother to argue what Kyle was saying. He is completely bypassing the fact that you had a legitimate issue with the service, not just that your coins were worth this or that. This wasn't a concern that had anything to do with the stability of BTC, but rather the service that was providing you with the coins. People, man.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:13:15
I just want to know where OP's from.. I mean they're charging him/her for literally the only thing a debit card is good for. There has to be an alternative.
