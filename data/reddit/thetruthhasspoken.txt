In fact expensive products like houses or cars are not bought through credit cards.

The indecision might be the catalyst, but a correction was much needed after the last bull market, and bitcoin is simply less volatile than the others (both when there is a dip and when there is a bull)

Isn't that chart showing a volume of at best 20 million usd per week? Anyway i would like to see what happens if multiples countries block them, specially considering how many new people, with not much knowledge joined this world.
Didn't got your last point.

If a governement want to attack a cryptocurrency, nothing easier, just don't allow fiat exchanges and the cryptocurrency will be "dead". No need excuses.
Bitcoin doesn't have a central body? How many % of miners (and not small ones, but all big farms that are easly identified) are in china? The governement can do w/e they want with them.

I don't want to read the whole wikipedia thread, but from a fast look I just saw some random poor countries... USA + EU make crypto untradable with fiat -&gt; rip price.

I asked for what was wrong with premine, and you start regurgitating a lot of stuff about how vitalik is a scammer etc. Now that sentence alone would have make me run away from such a crypto-integralist, but since I'm curious I would like if you can answer my question. 
If satoshi in 2007 did a crowfund to make his project come true, and in exchange of the donations gave bitcoins, let's say 5kk bitcoin in total, what that would have changed? For me nothing.

If I was in that situation I would just find the first one on the street that wanted to buy it at half the price and liquidate it.. It would pretty risky to hold them in a situation like that, not worth the effort. Anyway  I would expect that some rumors will exit before a thing like that happens, so people would liquidate before it's too late... Anyway I hope we will never find out who is right
