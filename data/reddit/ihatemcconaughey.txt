To buy all things from boats to hash?

Ive bought and sold so much at a loss this past month because it keeps flying up. While my portfolio is still extremely profitable, it sucks missing out on gains.

I wish I had the capital for a project like this. All the best!

At .65. Was at .85, but made a rookie mistake and panicked. To the moon I go!

I also think back to all those times I had to use bitcoin to gamble online. Looking at some of the deposit history makes me sick.

I was a sophomore in college when someone told me about the concept of bitcoin back in 2010. He used it for dark web activities, but thought it served a greater purpose. At the time it was too complex, and I kept saying Ill get back to it. Fast forward a few years and I saw it hit $2000 and I damn near wanted to jump off a bridge. That day I signed up for the easiest alternative (Coinbase) and dumped in $500. Best decision I have ever made.

It was also referenced on Grey's before the winter break. The 2nd half of the season will start with it as a topic as well. Unfortunately it deals with cyber terror.

Couldnt agree more. We all have different perspectives &amp; distances to "our moon".
