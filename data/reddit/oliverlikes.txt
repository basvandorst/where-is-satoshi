Trezor doesn't log any data of users using the official Trezor web interface. Moreover, there's an option to run a [local instance of Trezor Wallet]( AND [Blockbook]( (fullnode), Electrum, Bitcoin Core client etc.
It's kinda true that the two Trezor models are very similar so far, but Trezor T is getting some pretty big and exclusive features soon.

Not quite. There's a [bit more nuance]( to this and Ledger is being very bold with their marketing strategy (pushing this narrative). Don't take everything at face value.

No you don't. What's your rationale?
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:28:35


It comes down to this. And still, people are reacting and making assumptions based on one Ledger blog post full of misleading information, and half-truths.
Can your Trezor/KeepKey be hacked within 5 minutes and only for $100?
Probably not, unless you lose your device near Ledger Donjon labs.
The $100 price tag alludes to the cost of an obscure hardware tool they developed to perform this PR stunt. Because Ledger has not publicly disclosed the details of the vulnerability, the cost of exploiting it HAS TO include the initial time for research, expertise, lab equipment, etc. In other words, if you cut enough corners in your arguments, you can prize the fighter jet engine in the amount of steel used to build it.
Implying that you cannot lose sight of your Trezor now, because every Joe Shmoe will be able to extract the seed from it within 5 minutes is straight-up nonsense.
As far as fixing the vulnerability goes; Not that easy to comment on, because [Ledger has not disclosed the full details even to the Trezor developers](


Again, very misleading. Ledger tried to make seems like you have to use 37 random characters, "or else!" As it turns out, [brute-forcing passphrases might not be that appealing]( unless it's a targeted attack with loads of money on the device..in which case, the user probably uses a long passphrase anyway.

The amount of money invested in BTC should correlate to level of your understanding of the technology. You should also consider, that Bitcoin is still a pretty risky move and therefore it's advised to invest only as much as you're willing to lose.

Bitcoin is supposed to simulate mining of precious metals. Let's look at this this way, shall we?
In 1850, if you were lucky and had sufficient manpower, you could find washed out gold nuggets in rivers in California, when the rivers were all picked out, you would follow the stream a dig a little bit around and find gold still very close to surface. However, because gold is scarce and doesn't grow like potatoes, soon you would have to dig deeper and deeper. Suddenly, gold digging isn't profitable for an average Joe because average Joe does not have access to cheap labor, technology etc. Nowadays, if you wan't to mine gold, you pretty much have to a billionaire already. It's not a way to get rich.
This is exactly how it went with bitcoin aswell. In 2010, you could mine bitcoins on that old laptop you left for your grandma. Today you can't, simply because bitcoin was programmed to automatically increase it's difficulty, which progresses really fast.

Title is completely wrong. The [source article]( says the new regulation only requires exchanges to identify their customers and they have been doing so anyway even before it was written in law. 
Then at the end it mentions plans of European commission to impose further regulatory pressure and brings the speculation that it could mean that registration and identification of customers may be necessary with all Bitcoin businesses.

That's not what I'm saying and I'm sorry if it's what you take from this exchange. Where does this resentment come from? 
If you have millions in Bitcoin, you probably stop thinking about it as "electronic cash", even though you're still able to pay with it. Many people regard Bitcoin as Gold 2.0, or an asset similar to bonds in which case you'd only use it for big purchases (a car, house, company shares or whatnot) and otherwise leave it in cold storage, hoping it will be a an effective hedge against turmoil on financial markets. 
This is after all, what drives all of this controversy about scaling issues. People don't get to agree on what Bitcoin should be primarily used for and how to categorize it but it doesn't undermine its usefulness

Fair enough. I guess it will always be about individual assessment first. Where is the Moon? Is your will to buy at 800 the same as it would be at 1300 or 1500? It should not matter if you lose some change in the transit if you believe that BTC will land above 5k eventually. I'd love to hear from someone who actually knows how USD and BTC accounts are handled on Coinbase. As far as I'm concerned, once you're willing to leave your cash there, you might as well just have it there for a month in whatever form.
Anyway, I'm just a moron thinking aloud :) I'm also paid monthly and always buy bitcoin for whatever price available at that moment, however I live in Europe and use Bitstamp.

Not only that. 
1. To initiate the firmware update, the user has to confirm the action using the physical button
2. Loading an unofficial firmware erases the memory on the device, so the firmware could not have touched the private keys anyway.
3. This has never happened before and it's very unlikely that if it were to happen, some poor guy with 5 BTC would be the one to bite the bullet. There are much bigger fish to target with sophisticated remote attacks.

Ledger disclosed these vulnerabilities back in March so what exactly are you talking about? Should I look up some more events in the calendar for you, just in case you feel as if it hasn't been "disclosed enough" yet?
What you're doing here is a marketing campaign. A pretty bad one too.

24 words generated by Trezor One. Trezor T (the newer one) generates a 12-word seed.

You clearly do not understand how non-custodial wallets work ;) The private keys generated by a hardware wallet do not go anywhere - making you the sole owner and operator.

You'll find a neat little comparison at trezor.io (scroll down a bit).
Trezor One - the original, cheaper, two physical buttons, microUSB
Trezor T - newer model, touchscreen, USB-C, better hardware, modern codebase-more flexible development, more coins, more features, enables you to do everything on the device using the touchscreen (recovery, passphrases, PIN...)

Trezor+Cryptosteel+a good padlock
When the [SLIP39]( is finished: Trezor+bunch of cryptosteels ;) as safe as it gets
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:05:12
The safest approach for long-term, passive holding:
1. Get a Trezor and a Cryptosteel
2. Generate a backup (recovery seed), print some receiving addresses
3. Use the Cryptosteel to secure the seed, wipe the hardware wallet so you don't have to worry about firmware updates or durability of electronics
4. Lock the Cryptosteel with a padlock, take good care of it and sleep tight
(5. recover the backup and spend your cryptocurrencies once you need it)

You can run Trezor Wallet web interface locally. It would take you about 20 seconds to find this information if you really wanted to ;)

Sorry for your loss.
Please take a minute to read these two articles on Trezor Blog:
["Phishing attacks used to steal your coins (recommended reading)"](
["A Message for Our Community About Recent Phishing Attacks."](
Your best bet would be reporting the theft to your local authorities and hoping for a miracle.

surely, it would just make sense to hold tight to BTC if we see continual and gradual devaluation of fiat currencies and stabilization of crypto-currencies over some LONGER period of time, let's say years... But I guess it would make some real psychological pressure on sellers if Bitcoin jumped to 10k over month, because how can anybody be sure it's not just another bubble, right? People would start thinking about one in a lifetime opportunities and all..

But of course! :) Hardware wallets generate a mnemonic seed which you can (should) write down your paper - making it as papery as you wish. Except, unlike with traditional paper wallets, this is only one part of its lifecycle and it's much more convenient and less prone to human error. I wrote about it a bit in this [blog post]( if you're interested (shameless plug, I know).
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:54:54
Stop recommending paper wallets to beginners, please. Or to anyone for that matter. Paper wallets are obsolete and absolute shit in every dimension when compared to hardware wallets.

You're a parasite company outright stealing Trezor brand, reputation, original web design features **and** have the audacity to wonder if there's anything wrong with it?
Use Trezor open-source software with an original brand, logo, hardware, and website the way Archos did and nobody will make a fuss (you would get some eye-rolls).
What you're doing now is freakishly unethical and illegal. The fact that you're not able to see it says a lot about what kind of people you are.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:44:18

@_date: 2019-05-15 13:14:54
Look, it sure would be fantastic if everyone used NixOs, but try to stay in reality, please :)
The whole point of hardware wallets is to offer an insolated environment and make it convenient and easy enough for casual users and beginners. People need to learn to trust their physical wallets (the devices) exclusively, even assuming that everything else has been compromised.
It's clear that both Ledger and Trezor will encounter indirect challenges like phishing sites and software. Phishing scams on the internet have been a thing for decades. Awareness and education go further than technological advancement ;)
TL;DR You're never going to get mainstream adoption if you keep expecting that everyone will magically abandon Windows. Even if they did, the issue is clearly somewhere else (understanding the seed and using it cautiously).
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:03:39

I know what **exactly** is the issue and which implementation is "the correct one" but...
The signatures are the same, just misaligned in the first character :-/
When you sign the message "a" on the address "1" in Electrum, you get a signature which reads (for example): H8Yrl3hoFGlWbjynF4ZKD+G7and_so_on
Use the signature in Trezor, but change the "H" at the start to "I",..if it starts with "I", change it to "J" etc.
