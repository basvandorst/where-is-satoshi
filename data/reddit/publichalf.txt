Like money, its value is related to its capability as medium of exchange. If you are looking for a backup value (the role gold played when dollars where truth), think that gold is valuable because it is hard to obtain; same for bitcoin.

My thought is based in economic press, not forums or marginal webpages related to crypto. You’re right, I cannot view the future, but the asked question is why we believe that cryptocurrencies are a good bet, and that’s my position.

Exchanges are not wallets. You can use them, but it’s is not a good idea. You want your cryptos to be safeguarded, and the only safe computer is which isn’t connected to internet. There are exchanges using cold wallets and other security mechanisms, but no one is better than a USB physical wallet.

I bet on ATM. In Spain all of them, despite the bank, rely on the same net since a couple of months...

Just keep in mind Blockchain and crypto currencies are not the same. Fiat currencies can became more competitive in terms of performance (fees and speed) through Blockchain technology, but they will always be air-backed while govs let banks print money. Debt bubble must explode.

It’s like gold standard coming back. Global debt is bigger than 200% world wide real economy. The question is how is possible that people (included myself) rely on fiat currencies. Furthermore, it’s not related to the economy of a country, so future trade wars will pump bitcoin up.

Some pairs altcoin-USD are not available for euros, so we use dollars or crypto as a bridge.

Good fame for banks, nobody would try to avoid their intermediation in his finances /s

I have more crypto than stocks. Actually, I haven’t got stocks yet. And, honestly, it’s being more difficult for me to rely on any stock than on crypto. My bet is about a worldwide debt collapse but this is a long-term viewpoint. Due to credit expansions nowadays debt in the world is more than twice bigger than the truly economy, and keeps growing. Depending on your investment scope, maybe the roles of crypto and stocks will be interchanged in the statement of your post...

That’s democracy? Governments giving money to people? Some richness is diluted each time a government creates money from nothing, and that’s exactly what it seems... Why does somebody wanted to save SOV if Marshall Islands gov can release more tokens whenever they want? I hope have misunderstood the concept...

Bought 1.7BTC and say enough with 1.05BTC... so -38% of my invest

1. and 2. Increase of the price would solve both. That will be naturally performed by the market.
3. The monetary system is supposed to represent value, not to create it.
4. Gold make the depression or the substitution of gold-backed money with nothing-backed dollars and incentives to cheap credits?
5. Dollars haven’t “intrinsic value” neither. Actually, the intrinsic value of a mean of exchange is its usefulness for interchange items and services. So, the most accepted it is, the more intrinsic value it has: price grows according to this evolution.

Is IP the best protocol for the net layer? No, it was de first. Same for BTC, that’s my viewpoint. I’m just interested in another crypto: IOTA. The rest of them are fake bitcoins.

Aside chains I think was the point where the feature was added. But I’m sure that “smart contract bitcoin” search will be successful.
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:56:29
That’s named “smart contract” if you want to google it. Originally was implemented in the Ethereum Blockchain but now there is a way over Bitcoin’s one too.

Surely the bullrun is due to this /s

I thought there is a relationship between smart contracts and LN. Look at this

Thinking about myself, it was a lot of money for me when I was 13. But, ok, if you got it and you prefer to own BTC than buying a bike (I don’t know, whatever a 13yo kid wanted), probably it is the most responsible use you can give to it. But, please, be concerned about the possibility of losing it. My bike was stolen so nothing is secure, just avoid make your decision because someone told you that it is the only thing you need for becoming rich.
