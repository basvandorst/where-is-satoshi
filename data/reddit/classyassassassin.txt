No... it isn't. Do you know left wing means?
@_date: 2014-04-15 03:04:08
The man does have a point... You cannot avoid paying your taxes just because you are paid in bitcoin. Have fun getting audited. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:29:46
Yeah, guess I believed the lies. I've always had anti-virus on here just in case. Gonna run a quick sweep.
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:21:09
I'm a bitcoin user myself.. I've been a bitcoin user since I hear about it in 2012. Just pisses me off how libertarian some of us can be. Just because we use bitcoin doesn't mean we have to be a libertarian....
@_date: 2014-04-15 03:25:11
lol. Alright. Well continue supporting the banking system that all of America seems to complain about. I'll stick to bitcoin and cash withdraws from my one checking account at a local credit union. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:00:13
But I had 0 dollars in my bank account that is linked to it and only .005 bitcoin on this account... Just seems pointless to hack me as I am broke, and don't even own more than 10 dollars worth of bitcoin. The hacker has only used my coinbase account, I still have all my dogecoins and some leftover change on localbitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:30:18
edit: holy shit, never mind. Apparently I linked a bank account to this. Did not realize I did this. So this person is trying to buy 5 btc from a checking account in which I literally have 0 dollars in. That's why these transactions are being denied, I have insufficient funds. What now? I'm guessing this guy won't be able to buy anything considering I have 0 dollars in that checking account and plan on putting nothing in there.
edit 2: I'm just going to close my checking account tomorrow.. Hopefully that should end any possible mischief.. I'm just scared cause now this guy has my name and shit.
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:55:34
Don't be so obtuse. Decentralization will not magically solve corruption.
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:56:32
Noo idea.. :/ I use a mac for everything, so it's not like my computer is infected. Luckily the email I use is one I don't use often, but I'll be changing up the password.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:47:13
You're looking too deep into this, so many of you are. The man changed his name to hide his identity, it's obvious he created this. But of course most of you have to believe this is some sort of conspiracy, and satoshi just stole some random japs name. Don't be stupid, people. It's obvious after reading the article that this guy created, or had a huge part in creating bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:29:10
Ahaha. Well I upvoted you at first because I thought you were being sarcastic.. but it appears you're just a far left winged libertarian . You're just as bad as right winged republicans preaching about anti-abortion. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 21:25:53
For some reason you saying dense made me want to say obtuse.. I guess both are words that can be used in math questions and can also describe a human! haha
Dreaming of a world 50 years ago...? Globalization is so much more rampant in today's world that I wouldn't even dream of the US we had in the 90's. Decentralization may be beneficial for those living in a nation ruled by a dictator.. but it's not beneficial for developed, first world countries. Sorry I don't like the idea of living in a socialist, decentralized nation.
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:52:33
I'm dead serious. The libertarian circle jerk is strong in this thread. Some of you even sound like anarchists. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:59:24
Why are you here? 
Why do you use bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:44:37
I sent coinbase an email. Why would someone do this, though? It wasn't connected to my bank account, yet someone is using a bank transfer to try and buy these coins. Are they just trying to use my identity or some shit?
@_date: 2014-04-15 03:42:16
Whatever... You're just a sheep. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:20:33


That's so incredibly hard for some companies to do. Saying "decentralize everything!!" is straight up retarded. Middlemen are not evil, they are businessmen, but let me guess... you think businessmen are evil sheep too?? Get your head out of your left winged, libertarian ass.
@_date: 2014-12-25 04:53:58
Honestly.. You're surprised people didn't expect this..? Get the fuck out of here. That's obviously not the first thing that comes to someones mind when it comes to donating a dollar for this. Sending a dollar shouldn't be so difficult.
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:18:38
Ah, yeah. That makes sense. I honestly just never would have even considered the legal altercations that could arise from 1,000 people sending a dollar.. Starting now I'll try and keep this kind of stuff in mind, especially for small crowd funding like this.
@_date: 2014-04-12 18:20:22
Goddamit... hahah

Wow. Never knew this. I have sophos anti-virus on here as well, and it doesn't seem to be finding any viruses.
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:13:08
Is this comment supposed to be sarcastic?
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:15:33
No. I think this person may have enabled it with their own number. And I cannot switch it to my number without knowing the original. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 01:44:07
Havent they ever heard of resistance? Or fueling up for moon shot?
@_date: 2016-11-28 22:03:46
Sounds nice
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:35:01
We'll see who's laughing in a few weeks.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:18:23
You can store all your coins on a btc-e account.

Sent it to a bitcoin address
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:10:00
It will never get that high, I doubt it will even pass 250 dollars!
@_date: 2013-10-16 02:33:01
BTC will crash to 130 tomorrow. Calling it.
@_date: 2013-10-09 20:45:53
I doubt it will ever go over 300 dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:22:21
To da moon!!
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:47:06
I'm surprised this was even upvoted. Every time I bring up bitcoin dropping I just get downvoted. Obviously it's going to drop people, this growth is too insane for it not to. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:35:15
What's up with you guys and "selling" your bitcoin?? I don't want to sell shit, I want to buy stuff!
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:29:01
Guarantee you that number can be associated with a few multi millionaires pumping and dumping.. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:16:29
Holy shit, yes..This will be amazing. Put this anywhere in Chicago and I'll be sure to give you business. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:38:13

@_date: 2013-12-08 19:17:10
lolololol. Doubt that. Should be 700's all day. 800's tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:05:32
No, not really. There would be a *huge* increase in multi-hundred millionaires and billionaires if bitcoin were to be 1 million a piece. This would make bitcoin the best investment of **all time**.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:54:24
I used bitinstant today and got my btc within 45 minutes.
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:43:43
How would I go about buying in?
@_date: 2013-10-16 16:20:00
Considering selling my reddit accounts for 10,000 btc.
PM me if interested.
@_date: 2013-10-24 01:58:04
How profitable can a share be? All you guys sound excited, but I see too much risk in this.
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:58:40
It's not about luck.. It's about knowing when is a good time to buy and sell. I mean goddamn. You don't have a be a genius to see bitcoin will have a steady drop eventually - with exponential growth comes a slow or even steady decline (history tends to repeat itself). Selling at 200 and buying back in later when it's around 125 again is probably the smartest thing you can do. That's not luck. The luck is having btc magically jump to 200 dollars so you can make huge profits.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:18:21
You can print a paper wallet from here. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 05:57:20
Why buy at 185?? Shit is gonna drop back down to 120 in a few weeks.. Can't keep going up and up, without going back down.
@_date: 2013-10-16 16:35:50
Micro drops are healthy!
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:41:12
You are a kind soul. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:07:10
You're only making things worse.
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:35:13
With exponential growth like this, I can say with certainty it will go back down eventually.. Any person who took a basic level economics class can tell you that. Like you said, bitcoin is volatile, so volatile that it is able to drop back down to 125. You act like you haven't seen this shit happen before? Seems like you're the one who doesn't understand who this market works, buddy. The price can't keep on rising forever.. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:40:47
You have a mining rig... Why are you begging?
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:18:18
I used to do them last year, made .02, now it's impossible to make any coin at all so I stopped
@_date: 2013-10-09 23:43:16
Mannn, you guys in threads be hella crazy sometimes. I love the optimism! 
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:59:11
I can almost guarantee my prediction of the future based off the past.
