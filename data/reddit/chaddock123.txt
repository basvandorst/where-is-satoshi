i think you're being downvoted because you make several basic errors in maths.
 for example:




In the general case, if blocks are found at a 10 minute interval, then the average wait time is half of that. Like, sometimes you wait 9 minutes, sometimes 8 minutes, ... sometimes 2 minutes, sometimes 1 minute - all are equally likely, so the average wait time is half of the 10 minute block time. Since the 10 minute block interval varies, instead of being rigidly fixed, I believe the average wait time will be a bit more than 5 minutes, but the general principle is 'half the interval time', not the wait time being the entire interval time. (more maths on this here  )


It does increase. In the time since the last block, more and more possible solutions to the next block have been tested and ruled out; the miners are closer to finding the answer the more time they have already spent working on solving the block and eliminating possible solutions.


it is not like saying that at all. Flipping a sequence of coins is a series of _independent_ events. But, the miners make successive guesses at solving the block, and when they make the 2nd guess, they know the 1st guess has been ruled out - the parameters for their 2nd guess are different now, after the work done for the 1st guess.
