The Greek crisis is regarding sovereign debt. Regardless of austerity as a solution, your problem with the fractional reserve system doesn't really have any place is this discussion.
Still, thank you for your BOE source. I'm sure it'll be helpful for anyone who hasn't taken Macro 101, or Intro to Monetary Economics.

This piece attempts--at all costs--to inspire and embolden the reader, but just comes off as severely biased and conspiratorial. 
Wonder how it seemed to completely missed [this little event]( which preceds the author's 'stage 1.'

Firstly, Greek fiscal policy isn't 'managed' by private banks (as you originally implied). Furthermore, the quote you're using is relating to monetary policy which is not applicable to Greece.
Second, yes, in general, austerity can lead to price level deflation (ie. your "shortage in money supply"). No one debates that. It *might* be different in Greece, since it is **already** experiencing deflation from a crippled agg. output. However, digressing about that probably isn't important to you.
I was going to write more regarding how the noncompetitive Greek economy and it's corrupted tax base needs to change in the next 20 years and how this is all just a sign of the failed Euro experiment... etc etc. However, I don't think this would be of any use discussing here.
**Instead, I'll just suggest this**: go read up on some macroeconomics. If this topic truly interests you, you'll find the intuitions of the material are easy to grasp. You might just find a new passion*... and you might just also find that a 'fractional banking system' of some kind is an entirely necessary part of everyone's life....especially if you enjoy ANY of the simple modern comforts in life. But, after reading up, that's for you to decide.*
