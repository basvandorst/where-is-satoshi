How does one check the wallet in an offline computer?
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:46:51
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:14:22
Any software you'd recommend in particular? Electrum?
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:23:46
True, but this way I'd get a new laptop. Decisions, decisions...
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:08:47
This was what I had been thinking. I can see the appeal of hardware wallets for those who are transacting fairly frequently. But for just hodling for many years, I don't see much real benefit to getting one.
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:16:16
Which is the same as what a hardware wallet does isn't it? So it would be no different? (Other than convenience)
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:14:40
Can you elaborate on the disadvantages relating to transfers into it? Not sure I follow. Do you just mean it's easier to identify one address than if the transactions were going to multiple?
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:49:47
5% really? That seems pretty high
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:05:13
I get this, but I think people are sometimes overly paranoid. How about, when going to sweep the paper wallet, just use a new laptop that's never been connected to the internet before? Wouldn't this eliminate the risk? (For a one time transaction)
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:49:22
Calm down. It's these kind of answers which led me to asking this question in the first place!
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:52:53
$12k today?
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:22:26
Yup, I always deposit to coinbase using Revolut now
@_date: 2019-08-15 07:53:40
Weird. Are you using card payment or doing a transfer? I have to do an international transfer even though it's GBP, because their bank account is in Estonia. Usually takes about a day
@_date: 2019-10-04 23:20:22
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:20:45
How is a traditional paper wallet insecure?
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:33:00
Use coinbase Pro and place limit orders, that way you'll be charged the maker fee which is only 0.15% (used to be free!)
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:47:09
Aaaaaaaaaaaaand it's gone
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:00:57
I'll be switching to Kraken then. Also, maker fee the same as taker for under $50K? Why??
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:56:09
The 4% is just for deposit by card isn't it? If you do a bank transfer instead it's basically free
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:50:32
What was the volume of that dump?
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:24:02
Just buy when you can, price will keep going up in the long term anyway
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:50:31
Went to sell at $11,200. Internet cut out for a few minutes. Back online, see $10,800 &gt;:(
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:02:20
Lol, didn't realise I had typed "physiological barriers"!
Won't people also be waiting to sell at these round numbers? Or are they typically outnumbered by buyers at these points?
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:51:43


Can you explain why this is, how do you arrive at this estimate?
@_date: 2019-05-07 17:32:23
Yeah I get this, however what I don't understand is, surely other currencies, such as USD, GBP or EUR don't have any "intrinsic value" either?
@_date: 2019-05-07 17:34:38
So for notes, e.g. $100 bills, doesn't this mean it's intrinsic value is negligible?
@_date: 2019-05-07 17:39:02
So by that definition, is bitcoin any different to USD or GBP in terms of "intrinsic value"?
