What has he done that is dishonest?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:07:06
This.

The whole crypto market cap increased by 6 billion. I think it's more than bch
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:42:12
Friendster was comparable. But yeah that guy was dick about it. He missed the point. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:08:14
Wow, that bitcoin vs gold price chart with two different scales is atrocious.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:02:23
Yeah they really fucked us with national debt
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:09:19
I'm pretty sure he meant "assets".  Hold onto your assets, as in, don't sell your bitcoin.

I don't understand the store if value argument. Is it just that if the increase in block size doesn't work properly the price will drop?
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:06:41
I thought the same thing because of that movie.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:52:38
Ah, that makes sense.  Thanks.


I didn't understand this.  In the US, the only thing the gov't can inflate is the USD, which for many is both the store of value and mode of transaction.

People without much money will be the last ones in.
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:06:28
Isn't crypto is just as prone to individual hacks and theft?
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:20:35
If it's a gamble, you are wrong to speak as though you know what's about to happen.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:34:31
Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:26:45
Oh please.  I could throw my phone in a lake it would have virtually no lasting impact on the rest of my life.  GPS is a luxury for people who are too lazy to read maps and/or remember the location of things.
Also, "you kids"??? Get over yourself.  You sound like a the bitter old neighbor that sits on his porch and yells at the kids in a coming of age film.  I'm not even close to being a kid, and lived most of my life without GPS in my pocket, so check your assumptions before you start blabbering away like an ignoramus.

The discussion was about the space race specifically. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:34:10
I agree with that.   I was thinking more in terms of the direct result of landing on the moon and such.  Indirectly, I agree, the technology that came out of the space race was important.  But it will be nothing compared to AI.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:00:08
The space race was all about ego and pride, and didn't really change our lives much, while A.I. could change everything.  
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:32:07
Not me.  I lived most of my life without GPS.  It's a nice luxury, but that's about it.
I concede that the Space Race did change the world, but indirectly, as suddenly having a man on the moon, in and of itself had no consequence.  I also believe the indirect effects of the space race will pale in comparison to AI.
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:29:39
Sure, but the race wasn't about developing the technology.  That was a benefit but not the primary motivation.  And the technology we got out of the space race will pale in comparison to crypto and AI in terms of changing the world.
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:50:45
It's destroying a publicity stunt?
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:43:07
I don't agree. Doubters will win just like everyone else who holds.  They should stay in. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:35:12
What do you mean by big-blocker?  Why does segwit go against thier ideology?
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:01:22
Can bitfinex connect to your bank? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:55:53
I think cryptos will progress faster than computing did
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:49:13
So it 2013 I should have sold
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:08:54
I think the China, Korea, and Japan acceptance is a big change. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:59:53
This is fucking PERFECT
