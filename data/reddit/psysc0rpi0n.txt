I spoke to some ** with name **Lisa Dąbrowskia** from channel Trading Crypto Coach.
 
They pinned this message in their Telegram Group
I paid 0.01BtC for this and I got access to anything else I didn't have already access.
I sent BtC to this wallet:
Then I sent another 0.01BtC to the same address to be able to join some pre-pump thing.
She said I would be invited to a channel where pre-pump people would be chatting. **I GOT NO INVITE.**
They have no videos on Youtube, no official site, nothing, so this is **A SCAMM.**
This is part of my conversation with her for like 2 days. She deleted most of the messages:
This is not to ask for mercy or pitty or feel sorry about me. It's just to alert Telegram users about this group.
This group admin or whatever she/he is was pissed off because I wasted some of her time and I invested only 0.01BtC.
This is part of a conversation a friend of mine had with her where she told him what I've just mentioned:
Please share this to as many people as you can.

I was also scammed by this Telegram group. This is no joke. I pasted my post here because I saw something related to my scam which was Trading Crypto Coach Telegram group.
Please share and be aware.
