okay, I hope you find a solution that will satisfy your needs. If you do work on a solution, please let the community know, and we shall listen and make a decision. 
For now, this seems to be a fair pool with some key benefits, reference point: 
I have elaborated more on this press release in details

I am a big fan of Directpool and I have listed a guide for others to see the (backend) of this pool. My DirectPool Review! 
Glad to know I am mining on a pool that is doing great things for the community, Bitcoiners, we need a new pool if we want to remain decentralized. And what better if these guys are helping with the growth of Bitcoin in the business aspect, along with the pool aspects. It's a win-win. I have pointed my ASIC miners to DP as of now. 
+1 to BitcoinBigfoot for the article. I love what BitcoinBigfoot is also doing for us, this is amazing stuff.

It is old-- until someone shows Google how much support they have from the community, and I am ready to do that with my  direct communication methods.

You, the miner is taking benefits from this first and foremost, by preventing 51% attacks since a majority of the BITCOIN pools were very close a few times. (lots of close calls) There was a reddit discussion that went viral a few times:

then you don't understand bitcoin. There shouldn't be centralization that is it, why not add a new pool that is trying to prevent future bitcoin network problems? 
It is up to the miners to decide where they want to mine after considering all available resources (pools) and directpool is giving back more resources than any pool in the industry.This is not a discussion about you to decide what is the solution or not, it is awareness as to what the Bitcoin community has in front of them.
