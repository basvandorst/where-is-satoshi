Here is an answer I just posted on another thread:


Your shipping address is only displayed to the buyer you choose. No one can see it without your agreement.
@_date: 2014-11-18 09:52:54
Brawker's system is a bit different than purse.io. You have the ability to choose who's paying for your order.
When you place an order on Brawker, you'll receive bids from people. You'll be able to review their profile, past transactions, text reviews from other users, etc.
Then, you can select the one you like best, based on his reputation on Brawker, offer, past transactions...
Your shipping address is only displayed to the buyer you choose. No one can see it without your agreement.
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:35:27
Yes, definitely. But unfortunately I'm not sure it will help a lot...
We're using JavaScript to generate the seed and get the master public key from it. We're also using JavaScript to hash / encrypt the seed, and to sign the transactions.
But we use users master public keys to generate the transactions server-side. JavaScript is only used to sign them.
We'll open source this code (it's already available since it's JavaScript) so you can:
* Get your bitcoins back if Brawker is offline/whatever
* Make sure the escrow address we give you actually uses one of your keys
* Make sure we don't know your password and we're not able to access your private keys
However, we're writing a blog post so any other developer can implement the multisig process.

Brawker developer here. I'll try to keep things simple, three things:
- A built in antifraud that looks for suspicious patterns, based on a lot of parameters/data. We're improving it all the time
- The merchant own anti fraud system (some have 3D Secure, do checks on delivery address, etc, it all depends on the merchant)
- Brawker reputation system. You get a rating after each transaction. You can edit it later if needed. Everyone can see your reputation.
If you're worried about fraud, only deal with users who already did a few transactions and had no complaints. :)

We try to answer all of them. If you have more or if we don't see them, our support team will help you, you can contact them. About fraud we answered a lot of times, but are working on a new system. For now, here is how it works: 
What do you mean by resolving disputes? Technically, we can choose either we refund the bitcoin spender, or we send the payment to the bitcoin buyer (if they agree to, of course). All disputes are different, it's almost impossible to have a defined pattern. We have someone working for Brawker to resolve disputes.
When someone marks an order as "paid", he's prompted to forward the order confirmation email to a secure email address we provide. Then, we generate a PDF from this email for security reasons (XSS, phishing...) and send it to the other person in the transaction. Of course, you can always forge the email. But you wouldn't be able to provide a tracking number, etc.
Initially, we planned on calling the ecommerce website to know if the order was received or not, but we actually never had to.

Brawker team member here. I wrote a message yesterday about how we're handling fraud issues at Brawker and what we're doing.
Copy pasting the answer:

- Brawker reputation system. You get a rating after each transaction. You can edit it later if needed. Everyone can see your reputation, if you did a chargeback, etc.






@_date: 2014-11-27 13:48:41
To be honest, since last year, I'm wondering why they're not switching to a 2-of-3 multisig.
1 key encrypted in your browser
1 key in blockchain's servers
1 key in your safe
- If you ask for a regular payment, they add their key to yours.
- If you ask for a full withdrawal they set it pending, then call you / send you an email / whatever, before using their key.
- If they try to fuck up with you, you get your key from the safe.

The built-in verification and anti fraud system, and users reputation. :)
We're going to do many releases about that in the coming weeks.
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:45:11
I noticed the orders asking for a 20% discount receive less offers from the users. Maybe you received counter offers (offers with a different discount than the one you asked for)?
This is not the proper place to talk about fraud, but we started working on fraud related issues way before releasing the project. We're spending more and more time on these issues, and will communicate a bit more about that soon. We always gather as much information as possible, but had no chargeback issue for now.
We're improving the system all the time, but are facing different issues. For example:  you're not allowed to force someone to show his ID when he's using a VISA card. You're not allowed to use Stripe or any other payment gateway to do credit card verification.
We're asking our buyers to go through a verification process. Then we follow their activity both manually and automatically. There's nothing like great tools and a good human brain.
If you want to make sure you're not at risk, take a user who already purchased a few bitcoins. That means he went through both the verification process and our eyes, and no other user complained about him.
@_date: 2014-07-17 09:09:34

It's definitely NOT just like purse.io
I'm a Brawker developer.
Since the beginning, I spent more than half my time working on the verification and fraud detection system we have. While Purse.io has none and "relies on Amazon own anti fraud".
- We have a verification system.
- We have a built in fraud detection system.
- We monitor users in real time with the strongest anti fraud systems
- We're always improving these systems over the time
And as a matter of fact, this never happened to one of our users.
So no, Brawker is definitely not just like purse.io
@_date: 2014-09-20 15:41:37
Well, that's actually a very different subject.
With purse.io you can only order goods from Amazon, where on Brawker you can order anything.
I won't talk about purse.io since I don't work there, they may have changed a lot of things on their product.
At Brawker, we have a quick user verification process, and an anti fraud system, that prevents a lot of fraudsters from buying bitcoins.
Then comes one of our new features, when you're able to choose for who's allowed to pay for your order or not. That means you can choose buyers based on their profile/reputation (comments from other users), so you can end up always dealing with guys you trust, or people who already bought a lot of Bitcoins.

Just like heavyuser1337 said, people I know have no issue with their money, they pay with their credit card, have no use for remittances. Everything works just fine for them. They don't care about free money, free communications, or decentralized market place, since they have no issue with what already exists. You can't solve a problem they don't have.
I thought the meshnet used in Hong Kong would be an awesome example for people to understand why it's important to have decentralized networks. Now I definitely think we should wait to find some strong use cases before talking to people about blockchain etc.

Don't blame us for their mistake, no one ever got raided by police after buying something on Brawker.

Bitcoins are 7% higher than the market price
@_date: 2014-11-09 10:24:56
It's not that hard but you need to spend some time developing it.
First, how is it possible to perform a double spend attack:
* Take an unspent output
* Sign a TX that sends the bitcoins to your service
* Sign a TX that sends the bitcoins to your own address
* Broadcast each TX to different nodes
There is a chance you get both the funds credited on the service, and the bitcoins on your account.
An idea to solve this:
* Get a few bitcoin nodes monitoring the network in different places of the world (5? More? Idk)
* When you accept a 0-conf transaction, monitor the output from your other nodes, to make sure it's not spent another time without you knowing it
* If the output is also spent somewhere else, cancel the transaction immediately. If not, you're good
This way, you should be able to cancel the funding on your services before the first confirmation happens, if the guys try to double spend.
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:01:12

We highly recommend, everywhere on the interface and on the emails notifications you receive, that you should not release the escrow before you have the goods in your hands.
Canceling an order before it ships is as easy as sending an email.
About fraud, we have something in place that works quite well for now. But we're improving it a lot.
I'm copy/pasting the implementation we currently have, then I'll talk about what we're implementing.
three things:
- A built in antifraud that looks for suspicious patterns, based on a lot of parameters/data. We're improving it all the time
- The merchant own anti fraud system (some have 3D Secure, do checks on delivery address, etc, it all depends on the merchant)
- Brawker reputation system. You get a rating after each transaction. You can edit it later if needed. Everyone can see your reputation, if you did a chargeback, etc.
We do agree that it's good, but we can do better. We asked ourselves the following question: "What does someone honest has that a scammer doesn't?"
And came with the following answer: The physical credit card.
Stolen credit cards come from online phishing, database leaks, etc. You buy the informations, never the physical card.
We're working night and days into implementing something great from this idea, without being too intrusive about privacy. We planned to release it in the next few days, and provide an even better service.

If you were talking about this


I was thinking of the different anti fraud APIs and databases that are available on the internet. You can easily find a few companies that analyzes your data and look for their own patterns, or provide information you don't have.
We're using these on top of our own fraud detection patterns, which we feed with everything we can collect and change/improve over the time.
You can also use social APIs to get more data on your customers (eg:  This is especially useful for all our manual checks (yes, we check all the orders and their users, that's how we figure out the patterns).

During the order process, you're prompted to provide all the emails you're receiving from the merchant. We convert them to PDF and display them on the order page.
It's very easy to check if the order has been made or not.
You could forge the documents, forge the tracking number (which is harder), but why would you do that for $10? It never happened for now. Checking if the order has been placed is very easy with all the documents, and when in doubt, you can call the shop.

I'm not sure that would make any difference. People paying with their credit card won't go to coinbase or whatever to buy some bitcoins, just to spend them on Amazon.

Brawker does the same, except it's more decentralized. Escrows are multi signatures and stored in the blockchain, so you can see your money and make sure no one can steal it while you're paying for the order / waiting to receive your item.

Why do you send bitcoin amounts in so many different formats? I guess sending it with a Integer satoshis would be safer, to make sure developers don't screw up and use the string or decimal to make calculations after.

Do you really think the technology is mature enough to be considered something else than "early adopter"? For now, all we have are payments processors and exchanges.
When we will be able to go one step further, on top of this first layer, then maybe new people won't be early adopters.

I stopped reading when it came to Paris, and he's saying there was a shooting in the street at a peaceful march, with dead people etc.

Thanks for sharing.
The code works, but you should consider using objects, modules, and something better than callbacks to handle asynchronous tasks (promises, generators...), or you'll end up with crappy code sooner than expected. :)
Also, when writing Bitcoin related code, you can't afford a single bug since you can loose some precious coins. You should write tests, even if it's just to show what we can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript. People need to understand that untested code is almost worthless and can be dangerous. A few beginners might play with your snippet, teach them the good practices. :)

rules do not preclude merchants from asking for cardholder ID except in the
specific circumstances discussed in this guide, merchants cannot make an ID
a condition of acceptance. Therefore, merchants cannot as part of their regular
card acceptance procedures refuse to complete a purchase transaction because
a cardholder refuses to provide ID.

Brawker developer here. We noticed this happens from times to times, when the price moves too fast.
We're working on getting the transaction very fast, so you can trade without being annoyed by the exchange rate. We're working on safely accepting 0-conf transactions (we'll write a blog post about how we're doing it), and on a single page JavaScript app with Facebook-like notifications, and a live chat so you can find someone to do business with.
We're confident that with these tools, the volatility shouldn't matter because the transaction is fast enough.

For now, the only use cases I can think of are:
- If a shop uses a different currency and it ends up being cheaper using Coinbase / Circle than if your bank does the conversion
- Paying at shops that are Bitcoin only (which ones?)

"The best way to secure the users bitcoins is not holding them" is exactly what Brawker told and is working on since last year, using a different multisig wallet for every order
How it works:

You could try  and find an order from a shop that accepts PayPal, easy enough :)

As explained, the database stores the encrypted keys. Without the user password, you can't decrypt the key. It's protected against brute force with the scrypt algorithm.
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:23:24
Why would they implement a KYC thing and a preloaded wallet etc? Works for 0.1% of their users, and it's waaaay more cumbersome than the actual implementation.
You type in your CC information and you're done. Works for 99.99% of their users.
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:33:54
Considering MtGox had ~1 million accounts, I'm not that surprised. On the service I'm working for, I've noticed that Bitcoin users tend to create more accounts than average people.
I guess they're obviously talking about accounts, not users.

In Paris, probably 10% of people ever heard about NFC. But they all use it daily to take the metro.

This happens all the time. And every time, users are contacting the support, which is time consuming.
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:32:25
What's the point of this article?
I really can't believe a developer would develop a Bitcoin app without using hierarchical keys. It's so convenient.
"Hierarchical Deterministic Multisig" looks like a multi buzzword combo. The Multisig can't be deterministic since you can't know in advance where the 3 keys are coming from. Eg: you have 2 different users and someone for the arbitration, you know who they are, and their keys, once they all accepted to trade together.
And using Multisig while getting keys from seeds, or way better, master public keys, sound obvious.
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:55:58
If there is a way to get the multisig public/private keys from a single place, because it's deterministic, what's the point of using multisig?
This article makes no sense, it's just full of buzzwords.
EDIT: Thanks for the answers guys, but it's exactly what I wrote in my first post:


@_date: 2015-01-22 10:18:20
To implement multisig with JavaScript, we started with Bitcore but ended up using Bitcoinjs which was lighter and easier to use.
I'll check this new release. :)
@_date: 2015-01-01 11:19:48
Yes, but if the customer refuses to show his ID, you still have to accept their payment. What's the point, then?
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:57:19
You actually missed the point : there are no bitcoins store on the server.
The bitcoins are sent to a specific multisig transaction, in the Blockchain.
If you change the balance of the transaction in the database (which is only store to be displayed on the user interface), it won't change the amount locked in the Blockchain... You will only get the bitcoins from this multisig transaction.
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:42:50

Lol... Did you ever use Uber? You don't know the price of the ride before you get to the destination. Even if we imagine you would, it still wouldn't be as good as the current experience where all you have to do is enjoy the ride.

Well, you just described brawker.com :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:25:58
Just found 140k bitcoins that belong to Bitstamp. If you follow the address that has been audited by Mike Hearn in may, you end up on these addresses:
-  with 134k bitcoins
-  with 5k bitcoins
There are probably lots of other ones.
@_date: 2015-01-06 10:36:01
How does it work then?
If you're using a multisig wallet but own all the keys, I can't see the difference. I do agree that, depending on your implementation, it's more secure, but as long as you hold the keys it's centralized.
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:54:49
This thread is about Uber, not taxis. They never use cash.
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:38:25
What if it's empty? What if it's low? What's if the amount left is lower than the average price of your rides?
As far as I know, Braintree/Coinbase doesn't solve all these issues. Nor do they provide "preloaded wallets". So they'd have to write quite some code, become their own payment provider for this case, hire people, etc etc. 
It's not like the Bitcoin market is huge...
@_date: 2015-01-21 10:07:16
Oh, yes, you're right. I'll make sure we keep this in mind and work on a solution if the volatility keeps hurting our users. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-10 18:48:01
Brawker developer here.
Very etailed explanations are here: 
To make it very simple: 
You need to split the keys between the buyer, the seller, and you (the server). You then create a 2-of-3 multisig transaction.
If the hacker gains access to the server, he only has one key. That's not enough to steal the coins. The other keys are hashed/encrypted with the user password. The server don't know the password, and can't access the user keys, unless he knows the user password.
The trick is in how to login someone without knowing his password, it's explained in the provided link. :)

Seems like a hack, what if I'm away, want to book a return flight and notice that they offer a discount if you pay with bitcoin? Silly example, but all your coins should be highly accessible and secure easily.
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:49:10
Super cool actually, thanks! You still have no way to check their code and no tool to decrypt these keys by yourself if they get shutdown, but really cool
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:35:21
Well, no it would not be easy to hack.
On a not compromised computer, I can see two major attack vectors:
* Getting access to the service database: all the seeds/private keys are encrypted in a way that would be way too long to bruteforce, and let you plenty of time to move your coins
* Corrupting the frontend files to get your private keys when they're decrypted by yourself, on your browser: the chrome extension would check that the loaded code is the same as the code you can read on github (open source). If a hacker manages to change this, anyone could see it
It'd be easy as an exchange, and secure since no one can access your keys but you.

When using Amazon, you have 30 days to ask for a refund on the Gift Card you bought, if the Gift Card is not spent yet.
It's too easy, and legal, for someone to:
1. Buy a Gift Card for someone else
2. Get the bitcoins
3. Get a refund for the Gift Card
It's true for most online gift cards. We had to deal with this issue a lot when working on Brawker.
@_date: 2015-07-31 12:44:47

I partially agree with you. It depends on what you want to do, software is a big world.
For prototyping, you're right. For protocol development, you def need to learn a lot before doing anything...

Don't think you'll find a better answer. When trying to learn about a new topic, a good approach is to find a great general book, that'll serve as an entry point and help you figure out what's next for you to learn.

@_date: 2015-03-08 14:25:39
Because of all the fraudsters we all have to go through the KYC/AML processes. Because of all the scams, Bitcoin has a very bad reputation.
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:13:18
No it's definitely not.
Think of the Uber process again. They take care of the payment for you. You get in the car and enjoy your drive.
You'd have to preload a wallet, which brings a lot of issues (is it preloaded enough? etc). Implementing a wallet system, charging the user from his wallet etc, is definitely not a feature Stripe offers. And it's definitely not one line of code.
Uber is so successful with this process, do you really expect them to change the process to accept Bitcoin, that would create more issues than it solves?
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:13:50
Source? AFAIK, this never happened with Brawker.
If you're talking about Purse.IO, it's a different company, with different processes. It's like saying "Coinbase will get hacked because MtGox did get hack"
@_date: 2015-02-24 11:19:34
I can't think of any reason why Uber would accept Bitcoin. Their service and experience is great because they're able to charge your card. You don't need to prepay or care about anything. Fill you information the first time, and you're done.
With Bitcoin, you'd have to load a wallet, with an unknown amount: where are you going? How much will it be? No one knows
What if you load your wallet but want to do a very long ride? What if your wallet is loaded with an amount inferior than the average cost of your rides? What if they're annoyed by the regulators?
It would bring a lot of issues to Uber, and which one would it solve? They're doing pretty well so far.
@_date: 2015-02-07 22:44:23

@_date: 2015-02-16 20:00:35
Hello, Brawker developer here
I'm very sorry about what happened to you. I believe it was not a chargeback, but a refund. In most cases, canceling a gift card is as easy as sending an email to the service you bought it from. For example, you have 30 days to cancel an Amazon gift card.
The only way to make sure the user who sent you the gift card can't cancel it is to spend it. This way, no one gets screwed. The person who bought it can't ask for a refund, that's it.
We make our possible to protect users from such things. To release the escrow, you have to check the agreement that you received your items, or you spent your gift card (so it's no longer refundable)


From our FAQ:
