"Putting rich people on a pedestal" is what I wrote. Yes, money has been around since forever. I don't have a problem with money at all, but in its current form it can be one hell of a drug. Putting the pursuit of riches above everything else is not good, that's all I meant to say.

Yes, this is the stuff I was talking about (This, and the way he talks about his „poor“ father). I don‘t like how we as a society are putting rich people on a pedestal. money is just smoke and mirrors, and putting money above everything else by making it the highest goal in life is pure cancer... at least in my eyes. Hell, I‘m in it for the gains too, but I‘m not going to sacrifice my principles for them. I would rather throw it all away and become a traveling hobo. :I

This might be true in the US with their „You absolutely have to own a house before you are 25!“ mentality, but certainly not in Europe. Besides, most young folk owning houses in the US have taken up loans, have they not? If so, then the bank owns their house... more or less.

I totally agree with your last paragraph. That‘s what drew me to his videos. In a way it doesn’t matter if he fakes his personality for his videos... I get how you can still enjoy the result. 
I just feel that his video-personality totally clashes with the stories he tells about himself. Like that one time he picked up a local farmgirl in easter-europe and offered her a ride home, only to ask her for a blowjob and pay her 6$ for it - That‘s fucked up... He exploits girls and is proud of such „conquests“. I just can‘t take him seriously anymore.

Dollar Cost Averaging.
define a certain sum of money that you want to put into bitcoin and spread it out evenly over a certain timespan. This way price fluctuations don‘t affect you that much and all your purchases are for an „average price“ - The only thing that matters is that you buy in predetermined intervals and don‘t look at the price.
@_date: 2019-11-07 14:15:12
DCA your money and don‘t worry about a specific price. But don‘t wait years, start to DCA now and do it over a couple of months.

Stocks are great. However, I wouldn‘t think of investing in stocks at the moment... Everything is overextended and I believe the next crisis is on our doorstep.
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:04:27
haha. that sounds like a desperate attempt to stop people from throwing fiat into cryptoworld. However, even if BTC goes down hard and falls deeper than it is now (What I personally feel won‘t happen), it will never go to zero. 
There is also the fact that crypto is not only BTC and there are some projects out there, that have actual use-cases with hundreds of companies that are willing to pay for their services. Adoption is coming.
@_date: 2019-08-29 08:10:05
That‘s a given. Hence the „suggesting“ and „high probability“. I don‘t think it is delusional at all. If the patterns we are seeing are correlated with halvings (And there is a high probability that they are), then it‘s wise to assign a high probability to it happening again at the next halving.
But yes, as with all things in life... You never know until you know. I have my money on it happening again.
@_date: 2019-08-29 07:13:25
Once you take a derp-dive into the fundamentals behind Bitcoin, you learn to ignore price fluctuations like this. Bitcoins underlying pattern is suggesting much higher prices in the future. The probability of 100k+ in 2021 is very high. 
If anyone is interested, I would suggest you read this brilliant article on the Stock-to-Flow model of Bitcoin... It‘s a must read for everyone who owns some Bitcoin!
Here is the article I‘m referring to: 
—Edit: I accidentally wrote ‚derp-dive‘ instead of ‚deep-dive‘. That‘s staying in!

I‘m lucky to have a very supportive girlfriend and family. However, my friends are totally convinced that Bitcoin is a fad that‘s soon going to die. They truly think they know everything, even though much of what they say is false. I usually shrug it off...

Extremely good read, thank you! I knew about Stock-to-Flow, but it was good to read the original article.

When you look at the last two halvings, 55k is lowballing it.

Here is my worthless prediction: New ATH for the next two and a half years will be between May and October 2021 and we will be peaking at 250k.
@_date: 2019-10-01 16:34:21
Notice how Bitcoin tends to overshoot the S2F ration after every halving. We don't have enough data to accurately predict how the next halving is going to affect the price, but a reasonable butthole-estimate is 150k - 200k at the peak. As with all things Bitcoin, this is totally fucking speculative.
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:33:08
Yes, I agree with you. I think a fast paced rally to 20k within the next few weeks is not sustainable. We would be better off to consolidate between 10k and 15k over the next 6 months before slowly climbing higher at the beginning of next year. As things are going I wouldn‘t be surprised if we see lower prices soon... But I‘m wrong most of the time. :D
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:09:20
Bitcoins SF ratio and estimated halving dates. Good stuff.

Well, the same thing applies to gold. If I use gold as a store of value and my car breaks down when the gold-price is low... Too bad, I will make losses.

Same. Bought 2 BTC in 2014 for 200$ each and sold for 1000$ before the parabolic rise to 20k. Man, I was so bummed. But guess what... I learned from my mistake, made a plan and tried again. Looking good so far! Never underestimate Bitcoin.

Stock to flow model suggests 1 Million by 2025 or 2026. That doesn‘t mean it‘s going to happen, but I‘m going to bet on it.
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:45:30
I‘m in the same boat. On the one side I have the prospect of personal wealth coming my way, and on the other side we are in the middle of earth‘s sixth mass extinction - What is money worth if everything around us turns to shit? When people are dying by the millions because there is no water? When tens of millions of refugees are trying to cross borders to reach safety? When biodiversity plummets and ecological collapse is on our doorstep? 
Nothing. Bitcoin will not save us from the terrors of uncontrolled human expansion and greed. If Bitcoin brings you wealth... For god‘s sake, be humble!
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:23:16
I think a correction to 12000 is a real possibility... A direct route to 8500 feels wrong. I‘m betting we are going to touch 11000 to 12000 and then we will go down to 9000ish. There is money to be made!

Apparently 75% (or some number like that) of Bitcoin mining is powered by renewables.
@_date: 2019-06-23 11:35:56
Sure, as a person. Scientists are telling us that all of that will end this century, if we don‘t change radically. Yes, the economy has been growing for decades, but the fact of the matter is that we are destroying the natural world at an alarming rate... We will not survive an ecological collapse. 
You tell me to stop complaining, but I‘m just someone who listens to scientists... This is not complaining, this is a warning. We are destroying this planet, and all the money in the world is not going to save us if we don‘t change. That‘s a fact... Nothing can grow forever, Bitcoiners should know that.
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:11:27
Because we have seen nothing yet. The true peak is probably going to happen somewhere in 2021 (100k - 300k), so this is just a smaller bump in a longer run-up. I expect us to crack 10k in the next few days and conquer 20k at the end of this year or early next year. 
This is all pulled from my ass and worth nothing, but I‘m betting money on it by buying more BTC.

With things like SpaceX Starlink on the horizon, even that strategy becomes unfeasible. When you can access the internet from everywhere by just connecting with satellites, there is no connection to cut. They would have to shoot down 12000 satellites to kill Starlink. :)

For god‘s sake! Read a few books about the topic or talk to actual scientists if you mistrust the media. The consensus on the growing climate crisis among scientists is 97% ... It‘s laughable to suggest that all scientists get paid to scare the public. By whom?! The opposite is the case. Oil companies are eager to find morally corrupt scientists to pay in order to distort data and twist the facts... Luckily only very few scientists are ready to do that. Those companies have a true motive to uphold the status quo.
We have seen nothing yet. We have to change the way we produce energy, heat and food, and we have to revolutionize transportation. There is no other option!
@_date: 2019-12-11 15:51:44
This. It‘s nice to imagine a future where overpopulation is not a problem, but right now our merciless expansion coupled with greed and consumerism is fucking up the planet pretty bad. We need functioning ecosystems, or else our society will collapse in an instant. We think of nature as this separate thing that we can exploit for our own gain, but we completely miss the point... We‘re it. We came out if it and are it. Without nature we are fucked, because destroying it is akin to cutting off our arms and legs and bleeding to death. It makes no sense. We‘ll be our own doom if we don‘t change our ways.

I‘m not saying that BTC will go to 100k+ necessarily, but a 100 $ prediction would mean BTC is clinically dead. Sure, that could happen, but I find that outcome rather unlikely at this point.
That being said, every prediction should be taken with a grain of salt. It‘s betting on the price, nothing else.

That is definitely a smart decision. I tend to forget some of my funds on exchanges... The vast majority of coins is on a ledger, but I have to force myself to periodically transfer all the DCA‘d amounts that are sitting on exchanges. Laziness is dangerous.
