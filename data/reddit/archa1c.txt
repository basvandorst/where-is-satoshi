Understood. 
Perhaps counter-intuitively, I tend to give paid apps more consideration because I assume the developer truly values the effort they put into it, and don't want to subject their supporters to ads.
I think a $0.99 is a very fair price for your app once you get out of alpha/beta.

The value of Bcash and Bgold didn't come form nowhere. People exchanged other tokens or fiat for those tokens at a particular exchange rate.

I hate jumping on old threads, but wanted to contribute here.
While I agree that GBTC is not a solution for people wanting to invest in Bitcoin, it is still a viable investment opportunity for the short-mid term.
It's not about owning BTC, it's about growing your pre-tax money.
As it stands, someone who invested in GBTC 7 months ago would see a 10x return on that money. 
They then have the option of moving that money into a more stable and/or diversified portfolio, or continue to ride the BTC wave.
It's not binary. Someone can invest in GBTC and also own BTC. The benefits to owning BTC are obvious if you believe in blockchain.
The benefits to GBTC are that it integrates with current investment paradigms, and exists in fiat, which can be invested pre-tax as part of an IRA/401k.

Relax friends. Once the BCash and S2X backers have pumped and dumped, things will settle back down.
Yeah, BCash will linger a bit higher than it was before (even 2x the old norm), but this BCash rally doesn't seem to be sustainable. Many reputable experts believe that Bitmain and others are merely artificially driving the price up by putting more hash power behind cash.
This is akin to shopping at your own store to inflate sales numbers. It's a short term tactic to artificially inflate the numbers.

I don't consider you an idiot if you can afford the loan payments quickly.
Bitcoin really is always best bought NOW.
I don't see the major issue with getting more now rather than less later, as long as you aren't putting yourself in fincial peril with the loan.
I took an early withdrawal penalty on $12,000 from my employer IRA. After taxes and the early penalty, I only had 9,000 to invest in bitcoin.

I disagree (and I am very bullish on Blockchain).

The reality is we simply don't know how cryptocurrency will grow, and whether it is inevitable that it will increase in value and maintain that value for the long-term.
I'm betting it will, but I'm not betting everything...

Somebody bought the dip...

It was fucking brilliant.
The MGS ringtone for the Vitalik call was hilarious.

Currency is whatever you want it to be, as long as there is trust and agreed-upon value.

Triple down!

Then they should be consistent with the language in this message.
Otherwise it appears to be in error. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:05:56
That's the point

Hey! We're trying to have fun here!

FLY EAGLES! FLY!

It's also quite possible that the encumbent prominent coins/tokens (BTC, ETH, LTC etc.) a will bubble and burst, being replaced by a not-yet created blockchain.

China bans, I buy.

9 hours is a minimal time commitment to learn about an entirely new protocol.
The term "accessible" is relative. But all you really need to say to someone who is complaining about the accessibility of Bitcoin is   
You really can't mess it up if all you do is convert some fiat to BTC/ETH/LTC.
From there, you can do more, or not. You can simply leave it in your coinbase wallet (albeit, less secure, it's still a valid option).
Everything has a trade-off when dealing with accessibility vs. security.

They threw in some pots and pans too. So it was really quite a fair deal.
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:34:17
I buy whatever I can with BTC, then I immediately buy more BTC to cover it :)
I was to increase the market share of cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:51:54
That is pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:00:07
Who? OP or Xapo?
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:54:08
If they prefer it to the other cold wallets, why not?
An expensive cold wallet is still better than no cold wallet.

If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam than I do about being rich.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:00:18
We thank you for your sacrifice!

The message below "Bitcoin is Beter" is in English, which makes the whole thing confusing and/or in error. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:53:37
That's how you know it's still a good time to buy
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:33:54
We need to know what Bitcoin is doing even when we cannot access the blockchain!
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:41:24
They'll say this until fiat is driven to zero, then they'll play catch up wishing they had bought in years earlier.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:07:53
While the rest of the message is in English :(
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:34:54
Of course China isn't going to ban Bitcoin outright.
They are almost certainly developing their own state-owned blockchain currency, and are merely setting the stage for that by thinning the herd now.
