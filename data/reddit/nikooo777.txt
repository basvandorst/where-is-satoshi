thank you for stating that. 
I have been involved in LBRY since august last year and never actually lost my wallet. Upgraded throughout  all their versions, and while they were buggy as hell, i never experienced losses of my coins.

I'm not continuing this discussion. You're obviously a troll or just blind. 
Have a good day

What are you talking about? He has no issues talking english. 
Besides, he never meant to support LBRY, he just semi-randomly picked LBC as a coin to play with, messed up big times and complained to the devs. 
Feel free to steer clear if you think this is somehow our fault, probably better to avoid other dramas such as the ones we're debating currently.

i'm just going to leave this here:
I understand that people might not want to believe the above, so fortunately all tags and changes are logged to github:
so one can feel free to navigate the code and confirm that the wallet was never or could never be overwritten by the application.
Let me note that we're still in early beta and never did the team ask for people to support the coin, rather the application and its development.

search his history and my history. 
We tried helping him for hours, apparently even offered him a compensation for HIS OWN MISTAKES and he refused it. This guy is just a lost cause.
