My question is how did they find the server? I suppose once they got their hands on the server the rest of proving it was him was just a matter of work.

I've had to deal with him before when I used bitinstant because customer support would ignore me, he was no better and reply to my complaints with just quirkyness. Although he always did fix the issue eventually.

I was about to say, a nonce is basically a random number.

but what would the newest small denomination be called? satoshi-satoshi?

800$ will be childs play in a year from now. BTC will go way back up.

This guy is a troll, what does bitcoin do to affect him? Its illegal use in drugs and money laundering? well good thing thats already illegal. Not sure what hes trying to do with his crusade here.

sometimes you have to face fear head on, he should of wrote "if you strike me down now, I will become more powerful than you could ever imagine" of course the judge would throw the book at him but we all know the power of drugs and how the war on them are going.

The pharmas don't want the addicts to actually die though because that hurts their profits so they make drugs like Buprenorphine which block the opiate receptor but also activate it thus negating any other opiates. So addicts stay addicts but also alive.

but bitcoin uses tcp/ip? and www is what? world wide web? or just http?

back in my day... I had my own pool called asspenny.com and it actually mined about a dozen blocks or so and every block it created it had the message "mined asspennies" or something like that. Now a couple years later the couple hundred of bitcoins have been spread across the network and so if you've used bitcoin there is a good chance you've touched my asspennies. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:20:44
well how else are you going to know if they are guilty. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:20:27
sounds like he had some bad lawyers?
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:24:29
plus isnt the sentencing less for attempted murder vs narcotics conspiracy?
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:10:23
he might be a good lawyer but the way you put it sounds like he messed up.

I mean you make it sound like being hacked is rare I've been hacked a few times and had bitcoin stolen (hackers are clever as fuck) I don't think it would be too difficult to implant some doubt he was framed which should give him some room to work with. In fact I just got an email from bitcoin talk saying they got hacked again and I have to change my shit again...
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:58:14
exactly... like the government proved he was guilty... using computer voodoo? I don't understand how there can't be a retrial.

there are wireless keyboards that use encryption.

My question is how did they find the server? 
page 21 they just say they were able to identify him because they found the server. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 15:55:39
yeah you cant really eli3 bitcoin other than "its computer internet money". Most people I tell about bitcoin wonder how its secure but explaining how ellipitcal curve cryptography and hash functions and peer to peer distributed databases and macroeconomics work is hard for most people of any age to understand. 
Satoshi was a smart mofo

Its theoretically possible but its never going to happen. Some one could theoretically infect all the machines that make up over 51% of mining power and take control. Its easier to just infect one persons computer and get their private keys and steal their bitcoins. 


yes, but only the bitcoin developers can. you can view the source code 


The bitcoin devs will pull the change request and release an official update but in order for the change to take effect most of the people that power the bitcoin network will have to update their servers/clients as well otherwise the code change won't work. 


If say a bitcoin dev becomes greedy and puts some malcious code into the official release, its open source and so people will find it and not download/compile/run the release. So no matter what changes get made it still has to get adopted by most of the network owners.

cash, instant transactions, doesn't require electricity or internet. idk it would be hard to replace cash.

fuck 100$ for 12 roses?
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:28:44
lool actually it sounds like I had it easy, btc early adopters won out. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 23:58:10
anyone know what pool or address its mining to? It would be interesting to see how much money they are making off this. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 04:26:28
why dont banks like bitcoin?

Back in my day the difficulty was 16 million and I could actually mine my very own blocks and back then blocks were 50 btc.
