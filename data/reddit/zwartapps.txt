Coinbase..... I'm unable to buy Ethereum today as "high volume of traffic" ��

My Hungarian isn't very good.... But it says: Buy and HODL

Strange, with their fees they're unable to handle "high volume of traffic"....

Just read the article (I'm half Dutch), the arguments are funny and stupid. Smells like fear of all the governments and banks (who rule the world at the moment) that they can lose control of the world....just buy and hodl! (waiting for a dippie ��)

Put some speculaas with them ��

Coinbase, with your high fees, when I want to buy Ethereum at low price today, there is "high volume of traffic".... Really with those fees you're unable to have better resources for handling your traffic?

Wow, they also have an EA one - &gt; €

Some years ago I "earned" like $12 from faucets, then I thought it was time wasting (2015), I didn't had the equipment to mine, always had a medium PC. Now it's worth $125, but still having transfer issues with Blockchain (not letting me transfer the whole amount on my imported address, that's why I went to Coinbase) and I bought €100 in Ethereum on Coinbase ��. Now I'm waiting for a dip to buy some more BTC. I'm still learning

The issue is that why they don't let me transfer the maximum amount all in once..... Just bit by bit $6 or $7 at once with high fees (what is affected by the market I understand that) and  ot my $100 in one time

I bought €50 of Ether today, an amount I can lose, got back to the coins since I left 2 years ago and had $12 from faucets which is now about $112. Although Blockchain wallet won't let me transfer the coins in the imported address to the main wallet ��. So I hope you didn't use those guys as wallet

I'm happy to hear that, and I hope you will succeed with your business ��

Cool guide ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:39:52
I'm liking my recently buyed Ether coins ��
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:39:05
I'll try to be more patient...... Wanna buy more BTC and Ethereum.

Yes, there are some nice forums, Google will show you the "best"

I would change bank, not crypto service. And tell them why you change ��!
