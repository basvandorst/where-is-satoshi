Thought that CZ is selling one of his hideouts at first.

Kill bezos. If you cheer for Amazon you dont get   any of the concepts why this started. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 07:05:06
great, you jinxed it
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:15:47
About half an hour in and it's way better than the 4 horsemen branding made me think it will be. Pretty objective, imo.
e: I'm also happy that they go after the multinationals. Very refreshing after seeing so many idiots cheer for the tech giants chiming in. That's not why we started this shit for.
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:04:05
Oh you meant it that way. I see.   
I still have a tiny glimpse of hope left, that we can push past that tho. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 17:44:06
Could you explain your reasoning? Because I think it actually accelerates the whole thing.
@_date: 2018-09-07 22:34:35
Ppl looking at me in the subway, cuz i laughed so hard. Good stuff. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 10:44:38
"layers"  
we'll see
@_date: 2018-09-06 17:15:36
Next big crash and guillotines are all over the place again. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 04:49:53
Or the ecology for that point.
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:30:03
well, that escalated quickly
@_date: 2018-08-28 01:52:06
You saw the debate about scaling between Colin and Jimmy, too, I suppose.  
Tbh Jimmy came along as pretty rude.
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:51:10
If it's lead by a few big players/corps and the community is celebrating that goldmann and so on are getting in, there's rly not much counter-culture left

Highend gaming PC mid december, renewed VPN subscription lately

OMG I can't fucking breathe after digging into this. THANK YOU RNR
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:04:06
those times are long gone lol
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:20:22
No plz, oh god no
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:40:09
Yeah, wasted a lot of time looking into that when I was booking a trip to Amsterdam :(
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:27:10
And that is the exact opposite of what I wanted cryptocurrency to be.   
But username checks out, I guess.
@_date: 2018-07-04 12:29:00
Implying that there's still as man cypherpunks involved, given the massive sell-outs in the space  as well as the new influx of users. My invested friends just dont give a shit about imutability or censorship resistance. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:20:13
That kind of fundamentalism is totally shortsighted lol.
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:49:28
So you're a downright fascist. Got it.
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:30:08
I understand the government part, but I don't understand the second one. At all.
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:02:12
\&gt;But realize that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness.    
Something a lot of people never learn. WAs worth the read just because of this sentence.

Props for Yanis. DiEM25 ftw.
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:31:19
I was going to discuss with you, but you're more dense than a neutron star, wow
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:05:26
C'mon avaiable jobs are already heavily gated and utterly hard to come by. The fish analogy just can't be held up anymore.   
Also financing an UBI need to obviously be done via taxing high income individuals as well as companies. It's a fucking joke what internationals pay. It would also come with an entire restructuring of the public sector as well as the elimination of certain subsidies. Managing the unemployed workforces on a gov lvl is nearly as expensive as to just give out the money.  
The blockchain might just be the right tool to be able to implement this.
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:17:34
The benefit is, that the economy doesn collapse under it's own inequality. Pitchforks will be raised soon and rightfully so.
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:26:41
So many compassionate and thinking people in this thread. lol
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:25:45
Who's talking about hobos? Do you even know what an UBI is?
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:38:41
Fidor is very cryptofriendly, too. Kraken APi integration is in Beta atm.

I am involved. Recently managed to organize an appartment for an Iraqi guy, who came 2 years ago and is now one of my best friends. Also living in what some would call a No-go area probably. Never had any fucking issue.

Most I got out of skating was a fakie bigspin down 5 :(

When EGQT or whatever it was called? When IBAN? Signed up in the first 5k or so. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:59:10


Using this kind of language, but I'm the totalitarian. Okay.
First class economic knowledge you got there. Btw judging by your words you're the one petting his AR-15 to go "hunt" some "leftists". 
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:24:40
Every man for himself. Everything is a fight. I get your point. You don't even think about anything else but yourself.
@_date: 2018-07-02 01:02:00
Thx for that comment, reminded me why I got in in the first place.
@_date: 2018-07-02 00:29:45
Wow, cool dude. He's right about sell-out stuffs tho. Was really irritated when I met some people at one of those after-convention rooftop parties.  
Will research this guy a lot more from here on.

So is healthcare, right? /s
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:36:55
alts exist. do I get banned now?
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:13:05
Then on the other hand, we sit here and basically buidl the infrastructure for that to happen. I honestly hope we handle this tech the right way for fucking once, because I don't want to wake up someday like a FB engineer thinking I helped build/promote a dystopia.
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:23:04
They are already here. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:40:04
The 80's called. They want their Steven Seagull movie audience back.
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:15:13
Well how is it free cash? It's not like they start printing money to finance an UBI. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 12:55:34
"It doesn't affect my daily life at All"
Pure consumerist mindset. Not considering the hell that Facebook was end of december. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:34:49
Someone on fox news said it, probably.
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:43:22
When large parts of the human population are forced out of generating/saving up any wealth beyond living  day to day due to job shortage how the fuck do you think societal problems should be solved as long as capitalism is the predominant economic system?  
This is starting to eat itself.
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:32:06


Never desired to descend into barbarian lands.
e: Nor coorperate with fascists who consider human beeings garbage.
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:05:47
No. Not savings. Net income.  
Also from restructuring public institutions and forcing multinationals to play by the same rules as everyone else.  
You do realize, that even in a fully peer to peer economy you do need to have actual peers you can do business with, do you?

More like social isolation.
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:58:11
Well which specific incident do you have in mind?
@_date: 2018-07-11 08:58:30
Nobody does anything to right-wingers, cuz police are undermined by them.

Not everyone is techsavvy enough to run a Tails VM on a custom build Linux distri y'know.
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:02:03
I can so picture this in my head.

Absolutely hopeless.
