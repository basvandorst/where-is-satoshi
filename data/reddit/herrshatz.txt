Gawd I can't wait for this to happen.  r/ShillCoins are getting on my last nerve.

Thanks! Excited about getting started with this.  Great resources you sent.

2018 for BTC will be huge if this keeps up.

Gladly. How?

but he doesn't regret buying BTC the same day he made that statement.

Great explanation. Seriously.

Returning to sound money will help the poor and downtrodden far more than allowing them to bypass a bank to buy their coffee.

I agree.  Those who do not care about the tech / economics of bitcoin will suffer the consequences unfortunately as they watch their ICOs/alts go to zero.

"Bitcoin used to allow people to start a business without needing to go through government regulation and opening a bank account. You just make some stuff and people scan your QR code and pay you. You don't need to deal with change. There is no physical money that someone can steal by breaking into your house." ----all of this you can still do.  Just give it time.  Running a full node, or being able to, on a small basic computer will enable far more sovereignty than increasing the block size (in the long run).  Let's just be patient and give the community time.  It's in the works.

In response to scenario 1: you don't need a jet airplane to drive down a residential street to move five blocks.  You just drive or walk.  You don't need the level of security provided by bitcoin to spend $100 at starbucks.  Fees will likely come way down, but never to the point of visa or other existing payment systems.  That's not the innovation bitcoin provides.  When you start talking about larger sums of money, settling anywhere in the world, permission less, and without gov's abillity to print more (devalue) the currency, THAT is the innovation.

You should be able to refill the channel if the discrepancy is not worth it. It's not worth it to buy insurance on your thermos to carry your coffee, that level of security is simply not needed.  But for larger transactions (think global settlements), a few thousand dollars in discrepancy may simply be attributed to the fee of using a network as secure and reliable as bitcoin.

It wasn't just people who are tech savvy, but more so, people who understood the concept of sound money (i.e. goldbugs, austrian economics sympathizers, etc).

 This is probably the worst advice a person can listen to. NEVER put all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket "COULD" have gotten you rich.  Take a deep breath, think, relax.
