Great!  Thanks.

Again, you could be right.  Failed sounds a bit harsh, given that I am still working on it. Maybe failing is more apt. I do have a day job, and I recognize that I need help if I want the subreddit to be useful, which is why I made the post.  I'm guessing from the tone of your replies that you are not interested, but if I'm wrong, let me know.

Thanks.  I am working on the campaign.  It is a legitimate, authorized Doctors Without Borders fundraising campaign.  You can find a verification letter [here]( (and it has been [posted on the campaign website](
I understand someone could fake a letter to post on the Internet, so anyone who has any lingering doubts should feel free to contact the MSF point person (and author of the letter), Charlie Kunzer, at charlie.kunzer

You do now.  Thanks for the donation.  The campaign has received donations as small as 1 DOGE (ok, so that amount seems a little silly to me), but in total more than 750,000 DOGE has been donated so far.

Yes, that is payment processing from Causevox, which hosts the site and runs the payment transactions.  However, Bitcoin transactions go through Coinbase and do not incur those fees.  All the more reason to donate Bitcoin.

It is not a registered charity, it is actually a Doctors Without Borders authorized fundraiser and Doctors Without Borders is the charity.  The MSF contact person is Charlie Kunzer and she can be reached at Charlie.Kunzer for verification.
All the other information on the campaign should be at   If you have further questions, the doctor running the campaign is also on reddit and you can PM her at There is also a subreddit at @_date: 2014-10-20 21:01:55
To follow up on this, to provide additional peace of mind, the campaign had Doctors Without Borders send it written confirmation of its A Day Without Touch's status as a confirmed fundraiser for the organization.  It was posted on the blog today (bottom of the page at  and includes [this copy of the letter](
Of course, letters can be faked, yada yada, so if anyone still has concerns the best course is to contact the author (MSF point person) directly--that is the same information I provided previously, but it also is repeated in the letter.

Reasonable question.  I'm looking for mods that will be active on the subreddit and want mod-level responsibility.  As I said, this is my first subreddit.  My take on it is that mods are not only useful to serve as watchdogs but can also be good for making a subreddit more active and useful. They can help grow the site.

Causevox hosts the site and runs payment processing for credit card transactions and charges fees.  Bitcoin donations are not run that way and do not incur Causevox fees.
As far as verifying the whole thing, the campaign has a point person at MSF who is their fundraising outreach person.  Her name is Charlie Kunzer and she can be reached at Charlie.Kunzer  I thought I put that in my last post but if not, sorry.

A Day Without Touch is a Doctors Without Borders authorized campaign.  The MSF contact person is Charlie Kunzer and she can be reached at Charlie.Kunzer for verification.
This fundraiser differs from general giving to MSF in that A Day Without Touch is a challenge fundraiser that gets people to spread the word and raise more money by taking the "no touch" challenge and then posting and writing about it.  The aim is to help the cause go viral (no pun intended) and expand the base of MSF contributors. The origins of the campaign and other information are at the website: 
Bitcoin donations are particularly great because they do NOT incur Causevox fees.

thanks for your donation!  The campaign has already raised almost $1,000 just in bitcoin.  
I just logged in and saw the various discussions in this thread about whether it is legit.  It is.  The MSF contact person is Charlie Kunzer and she can be reached at Charlie.Kunzer for verification.
I myself don't run the campaign, but I am working on it and helping co-moderate the subreddit at I hope everyone continues to get the word out to help it hit its goal of raising $500K for MSF by the end of the year.
