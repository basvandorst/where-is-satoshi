As long as you have that recovery key/seed in safe storage, you don't need anything else.
I suggest you do what I did (and what Armory also suggests): 
-Create an offline wallet
-Sent a very small amount of BTC to it
-Delete the wallet and every file associated with it (personally, I completely wiped the OS and reinstalled Ubuntu)
-Enter the recovery key to set up the offline wallet yet again
-Try to send that small amount of BTC back to a hot wallet
-Breathe in relief as you recovered all your wallet contents from a completely destroyed (simulated) hard drive.
-Create a new offline wallet
It works, but it's nice to know for a fact it works after you've done it yourself.

I can't say I've ever been huge fan of it.  It's just too close to the dollar symbol for my tastes.

Right, that's what I figured, and I agree.  Those parts of marriage aren't all that controversial or hotly debated like the legal and religious parts, though, which is why I brought only those two up.

In all the example pictures I don't see any option for bitcoin.  
Setup payment type:
Credit Card
Prepaid Card
I wonder how the bitcoin integration works...

The poster gets to pay at a discount, they say anywhere from 10-20%, so that's the advantage.
The advantage from the other side is they get to buy bitcoins without going through an exchange or other bank account linked method.
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:32:02
I think the issue of 100% instant confirmation, and chargebacks - while related - are 2 different issues.  Credit cards and paypal are still 100% instant confirmation.  Bitcoin just has the advantage of no chargebacks happening at some point in the future.
There just doesn't seem to be any real incentives to get the average joe to spend bitcoins at POS merchants, and those are the types of users that could really help create wide spread adoption.

That's not true.  The Federal government had little to do with it, other than turning a blind eye to the outright fraud the big banks were committing.  The big banks fund every condidate that has ever sat in office, so they are the ones in control in this case.
The big banks were driven by profit to sell bundles of mortgages (mortgage backed securities) which contained high risk, shitty mortgages along with the good ones, and packaged them as an A+ super safe investment.  When those mortgages started defaulting, as high risk ones tend to do, it created a cascade that destroyed the financial system, and a lot of honest peoples pension/retirement funds who thought they were investing in safe funds.
All because the big banks were making a shit ton of money on it.
The only thing regulation ever does, at least in our current system, is solidify control of the current gate keepers to keep up-and-comers out of their business.

Keep up the good work, Jason!
(and to be picky, "more than 3.5 million people will be homeless this year -- that's 1 in 200 Americans" bugged me.  3.5 million divided by 314 million population is 1 in roughly 90 Americans.  Much worse than the article claims)

"Scorched Earth with replace-by-fee and 2-of-2 instant confirmation like GreenAddress.it are two interesting ways"
Can you please elaborate briefly on that?  After briefly searching those terms, I couldn't find anything helpful.

2 truths:   
1.  68% of statistics are made up.

Absolutely, and I hope everyone who listens can donate at least a little bit.  He puts a crap ton of time and effort into his podcasts.
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:49:29
True, good point.  You'd have to look at a more long term chart to take those transactions into effect.  Volume doesn't change with them, it's just bigger orders less often, and lots of little orders off-chain.

Lack of having to go through a centralized service to buy your bitcoins, and any fees and loss of anonymity that comes with exchanges.

Treating it as a property doesn't make sense, true, but it's also not a currency in the traditional government view of currency.  It's something completely different than anything that's come before - let's fight to get it's own rules that it deserves instead of pegging it into the currency hole!

I have an Android, but good to know.

How many foreign currencies out there can currently support an entire contract/3rd party asset/ecosystem directly on top of the currency itself for all sorts of non financial related applications?  None, because cryptocurrencies are very unique.
Yes they have similar qualities as other currencies, but how do you tax millions of microtransactions where people go back and forth between different user created assets, and any other transaction that requires a tiny bit of bitcoins to be spent?
If you only tax when going from bitcoin to dollars, that makes sense, but right now that's not how it works.  If I'm in the US and use Euros to buy a new car, you can bet the gov. is still going to want its tax money.  That becomes much more complicated with bitcoin, where you (one person) can go back and forth between assets hundreds of times a day.
That's what needs special laws, and not being pegged into the general currency hole.

We can hate on marriage all we want - that's not the point of what is going on here.  The point is that marriage exists, whether we like it or not, and there are very real legal consequences for being married (or not).
This is just one attempt at a baby step in the direction of getting marriage out of the hands of the goverment.  Let the 'special, sanctified' portion of it belong to the religions, and let the legal aspect of it move over to private (as in, not goverment/publicly owned) areas, like the blockchain, where most other contracts can live as well.
Or we can waste our time trying to banish the very institution of marriage.  Good luck with that!

Lots of people try to peg the price and health of bitcoin (at least in part) to the daily transaction volume.  Many point this ever-increasing stat as proof that bitcoin is doing fine.
With all the bitcoin 2.0 applications coming out, like counterparty, mastercoin, and everyone else who uses the bitcoin network as their backbone, aren't there just ever-increasing transactions that have nothing to do with buying and selling?  How can anyone point to that statistic as worthwhile?  Is there a way to easily sift out the buying/selling transactions from the 2.0 application transactions?
@_date: 2014-10-13 16:54:19
The first step in using bitcoins for daily life is actually being able to use them for daily life.  Just because it's not as easy as using fiat now, just means the innovation for doing so hasn't arrived yet.
Gotta start somewhere...

In the spirit of the 'why 10 minute blocks question', how can we bitcion supporters say that bitcoin is low/no transaction fee at instant speed?  The transaction fee might be true, for now, but if only the initial confirmation is at instant speed and you have to wait 10 mins, 20 mins, or even hours for a truly large transaction, how can we claim that it is better than paypal or credit cards for merchant transactions, which are essentially 100% confirmed within seconds?

The way I understand it, the discount is from the bid by the user on the other end.  If I really want to buy bitcoins, I will accept less cash (10% less) than the guy who doesn't want those bitcoins as much as I do.  
It's not the electric company offering the discount.

How hard could it be for the algorithm to take into account a long, fraud-free history with a user?  Especially one with a very regular buying schedule?

All good points.
I don't think there is any question bitcoin can be a vastly superior option for international transfers, both in fees and time.
When it comes to merchants with POS, in person transactions at higher prices than just your coffee and beer purchases, I'm finding it hard to convince them it's in their best interest.  The lack of chargebacks is one of the few selling points compared to the alternatives.

I had never heard of that happening before, interesting.  I guess processessing credit card transactions is something I need to know more about.

Now that you edited that previous post, I see what you were asking.
Circle is still a centralized way to buy bitcoins.  Brawker is just another method to buy bitcoins online in a peer to peer fashion.  The only other way I know of to do that is localbitcoins.com (I'm sure there are other ways, but I don't know any).  So if you are very anti-centralized methods of getting bitcoin, this will hold value for you.

That falsely implies that nobody ever loses US Dollars (or whatever your national currency is) due to theft, or human error.
I bet that percentage is a lot higher for the standard fiat currencies.

Thanks for the responses.  I'm not trying to avoid anything in particular, other than being a sloppy bitcoin user.  I follow the new-address-for-every-transaction best practice, but I was just wondering how much information can be gleaned from one single address.
How would a wallets master public key ever be found in the course of normal transactions?  (ie:  not from an attack that could also find one's private key)

It's not a crime if you have the right evidence to suspect a crime.  That's the whole point in this case - they got the evidence AFTER they hacked the servers.
And now that we have the Snowden documents, we know law enforcement has been doing exactly that for awhile now.  
I guess that's a pretty massive fight to pick, though, so I could see why the defense might shy away from that.

Deterministic wallet question:  If I know one of your addresses in your deterministic wallet (let's pretend I know what wallet you are using), can I know all the other addresses in that wallet, and see a total number of bitcoins in your wallet?
Likewise if you have an older school wallet (non deterministic), is it possible or easy to determine all other addresses in that wallet?  (my first thought here is no, but I'm not 100% on that)
Thanks in advance

I thought the whole trial was originally about that 4th amendment issue, and was why we were all supposed to find this trial extremely important.  The precedent set would have been awful for privacy.
So the defense quickly just ran away from that 4th amendment defense?
