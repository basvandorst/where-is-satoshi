I am an active trader on GDAX with an new account access restriction that has occurred on a day I have USD deposits posting and limit orders in place. I know this exchange is short on charting basics, bell, whistles and timely execution but c'mon let's keep the basic functionality in place.

The business will not survive at this level of support. It took one week to tell me to change my "Location" and upload an id. The instruction to upload the ID was inaccurate and in complete. On shore. This takes an hour. Result: An error occurred. Please contact GDAX support.

Except this is only about keeping the commoners yuan in China. Mainland elites have been using Hong Kong invoicing and Bitcoin for capital flight for years.   
"As far as official statements go, Bitcoin itself is not banned in China. Owning, using, and — most importantly — mining bitcoin should technically not be affected by the published guidelines."
