Maybe I'm not reading this right, but if you can take out 10k per day, wouldn't it only take you 20 days to get 200k? Where is the other 55 days? And then 15 million would take you 1500 days, far less than 16 years. 
I'm not understanding

It would be easier for people to invest in. Instead of needing to turn your fiat into BTC, then back into fiat again, you could easily just trade BTC along side all of your other ETFs and stocks. It would remove that barrier for people who are unsure or unwilling to do what we do now.

Had never heard of Polestar until now, looked it up, and I don't expect much from them. Mainly because, it's not in the same market. It still has a combustion engine...

Is that what the government does with seized coins? Do they auction them off like other seized assets? I always assumed the government wasn't good enough at this new technology and lost them to the ether

legally, you're supposed to "remain in control of the vehicle at all times" but if you have autopilot, why would you? As for the pull over, the car will give you little notices when either it feels like it can't safely do all the work, or if it feels like you aren't paying attention. You just give the wheel a tiny shake (in the dead zone of the wheel, you don't actually move the car) and it says "ok, you're still here, carry on"

That's my life...I've sat and watched bitcoin, and every ATH I think "Damn, should have gotten in, oh well" and I fantasize. I'm going to start getting in now, fuck it

It's a currency, with a physical amount of coins available, that have to have actual labor (computer labor) in the process of retrieving them. This first part gives them their value. The second part is our acceptance of them as a currency, making them valuable.

Just remember, people can regret selling their coins years ago, like the guy who bought the pizzza, but it's because people sold their coins that it's doing this. If everyone held it, it wouldn't go up. You're part of the solution
