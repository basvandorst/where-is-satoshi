An extra node can never hurt. Turning it off or on shouldn't affect any other peers communicating with it as they will just time out and move on to the next node in their list.
Even if you run the node for a few hours you are still helping decentralize the network and speed up propagation of transactions.

This is paycoin 2.0.
gawminers was insolvent and created paycoin
Bfx is insolvent so it creates bfxcoin.
Gawminers promised a $20 floor.
Bfx is promising a $1 floor.
These jokesters still have over $10m in funds they could give back to the customers whose money it actually is.
They would rather give it to lawyers so they can keep their company lambos and ferraris and not have to declare bankruptcy and have their assets get liquidated.

I was wrong, I though Circle wasn't based in the US but it is based in Masachussets. As far as I know Bitcoin online gambling is unregulated and so illegal in the US.
A good example is Seals with clubs which was a very popular poker site whose operator got raided Because he resided in the US. Also many gambling sites do not accept US players.
You should buy bitcoins from an exchange which doesn't reside in the US. Bitfinex, OKCoin, BTCC are all reputable exchanges which reside in China. The sketchy part might be wiring the money to a Chinese bank account.

Bfx is breaching securities laws by issuing tokens and promising a certain value without registering with the SEC. 
Bfx has committed a crime by embezzling its customers deposits.
Bfx has committed a crime by false advertising where it suggests that it is the worlds most secure exchange.
Bfx has committed a crime by forcing an arbitrary haircut on its customers funds without a full audit, that's called fraud.
Bfx employees already don't have a job, the longer they keep customer funds hostage and try to keep their failure of a company afloat, the harder the alphabet agencies will come and tear down that whole circus. 
When a company is insolvent the LAW is to proceed with bankruptcy, not commit securities fraud.
Why are you defending bfx? Customers have a right to THEIR money, whole and full. No bullshit haircut.

Unfortunately that is the complete opposite when it comes to selling bitcoins to companies like circle and coinbase. They will ask you and your mothers brother sister about your employment history, social media information, and your firstborn child.

Most likely no, but coinbase might have an issue with the KYC/AML policies of the seller which accepts tumbled coins. It really is iffy and comes down to the fact if it's worth it for the seller to risk getting his account closed on coinbase.

It doesn't matter if the abc boys start analyzing the blockchain now or in 10 years the record of your transaction will be kept forever. There are companies out there which are starting to work on blockchain analysis but if you dont have anything to hide then you shouldn't be worried about that.
@_date: 2015-12-16 19:10:40
A mixer will make it hard to trace where your coins are going to where they are coming from. However with share send blockchain.info knows the destination of the coins. While blockchain analysis might prove futile when it comes to trying to figure out where the coins went, the company itself will be able
To associate your ip to the destination address. If you use a vpn however you will be much better protected.

@_date: 2015-12-14 08:00:53
I haven't personally used circle but you might need to confirm the withdraw via your email? If not and if it's showing pending on the blockchain then the coins have already been sent.
If you don't get emails for withdraws then the withdraw is pending until circle actually sends the coins. 
If you mean pending on your electrum wallet then congrats you did it right and when a confirmation hits you will see the full balance
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:53:47
It will take awhile to sync. You can use a lightweight wallet like electrum and get synced up in 5 minutes. Since you already sent the btc from circle to core if you want your btc now you need to extract the private key of the address you sent the coins to using Bitcoin core and then sweeping the private key with electrum.
I know it sounds like a pain but alternatively you can wait a day or 2 for it to sync up.

That custodian can say herp derp you sent coins to a casino and you live in the United States, so now we are going to take them away from you. That's not a wallet it's a Bank 2.0 
Also there is no benefit to coin base having your keys vs blockchain having your keys. Blockchain is a great alternative to coinbase atleast they don't terminate accounts or ask you invasive KYC/AML questions. If you want to blame that on the government then don't advertise yourself as a wallet when you are a bank.
Oh and the sweetest part is you can export all your private keys so even when blockchain goes down your keys are safe
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:47:20

Bitpay is simply terrible. A year ago they were fine but nowadays a simple coffe shop wasn't even able to take my $5 of btc because they couldn't figure out how to use buttpay's shitty app.
Unfortunately it looks like you aren't getting any btc back because of neweggs' policy of not being able to refund btc orders with btc they can only refund you via store credit.
The lesson here is that companies that aren't ready to accept Bitcoin and aren't ready to educate customer service about how it works shouldn't even begin accepting bitcoins as they make both themselves and Bitcoin look bad.

When each block miner is 900+ KB. Since max size is 1mb that's the highest each block can currently go
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:20:21
2mb block is better than 1mb block. can't we all agree on that? If we can then lets put that change in place there is literally 0 negative effects that can come off it. Worst case scenario we fill up 2mb with spam transactions for a few days then once the spammer runs out of btc we give ourselves an extra year to decide what should be done further. 
Putting the community in this stalemate is ridiculous and doesn't do anybody any good. Sooner or later Bitcoin will become Myspace and some other currency, possibly CryptoNote based will become Facebook. 
People want change, the community wants SPECIFIC issues addresses. Like confidential transactions, rbf, etc. etc. Why is nothing getting addresses but instead fingers are getting pointed. Grow up.

Agreed. Bitcoin was never meant to be mined by asics. That creates centralization.

You could fork bitcoin, but it would be best to clone an old alt coin that doesn't have too many libraries and nuances to deal with. If you have a hard time cloning coins you can google a tutorial we wrote on our site called "why altcoins are dying and how to make one in under an hour"
To make the protocol similar make sure blocktime is 10 minutes, block size is 1mb, and total supply is 21M coins.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:23:49
30 cents is more than enough for any transaction to get confirmed in the next block. 30 cents is still better than the $50 WU charges you for intl transfers. 30 cents is still better than paypal's 5% fee on any transaction for goods/services.

Unless you saved the backup seed somewhere the only way to retrieve the private keys are either by unlocking the wallet with your password or creating a new wallet from the saved seed. 
You most likely didn't save the seed so unless you can remember the password your last option is to try and brute force your password.

There are plenty of coins which do not have asics mining them and nobody has taken over their network. Not only is it not feasible but it's also not profitable. Could also use a hybrid system of pow and pos. But one thing is certain bitcoin was meant to be mined by the average joe, not some fat cats who just care about profit and raising fees, fees are already higher than PayPal or visa how is that okay?
I really do not understand why anybody supports ASIC miners.

True, miners supposedly protect the network but honestly we could do that ourselves with some GPUs. We do not need the miners and they know it. That is why they resort to threats in order to try and keep us in line. 
Miners are the disease. Bitcoin needs to implement scrypt-N and get rid of those miners once and for all. Guess what, bitcoin price will also probably go up cuz we will stop seeing all the sell pressure by those miners dumping their stashes.

I could get that done. All you need is a simple vps with bitcoind running on it. Make a site that allows user sign up and a simple wallet that allows deposits / withdrawals. Next add some HTML and css for the exchange forms. You might also need an escrow system, still easy to do. 
Its doable and personally would take me around 2 weeks. I would charge around $5000 to get it done anything less and its not worth my time.

It's easy to put the blame on a law when in fact the law doesn't specifically ask for an ID it asks for KYC / AML info. If Bitcoin ATMs can satisfy that requirement with a phone number while exchanges are requiring an ID then BTMs are superior to Bitcoin Exchanges and customers should use that instead.
I believe that coinbase is overly invasive when it comes to verifying customers. I'm sure that's he picture the want to paint for regulators but they don't seem to care about the customer. There are different exchanges which do not require such invasive info to be shared. 
Bitcoin exchanges shouldn't be more regulated than banks, period.

The issue here is that newegg can't offer refund in Bitcoin because it would create an issue with fraud. It is clear in their ToS that refunds only come as a form of store credit. I understand your frusturation with their policy but I believe the refund should be pretty fast and especially if they just give you store credit you can spend it and get your product.
@_date: 2015-11-06 09:32:44
Newegg won't give you a refund in btc either. Must have had issues with fraud so they don't wanna take any losses
@_date: 2015-11-26 05:48:56
just google how to recover your bitcoin from blockchain using electrum. There is a tutorial on how to sweep private keys using electrum that way would be much safer and easier. Just make sure you don't forget your electrum password, but as long as you store the wallet seed you should be fine.

The fact that a phone number is required in order to even open a bank account is discriminating against users who are too poor to afford a line.
2FA should be an option not a requirement.

She should have heard out the defendant. I heard of this scam happening and if anything it should be the buyer's fault as he didn't follow escrow. Or she should have at least given him 50% refund as its not like the defendant got any profit out of it.
@_date: 2015-11-29 21:01:06
If you read the article it states that they actually DO require a phone number. The issue was when the customer provided them with a phony number which couldn't be used for 2FA. The fact that it took weeks to resolve the issue is also an indication of how slow banks operate.

If bread wallet let's you import that key then do that and then send the coins to another address in your breadwallet. Should achieve the same thing.

No specific even causes Bitcoin price spikes or falls. You are using parallel construction logic in this post, Black Friday along with some Fox News hype and banks being greedy is what caused the price to go up. However, a whale can exit any time and the price will drop right back to $320

Better yet don't leave your coins on an exchange because they aren't really your coins. Use breadwallet or electrum or armory to actually have access to the private keys and have full control.
Buy bitcoins with cash through lbc and you won't have any limits on withdrawals or the amount you can buy. Exchanges = Banks.

Blockchain.info has an app you can use to pair your phone with the online wallet that you would access on your desktop. 
If you don't trust blockchain with your private keys you can export the keys and save them in case blockchain goes down.
It's not exactly open source but is fairly secure.
@_date: 2015-11-20 12:37:55
Btc-e doesn't require any verification but they are also anonymous so they may disappear with your coins. They have been in the game for quite a few years now so chances of them randomly disappearing is low.

BitJohn is now threatening us and claiming this is a libelious article when we are just reporting other user's experience with the service. Look at our post's comment section. 
"This story is well not true... And should be removed as it is libelous. The mallaebility issue didnt cause a wallet issue for us it caused a DB issue for us that required manual cleaning of the bad txid's. There is no BTC withdraw issue."
"Its a "blog" again written with no sources that seems intentionally bent on targeting our company. Are there some held withdraws here and there sure is they are all Anti Money Laundering Related for the most part. Meaning the customers in question need to provide more information about why they are doing something no different than Coinbase or any other reputable exchange. There are laws if you break them they come to bite you. Like posting something as news without factual sources its libel and if it causes damage or perceived damage opens a news site up for damages. Again I highly recommend the Merkle has this blog post removed before we are forced to seek damages as everything I am saying is provable."

I believe that btc-e's price is so much lower then other exchanges because they have more sell pressure to get fist out of btc-e. Since they do not do KYC or submit to any AML regulations many criminals use it to launder their coins, when doing so they deposit coins to the exchange sell them to usd and get the wire from btc-e right to their bank.

As unfortunate as your situation is try and figure it out with circle. It looks like they closed the account due to fraud not due to flagging for KYC /AML purposes because in that case from what I've heard they let you take out the funds.

Exactly! We are not saying that it is a scam for companies to ask for AML / KYC info. Coinbase does that, but they do not trick users into depositing coins and only after the fact freeze accounts and lockup user's funds. 
Coinbase does it the ethical way. Ask users for personal info and THEN allow service. OR for existing users, let them withdraw their coins and THEN suspend service.

Should've never used coinbase in the first place. Funny thing is even banks don't ask you what you use the cash you withdraw at an ATM for, but coinbase goes above and beyond to track your funds. They obviously don't care about customer satisfaction they care about their pretty little investors. Well guess what, with no customers your investors aren't gonna be very happy.
