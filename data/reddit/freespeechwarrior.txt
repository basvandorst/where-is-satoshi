This argument is as equally invalid as yours, but it was made often in the past, and based on the same fallacious reasoning:


@_date: 2018-01-13 22:11:12
The difference between us is you assume the legitimacy of the State.
If I wanted to put you in a cage for the rest of your life, would you fight back?
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:44:53
That’s discussed in the link.
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:21:44


Again, you assume that it is legitimate for the state to impose those consequences upon him for simply promoting voluntary trade between willing parties.  That’s the disconnect we are having.

The means of extortion was threatening to bring in the State as I understand it.
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:29:30
Visiting a place or a friends house does not empower them to coerce or harm others in any way.  Visiting a country and paying taxes to it does, but all countries are guilty of coercion against peaceful people.
I have plenty of friends with different ideologies, including Statists like yourself.  But to speak with someone or befriend them is not to materially support their immoral behavior. 
Guns are just a tool, and are not inherently evil or immoral, if I thought they were I could avoid materially supporting any producer or use of them.... besides government.
I am free to avoid patronizing a company who pollutes and withdraw my contribution to such.
I have no such option when it comes to government, which also happens to be the biggest polluter on the planet.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:33:19
Contracts don’t work this way.
Contracts require specificity,  consideration, capacity and proper form.
I had no capacity to enter into contracts at the time of my birth, there is no specificity as government regularly changes the rules, nor is their any clear form to your imaginary social contract.
Furthermore while you clearly attempt to show consideration for your imaginary agreement, no such consideration exists.
Even if I completely avoid and refuse all the services above, even if I loudly make clear that I disagree with taxation and everything the state does.... they will tax me.
Even if I were to leave the us entirely, they will tax me.
No, the “social contract” is not a contract, it is a tortured excuse for extortion.
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:55:59
You’re welcome to your opinion.
My opinion is that Ulbricht was justified in enlisting violent actors to defend against someone attempting threatening to do the same against his business.
It is not what I would do myself as a pacifist, but I don’t think he should be condemned for it, and he wasn’t.
He was never charged with anything in relation to seeking a hit man, and as far as I know the evidence of this was not even presented/allowed at trial.
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:45:21
This is not true.
US expatriates are still taxed by the IRS.
How are they making use of any of the above in a foreign country?
Similarly, even if I stay at home and avoid all of the above, I am still expected to pay taxes.
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:40:49
Keeping one’s income or funds secret is no more offensive to me than voluntary trade, again it’s an assumption on your part that the government has the right to know everything we do as a means to control us.
“Conspiracy to traffic” is voluntary trade.
I’d be interested to hear about the computer hacking you refer to if you have a source,  I ask for sources to ensure we are dealing with the same base information and to allow you to make as strong an argument for your position as you can and to avoid claims that I use a biased source of info.


Yes I do.  What is involuntary about paying for either of those and receiving it?


Your happiness is not sufficient justification to coerce others.

This is not true, they will be taxed on exit.
My opposition to taxation is partly due to the fact that it funds the murder of foreigners.

@_date: 2018-01-14 06:45:41
Read it in full context:
And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, **to catch him in his words.** And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? Shall we give, or shall we not give? **But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me?** bring me a penny, that I may see it. And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.
This link addresses it further: 
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:26:03
IMO we already have one.


Whose image and superscription is upon the bitcoin?
Long, but relevant:
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:37:44
Ok, but as I pointed out, consideration is only one required aspect of what makes up a contract.
The fact that the State requires you to hold up your end of this imaginary "social contract" even when they aren't doing anything in return shows that even your argument for that aspect of a contract is flawed.
The social contract is complete bullshit.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  It does not exist as an actual contract even in the theoretical sense.
I agree, that it is especially egregious what our government does to expatriates, but the entire justification for all of it is unjustifiable at the core.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:14:31
Yes, that was my point.
Governments are totally willing to use violence to exert control, and they are not above confiscation.
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:36:51
Yes, I feel ashamed when I am forced to pay for the murder of foreigners in my name.
My sense of ethics makes me sick at the thought of funding Trump’s xenophobic border wall and mass deportations.
Where is your shame in extorting others to shape the world in your own image?
What source of ethics compels you to force others to pay for their own panopticon?

@_date: 2018-01-13 21:44:38

My point stands.

I can’t copy paste from that document, but it accuses Ulbricht of “computer hacking conspiracy” not hacking itself.  This is an important distinction.
It accuses Ulbricht of this by alleging that the Silk Road allowed the sale of “malicious software”
It is not making the claim that products were deceptively sold that were unknown to be malicious (i.e. if I sold you a program that was a Trojan horse to you unknowingly this would be fraud and worthy of corrective action) it’s making the claim that malicious software was made available to purchase in a way that the purchasers knew what they were getting.
Again this goes back to voluntary trade.


In my libertarian paradise you describe I can assure you social security numbers and government ids will have little importance to my life.  The insecure identity infrastructure maintained by incompetent governments is a problem of government intervention itself, not individual liberty.


I oppose government power in part because it often leads to the murder of foreigners.  Becoming a foreigner is not a solution to this problem.
Additionally even if I leave the US I am expected to pay for their violence and corruption worldwide, or robbed further for the privilege of exiting.
Do you think Adolf Hitler’s Government was acceptable because you were not a citizen of it?

You still keep focusing on consideration (which isn't there as I have shown above) and have not at all addressed any of the other requirements that make a contract bonafide.

@_date: 2017-05-11 11:14:14
It already is, any attempts the State makes to fight it will only serve to prove its necessity and value.
Bitcoin is the foil to the State.
Society has advanced to a point where we largely eschew violence, but governments use the abstraction of currency to obfuscate the violence necessary to control their populations.
Bitcoin returns us to a time where those obfuscations are made clear again to be worthless promises and empowers us with assets that can only be appropriated from us with force, like gold.

There is nothing that can be done except to better secure computers.
To the extent that traffic can be anonymized, the internet is fundamentally anarchistic.  Defense is left up to the actions of individuals.

I don't disagree, but one of the major problems in Venezuela right now is runaway inflation of a fiat currency.  This is, if anything precisely what Bitcoin was built to combat.

"weaken and eventually help kill"
I'm not suggesting Bitcoin is a magic bullet, but it does neutralize the excesses allowed by fractional reserve banking and fiat currency once it reaches a large enough scale.
It also has the potential to make Taxation much more "in your face" so that the masses may more clearly see the theft it represents.

Yes, and that power is incredibly dangerous and has already been abused many times in the past.


Primarily an elimination of taxation,  If you believe government to be justified and necessary, reduction/elimination of taxation will have the effect of reducing the potential corruption and improving government's responsiveness to the desires of the people.
Taxation is a broad unchecked power that has the effect of neutralizing any and all other protections in law and of our constitution.
Marijuana prohibition started as a Tax.
Gun control started and a Tax.
The Obamacare individual mandate is a Tax.
If taxes are necessary to fund government, that's one thing, but to use the power to tax so broadly as a means of control is incredibly insidious and should be abolished.
But ideologically I am a voluntarist/ancap   though I'm open to Anarcho-Socialism as well.  


Taxes are abhorrent and fund abhorrent things, I only bring up the child abuse example because you suggested that someone was somehow capable of consenting by nature of birth.  So I'm trying to find where you draw the limit on that?
Did jews consent to gas chambers by nature of being born within german borders?


This is an assumption and based on a logical fallacy, the idea that because roads are currently provided by taxation that it is the only way they could ever be provided.


Defensive violence, and even retributive violence is quite a different matter.
I am speaking purely of the aggressive nature of the State when it becomes violent to non-violent actors.
Example: Eric Garner
This is a man who was choked to death on the street for selling cigarettes without paying taxes on them.

Theft: to unilaterally deprive someone of the owernship of a thing without the consent of the owner.
Taxation: The coercive taking of money from citizens to pay for government.

The entire concept is incredibly dangerous and almost always leads to disaster.
Power corrupts, giving power to people over others is always a recipe for corruption.
No matter how many times you write down something abhorrent or how many people agree to sign it, does not make the nature of it any more acceptable.


Represent me in doing what is the key?  They are representing me in making rules to dictate the actions or non actions of others.  That is precisely what I oppose.


I want no part in the process of dictating the behavior of others whether it is democratic or dictatorial.  The net effect is the same.

Does an abused child also consent by nature of their birth to abusive parents?


I would if there was any chance of ending the theft through doing so, and even though there isn't I still do so to the extent possible.
The violent monopolization of essential services does not justify theft for them, and it is not hypocritical to attempt to re-secure a portion of assets stolen from you via whatever means are available.
I do refuse to vote on principle, so seeing as I have no representation, I should not be required to pay taxes correct?
At one time, taxes were only assessed on voters, and in that case you could make the case that they were much more voluntary and closer to how you seem to envision them.

Nothing about the correct statement "Taxation is Theft" suggests that people should break the law.
People should pay their taxes for the same reason you should generally go along with a mugger.  Don't end up like Eric Garner.


You agree that taxation is theft, so how can avoid taxation itself be a theft?  I agree that it is advisable to pay the thugs, but certainly not due to any moral obligation.

Intentionally broad with respect to the rights of the people and intentionally specific and limiting to the powers of government.
The constitution functions as a white list of power, not a black list of restrictions.
The bill of rights confuses this for most people exactly as Hamilton anticipated.
So we ended up with the 10th amendmentent to satisfy those who felt a Bill of Rights was necessary while still clarifying that the intent of the Constitution was to enumerate a specific and small list of powers to the federal government while leaving all other rights to the People or States.
Not an attempt to specially restrain, but to specifically empower.
This is why in the 1900's we felt it necessary to pass an amendment to outlaw certain substances found disagreeable, but in modern times the commerce clause has been abused and widened further than Goatse's asshole.
