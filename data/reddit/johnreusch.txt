You're not using trybtc.com as a wallet. In fact you can't use it as a wallet. Any (free) bitcoins you earn via following the tutorials are deposited into a Coinbase account as part of an extension of the learning process. I'm uncertain of how this service is a "scam", as they are not asking you for money (fiat or BTC), and you're not giving them money, and at best they may or may not be donating a few μBTC to charity. Sending spam to your friends about trybtc is also optional (just skip that section of the tutorial, I did).
Edit: Forgot, no videos.

Combine tips that have been donated from multiple users within the same time-frame into one reply message with a breakdown. Its not much of an issue now, but might become a larger one in the future if both Bitcoin and ChangeTip become really big. 
As a hypothetical, take User1. Their YouTube video is a smash hit, with User1 getting tens to hundreds of tips a minute. Right now your system would reply to each of those individual messages letting User1 know they got a tip. That has to use a decent amount of the bot's time, and time to read and process by the person receiving the tips. An example of the condensed version:
**[User1]( you have been tipped a total of **5,848 bits** from **5 tippers** at 1:23 PM:  
- The Bitcoin tip for **248 bits** by **[Tipper5]( has been collected  
- The Bitcoin tip for **500 bits** by **[Tipper3]( has been collected  
- The Bitcoin tip for **1,000 bits** by **[Tipper1]( has been collected   
- The Bitcoin tip for **2,000 bits** by **[Tipper2]( has been collected  
- The Bitcoin tip for **2,100 bits** by **[Tipper4]( has been collected

Posting to see how changetip works. Yay, bits of bitcoin!

Simple test: If I tipped this person X amount of money in foreign currency or giftcards, would I look like an asshole for wasting their time? Or, more to the point, is the value of what I'm tipping greater than the value of the time needed to redeem the tip? In this case, unless the person being tipped uses or invests in bitcoin, no, not for ~ 50 cents.

I'm assuming its use in crime is relevant to the exhibit, since this is only part of what it says for the 500 Euro note right above it. Reading the full text portrays it in an even worse light than the Bitcoin.

100 bits This post is an example of why ChangeTip is currently needed. I wouldn't have been able to easily tip this post without ChangeTip. First, you didn't append a Bitcoin address where I could send a tip if I wanted to. Second, after one click, I cannot immediately find a Bitcoin address to send a tip to in your Reddit profile. Psychologically, every extra step or click, and every extra second of time a person has to spend, is going to lessen the chance they send a tip. 
Ease and speed of use is what ChangeTip currently has over other methods. Had I not typed out this whole post sending you a tip would have taken less than 10 seconds, and would only take that long because this is the first tip I've ever sent and was completely new to how to send a tip. In order for there to be no middle-man to tipping, social network platforms would have to add fields for Bitcoin addresses in user profiles, or users themselves would have to append Bitcoin addresses to whatever they post.
ChangeTip may be replaced in the future, but if history has shown anything, its that most people will take the quick and easy route. Right now, for tipping in Bitcoin, that is ChangeTip.
