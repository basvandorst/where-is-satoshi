If Frank happen's to sit right next to me, and I just give him the gold and he gives me fiats, where's the problem?
You guys are missing the point completely. Most businesses have a balance to keep up, most employees and service providers are no where near accepting bitcoin as payment (6-18 months?), so the company that decides to accept bitcoin has no choice but to instantly translate it to it's fiat value, otherwise they risk of losing some money due to volatility, and also to avoid the hassle of actually handling Bitcoin from the regulatory point of view (try telling your accountant that you have Bitcoins in the company and see how he starts sweating), the security is a bitch as well, and the insurance is so expensive you could ignore it all together and just claim there is no proper insurance for bitcoin.
So instead of bitching about business who do accept bitcoin but chose to translate most or all of it to fiat as not REALLY BEING A BITCOIN BUSINESS, try being a bitcoin business yourself and see how much shit you have to go through to just receive a $10 payment as a legit company.
You and [Adog353]( need to pull that long stick you have stuck up your asses, and start thanking those businesses for stepping up and doing something radical like accepting Bitcoin in 2014.

I absolutely support fully open-books companies like Mastercoin, I think this is the way to go to the new economy - if you have something to hide about your expenses or income (as a company, public or private) you are doing something wrong.
As individuals it might actually become a concern especially at this early stage when people can use that information to attack those who share it for various purposes.
As for privacy concerns when it comes to IP and business-logic - I could see some potential issues (i.e. google is partnering with Apple to do XYZ), but do we really want to live in a world where that kind of information is kept secret? We live in a world like that now, and we see it's not helping anyone besides the people who profit from that information being secret.

2014 - A person needs to read these instruction on the most popular website on the internet*, to use a 19th century technology so that someone on the other line could *type it in a computer* using some 20th century CRM behamoth platform, which is then probably sent over to be printed on sheets of sliced trees, to be collected into a "file" and placed inside a cardboard box in an a huge hangar to be left in the dark for who knows how long, register the 'complaint' in some sort of database to be queried by yet another person to produce a report that will then be printed on sliced trees as well, filed again, and maybe this time sent to someone over the email, but most likely printed in 60 copies and handed out to 60 other people who then form conclusions based on those printed sheets of paper and send an email to whoever needs to see that information.

Not sarcastic at all. AUD CAD and USD are all *dollars*, they are *the have the same currency name*, hence the same currency symbol. And because of that idiotic choice of naming the currencies, we now have to describe what currency we mean when we write the $ symbol, but we all know what currency is being talked about when you present the £ symbol.
With Bitcoin the case is that it's completely different name, completely different technology, and it's not the same in any shape or form, why in the world would you want to purposefully collide the symbols of something that represents the new with something that is being used by a considerable amount of people?
Why do you insist that the Thai people will have to write "฿ BTC" instead of just Ƀ?
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:13:41


Sweet! Got anything to share/show?


I feel the same


There's always the tried and true Wordpress.com/.org model - the platform is free, if you want it hosted pay us. Have you considered that?


Yes, I know what you're talking about, but my approach to development is slightly different after experiencing a number of projects of the kind you are describing here. Everything will be defined up to a level where there are no question to answer, and only whether someone wants to do it for the given price or not.
I'm going to separate the client and server code to two separate developers (individuals or service-providers), one will be doing the API, while the other will code the 'client' or front-end.
Additionally I will try to re-use anything and everything, right now just started but I'm hopefully going to find anything I can to write the least code I can. One option that could work for this kind of project, although I prefer a Python or a NodeJS implementation, is using Wordpress. It comes with a built-in user system, has plenty of plugins on the content creation and curation side,has the ability to go multilingual with a simple plugin configuration, and has many many templates available to fit just that need (Map/Directory).
If I find that you are indeed right and that no one will want to do either side for the given budget, I will get more funds or return the collected funds thus far and move on to something else. But 10-15 Bitcoins should cover a 2-3 weeks worth of work for 1-2 developers and additionally a week or two of bug fixes.
And once it's stable enough, it can be released as open-source platform, which can then be taken care of by the community, if the community wants it. That's why it's key that this project will go open source so that we don't get stuck with a half-assed product that no one wants to maintain or develop further.


Sounds very interesting and we're open to such partnerships - keep in mind the requirements I'm setting, and we can talk further. My skype is eli.sklar - feel free to contact me.


Sounds exactly like the thing I want to build with the same exact motivation.


Sweet! I'll add you to my friends list :)

I'm not related to that agency in any shape or form, but I do appreciate their contribution to the bitcoin ecosystem.
The fact that is that even this ฿ symbol does not represents the actual symbol of bitcoin, the double-horned B (which you proudly display in the black swan pic). There is no Unicode character for the double-horned B, which makes you use the Thai Baht symbol instead.
And yet you boast the fact that the double-horned/thai baht symbol is more popular - well duh, it always was. But eventually industry leaders are adopting the more appropriate symbol and it seems that the trends is getting stronger by the day.
But you know something you're missing? It's one of the reasons why I love bitcoin so much - *it doesn't have an* ***official*** *symbol*. You are free to discuss, create, and propose *any* symbol for bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't have *a* marketing team, it has all of us as their marketing team.
And I'm not insulting him, just pointing out the fact. Those *people* that he mentions that have some problems that needs to be fixing are one of the finest developers in the industry that bring actual value to the entire community, while that idiot, which he is as a fact, not opinion or an insult, decides that the symbol that he happens to like *is the right one*.

MaidSafe is actually developing something completely different - they're focusing on how to store and distribute information on top of the internet layer, they're not suggesting a new way to create a new network infrastructure but a way to utilize existing (or otherwise) infrastructure to distribute information on top, essentially a replacement to old-school servers and datacenters.

Praise Blockchain.info for adopting the *proper* symbol for Bitcoin.
I'm kind of the reason that the Ƀ symbol was resurrected back in 2012, it was almost dead by middle of 2012, and me and a few other early-adopters (MNW and Mihai Alisie) basically brought the symbol from the dead and it began taking over the The Bitcoin Magazine.
Since then it became more and more prevalent in the Bitcoin world, and nowadays I see more Ƀ than the Thai Baht symbol.
You, the community, have no fucking clue about usability or style or care about the fact that the Thai Baht symbol is taken, actively used by the Thai people, why the fuck would you want to conflict with their currency symbol?
Additionally the Ƀ symbol is much cleaner, easier to read and instantly recognizable, it's **not** used by anything else, and it's catching on, as it should.
Although I'm perhaps one of the biggest proponents of the Ƀ symbol, I still like the fact that Bitcoin has several symbols, and no 'official' symbol.
OP is an idiot, since he thinks that his wants and needs are the communities wants and needs, and neglecting to consider the owners of the software that he's bashing as being part of the community that he claims doesn't wants that symbol.

A lot went bust because a lot was just bullshit. Bitcoin is somewhere between the entire NASDAQ and the best companies with the best developers.
It can go bust, but something very extraordinary will need to happen. If anything, ideas that provide little value, like pets.com might sound like a good investment to intoxicated ears are not Bitcoin, they're more like Dogecoin (no offense to anyone) and other alts that are just plain useless compared to the real deal, and people will always try to catch the train they missed.
All in all Bitcoin behaves beautifully both as an investment and as a tool or a technology. It's a marvel of engineering and it has the best minds on the planet working to improve and empower it. What else would you want from a good investment?

I think that the IP foundation is sound and most probably will not need replacement.
Perhaps I wasn't very clear, but the infrastructure I'm referring to are the actual landlines and telecom companies that are used to ferry our internets to our homes and mobile devices.
The internet providers of today are essentially nodes that connect one network to another, gateways. What I'm proposing is that these will be only that, connecting the American network with the European one for example, since they already have a lot of infrastructure running under the oceans and up in space. 
The internet in our cities should be centralized, it's inefficient and waste a lot of resources, considering the alternative I'm proposing. They are prone to physical failures, many times leaving people without internet for prolonged periods of time because a single cable snapped somewhere.
Think of what I'm proposing not as a replacement to well established technologies that need no replacement, but instead as bringing the internet up to date with technology that evolved only recently.

The hardware layer is the walls inside which we can navigate - if a government decides to disallow access to websites like GitHub then you're no longer able to freely express yourself and access information that might be crucial for your livelihood.
With an alternative that can initially sit on top of the existing infrastructure and eventually become the infrastructure that cannot be controlled by governments like ISPs are.
You and me are enjoying somewhat a free internet, we usually can say and access anything we want, so perhaps it's harder for us to understand why we would want to change something, but don't forget that even in the US we've seen situations where internet was cut off to entire neighborhoods.

I personally think that anyone who is interested in being involved in bitcoin should have a voting right in such a scheme, in this scenario it doesn't really matter how much you hold in BTC, it just matters that it's possible to verify your identity.
Awhile ago I've heard an interesting approach to liquid democracy that introduces payments - you get paid to vote and the more people vote through you (I.e. they delegate their vote to you) the more money you earn.
As for those who do not vote, or don't give a fuck as you put it, these votes are just like today's votes that don't participate in elections - so there isn't much we can do nor do I think we should do something about it, I prefer people to vote if they care and have an opinion (even if it's not scholarly), otherwise they're just creating noise.
Liquid democracy as it is today isn't perfect, and the main problem I believe is the lack of development and testing, and yet I'd prefer my country to be run by liquid democracy even though most of the things wouldn't change because 90% of the voters following blindly some community/religious leader, liquid democracy could allow people like me who care to have change, unlike with today's representative democracy.

@_date: 2015-08-24 13:19:41
It's ain't perfect, but it's better than the representative/committee democracy we have today. 
I don't have a problem with dogmatic votes because dogma is a matter of subjectivity, and your beliefs might appear to be dogmatic to me and vise versa, so who are we to decide which is which?
Absolutely agreed about per individual voting system, I don't think we can achieve anything better (i.e. fair and true) than that at the moment.
@_date: 2015-08-23 21:02:45
I also think that transparency is required to create a real democracy rather than a [plutocracy disguised as a capitalistic/socialistic democracy](
So yea, it has some privacy issues that we might object, but I don't think there is real privacy in our age. Hopefully with tools like liquid democracy and bitcoin we will be able to say we have true privacy when needed.

Everything said and done, I have a theory that Mike &amp; Gavin are doing just that - providing a solution.
It might the case that they've created XT with the full knowledge that it will create a huge debate as people would fear full-blown fork on the main network, and purposefully planted ideas that they knew would be opposed - i.e. the white-listing.
Once the debate reaches critical mass and the critics would say "Yea, we get that we need to increase the block-size limit, but everything else in XT should go" - M&amp;G would drop the rest of the arguments and increase block-size limit on the main network as we now have a consensus on that. The end result would be that XT would be gone, but the blocksize increase would happen as it probably needs to happen.

Why is this an issue? It's a fact of life - most simply don't care enough to vote one way or another, or even enough to vote at all.

Yes, liquid democracy is different, it allows us to reach consensus in the most efficient way all the while allowing you to sit back and just watch it happen or take action and rally people around you to change opinions, unlike today's circus that we call elections where you chose a monkey and pay a few bucks to some asshole so he can animate it for your amusement making you think you've actually contributed.

Right, I actually referred to the double-bar symbol. But I guess you're right on that one, because as in the dollar this can be used as well.
In any case, I personally prefer the Ƀ symbol. I don't know, it just looks more professional, clean, and simplistic, all are subjective and could be used on the competing symbol as well...

Ok, since it's not leaked, and you're the one that represents the company or tied to it in some other way, I'll allow myself to critisize the wallet and it's advertisement.
- Whenever I see "The last X you'll ever need" I know that it's surely won't be.
- You have a Gnome/android desktop on a 1" screen? seriously? It would have been better if you'd render the design with some kind of numbers, or even a clock on it, but a gnome/android desktop? that's just absurd.
- Leaked? You're the one that leaked it
- What are the specs? Pretty pictures are great and all, but what will you allow to do on the platform? is it open source (Open Source does not mean free license, just open source, I won't use it if it's not open source...)? can we scrutinize it?
- You've got a bunch of pretty logo's on the bottom of the leaked advert, do you have actual agreements with these companies? or are you hoping that you will get it once you're out and available?
- If it's not vaporware, where are the prototype pics?
I'm not trying to get you down, I'm simply showing what kind of questions my mind generates when I see something like this. If these questions get satisfactory answers this may very well be a great product, otherwise it's just another "one of those ideas", which is great, but not worth much in the long run.

No one in the Bitcoin community or outside of it wants to actually put real money on the line to get Bitcoin to the next step.
I've been working on Safebit since July '11, and started raising funds for the company in September. I've met with countless investors of all shapes and sizes, and spoken to a few key figures from the Bitcoin community, but couldn't get the project to a level where people can put money on it, although it's "very interesting" to all of the investors I've met.
Getting money into Bitcoin projects from outside of the community is extremely hard, Bitcoin has a reputation of a ponzy scam at worst, and just some silly little project at best.
My goal with Safebit was and still is - to provide an easy to use, cross-platform, secure bitcoin wallet designed to appeal to existing Bitcoin users and also attract new comers.
As I see it - those who already have some money into Bitcoin are only seeing their part of the game, be it an exchange, a mining pool, a mining facility, or some consumer facing shop, not many realises that in order to get Bitcoin adoption faster and bigger we need better tools, and with all due respect to the tools out there, they are still designed for the early adopters and have very little appeal to the masses.
After six-seven months of trying to raise funds for this project I'm very close to just moving on to the next big thing, and leave Safebit either fully open-source or in cold storage waiting for better days.
Yes, Bitcoin is a great idea and it could easily replace a lot of our daily monetary interactions in a year or two, but without simple consumer facing applications, and simple merchants tools, it's not going to happen anytime soon. And this saddens me to no end.

I was thinking on a small strip of nylon inside the note (think of the note as an envelope), which you would have to rip out (and essentially destroy the not) out of the note to get. Maybe even making it a diagonal one (would make it more expensive to produce).
The problem is not the private key, the problem is certifying that the key was not compromised.
Maybe we could print parts of the private key in various factories, that for example someone like Coinabul and Cassacius could each print part of a key that they each don't have access to, and a third party (a trusted attorney, accountant) could be the one providing a seal of approval (which would not know the full private key as well).

MtGox provides me with a free YubiKey, they're rather safe for the time that I've been using them (since Nov 2011), and they have pretty good customer care.
Yes, they've had problems in the past, but they're obviously learning from that, and I rather be work with someone who is responsible and persistent to provide the service they promise.
They might be shit, but they're the best shit I know, and judging by the volume traded on MtGox I'd say it's the shit that everybody knows. And likes, apparently.

Not exactly. Although rather different the spread of [Telegraphs]( in the late 19th century is kind of analogues (I *really* don't have a lot of idea what I'm talking about, just paraphrasing some stuff that I've read/heard in the past here) to the spread of Bitcoin.
It's a brand new technology that benefits anyone who touches it, and provides new ways of doing business on a global scale.
Improving the technology itself or building on top of it is almost risk free, and the potential return is insanely high. While they are different, saying that there are no comparisons to bitcoin is incorrect **imho**.

I've never been very interested in coin/note security design, and I'm not exactly the *go to guy* for security matters, my knowledge is rather limited in that area, but that being said I would imagine a key that is split between two printers which would not know who prints the other part of the key (so that they couldn't collude even if they wanted to), and printed on a nylon strip embedded in the note itself in such a way that to get it you would have to destroy the note in a way that would make it clear that it's no longer valid.
On a side note: It would be amazing if somehow these notes could have  tiny chip in them, and an e-ink to display the value of the note. So every time you are with the note near an NFC hot spot, your note would update it's value and display the actual value in the bitcoin address associated with the note.

I see some skeptic responses here and on the routers site about how widespread it is (Bitcoin, that is), and I just like to mention that I've been to the recent Singularity University convention in Israel a couple of weeks back, and almost every speaker mentioned Bitcoin, and in a good way too.

4. Patience is not one of my strong points, I admit. And downvotes are unnecessary as this is a rather welcome product that I'd happily see on store shelves and probably would pay the $30 price, I just wanted to get some answers.
Carry on, and next I suggest chose your wording carefully as people like me (and some of the commenters here) see words like "leaked" and expect a genuine leak, and when it's not actually a leak, and rather a free release of the information by the owner itself, it just smells bad in the first place (and lowers the overall credibility of the product).

No, this is true. If you read the part of my argument that you've commented on, you'll see that the statement itself is true.


Let the private printers print Bitcoin with diverse art, what I'm referring to is something that we can all relate to. Farmers working that land is unlikely concept to be related to these days by most of the population. No one actually works the land anymore the way you depict it in your memory (I'm not claiming I know what you think, I'm just guessing).


Really? Carl Sagan would lead to nationalism? Nikola Tesla? Alan Turin? How about Einstein? How about Socrates or Plato? What about Stephen Hawking? I can name at least a dozen more that have nothing to do with nationalism and I still idolize because they are well deserving to be idolized for their contribution to *the entire human kind* and not a single nation or tribe.
If you disagree with the proposal, could you at least be so kind as to provide an alternative? An example of what *you* would like to see?
@_date: 2012-06-17 16:38:28
See my comment to his comment agreeing that is not actually a problem (neither the double-bar nor the single-bar).
Although there are symbols that are used for multiple currencies, I think Bitcoin should not start it's life being *similar* to something else. That's why I'm against this symbol in general and why it does bothers me that this symbol is already used by someone else.
We're basically saying to the Thai people that look, we're using Bitcoin this way already, get used to it, and when you want to denominate Bitcoin and Thai Baht in the same line, you better find a different way to differentiate them, as these are exactly the same symbols.
Why would we create something that could potentially cause problems to someone? We have a symbol that is available that in my opinion is much more suitable aesthetically to our needs, not conflicting with anything else we are aware of, and readily available inside our existing tools (unlike the double-bar B symbol).
I genuinely don't understand the Bitcoin community on this subject.
@_date: 2012-08-06 12:25:46
The thing is, they're trying their best and not making it because they lack the resources and hence the manpower to operate a bank.
It's not their fault, it's the fault of the customers who don't understand the risk they're taking when working with such businesses. Don't work with Bitcoin if you don't want to lose money (and there are plenty of ways of losing money with Bitcoin these days), and don't work with Bitcoin if you don't understand the risk of being an early adopter, or can't afford to lose the money you are putting into the Bitconi economy.

Yes and no, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, but the fact that this was done by a single person, with very little time devoted to it, is in fact makes it amateurish. I'm not suggesting that the person who created it in the first place is an amateur, just the fact that the project he did was.


It doesn't claim anything besides the fact that people are using whatever they have because they cannot or will not devote time to this.


Strongly disagree here. This design is old, it's plain. And it shows.


I'm not looking to replace, rather to refresh. It's far from perfect or fine, it's inadequate for many many reasons. And bitcoin needs a new image, far from SilkRoad (as much as I support the idea of SilkRoad), far from MyBitcoin, far from a lot of thing that happened to bitcoin in the past couple of years.
Bitcoin needs an image that represents the *Currency of the 21st Century*, that represents it's P2P, Democratic, Cryptography, Uncontrollable nature. Bitcoin is replacing the monetary system that was with us for the past 300 years, and rooted in ideas that were relevant 2,500 years ago. This needs a revamped image. It may be to soon, but I don't think so.


Granted, no offence or anything of this type was taken, I'm open to all types of criticism.

WHY DON'T WE TAKE ALL THE BITCOIN GUYS WHO WANT TO WORK FOR BITCOIN, AND START MAKING A BUSINESS OF IT?
Seriously, I'm a web designer/developer myself, with my own side project - Safebit - that I hope to get in working condition soon, but after putting out ads in various places related to bitcoin gigs, I so far got one offer which might come through in the next month or so, importunately it's just a small gig to design an interface, not something permanent.
Someone mentioned Intersango and Amir, they basically a projects company that specializes in Bitcoin related operations - they don't get a lot of work, but they are getting by with a little help from the exchange (is it profitable?).
If there is enough talent that can take a project from start to finish and we can find clients who are willing to pay in bitcoin or otherwise, than it could become a viable business related to bitcoin.
Being early on the scene with good technical skills often comes buy with some serious monetary compensation. Being part of a larger group that can answer several or all aspects of a project also comes in handy.

What about a simple futuristic "overview" that sometimes tech companies do, where you see a camera following a guy throughout the day and he's doing a lot of technical stuff to show off some new tech, you know, to give people ideas and provide inspiration. You can look at Google's augmented reality glasses video they did a few months ago as an example.
So the premise is: In the future you don't need to spend money on fees to credit card companies and banks, and people have full financial control over their accounts.
Scene: A guy wakes up in the morning, takes out his iphone and goes over his emails, and check his bitcoin account. Nothing special so far, like any other banking app.
**Guy on the way to work** - after leaving the house our guy is stopping in a small shick coffee place to pick up his daily coffee, which costs notably less than todays coffee (i.e. if a cup of startbuck costs $1 this will cost 50c). When he's asked to pay, he reaches out to his pocket but instead of picking up a wallet or a credit card he takes out his iphone, and there already he has a popup that says
    Starducks requesting a payment of 50c
    Current monthly coffee blance: $5
    
    Slide to confirm
The guy slides the the confirmation button/slider and the camera cuts to the cashiers screen to see a message saying "Payment Confirmed. 50c John Whathisname", the camera shows their happy faces and the guy moves on to his daily routine going to work.
Scene: The guys at work watch a ballgame and start arguing about the score of the game their watching and who's gonna win the game, and one of our guys friends offering a bet, "$50 bucks that Shmoes win", "You're on" says our guy, reaches back to his pocket (to look like he's reaching for his wallet) and takes out his iphone again, this time the camera shows him entering a simple contract that says "If the Shmoes win tonight Joun Whatshisname wins $50 from Bromisomo, and if they lose he must pay Bromisimo $50".
Sure enough the film cuts to 20 minutes latter, and John wins the bet, as expected. He reaches for his iphone again, and sends a payup request to Bromisimo for the $50 along with the contract they both agreed to earlier, the camera focus on Bromisimo who reaches for his iphone with a distinct look of unsatisfied man just as soon as it lights up with a request for payment from John. He then is given a payment request similar to the one from Starducks.
I'd back that kind of video with a few ~~bucks~~ bitcoins for sure...

@_date: 2012-05-15 21:08:56


After seeing the video on your site another idea poped:
We're following the same game from the futuristic overview, this time we're looking at how much money he wastes on fees to commercial banks and credit companies.
Premise: You are throwing away your hard earned cash by using an obsolete concept of money.
A screen full of numbers is showing, nothing meaningful. The scene turns into a fast-forward video of the guy's life, a day in 30-40 second, and then a month in 30-40 seconds, and then a year in 30-40 seconds.
Day: He buys coffee and on the left side of the screen it shows how much money he's giving away as fees, and this number grows every time we seem him making a financial transaction. **Coffee** *Cost*: $2, *fees*: 20c. Counting.
Lunch at a nice restaurant: *Cost*: $20, *fees*: $2. Counting.
Going back from work he stops at a fuel pump: *Cost*: $50, *fees*: $5. Counting.
And a few more like these until the day ends [pub, going out with friend to bowl, etc'].
Month: Guy sits at his desk going over bills (paying them with the futuristic iphone bitcoin wallet we've seen in the previous installment), gas, electricity, water, internet, telphone, cabels, xbox live, stuff like that. *Cost*: $X,000, *fees*: $X00. Counting.
Year: As the months go by the left side of the screen fills with hundreds, thousands of dollars lost. Stuff like car insurance, buying a new kitchen, wedding arrangement's, etc.
Final scene: The money saved is show in big number on the screen, and the logos of banks, paypal, and credit card companies, shown below. The next scene shows the guy going to buy himself a new car, and this time it uses the "saved" amount as the car's price, and when the payment goes through the screen shows "fees": **0**, and shows the guy driving happily in his new car. *Bitcoin - The future of Money **Today***

Are you sure that someone needs to know the full public key?
Crypto is not my strong side, but from what I'm seeing there are rather interesting things that can be done with some crypto, such as generating a private key split into several chunks without either one of the sides having access to the full key, only someone with all the chunks could generate the full key.

"What's New?"
The only thing they introduce is the idea that the currency is digital in its entirety, it's still the same system where there is one central authority that can produce this currency, and the source behind this is closed, so we can't even go ahead and see how secure it is for ourselves.
Bitcoin still has more appeal than this privatized version.

Since a bitcoin wallet is basically the final frontier of the user's cash, it's extremely easy to monetize.
Some of the options as I see it: a) Creating services around the wallet to provide better security (think of IronKey integration), b) Providing merchants with tools to integrate into their software and taking a small cut off of each transaction they get, c) taking a small transaction cut (like a tax) from each transaction over a predefined value (say $0.01 for transactions above $10, or any other sensible way), d) partnering with exchanges and getting a percentages off of their revenues.
There are a lot of ways to monetize this, some are better others are worse, but they do exist.
Regarding investing in other bitcoin projects - I haven't seen or heard of any bitcoin project that got any funding from an outside source (not the founders themselves, and not the 3 Effs) in the past year or so, so no, there are no investments in this sectors.

I agree with some of the criticism here, but I welcome the effort.
Although this service is going to be a fringe service right now, it's nice to see people who actually go in these directions.
What we really need for this to go mainstream is a game the size of MW3 to go with this kind of method of payment. You can play for free, but if you want to play and earn money, you will shell out some of your profits.
I wish something like this was operational right now, I would make a ton of money just playing MW3...

I hear this a lot lately.
I have an MtGox account, and although I haven't had to withdraw my funds yet, I haven't had any significant problems with the service so far, and I'm pretty happy about the overall service.
Could you offer a more reliable provider/exchange? Do we have a choice?
The way I see it, stuff like Bitcoinica come and go, but MtGox is here to stay, it's shit, but it's the shit we know and at least they are not screwing us over.
They are pioneers after all, keep that in mind, and whatever they learn in these couple of years would be worth a fortune in a few years. Give them time, and give them the respect that they do deserve, as they do provide the most secure and reliable service so far.

I myself am not familiar with copyright laws that intimately, especially since I'm not a US citizen and do not reside there.
You're probably right that the person owning the original image could not so easily sue the people who are using that image, but nonetheless it is a copyright violation on our part, and we should simply avoid it, as no one here would want their copyrights violated as trivial as they might.

*How* ironic is it exactly? It's easier to denominate the value that I'm actually pledging. It'll be transferred with Bitcoin, but with the fluctuation of the price it's just easier to talk this way.
Get used to doing it this way, most people will talk this way once Bitcoin becomes slightly more popular with the masses. There is no point in saying "it costs you 20Ƀ" because today you may mean $120, tomorrow it may be $60.

The link above is to the digital version - I saw it when I woke up this morning on the printed edition, and it literally made my day (on top of it being 4/20).

The source of the quotes given by Julian next to this comment, and by myself in th other thread.
You've got a good point, but I don't feel like clustering the image more than it is already to provide nicknames and links.
If someone wants to trace the origins, they can.
There are no credits on the entire creation, the entire thing is made by a few different people, the person who took the original image, the person who processed the image, the people who wrote the quoted text, and myself who compiled all that into the above.
I care about credit where credit is due, but not on the creation itself. It's like being annoyed that some singer or performer doesn't say that his creation is based on something someone else did during the song.
Since it's an image, you expect to have the credit high there, I think it can live without the credit on the image, since I'm not crediting myself and I do provide the source where the image is published. 
Am I wrong thinking like that?

It looks like they have a working prototype - even if it's not 100% secure, doesn't have solar charging, and I'll need to establish a host by myself for this thing to work - I would still buy it. I really hope that it's not vaporware...

Lol, I love that people downvote comments like these...
I'm guessing that you mean that it relies on the default bitcoin client (and not the Bitcoin protocol). The word *Safe* inside Safebit is aimed to give sense of security. What technology will be employed to keep your coins safe - I don't know. Right now this release is just a **Preview**, and we have still a lot of work ahead, but the primary goal of Safebit is being a secure and trusted way to use Bitcoins, how it will be done - I'm still investigating.

Mainstream media attention.
So far the amount of mainstream media attention is barely noticeable, those who got in to Bitcoins in the past week or so got into it because they read non-mainstream media sources that started talking about the currency in the past month, Gawker being one of them.
The minute this thing hits mainstream media, a secondary surge of traders will go in, and people will become rich overnight for trading Bitcoins, this will lead to a bigger mainstream media exposure and will create even more Bitcoin traders.
Let's assume that by Monday morning, BTC will be valued at around $25 USD, by the end of the week, some mainstream newspapers will write about it, be it speculations, warnings, or buy alerts, people all over the world will gain recognition for the currency. After a couple of days from the initial panic, the currency will double it's value, and I can assume it will be traded around $50 USD for a single Bitcoin.
100% profit on an investment in only a couple of days, will bring even more mainstream media attention to this, and the third surge of Bitcoin buyers will try to get into the market, at that point you can safely assume that Bitcoin will again double it's value in a matter of days, reaching $100 or more.
@_date: 2011-07-05 00:15:22


Fireworks for now. It the future I think it's going to be either an Adobe Air or Python+Web in a chrome-less Chromium window. In any case it most likely going to be JS/HTML kind of implementation.


The `SAFE` icon will allow you to change wallet.dat files (for example open one from an encrypted thumbdrive), and the `EXIT` sign will close (or hide) the app (perhaps with some kind of locking mechanism - biometric, usual password, etc').


As I've said above, I'm going to use HTML/JS for this project, so it will be very easy to `a)` write custom plugins for this (Python or JS/HTML or maybe even both), and `b)` I will probably make a few options for a dashboard, those who mine coins are interested in a different dashboard from those who trade bitcoins and also normal users who use it as a wallet only.


I don't see why not, if I understand it correctly, Namecoin is just a different version of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-07-05 00:23:47
Wow, thanks! :)
I'm also working on a new kind of pool (actually 2 kinds of pools), and the rest I can't disclose publicly right now. Donations will obviously help if I get enough of them to support my basics for a month or two, other than that funding/investment in my ideas? :)
@_date: 2011-07-05 04:43:12
# UPDATE!
Thank you guys for the kind words, you give me a lot of incentive making this a working reality, and I'm getting tons of useful tips and ideas here!
I would like to show you another screen I'm working on, the [Send/Receive screen]( I have my issues with it, but I'd like to hear your opinion first.
Also, I made a small update to the [dashboard]( based on the requests here and other stuff. Let me know what you think.
Last but not least, I've published my bitcoin address and to my astonishment you guys really like this idea and started supporting the idea right away, hurray! For now it's enough to buy a domain name for the app-to-be, so that's quite impressive for a few hours of existence for the project.
So if you wish to help funding this project, I would gladly work on this project eating nothing but stale crackers for a month rather than doing my day join (coding HTML for toolbars and IE6/7...), so here is the address to show your support: `1Cm554iqhU9dLnZsi2LA5s1b576DdfM1GM`
 Tech Specs
Although I haven't written a single line of code for this, I think this will be built with the following technologies:
+ Python, PyWeb, Chromless Chromium for the back-end - Using Python will give a lot of flexibility and compatibility for a variety of platforms, including Mac, Windows, and Linux. It will probably be easily ported to mobile platforms such as Android, Windows Phone 7, and iOS.
+ HTML5 (Javascript, HTML, CSS) for the front-end (user interface) - Again, using these techs it will be easily portable to other devices and platforms at a minimal cost and maximum flexibility. Also when I start implementing the hosted wallets (see below) it will be possible to run a client without a bitcoin software/wallet installed (great for mobile devices)
I will probably allow plugins and addons from the get-go as I won't be able to implement all of the things you would want in this by myself, and addons in the way to go for me.
 Open Source
Funded or not, this project is going to be fully open source so you will be able to audit, review, and contribute to the project as much as you like.
Will post details as soon as I start coding.
 Future Features
Features I'm thinking about (in no particular order):
+ Group transactions
+ Future transactions - yearly/monthly/weekly/daily payments (or donations ;)
+ *Smart Address Book* - A central server will manage subscriptions to this, and will request a new address from subscribed users every time someone wants to send them something, this will make sure that even normal users who will generally will not create a new address every time, will enjoy (and be sort of enforced to use) this feature. When you send coins, you can either *identify* or send regularly (not through the smart wallet) thus remaining completely anonymous
+ *Compartments within wallets* - As seen on the "Balance", simply allocate funds to "folders" for easy management
+ *Local &amp; Remote Wallets* - Local wallets will be in any way the user decided, including built in encryption and strong security. The remote wallets can be the main drive for the the profitable part of this project (the software will be free and open source) allowing people to store their wallets on the server for a small monthly or transaction based fees. Sort of like Dropbox in that sense that it gives you *some* free storage, and if you use above the free storage you will be asked to start paying. 
 Suggested features that I like:
+ STDOUT and CSV on demand [miner909er](
+ More details at a glance - Last update, is it connected, what block is it running right now [jdkeith]( &amp; [plasticAiredale](
 About me
It looks that this is getting a little traction here on the subreddit, in the next couple of days I'll publish a post on the bitcoin forums to try to get even more attention to this, I know I may be jumping a little a head of myself, but that's just how my brain works.
You can read all about me [here]( and [here](
I'm a web developer from Israel, and recently (6~ months ago) founded my own company.
If this project continues to get a lot of attention, I will be looking for funding one way or another. If you are interested in supporting this project in a more traditional way (investment) - I'm open to suggestions. Feel free to contact me using my Google profile: 
@_date: 2011-10-11 11:37:20
Well, officially it's not official or even related. I'm anything *but* official...
I'm the one who made the connection and I think it's a reasonable one, as the current monetary system will collapse sometime this decade, Bitcoin will be there to provide monetary services to earth's citizens.

@_date: 2011-09-13 13:30:10
I never said or thought that you hate it, and your questions are perfectly valid :)
You're right to mention that the web app is **sandboxed**, one of the reasons I'm chosing to work with Chrome is because of it's outstanding security features and such fast development cycles that even if there are exploits, they are fixed faster than discovered (like the case with the Iranians and the SSL certificates).
I understand that installing a web browser just to run a Bitcoin application may be unnecessary hurdle, but with all the security and ease of distribution that the Chrome Web Store provides, you can consider it as a ".NET Package" that you need to install when running a C# application. Anywhere you look in development world, unless you're working with direct machine code, your code will have dependencies.
In Safebit, the only dependency is Chrome, and I think it's pretty fast and lightweight platform for such application. Don't think of it as "another browser", you don't have to use Chrome as your browser, but Safebit needs some kind of platform to operate on, and Chrome provides that with simplicity and security. It's worth it...

Shame on the attackers? Are you high?
The problem is not the attackers and/or scammers, the problem is with half-assed, barely working, not well thought-of software that is being written for these services and being marketed as "Secure and Reliable".
I'm working on Safebit for 3 months now, and although I'm getting investors telling me that they will put down the money once I have active users, I explain to them very well that as long as I don't have proper security in place, I could not release the software (as a finished product, not alpha/preview version, which is intended for preview/testers), and I will not do that, not to compromise the bitcoins of those who trust *Safe*bit, and not to get another scandal like the current one.
Almost every **major** bitcoin business in the past 6 months was hacked, compromised, deleted, run away, or something other happened to it because of users blindly trusting something they have no information about.
Ladies, gentelmen, this is not Bitcoin7's fault, this is not MtGox's fault, it's not Tom Wagner's fault, it's not Bitomat.pl fault (should I continue?), it's *your fucking fault*. Don't trust anything with your money, isn't this the reason you're into Bitcoin in the first place?
*Sorry for the swear words, I'm being pissed at this for the past few months*
@_date: 2011-10-06 14:16:50
No, I didn't think you were referring to that. It just seemed like an appropriate response to your question and the way you've asked it.
It doesn't matter if Bitcoin will be wroth $1 or $100 or $100,000 in a few months/years. The only thing that matters to me is that it has *some* value above $0.001, and that people are finding it useful enough to spread the word.
It doesn't matter what I believe that the Bitcoin &lt;=&gt; USD exchange rate will be in 1, 10, 100 months from now, it has no real impact on Bitcoin as long it *has some value*.
Do I believe it will be worth 100x in a a few months? No, do I believe that it will be worth 100x in a few years? Yes, if it will be adopted by the general public, or at least a significant percentage of the general public (1%-2% would be great).
Now, what do you believe?
@_date: 2011-06-14 00:10:45
You are fucking kidding me, right?
I don't want to use services that take money from me for using something that is P2P and supposed to be completely free.
If I'm not wrong in my assumptions that means Bitcoin is doomed like any other ecurrency. :(
@_date: 2011-09-11 22:17:57

@_date: 2011-07-05 06:02:31
Yea, basically this will try to answer some of the shortcomings of the current Bitcoin software out there, and add functionality that will protect the lay person, so that even our moms could use and get the full advantages of Bitcoin anonymity and security.
Encryption and strong security will be a very strong consideration building the app, I'm thinking about integrating true-crypt inside the app, or something of the sorts.
@_date: 2011-07-15 19:30:20

This version is dedicated to [ttk2]( the first one to donate to this project.

@_date: 2011-07-08 14:27:59
Todamont, you might be right with the dev game, but I'm not aiming at the devs.
The devs are doing just fine on their own, the purpose of this it to get it out to more people, and make it easier to use and understand.
Doing a carbon copy of the current client with better security will lead us no where, yes it will give us better security, but the exposure level for Bitcoin will remain as it is, where I aim to make something so simply and user-friendly that even your mom could use it without trying to understand how it works.
@_date: 2011-08-15 02:43:03
You're not making a lot of sense. Listen to the guy above...
@_date: 2011-10-26 15:54:53
No, that's not the problem.
The problem is that Bitcoin is **disruptive** and people who make their living by using other people's money and exploiting the current monetary system REALLY don't want to see Bitcoin getting ANY attention what so ever. So the try to trash it like there's no tomorrow.
@_date: 2011-10-15 15:32:48

@_date: 2011-06-27 23:19:52


yea, that's where I started.


If you factor in the hardware that goes around those cards, plus electricity cost, it seems that the 6990 wins it easily, no less but doubling the cost/effectiveness. Plus, you have to deal with a lot less hardware...
*Edit*: Scratch that, I was wrong. Even with the extra hardware around it it's still more effective using the 5830.
@_date: 2011-10-18 00:48:34
And another thing comes to mind.
How volatile is *too* volatile? I mean is [this]( to Gold chart for the past year") ok? Or [this]( to USD chart for the past 6 motnhs")?
Price of EVERYTHING changes with time, the thing that you call a problem right now is the fact that speculators came in very early and drove the price to an unreasonable height, and now people say "it's too volatile!".
The only reason you think that your dollar or euro are "stable" is because a lot of people working to make it look like it's stable. Take a look at [this USD / Wheat (bu) chart]( and that's a price range between 600 and 950 USD, at the very least x20 the price of Bitcoin...

I don't get it, seriously.
Why do people like you are actively trying to "hurt" bitcoin? I mean what do you get out of saying crap like the above?
Do you have some kind of "secret details" that makes bitcoin "a pile of shit ponzi scheme that's a waste of time and money"? I mean what do you know that I don't?
And if Bitcoin is a waste of time, don't you think that those who realized it wouldn't waste their time by talking about a "pile of shit" all day long?
@_date: 2011-10-15 02:27:23
I'm actively advocating for the Ƀ symbol, and against the double-bar symbol or the single-bar (Baht) symbol.
I think the double-barred symbol looks way too *monopoly money*, and the single-barred is already used by ~~India~~ Thailand as the Baht symbol.
Ƀ has a nice clean look to it, it's easy to use (sort of: alt+0579, doesn't work everywhere, try the address bar and copy from there), it looks more *serious* and not like play money.
@_date: 2011-06-15 09:21:05

Well, I could create a public address that people will be able to deposit coins into and then when the time comes to spend them, we'll send the coins from that address to reddit's bitcoin address.
Although I like that you'r cautios let's first see if this has some traction with the subreddit users, perhaps [theymos]( - the moderator - could make an official announcement.
We can latter decide how to collect the funds in reality and how the payment will be done.

Ok, so now I know a little more about GLBSE, but still it's extremely hard to use (this is 2011, not 1981, command line?), it practically repels users instead of inviting them.
But lets assume that I do manage to overcome the hardships, and lets that my *investors* also overcome those hardships. There is still a problem of the economy that it cannot support any large projects in the near future, how does the inventors/creators of GBLSE react to that? or do they just ignore that fact and say "sure it can"?
In order for this to be a viable method of raising funds (that's the point of it, no?) it needs to be accessible to investors (which it's not), the economy needs to have the amounts needed (which it hasn't), and everything should be super clear and super easy to understand in terms of "what happens when..." (which it's not).
GBLSE is a nice idea, that is at least 3-4 years a head of it's time. At most people who use GBLSE could raise $40mil in total, and that's the ALL OF THE BITCOINS IN EXISTENCE TODAY.
And I keep being asked why I don't use GBLSE, and those who ask me  seem to ignore the above caveats.

Based on your comment, I've came up with Bitcoin Time Capsule - it's basically a donation address that 50% of the donations will go back to whoever you ask me to. So when your dad downloads the client, he will get 50% of what you donated today, even if by that time 1BTC = $100.

The code is going to be open all the way through.
I've opted for both very popular and very open technologies - Python &amp; HTML5 (Javascript, HTML, CSS). The idea is to make the client extendable, and most of the extensions that will be written will be under the same kind of license.
It's not to prevent further development or adoption by users, but rather to prevent code fragmentation having a situation similar to Linux today.
In the future, after the code-base is established, I believe that the client will become MIT licensed (my favorite license).

But what if the giant 5 would collude to work together to raise the transaction fee to something like 1% for every transaction? How would you stop it then?
Open a new mining pool? That would be pretty hard trying to compete against giants such as deepbit.
@_date: 2011-08-15 02:29:14


I think not. We're looking at the past and extrapolating to the future.
It's easy to see a non-profit organization that builds to defend bitcoin no fees transactions concept, today it could be a mining farm that is somewhat profitable, but when it becomes marginally profitable to mine this organization could sustain itself from the earlier years profits and as this will fade from donations from wealthy individuals.

But most such BitBills with a lot of coins in them will never be traded inside the block-chain, they will simply exchange hands.
Imagine this scenario of you will:
Mr. White is a drug dealer with a suite case of happy pills worth $1,000,000.
Mr. Pink wants to buy a lot of happy pills and has an untampered with bitbill with $1,000,000 worth of Bitcoin associated with it.
Mr. White will accept the bitbill given to him by Mr. Pink only if he *trusts* the company that makes BitBills that no one except the card holder has access to the private keys associated with this particular bitbill.
Mr. White can verify that what Mr. Pink tells him his true and that that particular bitbill has $1,000,000 worth of bitcoins associated with it by checking the address (public key) that is printed on the bitbill on BlockExplorer.com and see that it's all valid.
Mr. Pink exchanges his bitbill that has $1,000,000 worth of coins associated with it with the suitecase full of happy pills that Mr. White has.
Both Mr. Pink and Mr. White go out satisfied from the exchange.
Latter on Mr. White arrives to Mr. Green who is willing to give him $1,000,000 in cold hard cash in exchange for the bitbill given to him from Mr. Pink.
These two transactions are never registered any where in the world, and no one except those who do the transactions are aware of $1,000,000 changing hand twice in less than 20 minutes.
Again, that all is only possible if all the parties involved are trusting the company that manufactures BitBills that they do not keep the private keys accessible to anyone, and that BitBills are tamper proof (including creating an identical BitBill), only if this is true, than we can have BitBills to carry large sums of money in such shady exchanges.

Regarding exchanges needing a service that is irreversible - that is just a wrong way of doing business.
Bitcoin is indeed irreversible, but our current monetary system is reversible and exchanges should not use a certain service just because it promises to be irreversible (which it eventually isn't).
To protect themselves, exchanges should not allow **withdraw** from out of the exchange until the funds are fully cleared and are no longer subject to be reversed.
For example, you could get bitcoin and start trading them on MtGox right away, but if there is a waiting period of 14 days because I can call my bank and say I didn't want to send the $$$ I sent to MtGox and because of that MtGox will lose the transaction, so during the 14 days funds should not be releasable out of the MtGox account, and if there is a problem with the funds, MtGox can simply freeze the account suspected in fraud.

Hording Bitcoins is smarter than paying with them, but the fact that there are places that accept *only* bitcoins means that for some commodities you have to spend bitcoins, simply because you can't buy the goods in other currencies.
Sure, the current surge in Bitcoin is purely speculative and happens because people are hording the currency rather than actually using it, but in the long run people will use bitcoins on daily basis simply because it's possible.

True, but if you've "found" $20 on a $1 bill, it would the very least intrigue you, and if not, you'd pass it along.
Before you know it, people will start talking about those bills that have more money associated with them, and before you know it, thousands and millions of people are getting to know Bitcoin.
And if not, you can redeem your coins back, because you have the private key.
Sounds like a sweet deal to me...

Using a simple tool like JSON-RPC I think its possible to bypass the restrictions imposed by the GUI client (not really sure if that's correct).


True, I extrapolated based on the fact that the average block is 10k, and there are around 130K blocks right now.
@_date: 2011-08-10 13:15:14
Yes, but that exactly what I mean. The exchanges are aware of those issues with services like Dwolla that are not particularly *instant* and they become very expensive if you're waiting 7 days for your transfer to clear and the coins are rising or dropping 50% during that time.
Why aren't the exchanges encourage people to use the banking system? I'm sure that if we look hard enough we can find a cheap way to transfer funds to and from exchanges.

Ummm, if I read it right, than he didn't actually show why Bitcoin is impossible, it showed that it *could* potentially collapse on itself, and that it currently works.
The two reasons he used to show that Bitcoin has a potential of failing are:
 A single entity that has 50% (he wrongly suggested 110%) or more of the total power can destabilize and defraud the system
It would be hard to do. No, actually if an entity like Google decide to play games on us, it could easily use 1% of it's computer power to completely take over the system.
But the moment that happens, it means that they care enough to do so, and if Google cares enough about Bitcoin, it means a lot of people will find out about the coin and will start using it, and after a small while there will be enough indy miners that overtake Google even if they employ more than 50% of their computational power, simply because bitcoin would be popular and hence will be expensive.
Sure, a hidden super power (read: not Google) could destabilize the network without getting too much attention towards Bitcoin, and would effectively kill the currency. But this can only happen when the currency is young, and it's a risk we're all taking.
 Bitcoin developers are actually the ones controlling Bitcoin
It's not exactly true. They have some control, but the users my chose *not to update their client* if and when they decide that what the developers did is not something they agree with.
In essence they will continue to use Bitcoin, while the Bitcoin developers will btanch to a new virtual currency.
The thing is that Bitcoin is *not*  it's an idea which is executed in a variety of ways (There is the official Bitcoin client, and there is the java one, for example), and the only thing that makes them all work together is the agreement of which rules to use - the one that decided not to follow the rules is a minority, and all the computational power in the world will not help him.
@_date: 2011-07-05 05:53:48

@_date: 2011-08-11 01:03:17
Ok, thinking about this a lot and reading the comments in this post really make me wonder.
Dwolla may be working for some at a pretty OK level. Not many complaints actually. The problem that all users agree on is that it's *slow*. Sometimes it takes a weak or so to clear a transaction.
The reason Exchanges encourage users to use Dwolla, as I see it, is because they are not well organized to open up bank accounts around the world to allow people to transfer cash within the country, and by that avoiding extremely high fees when going from currency to currency in local banks, and they basically use Dwolla because it has, what, an easy API for developers?
So this is what I'm thinking:
1. Most bank transfer clear in less than 24 hours when it's inside the country, and around 48 hours if it's outside the country.
2. Dwolla like any other financial institution requires it's users to identify, and that adds more time to the process of acquiring bitcoins, and usually is not attributed to the total time it takes
3. Most people have a bank account which already identifies them
4. Canceling wire transfers are extremely hard, at least from my own experience
5. For a regulated company there are tools and applications that allow it to connect to a bank and receive information about incoming and outgoing transactions
6. The current exchanges do not use banks because that will mean they will have to provide legal details and information about themselves that will require them to take liability for the large sums of money that goes through the exchanges
If I don't have any mistakes - this sounds like a bad bad idea.
@_date: 2011-10-18 00:37:49
So you're saying that the "current" bitcoin iteration has a problem of price volatility and that it doesn't have enough good tools?
How would you suggest stopping price volatility for the next iteration of Bitcoin (or however you are going to name it)? How are you going to solve the problem of lacking good tools in its early days?
I know! How about letting someone like Facebook manage it for us, and keeping the price at a certain level, and also creating all the greeeeeeaaaattt tools that Facebook knows how to do? This could work! I shall name it *The Bookcoin*

Safebit [Bitcoin Wallet]( is [open-source](


I understand the difficulties of re-implementing the code that is calculating the chain and validating everything, that's why I'm concentrating on the usability aspect of Bitcoin by developing the front-facing code rather than the back-end.

@_date: 2011-10-16 02:15:46
Should it?
@_date: 2011-08-11 17:37:10
Why use ACH charges? [ACH chargs are clearly designed to prevent people from trading money]( rather than improving the infrastructure.
Using a [wire transfer]( is a bit costly initially, setting up a few people to sit next to the bank website and seeing that transactions are cleared, but they are far more secure and less likely to have charge-backs associated with them, it's a lot harder to cancel/void a wire transfer than an ACH charge.
So basically the exchanges today are no good for Bitcoin, they are only preventing progress because they are not interested in investing the needed funding for making a solid, trustworthy, reputable, exchange.
I'm putting up 10 BTC for a business entrepreneur that will create the next *trustworthy* exchange that utilizes the best available tools in order to get people into Bitcoin as fast as possible.

Volatility is a problem, indeed. But it's not a *major* problem.
Business that want to accept Bitcoins can request payment based on the current exchange rates, and as soon as payment is transferred exchanging those coins to stupid money.
The problem begins when a customers buys a bunch of coins at say $15 a pop, and than wants to buy something while the value drops to, say, $7.5 a pop. Now he actually has half of what he bought.
On the other hand, if a customer buys coins now, and wants to pay for something in 20-30 days from now, he'll probably get the services 1/2 or 1/4 of the actual cost, so the customer wins.
If the business "believes" in Bitcoin, he can than hold on to those coins, or continue paying someone else or for something else with those coins without exchanging them to stupid money.
For the business the risk is minimal if it exchanges Bitcoins right away. Minimal but still existing. Would you rather work with paypal who can simply close your account if they wish so? or would you prefer to work with dowalla who will occasionally take your money back because a customer complained? In my opinion the risk of volatility outweighs the risk of getting your funds frozen.
If you're into bitcoin suck it up and learn how to handle these coins at this uber-early stage. Volatility is a non-issue as long as you can exchange coins almost instantly.
@_date: 2011-10-26 15:53:22
Yes. Please do :)
What I marvel more than everything about Bitcoin is that no matter how much negative publicity (read: shit) bitcoin is getting, no one has actually came up with a REAL reason why Bitcoin is dead/not working/scam/etc' etc'.

It's not a financial tracking, it's just a way to create "compartments" for your money. You could just ignore it and live with only one "compartment".
The Future Payments thingy is a must as far as I can see, people do need an option to be able to pay something every month or every week without thinking about it too much. Try to think about stuff like buying a domain and hosting, were you don't want to pay in advance, but you do want to pay once a month for the hosting.
There are a lot of other examples where you need monthly payments.
And protection and encryption will be the top priority of this wallet.
@_date: 2011-08-11 19:21:26
Yes, agreed.
As long as BitBills provides sufficient information and access to their facilities and also inspection of said facilities by a trusted third party (attorneys and professionals), it could work.
You don't need to have faith in the idea, you need to have faith in service providers that you already trust.
@_date: 2011-09-11 18:20:47
What's wrong with a web app? What's the difference between a web-app and a "stand alone" app?
Again, I'm not a great believer in *Security by Obscurity* so even if it's a web app (Javascript) with the source completely open, it just means that finding and taking care of bugs would be a lot easier and a lot more people could jump in and start working without worrying about compiling the code, cross-platform compatibility and so on.
At this stage Safebit can be launched on any HTML5 supported device, including iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod), Android (phones/tablets), XBOX360, Sony Playstation, and obviously any computer OS (Windows, Linux, and Mac). This makes total sense for me as a developer - write once, support everybody. This makes sense also in the long run, as we know that this technology is not going anywhere, and if anything it's only getting better (soon you'll be able to run native C code directly from a Chrome extension...), so unless I get a compelling argument *against* Safebit being a web-app, it will continue being a web-app as it has a lot of advantages and almost no disadvantage (unless you consider security by obscurity).
Makes sense?

That's my main problem with Bitcoin - trying to explain it.
Come to think about it, not a lot of people actually *understand* the US Dollar or any other currency, they just use it without thinking about the logic behind, and trust it because, well, it was there before they were, so it's probably a good thing and we can simply trust it, and give most of what they make to other people who do understand how it all works and control this system.
But with Bitcoin, `a)` we feel obligated to try to explain, and `b)` *outsiders* are very suspicious of this idea, and demand an explanation from us, when most of the time we're dealing with people who'd have trouble understanding simpler concepts than `crypto-currency` (any one of those is a huge subject on it's own that not many understand or even know about) - and this comes after a month+ in everything-bitcoin and countless lost hours of sleep because of bitcoin and I'm still not sure if I understand bitcoin in full...
So the idea is to make an *iPhone* - introduce a new technology that will simply be useful without trying to explain how it works. And we have the upper hand because we already have some traction for bitcoin ($30~ monthly in exchange alone, not including hardware bought for mining, man-hours of programming, researching, design, just talking about it, or investing time reading and learning it), so as I see we have a critical mass to start spreading it, but the problem is that everything-bitcoin looks like it came from the early 90's internet, so it has no appeal to your mom or dad.
@_date: 2011-10-15 02:44:58
True, but like me there are hundreds if not thousands of developers working on Bitcoin projects right now. Bitcoin is gaining momentum and is at the *early adopters phase*, and those who risk a little now *may be* rewarded greatly for that, and *may* lose everything they invested.

Yes, but at early stages the multiplier could be higher.


Yes, the return is decided based on the initial investment and it's multiplier. So say you have $200 you want to invest, and you set your multiplier to 25, that's $2,500.


No. Unlike traditional stocks, investors don't get to continue profiting from someone else's work.  With this model the investor asks for a particular ROI, or "Exit" that he'd like. For example a traditional VC that invests in $500,000 would like to see a ROI of $50,000,000, i.e. 100 times multiplier.
If I as the business owner accept such a "loan", or "investment", under those terms, that's the "exit" for the investor. He doesn't need to wait until the company is sold or does an IPO. The company is public from day 1.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming *all the users of Bitcoin7*, I'm blaming **us**, the early adopters who *should* check and verify those service for the rest of the community, who *should* make sure that the services out there are trustworthy enough, who *should* notify the community if there is a problem.
I'm blaming the community that isn't doing enough to make sure that whoever enters Bitcoin at this point in time is realizing the **risks** involved.
Like Bruce Wagner, who promoted MyBitcoin.com (not going into whether he is or isn't Tom Williams) without checking *who are the people* that are behind it, *what is the code* that makes it work, and *what are the people who run it do to make sure that our coins won't disappear one day*, and also *what will they do when the shit hits the fan*. These are questions that the hard-core Bitcoin fans (like 60% of the Bitcointalk.org, and you and I) should be asking themselves and then publishing the results.
There are great tools out there, there are great technologies out there that could make Bitcoin based business run as secure as it needs to be, but the business developers that create the current batch of Bitcoin services are not adopting it fast enough, and are not willing to share the code with the community, and in turn it makes them an easy target.
Share the code - get free QA and bugfixes, dont share the code - and you'll have a giant target on your back. The bugs will be there any way, and they will be discovered one way or the other, I would much rather that the users of Safebit would discover a vulnerabilities rather than some malicious attacker who will steal coins from my users.
Bitcoin hard-core fans and developers are to blame for this, not Bitcoin7 and not the users who use it blindly without getting the information they need to decide if they want to work with that service or not.

First of all - thanks to all of you who donated! You are the reason that this project is growing.
I'll be making a thank-you page soon with credits to all the donations - if you have a link you would like to add to your donation - let me know!
# License and Source Code
Safebit is an open-source project. This is money we're talking about, and I wouldn't trust any wallet out there that is closed source, and neither should you. One of the reasons that I support Bitcoin so strongly is because of it's complete transparency.
You can visit  for yourself and check out the code - it's in early development stages, so don't expect to find more than just code - and see for yourself that this is nothing but some hacked up Python with HTML/JS/CSS wrapped in nicely.
# Technology
The idea is to make this easily extendable by other developers, and HTML5 and Python are on the top 5 list of most popular technologies out there.
I'm not a CS graduate, and my knowledge in Python is lacking, so at the moment my bitcoin wallet is basically a web-app that communicated with the regular bitcoin client that you can download from bitcoin.org using JSON-RPC. This may change in the future, but it's not one of my primary goals.
# Su[p]( omitted P is intentional. On the website it's a type-o")ort the project
If you like the work I'm doing, spread the word! The more people know about this, the more people will donate, the faster this project will become a reality!
@_date: 2011-07-05 01:02:19

You realize that you're not helping in any way, right?
A. People don't use linux because it runs only 10% (and over-estimation, I'm sure) of the available tools. People who work on jobs that are unrelated to development or maintenance of tools that *can* be used on Linux don't use Linux. They use Windows or Macs. Their job depend on tools like Photoshop.
B. Linux is not user friendly. It's not that Windows is such a great UX experience, but at least it's easy enough to work with. And Macs are just designed for people. (I'm a PC person myself)
C. Fragmentation is making the use of Linux hell. Get your shit together and make simple standards that developers and users can use. I don't care what Ubuntu I'm running, I just want to fix my god damn audio, and install a particular application.
In Linux for every problem you need a resolution for every distro out there, in Windows or Mac you atleast have just Windows or Mac, and most problem solving revolve around just one platform eventually (not taking into consideration legacy and/or historic versions).
So it's great that you use linux, but you can afford that and have the patience to learn how to do stuff in linux (or at least at some point in life had), most people don't have those two. Enjoy your linux, keep our servers and important stuff secure, but please stop thinking that those who do not use linux are stupid and that you are going to change them with those stupid "Linux is AWESEOMME" comments, they don't work.
People like you are just annoying, and not helping Linux in any way or form.

What if Bitcoin is not a currency? What if Bitcoin for this matter is a simple *commodity* that you can buy and transfer between users?
Currency, by Wikipedia, is described as:


So by that standard Gold is currency, right? Gold is allowed by Google checkout.
Stop calling it *currency*, and you can slip through a lot of securities.

Yes, I am doing the computations in PHP. I'm not actually expect to find any bitcoins, I'm just trying to understand the process of doing so, and PHP is my programming *native language*, so it's easier for me to understand the ins and outs.
Yes, I am looking at other miners, but I'm not really getting a hell of a lot out of it, especially because they are written in a way that is designed to *work* rather than being readable or understandable (especially for those who are not familiar with the programming language in question), and as you've stated, PHP mining is extremely inefficient, but it's still important for me to learn...

Umm, how exactly am I going to pay off 1,000BTC with the $20 I get as payment?
Shifting the decimal point will make it a different number, I cannot sell "1000 Bitcoins" and actuall sell 0.1, 0.01, or even 1 Bitcoin with that, it's a fraud...
The idea it self sounds interesting (buy $20 worth of Bitcoins for $25, if read your comment correctly), basically a pre-loaded Bitcoin client.
Not bad...

How does installation got anything to do with being cross-platform? And in order to run Java apps you need to have JVM installed, and usually it doesn't come preinstalled, while web technologies do not require you to install anything.
Are you referring to the fact that you need to install the official client to run Safebit? if so than it's a matter of time. I'm just one man working on this massive project, and I'm doing what I'm good at, and at this point it's not writing C++ code...
If the browser you're using is compromised than stuff like PayPal and Google Checkout and eBay and Amazon and a lot of other "browser apps" will be compromised, and I don't think that the guys at Google take it lightly...

Yeap, I have to agree with you. Predictions should take into account all the variables, and if they didn't come true they simply didn't come true.
And no, I'm not sure that it will rise that high in a month. Last month when I made that "prediction" I was a little n00bish with everything Bitcoin and also general economics, this time around I think it will rise to some level, but $100/1BTC is a little out there.

That's what I was thinking when trying to understand how would a serious bitcoin exchange would operate.
Open bank accounts anywhere where there is demand for coins, and use those account to send and receive funds.
I used to work for a ForEX company a while back, and that's how they did business, and it works pretty damn well.
Sure there are higher fees, but if you keep your money inside the system (i.e. don't convert bitcoins to fiat currency) those fees are neglectable.
I would imagine myself putting $2k - $3k into Bitcoin and using that to buy stuff around the Bitcoin world. when you look at a $10 fee for transferring $2k it suddenly looks like the $0.25 fee that you get when transferring funds using Dwolla. i.e. negligible

The *official* (I'm not really sure how official it is...) symbol is impossible to make with regular fonts, and Ƀ is simply ALT+0579 (if you get C than try that in the address bar, and copy it from there). And I use it regularly since I discovered it, and looks a lot more like real currency symbol, while the *official* one looks like monopoly money.

@_date: 2011-09-14 02:15:20
I'll try to TL;DR the thing.
Instead of investing "privately" the company is public from the get go. Instead of waiting for an Exit (sell the company, IPO) the investors sets the ROI he wants from the very beginning, and that's his "exit". Each investor can decide how much he wants in return for his investment (very similar to "stocks for cash" - the earlier the investor joins, the higher return he can ask for).
@_date: 2011-09-25 09:43:58
Thanks. That could be a good starting point.

How is that? Let me know what poses the risk in your opinion so I can try and lower it.
You can always check the code and see that it does only what it says it does and nothing more, it's all open source and even as an application running in chrome you can go to your extensions directory and see the code for yourself.

@_date: 2011-10-17 17:24:20
Ok, here's my take on this "the value is dropping".
Demand is low, it always been low, but in the last 6 months or so people "believed" that it will sky-rocket in the next X days/weeks/months, so they bought them whenever they could.
Supply is high, miners now have Bitcoins that are worth 1/10th of what it was when they first entered the Mining business, and they are trying to get as much as possible return on their investment, so they are pouring all they have to the market.
If Bitcoin was a regulated currency, like the USD for example, the production would stop as there is no actual need for new currencies, and right now were feeling an effect named "inflation" - more money than needed (or can be supported) is flowing in to the market, so it's overall value drops.
Bitcoin is not a regulated currency, it can't just *stop* production because there is enough coins in the market, and there aren't too many services and/or products that are sold with Bitcoins.
Another cause for the drop is the fact that some people simply *sit* on their coins hoping they will appreciate in value in the next X days/weeks/months. That I think is the main cause for the price drop, not the fact that there is *too much coins* out there.
If Bitcoin would not have seen as a "great investment" in the past 6 months, investors wouldn't have bought bitcoin, and we wouldn't have that steep of a bubble like we did when 1Ƀ was $30, and regular people (that can't afford buying crap load of coins) would have simply bought a few, and the value would steadily rise to what it really should be.
Another problem - everybody is afraid that Bitcoin is loosing it's value - it's not. It's losing it's value because there is *less demand* for bitcoin, so those who want to sell it because they worked to get them and now want to pay bills are now selling at whatever they can get.
But what is the value of Bitcoin? I don't know. I know that when Bitcoin hits $2 mark, I'm going to buy a few hundreds of them, you know, to use them latter (not hoping that it will rebound to $30 and I will get easy money...).
In a sentence, if you want Bitcoin to work, start using it. Stop whining that it needs adoption, stop whining that it's value is dropping, stop whining that the price is too low or too high, just use the damn thing.
Ask your local dealers/shops/service providers whatever it is to adopt bitcoin and start accepting them, educate your immediate surroundings, and those who find Bitcoin useful will use it because they find it *useful*, and not because *it's cool*.
Remember, *cool* and *useful* are both relative terms, Bitcoin was cool a few months ago, but it's far from useful right now. The only ones who can change that are us, the early adopters.
Stop whining about the price of bitcoin, it's irrelevant. Start using bitcoin, that's the only way to actually help it.

That makes perfect sense, and I see the point of having such *banks* to help with transactions, but I still hate the idea of losing the option of using Bitcoin as it was designed to because of something like huge files.
As I see it I will use those kind of banks to have a small amount of my Ƀ as *cash*, whereas the rest of my funds will be sitting in a secure Bitcoin wallet that only I have access to, that's one of the most appealing aspects of Bitcoin...

Yea, I was waiting for your reply actually, and good thing you did.
Roger Wagner (form [The Bitcoin Show]( ) actually made a similar statement (he admits it in ep 14 or 15, not sure exactly).
I think the $30 / Ƀ1 bubble at the start of the month and the flash-crash due to MtGox hack a couple of weeks ago hampered Bitcoin's ability to rise. With the influx of new Bitcoin users I believe that we're not far from the $100 / Ƀ1 mark (another month? ;)).
@_date: 2011-07-30 13:59:54
Because the numbers don't add up.
For example in my data I have a weekly market volume of $11,650K, times 4.5 (four and a half weeks in a month) it comes out to $52,425K, or $52.5 mil/month.
And the data on Bitcoincharts.com says the last 30 days volume is $14mil.

The links have nothing to do with Bitcoin, is somebody using the popularity that bitcoin gets to advertise their site or testing how people are actually interested in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2011-07-05 15:03:35
Oh, now I understand the latter comment.
a) I think we're talking about to different solutions: 1. move the decimal point back and make 1 (my app) Bitcoin = 0.001 (current) Bitcoin, effectively inflating the currency (yesterday's Bitcoin is today's 1000 Bitcoins, inflation), and 2. shift the focus from Bitcoin to Millis (or whatever they are named) - using mB or some other notation as a standard.
b) considering the above, the first solution is not valid (in my opinion at least), because this is a basic inflation, and this will cause a lot of confusion especially if my client does get popular (say 20%-25% market share) - when I'll ask for support for the project, and I ask for "only" 1 Bitcoin, how much would people exactly pay? $13 or $0.013?
The second option is what I meant, and would effectively make Bitcoin like a $1,000 bill, and that will happen anyway if bitcoin become more popular, and will not cause any confusion - there is already some census about Millis (mB) and I've heared of other sub-millis names and nicknames.

That's a pretty wild assumption.
Only a handful of GPUs are capable of 50Mh/s and there aren't that many people with GPUs. And even so it's an opt-in, you will have a very low acceptance rate.
Doing mining over the browser is extremely inefficient in any other way but Java, and I don't see Java doing a comeback just because of Bitcoin mining...

Sorry, I'm not a great believer in competing block chains. They all just seem that they are trying to be Satoshi.
Like people have already told to the SolidCoin dev: start contributing code to the original client or provide other tools for Bitcoin. Alternative block-chains has little-to-no chance of being successful at any time span. The only way an alternative chain can be successful is if Bitcoin has such a serious flaw that everybody needs to flee to another block-chain to continue using the technology. That's not happening any time soon, right?

The original idea belongs to Eyal Hartzog, one of the founders of Meta Cafe.
I've meet Eyal a few days ago, and we both really like the concept and started developing it further.
I've started writing [an overview]( of the entire process, and I'd like to hear your take on this and the OBB model as a whole.
Please note that Open *Bitcoin* Business is not the best name for this, imho, and it should be named something like **Open Business** or **Open Company**, because it has not a lot to do with Bitcoin directly.

Definitely. I'm still unsure of all the tech that's going to go into Safebit, as you can see I'm just getting started and there is a lot of work.

Because it's hard to understand and no one makes an effort to make it easy to use?
What the hell is it? how does it work? who invests in it?
If it's works just for Bitcoin, than it wouldn't work for a business that needs an excess of a million dollars as an investment. That would be 1/40 of the entire Bitcoins in existence.
I don't see a scenario where the economy can support a single project at 1/40th of it's total value, it's just not feasible.

Some initial math:
- 1 Reddit Gold for 1 month = $3.99
- 5,051 r/Bitcoin subscribers
- 1 BTC = $10.7 = 2.68 Reddit Gold
- 5,000 Reddit gold = $19,950 = 1,864 BTC
What I'm thinking of is getting a bunch of us to raise any number of bitcoins up to 1,864 bitcoins it total, and saying to conde nast that we have $20k worth of reddit gold, all they need is to accept it in bitcoins.
What we gain is a bunch of us will get reddit gold, if we raise a substantial amount, or even cover for everyone, than we could say that it's the first gold subreddit, and that would get some more interest in bitcoin from reddit users.
I currently have 16.82 bitcoin in total, and that I've raised through Safebit, if I put down 7.4 coins to buy 20 reddit golds, that's 0.4% of the total amount needed, or roughly 200 redditors like me.

Did you know that 99% of the people that say "retard" all the time are fucking assholes?
And the issue is not whether *retarded* users should or should not download bitcoin to their computer, what I'm saying is that it will be *impossible* to do so in a few years.
I think you're missing the point of bitcoin, it's aimed much much higher than SUPREME TECH-SAVVIES like yourself to use, the beauty of it is that it's aimed to replace fiat currencies you fucking dumb ass[.](/"sorry, slipped.")
And I think the way you write can explain pretty well why you are still stuck at a call-center fixing someones email.
P.S. You're a dumbass and an asshole.

The problem is not with the statement of Full Anonynimity, the problem is with implementation of these features.
Bitcoin does offer full anonymity, the things is the tools that people use should provide *easy* ways to enforce full anonymity.
For example, whenever you send a coins to someone, the tools that you're using should **by default** use a scrambling function, that will send coins from the senders address to a 3rd party while at the same time 3rd party sends coins to the destination address.
It does requires a third party, but this 3rd party can be controlled by the users themselves without compromising their funds (or trusting a 3rd party).
For me, enforcing anonymity should be inherent in every tool that uses bitcoin. It's something that is the responsibility of the developers, not the users.
@_date: 2011-09-25 03:47:14
Not exactly.
Moving to another pool when you need to compete with giants would be hard, as you would get a lot less as an indy miner or indy pool, because they will get a lot less processing power over a given time.
Percentage fees could be easily written inside bitcoin clients if/when the pool request to do so. The possibility of it frightens me...

Like a baby, it will never be the right time.
I disagree on that, *the time is now* as they say. Bitcoin is ready, it's just that the people who are in it at the moment aren't prepared for that.
Like with the internet boom 15-or-so years ago, when people just began to understand the possibilities and it rapidly changed everything we know now about our society, so is bitcoin, not everybody realizes that, but *now* is the time of the early Bitcoin era, it doesn't mean it cannot sustain large economy, it just means that the economy isn't large yet.
As soon as the ecosystem of Bitcoin grows beyond the number of users it now has (just look at the number of user on the sidebar here, and see that it's technically stopped growing) we'll going to see larger and more sophisticated businesses start using Bitcoin. It's just the nature of things.
Bitcoin is ready for prime time, and not just that, this is the prime time of Bitcoin, and development will become quicker as more money goes into developing Bitcoin related applications and technologies.

Outside of the Crypto space the odds of a business surviving its first year are, at best, one out of ten. It's actually closer to 1/100.
Of course you have tons of crap not worth touching with a ten foot pole, but that's true everywhere as well, but the fact is that the next Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddits haven't arrived yet, and once they will, they will no doubt do an ICO, and I hopefully will be there to buy their token. and with me millions of people like me who will do the same thing.
The next billion dollars will be raised from the general population, not high-profile investment firms (although they will probably participate just the same).

That we're in for a great few years - the .com bubble was all about the whales getting in, this time it's everybody's game - like the quoted message says - "it's like the .com bubble only not regulated" -  no regulation means way more money is going to pour into the economy, from people like me and you.

As opposed to the organic value rise? Isn't crazy people that do [tattoos]( and yell crazy shit about something is actually part of the organic growth of a thing?
I mean, the more people are in to this thing, the crazier it become, because you simply have more people, and there is a fixed amount of crazies in a society, and when a large portion of the society likes something (organic), some of those crazies are in that part of society.

As someone who truly appreciates the working souls behind Ripple.com, I think Ripple.com is one of those "too soon for its time" cases.
Ripple requires me to trust *someone*, while bitcoin requires me to trust *math*. If I don't trust anyone, I still can use Bitcoin, but can I use Ripple?
On top of that, why isn't ripple.com server is open sourced from the start? Why is the creation of the initial XPRs are centralized? Why can't we all participate?
I've been hearing about Ripple ever since Stephan Thomas abandoned BitcoinJS and started working on Ripple.com, and a few times before that, but I have yet been able to see the benefit of Ripple over Bitcoin.
Bitcoin killer? I wouldn't bet on it. A good POC that might be used at some point in the future? Perhaps. StrongCoin all over again? maaaaayyyybbbeeee...

Also, I've seen this coincidentally while recording a podcast, and at first it looked like an attack on the blockchain, with huge numbers running on the front-page of blockchain.info with the (bitcoin-24.com) tag attached to them, which got me thinking into maybe they're using the blockchain to advertise that they're open for business?

The "fee-less" TX was my own (0.002048) to make sure that it all works (sorry, I'm a bit skeptic myself, and don't really want to lose my coins because of a new place that not 100% sure how to work with bitcoin yet, and plus I don't trust myself enough yet, and not the software I'm running...).
Also I opted to not add the fee to the TX to see how it works, and apperantly MultiBit doesn't show the TX without fees, unless it gets confirmations (which didn't happen for that small text TX I did prior to paying), so all in all it seems that the best way to go about accepting/paying bitcoins in situations like that is to require the sender to add the TX fee, otherwise it may take a while to show up on the various bitcoin wallets, and that could cause problems for the venue and the customer.

Friday night I had an idea, let's popularize Bitcoin by putting a tattoo on someone with the Bitcoin symbol. So immediately, as I usually do with my bright ideas, I shouted out in a bitcoin chat that I would give 2 BTC to the first guy with a bitcoin tattoo on him.
Not a minute later, someone in the chat shouts he'll do it. Let's call him Satoshis' Disciple.
We've started chatting, and decided on a design for a tattoo ([the original design]( and after the design was agreed upon, we agreed that I'll be covering some of the costs of the tattoo itself on top of the 2 BTC (that's the extra 1.84), and he told me he'll be in touch.
A few hours later, I see a message with him sending me a pic, which I didn't get in time, so I just thought he came up with a new design, but nope. The guy just delivered, and sent me an imgur link. I almost lost my shit. :)
Best. 3.84 BTC. Ever.

It's in the UTF table already, unused, as far as we know, unlike the Baht symbol, or the yet-to-exists double-barred B.
IMO the double-barred B just looks like monopoly money, amaturish. The Baht symbol is currently used by the Baht, a currency that has nothing to do with Bitcoin, and it's already causing problems, and because Ƀ just looks professional, reminds me of the Euro visually, and easy to produce in a computer (ALT+0579), a thing we use to interact with bitcoin.

Once the transaction is made, it shows up in their wallet (MultiBit) instantaneously, so the payment is "verified" practically the second you click on the "Send" button in your wallet. Seriously, standing next to the computer with MultiBit installed, running Blockchain.info app on my android, I clicked "Send" and before the screen on my phone refreshed, the TX showed up on their computer. Seriously "Instant", I was impressed myself...

Two-three years ago a well respected group of angels would've been proud raising $150mm for their fund.
Now the new kids on the block get $150mm without needing the VCs or angels along the way. That's not to say that angels and VCs didn't participate or help some of the ICOs, but they're definitely not in the same seat they were two years ago, and with the rate things are going, they will be pushed even further back.
All the while the banks are still scrambling to understand what's going on, the angels and VCs are becoming rapidly redundant, an industry, or rather a neiche​, that nobody expected to be a victim of the crypto revolution.

You can theoretically (and probably practically too) dig out the infrmation yourself by looking at previous owners, as I assume he uses the address that was used to pay for the gem to identify and name the owner.

They opted to use a combination of tools, using the blockchain.info wallet and the MultiBit wallet.
Basically they have a dedicated computer sitting right next to the main register, and whenever a customer asks to pay with Bitcoin they calculate on the fly the amount of coins the customer needs to pay relative to the Shekel (the Israeli currency), and they have a small QR code on every menu with the venues Bitcoin address, so when they have the right amount, they just tell the customer to scan the QR code, and send them the amount in BTC equivalent to the amount in shekels.
Once the customer pays (with whatever wallet software he may chose), the TX shows up in the computer next to the register, and they then know that the customer has paid his bill, and the business transaction is over.
Rather simple - you don't need any special software or hardware, they use a six or seven year old computer to host the Bitcoin wallet (those old comps are usually dirt cheap and even free sometimes) and the software is obviously free and open source.

Some guys here worked really hard to push it for over two years, and I can only salute them as I imagine how much *fun* it is to be turned down time after time by a service you love for doing something you think is important.
Reddit is really just an early adapter here, they've seen that the world is going in the Bitcoin direction (reminder: Wordpress went Bitcoin before reddit did), and decided that although it's still early to get on the bandwagon, they're up for it (especially with the hundreds of promised gold accounts on the various threads here on ).
But then again, Reddit is not just Conde Nast, Reddit is all of us. So, yes, I guess you're right.

Done eating, asked for the cheque, told them I want to pay with Bitcoin (I was the first one to actually get it done), they got my check with the amount of bitcoins I need to pay on it, and told me to scan the QR code attached - I did, the TX went through, and that was that.

Funding projects like [Safebit](
Although I'm the creator of the project above (and you should also check the Angel.co page, if you know what I'm talking about) and very proud of it, and believe it can do a lot of good for Bitcoin, with all due respect I don't think there anything you **need** to do to make sure it survives. Satoshi has made sure that it will, as it seems to be.
That being said, Safebit is designed to be super-simple, easy-to-use, extendable, uber secure aimed for the masses. I think done right, bitcoin can be very easy to use by anyone, and when I say use, it's not only about sending and receiving bitcoins, it's about making multi-sig transactions easy to use, it's about using the built-in escrow mechanisms straight forward, it's about making backups and securing your bitcoin an effortless task, and Safebit will be all of that, and more.
So yea, I'm looking for an investment for Safebit. Let me know if it's up your ally.

It is being widely used. Not as much as the double-barred symbol and the Baht symbol, but it's gaining attention and usage. And since Bitcoin is open-source and democratic, there is no meaning for the word "official" in the context of Bitcoin, and anyone is free to chose their tools and designs.
I suggest that you open any issue from the Bitcoin Magazine in the past 6 months, and you'll see a lot of Ƀ along with the Baht and double-barred symbol.
