So yes if you want to I just checked it. I would buy now. It's at a all time high in terms of the USD. Really nice side way action for at least a week. Should return to 1.7 cents, information at coingecko.com

I was new to Silk Road and my friend in Texas told me about it. I was like "bitcoin?"it takes 24 hours to post to your wallet my friend said. I used Western union at the time.I was so sketched out about it that I had doubts about it when I first paid $75 bucks,had 4 bitcoin in my wallet and well basically I saved the coins in my old phone and got spooked one day, and threw my phone away. Long story short I didn't have a package show up so I thought "oh the cops know" turns out I was wrong and it was lost in the mail. 
Lost 4 bitcoins when Silk Road shut down. My dumb ass send the coins to my online wallet. I was so pissed two years later and saw how they went way up in price. Now I use nice hash and have like 4 bucks. Mining with a gtx 1060 and a i5660k I make 2.10 some days and 1.80 on others. 
Honestly it made me throw up. I was so pissed. I could have had what 16k maybe by now if I just had waited. But at that time I had no idea how it worked and only thought it was a way of "hiding ones ass"...
Didn't even know there was a thing called "crypto currency". 
Basically have the same feeling for ripple so I bought quite a bit in the last week and now I'm waiting. Lol
