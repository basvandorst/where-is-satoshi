In some ways I wish we could leave behind the notion of citizenship, however it will only ever be a wish in my life time. Cultures fundamentally clash and mixing clashing cultures is a recipe for disaster.
I dont think its wise. I think its true. And whether you like it or not you are a slave. Dont obay the state then the state will punish you, and its inescapable. The only thing you can do is choose what state has rules that you would like to play by.

Me and the other guy are talking about the UK not the USA bucko. Here you get given rights willy nilly. I know in the USA its reasonably harder to become a citizens and for tbe most part legal immigrants in the USA are great people. But thats precisely because of the strict laws for citizenship.
The problem in the USA is illegal immigrants from the south, black supremacy and clashes between the ultra religious and the non religious.
And yes the USA is a diverse nation. One thats crumbling from within if you are to belive any part of the political spectrum.
About the children, thats what i was implying when i said partner, instead of something like "even kids with a singular japanese parent wont be japanese"
But another key point about that, the child once grown must be loyal to Japan first, and as such must choose between Japanese citizenship or forigne ones. Again unless they have strong ties to Japan and Japans way if life they are outcast as forign
A house devided against itself cannot stand.
And something to mention social security is little more than a state owned private pension (and health insursnce, locstion dependent)

I live in london, a city that 7 years ago was just over 10% muslim. I promise you that number has grown quite a bit bucko. And is that not worse? That this is how illiberal islam is even in the west?

Minimum 5 years in Japan
Renounce all other citizenships
Clean criminal record
Self reliant.
Compared to the UK where this argument is centered around this is incredibly strict. But its good, it ensures that Japanese people consider themselfs Japanese first and foremost. I dont belive someone can truly be a dual citizen.
No slave can serve two masters.

Only recently thanks to this thread lmao

Pal, I have grown up around Islam, and  I know my fair share of both muslims and "muslims" and they are not the same groups at all, most "muslims" only claim the faith so their family wont hate them. Any koran adherent  muslim will tell you exactly what apostates deserve.
And yes we can say who is, and is not part of the religion.
I say im a christian. Does that make me one now? Clearly not. I dont follow any of the fundamental tenants of the religion.

Except the lactose intolerant person would probably find it funny, a muslim would never take that as a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:58:31
Truly wise words my friend. Its nice to see someone who doesnt hold such resentment for those with a headstart.

Ah yes. China is dying. South Korea is dying. Saudi Arabia is dying. Russia is dying. Poland is dying. Hungary is dying. India is dying. 
And ofc the USA, UK, Germany, France, Sweden, Canada, Israel/Palestine, all doing better than ever right?

Haha diet nazi is a new one.
And? Would there be something wrong with that? Its not racist since i would like for other races to have their own homelands too.
@_date: 2018-09-24 11:00:33
Please explain to me how wanting people to be free to be surounded by their own culture, regardless of what culture they are from, is racist?
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:41:35
Ah yes like Sweden? Id just love to live in Neu-Mecca
Oh wait am i not suposed to call it that yet? I ment to say Stockholm!

Thats the beauty of it. Its indiscriminate. All non japanese are kept firmly in the outsider group, unless they prove they have integrated they cannot obtain citizenship. And integration normaly entails marrying a citizen and living there for many years, without it no benifits are afforded to you, and you and your partner live there and have kids they aren't citizens either.
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:50:32
I think the legal imigration is a success in the USA, however they imported millions of people who didnt want to integrate and used them as slave labour and also hispanic imigration control is a joke. With states protecting criminals from the federal government.
And yes black supremacy was a very wide spread thing, And you could argue  it still is but under more sly movements that push for more rights for blacks only.
I am dearly sorry to disappoint but im not Jedao-christian if thats what you are implying?
And yes i understand that you as a non citizens get a pension when you pay money into a pension fund (that is   owned by thr government)
Its not tax, its a pension. Its still your money citizen or not.

In Africa no laws are needed, because you gotta be a crazy fucker to want to move from the first world to some shithole where you will be discriminated against and subject to government backed crime. (South africa is a nice example of that one)
And as for Asia, you ever heard how hard it is to become a Japanese citizen? Japan is SUPER homogenous and has low immigration, especially low 3rd world immigration. And wowee happy country, low crime rate, no religious terrorism (it sure as fuck aint part an parcel of living in a city Mr Khan.) And high standards of living. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 11:08:30
Mmm yes, I want the freedom asian nations have, or african nations. Nobody blinks an eye that Nigeria is 99% black? Or china 99% asian. Why should it be forced down my thoat that the UK need be "Diverse"?
Oh wait Nigeria is diverse! I forgot, silly me, diverse today just means more brown people!
Im the one arguing for quality here. Just tolerance is shoved down our throats too much because of silly white mans guilt.
@_date: 2018-09-24 10:32:02
Lmao, im in farages arse because I see that in every nation with "diversity" there is civil unrest?
A homogenous society is a happy society.
@_date: 2018-09-24 10:26:32
Diversity a strength? Jesus, where are you living? Toon-town?
On second thought, you sound like one of the brainwashed lefties from Birmingham.
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:42:45
Its not quite slavery as you would imagine it, maybe more like a form of indentured servitude.
@_date: 2018-09-24 10:16:32
I feel bad for you dude. R.I.P. your city
@_date: 2018-09-24 07:44:45
Yes, its a clear insult because everyone knows muslims can't take jokes about their faith.
And sure I might not know all muslims, but i can guarantee any muslim who would laugh at it is only a muslim in name, the way im a christian in name.
@_date: 2018-09-24 10:39:53
Did I say that one race is superior? Or that I belive in authoritarianism? Or that i'm a socialist?
"Reeeeee she thinks that multiculturalism is a failed experiment, must be a nazi"
Also I wouldn't try and paint me a nazi, they would want me dead just as much as would a good chunk of muslims ;3
