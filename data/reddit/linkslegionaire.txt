Yes it is. The whole point of the Coral meme is that Rick is telling Carl a terrible joke with a corny punchline and emphasizes his pronunciation of 'Carl' as 'Coral'. What OP posted wasn't funny either, rather him just being upset he bought high. Where's the joke?
By your logic, this would be a funny and correct meme: 
That's what we get without any 'rules'. Jokes have rules. Most follow a setup-&gt;punchline format. Memes (especially old ones like this) follow a specific format else it ceases to be the same meme.
I really can't believe I'm explaining how memes work in a crypto Reddit thread though. Hopefully 2018 gets better.

You don't pay people with PayPal. You pay people *through* PayPal. There's a big difference.

0/10 complete misuse of this meme.

That's so weird! I thought the same thing at the store the other day. The cashier said "$21.45 please." And I'm like 'woah, bitcoin can also be used as a currency!'. It was a wild day.

That doesn't mean a question shouldn't be asked.
The last coin is a long ways off, and it's pretty tough to say what our technology will look like then, so I'm not sure it's an answerable question.

Because PayPal isn't decentralized or private.
The architecture that exists that makes PayPal so simple and efficient has been refined over decades, of course crypto is going to take a little bit of time to catch up.

I can tell you, with 100% absolute certainty, that no one knows.

I'm sure there are some people like that. Likewise, I'm sure there are those that truly believe in the technology and will hodl indefinitely.
Generalizing is never accurate.

I'll give you 0.03 of my BTC for 0.05 of yours.

It's a plated iron coin. Worth about $1 USD.

I'm sure it will.

If you buy 1 Bitcoin at $6000 USD and the 'price' goes to $7000 USD, you'll still have 1 Bitcoin, yes.

Running joke. It literally means 'hold'.

BTC isn't an investment - it's all speculation.
Buy ASAP and hodl. If you're inclined you can wait for a slight dip but you're better off just buying at whatever price it's at.

Very true; if everyone starts using it, then everyone will be using it.

You need a specialized mining rig to mine Bitcoin. You're a few years late to mining on a CPU.
