Dude let’s surprise you that regulated body do not answer like this our Terms of Use, where you were informed that we may block any pending transfers until we are "satisfied with the information you have provided and determine in our sole discretion that it is sufficient": so if you still think that regulated payment institution answer like this? They put down your rose glasses .  Slovenian company got license in Luxembourg??? Why not to get license in Slovenia??

Nice from 2016 but they got approval to operate in EU yes but one little correction payment institutions must to provide his license number on the site plus in case of any problems you can always contact with regulator , but let’s put this a side I don’t want to waist your and my time maybe you try to defend Bitstamp that’s ok with me , but bitstamp don’t have any license! And all this good when you make deposit in FIAT currency when it’s only crypto to crypto, most of the licensed exchanges ask by regulators to remove anonymity currency and this is find .
