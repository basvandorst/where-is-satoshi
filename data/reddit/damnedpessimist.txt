yeah i unsub'd from r/btc last year.  too much delusion &amp; denial there.

Owning a "whole bitcoin" means nothing.  own as much or little as you feel comfortable with.  btc smallest amount is 0.00000001  which is called 1 satoshi.

What is this?
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:01:46
Lol, nice article.
@_date: 2018-05-14 04:28:40
Not btc specific, but in general i love coinomi.
@_date: 2018-05-14 04:09:54
not too late.  just buy.   mining is only profitable on a large scale and with cheap electricity.

No puzzles, they are just generating hashes based on the data and a nonce.  Hashes are generated very quickly.   The miner that finds the smallest hash first gets the prize.  The requirement for "smallest" depends on the current difficulty factor. If blocks are found faster than 10 mins, the difficulty goes up.  Otherwise down.

exchanges run their own wallets, in which they give you and all their clients wallet addresses.  if you send coins to an exchange, you are giving them to their wallet with the hope that they will keep it safe and send coins back to you when you request.

2010, but did not buy because i didn't understand it properly at the time.  bought in 2016.

You can't "hack" the blockchain.  What you can do is get someone to gain access to his computer, make a copy of his bitcoin wallet.dat file and restore his wallet elsewhere and transfer all his coins to your own wallet.  also, this would only be possible if was lazy abd choose not to encrypt his wallet.  
Another thing you can do is try to find out his login credentials to any crypto exchanges he uses and again transfer his coins to your own wallet.

Somebody explain this.  Sorry, i don't get it.

I have a bunch in my basement.  Yup, they are as loud as running a rack server.

'Deposit to withdraw' scams are rampant these days.  Also, what the heck is mcvalut?

as long as governments exist, cryptocurrencies won't take over because governments have no control over them.

I had a friend buy a contract.  Would have earned more by just buying and holding btc.

check your transaction id on a bitcoin block explorer.  if it's had 6 blocks mined since your transaction, it's confirmed.  If your app says it's not, your app is busted or not connecting properly.

Currently, for the normal person, buying into altcoins is only good for the purpose of selling back out into btc if/when the alt price rises, ie trading for profit.
@_date: 2018-10-09 14:46:37
in crypto, trading is 24/7.
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:44:31
So you're saying you made yet another interface to some block explorer.
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:15:02
Um, 99% of alt coins DO have their own blockchain.  And many use a different algo.
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:20:09
What about us that make money swing trading?  I can't trade every day if my coins aren't on the exchange.  (crosses fingers that binance won't get hacked)
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:00:11
Not the same. Bitcoin runs on a blockchain but so do a lot of things these days.
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:25:39
Not before still dropping some more.   The high levels won't be coming until late 2020 or 2021.  Sorry, you're screwed in the short term.
@_date: 2019-12-26 02:02:54
use coinomi

I tend to agree... $1500 will be the lowest, then slow growth upwards again for a year before taking off to the moon.
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:57:19
Based on my own technical analysis graphing.  I hope i'm wrong, it don't it want it dropping that low.
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:21:07
Mining on small scale won't make you money.  Even larger operations are having problems these days with trying to get actual profitability.
@_date: 2019-01-28 22:56:35
Answer to both is you can't.
@_date: 2019-01-28 22:54:42
Yes, but no matter what anybody says, it's NOT easy.  I know from experience.
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:47:51
lol, fuck apple.  I run a linux desktop and laptop.

I graduated university with a bachelors in computer science... and i ended up getting into web application developement, which you don't need a university degree for.  so try getting something better than a web dev job, or you'll feel like you wasted your education like me.
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:37:12
It's excellent, never had a problem.  It might be as fully featured as other multicoin wallets but it supports some smaller coins which I like.

If you need money now, pull out.  Just don't kick yourself when you see it keep rising.

Missing a 'we' in there.
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:38:02
But would it not be a better deal to just buy those coins directly on a market rather than paying for mining them?  
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:04:44
Somebody needs to keep mining otherwise you won't be able to send anything with a stalled blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-24 20:31:50
you don't know that the difficulty will get harder and your contract will get cancelled before you get to the breakeven point.   you will never get past breakeven to make any profit.
