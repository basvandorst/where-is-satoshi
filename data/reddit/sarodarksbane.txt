"We keep 99% of your funds and loan the other 1% out, so banking with us is free, but we don't pay interest on deposits."

Not true.  Every smart (and secure) company dealing in bitcoins for users keeps some coins in cold storage, and others in hot wallets.
What they show to you when you log in to their site is just an entry in a database somewhere that tells you how much you have in your account and can demand from them at any time.  Only when you actually withdraw it to a wallet will it hit the blockchain.
When you transfer coins from account to account within the site, they don't need to use the blockchain; they just edit entries in their regular database.

Because SegWit transactions are "anyone can spend" transactions. The only thing that can keep them safe from being claimed by just anyone is that a super-majority of SegWit-aware nodes and miners enforce validation by looking at the extended block.  
If you try to activate SegWit without a super-majority, the non-SegWit-aware nodes and miners will happily let anyone and everyone spend SegWit transactions, thus forking the chain.

Replay attacks can only cause coins on the alternate chain to be sent to the same recipient on that alternate chain.  If you only transact in BTC and ignore BTC2X entirely, you don't need to worry about replay attacks at all.

The PIN you enter is stored on the device itself.  Hardware hacks like the one discussed here could bypass that.
Using a passphrase, by contrast, is like adding an extra word to your seed that the Trezor doesn't store.  Even if they get the rest of the seed, they can't get to your funds unless they know your passphrase.

They can't force you. Just run the code you want to run.


You're the one treating Bitcoin as a company, with all this discussion about which opinion is the minority that must submit to the majority.  Bitcoin is about individuals; we can all run the code we want to run, and no one can tell us otherwise.  If you don't want 2X, just upgrade the Core client to 0.15.0 and you won't even have to worry about it.  Easy.

Bitcoin is not a democracy; everyone runs the code they want to run.  
Someone else running an incompatible version of the protocol is not a "corporate takeover"; you can just run the code you want to run.  
Bitcoin was intended to be the creation of a money secured by math, and not by the good intentions of people.  If Bitcoin isn't resilient to people running incompatible versions of the protocol, no amount of social pressure will keep it secure.

When the fork happens you'll have coins on both.  If the old chain dies, you've lost nothing, and if the old chain doesn't die, that means we've had a successful, peaceful split between two groups with different use cases, so that's good too.

@_date: 2017-08-21 02:02:10
I have; that's how I know it can't happen.  Replay attacks allow a malicious recipient to replay transactions from one chain to another chain, allowing them to receive funds on both (assuming the input was from a pre-fork address, and therefore exists on both chains).  
If you only use BTC, replay attacks cannot steal your BTC.  A malicious recipient might steal your equivalent 2X coins, but who cares?  2X coins are just funny-money anyway, right?
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:40:00

*"I was excited to see a scaling solution come out for Bitcoin, combining 2 megabyte hard fork with SegWit.

How so?  Merchants using them to cash out cryptos for USD won't even notice the difference, since they don't see the crypto side anyway.
If switching chains causes fees go down, BitPay might be able to offer merchants better terms, I guess, but that's hardly a negative.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:12:59
Coinbase and BitPay are the two primary Bitcoin payment processors for online merchants.  
Whereas Bitcoin Cash was mainly miner driven (and therefore doesn't have much merchant support), the support of major payment processors for a SegWit2x fork is kind of a big deal, since any merchants using their services will automatically and invisibly move with them when they switch chains.

But they think 1X sucks, so no big loss for them either, right? By definition, the only people who need to be cautious are people who want to keep and spend both coins. 
That's the paradox here: The only people who could realistically call 2X an "attack" on BTC are the people who want to spend 2X coins in the first place.  They want to eat their cake and have it too.

@_date: 2017-08-17 20:34:17
Can't be a store of value without value.  
Anyone can clone Bitcoin at any time (and they have).  Bitcoin's value comes from the ecosystem and network effect, of which merchant acceptance is a large part.  A coin without a practical use case is a not a store of value; it's a virtual tulip bulb.  
"Miners vs Merchants/Users" was an interesting debate from the prior deadlock, and one which resolved strongly in favor of merchants/users, I would say.  Security of the chain is important, of course, but securing a chain with no use cases is pointless.
I might be wrong, but the next deadlock is shaping up to be "Miners/Merchants/Users vs Fanatics". I think one of those sides is going to end up very disappointed.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:15:00


Just to clarify: Hardware wallets use the seed to (deterministically) generate public/private key pairs, which they can then use to find addresses they own on the blockchain.
A passphrase in Trezor is a mutation on the seed before it generates these public/private key pairs.  Therefore, your data is not "encrypted" with a passphrase in the same way you might encrypt a hard drive.  A passphrase is basically just another part of the seed (one that you have to give the Trezor every time it boots up).  
Without the passphrase, the rest of the seed is effectively useless, as it's incomplete.

Exchanges are who I worry least about.  They have the resources and technical know-how to split their coins into post-fork addresses appropriately.


You'll know exactly where replayed funds went: to the same recipient address as the first transaction, the private keys of which are identical to, and owned by, the same recipient.  
That's why you can safely split coins by sending them to yourself: even if someone maliciously replays the transaction on the other chain, you're the recipient anyway.

Fair point.  I'll revise to a "contract you don't agree to".

"Then move!  You implicitly agreed to pay the mafia when you started a business here!"


Actually, I don't enjoy most of them, and would rather they were funded through voluntary trade rather than theft.  I think police, roads, firefighters, schools, etc. can be done better and cheaper through voluntary trade rather than theft and government-granted monopolies, just like I think the quality of bread here is better than in the soviet system.

Is that why there is currently only one type of cell phone, sold by only one manufacturer, on one cellular network?  Or only one type of clothing to buy, sold by one clothing store, for one particular price? I could go on but I think you see my point.
People in Soviet bread lines probably said similar things. "But without the government, how will the bread get baked??? Baking bread requires logistics, planning, and supervision!  Only a central entity to do that!"
It's easy to see why they might think that.  Having known only the scarcity and poor-quality of centrally-planned bread, it would be very difficult to imagine that bread could come into existence any other way.  Of course, we know better, but then we turn around and do the same with roads, fire departments, etc.  Why?  
Because it's always been that way, so clearly it's the only way to do it. Clearly.

The theory is the the artificial increases in the money supply through credit expansion (money printing, fractional reserve banking, etc.) sends false signals to market and causes investors to dump money into investments that aren't actually supported by market fundamentals.  That is to say, it creates a bubble.
Traditionally, when the bubble pops, the Fed rushes to "fix" it by more credit expansion (i.e. re-inflating a new bubble to replace the old).  Then they can claim everything's cool . . . until the new bubble pops.
Mises here is saying that either you take the hit to the economy now by not inflating a new bubble to replace the old one (thereby letting the market clear), or you'll take a much bigger one in the end when the entire currency and economy collapses under it's own weight.

Either they are free and I don't have to pay, or I'm paying for them and they are not free.

The flaw I see in such arguments is that since corporations write our laws, those things are already in their hands, and probably not for our benefit.  They are just given the veneer of authority and respectability by virtue of being nominally "democratic".
* Fishing/hunting quotas are unnecessary on private property.  Only publicly held land is subject to the tragedy of the commons.
* The problems with our prison system are pretty much completely on the government side.  They are the ones throwing people in jail for victimless crimes, after all.  It's only after the government has created a market for injustice that the corporate vultures circle to get a piece of it.
* Roads are something the government absolutely does not need to be involved in, in any way.
* The FDA leadership is a revolving door with Big Pharma, who wield it like a club to bludgeon competitors both new and old.  And if by some sorcery you get people in it that aren't corrupt, their incentive structure is all screwed up: if they approve a drug that kills thousands, they get caught in a whirlwind of shit, but if they disapprove a drug that could have saved thousands . . . nobody even knows or could prove it anyway.
Environmental protection is one of the trickiest ones, but I find it helps to see it like child labor laws:  prosperity is the best way to drive it out.  Once a society becomes wealthy enough, they can start to work towards goals that would otherwise be impractical.   That's why we're focused on those things, for example, and China is not.  They'll get there eventually.

I probably disagree with those gentlemen about whether or not a crime has taken place. 
* If we share the same security/court provider, they can lodge a complaint in the fashion our contract specifies and we'll hash it out that way.
* If we share a different security/court providers, they can lodge the complaint with theirs, and our two companies will work it out according to the contracts between them (probably involving a third party arbiter).
*  Or they could start shooting, and my security providers and I will start shooting, and we can all end up dead.
I'm betting most people will go for the first option.  Note, however, that if they do go for the all-out shooting war option, it's unlikely there will be carpet bombing of urban centers and nuclear weapons.  Still beats the hell out of the state!
