companies exist that sell in real time for fiat than make a purchase of anything just like a credit card.   the buyer getting a fee for this incentivises him to shop places that directly accept crypto but he is not limited to purchase the same goods.   it just doesnt help anyone avoid the large fiat style fees to keep demanding the dollar for any good you trade
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:42:06
Did you include a fee when you sent it.  I don't mean to sound rude but most commonly transactions are lost when no fee was attached which could delay confirmations for days at times

likely the fed would make their own alt they can't have btc
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:33:36
is it legit?  now make an auction Site that accepts be and put there so I can get it.   I have literally no fiat.   literally.

most transactions less than a minute.   ptp transactions at least don't require x number of confirmation 
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:03:43
for me this is where alt currencies come in.   Ltc  aim was entry level computers have mining chances unlike gpu intense coins.   I see btc as large bills or gold...  not good to take to the bar.   carry less weight with silver and get the change faster.   use gold when buying a home silver for common goods

what I think of the troll box.   It's expected there...  what I hate is smothering a real conversation with memos and what r/Bitcoin has become

post this in places like r/Alaska or other places with severe cost per gig or bandwidth caps.     by data rates here its worth minimum of $2 per gig

to do this we should generate the private key based on the exact dollar a machine eats and destroys.   paper dollar goes in and 1 ubtc credited.   denomination  of bill counts.     the miners make sure each bill is not counterfeit by comparing to all other especially sequential destroyed bills

sign in first it doesn't show all offers until you log in.   there are lots of traders they don't care what area you are in.   just find one with cash deposit and good rate
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:50:24
i dont care how hard working and honest they are...  they are forcing their slaves into fiat.   what gives them the right to say we dont allow you to buy and sell what you want
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:32:20
all it means is the transaction can be done without proof of identity.   like buying doughnuts is anonymous compared to going to the DMV.    in order to transact these you don't have to prove anything or subscribe to or sign anything.   you don't  need anybody's permission to buy or sell.    trade should look like a doughnut shop.   not like the DMV.   
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:24:44
yes? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:43:27
obviously if everyone shouts the same trivial suit then not  conversation takes place.    but we don't need bans we need peer sorting.   up down vote isn't enough we need a left for lulz button as in a meme and right for a fight marking trolls.   now I can input up down for the conversation and filter centre left and right column at set thresholds of right or left votes

about 500 people including rothchilds and early miners already in the north,  got most of the klondike gold fields.   some people miss the gold rush.   once crypto is mainstream new adopters will seek a new fair chance alt though

if you read what I wrote.   where you live does not matter on localbitcoins.com  just submit offer to buy and wait or find an offer to sell that  accepts cash deposit at a bank that you have near you

silver was more common 1850 to 1879 it was easier for smaller operations to extract and use.   gold was still used but it's abundance was concentrated in the wealthy.   silver coinage act 1879 stopped treasury making silver coins decreasing it's demand and dropping it further.   china Germany and a number of other countries dropped silver hurting badly it's value  1870s concentrating buying power in the hands of gold users and the already wealthy.    lead to 1890 depression and a huge increase in gold mining ventures,  gold rush 1898 brought some liquidity to the market and McKinley puts the nail in the coffin of silver in 1900 no longer accepted by treasury to back bills,  
common folk who could mine or who's savings in silver demanded silver stay and rich demanded gold standard
I think the analogies are ok

awesome your bitcoin is worth a million fiat.   trade it in so i can buy your cheap coin and you hold fiat. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:12:39
this.   occasionally you have to set the date further back if it doesnt update it
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:03:10
yep.   this brings sovereignty into the conversation.   not a single soul is free if yiu are forced to use King georges money to trade and since he issues it he can choose what you can and can not purchase witbout his stamp of approval.    dont tell the sheep though.   they may never understand. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:47:01
except that lower income people can mine lite  just as silver was easier than gold more accessible.  lower income people will keep it alive even if it trades for far less than bitcoin...

are you saying you can spend from and re used posit into the paper wallet unlimited times?   what about spending partially,  what happens to the change? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:56:46
not if people want it to convert tto fiat.  but when it's simply more convenient than a bank to all the owners...  when people would rather not go to an atm ever again,  never give someone a percent of every hour I worked when they cash my check minus the fee or force minimums or force use of debit for a hidden price fee,  when we realise slavery can officially end in the west for no bonds were created from debt and no portion of my Labor is owed for the central service of providing paper receipts.   a bank will get not one more dime from adopters of this,  when the value is truly realised...  nobody will cash out

p2p torrent restriction is to prohibit audio and video piracy.   it is to enforce idea ownership laws.   bitcoin is not at all on legal shaky ground or a threat. of lawsuit..

reddit is run by a marketing firm.   its design just isnt intended to function as a real democratic or consensus base,  certainly its design could use a facelift as to how weinteract with the conversational.   always thought we could have left and right voting or spacial placement voting to get a clearer understanding. 
so i see x number of upvotes but each might have a different trojectory.   one persons upvote may be slightly nudged right by the community for being productive and left for being unproductive.   up and down then are like and dislike.   can view by top memes over on the left or top discussion on the right
