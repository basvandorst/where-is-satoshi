This is a pretty bad analysis, frankly, though I admire the effort. Power costs are something like $1-$3/bitcoin right now. It would make no sense for someone currently mining to stop other than some rare edge cases where they just don't want to deal with the noise in their room or something.

You're probably underestimating how quickly gold would be valued. It need not be edible, it just needs to be exchangeable for something edible. The first day? Probably not, but within less than a week you'd see metals trading for food. It's the safest/easiest true currency in an apocalypse.

Complete (or near complete) failure is the most likely end result. If it weren't, prices would be much higher.
Even if it had a 1 in 10 chance of gaining serious traction and reasonably wide acceptance it would probably be seriously undervalued at the current $100/btc.

These two statements don't quite add up. I'd be surprised to see litecoin do more than 2-4% of the volume of bitcoin. It also exposes a competing currency to their entire userbase, many of whom are very new to the bitcoin currency. I think in general clone currencies, as you mention, are not considered a remotely positive thing for bitcoin. It's clear mtgox intends to add it (not as clear when), but I don't think it's the no brainer some are making it out to be.
I don't think clones are as big of a threat as you. Currency has huge network effects. People hate eBay but no one could compete until Amazon. Facebook has been dominant for almost a decade now. Clone currencies don't worry me, vastly superior ones do though. We'll see if someone can build the vastly superior bitcoin and get traction for it.

I wasn't doubting the benefit to the buyer or seller. I see what you mean on batching transactions and eliminating overhead for WU.
I think the biggest hurdle in this system is the biggest hurdle in WU already, which is that it's considered pretty wildly unsafe for doing business with someone you don't know, especially someone overseas. If a merchant can develop a strong reputation that helps, but often it's cheaper to just pay the 3-4% to a payment processor and gain a consumer's trust that way.
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:15:43
This method of valuation is really poor. His estimate of CLV is really, really rough. I could pretty easily argue for a Mt. Gox account CLV anywhere from $50 to $1,000. A 40x spread that makes the analysis pretty worthless.
It would make a lot more sense to go by current revenues (not that hard to estimate) and then give valuations based on that figure, standard multipliers/discounts, and a few different growth forecasts for both BTC prices and volume.

I think everyone is aware that it's "amateur hour" (well, not everyone, there are a lot of stupid kis in here). Bootstrapping a currency into existence doesn't happen overnight.
Anyway, at this point, nothing can be done to prevent the currency from being volatile. It's value really is in huge flux. If it can get a strong foothold it could be worth 6 figures, if it can't it's eventually worth nothing. Those two respective chances are changing wildly by the day.

It's just crazy to me that you can't or won't recognize that you'll have more cancellations with bitcoin. Most people don't intend to be long-term porn subscribers. A lot of times they're just signing up for a free trial that starts changing them a week later. If I were signing up with a site like that with bitcoin I would make a new wallet address with as little as possible in it and sign up that way so that I'd never get billed again.
Bitcoin has lower fees and no charge-backs (a big plus) but if you lose even 5% of your re-bills because of it then it's very likely not worth it. I think they'd lose far more than that.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:41:33
This feature would need to become universal. It also has a ton of failure points (the wallet is empty, in cold storage, etc). It also makes it trivially easy for the user to cancel. This is great for the user, but maybe not so great for the vendor (from their perspective).
All that to say, what they benefit from accepting BTC does not make up for what they lose if they are running on an auto-bill model.

The biggest risk is always existential risk. The reason all of us here want them to do it is the same reason that it's risky for them, we want to help ease the adoption of Bitcoin.
Western Union could stay transitionally relevant as an exchange point, as you say, but an ATM seems to do that job better and surely far cheaper. Bitcoin could absolutely render WU irrelevant.
Having said that if it were to become clear that Bitoin were going to succeed with or without them then they should almost surely hop on board. They may want to anyway, as it seems only a matter of time until person-to-person transfers can happen instantly and internationally via PayPal-esque offerings from the major banks.

The only answer is that they (most likely) have more to gain by staying in business than by grabbing account balances.
I work for a completely different company in a different industry, but with pretty similar operating concepts. Our total user balances are less than we make in 6 months. I actually expect their figures to be extremely close to that as well. We wouldn't steal them either way of course, but even absent any morals we wouldn't steal balances unless it looked like we were headed out of business anyway.

The last time this happened there was a slow drip down from here. That may or may not happen again.
The mechanism there is that there are a lot of bubble riders who are still in. They're in because:
A) They've already lost a lot, they figure they may as well ride it out
or, almost the same..
B) They figure the price is pretty cheap now and there's a chance for another runner up.
What can happen is, unless there's large demand for these coins at this price from people who actually want to *own* the bitcoins, then it's going to be hard to get any momentum going up. Once the price has been stale for a day or two people start to decide the ride is over and sneak out the door, there's no big rush but the losses mount because each little drop in price causes a few more people to give up, and so on.

Last time there was a run-up and crash it settled in at about double the pre-run-up price. This round has been a lot larger, a lot more people found out, and a lot more legitimate uses are coming out of it. I'd be very surprised if it's much under $50 in a month. I still wouldn't rule out $400 either though.

Gold's peak was in the 80s, not 1900
I agree that gold and bitcoin have very little in common. One is a brand new cryptocurrency that will most likely fail (but could be worth 100x today's price if it doesn't). The other is a fairly stable store of value in use for thousands of years.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:51:43
This is a good counter to people a couple of weeks ago who said the price was only falling because of DDoS attacks. The *real* story was that the price was falling because of DDoS attacks *and* because people didn't trust that their bitcoins were fundamentally worth the current price.
Take away the second part and a DDoS doesn't do much.

This is a bit misleading, the trade floor also lags like this when there's a legitimate crash happening as well. No way to know which it is unless/until things stabilize.

In an airplane you encounter turbulence 100,000 times for every 1 crash.
On Mt. Gox you encounter a trading floor that looks like this maybe 10 times for every 1 crash.
The idea that the price always bounces back up after one of these is silly. Sometimes it doesn't. No real way to know which it is until after the fact. If you have more in than you can afford to lose it might be very smart to sell ASAP.

It really comes down to what fundamentals you're trading on.
Are you just playing the bid-ask spread? If so you're not hurting, and you're actually helping a little. If it's this you're likely not as profitable as you think as mathematically you'll always fill more trades on the "wrong" side than the right one.
Are you riding trends up and down? You're definitely hurting a little, and you're very possibly not as profitable as you think.
Are you trading based on the price getting out of line with the actual underlying value at the time? If so you're doing a great thing, and you'll be very profitable in the long run, but this assumes you know with some certainty the underlying value... which is one hell of an assumption.

Maybe I'm not creative enough but it's hard for me to think of something another currency could do to be easier to buy that couldn't be emulated by services surrounding bitcoin.

"Just call up..." is not part of easy. Some companies out there make you call to cancel specifically because so many people are prone to putting it off.
You come off here like you're just trying to defend bitcoin, rather than trying to take an honest survey of the situation.

No, because people were posting it non-stop in May of 2011 during the run up, then in June of 2011 during the crash, then after as it stayed stale at the new low price, then again as it ran up last month and now as it crashes. Basically anything that has run ups and blow offs you can say fits this chart, yet they hardly ever actually follow this exact simple, one-off bubble and crash pattern.


You've never set foot in an investment office, and anyone who has can tell that.

A subscription-based model is far more lucrative for most of these sites. Once subscribed a consumer must make the conscious decision to *stop* buying the product as opposed to continuously making the conscious decision *to* buy the product. It's night and day, and if bitcoin can't offer a subscription-style payment then subscription-based porn sites will not use them.

Most of the haters were making fun of people buying at $17 too since it was such a huge spike up from $12, so you're being a bit misleading when you act like they "called it"
I hope that you won't take what's just happened as a sign that "the graph" is always accurate. The reality is that no one knows for sure where the price is headed at any given moment, if they did they'd put their money where the mouth is and you'd see the price move accordingly.
I don't think the bubble pop is much of a shock to most of us. The important question was *when*. Personally I thought it would be around $100 (I sold out over half my coins at $90), then I was sure it would be at $200. It turns out even the post-pop price is going to be about as high as the number I thought wasn't sustainable even a few weeks ago. So to a large extent the optimists "won", these are still up 500% over 2 months ago.

But the ddos doesn't explain why the nearest buy and sell orders to each other would be $20 apart.

Not really. The important things essentially *have* to happen, so the two sides would just have to figure out a way to make it work.

A lot of folks bought in because they saw the price going up and wanted to ride the wave, rather than on the underlying fundamentals of the currency.
Many (not all) of those people were shaken out when the price changed directions. It doesn't matter what triggered it, it matters that people were willing to sell. At this point I'd prefer to see the rest of them go (as they will if the price stays stale for another day or two) so that we can return to a stable growth and give the surrounding services to bitcoin a chance to catch up.

This would be what, 70% off its high? How many times in modern history has gold gone down 70% from a peak? I'm not sure, but I would guess once or never.

Lol, no. Jesus Christ, this sub-reddit sometimes...

If you put in a market order when this started then you're likely in great shape relative to the current market price. What an odd post.

Past results don't necessarily correlate to future events, but so far 100% of similar run-ups in BTC price have ended with massive crashes.

Except when the recovery doesn't come. Or did you forget that one?

Holy shit. I hope that reporter realizes he/she has $500!

People were also saying it was too expensive in 2011... and then it lost 90% of its value. I get the sense you missed that ride, many of us didn't.
