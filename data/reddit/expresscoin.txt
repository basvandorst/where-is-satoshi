I'm glad you got your Bitcoin - We work with the folks at zenbox to supply them with Bitcoin.  If there are more ATM operators out there, we would love to help.  Send us an email: support

Expresscoin can do this.  verify on expresscoin.com and send a wire.  Can be done the same day, usually within a few hours.

You can buy from us.  If you use a bank wire, we can typically get it to you the same day if you make your bank wiring cutoff time.  
If you are buying less than $1000, all we need to verify you is your email and mobile phone.  Check us out! [

This isn't the comparison chart (we are also working on it) but a list of Bitcoin wallets.  Look for ones with the IOS icon.

Hi! I'm from  We do things quite a bit differently than Coinbase.
We don't require you to link a bank account. Verification is instant for basic level orders (under $1000), and for advanced level orders (up to $3000 per order) verification is same-day. We send your coins out as soon as payment is received on our end. Depending on your desired payment method, that could mean in as little as 15 minutes.
We accept Cash deposits, Bank wires, Money orders, &amp; Checks.
We’re also testing out PayPal, by request.
We’re based in Santa Monica, California (come visit us!) and are AML / KYC compliant and registered with FINCEN.
Would love to have you as a customer. You can email me personally at jeff if you have any comments or questions.
@_date: 2014-08-04 03:30:33
Dotcom indeed! 
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:43:42
We're with you! You should try our site out. We only send coins to your personal wallet, so you'll never have to experience a coin hostage again!

Hey Johnny,
It's probably been received at the post office but not yet processed internally.   There can be a small delay based on the volume for the day.  If you email us directly with your confirmation code we can make sure to track it down asap.

It was cool to see international visitors use the machine- they didn't need to take their home currency to an exchange- they just brought their Bitcoins directly to the machine and exchanged instantly for cash to gamble. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 18:44:28
You can buy from us at [expresscoin]( without bank information via a money order or cash deposit from a local credit union that supports Shared Branching.  Just note, our AML/KYC requirement still need your verification with a full name, email, and mobile confirmation (Up to $1000/order).

You make great points.  We are dealing with a few issues that I need to work out.  Banking is part of it, but it only causes us a few hours of delay certainly not two full days or even one.   This is a problem with the way we are processing cash orders.  It is dumb mistake but it's on me.  I am working to resolve this asap.

Hey Bitloopy, 
We tried to reach out to you and make it right within moments of your initial email request.  We even refunded the difference before you replied to our email as a gesture of good faith.   We are sorry for the confusion, exchange rate variances cause issues.
For the record, we never promise to deliver an exact amount of bitcoin prior to receiving payment.  BTC price volatility makes it too difficult for us to lock prices. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 01:40:07
It seems to come in cycles, but our alt coin prices aren't incredible competitive so I think most people use us to buy BTC then send their btc to an exchange such as cryptsy. 
That's cool by us.

help tip other people....

Thanks!  We are still online but its just running a little slow,  send us an email sometime and tell us what we can do better!

Yeah, everyone should be focusing on pushing btc forward, not making a few coins out of greed.

We just got back from servicing the machine. Machine was out of Bitcoin within 24 hours. Tons of demand.

We support smart regulation.   Every bitcoin company has an obligation to protect the consumers, regulation is a way of managing that expectation and helping to ensure good actors.
However, I think we can all agree that over regulation is as awful as bad regulation.
$1 thanks for the link!

Interesting question!  Hmm.
A long time ago I was a manager for a small chain of electronics retailer stores and one day a friendly customer walked in and started talking about this new crazy thing called bitcoin and how it was anonymous and cheap (one of those statements are more accurate than the other).
That was June 2010,  and I never looked back.   Except for the the crash that happened a few days later... and then again when it crash from 265 to 100, and then maybe when it crashed from 1200 to 500.  But I mean... those don't really count right?
How do I recommend people get started?  I always recommend getting started with 1) a friend, or 2) with a company like coinbase.   When you feel more comfortable, come to Expresscoin and we can get you sorted on the next leg of the bitcoin journey.

Cloudflare.   but we've been using it since way back when MtGox used to get DDoSed to induce panic sells.
@_date: 2015-05-02 04:13:52
Cloudflare FTW!

I'm sure they are, but its cool, I've also seen a few people get multiple tips... I mean whatever, its Friday night and I'm chillin'.
$1 @_date: 2015-05-02 18:47:54
That's a fair point, I'll remember that next time. 
$1 @_date: 2015-05-02 06:13:23
+1 to you too!

I kind of feel like paying that off one tip at a time would be okay...  or at least I wouldn't be as mad about it.

As long as you have people who are willing to be robbed, there will always be robbers.   But hopefully its fewer and fewer people.
$1 @_date: 2015-05-02 01:18:00
thanks!  We saw that article last month but we wanted to do something different.
Keep up the good work!  $1 @_date: 2015-05-02 04:08:32
I think its a small group. I don't think they are assholes, just misguided. 
$1 @_date: 2015-05-02 05:06:47
My site seems to be fine. But thanks for your thoughts.
$1 @_date: 2015-05-02 02:43:36
Thanks!  
They are still DDosing I think but I haven't looked in a bit. 
$1 @_date: 2015-05-02 03:59:13
$1 exactly!  it would just make us an easy target... I think?
@_date: 2015-05-02 01:53:24
They will jack up the rates but they will only waste money.

other way around,  the company can't use it unless the employee (inventor) gives them permission. 
It's like the nuclear football, the military might launch the missile but they have to get the go-ahead code from the president first. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 06:35:57
Thanks for the kind words!
$1 @_date: 2015-05-02 02:32:38
as far as I can tell, one of our websites was down for about 30 minutes and its been ~3 hours....  so we'll see how long they keep it up for. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 04:34:56
Just 2 BTC... I wonder how much I've tipped tonight.
$1 @_date: 2015-05-02 00:14:31
we have cloudflare, it seems to be doing the trick but let me know if you see something different.

I'm king of jealous you got to the hand gesture..
Thanks for the support!

$1 Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2015-05-02 04:00:36
$1 Thanks!  We're trying!
@_date: 2015-05-02 00:25:01
I saw that a while ago and I haven't had time to really research it so I don't want to tip into it just yet.
but if you do, that's up to you.

A lot of bitcoin companies work with regulators to help craft smart regulation.  
$1 @_date: 2015-07-21 01:14:32
You can come talk to us.  That is perfectly in line with our main customer group.   
Verification takes less than a day and we can get you amounts up to 10k/day 30k a month pretty easily. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 02:38:08
send us a message, I am sure we can help you out.
@_date: 2015-09-16 17:48:53
Checking in, sending a money order is a pretty straight forward process and we don't have any unanswered support tickets right now.   If you PM me your details I can get to the bottom of it.   
If we've cancelled your order it could be for several reasons, either way we return funds from unfilled orders directly to the sender.
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:26:53
We hate to see you go but we can recommend a few of our friends on localbitcoins who we trust and have worked with for a long time, just shoot a support ticket in and I'll give you a few names.
@_date: 2015-09-17 04:11:21
No harm, no foul.  Glad we were able to work it out! 
@_date: 2015-09-16 17:51:03
This is important to remember for anyone using the USPS money order system.  If you ever send a money order to anyone and it gets lost or you don't get the product, you have a very good means to get the funds back.  It's one of the reasons we use it instead of having people send cash.
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:15:53


well said, we agree 100%.
