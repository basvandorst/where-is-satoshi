Electrum generated seeds are not BIP39 compatible. I was unable to restore Electrum generated seeds to Trezor and I assume this is the same for Ledger since they both use BIP39. On Trezor entering the Electrum seed to the restore doesn't even result in a valid wallet

Was the wallet generated with Electrum? Electrum wallets aren't BIP39 compatible so if it was you'd have to try recovering back to Electrum

The post like this  was a social engineering attack. If you set up the seed yourself, your Ledger is safe

If you don't want to go quite as far as Daheavyb ;-) you can prevent your words being lost to fire and water damage by using this
