Is Peter Schiff at all related to the Jewish-American banker Jacob Schiff?
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:37:29
Meanwhile Schiff is secretly stacking satoshis!

Bitcoin could just add a privacy feature

Moron! I bet you eat GMOs and drink fluoride too! GTFO, zombie beta snowflake.

Yes. You should sell all of your BTC and invest in overvalued stocks! ����
@_date: 2019-11-02 18:49:56
Why the hell would you store crypto on a mobile wallet? Beyond stupid!
@_date: 2019-11-12 13:19:54
SMH! Central bankers are not incompetent. They know exactly what the fuck they’re doing.
@_date: 2019-08-29 01:08:27
Hell no

Tell them that Bitcoin adds a 0 every two years.
2009: $0
2011: $10
2013: $100
2015: $1,000
2017: $10,000
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:34:54
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:16:17
Of course it’s 3.3.

It’s a decentralized exchange.

Why not wait a few years and sell at $250k?
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:29:57
Tether just minted 100million new tether out of thin air before the pump. Don’t ignore this.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:45:52
Agreed and most will be underemployed making very little money
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:21:42
People said the same about BTC hitting $50, then $100, then $500, then $1000, then $5000, then $10,000, then $20,000, then....
Be patient.
@_date: 2019-12-10 03:10:54
Don’t you just love buying Bitcoin with money printed out of thin air?!
@_date: 2019-12-26 17:24:56
Don’t be fooled. A lot of those crypto youtubers deleted and/or set their videos to private. Majority of them shill shit coins anyway. GTFO
@_date: 2019-12-17 23:29:22
Nothing new here. It hit a low of 3200 last Christmas. Just keep stacking SATS because when BTC hits 500k, you’ll be kicking yourself for not buying now or even when it was at 13k in the summer.
@_date: 2019-12-23 17:24:43
Precious metals and Bitcoin.

My TV tells me China and Russia are the boogeyman. I believe them because my TV would never lie or program my brain.

But wouldn’t your real IP be leaked the moment the connection drops?
@_date: 2019-12-27 19:16:01
Fuck the Rothschilds!
@_date: 2019-12-13 01:53:36
It could spike literally at any second. All it takes is a push of a button.
@_date: 2019-12-18 18:36:50
@_date: 2019-12-11 01:49:21
They want your email address.

@_date: 2019-12-13 01:11:45
What if the Tor connection drops for some reason?
@_date: 2019-12-26 18:16:04
Fuck them. They all shill shitcoins then dump their bags on noobs
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:31:26
The time to buy BTC was yesterday. Buy now because it’s not going any lower.
@_date: 2019-12-10 03:09:11
Don’t tell anyone you own Bitcoin.

Possibly because George Soros and the Rockefellers are getting in? 
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:24:49
Wait until it goes up past 40k. All those weak hands that sold off. ����������
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:19:21
15k? Nah bro, it’s going to 40k, then 60k, then 100k

You have to pay taxes on every trade you make. This is why you just HODL
