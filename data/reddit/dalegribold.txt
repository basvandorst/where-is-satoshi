bummer - lots of other people in my boat there with the same frustration.

Also a heads up - the business in question is still listed on coinmap, even though their website is listed as closed.  Not sure if you guys update that, or the business in question.

I get that its a exponentially low possibility; but what would happen if two wallets had the same address (via random or malicious intent)?  Do wallet apps do some sort of check before giving out these addresses?

You switch from smiling to confused face every ~3 seconds.  I still like the content though!  Bitcoin reporting from the back of a moving car - now that's journalism! :)

Just curious - has anyone ever gone through/debunked the likely technical approaches that a govt/organization would ATTEMPT to stop bitcoin?  Blocking TCP port 8333 at key infrastructure points?  There are obviously workarounds to this "block" (VPN/tunneling/etc) but how would such a thing impact people with wallets on their smartphone that don't necessarily understand the underlying protocol?  I've seen some discussions on bitcointalk but nothing that really answers it yet.

Did you pay with BTC?  If so, how was that experience? Did you run a tab on a CC and just close out with BTC?  How was tipping handled?  If not, sorry for the barrage of questions - I'm always interested in learning about BTC deployments in the real world! :)

Very cool project.  
What are the legal catches with skyhook?  I read their legal form for US operators to fill out before purchasing.  Just seems too easy, considering that all of the other US based ATMs need multiple forms of identification. 
edit: just found the skyhook team AMA...ill read through that first..sorry :)

I'm sure you've been asked before - do you have that username memorized?

i dont even know, but have an upvote for sharing a very interesting watch!
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:53:44
good read - thank you!
@_date: 2014-08-27 03:51:57
thanks - after reading a bit more about how the blockchain uses hashes of public keys, this makes it clearer to me.
if curious:

I tried it out and it went very smoothly  - just like the skyhook videos demonstrate.  Fees were somewhere between 5-7% assuming it was built into the price as my phone said $507ish and they wanted $530ish.  Doesn't matter, would pay that all day vs coinbase.  Not that I hate coinbase - but I think this type of ATM setup is more aligned with bitcoin.

How can we get funds out if we saw this message late?  Regret to see the site go away, but I hadn't looked at bitbook until recently for NBA playoffs only to find out it was taken down.

thanks - this is my new background image! (admittedly low resolution for that but i dont care! :) )

This is great!  I must say though, that if newegg would outright stop doing rebates in order to be competitive, they would get so much more of my business (tangental, but relevant, sorry).  I know a lot of times it is through the manufacturer; but as a consumer, when I see a "rebate offer" I immediately add that back to the retail price.
@_date: 2014-08-27 03:13:31
Sorry; $530 was a lazy guess on my part, I actually snapped a pic of the ATM before using it and after looking at the pic, the ATM displayed $533.25 (sorry I don't remember exactly what my phone, which uses the android simple bitcoin ticker widget pointed at coinbase, was quoting at the time) - based on all of that I think 5% is about where it is.  Anywho, 10/10 will use again!
@_date: 2014-11-21 17:43:28
This is an interesting development.  I remember from the "rise and rise of bitcoin" documentary them specifically calling out anonymous donations as one of bitcoin's benefits (like how wikileaks got donations).
@_date: 2014-09-05 23:30:29
Thanks for reply...will definitely try again!

Extra big ass fries!
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:03:57
right... I think one of the fundamental things that makes bitcoin robust/resilient/reliable/secure is that average joe can run a full node.  If the blockchain storage (and network throughput, and processing) could rotate across a pool of "partial nodes" then that would give it the benefits of a distributed infrastructure while remaining de-centralized.  I am not a strong coder, but if I were, this is what I would be focusing on.  Just running my full node to continue supporting for now. :)
@_date: 2014-10-15 06:26:34
Sorry to read through that!  Did you look at project skyhook at all?  Doing only Fiat -&gt; btc seems a lot simpler/cheaper from an operator standpoint (and consumer for that matter!).
@_date: 2014-10-16 00:49:47
It doesn't - I've used em 3 times now.  Just scan QR code, deposit cash, wait for the btc to arrive.  Very slick!
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:22:19
While bandwidth is costly, I think storage becomes a bigger issue as scale increases.  
Think about it this way - should every full node need to have a local record of every micropayment every user has ever made, since the genesis block?  That isn't meant to be rhetorical question either - this is how bitcoin is working today.  I am just posing the question from a standpoint of: do we need transactions for vending machines/toll tags/monthly bill payments to have a place on the blockchain?  Multiply all that times 7 billion people and the storage requirement gets exponentially larger.
@_date: 2014-09-15 02:19:39
Thanks for the reply!  Hopefully with time this sort of payment process will get streamlined as well as 'sexier' to the masses.

I don't know why you're getting downvotes...haters gonna hate.
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:06:40
Not true for every us based atm.  There are many skyhooks deployed where it is simply cash in btc out.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:10:05
Not necessarily.   Smaller blocks means the miners will prioritize processing transactions with higher transaction fees associated.   Spam transactions won’t get they without having to pay fees.
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:18:22
Agreed!  To reinforce point  it just doesn't make sense for every full node to need to know about every cup of coffee anybody buys, anywhere, using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:26:01
Didn’t he just talk at a conference in the last month or so?   Surprised to see them folding...
