If you have a credit card and don't mind giving a few personal informations to get verified, you should try out circle.com. If you only have a bank account, there is coinbase.com. It take a few days to finish a purchase though. (via SEPA)  
Also, which cafe is it? :D
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:05:57

You could try bitcoin.de, although you can't pay via SOFORT, the price is fixed at the moment of the purchase. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:03:25

@_date: 2015-05-18 09:25:10
I'd say it is because of a lack of advertising / awareness. Personally, I've tried it out and it has everything a good wallet needs: HDM, cold storage option if you have a spare smartphone, private key creator with a random generator, etc..  
It really deserves more advertising!
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:04:52
Although there is a $100 weekly limit, Circle.com offers a fast and reliable service to buy bitcoins with a credit card.  
I think if you level up your verification you could buy even more.  
You will probably have to send them a copy of your ID, but then again it's a reliable service ;) 
@_date: 2015-05-17 17:49:13

Airbitz seems not bad, but isn't it an "online" wallet?  
That's why I'd use Mycelium, whose security measures are great!  
I feel like Airbitz lacks at advanced options.. Is there only 1 address for the wallet? I hoped you could have different ones and change them at will. Haven't figured out how to do it in Mycelium though.

Dude you should totally buy bitcoins with bitcoin.

Rejoice, it's still sub 200*€*
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:53:33
Thanks for the advice, I finally found it.  
I was interested in using Coinbase as a wallet since it's easier to buy from them, but since you mention it, I will probably send them to another one.  
I've also installed Aitbitz, it's nice to find some merchants who accept Bitcoins near you, but to be honest I prefer Mycelium haha.  
Thanks again! :-)

Sell them through a marketplace, it's way more secure. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:05:02
Even though it's called bitcoin.de, they accept customers from all over Europe, as all the payments are made via SEPA. Also, it's an exchange so the fees are ok.
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:09:49
Bitcoin.de should be scammer-free, because they hold your coins until you get so sell them.

So far I've been using bitcoin.de and coinbase. The first one is good if you're in the EU, otherwise you could try Coinbase.  
It seems possible to buy for the actual price via Coinbase and they'll charge your bank account / credit card. They'll get their fiat later, but your bitcoins are safe.

I currently also have a Ledger and wanted to "upgrade" to a Trezor.  
Because Ledger is good, however you need a non-compromized PC when creating the wallet.  
Honestly, I feel like 0.3 BTC are well worth it if you want to secure any amount of coins.  
Just my thoughts : ) 
@_date: 2015-07-05 11:51:07

If your income is decent enough, you can put around 10% of it into Bitcoin. At least this is how I do it.  
But make sure to educate yourself on secure Bitcoin storage and stuff like that.. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 09:35:26
Did your neighbor try to cash out?  
On a more serious note, try to sell smaller amounts on online exchanges, maybe buy Amazon gift cards with Bitcoin if you use Amazon a lot, or sell some Bitcoin for cash etc...  
The best is to diversify it.

@_date: 2015-07-06 12:02:13
If you give someone your public address, i.e. for receiving a payment or when you send him some bitcoin, he can track this address and see it's balance.  
If you reuse this address a lot, he would be able to see every transaction coming and going to this address.  
That's why not reusing the same address again is a very important aspect of privacy! 
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:51:19
The transaction may still be unconfirmed?  
In my understanding, if it doesn't get confirmed after a while you can try to double spend it from your bitcoin core wallet.

It's about sending a message
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:13:43
I don't know if it works but you could connect your credit card to your Circle account and sell Bitcoin there, then send them to your CC. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 13:01:01
I haven't had too much experience with Circle yet, but I believe Coinbase offers more in terms of storage option: wallet, vault, etc..  
I'd recommend the Vault, because you can let them manage the private keys for you.  
They also have the option of a wait period before you can withdraw from the vault (should you ever get hacked)
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:18:10
If you want to change to a wallet which doesn't store all the blockchain on your computer, I'd recommend using a lightweight client such as Electrum.  
I'm not sure whether you can import the wallet.dat file, however you should be able to 'import' the private keys?
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:38:35
Americanpegasus at it again whoop 
@_date: 2015-07-03 19:06:34
Bither has some great features such as HDM and a clean interface with the latest prices of multiple exchanges, somehow is really underrated!
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:29:15
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:39:31
Circle or Coinbase, and the latter also has an option to store your Bitcoins with a multisig vault.  
See here 
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:21:33
You just watch and wait something to happen...

@_date: 2015-07-07 13:53:38
tfw us european can't use gyft at all :(
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:43:06
Since 2012, congrats! Do many people come and pay with Bitcoin?  
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:03:11
Is there also a public address on the empty coins or how can I load them?  
Edit:  


  
Nvm 
@_date: 2015-07-06 12:03:46
Eh.. I like bitcoin.org better
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:52:40
Can you confirm that there are no fees when buying from Tradegate? 
@_date: 2015-07-06 10:19:39
If feels like we're already beyond this phase.. look at NYSE and nasdaq. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:06:56
@_date: 2015-04-27 06:43:53
Would do it if you cover the travel costs
@_date: 2015-04-21 19:21:25
Coinbase.com also has an affiliate program. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:02:46
not with that attitude
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:41:59
How much you wanna buy? You may want to check on the big exchanges too 
@_date: 2015-04-16 11:21:40
Well you can visit  and print a paper wallet. They have a few attractive and interesting designs, I would recommend this option.
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:34:16
Oh! Good to know this! 
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:37:15
Aren't you guys happy whenever the price falls so you can buy more bitcoins with your fiat? 
@_date: 2015-04-29 22:11:29
192537 I hope I'm not too late!  
I will try it out and give feedback, the website looks good! 
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:35:11
I hope all this gold has been purchased with bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:51:20
The Coinbase exchange lets you sell / buy directly from someone, while if you buy from Coinbase, it's from the company. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:34:21
If you're in the EU, you could try Bitcoin.de. It works with SEPA-transfers. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 21:28:11
Oh. I see the point.  
Well, I wouldn't use Coinbase as a wallet for those reasons, they also check where the btc are coming from / sent to.  
Coinbase should be used for buying and selling purpose only. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:52:47
Oops. You're right. Thats odd. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:04:58
How exactly will this work? Looks like an awesome idea!
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:25:26
Which state is this in?
@_date: 2015-04-06 22:47:40
Yes please!
@_date: 2015-04-15 21:02:50
You can send it to the address directly in changetip. I think the function is called withdraw? There must have been a lot on that wallet, since you're feeling generous!
@_date: 2015-04-19 11:05:48
Sure, Trezor is much safer but also more expensive. It all comes down to how much you are ready to pay for a secure way to store your bitcoins.  
If you're looking for something in between there also is the Mycelium Entropy device. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 20:54:21
When buying online through websites, most of them (payment processor) lock the price for ~10 mins. Within this time frame, the exchange rate btc / usd is fixed.
@_date: 2015-04-16 09:15:45
Finally, wire transfers and exchanging currencies gets better! 100 bits
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:59:22
You also can make your own paper wallets at 
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:00:36
Yes, seems like they haven't pushed the update to the Google Store yet. So they probably only advertised for the iPhone App. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 05:06:42
Thanks for this great start into the week :-)
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:49:45
It looks like you can buy Itunes Code gift cards via Gyft:   
You can pay in bitcoin. (I think you have to be in the US.) 
@_date: 2015-04-16 12:36:10
Wow! Danke für die Torte. I'll definitely buy myself a slice later! 
@_date: 2015-04-03 08:19:29
For how long?
@_date: 2015-04-26 21:20:28
I hope I'm not too late! 
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:18:06
Can you elaborate? 
@_date: 2015-04-17 18:09:44
In order to anticipate this for the next time, my tip would be to register on a few exchanges, where you would be able to buy a lot simulaneously. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:35:29
Hey just wondering in which country it works? 
@_date: 2015-04-15 21:14:48
o.O that's impressive! 
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:42:45
It looks like a great idea, an app would be really awesome!  
I'll try it in my location (we have € here not $), I hope that it will work! Fingers crossed! 
@_date: 2015-04-17 20:55:32
What did exactly happen? 
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:30:06
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:06:26
well, a lot
@_date: 2015-04-16 10:20:57
Buy with Bitstamp or Kraken, sell per Coinbase exchange?
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:31:39
100€ I think?
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:56:57
It's not always easy when it comes to small amounts :/ 
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:00:10
Thanks for some bits to pass on!
@_date: 2015-09-25 09:13:54
Keep buying
@_date: 2015-04-16 12:35:02
Oh, I see. There are some basic informations printed on the wallet, how to withdraw the btc, but I'd recommend him / her to download either Breadwallet / Mycelium depending on his smartphone.  
Also, I'd tip a significant amount to get him / her interested. And he / she could maybe even buy something with those bits and discover the simplicity of bitcoin payments.  
For US-residents, gyft.com is really easy to use whenever it comes to btc payments.
@_date: 2015-04-26 21:38:30
Go to sleep :) 
@_date: 2015-04-19 21:17:25


few extra bucks
  
I think you're alright.
@_date: 2015-04-16 11:09:19
Probably changetip!
@_date: 2015-04-16 10:01:09
You can buy Amazon.de gift cards at egifter.com. Simply enter the amount of € you want to buy on the gift card and pay in bitcoin. I've used it and it's really handy.
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:45:34
Not sure if April fools or not!
@_date: 2015-04-02 00:32:52
This is huge! 
@_date: 2015-04-17 20:57:43
Can be dangerous though: you know exactly how much money someone carries and where they are, has the potential to attract thieves. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:05:15
[Google Store Link](  
It's a wallet app for Android / Apple devices. It seems like since their latest iOs update, you can create your own private keys by rolling a dice (in-app)  
I've been using Bither for cold storage purposes, it's really handy!
@_date: 2015-04-15 21:31:14
The closest is circle.com. you can buy bitcoins with your credit card. However, if you want to send them to another wallet than your online wallet, you have to do this manually.
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:55:59
Well it should work with the following method: buy Amazon gift cards with bitcoin, then buy iTunes cards from Amazon! 
@_date: 2015-04-19 08:59:33
A lot of online betting sites which use btc don't require any personal informations, but I don't know how it's regulated in the US.  
Would using a VPN solve any problem? 
@_date: 2015-04-19 09:01:37
You have the possibility to pay via Amazon on Humble Budle.  
I'd follow steps 1 &amp; 2 stated above and you're able to buy anything from Humble Bundle! 
@_date: 2015-04-21 19:18:24
Already Tuesday again!?
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:07:02
Too bad that you can't pay with bitcoin .. :/
@_date: 2015-04-15 20:41:09
Where can I want a cash refund? 
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:18:01
yippieh! 
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:40:09
me too, thanks
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:19:21
Coinbase exchange did
@_date: 2016-10-29 21:37:21
Great news!!
@_date: 2015-11-04 09:44:54
This. Fidor also offers a free Maestro + Mastercard, so no problems with using it in Germany.
@_date: 2015-03-01 12:09:04


Thanks! I've set up a node and it's running smoothly. Can't wait for the website launch!!
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:31:36
flawless logic
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:21:53
If you have a credit card, I'd suggest Circle.com. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 23:54:12
Please make SEPA-Lastschrift happen! 
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:30:08
Just wait 'til the chinese traders wake up :)
@_date: 2015-03-03 11:57:53
Will you guys give any infos about the resellers, or are they well-known?
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:30:57
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:48:11
If I wanted to buy one now, are there any updates on whether a new batch will be ordered or not? Should I try to get one from the resellers? 
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:19:50
Don't jinx it! 
@_date: 2015-03-28 22:56:52
Of the private key?
@_date: 2015-03-28 21:37:31
If I buy from an EU-retailer inside Europe, will it get opened too? 
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:58:16
Hodl time
@_date: 2015-03-17 06:30:10
I'd really want to have one of these because I've missed out on the initial batch!
@_date: 2015-03-01 15:36:45
Well with Mycelium, you can already run it offline, backup your wallet, and so on. Sure, you'll never see your balance but that's not the purpose of having a cold wallet ?
@_date: 2015-03-01 18:43:03
True that
@_date: 2015-03-27 08:16:00
How can we buy those shares? 
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:27:47
Can we have the same globe where we can vizualize all blockchain transactions? 
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:11:28
Awesome! This is really nice to show friends &amp; family how easy it works!
@_date: 2015-03-19 18:16:10
Too bad it's only for Amazon US...
@_date: 2015-03-05 09:31:55
Bither is doing that too, aren't they chinese?
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:39:15
go go go!
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:22:42
@_date: 2015-03-03 13:32:22
Can't wait for it! 
@_date: 2015-03-01 15:04:27
Great! Thanks for the link, I'll look into Bither for sure.

The fact that the comic is already a year old makes it more hilarious

@_date: 2015-03-24 16:39:45
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:54:31
But withdrawals are only possible in BTC?
@_date: 2015-03-07 21:31:14
Does it still rain??
@_date: 2015-02-20 08:13:14
Caution! Deep web isn't the dark web!
@_date: 2015-02-07 15:47:48
A paper wallet would basically do the same regarding storage?
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:45:54
You make it rain ;)
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:11:27
Now kiss!
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:26:46
Feedback is welcome and can be given here: 
@_date: 2015-02-26 22:56:56
On long-haul flights yes, but it often does costs extra.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:45:07
Why would BTC drop though if after the fork a lot of people sold their BCC to buy BTC, more demand right?
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:40:33
The Coinbase Exchange if you're in the US (no fees at the moment) 
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:59:28
Is buying an old used iphone a viable option? On which ones can you run it?
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:48:55
Right! So handy!

Using Bitcoin for onboard-shopping - I would love to see that!

To the moon!

I believe it's still under progress.
@_date: 2015-02-21 00:26:57
I think it was referring to the fake ID but then again why an ID for weed?!
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:40:10
Does the same apply for fiat / banks? I mean if you don't hold the cash in your hands, it belongs to a financial institution?
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:44:20
[Joke as pic]( 
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:49:04
It's easier to show them how it works, rather than trying to explaining it. Eventually, those who are genuinly interested will ask more questions. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:29:41
It's really cool, but where can I get wool / a bed? 
@_date: 2015-03-25 11:00:16
Antpool does this like all the time, idk why

Where are you living? Circle does not support all countries.

Obviously it's going to be a piggy QR now.

Wtf did I just read

I would really like to order one! Are there any resellers in Europe? Or how could I get one?  
Edit: how does the shirt looks like?

To accept - when could that be?
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:08:24
If implemented in supermarkets, how would you deal with the different prices of some products with the same barcode?  
Would that mean the seller has to keep his items listed and up to date in a specific database?

How to know if my node shows up on the map?  
Great idea btw!!

Afaik you can set the miner's fee manually in i.e. Mycelium. It's a great app, you should give it a try.

but...but... that's not fair
