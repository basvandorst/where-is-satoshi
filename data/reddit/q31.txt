Man, this is pretty damn funny. Even more so when thinking about the poor folks who are gonna do it.

The ATM I've used allows you to scan your wallet or print a new one. I can't speak for all ATMs but I'd imagine they operate nearly the same way. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:38:21
Because others are doing much quicker/cheaper transactions. All bitcoin has going right now is first. Soon first won't be enough to pull people from other coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:07:19
I've read that since I can't cancel the transaction, what I can do try a "double spend" with a higher fee. Is a double spend with a higher fee only an option using the same inputs to the same output as the original one?

Mycelium is what I'm using. I has the option to ~~RBF~~ cpfp, but when trying to select it, is says it's not possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:25:00
The existence of bitcoin is predicated on transactions of it. It's not a value that can survive as a stagnant network.
The notion that transactions are not important is silly. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:06:10
We were all really worried about what you might do. Now we don't have to. That's good! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:15:08
You are a special kind of worthless.

My experience tells me that you can't mine without proper equipment because you're too slow to contribute. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:43:59
Get out now, before it gets worse. Binance gave me BCX and SBTC credits the other day. I've not heard of many others doing that. They are a really good exchange and you can do 2 BTC of movement a day on an unverified account. 
Also, XRP is making good money and doesn't cost hardly anything to move around. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:40:58
I sent my card and valid passport pictures, but was sent a denial message because of "invalid ID". I'm going on a week now waiting for verification. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:35:21
Many claim that this will not be the norm, because different protocols are being tested to replace this model, but who's to say it will be adopted?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:24:01
I just put 700 in an ATM and I wasn't comfortable with either option, I ended up moving it to a paper that I printed from home, but I lost like 80 bucks in fees after moving it three times. 
Just give careful consideration about how you can move it as few times as possible and get the money where  you want. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:16:58
No they didn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:31:27
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:38:40
Binance is way better.
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:16:06
I'd say it shows the importance of intelligent use. Don't use a company that hides your address from you.  
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:31:03
@_date: 2014-02-23 22:58:32
I didn't realize it was so far away. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 22:19:31
Making it not viable for a regularly used currency, right?  
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:31:24
Yep 
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:26:39
Businesses will comply, they have an address, and universal adoption by them has long been a goal.

@_date: 2014-02-10 22:56:14
I only have a blockchain wallet. Do all wallets not operate in the same manner? 
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:30:56
Question: why or how would MT. Gox be able to stop the movement of coins out of a wallet?  If you know your address why not just move them and be done. The blockchain is the Ledger not the wallet so it will keep track of things.  
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:34:18
Thank you much! 
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:32:15
Medicare is though. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:35:51
Isn't that what op said already? Thought it was the fee. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:47:07
It means hold and it's fucking stupid!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:07:04
Dirty filthy beggar. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:53:46
But you're not at home, you're standing on the shore watching bitcoin sail away. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:44:57
Yeah, you missed the boat. Go home. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:30:50
Just like all the other times it never recovered? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:47:07
Better get to lashing them timbers then. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:02:26
Asking for money is about as rude as it gets. Take your own advice you beggar. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:57:24
I wish I knew you so I could slap you. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:38:47
Can I ask you a serious question. Why would you follow any financial advice you've received off of Reddit?
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:10:32
Man I almost don't believe you. Gemini hates dealing in such little amounts and makes it hard to do. They don't want the dude buying 50 bucks worth over there. They have bigger fish. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:02:17
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:07:46
Store it in a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:00:10
Supply isn't really critical. Coins can be split so far that 21 million coins is enough. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:04:10
The procedure would be to hit YouTube and watch some of the 100s of videos addressing this very topic. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:57:46
Seems odd. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:59:56
Why in the hell do people keep trying to predict the fall of Bitcoin?
Nobody knows what the fuck the future holds for it but everyone has been wrong thus far. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:02:17
I have to admit, I was not aware of the blockchain app. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 02:33:29
I figured nsa and google were close enough that the BTC world would shy from anything google. Thanks for the info though!
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:29:25
True but it's still....
@_date: 2013-10-29 01:07:55
not going to post a bunch of places. just wanna see how it works. If i get some cool, if not, oh well.
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:20:06
That sucks. So at the end of the day, this is a hackers currency.
@_date: 2013-11-01 06:29:05
Well my storage unit has power that they don't charge for. There are no other utilities but I could get a Freedom Pop connection or maybe a tmobile phone with data? Maybe snatch up one of the miners on ebay and perhaps make a little money. 
I'll admit, I don't have any idea how the miners work, I just see people talking about how hard it is to make money now that the difficulty is so high. But If I don't have to pay for power and adequate internet is 30 bucks, I should be able to make a little money, Right? Plus, winter's coming so I won't have to cool the unit for 6 months. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 01:57:22
Hmm, I guess I thought of is as just the opposite. I thought writing it down and having a hard copy is the worst way to go versus stashing it in a file somewhere. 
Thanks for the input though!
@_date: 2013-11-01 06:50:38
Well there is a knc saturn on ebay for a thousand bucks. 300gh. That'll take a while at 25 a month to pay off.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:26:54
The thing that's odd to me. The story has been the same since it was priced @ 75. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:59:44
What if we miss the moon and the rocket is lost in space. Will people be mad?
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:17:37
That's why I love Deep Freeze!! Nothing that I know of sticks to deep freeze.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:26:36
I'd guess it's nearly inevitable. There are many coins being lost to forgotten passwords and forgotten addresses all the time. I guess, they are not ever forever lost, but almost.
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:41:39
I get it, if someone gives you a 20 dollar bill you don't worry about who had it before or how they got it.
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:06:12
Aren't coins movements tracked through blockchain?  
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:44:03
Now what? 
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:37:30
Just sucks a little.  They can watch the input.io guy steal coin after coin but can't stop it. We need some digital bullets to fire at folks.  
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:26:51
Pay the miners to perform your transaction.  
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:50:49
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:42:54
not my toe print. I pickup almost nothing with my toes.
@_date: 2013-10-27 16:22:18
This is the sort if shit that will continue to keep bitcoin on the radar of regulators and probably be its demise. 
Everyone keeps blasting op for using PayPal because they don't offer protection but why can't people just be honest? He got bitcoins and paid the correct money for them. Why be a shitty human and reverse the charges? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:38:40
A card doesn't have an IP address nor can it get viruses.
All the current coin holders in the world need this currency to get easier to use or it will remain fringe. A card is the thing most used today.  Bitcoin needs to find an in. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:37:29
But you can set it to wipe itself after 5 wrong attempts. So you just swipe 5 wrong fingers and it's cleared out. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:27:00
The inputs.io hack, were those coins lying around or a bad break? 
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:00:41
Well if someone has coins that there isn't a valid transaction for, they should be pulled.  
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:28:44
This is the new best "doesn't fit in my brain" example! What a fun day this is turning out to be.
Can I just ask quickly, since you are way better at math than I am. How many gallons of water would it take to grow all the wheat to make this much flower? Think it would be a lot?
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:12:15
If my wallet is hacked and the coins are moved, that movement is done via the blockchain? 
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:45:53
I have a blockchain wallet, with 35btc in it and a 15+ password. Now that should be a secure wallet, if that money is stolen, this currency sucks.  
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:29:42
Can I ask you something? How long was your password? I'm shocked that this happens so often when this is supposed to be so secure. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:27:04
I suppose these are close to what I envision.
My idea, just a card cost and then it deals in bitcoin only. So no trans fees or anything else.  
@_date: 2013-10-29 01:36:59
well, I've got to put the identifier somewhere. I'm too stupid to memorize it all. It took all the power my brain has to come up with and remember a 19 character password that I feel good about. There is no more room.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:50:18
So I do have free electricity and a free 2gb/m internet connection.  How fast of a dedicated rig do I need to make any money? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:20:48
FUCK YEAH!!!!!!!!! GOT IT IN MY ACCOUNT. COOL FUCKING DEAL MAN!! 
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:17:19
Doesn't it suck a little bit that it only took a few hours? 
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:43:44
What about fractional coins combining into whole coins? Seems like that would really muddy the water after a while.  
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:05:09
No, probably not. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:14:32
missing the point here JP. A patent suggests that you'd like to profit from this great idea of yours. Bitcoin is lived as an anti JP Chase. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:54:19
Is that a lot? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:16:37
I think it has to happen for it to go mainstream. It has to get simpler and safer.
It seems to me that you'd be able to use a password in this situation that far exceeds stuff that you could remember or would even want to.
