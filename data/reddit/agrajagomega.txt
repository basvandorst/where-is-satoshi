But if I want to send someone some money through a Lightning transaction, they first need to deposit some money.
I can't say "Hey Dad, I'll send you $5 for that coffee" without him first logging on to an exchange and buying bitcoin...?
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:36:40
ok, that second point is fair. Want to use the network, put in a deposit. I accept that.
The first point is that for the last 6 years I've got very used to being able to _*literally*_ just handing someone a coin! "What's your address? ok, you have bitcoin in your account!"
No questions or requirements. Seems like a bit of a step backwards, but I get that the added benefits of speed and cheapness come at a price.

When sending one transaction costs more than running a node for a month, decentralization is already doomed.

I have both coins and want both to succeed. What is in my post history that isn't accurate discussion of the pros and cons of both coins? I want Lightning to succeed but I think this will be a problem to adoption and I'm trying to make sure I'm understanding it right.
You have such a fucking complex man.

Not true
100x 50c transaction fees or 1000x 5c transaction fees both generate the same profit for a miner. Miners want more capacity.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:08:32
They can have 8x as many transactions before they reach the same point. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:54:28
Yeah, that's my point. If you have to open a channel, well that's not the end of the world. But having to deposit enough to cover the counterparty before you can even receive bitcoin is a bit of a problem for me...
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:31:32
At first I was asking if it is true that you need to deposit/have the funds equal to what you wish to receive, in your lightning wallet before you can receive it (people have answered: That is true).
The follow up is: Explain why the users would do that as it is a very unusual practice that I have never seen before.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:55:28
More like a prepaid debit card, because the plan is that lots of different places will accept it, but you still have to pick your money in. 
I don't have enough money sitting around paycheck to paycheck to lock it into an account, so lightning will be useless if I need to transfer in small amounts all the time... 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:19:09
My example of sending $20 to someone is super generic! Your examples of buying expensive hardware or someone not even owning a bank account are more obscure cases.
I do appreciate the effort in trying to explain this as I can only imagine that for so many people to be on board, I must be missing something that everyone else sees.
Most responses to low value transactions and high fees are "use lightning" but as you say, new users couldn't do that and I wonder if it will just keep people out of the ecosystem.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:07:19
You don't get banned for that, it's an old guideline that the admins made to stop people spamming but they've recently said they're stopping that anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:19:26
I'm not talking about merchants though, I'm worried that this will make it impossible to get people to even sign up, if you need to dump a bag of cash into it before even being allowed to receive anything.
Edit: Wait, that's not the point in the OP. You realise that it's not just the opening of a channel, but the depositing of funds TOO.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:52:28
You're describing segwit2x, which was a "kick the can down the road" plan all along, but people went crazy about corporate takeovers when there is literally no problem with increasing a limit implemented 5 years ago for a problem that doesn't exist anymore. 
The fact that the miners and corporations supported it isn't grounds for hating it. Too much emotion over logic. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:53:11
I don't think you get the point here.... It's not about paying the transaction fee to get the account, it's about having to deposit enough to balance the counterparty before you can recieve.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:59:45
I was on blockfolio and just tried this out, and this one has a much nicer interface if nothing else.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:59:25
A blocksize of 1.1mb would increase capacity by 10%. 1.5mb by 50%. There is literally no downside. 
People want to use Bitcoin but it's being held back while we wait for the 'perfect' solution.

Look, I don't know if this is some American thing or what, but I work with a constant stream of European people coming to the UK and they open up bank accounts with zero deposits so that they can get their paycheck put into there.

wow, out of context much? A post about bitcoin being like burger king is being talked about. Someone says:




and I point out that it's the top thread in All accurate points.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:07:10
Ok, I want to pay a friend $20 for dinner. They say "Hey, why don't you send me it in bitcoin, I've never used it before". 
I either spend $25+ if we're in a high fee period, or I say "Ok, first, you need to buy $20 of bitcoin and put it into this wallet, then I'll send you it and you'll have $40".
That's right, right?
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:28:36
Wait. That is new information, and exactly the opposite of what's being said in the OP which is why I was questioning it. So two people can open a channel to each other and that doesn't require counterparty funding?
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:27:13
I think you're being intentionally dense. This entire thread is not about spending, it's about receiving bitcoin.
Never in the world have you had to deposit money in an account before you could be paid by someone else...
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:30:39
Funds in a lightning account can definitely not be paid into a normal bitcoin address... It's a totally different off chain transaction type.

Lightning is a prepaid debit card. You put your money into it and then spend it over time, at places that accept it. Based on the number of stores that have ever accepted bitcoin, that will be limited, and an even smaller proportion of those hold the bitcoin rather than convert to fiat immediately.
Lightning only solves scaling if a critical mass decide to lock their bitcoin into it, and I doubt that will happen for a long time, if ever.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:10:51
Yeah, but it's two different currencies basically. You can spend bitcoin anywhere bitcoin is spent, and you can spend Lightning Funds anywhere Lightning is spent, but they're not the same?

It's not an altcoin because it's just trying to persuade people to bitcoin differently. Whatever is being used by the majority is bitcoin if it's still the continuous string blocks reaching back to the genesis block.
If you invent a new English word and get enough people to use it, it becomes an English word by virtue of everyone accepts it.

@_date: 2017-03-22 12:27:56
Yeah, 2 years ago the argument was "let's bump blocksize up so the network can keep running as expected until lightning arrives" 
Lightning is still not ready so people are taking drastic actions.
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:25:38
Block size increase then Segwit then lightning, what's so god damn hard about this. Am I taking crazy pills?! 
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:12:28
This is exactly right. 
If people see an iceberg ahead they'll grab on to any lifeboat, inflatable raft or floating bit of wood. A lot of people see the block limit as a critical obstacle for bitcoin and it seems like the ship has been heading for it for years. 
I'm not saying BU is the flagship of the royal navy, but if you're on the titanic you either hold on and hope the captain will steer away, or you jump ship to something that offers a chance.

The problem isn't the network having 'any fee', it's that the fee makes it unusable for the originally defined purpose of bitcoin. Sure we can argue that the true functionality has evolved, but the idea that most people signed on for was peer to peer electronic cash.
I'm not trying to make an argument for how the network should run or what should change. I'm stating that the network in it's current state isn't the network that most people chose to become part of from genesis to around a year ago when fees skyrocketed and most people got priced out.
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:58:52

Right now 5% of a $10 transaction would be in fees, and that percentage is likely to grow soon. $10 is more than most people on earth earn in a week and can't be called a micro transaction by any means. Do you really think that Satoshi created bitcoin to act as a backbone for large international transfers by banks and governments? What kind of transactions do you ***think*** were supposed to be sent on bitcoin?
Things not being cool any more isn't an example of a product changing its function, that's a terrible analogy. That's user dynamics. The equivalent is the developers adding games with incessant notifications and driving users away. That kind of top down interfering with how users want to use the system is the comparison we're looking at.
You are very patronising and appear to only have a simplistic understanding, while clinging to a few soundbites which you've heard. The inability to change is what's occurring, and that's going to price most regular people out of bitcoin.
* 100 transactions with 1$ fee = $100
* 10,000 transactions with $0.01 fee = $100
The miner fee supplementation was designed to increase with more users, not charging the existing users more.

Try using an impartial source:

100% agree. I don't understand the core argument of "no blocksize increase under any circumstances".
If 99% of hashpower ends up going &gt;1MB I think they'd be better pushing to 2MB rather than quitting bitcoin altogether.
I mean, obviously Adam Black etc will have to work on whatever ends up being the major chain (used by exchanges etc) because Blockstream's sidechains will have to be interacting with the economic majority.
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:49:27
I don't know if you weren't around back then or whether the rules have been changed, but Theymos explicitly said any talk about 'consensus changing software' for example XT was off topic and that it would not be allowed in any way, and that if 90% of users left that was fine, but that was the rule.

There are a lot of people using bitcoin at the moment and it makes people compete for transactions. 
The fee you paid (around $0.13) is much lower than its currently needed. It's currently ~$0.58 according to 
This is an annoying thing and there are people who are looking for to remedy this but I wouldn't expect fees and congestion to go down any time soon. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:22:40

@_date: 2017-03-22 15:53:53
People were saying 2MB when we saw blocks inevitably filling and said we need to get ahead of it, to give more time for real scaling solutions. 
Now we're in it and people are losing their shit and lots are moving to new software to solve the problem (for better or worse).
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:49:46
You say that, but a lot of the comments/tweets are "hur dur, BU can't even find their own bugs", which isn't the case here. 
And announcing it to a userbase which is hostile to the network an hour after it was found is obviously just asking people to exploit it rather than letting the devs fix it, which any normal open source coder would do.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:11:07
There is nothing special about 1mb and the core outlook that even 1.1mb would be too much is what makes people realise that they're not serious about scaling the blockchain and it's all about second layer solutions.

It makes no sense to standardise at mBTC if that means you're going to start saying 5.23 mBTC. Nobody *WANTS* to use decimals and many currencies of the world work in hundreds or thousands and don't require decimalisation. Encouraging use of uBTC and 'bits' is much more useful and is built into to many wallets already. It won't be long before you're buying a can of coke for 0.1 mBTC and you're back to the problem you're describing and 100 bits to 50c is much easier to grasp.
I wrote this for the wiki about 4 years ago and it's as relevant today as it was then although I've updated the price:
 Bitcoin Units
One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of £/$/€) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:
Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for milli i.e. millilitre (mL) or millimetre (mm)
microbitcoin | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for micro i.e microlitre (μL) or micrometre (μm)
bit |bit| 1,000,000 per bitcoin| Colloquial "slang" term for microbitcoin
satoshi |sat| 100,000,000 per bitcoin| Smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor
For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $5,000 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:
* 0.002 BTC
* 2 mBTC
* 2,000 bits

I'm not saying that at all, you misunderstand.
I'm saying there is **not infinite demand**, therefore supply will never need to be infinite. Demand can be high, it can be very high, but it can't be infinite because there will always be a cost associated with the product (blockspace or electricity).

How do you know what the community wants? What most people want is fast transactions and cheap fees and they don't have any interest in how the tech works. 
On reddit you just get the hardcore fans and in this sub you only get  folks. Not really representative.

I mean, we in this context is 95% of the developed world as most people from Western countries outside of America support that statement.

CEOs didn't just invent 2X, it is literally what the community had been crying out for for YEARS, and they made an agreement to put it in place because the core developers weren't taking steps to scale.
I mean, I'm not making this shit up. You can disagree with whether it should be happening, but options to scale up have been asked for for 5 years and no steps were taken until an 'opposition' group came into existence.
It's why every democracy in the world needs an opposition party, and every dictatorship ends up living in the past and not changing.

Lol. I'm personally not doing anything. I'm leaving my stuff in cold storage and then One day in the future I'll use whichever chain is running. Or maybe both.
But hey, feel free to have insignificant rants on social media on what international open source programmers and multi-national corporations are planning to do. Because when it comes down to it we both know you'll use whichever chain has more value because you're not going to throw away all your money on 'principles'.

Hey buddy. If you want them gone I'm happy to take them off your hands.

There's going to be a fork, only time will tell which one people follow. People on either side can claim that theirs is the true one, but wherever the money goes is where the people will go.
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:03:37
Faster and cheaper transactions.

People seem to be using the term Bitcoin Legacy.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:50:08
Ledger, coinomi, Exodus, BTC.com, blockchain.info.....
Yeah, some wallets support it.
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:32:48
But which one is bitcoin and which one is the alt? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:32:12
Lol, dude, calm down.

It's currently the two top posts in there, so maybe you don't know what you're talking about, eh? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:00:46
I mean changing the 1MB limit to 2MB
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:42:36
No. Coinbase have specifically announced that all coins will be available on both chains (if two chains exist).
But it's still good practice to have the coins in your own storage anyway.

Because it's never been about the consensus, it is about crippling capacity to force sidechains on people.

Pretty much every major city had them installed at the popular second hand DVD stores CEX (not related to the exchange), but they got taken out after about 2 years when they weren't popular enough.

I'm not saying my opinion, I'm just saying what it adds.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:10:45
Also, if blocks are every 20 minutes, there will be twice as many transactions competing per block, so fees are going to shoot up. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:01:54
Is increasing throughput not of value? There is obviously value, you just don't like the assumed compromise. Spreading disingenuous lies about this isn't helping your case.
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:04:29
Because the core devs are committed to pushing things onto side chains. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:38:58
Why do you think changing the number from 1 to 2 is a corporate take over? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 09:59:59
It doesn't matter how it's pushed if the thing they're pushing is sound.

If companies and miners adopted segwit because of the USAF, then they would be using Segwti now, but currently only ~10% of transactions are. 
They adopted it because of S2X, which is the reason not many companies have started using it yet. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:01:22
Lol. People have been talking about the 2MB bump from before segregated witness had even been suggested! 
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:17:47
They are likely going to run on Bitcoin2X rather than Bitcoin1X. That's literally it. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:27:05
It's clearly using the term "fake Bitcoin" in a way that is referring to BCH though. It's obvious that they'd not accept that. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:37:50
It needs the whole 2MB+SW to be flagged for people to trust the 2mb will actually happen though. 
The 2mb + SW Hong Kong agreement was assumed to be happening by lots of people (right or wrong) but then never went anywhere.

As I wrote for the sticky thread a million years ago now:
 Bitcoin Units
One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of £/$/€) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:
Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for milli i.e. millilitre (mL) or millimetre (mm)
microbitcoin | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for micro i.e microlitre (μL) or micrometre (μm)
bit |bit| 1,000,000 per bitcoin| Colloquial "slang" term for microbitcoin
satoshi |sat| 100,000,000 per bitcoin| Smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor
For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $500 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:
* 0.02 BTC
* 20 mBTC
* 20,000 bits
For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](

Imagine if you took a time machine back to 3 years ago and told people that bitcoin would one day take over a dollar to send and see the absolute disgust in peoples eyes.

He thinks it's insufficient, if a blocksize increase is included with segwit I doubt any significant number of people would have an issue.
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:30:26
Lol, that's not the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:32:29
Yeah, Core has contributors from all around the world, but the majority of the top ones and the ones directing the project are employed by the same company. There is your industrial take over...
