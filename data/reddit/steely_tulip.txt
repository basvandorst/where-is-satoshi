I buy on the first of the month, every month, regardless of the price.
Bought at 11k and then it took the tumble.
I mean i still check the price and feel a little anxiety. You'd have to be less than human if you genuinely felt nothing. It's a great exercise to learn patience and self-control, but let's not pretend HODLRs are cold calculating robots over here.

You sold someone elses 1 btc at 11k. You then buy a new btc at 8k, leaving you with 3k, which is yours. You just need to return the 1 BTC to the original owner; so you are up 3k USD from this exchange

Sure he's a climate denier. Ok - he promised to make the US richer - can-t do that whilst fighting global warming. But let's do a few of these.


That's an opinion that many top economists disagree about. This cannot be a 'lie', unless you are a bigot (don't accept any views but your own)


Again, this cannot possibly be a lie. Of course scientists have agendas - wtf - they're people too?


WTF - the article even says this is true. This is obviously true as any climate scientist knows - man made global warming is accelerated natural warming. 'They were going to be gone' refers to dumbass Al Gore statements that they would be gone by 2020
The next one is the tweet that we could use some global warming, that only the US will pay trillions to fight global warming. It is 100% true that the US pays more to lower emissions and enforce climate regulations than any country, it is 100% true that no country has honored its paris accord duties, and pay trillions is again a reference to the cost to the economy of cutting back emissions. Which is an economic opinion shared by many experts.
Moving to the other link for a few:


Obama literally said he wanted a meeting during his reelection CNN debate with Mitt Romney, and ultimately never had one. Why not?


It is a fact the law of separation [came into effect under Obama]( Under Obama it was not strictly enforced though.


Look at the context - he meant in the EU, which is true. That's what the meeting was about.
See how easy this is?

Right, facts:
1) [nearly 95% of Obama's job creations were temporary employment]( This is the sign of a weak economy 8 years after the recession. 
2) Early in his presidency Obama was only overseeing the recovery of the recession, so the numbers were bouncing back. You might claim he managed that well, but it would be foolish to compare it to Trump's situation. [Obama's later economy was generally weak in many aspects](
3a) [Obama's economic failures stemmed from his aggressive regulations...](
3b) [...while Trump's deregulation policy is the driving force of his economic success.](
3c) Your article is classic TDS garbage. Obama's debt is acknowledged at +$9 Tn, Trump is at +$2 right now. Your article states Trump's debt is **projected** to surpass Obama's, but the entire argument of right wing economics is that de-regulation and lowering taxes **actually increases** revenue, by... wait for it... building the economy. So how about you wait for the actual numbers to come in before flaunting as true something that really isn't. You don't like right wing economics - argue against that and the tens of thousands of expert economists who support it. Don't argue bullshit.
4) Yeah every left wing economist is forecasting the end of the world because Trump. Just like they accurately forecast the economy would be fine in 2008, and that it would crash if Trump was elected. If people could forecast economics accurately they would be billionaires not academics. Yes i know there are billionaires who hate Trump - doesn't mean they can predict the future either.
5) You have no idea what is going on with North Korea. The South Korean president does, and he suggested Trump should get a Nobel peace prize. Maybe give him a call and explain how that article you read in HuffPo the other day means he's a moron?

I'm incredibly bored at work so why not?
All the below can be used to refer to any market asset (share) or currency or whatever
Long - Betting that Bitcoin will go up. You buy low, the price rises, then you sell high and make a profit. Or you wait until it goes even higher. You are long on Bitcoin, or you have a long position (or market order).
Short - A little more complicated. You bet that the price will go down and you want to make money off this, but you can't just buy bitcoin - how would that work? So you borrow someone else's Bitcoin and you sell it on the market for 11K. Then you wait and when the price goes down you buy new Bitcoin at 8K, which you then give back to the original owner. Except because you sold at 11K, you made 3K profit. You are shorting Bitcoin, or you have a Short position.
Open position - You have a declared desire to buy or sell Bitcoin, which is displayed on a market orders sheet somewhere (like Bitmex) so people can see it and respond.
Liquidation - you close the position, normally while realizing a loss. In this case Bitcoin didn't go down so people with short positions had to buy Bitcoin at a higher price and close their low price market orders.
Bull Market - The market price is going up, or everyone expects it to go up.
Bear Market - The market price is going down, or everyone expects it to go down.
@_date: 2019-07-08 13:44:33
You have to borrow because you need to have something to sell at the current price which you didn't pay for.
The operation is exactly the same as a long bet. You buy low and sell high, but in the opposite order. If we know the price is going down, we need to perform the sell operation first, so we know we have the highest price. The only way to have something to sell without buying Bitcoin at 11K would be to borrow it.
So you owe the other guy 4 BTC, and all that needs to happen afterwards is that you give him back his 4 BTC. If the market has dropped you bought it at a profit, if it has risen you suffered a loss.

I often get into arguments with friends who can't understand the point of Bitcoin (because they're statists). They say the value is not based on anything - but it's based on the value that we attach to a wonder of the modern world - a completely decentralized currency outside the control of any power hungry elites. This is a game changer for civilization.
Many of us i think are willing to risk money on the possibility that Bitcoin's final value is 8K or something similar - because there is a higher purpose to this than quick profit, and we believe in that purpose more than we need Lamborghinis. 
But this is why i believe the price will always rise - because the HODLERS are a dedicated community who will always buy bitcoin no matter what. Sure, banks dump and pump and the value fluctuates wildly, but it will always be fluctuating above a bedrock level that is growing slowly but unstoppably - October's price movements bear this out. 
This is an ideological movement for freedom and nobody is going to take it away from us.

In 1920 people would have said the same about the automobile. People adapt when they have to, and where there are difficulties they invent technology to support themselves. It's not hard to imagine a private hardware keys wallet locked in a safe, or the ability to insure your bitcoin wallet.

But truth be told there is a darker side to this. Nobody in the world wants to be the moron who passed on free money - so all the people who ridiculed you are now emotionally invested in your failure. This is why they can be so shitty about it.

To the global elites, bitcoin is a cool programming project a bunch of nerds are wasting their money gambling on.
To the daytraders and manipulators, it's a get rich quick scheme.
To the HODLERS it is a proof of concept that technology can secure, even enforce global decentralization. There is going to be an immense shitstorm when the elites start waking up to this.
There is no going back - this is a revolution.

Couple of points you should add in:
 
* Lafayette was a stabilizing force in the French Revolution until he **refused** to side with the mob and went into exile - one of many reasons it descended into a bloodbath...
* France actually was on the verge of bankruptcy when they supported the US war of independence. I'm not saying this alone drove them over the edge and caused the revolution, but it contributed.

Garbage article that completely misses the point. 


Bitcoin does not have a central bank therefore does not have value as a currency?
This is the kind of blinkered close-minded devotion to monetary theory that is destroying the western world.
Also, to compare Bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme is just asinine, and shows the writer does not remotely understand Bitcoin.

Your link does not have 7 different links. It has the image i described, plus a link to 
Neither Rubin Report or Dave Rubin appear on that page, and for the sites that are listed, all it says is that these media groups are "partners". So you have no evidence whatsoever about financial matters.
EDIT: Fine there are 7 'links'. 2 of them are duplicate, so there are actually 5. One is a news article that doesn't mention Rubin anywhere, the other 4 are just front pages for organizations that don't link to Dave Rubin.

You seem not to have understood Bitcoin at all, or why we are talking about the revolutionary power of Bitcoin


Where have you seen people trying to argue that Bitcoin solves inequality? I'm a capitalist and i don't believe we will ever end inequality.


How do you know anything about my economic views from a 4 line comment? Statements like this just make you look incredibly self absorbed and ignorant.
Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that is secured by code alone. Its fundamental value has nothing to do with wealth, it comes from the way it changes financial relations between people. At the moment currency has to be secured by powerful institutions, and can be manipulated by those institutions. 
Central banks print money, inflate it, set interest rates - all kinds of actions that can wreak havoc on an economy. Private banks are so large they can control the basic transactions around the world. Carl Benjamin has become an enemy of the state, and Mastercard has so much power and influence they can stop him taking part in the free market. They can block your accounts, take or spend your money without your consent, and enforce bullshit rules on what kind of business you are allowed to engage in.
Bitcoin destroys all of that - it makes the market truly free, giving ordinary people a completely unfettered store of value and a way around economic collapse. Yes, Bitcoin's value is only what people say it will be - but because of these unique advantages that make it incredibly value worldwide.


The other poster is right, you are a deluded fool. Or a teenager.

@_date: 2019-05-28 09:55:42
That's a great explanation and really brings it down to the fundamentals.
I think this is a two part answer though, because you could extend that question to 'why was it necessary to solve the double spend problem, when there is already a solution called Banks'? This is an easy topic to get lost in. 
I might rephrase to a more catchy 'why does the world laugh at Bitcoin, and why are Bitcoiners laughing at the world?'
When we define a currency, most definitions accept that it needs to be a medium of exchange and a reliable store of value. How can i know the thing in my hand means anything to other people?
In the ancient world, the obvious solution to this was precious metal. I have a chunk of something in my hand that has innate value. If someone wants to take that value, they have to physically remove it from my person. Of course the weakness with precious metal is that its value is subject to environmental changes - e.g. when the Carthaginians open up huge silver deposits in Spain, the Roman coin is suddenly threatened with devaluation.
Today precious metals have industrial applications, but these change with technology and consumer demand - so precious metal is not quite as stable as we would prefer. More importantly, various state powers are not content to suffer the limitations that a metal based currency places on their control of society. The supply of money is limited to however much metal we dig out of the ground, and we don't have all the world's supply inside our borders so we can't control other nations' supply of metal and we can't even control the international trade of that metal.
But wait - we don't have to bow to these limitations. We have lots of strong men with swords, and precious metal is after all something you can walk up to and take - provided nobody can stop you. So the States of the world each create a standard coin, which is composed of a unique mix of metals and bears the seal of the state, and which is mandatory to use inside that state. If people didn't like it, well they could discuss it with the Roman army (the legions were very good at winning debates).
This gives the state huge advantages - it can set whatever value of the currency it likes - it can 'create' more money to pay for its wars, it can restrict the currency to control businesses, and it can protect its currency from duplication by using metal recipes and seals that are difficult to reproduce, but easy to verify. 
Of course it's only a short leap of logic to transform your understanding of what currency is. A coin isn't valuable because it has metal in it, it's valuable because a large standing army says that it is. Now the only reason we are limited to metal is its durability - it can last a thousand years without decaying, so coins are reliable. So this new understanding continues until the modern age, when technology changes the nature of coins.
Obviously with the invention of mass printing we can have more sophisticated accounting and paper money. Paper money continues our understanding that the coin (or note) has value because people agree that it does, and a large army exists to enforce that understanding. There is a new problem though, since the paper only represents the idea of the coin - it doesn't have its intrinsic metallic value, and it's easy to destroy or damage. This is only a minor problem because we can easily replace paper notes - but this introduces us to the Double Spend problem described by OP. Money is really more a series of numbers in a ledge somewhere, but we can still rely on this because Banks control the ledgers and the banks are backed up, as always, by lots of violent men with weapons. It turns out violent men with weapons are a great way of arranging societal consensus, even though it occasionally gets messy.
Then once we develop electronic systems, the principle continues essentially unchanged- we have just replaced book ledgers with databases, and notes are used less commonly than credit cards.
But you know, modern men and women are starting to get fed up with having states run roughshod over our businesses according to whatever set of whimsical, religious or ideological beliefs they choose to pursue. They set up rules which they don't understand, and refuse to take responsibility when those rules have bad consequences. They can do what they want because they control the money, and they control the money because of those guys with guns. Well, also it would be inconvenient to go back to gold, because it brings up all those old problems, and in any case, armies are better at controlling physical resources than citizens.
But along comes the internet. So remember we now know that we don't need currency to have any actual value - it just needs people to agree that it has value. Previously we needed guns to make that happen, or else people would abuse the double spend problem. But now we have a technological solution - a decentralized open source solution that is democratic - 51% of the users agree on something. This system is still enforced, not by guns, but by cryptography - and the great thing about cryptography is that it doesn't need anyone to control it.
And the best part is that no state power can control it, stop it, or manipulate it (without playing by the rules of the system). So that means, like the gold coin, that coin is yours to keep, to give to whoever you want, whenever you want, and for whatever reason you want. But unlike a gold coin, it can't be taken by tough guys with swords.
