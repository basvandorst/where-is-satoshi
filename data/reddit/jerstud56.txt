Unknownism. It could also pull back to 4K.

$5? I only got $1 when I did a referral just a few months ago...

I'd honestly be surprised if he got 3 years unfortunately.
@_date: 2015-06-07 05:14:10
Yeah that's all I noticed it's at like 175% zoom.

Keep in mind that is 2 of the 4 buildings they're constructing, most likely totaling 8-10% of the total networking power.

Tits for tips

To a jury or judge, sure. To a cop/TSA? Other way around.
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:47:13
Double that price and you've got it.
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:11:36
That'd be a great time to buy.
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:00:37
Then you're just letting people take a picture of the front side of your card. Not a smart idea.
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:35:42
I like the one answer is .42

You suck, you fuck.
P.S. You really suck.
@_date: 2014-03-23 13:57:29
That means it's time to buy!

The guy holding the sign is "trolling" - he makes fun of bitcoin thinking it will eventually crash to nothing.
@_date: 2015-01-22 04:14:42
You mean B1 right? Bitcoin needs its own symbol like $

Dropping like a rock in the last hour...might as well keep HODLING.
Edit: Dropped nearly $200 in the last hour.

I'm going to be so rich
@_date: 2019-06-08 22:01:05
How'd you know my name?

Wait this show started again? I love this show. Off to watch it.

Real news on april fools. Holy shit. I wasn't, fortunately, affected by the whole thing, but I hope those that were get *something* back.
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:24:58
Understood. It's all a gamble really. Holding it forever can have a negative side effect too.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:23:56
It fluctuates enough recently where you could probably get in lower than 2100 again. If I would just sell high 2000s and but again low 2000s I'd be making a lot more than just holding what I've got.
