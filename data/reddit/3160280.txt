I already didn't like Shorten so this comment just reinforces my distaste for the man.

Sorry, but this is bullshit. These arbitrary points you've placed with no pattern on this graph do not prove anything. If you can predict the price of Bitcoin on Monday for the next month using this method, I'll give you 0.2BTC.

Culture Kings is trash but glad to see another business accepting Bitcoin.

Does anyone read the rules/sidebar anymore?

Absolutely not.

This is retarded. Forbes is a media outlet. The best possible thing they can do is to post different articles from various viewpoints on a range of topics. Just because they don't contribute to the circle-jerk and blindly follow one path doesn't mean they are contradicting themselves.

About time someone said it.
