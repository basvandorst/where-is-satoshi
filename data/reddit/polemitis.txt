it is good news.  without regulatory clarity, we have the current situation of 0 US-based exchanges.  there is no model of 'mainstreaming' BTC that does not include this as a step.

As Andreas says, if it is in fact Satoshi, then consider a 'thank you' to him and he probably will let it pass to charity anyway.
If not, well, let's make this guys month.

Hi everyone,
Antonis Polemitis here.  A few clarifying comments:
(1) The program is absolutely still open.   We are just changing some of the internal systems to accommodate registration. Stay tuned this week for more details.  :)
(2) The University is a big place and this is a new program.   Most people are not yet up to speed with the latest details as we have been working very hard the last couple of months to get everything in place.
So just be patient for a few more days.  :) 
Warm regards,

thanks!  I think the liquidity effect and the price effect are something you don't see in traditional marketplaces where you are not impacting the unit of account while you are transacting

Bravo Andrea.  And this is the right answer.  If one believes that journalists were irresponsible, the correct response is not to drop to that level but to rise to a higher level.
Thank you for taking this on your plate and let's make this a positive outcome for both Dorian and for BTC.

Let me look into this on how it would work for transfer credit.

Yes, that is him.
@_date: 2014-05-16 05:09:35
yup.  that is correct.  first payment was in 2013, but Caleb was very early too!  :)
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:24:43
Thank you!  Missed that.   CORRECTED!
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:49:13
Interesting.  Thanks.  Did not know that.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:31:35
I know...he gets around!
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:28:18
it is coming very soon and it will be free to attend (the MOOC)

I don't see that as the usage case.  The sovereign currency of Cyprus is the Euro and that is not going to change.   I think it is a potentially useful jurisdiction for the same reasons it is now - in EU, strong rule of law, sophisticated professional services, low tax rate and the rest
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:34:16
look, its a legitimate concern.  I have the following view on this:
(1) First of all, BTC will be adopted worldwide and all the major fin services hubs will jump on it.  Singapore is in the lead but NYC is getting there
(2) The Cyprus-as-black-list issue is true but deeply overblown.   There was a run-up of propaganda in advance of the EU imposing the haircut to build public support for the haircut (outside of Cyprus).
In the previous 8 years, Cyprus had been admitted to EU, to eurozone, was net contributor to EU budget and during that whole time period, their money was very welcome.  :)
And it is well-known that the amount of illicit money running through London, Switzerland, Delaware is orders of magnitude bigger than the whole Cyprus banking system.
So, there is no doubt that there were issues, but also there was some 'selective enforcement' in the Western media as well.   In any case, everyone is on best behavior now - there is no other choice the Cyprus banking system
(3) All the hype aside, as a structural jurisdiction, Cyprus remains the top choice as at the intersection of Western markets and former Soviet bloc markets, not just for Russian companies but for blue chip Western companies investing in Russia.
That has always been its main advantage (low-tax, not no-tax jurisdiction; English common law system; excellent professional services) - it is like all the ex-British colonies in that regard (HK, Singapore) but on a smaller scale.
Even if it only serves this usage case in the crypto-field, that will be fine.
