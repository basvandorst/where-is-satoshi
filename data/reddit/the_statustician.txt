You are thinking a little bit in reverse here I think.
The same thing that Napster -&gt; Limewire -&gt; BitTorrent did to music and movies will now be done to all types of copyrighted material via OpenBazaar. 
Since music and movies could be digitized they were "swallowed up" by the new and dsiruptive  technologies first.
Now all copyrighted things, like a Mickey Mouse t-shirt, will be usurped by OpenBazaar since sellers will produce these copyrighted physical goods and sell them untraceably. 
OpenBazaar is the end of copyright of easily transferable physical goods as we know it. 
This is not good or bad, it just is. Technology is the harbinger of change and society has always found a way to adapt.

Let's also not forget how exploitative the music industry was. While there was certainly a time and place for the artist-company partnership, artists typically received a meager percentage of the music sales of their work. Today, touring is much more lucrative than the production and sales of music.
So your 99 cents today is worth more than the $15 of yesteryear from the artist's perspective.
