Same thing man, I sure hope not..

I think there needs to be a proper step by step guide on how to obtain your first bitcoin, how to make a payment with it, and later on how to make bigger transaction through bitcoin market places.
It took me quite long to figure out how bitcoin worked simply because the main sites containing the information are rather poorly structured and lack a lot of basic information for new users... If I have time once, I might take the effort to make this step by step guide for new users.

Ah so everyone who doesn't agree with the chart is in denial?
Can you exclude the possibility that it was a DDOS attack? To me it seems like there is more than enough evidence it was a DDOS, but excuse my denialish point of view
@_date: 2013-10-03 18:40:21
Yeah or as mentioned in another thread: they could've used NSA's data to find everything out, and then backwardly use "old fashioned police work" to provide evidence that doesn't link to the NSA. It's pretty scary when you think of it.

The price will only stabilize, if everyone who wants a bitcoin has a bitcoin. Before that, increase of demand will cause prices to rise. 
Maybe we will reach stabilization in the sense that every person in his right mind wont invest in a currency like this anymore. This DDOS has caused incredibly lose of trust, so I doubt bitcoin will ever be able to become a proper currency when it is so incredibly vulnurable.

Now that you know that this bug has been around for a month at least, how much credibility is there to these statements?
There have been people actively abusing this bug and making profit in the form of bitcoins from making these double transaction. They obtained double or more the amount of bitcoins from the same amount of money. These bitcoins have been withdrawn from the site to other wallets during the last two months, and are thus gone, meaning this is an irreversible loss for the site.
This source shows us that the owner has actually been aware of this bug but tried to cover it up. Meanwhile his exchange has most likely been making a ton of losses.
So, coming back to the statement on the bitcoin-24 site, that "all funds are safe". This is only possible IF and only IF every single loss the site has made due to the bug, can be covered by the owner himself through his own reserve of bitcoins and money. If he cannot cover all losses by himself, this inherently means the users of the site will have to pay for the losses (including me). This lost money isn't going to come flying out of thin air.

I believe the polish accounts had like 25% compared to the german accounts
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:39:33
Man, I already felt like there was something wrong about bitcoin-24 so I removed every single fund from the site to mtGox (you can say a lot about mtgox but at least your funds are safe). Frankly when the market crashed it was impossible for me to sell my coins on mtGox due to the insane lag. I withdrew all my coins back to bitcoin-24 because that exchange was actually working. Sucks hard that my instinct was right not to trust bitcoin-24, but was forced to use the site anyways.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:57:43
These statements mean nothing unless the owner of the site has a proper buffer to compensate for the losses the glitch has caused. Unless the owner of the site is able to compensate for all the losses from the glitch that he's been consciously knowing of since one entire month (source:  it seems highly unlikely that every fund on the site is going to remain safe. Thus, the statements above mean nothing. I'm still waiting for a response to my e-mail adressing this issue.

Here, have mine:
This one's really hard :P
@_date: 2013-10-10 21:24:38
How is option 2 possible if they don't even know which accounts are being accused of money laundering? The only thing they could do is pay out the german customers and let the polish customers take the bullet which seems the worst and most unfair option
Also I agree with your vision on the third option. There's no way for us to check whether they're paying out the true ratio or putting some of it in their own pockets
@_date: 2013-05-19 11:56:30
Yup I'm in the same boat. Got money frozen in bitcoin-24 bank and now I can't get it out of mtgox either... 
@_date: 2013-06-03 17:24:42
Yeah took like 5 to 6 weeks for me :/
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:34:08
How is this relevant?
The price didn't drop because of market forces, it dropped because [of the] DDOS which caused panic.
@_date: 2013-05-07 12:44:53
To be honest I think people should stop wanting bitcoin to become a currency. Anonymosity, deflation, a huge amount of bitcoins in few hands, and the high volatility really do not make it appropriate as a currency. Yes, some of these issues would be "solved" IF it became widely adapted, but it never will become widely adapted because of said issues.
Instead think of it as virtual gold (a way to store value), or  as a medium for free and instant international trade. These are the only two advantages of bitcoin: it's better than gold because it's not physical (makes it easier and costless to attribute bitcoins to people), and it's better than a regular currency when it comes to transporting money around the globe (and only transporting). These are the two aspects that give bitcoins intrinsic value, and these are the two aspects that should be promoted. It's just pure delusion thinking that bitcoin will ever replace the euro or the dollar, or any other fiat currency, and it's a shame that people are trying to put this thought in other people's minds.
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:12:21
Isn't it possible to secure your bitcoins by making use of a wallet that requires a mobile authenticator? Just like bank payments? If you want to withdraw coins from your wallet you have to enter a code sent to your mobile phone? Could someone enlighten me on this?
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:56:10
Exactly, if Simon could give us a clarification on this that would be reassuring. It is impossible that no losses have been made since the bug has been around for a month when funds and bitcoins were still withdrawable.. Did he cover the losses with his own funds?
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:23:08
Honestly? 
The characteristic of a bubble is that an asset is overvalued. Once the value has reached such an extreme point that nobody is willing to pay for it anymore, the investors at the top of the bubble won't be willing to hold the risk, and start to sell. Once this happens, a chain reaction of sale can start and the bubble pops.
RISK and OVERVALUATION are economic forces that are the cause of a bubble. Risk and overvaluation will be the force affecting the supply and demand, and causing the bubble to pop. Yes, DDOS and nuclear bombs will also affect supply and demand, and thus an economic force still comes in to play (obviously), but ignoring the cause of the force affecting supply and demand is just plain ignorant. If you ignore the cause there's no way to assess whether it was a bubble in the first place or not.
It's simple logic. You choose to ignore the force causing the panic and causing the price drop, and thus you can never assess whether it was a bubble or not.
cause &gt; market force &gt; result
economic force &gt; market force &gt; price drop (could be a bubble)
external force &gt; market force &gt; price drop (could be fucking anything)
Yes market force always comes into play which is quite fucking obvious, but I agree that I may not have worded my posts properly. What I'm talking about is the cause affecting the market force. Hope we're on the same page now, and that you can see through the obvious.

that's 7 hours ago..
@_date: 2013-04-13 10:07:10
Because of this. 
Who's going to be paying for what the losses the bug has caused in the month that the site admin tried to cover it up?
@_date: 2013-04-28 20:49:33
He got permission from the authorities to let the bitcoins be withrdawn..
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:53:46
I doubt they can just do that. If only we had some more information we might be able to fight their decision.
Just don't expect your money any time soon.. I bet this is gonna take at least another 6 months.
@_date: 2013-05-31 15:45:04
Maybe Im just a pessimist, hope Im wrong. Eventhough bitcoins have been distributed its still possible for the fiat balances to be incorrect though.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:53:29
Please note that bitcoin-24 is also suffering from capacity issues.
A lot of people have transfered money to or from this site and are suffering from a huge delay. Deposits can take up to a week, withdraws even longer. 
Bitcoin-24 is a great site, but untill they get their stuff together and hire more people to cope with the capacity, it's just going to turn out the same as mtgox.
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:34:56
I've been waiting for one week now and it's still not validated. Contacted support to ask why it's taking so long and no answer either.
I was wondering how long it takes most people but apparently my validation is taking abnormally long :/

Depending on what you want your bitcoins for, you don't even need to go through all the fuss of creating a wallet and what not. 
If you just want to obtain few bitcoins, and then buy something from the bitcoins, it really doesn't have to be complicated, and there seems to be hardly any information about how to obtain your first bitcoins quickly.
This is how I obtained my first coin, and I found it to be the quickest and most convenient way: make an account on  *deposit* money from your bank into your bitcoin-24 account (takes 1-3 days depending where you're from). Once the money is there, bid with it on the market and voila, you have your first few bitcoins. The bitcoins you just obtained are actually stored in your bitcoin-24 account, which contains a wallet too. Now all you have to do is *withdraw* the bitcoins from your bitcoin-24 account wallet, to the wallet you want to make your payment. The wallet address will look something like this: 1GQExBiUJ56o4yLJfiA5kQFMZPGefNGpKF.
If you want to obtain your first bitcoins even faster, you can use the following link:  I personally haven't tried it but it should probably be just as easy, and faster. Just realise that you will probably be paying a bit more than usual for your first bitcoins this way, because of the additional speed.

Yeah got it today too lol. Glad I got everything out of Gox. Will never use it again
@_date: 2013-03-25 17:16:10
whoops i messed up on  and edited, thanks for answering
edit: as for ask price, I forgot to mention that I'd automatically like to sell the coins once they reach a certain value lower than the current value. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:02:59
How is the cause of the panic irrelevant? If that is the case, everything is a bubble, because anything can disrupt a market and cause the prices to fall. 
Let's say england gets nuked to the ground and the value of the pound drops to zero. Was the pound a bubble? Or do we say it is an external force that caused the market to crash? I'm using an extreme example because apparently you can't distinguish between economic forces and external forces.

Agree, there seems to be a circlejerk not to trust online wallets going on. However, I'm quite sure my pc could be infected with malware, which means an online wallet while making use of double authentication seems a lot safer against hacks and hardware failure. They most likely took a lot more measures to protect their servers than I did to protect my pc.
I also don't have the knowlede on how to make a paper/external wallet so there is quite a chance I or average joe would fuck up and lose his bitcoins in the process of doing so.
There's also the possibility that if your online wallet is hacked, you'll be refunded as instawallet has shown. I'd say for anyone under 5000eur worth of bitcoin, an online wallet (such as blockchain)is a lot more convenient.

EDIT: For clarification, everyone seems to be thinking the owner of the site is purposely trying to scam them. This is not the case, if the owner wanted to scame us he could've ran away with all our money a billion times and would've at least tried to remain anonymous. Right now, his face, name and adress are all available on the internet, so scamming us is the last thing on his mind. The problem is simply that the owner of the site was incredibly incompetent, and should've shut down the site immediately once he got to know the issue. For some reason he decided to put everything under the radar and hoped he could solve the issue on time. He obviously failed to do so and the problem has become worse and worse.

Yes you can go through my comment history to find more information and links. Right now im on my phone so I cant elaborate
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:59:27
Correct. If other people are using it too and it is the second biggest exchange, it must be good right? I myself am also guilty of thinking that way.

Polish bank account still frozen, and they can only pay out people who haven't been trading bitcoin yet from the german bank account, so there's still a long way. I also wouldn't be surprised that this is due to the trading engine bug, and people who have been trading in bitcoin might have an incorrect balance, so they can't be paid out.
@_date: 2013-04-13 09:50:17
Is it also a plus in your book that the admin has been consciously knowing about this bug for 1-2 months, tried to cover it up, and let the bug be abused in the meantime?
Meanwhile the people knowing about this bug or accidently making use of it have been making a shitlot of profit, which means losses for the exchange. These losses are going to have to be paid for. I somehow doubt the site admin is going to be able to pay for everything by himself, meaning he's been fucking around with our funds the last 2 months.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:07:16
EDIT: from the bitcoin-24 site:
Our Service is momentarily not available.
1. All funds (EUR, USD, PLN, GBP &amp; Bitcoins) are safe.
2. All withdrawals will be gradually processed chronologically from another bank account.
3. The Polish authority closed your Bank account in Poland.
4. Our lawyers are working with high pressure on a solution.
We will back with Bitcoin-24 2.0 on when all declarations are finished. 
EDIT 2, VERY IMPORTANT:

Not sure what your definition of market forces are, but a "DDOS" sure isn't in my vocabulary as a market force. It's an external force that caused the crash.
If mtgox gets hacked and all bitcoins are stolen, is it the bubble that popped or is it an external force that caused the crash?
See the difference? It ain't that hard.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:01:58
Yeah.. They know which account causes this and they could also increase the minimum amount of bitcoins tradable to a point where having a bot like this would cause extreme losses
@_date: 2013-04-13 10:20:35
Can we please get to business here instead of comparing with mtGox? What implication do you think this new gained information has?
There could have been people [ACTIVELY abusing this bug and making profit in the form of bitcoins from making these double transaction]( They obtained double or more the amount of bitcoins from the same amount of money. These bitcoins have been withdrawn from the site to other wallets during the last two months, and are thus gone, meaning this is an irreversible loss for the site. These losses are going to have to be paid for.
This source shows us that the owner has actually been aware of this bug for a MONTH but tried to cover it up. Meanwhile his exchange has most likely been making a ton of losses. Once again, these losses are going to have to be paid for.
So, coming back to the statement on the bitcoin-24 site, that "all funds are safe". This is only possible IF and only IF every single loss the site has made due to the bug, can be covered by the owner himself through his own reserve of bitcoins and money. If he cannot cover all losses by himself, this inherently means the users of the site will have to pay for the losses (including me). This lost money isn't going to come flying out of thin air.
Anyone with a fair amount of bitcoins knowing about this bug could've been making maybe a billion by now  How much funds do you think there will be left for us?
