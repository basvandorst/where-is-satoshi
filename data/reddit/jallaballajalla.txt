Reported for selling fake bitcoins.

I used to think this was gonna happen, but now that John says it im suddenly very sceptical. We're probably about to crash.

Send me 1 and I'll believe you.

Blame canada. Or immigrants.

Your name and sceptisism is very suitable for this coin. I was in ico and it was just a mess. Changed the rules of ico two days before it ended because it didnt sell, banned members asking critical questions on telegram, didn't have their numbers right, claimed 5% bounty when it was in fact 10% +++
This is indeed a shit coin from a shit team and im never touching it again. Pretty sure they spend more time shilling than building a product.

Iota. IF they ever get out of beta and are able to turn off the coordinator.

To me, 100 bucks a piece :)

Im in Norway, been thinking a while of getting ibto mining but been buying cc instead. How much is the electricity in Germany?

I love this post !

I think about 0.12-0.15$ in the winter and maybe half in the summer.

Why get rid of them so quickly? Just mine and it'll be more profitable again soon. Where are you located?
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:52:42
Only in hodling so far, but i want to get into mining. Very curious about the iota computing power stuff too.
