I like the idea of digital tokens for companies.  Now when they get hacked, we can short the shit out of their coin, instead of bitcoin. You could also potentially hedge your own exposure on their exchange.

Nope, that's not the purpose of bitcoin.   We should not have to trust these people ever again.  Even if 20k nodes exist, I should always have a choice to run a node on my home computer.    It's kind of like the 2nd amendment.

Core developers are a solid group of well known cypherpunks who have a solid road map that ensures Bitcoin's fungibility is maximized.   They basically figured out a way to have their cake, eat it too and give the man the middle finger.  
Fungibility is the hardest challenge because you have to keep level 1 bitcoin small and then setup hooks for level2.   What isn't cypherpunk about that???

No one is going to switch to classic because fees go up.    Everyone with half a brain has figured out that full blocks is the eventual norm no matter how big they are.   When taking that into account, the obvious choice is to develop a fully featured fee market now.  
Fee surges are only painful today because our wallets suck.  They all need dynamic fees and automatic replace-by-fee.  Once that is fixed, we'll begin to see a very interesting fee dynamic where they react to block frequency and backlog.

Just for a little price action historical context, prior to the 2013 mega bubble, Silk Road was shut down at the end of September 2013.  Everyone thought bitcoin was over, because the biggest darkmarket was raided.  This was after a sustained quiet period post $266 bubble. 
Price dropped ~35% after SR1, then popped back up to run for new highs.     
The recent FUD and price action suggests that something similar may trigger the next mega rally.  BTFD!

My question is: what the fuck is wrong with the world?  
This private company is trying to create the ultimate spying tool for crypto currencies.  Honestly, it's a great business model in this day and age, that's sad!   
Free markets are meant to be free from regulations and rules.  Creating whitelists allows a complete 100% control of your economic choice and freedom!  
They'll be able to declare where you can spend your money and who can pay you.   This is every governments wet dream.
Maybe this system would be great if we controlled our politicians, but we all agree that we don't trust them.  Just look at our candidates today. All shit!
My only suggestion to ChainAnchor is to attach that "thing" to the education and government systems first.   Lets put the chains on the cronies and see how well it works.  
I want to know where all of our tax dollars are going!  Once we know, we can create whitelists for approved expenditures and blacklists for the crap we want to get rid of.     Perfect!

That's a far off mental price barrier.   It's possible, but not likely to happen unless the perfect storm arises. 
We would need an economic panic.  If the banks can't keep their shit together, bitcoin is the perfect escape from that system.  
The longer Bitcoin survives, the more strain it will place on the existing economic system.    $10,000 isn't an "if it will happen", it's a "when will it happen".

I remember Wright mentioning something about "continents".  I assume that he was introducing latency based on geographical distribution of nodes.  The only part that worried me was that it was between ~1k nodes.   Is that enough?  The whole decentralization argument at all costs is something that you and your boys introduced.
What happens when your idea of what bitcoin is supposed to be, ends up being challenged by the alleged creator?  What if you don't agree and your developer "consensus" has essentially high-jacked his creation and turned in into your own?  I find that pretty interesting.  
Especially with Wright dropping hints that bitcoin should be much more and talking about more op-codes and a secondary stack.    Maybe you guys will just ignore him, since he hasn't proven himself to be Satoshi yet, but what happens if he does?  
Would you still ignore him?

Unless these computers are &gt; 51% of the hashpower.. then we have a problem, because building a quantum computer is a few degrees more difficult than an ASIC.   Which means more centralization around those who can build these machines.

That's their prerogative.  They can also pick any arbitrary fee they want.  $13.37 per transaction or we'll keep publishing empty blocks!   
So we don't need small blocks to create a fee market.  Miners just need to flex a little muscle.

True, it's sounds like the owners have to be known and it's going to be part of the T0 system to keep track of them.   So maybe you download a T0 app and that allows you to purchase digital securities.  It's not truely open yet like colored coins, but it's not too far off either.

Why don't you turn some other coin in this settlement network that you want so much?  You can pick any other blockchain with a low marketcap to do settlement on.  
As far as I can tell, most people want Satoshi's vision of Bitcoin, which mentions 1GB blocks.  That might not be possible, but it does mean that we should work towards scaling up with larger blocks, not down.

How much is a SETLcoin worth?  If it doesn't have market value, then it has to be backed by something or someone, which introduces counterparty risk.  Bitcoin isn't backed by anything per say, however it is currently worth about $380 a coin depending on liquidity.  That's the advantage that bitcoin has over these private blockchain coins.  
It sounds like SETLcoin is a GS IOU.  
The best way that these banks can swap assets is for each bank to create digital shares of their corporate stock and use those as IOUs for various other purchases.  As least those would have a relative market value.  
@_date: 2015-12-15 20:23:51
Oh no!! What are we going to do without a Bitcoin CEO?
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:34:02
Sure it does.  
But why does "currency" need to maintain some particular value?  What if we just had a price index which all prices were based off of?  So instead of seeing a price tag that says $1 USD, it's 1 PI or one indexed price unit.  No one would own these price units, because it's just an index based on various commodities.  Instead, we only use it as a point of reference.  Our smart phones can do the conversion from BTC to PI and then the receiver on the other end can get any unit they desire.  BTC, LTC, Apple stock, etc. 
Basically what Shapeshift is doing.
I think we've conflated the idea that "currency" must be both a medium of exchange and a unit of account.  It makes life much easier when you're using cash, but once everything goes digital, there no reason why we won't be able to exchange anything and everything.  (sans government control)
You'll get paid 50 PI of value, but that value is instantly converted into something else that you actually want.  It could be crypto-currency, stocks, bonds, whatever.  All assets should be liquid.
 
@_date: 2015-12-07 03:35:01
So SETLcoin is like Ripple's XRP?  It's not meant to have nominal value, it's just a transport token ?   In that case their blockchain is just a ledger of assets.  yawn.

I can't know for certain, but I've followed this entire movement from the start and the big blockers are fucking idiots.  They're so anti-bitcoin and don't even know it.  


I used to think big blocks and a hardfork were the natural path forward. I even thought Gavin was competent.   I changed my mind after I saw the fuckery behind XT and the sock puppetry behind the big block movement.   It's all a scammy smoke screen and they lie and cheat anyway they can to fake support.   I hate those idiots with a passion now, because I used to be one of them, but I wised up.  I learned why decentralization is so damn important and it's the key to bitcoins success.      
These kids that say bitcoin is p2p cash and must have low fees are completely missing the big invention that bitcoin is and it can only be maintained with extreme decentralizatoin.   We can't risk giving miners control of the blocksize, we shouldn't risk hardforks, and we shouldn't bother with these alternative consensus clients.  It's a waste of time and energy.

The longest chain doesn't suddenly become valid at some stage if it's breaking the rules.   Except in BU land.
The current consensus and XBT exchange order books are connected.  
If hashpower takes over and forks, the current order book doesn't magically move to the new fork.   The fork is essentially starting from scratch, with an empty orderbook that its supporters need to fill it so the miners can sell their coins.   If miners don't have buyers, then they're just wasting money.

If they follow the same logic in the event of a BU fork, then you can bet BU will be the fork, and XBT will remain unchanged.  Thus the ETF will still track XBT, not switch to BU.

I suppose you are correct.  Spammers will simply fill up the memory pool at a specific fee range, but normal users can always pay a little bit more to jump in front of them.  However, miners could also be the spammers and purposefully fill up majority of the blocks with junk, and force users to pay more for priority.

If you remove the monopoly on force, from the tax funded police in your area, you will have gangs spring up in a matter of weeks.   The rich will hire their own security to protect their wealth from vandals and gangs.   But this just creates goals in the eyes of the gangs, for they will dream of eventually overcome the rich peoples security and seize control.  Look at Mexico.
There is a very natural progression of force that occurs if you don't have a countering force that is larger than all the rest put together.

It's meant to socialize the cost of mining and give each device access to the blockchain and micropayments.   It's not meant for you to get rich off mining.
EDIT:   
21Inc is jumping to the mining endgame.   The block reward was meant to be a bootstrapping mechanism and it's unclear if fees will cover the costs to adequately secure Bitcoin.   So the only way to have a strong network of computers securing the blockchain is to socialize the cost in some way.  
Many think this should be done via inflation that gets paid to miners, but that completely undermines the principles Bitcoin was founded on.  Plus inflation hurts everyone holding/using bitcoin regardless of wealth (regressive).  However, with micro miners, the affluent that have tons of electronic devices will be the ones paying for the network.  
If you want to checkout of the system and cut your costs, get rid of your micro miners.   Contrast this choice with monetary inflation, which is inescapable, and it's obvious which system is better.
21Inc is ensuring 21M coins is all there ever will be.   Get yours today. LOL.

@_date: 2016-03-13 21:34:59


In case you haven't noticed Bitcoin doesn't have traffic problems like LA. We're going to start with zero payment channels and slowly ramp up.  You can open 50 channels today, just for the fuck of it.  It's not like everyone is restricted to 1 channel a year on day one.  It's takes time to see how the usage plays out.  So bitching about how channels may or may not work in 5 years is completely idiotic.  


Do you own bitcoin?  If so, how long have you been holding them?
Personally, I have coins that haven't moved in years.   I don't buy and sell coins every time the price moves, so this volatility argument makes no sense to the folks that own the 15 million coins in existence.. Plus, only maybe a million trade hands each month.  The rest are just parked.   That's a lot of potential liquidity that could be moved into LN.


Opening a channel is kind of like budgeting.  How much do you spend on coffee each month, or groceries?   Again, assuming 1 channel a year is idiotic.   Channels will be opened/closed a lot more frequently until the liquidity hubs grow to a decent size.   It's not something that happens over night, but slowly more coins will get locked up and velocity will increase.


Sure, but there are thousands of coffee shops and chains around the globe that have different ideals and philosophies on life.  I'm sure someone can bring together a consortium of java places that are willing to accept bitcoins via payment channels.   It's essentially just like pre-paid cards.  It's not a big deal and there's zero risk to them.

It's still the same result.  RBF doesn't enable or disable double spends.  Anyone can double spend their tx, until it's in a block.   
It's just a formal policy that acknowledges that double spends are useful for fixing transactions for various reasons.  
That's it.  
Removing RBF from Classic proves that their devs do no know what they are doing and the "community" doesn't understand Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-02-09 00:46:07
I partially disagree.  Nodes do matter.  Mining doesn't matter if you don't have people willing to buy your coins today...unless we time travel back to 2010 when all users were also miners.
So in today's climate, users != miners, therefore it's up to the hodlers to buy coins off the miners and they will only buy these coins if they are creating valid blocks according to all the nodes that exchanges, businesses and users run.      
Miners are part of the system and they provide a service, that can be swapped out at anytime with a different algorithm as long as the economic majority agrees.  They are expendable.

Why isn't litecoin humming with activity then?    It's faster than Bitcoin with plenty of free capacity.

BU is not just a blocksize increase.  It creates a game where nodes get to broadcast what they're willing to accept, which can be faked, and miners taking a stab in the dark if they should create a larger block or not.  The moment they do,  nodes who aren't ready will be ejected from the network without warning.  It's a cluster fuck of bad design ideas all wrapped in a soggy napkin and with some chicken scratches about blockstream core killing beavers for their pelts.

Look at this map
Isn't pretty obvious where Bitcoin has spread to?    If you see 100 nodes in Florida, could you extrapolate that bitcoin has a stronger presence than in Johannesburg which has 3 nodes?  
Now, if you're in Johannesburg trying to get others into bitcoin and pull up this map and see 50 nodes, wouldn't that help sell bitcoin as being a viable digital currency and that they could trust it?  
Money is all about trust. Having strong network effects and nodes local to new communities helps make this crazy internet money a little more real.    
Nodes might not help the network process more transactions, but it does strengthen the global consensus and the perception that Bitcoin isn't going to disappear tomorrow.

@_date: 2015-01-13 06:51:50
Ah, so the troll decided to raise the bar.
Value is created by reducing friction between two parties.  Bitcoin is built for this use case, so it is impossible to argue that it doesn't create economic value.  Any two people on the internet can now exchange value in seconds, for any amount and no one can stop it.    Beat that!  


Those are scams and immature companies that are failing because they over estimated the market or don't know how to run a business.  This happens in every new market.  For example US shale gas oil rigs are going broke in North Dakota right now because they over estimated the market and the price of oil is dropping.  
It's the same shit. 
Bitcoin is not special.  Boom and bust cycles happen.   Dotcom bubble, gave birth to the modern internet that we all love today.   Bitcoin is giving birth to global value transfer and programmable money.  This ecosystem is still in the early phases and bootstrapping.   We're just scratching the surface of what is possible.  
The funny thing is that you trolls are going to have to keep this up, year after year after year, because this technology can not be uninvited.   It's not going away because it actually provides real utility and value.

Your faith in the system is your folly.  Faith in a system(religion) that has proven to collapse time and time again.  Maybe instead of trolling reddit, you should read a history book.  
It's really hilarious how think they're the informed and smart ones, but are in fact idiots who can't see the forest from the trees.  It's like you think bitcoin is static and can't change and adapt to meet the challenges.  You see MtGox and you think every other exchange is going to be a Gox. It's hilarious how short sighted your guys are.  The world is changing right out from under you.
The invention of bitcoin got a lot of people thinking about what the world would look like without State "backed" fiats.   Of course we're still in the day dreaming stage, we all know that.  But the fact is that decentralized blockchain technology is the only thing that can challenge the current State+Bank system.  Money and State should be separated and Bitcoin "might" be the next system.  That's why we're going bat shit insane talking about it.  It's potentially revolutionary.
Your rebuttal will probably be something along the lines of: never gonna happen b/c of scalability, insecure computers, volatility, which are legit concerns today, but are all being worked out.  These issues are not insurmountable and there are very smart **engineers** all around the world working on them.

Really, once you understand the dynamics of Bitcoin, it becomes pretty obvious that a contentious hardfork is pretty much impossible.

Fixed supply is Bitcoins best feature and is the only reason we're talking about this technology in the first place. If Bitcoin didn't have that, then some other altcoin would have.  
Lets say the inflation rate of Bitcoin was 5% forever,  would you put money into it to "invest" over the next 5-10 years to bootstrap the technology?  Hell no.   Limited supply means that speculators can buy a percent of the overall tokens for good.  It is like owning part of a startup.    AKA Bootstrapping.   Without bootstrapping, Bitcoin would have failed long ago.
Of course, fixed supply will result in volatility, but this can be solved by using swaps, hedges, and etfs.  All of these instruments are in the works.  


Proof of Work is the only trustless solution. POS requires checkpoints and staking of coins.   Who creates the checkpoints?   Who do you trust?  
Yes, POW, burns electricity, but think about all the energy and manpower that goes into our banking systems to provide trust and consensus.   And even with all of that energy, it still only takes a few keystrokes for them to create more coin and depreciate everyones holdings.  How fair is that?  Honestly, I don't buy into that system any longer, it makes no sense.


There are several arguments that say that this is not true.  ( I don't have the time to dig them up right now, but google around and you'll find them)  There is also DPOS(bitshares) which is interesting and they claim that their consensus algorithm is better by being more distributed.  But again, do you trust Bitshares?  They are a for profit company running their own chain with their own agenda.


I guess this is the prime disagreement.  What you guys see these as flaws, supporters see as being revolutionary features.
Fixed supply, in a world of endless money printing, creates a huge value proposition for bitcoin.  POW means that we don't have to trust anyone.
Ripple and Stellar for example have amazingly efficient consensus algorithms, but they control the network and own majority of their tokens.  Do you trust Ripple or Stellar to be at the center of the crypto currency market?   I sure as hell don't.  
Who do you trust to be at the helm of your financial system? Especially now that you actually have a choice.  I choose Bitcoin over all other coins because of network effects! ATMs, exchanges, stores, websites, services, etc and it's still growing.
HOWEVER, I think the price is going to continue downwards over the next 6 months.  The 1200 bubble was insanity and after any bubble, there is a crash with many casualties. 
Those are my views.  You are free to disagree, but don't shit all over simply because you disagree with it.   Stay in with your circlejerk of pointlessness.  We're busy creating a new financial system on top of the internet.

Do you have express lanes where you live?   I do.  You simply pull into the lane and then it bills you for using the faster route.
The reason it works, is because it separates those who are in a hurry and willing to pay for the express, vs sit in traffic for the next hour.   Bitcoin has an infinite number of express lanes.   If the 10 cent lane is full, then I can jump to the 15 cent lane, if that lane is full, then I can jump to the 50 cent lane and so on.   I can ALWAYS get into the next block if I pay high enough fee, thanks to RBF!  Other folks are willing to wait longer, so they will pay an lower fee.   That's the market... and it works.
21.co illustrates this perfectly here. 
As the lanes become congested, we move to the next lane until we reach a point where we're no longer willing to pay the fee for this particular use case.    If I spend bitcoin on a regular basis, then I can make that calculation and determine when I should be using channels, instead of on-chain transactions.
If my wallet has LN, then why not lock a portion of my funds into a channel for when I want to buy something?   


This is so moronic.  If I lock $100 into a channel and the price changes 20%,  then I either have $120 or $80 to spend.  Such is life in bitcoinland.    It's not like you lock in precisely $125.80 for the next 3 weeks of coffee and if the price changes more than 5% your life is over.    It is irrelevant.  Plus you're not required to empty the channel, they're refundable by default.
Any way, I'm done with this conversation.

Because you're simply wrong.  If you're advocating hardforking for any reason other than critical security related issues, then we will laugh at you.

That's exactly the issue with BU.  Even though a node signals it supports bigger blocks through user agent strings there is no way to know unless you create a bigger block to test it.   Miners essentially have to waste money testing it.   Sybil attacks 101.

Blocks aren't full.


How do we get from a bitcoin where I can send as many transactions as I want TODAY, provided I pay a &lt; 10 cent fee, to only being able to transact twice a year?
Please extrapolate how that happens and how LN isn't going to become wildly popular on the way.
That's your fail scenario, how can you support it with a valid argument?


Price volatility!   If you don't plan on selling within the next few years, then it is of no concern.  


THEY(businesses) don't have to lock up funds!  The hubs and users do, UNLESS the business pays out bitcoin to someone else.   Then they could open a channel going back out to a hub and help with re-balancing.
Look at slide 10.  Alice pays Dave.  Dave doesn't have to have any funds locked up.
In addition, Bitpay or Coinbase could offer a LN wallet for the merchants it supports.

I completely disagree that 32MB is worth the risk.  That means only 1st world countries can run nodes.    I'm not even sure if Australia and NZ could keep up at that point.   Bitcoin would likely centralize around North America, Europe and Asia.  Which by the way, already have established financial systems that are better than bitcoin in most facets.   It wouldn't be until the BRICS finish their own fiber backbones before they could run nodes and participate.  That doesn't seem fair.

Zero-Conf always exists.. in fact, we can't remove it.    You can always ignore the flags and record in your dumb ledger that a transaction was sent to you as soon as hits the mempool.  There's nothing stopping you from being ignorant about the risks of zero-conf.

It's not purely about who can use bitcoin... it's about trusting Bitcoin.   
High bandwidth/hardware requirements mean that only people in 1st world countries can run nodes.  When you run a node, you validate the consensus and ensure that everyone is following the rules.   If you're in a 2nd,3rd world country, but can not participate in that validation then is it really your money?  Would you trust it?  Money is all about trust.
If nodes have low requirements then nearly anyone in the world with broadband internet can run a consensus enforcing node.  That means they no longer have to trust some wallet or other service that's hosted in the 1st world. 
IMO, we need nodes all over the world because they symbolize decentralized trust and enforcement of the consensus.   If we have folks in each country that run nodes and can explain what it means to enforce the rules of global internet money, then that's really powerful.  Especially in countries like Venezuela. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 20:56:20


Sure, but we probably won't reach that level of use for another few years.  As fees increase, more usage will naturally move to LN because it's cheaper and faster.
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:19:58


Nothing happens until the miners try creating a block larger than 1MB.   Once that happens, they will fork and take everyone that is running a BU node with them.  The rest of the Bitcoin network will also ban those nodes for relaying invalid blocks.

I provided you the slides link, because I just came across it the other day and thought it was helpful.  They also talk about using LN to swap coins between sidechains, which is an use case I doubt many are aware of.

Anyone who has done their homework agrees that raising the blocksize via a hardfork is dangerous, but the Classic team + is running a giant FUD campaign against Core to try and make it happen regardless.
As we speak Classic is adding attack vectors to their code, because they don't fully grasp the complexity of bitcoin.
Their commit history shows one guy hacking around the codebase, while Gavin chimes in with gems like "I like simple".
They're also removing RBF, because they naively think that they can grow the blocksize limit to fit everyone's transactions in the next block forever.

I agree,  but they have a specific vision.  One that they believe will setup the dynamics for bitcoin to survive at least for the next 150 years.   Miners happen to run their software because they agree with that vision and as you pointed out, they are obviously competent.   I think that factor outweights all else... to the point where Core doesn't need to compromise.   They are engineers who know better than anyone else what holds bitcoin together.     If miners want to run some other shitty software, then nothing is stopping them.  If they want to try their luck with the market and hardfork, nothing is stopping them.   Bitcoin Core has certain principles and I doubt it involves building sub-par software due to politics and egos.


You're talking about BU developers and their cesspool sub right?
I can't even tell anymore.   But either way, fuck BU.  Worst bullshit ideas to ever come out of bitcoin.  Political voting for the blocksize is the stupidest idea ever.   It should be programmatic and hands off.   Everything else is gameable, drama, bullshit.

However, BU supporters think there is a third option.    They think that there is a possibility that exchanges are going to replace XBT with BU.

The reality is that Classic is trying to activate at 75%.  So it is not a clean shift to a new route, they are planning on splitting the road with a contentious change.  That's the big issue and why this particular hardfork is dangerous.  
Core doesn't need to use such dirty tactics because they are acting within the current consensus.  Their implementation of segwit doesn't ask the network to pick a side or risk being abandoned.   They are rolling out useful upgrades in a responsible manner.    
If we were OK with hardforks, then why don't we switch to Blockstream's [Elements Alpha](  It has way better features than the current version of Bitcoin.    If Blockstream took a similar approach as Classic, they would trying to convince everyone to hardfork to Elements Alpha right now and abandon Core. 
But they are not doing that, because they respect the established Bitcoin consensus.

Blocks only mode that was introduced in 0.12.0 is probably the best option for wallet nodes.    Thin blocks is more for miners, but even then the relay network works better.
I don't normally argue about explicit numbers, it's more about the trend.  
Are we pushing bitcoin to become more centralized or decentralized? 
The other big issue with the 2MB bump is the required hardfork to do it. We'll likely leave behind a lot of the nodes on this map.  Which hurts decentralization.

Bitcoin is still growing, exchange volume is increasing, LocalBitcoins is increasing.  Apps, libraries, and layer 2 systems will enable the next wave of adoption to occur without sacrificing decentralization.
We have the best chance of existing in 20 years and still being decentralized.   Something that will be impossible for majority of altcoins to pull off.   Time and immutability is on our side.

I don't think we have to do anything but sit and watch.   as soon as BU forks off and is listed on exchanges, it opens up the ability for you to sell those coins..  BUT who are the buyers?
The BU order books will be virtually empty unless Roger Ver plans on putting a floor in his market and buying all the coins people are selling.  In which case, Roger, rbtc and some miners in China will be the sole owners of all the BU coins and they would have sold all of their Bitcoin in exchange for it.
Good riddance at that point.   BU supporters sell BTC,. BTC supporters sell BU.   Equilibrium will be reached, and my bet is that Bitcoin will have a far higher market cap when the dust settles and BU coin won't be able to support the amount of hashpower that's running on it.  
Miners will then switch back to Bitcoin because it's more profitable and BU withers and dies along will its plague of big block supporters.

It hurts everyone who doesn't upgrade.  It makes running a node more expensive, especially in places like Venezuela.  It allows for more spam transactions and dick pics to be saved into the blockchain for eternity.  It allows wallets to drag their feet longer and not calculate fees correctly.   It allows apps like DropZone to store their product catalog in the blockchain because it remains cheap. Coinbase sends 2 transactions for each withdraw for the lolz (tracking).    
All of this shit is garbage and needs to be priced out ASAP. 
Fees must go up and kill off these wasteful uses of a public utility.  Ever heard of Tragedy of the Commons?   90% of transactions that occur today, should be flowing through non-persistent channels.   No one is treating Bitcoin as the limited resource it is.  
Raising the blocksize today, is like revealing pocket Ace's before the flop.  It's premature.  The game is just beginning, hold off, build the extensibility hooks, make things more efficient, get L2 solutions working and then re-evaluation where we stand.

There is zero economic transactions occurring on the BU fork.  Zero.   And it will stay that way until the the fork is 100% resolved.   If anyone accepts coins on the BU fork before Core is 100% dead, they will end up losing coins because BU will reorg when Core creates the longest chain again.    If BU fixes that issue, then BU can survive on its own after the fork. 
Until then, it is far too risky for any serious business to accept any BU coins.

Everyone has to answer that for themselves.   Majority of people don't trust Bitcoin... they think it's crazy internet money and there's nothing stopping the man behind the curtain from stealing or printing more coins.   What about Gox?  etc..  
I've heard these arguments several times and the only way to refute it is to say that they can run their own node that validates the transactions.  People usually say "Oh, that's cool".   
Yes, it is cool.  Nodes are your chance to vote and ensure your money isn't being subverted.   Sadly, not everyone appreciates this feature.


Maybe, but it's all about ones comfort level with the protocol. 


If you can only run them in data centers in said country, then the government can easily shut them down.  Also how much more expensive is it to run a node in a datacenter vs at home?
Whenever I look at that bitnodes map, I think about all the places that should have nodes, but probably can't because they don't have the bandwidth and/or don't even know that there is an alternative to fiat.   
It's a long process to get people to trust digital money, but I think running a node helps alleviate some concerns.

When you send a transactions across bitcoin how much utility is that worth to you?    If you send $1, to buy a gumball how much is that utility worth?   If I send $10,000 from Europe to the US, how much is that worth?   
The fee is essentially how much you are willing to pay to use the network for your particular use case.  If fees raise to 10 cents, and you stop using Bitcoin, then that's how much you value it.  That's how much utility Bitcoin is providing you.    
So what is spam?   It's the stuff that gets price out of the market because users aren't willing to pay for that utility any longer.    
People are storing gobs of text in the blockchain, for the LOLZ.   If you're doing shit on the blockchain for the LOLZ, it's probably spam.
Take email for example.  It's essentially free to send an email and my mailbox is filled with spam. There are entire companies based on filtering spam.  That's how much of a problem it becomes if something is free.    Once it costs something, spam will be dramatically reduced and only the more valuable use cases are left.
Blockchains have an immense cost to confirm a transaction and store it for eternity... Fees must go up, so that only the really valuable use cases are left.   
Everything else can be pushed into payment channels.

Because the system has become increasingly centralized.  Keeping node requirements low ensures that miners+exchanges are not changing the rules out from under us. 
In addition, the great firewall of china posses a real treat of fracturing bitcoin into two if the bandwidth requires increase too much.   China miners together can mine more blocks than everyone else.. and if their blocks take longer to get past the firewall, then they'll have lead time to start on the next block.  The rest of the world is at a disadvantage.  That effect grows as bandwidth requirements increase.

The cards have been dealt.   Buy some popcorn and place your bets.


Which requires a consensus breaking change and a hardfork which will abandon thousands of old nodes. 
I disagree.  Hardforking for a single change like increasing the blocksize is a waste and sets us up for future consensus attacks.

Fine, lets talk about it!
This is a huge red flag.  
We should never let the miners pull a political stunt like this and allow them to highjack the network.  I can guarantee this attempt will fail just like the last. But it's scary that more people don't understand the precedent this would create and how it would undermine the integrity of Bitcoin, and being immutable digital gold.    
We, the hodlers, should always fight against the miners interests. 
If they got their way, they would process every transaction on-chain to make more money.  If fact, they should be staunchly opposed to all off-chain solutions.   Does that narrative sound familiar??   It's the main talking point of r/btc!      Of course they want to get rid of the nasty "performance bottle neck", because it's a cap on their revenues.    The blocksize limit should be renamed to something like the: network throttle, decentralization knob, or mining revenue ceiling. 
If I was a miner, I would always strive to grow MY transaction processing capacity, because it puts pressure on everyone else in the network to keep up.  The bigger I get, the higher percentage of transactions I can process and the harder it is for competitors.   Bitcoin Classic is trying to start slow, with 2MB, while Bitcoin Unlimited just wants to hand over the network to miners and big exchanges and let them decide.    
You can bet they will attempt to build the next Visa, and subsequently control the inflation schedule.
I vote NO to all hardfork attempts, especially by miners and moon kids!

@_date: 2016-06-15 21:42:56
First off, I don't think we're experiencing a high amount of load.  Fees are still very low.  If this is high load, and if people always bitch at 20 cent fees, then bitcoin is fucked.   
If miners have control of their supply function, then it means they have to deal with political pressure to raise the blocksize every time fees increase a little bit.  This always resorts in another blocksize increase,  until they become the next global Visa.  Only thing standing in their way, is peskey decentralization, which naturally decreases as bandwidth requirements are increased.
To answer your questions:  
1. If miners ran bitcoin unlimited, then the first case is inevitable over enough time.  
2.  We are reaching optimal load.  The fees will determine what people are willing to pay for bitcoin, so there's no reason to be afraid of what is happening right now.      The biggest issue is that wallets fee estimation suck.  But I'm sure anyone who is moving old coins, trying to take profit, has no problem paying 50 cents to do it.

You're trying to inject nuance where there is none.   There are two reasonable options.
1.  Ignore Bu when it forks which would piss off customers who may want to  sell/buy BU tokens.
2. list BU when it forks as a new asset (altcoin).  allowing people to trade it freely.
However, BU supporters think there is a third option.    They think that there is a possibility that exchanges are going to replace XBT with BU.
The responses from the exchanges clear up that misconception and make it very clear, BU will be added as an altcoin.

That's interesting.  I'm probably completely biased, but I see Bitcoin from the "why"-&gt;"how"-&gt;"what" perspective,  verses Eth as the inverse.   It's probably just years of conditioning and hodling. 
Why Bitcoin?  Magic internet money, with fixed inflation schedule.
How?  Decentralized blockchain
What?   BFD and hold.
This goes even deeper to the big block crowd who think that if only the blocks were bigger people would come.  But that's catering to the what-&gt;how-&gt;why paradigm, which has limited success.
Bitcoin much stronger if people understand WHY bitcoin in the first place.  Satoshi even added a hint to the "why" in genesis block.

Ethereum is naive if it thinks it can transcend the shit storm that will rain down on them once they disrupt a real industry and the media starts to call them out for all their imperfections, hacks, disputes, challenges and how crazy your fundamental principles are that drive the little ecosystem.   Just wait until the lawsuits pile up and Vitalik disapears into the night like Satoshi did.  Think about how many illegal dapps are running on ethereum.

Exactly.  Eth is now caught between a rock and a hardplace.  
Either they bail out TheDAO, and demonstrate that their contracts are not trustless and can be overruled by humans, OR they let the hacker win, BUT he'll now own roughly 4% of Eth, which screws with their plans to switch to PoS.
They have 27 days to decide.  Let's see how they handle a contentious hard/soft fork.

1. None if this matters.  What we really want is a capacity increase, why are we sitting around debating HOW it should be done? &gt; 90% of the folks here don't understand the code and what sort of ramifications this change will have on propagation and consensus convergence.  Let the Core developers do their jobs.  They have gotten us this far and they have a pretty amazing roadmap layed out that gives us more than enough ways to scale bitcoin.
2. Yes, there is a substantial change with full blocks, but it's a really important test.  It's showing that people actually value bitcoin and will pay to use it.  If we see fees rise to $1 or $5 or whatever, it means that Bitcoin is providing real utility and not just a gimmick.  Another thing to consider, is that if bitcoin is as successful as we think it will be, then full blocks will be the natural state of the network, regardless of blocksize.  
3. I've been paying attention to the tx backlogs lately we are not in some emergency scenario.  We have surges and lulls as expected.   We're not going to be overcome by a "cheaper" coin in a matter of months or even years.  I trade Forex and my broker just added Bitcoin in the past year and I doubt they'll swap it out for an altcoin because the fee increased to 50 cents.  Get real.    
Bitcoin has had so many competitors over the years, I don't see how people still think a coin is going to pop up overnight and dethrone Bitcoin because fees temporarily rise to 50 cents during surges.     Especially when you consider the mindshare, value proposition, global integration, trading derivatives, market depth, and our technical roadmap.    Ethereum's hack shows that it's not all roses over their either.

The unbanked are playing video games on their PC?   How did they get Bitcoin in the first place?  Why would .20 cent fee be a big deal?  


I don't know.  And that's my point.  It's up the market to decide, but I can guarantee high value transactions will always trump low value ones.  Trying to ensure that fees stay below a certain threshold is very centralizing and can be gamed.


What you need to realize is that Bitcoin is serving a market that is bigger than you.  It's bigger than your game purchases, it's bigger than your coffee transactions, it bigger than your tips to someone who made you LOL.  
Bitcoin allows fortunes to travel the world and there is no way your little transactions can ever compete for that onchain space, regardless of blocksize.   
Once LN activates, you can lock $40 into your wallet and play satoshis slots all day, then buy a steam game with your winnings, without hitting the blockchain and waiting for fickle confirmations.   
Offchain LN wallets are going to 1000x better than your current bitcoin experience.  It just takes a little  time to ramp up.  
Be patient!


Fuck the miners.  They are too centralized and too greedy.  If they want a piece of the LN action, they can run a hub just like everyone else.

Everyone needs to realize that hardforking to fix the protocol is 100% different than hardforking to revert the actions of a dapp.
TheDAO is not Ethereum, ethereum is not broken, so why should it fork to roll-back a rogue app?   Bitcoin has never hardforked to return money, even after the numerous hacks that have occured.    Why hasn't bitcoin done that?  Because it breaks the social contract of neutrality.
By saying the community can roll back transactions on Ethereum, means that the blockchain is not neutral and their contracts are not an arbiter of truth.  Ethereum loses all credibility, and becomes a community of fundamentalists that have their own overriding culture of norms beyond the evaluation of code.

The only disruption is coming from your little crew in rbtc that likes to promote that narrative.  I actually use bitcoin it works identical to the way it behaved in the past.  Confirmations are fickle by nature.


Read the developers correspondence.  They've provided plenty of evidence over the years. 


All of their chatter is in public domain.  Moron!  How old are you?  Do you know how to internet ?


Everything that is remote interesting can be added to bitcoin at some point.  There is no reason to believe that some coin is going to keep its innovation locked in their weak chain unable to be copied and applied to bitcoin.   Altcoins are just test beds for ideas, that will eventually come to bitcoin.   WHY?  Because Bitcoin is the monetary base for all of crypto.  It's the hard money platform.  Everything else is less important.

Solid post! 
It doesn't matter if the reality is that no one bought bitcoin during Grexit, what matters is that a narrative is being formed. Same with Brexit, same with every economic event that occurs.  Markets are just humans trying to predict the future and the rumor mill and narratives drive majority of it.  GBP should not have dropped 1500 pips in a few hours, because materially, nothing is different in Britain. It will take months before a formal exit will occur, but that doesn't stop people from gambling on perceived risks and outcomes.   Same thing with bitcoin.  Zerohedge is building a strong narrative which trickles over into actual traders strategies.  It might be miniscule at this point, but it's growing and there's an unbelievable amount of money out there being thrown around since majority of the safe havens (bonds) are negative from QE programs chasing all the money out into the broader market.

Please do everyone a favor and change the narrative from "we want bigger blocks"  to "we want more transaction throughput".

Miners make more money with full blocks.  Look at the charts below.
As transactions fill up the mem-pool, folks over estimate the fees, because they're in a hurry.     The fees more than double for the miners when a little backlog occurs... so I doubt miners care about big blocks at this stage.  
IMO, Core is not crippling bitcoin... they're giving it super powers.   
CSV + SegWit, allows for many off chain solutions to develop.  Once those feature are in place, and LN boots up, we should see real trustless micropayments emerge.  Imagine tipping fractions of a penny, just like the dogecoin days, without having to worry about confirmations, or deal with 3rd parties like Changetip.  
Sure the development process takes time, but this software is complex and there's a lot of different features in flight at the same time.

Ever hear of something called the free-rider problem? Or tragedy of the commons? Blocksize prevents uneconomical use cases from free-loading on the global uncensorable storage chain, and forces people to pay for it instead.   You touched on some of the externalities, but brushed each of them off as if everyone in the world has your luxuries.
Also what about the fact that majority of hashpower is behind the great firewall of china and any additional latency or bandwidth could allow them to essentially run away with bitcoin? 
Also, digital gold is more important to the world than digital cash at this stage.  It doesn't matter how large the blocks are, it won't fix the problems with zero-conf, transaction malleability, or allow 1 billion people to transact on-chain to buy their daily coffee.   
The consumer side of Bitcoin's value proposition is horrible and I doubt we'll ever see mass adoption on chain.  There's just too much technical overhead for the average Joe.    
Focus on what Bitcoin is already good at and increase that value proposition. Namely privacy, speculation, global value transfers, and regulatory arbitrage.   Trying to compete with Visa at this stage is putting the cart before the horse.

I just listened to the podcast.  Why do you focus on blocksize instead of transaction throughput?   
If we get more throughput using SegWit,  LN, and other ways, why do you keep beating the big blocks narrative?   You and Roger offer a pre-schoolers level of understanding when it comes to scaling.  It's increase the blocksize or nothing with you guys.  
Since you're not a programmer, why not change the narrative to transaction throughput, instead of harping on about something so technical and has many nuances? 
We have advances in the pipeline, but you and Roger didn't mention them once!
The closing comments of the podcast was "we're going to keep pushing for a blocksize increase"     when it should be  "we're pushing for more transaction throughput".

I watched a video on Li-Fi and quantum computing the other day and it's obvious this technology is only a year away according to Bitcoin should be ahead of the curve and plan for success, by removing all constraints from the bitcoin blockchain and run full throttle into the future without any regard for externalized costs to nodes.  
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:39:27


Because their ecosystems are tiny.  No one uses them so it's easy to get the 5 bag holders together to upgrade.  aka too centralized!


SegWit + Schnorr + MAST could get us pretty close to that without ever needing a hardfork and disrupting the ecosystem.  Core's plan is better than yours.  


Oh the Fidelity effect?   Holders are more valuable then spenders, so I can care less about growth opportunities that involve $5 purchases onchain.


0-conf is problematic regardless of blocksize. Everyone who has been in the bitcoin space knows this.  Why do you continue to prop up this bad idea?  The reason Steam changed to 1-conf is because it's easier to do that than deal with all the false purchases by script kiddies trying to get free games.   It's an obvious attack vector! 
Do you have a brain?  Do you know how to measure cost/benefit?

True, but if the Ethereum community chooses to hardfork to override this contract then where does it end? 
There's no way an insurance company, for example, will run contracts on this chain because it's not neutral.  There is a chance that the community will disagree and override it.   As a business, you can't take that chance.
If Ethereum sets this precedent, then they just added human judges to their system.

Roger, I was here over the entire debate and swung from being big blocker, to small blocker, and now a strong supporter of Core, because of the absolute garbage and lies that flows out of your sub.   You came to the debate late and now have the most uninformed, ridiculous and naive opinion in the industry.   The sooner you STFU, the sooner Bitcoin can continue on it's trajectory to digital gold.   Contentious hardforks are not part of the plan.  Competing dev teams, trying to hardfork the network into different directions is absolutely ridiculous for market stability, decentralization and ruins our chances at becoming digital gold.    
The people in your sub are a complete disgrace to " free and open discussions of opinions online".  Anything that doesn't fall inline with their narratives is downvoted until you're completely throttled from having a fair conversation.   All threads are shaped to fall inline with their ideals AND these ideas are completely counter to a censorship resistant payment network.  Handing over the blocksize to profit driven miners is the biggest conflict of interest to Bitcoin possible.   BU is absolutely bonkers! These alternative versions of Bitcoin that don't follow the consensus is completely counter productive and are technically altcoins.
Get lost Roger, you are bad for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-27 19:14:07
I read your entire argument and I'm not worried.  Bitcoin fundamentals are better than every altcoin, including, Ethereum because it's a simpler system, with a well establish value proposition.   Ethereum's hack and subsequent forks prove that the community is a liability to all contracts executing on their platform.  Imagine if Bitcoin had a precedent of rolling back transactions if the community deemed it necessary.    It would not be taken seriously.

I think it's because Bitcoin is already a success, and we can't handle the next wave of adoption onchain.   Even if we double or triple the onchain capacity, it's not going to give us the orders of magnitude more throughput we need to onboard the next 100 million people.  So we have to plan for a new paradigm and encourage offchain solutions to develop.  Once we have offchain solutions, we can onboard the next 100M without much issue.  The focus will be on improving those solutions, which can iterate freely within their respective networks.  LN, Thunder, etc.


Higher fees are actually a good thing.  It allows us to measure bitcoins utility.   If people are willing to pay $5 to transact onchain, then that means Bitcoin has real value and not just some gimmick.   It's a measure of inefficiency in the current financial system, that Bitcoin is routing around and it gives us a solid floor in the market.  We can calculate what Bitcoin, the network, is worth.  That is huge, especially when you think about Bitcoin being a safe haven.


The people that we want to invest and buy bitcoin at this stage, could not careless about the 50 cents fees of the network.  Like I said, they are bigger than all of your average joe transactions combined.  


What?  Anyone can be a LN node.  Miners, you, me, average Joe, whatever.  There isn't a barrier to entry and there are multiple implementations.


I came to my own conclusions, but it's pretty obvious, once you know the limits of onchain throughput and think about what is required for mass adoption.

As an investor in this space, I keep my ear to ground for all serious developments and possible threats, and nothing stands out as being a bitcoin killer.  Nothing is on the horizon.

If you spread your purchases out over time, then dollar cost averaging is easier because you can budget, say $100 a month to spend on the asset.   As the price dips, hits a bottom, then slowly crawls up, you'll end up with a perfect average price over that time frame.  You'll also end up purchasing more units of the asset as the price drops, which reduces your average cost quicker.
That's why it's a highly recommended strategy and why it's taught in every accounting class.

1. SegWit increases throughput
2. If bitcoin becomes popular, this will be the case no matter the blocksize. 
3. Tools exist that allevate those issues.    + RBF.
4. Half the community don't understand what it takes to maintain a global distributed consensus.
5. Good riddance.  
6. Facepalm!
7. Facepunch!
8. Micropayments on LN, will be 100000% more efficient than onchain.
AND 
1. Requires hardfork and proves social engineering + scare tactics about the price of bitcoin are tools for changing consensus.
2. If Bitcoin Classic would die already, the required BIPS would be deployed!
3. Still requires time to work through use cases and build network effects.
4. Sell already!!!  Raising the blocksize does not mean the price will rise.

@_date: 2016-06-15 21:15:41
Because we know what miners will do.  They will include every transaction above their artificial barrier, which they don't consider spam, at the expense of all validating nodes.   As miners process all the transactions you can throw at them, because they're ignorantly chasing Visa, bandwidth requirements grow higher, reducing validating nodes, until it's a couple miners, businesses and kyc hubs left in the network.   
This is the natural path Bitcoin will take if the miners are in control of the throttle. (blocksize limit)

Hardforks are the attack vector that miners have to take when they want to gain more control over the network.  eg. increase bandwidth at the cost of all other nodes, or change the subsidy.  So we should not take it lightly or set a precedent that miners can "urge" a hardfork and get their way.   
Their best interest is to have gigantics blocks, so they can take fees on  every transaction AND have a perpetual subsidy.

If you choose this path, then you go against this:
And you create a new wishy-washing contract system where everything is up to the will of your community and whatever norms happen to be popular this week. 
You must change all marketing material that suggests Ethereum is a neutral platform, that doesn't require trust and doesn't have a 3rd party.   You've essentially created a private blockchain... a walled garden... the AOL of blockchains, where you must follow the unwritten rules of the community that extend beyond your contract code.  


Haha, be prepare to get sued and held liable for everything that happens in your little world.   You guys don't understand the fundamental reason for a blockchain if you're taking this path.   If something bad happens again, you will be expected to fix it, or be held liable for it.   You're opening yourselves up for infinite lawsuits.
The price of Eth is going to drop to zero once the lawsuits start rolling in.   
How do you not see the ramifications?

It's like boiling a frog.  It happens slowly.
The problem is that once you can't keep up with higher requirements, you also can't vote against it.   The network will be solely controlled by large miners and VC fueled exchanges wanting to be the next banking system.

@_date: 2016-06-27 17:40:47
I mostly agree.


Look at what Ethereum is trying to do.  Their community thinks they should hardfork to steal their funds back from a "faulty" but supposedly unstoppable contract.   The community can be very shortsighted at times and if there is a precedent that we can hardfork for whatever reason, it encourages manipulation and jeopardizes the sound principles of Bitcoin.
IMO, we might not ever need to hardfork.  With SegWit, Schnorr sigs, BIP9 flags, softforks, sidechains and L2 solutions such as LN, Bitcoin might be good enough.  We have plenty of avenues to scale on tangential layers while still using bitcoin units.  That's all we really need.  
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:53:00

Yeah, it's moderately expensive, but it's also over 100 years away.  Who knows what kind of level 2 side chains will exist by then.   Bitcoin may not have to hardfork... ever... and still take over the world.  
@_date: 2016-06-27 17:00:53
And this is why we should stop talking about "blocksize" and start talking about capacity increases.   Why does the community think they can dictate a low level code parameter??  
SegWit provides a 60-80% capacity increase and fixes malleability.
Everyone should be happy about that! 
@_date: 2016-06-30 23:49:05

It was a generalization that referred to all smart contract code as being law.


Yes, unpopular contracts should not be nulled out by an unhappy mob.  Smart-contracts should stand on their own, without the need for external judges/jury to decide intent, validity and if they should be upheld.   If Eth softforks, then miners act like judges.  The same way you could claim miners in bitcoin are bankers, if the approve or disapprove of transactions, based on content and not fees.

Awesome calculator!
4MB blocks with 20 connections will max out a 300GB limited broadband connection, pretty easily.  
If you're limited on bandwidth, reducing connections to 8 helps a lot.   My node is usually connected to ~30 other nodes.
I picked 4MB, in the calculator because Core devs mentioned that after SegWit and schnorr sigs, "blocks" should be about that size.   So that's really cutting it close for broadband users. However, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 has --blockonly-mode which really saves on bandwidth, but I don't see that option in the calculator.

Dollar cost averaging means that you spend the same amount of fiat for each purchase.  For example, use Coinbase's reoccuring buy to purchase $50 of bitcoin per day.  As the price goes down, you get more bitcoin.  It quickly turns a horrible BTC entry into something manageable.

Obviously, there is competition in this space. 1000 altcoins exist.  But Bitcoins roadmap with Schnorr, SegWit, and LN is still miles ahead of every other coin.   It keeps the main chain small and decentralized, while giving an outlet for all small value economic activity with LN.

@_date: 2016-06-17 22:51:37
I understand how they work.  The difference is that TheDAO is just fucked up contract, while Eth is still a functioning platform.  So you're bending the integrity of the platform to fix a broken app.  It sets a precedent for further intervention.   If that's the case, the platform will always bend to the will of a contract, or social pressures, then what's the purpose of all this redundancy?

Is there any consideration for nodes in close geographic proximity to each other?   It seems like we're treating LN as an amorphous blob of decentralized amazingness, but economic activity in brick and mortar land is centralized in geographic areas.   
For example, what happens if someone creates a hyper local branded LN wallet to maximize network effects within a market like Arnhem?
Maybe this doesn't matter because the routing algorithm will automatically figure this out?

I'm very familiar with ydtm,. tracked his history back to the early BitcoinXT days where he's spit balling some ideas with knight222 about how to get big blocks to catch on.   He's an interesting evolution of propaganda.  I should write about it someday. 
 There are a few other guys that came from r/BitcoinXT... It's like a little club and they just riff off of each other's lies and FUD.  They have created a following too, which is sad. because big blocks are anti-bitcoin, but interesting at the same time.    
They fundamentally misunderstand Bitcoin and there is no reasoning them.  It's probably the most frustrating think about Bitcoin right now.   If that forum just evaporated one day,. the price would sky rocket.   
Imagine what life would be like without r/btc.   Hardfork drama, gone; circlular scaling arguments, gone; crazy conspiracies that Core devs are compromised, gone;. SegWit activated and moon in sight.

All the evidence I've seen points to a bitcoiner, who is familiar with the game theory of their actions and what kind of position it puts the Ethereum community and leaders in.   They're playing it like a fiddle too.  Ethereum community now has to choose between greed (fork to get money back)  or neutrality (contract executed as designed).  The attacker seems to know this and if the community chooses greed, then their network is no longer neutral and no businesses will run contracts there.   Either way, this controversy paves the way for a more mature and neutral smart contract platform, like RSK and centralized ones like what Microsoft is offering.

Do you know how VCs invest?   They invest in a handfull of companies in the same space hoping that some of them succeed.  They plan on many of their investments not returning a dime.  So in the case of Blockstream, if they don't return investors money, but ensure that Bitcoin is a big success, then that is a good investment for the VCs.  Sometimes you have to invest in supporting companies to make sure others succeed.    That's how it works.

They don't move everything into a single wallet like majority of other exchanges.

That's not a premature optimization.   It's the only way Bitcoin can scale and maintain decentralization and fungibility.  It's also the only way to ensure bitcoin doesn't become so centralized that the miners and a handful of exchanges can "vote"  to increase their block rewards.

If you rely on Coinbase, Circle, etc to send your transactions, then you have to obey their terms of service.   It's the first layer of censorship and you get around it by running your own node.

BU is a horrible idea.  As you quoted, it allows for the majority of miners to drag along the rest of network, up until they can no longer compete and drop off.    You can't vote against the bigger miners, with smaller blocker, because they can simply outcompete you.

@_date: 2016-09-06 23:14:14
From the conclusion:


Have you considered how this is achieved?   Have you thought deeply about the consequences when you can no longer run a node, because the moon kids made blocks too big?   Would the system still be "trustless"?   How can it be un-censorable "cash", if you have to trust other people to run nodes for you?  How can you be sure there's only 21M coins in existence if you can't run a node?  You, the individual, will no longer be able to enforce bitcoins social contract.  Businesses and miners will have full control.
The proponents of on-chain scaling are completely selling out the decentralized trustless nature of bitcoin, so they can naively "scale", and they have said on numerous occasions they are ok with nodes being solely in data-centers.
That is not Satoshi's vision (1 cpu 1 vote) or the original cypherpunk vision.   It's Gavin's and Hearn's vision.

Zander's ignorance is that he assumes he's doing innovative work that the Core devs somehow missed back in 2010.  Hell, I think i still have a spreadsheet in Google docs from when I did my own blocksize calculations and tried to convince Core devs of it.  
The reality is that they understand the intricacies of bitcoin better than anyone.  I then changed my tune, because I could see where they were coming from and how the decentralized concensus network (fungability and accessibility) is more important than the payment network.
Zander's train of thought is the naive and wrong way to scale bitcoin if you're trying to safeguard what makes Bitcoin unique.

How is this even a consideration?  What kind of scenarios do you forsee people "sharing" nodes?  I could not imagine ever sharing a node.  Who controls it?  Which version are they running and how can I protest it?
Scaling in such a way that dismisses an individual's right to run nodes and validate the rules of their money is similar to voiding the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights.   
When I talk about decentralization it's mostly from this frame of reference, because this where the power of Bitcoin is derived.  Without the ability to individually run nodes, we're back to trusting middlemen again and Bitcoin becomes just another boring payment network.   
As an engineer and someone who appreciates the amazing invention that bitcoin is, your methods are simply at odds with the folks who got here first and established Bitcoins social contract.

Because you cant keep doing this method of "scaling" without destroying the trustless nature of the network.

A little bit of fee pressure today ensures we innovate now instead of kicking the can down the road like many wallet devs have been doing for the past 6 years.

Coinbase should auto bump the fees, or give you the option to do it manually.    It's not Bitcoins fault it's being spammed.   This has always been an attack vector and the prime reason that Satoshi added the 1MB limit in the first place.
@_date: 2016-10-17 22:29:05
Sure, but not in majority of human's minds.  They expect to pay a fee relative to the amount of money and the time it takes to send. Noobs dont understand that sending BTC has a marginal cost according to their transaction size.    
My point is that if you're measureing fees you have to put in the context of what the consumer expects.   
From that perspective, Roger Ver complaining about 6 cent fees for sending $26k sounds retarded.... Which it is... Unless you're a Bernie bot, then you think everything should be free.

The funny thing about the entire bitcoin ecosystem is that anyone can do anything.  So any question that starts with "why can't x do y" is pretty ridiculous.  The question is what does Bitpay currently do and does X make sense for Bitpay's business model.
In business, you pick something specific and build a company around it.  You can't do everything, so you have to specialize.   Bitpay is a consumer and retailer focused. Everything is focused around it, just visit their website.
21 Inc, on the other hand, is for developers.  It's a completely different business.
EDIT:  sorry for the tangent..  Why doesn't Bitpay implement payment channels?  My guess is that it isn't required for their primary use case.   21 Inc, is all about computer-computer micro-payments.

Here are just some of the attempts of folks trying to clone Bitcoin.  So it's easy to create another coin, but none of these are that much better than Bitcoin, when it comes to a trustless blockchain.
So now all the experts are thinking that they can take out the token all together and have a blockchain to fix internal auditing issues.     Sounds cool right?   But this is completely different than Bitcoin and serves a completely different use case.

Countries that default on their debt will steal your savings from the banks and/or inflate away all the value of the dollars/pesos you have hidden under your mattress.
Bitcoin changes that. 
You own your money and they can't inflate it away or steal it when the State defaults.
They have to send you a bill and ask you to pay, or show up at your front door and force you to pay at the point of a gun. Thus revealing the true colors of the State.

What Blythe says is pretty scary.  
To paraphrase the video:
Basically, the government is going to outlaw bitcoin, create their own currency so that they can steal money from you using negative interest rates/inflation AND also track all your transactions.    You can expect this new digital currency to be packaged as "stability", but really, it's more top down control.  
People in the 1990s, dreamt that the internet would make governments obsolete and usher in a new era of freedom, but it just allowed the government to spy on your every move.  Bitcoin is going to be the same.
There will never be a private currency because there is no lender of last resort, therefore a boom will be followed by a bust and collapse.  The currency will self-destruct on it's own, because it doesn't have a central bank.
Governments/banks will use the technology for their own good and bitcoin will be irrelevant.  Jamie Dimon was right, commence circle-jerk.
Nobody knows how money works today.. It's just hopefully there when you need it. (chuckle chuckle)
Moderator:  If we're using digital currency, why not get rid of all banks, except the central bank, and everyone just have an account with them?
Use of cash is growing...
What does a bank provide its customer?
Banks let google and apple get into identity management, but Blythe thinks banks will be getting back into this business and recoup it back from silicon valley.   (ya fucking right).

Just look at the 21Inc Bitcoin computer as an example.  
It's primary purpose is to enable developers to create micro-services and sell them.  Its secondary purpose is mining.  
So the fact that is costs $5 a month to run and earns $1 in BTC is irrelevant because the user values the primary use case over mining. 
Extrapolate this thinking to other devices like heaters, wifi access points, parking meters, robots, phones, etc and you end up with a billion devices that mine as a secondary function.    This removes all profitability from the mining market and socializes the cost to things that we use everyday.    
Here's the same conversation.

In the context of bitcoin and current market price, then its value is 1 BTC = $360, regardless of subdivision of units.   
Likewise you can't convince anyone that because a piece of gold is made out of billions of atoms, that as a whole, it should be worth less.   The market has to naturally find the price that people are willing to pay for it, regardless of divisibility.     Bitcoin went from 10,000 BTC = 2 pizzas and has gone up in value since.  There's no way to reverse that without destroying bitcoin or erasing everyone's memory.
@_date: 2015-11-13 18:49:48
Financial singularity, in the context of this sub, obviously means Bitcoin.    If you, me and everyone else decides to hold a portion of their wealth, if not all of their wealth in an inflation free currency that is outside the control of the State, then we hold the power.
Obviously, we still have to pay our taxes or go to jail, but the point is that the State must send you a bill.  They can't take it from you without your consent. (due process + your consent)   We have super powers with bitcoin.
"internet-empathy", is what we're seeing with youtube videos documenting police brutality and causing everyone to question their behaviors.  It's why police are being required to wear cameras, so that their point of view is known.    The amount of force that the police and military use is being double checked via the internet and the public is judging these actions and policy is changing because of it.
War has changed significantly because of this and is the prime reason for the increased use of drones.
We also empathize with disaster victims moments after something happens because of Twitter.  If everyone used a boarder-less digital currency, then we could instantly channel money to folks who need it.  
The internet + sovereign currency makes it harder for States to go to war.   Because everyone can empathize with the people in the other country AND your government must send you a bill for the War they want to create.  
The people might just say no....

It's so that developers can get a sense of what kind of apps and services they can build using micro-transactions.  It's a dev network.  Many different services will be born here and then expanded to handle scale.  These services are sending around satoshis, why would you need to send a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a cent to your dev box to test things out?  It's ridiculous.   Having a miner ensures that these devices are PLUG AND PLAY.
Here is a rendezvous service to advertise various services
* List of names costs 1 satoshi.
* Names cost 10 satoshis/hour to exist, after which they are removed.
@_date: 2015-11-17 02:06:02
For old services, yes, but there isn't anything preventing new services to popup that do the exact same thing and accept bitcoin on a per request basis.  Regulation is always localized to some physical location.

Miners set the fees.  It doesn't matter if blocks are empty or full.   I've been paying fees for years, even though most blocks are not full, because if I don't, my transaction is stuck in limbo for days.   This has always been the case.  If I'm trying to sell some coins on an exchange ASAP, then I double the fee, because it's a priority to me.    This is how real markets work.  It has little to do with the marginal cost according to blocksize for the miner, it's based on how much you're willing to pay for the utility.

Ideal money is about creating a basket of commodities to represent an indexed store of value based on usage in the related economy.   This should prevent gold from becoming too expensive and allow the price to fall so we can use it for industrial purposes instead of a status symbol.
The issue with his ideal money is that it's corruptible.  Who prints the tokens?   
I think we're going to find the price stability is irrelevant in the 21st century due to digital price tags.   This means a central banks role to keep an eye on "inflation" will be irrelevant and all prices can fluctuate according to supply and demand.

OH RELLAY?  All I see is a dwindling price.  Lets be honest about Cripple.   There isn't anything special about their tech and network effects don't mean shit with it.  Primarily because you don't need miners.  You don't even need a liquid token market.  Their network can be ran 100% by Ripple and it doesn't make any difference.   
IBM is going to create essentially the same thing and probably bring on board other tech companies who want to experiment with the Internet of Things.   They'll probably create another blockchain for banks to use.   Wanna know why it's going to be easy for them?  Because IBM already has relationships with the biggest companies on the planet.  There is no way Ripple can compete with that.
Bitcoin is entirely different because it is independent, trustless, and bootstrapping with it's own market and coin.   Bitcoin is easy to clone, but very hard to dislodge because of it's strong miner and exchange networks.
Ripple has ZERO chance of long term adoption. ZERO.

The crux of money today is "inflation".  All we need is a fixed money supply and everything else will balance out.  It doesn't even need to be based on a basket of commodities.   The only reason he proposes that is for inflation targeting.   But inflation targeting is only relevant for "price stability".  But what is price stability in the digital age?    Think about Amazon, eBay, Uber, AirBnb, Expedia.  The marketplace is filled full of variable pricing for the exact same product dependant upon your surfing habits. 
We can create a price index that is based on commodities, but there is no reason for that index to be our money.   Trying to index our money is retarded in this day and age.

The point that your post fails to grasp is that it's not "for profit mining",  it mines so that your devices have some satoshis to interact with various paid APIs.

Yes,  the Ripple consensus of trusted parties.  But their native token is essentially worthless and is controlled by a central party.  Others are free to help 'verify' transactions, but you're kidding yourself if you think those other nodes have a say in how the network operates.

These "new" users, aren't actually using the blockchain.  They're gambling off chain, so it won't translate into a massive influx of transactions. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:31:25
We don't need a million blockchains.  If we had a million of them then lots of them will die off and the data will be gone.  The whole purpose of having one chain is that you can rely on it always being there.   With each new blockchain means there is a new software interface and new trusted parties that may or may not be here tomorrow.  
I'm sure that a few blockchains for the Internet of Things will live for several years, but at the same time, companies will probably create a new chain for their newer hardware/software/partnerships thus depreciating the old.   If you're just using a blockchain to record ephemeral data, then it's not a big deal, but if you want a proof of existence, then you'll have to use the chain with the most staying power (Bitcoin).

My point is that in 20 years, dedicated miners (as a profit model) will be an relic from Bitcoin's bootstrapping process.  (CPU, GPU, FGPA, ASIC, Micro-ASIC)
What will be left over is a global network of micro-nodes providing more hashing power than centralized miners could ever afford.
@_date: 2015-11-17 18:28:26
Mining costs have to be socialized across all participants of the bitcoin ecosystem eventually.. This is just the first micro step.   
Compare the amount of computing power in all the server farms across the globe, to the computing power of all small computing devices (tablets, phones, PCs).   The small devices are more powerful.
Bitcoin mining is headed in the same direction.... Distributed, decentralized and the cost is socialized.   This is the only way to break the huge mining farms monopoly on hashpower.

Check this out:
Scroll down to the Full List of ASIC mining hardware and count how many different brands of ASICs there were.    They were all competing on a level playing field and chose to enter the market because they had a chance.
Once you add patents to the system, this diversity will drop to those who pay for the license, those who infringe upon it and those who are at 20% hash/$ disadvantage.
Who is going to invest in building the next gen of ASICs, **inside patent enforcing countries**, when they only have one choice?  Plus, if they do decide to license the tech, they will still be at a disadvantage because the patent holder is a vampire on their bottom line.
To make matters worse, China doesn't play by the same rules.   They not only have cheaper power, they also don't give a shit about patents.
If you want to see 90% of the hashrate move to China, this is how it's going to happen!

It's not that black and white.  Many will mine at a loss, because they're still accumulating coin, which they can hold, in hopes that the price goes up before their bills are due.   They are speculators and they have gold fever... just listen to the videos they post.  
They get all excited when they talk about bitcoin getting more popular.
You need to take into account these two factors.
1.  What is their ROI timeline?
2.  When are their debts are due?
These two answers vary between miners and are more important than "the halfing" and the current exchange rate.   It also means that no two miners will come to the same conclusion(shutdown) at the same time.

You pretty much have it covered.  Yes, smart contracts will create a secure and fair betting platform.  Bootstrapping is always an issue with a new market.  Look at Gemini, but over time liquidity will grow and more users will join.  I don't participate in sports betting, so I don't know what these sites offer, but I could imagine that they focused on US sports.  An international, decentralized/distributed platform would cater to the rest of world of sports.
I know that many naysays like to poo-poo on smart contracts, because we don't have great use cases of them in action yet, but it's coming.  It's just takes time to put the logic together.  But once it is built, documented and shared, it creates reusable unbreakable contracts.   You can't argue with that.

One guy talked about "blockchain" being open for everyone, like Java.  If he's saying that, then he's talking about Bitcoin.  Because there is no way the global banks will create a blockchain that is open for anyone to innovate on while maintaining control of it.   They have to have permissions and a control system to prevent all the malicious transactions that happen in the bitcoin space right now.  They're not gonna give that up.  
One thing that is scary about this though, is that they are just a few steps away from creating their own global chain, and thus a global currency, which they control.  
It comes down to choosing between Bitcoin, which is being controlled by miners and users, VS bankcoin, which is controlled by the banks and governments.

All you need is a few large tech companies to attach themselves to the network and it would work out just fine for their use cases.     Instead of having random people around the world building a trustless ledger, you'll have Microsoft, IBM, Google, Apple, Samsung, etc all providing a distributed consensus for THEIR internet of things.   
Of course, not everyone will trust that group of companies, so another group of companies will create their own. 
I think we will have several Internet of Things networks ran by various consortiums around the world.  And bitcoin will co-exist in this space as well.  Bitcoin has a very different and unique value proposition compared to a distributed trusted consensus network.
@_date: 2015-03-11 20:12:28
I think it's because Bitcoin is being bootstrapped from nothing with no one company behind it.   Think of the amount of manpower, partnerships, and advertising dollars behind Apple Pay to bring it to the mainstream.   
Bitcoin is grass roots, that's why it's different.   We have to spread the word because we don't have billion dollar budgets.   We all know that bitcoin is a potential game changer, but the largest companies in this space are NEW with no mind share.  Coinbase is the biggest.  
If Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc started to use bitcoin in their mobile app stores for GLOBAL payments and payouts, you would see overnight consumer adoption of the bitcoin token, but people still wouldn't understand the bigger picture of smart-contracts for some time.
The learning curve of bitcoin is huge.  It's probably bigger than the internet because the advantages are not as obvious.   My friends don't see the point of it because they've never had to wire money overseas for anything.   I've had to do it multiple time and it's a pain in the ass.  I've purchased things from all over the world so I understand that a problem exists and that bitcoin makes it easier.  They don't do these sorts of things, so they don't see any advantage.   
Apple pay is interesting because it says "let me digitize your credit card so that you don't have to carry it around anymore"   Bitcoin doesn't have a value proposition like that for the average Joe.   
It could be "Use bitcoin so you can purchased stuff from anyone in the world"  But most people don't understand that payment processing is one of the barriers preventing them from ordering direct from someone in Iran.  Global trade is where bitcoin can flourish, but only a small fraction of people ever run across this market.

My prediction is that the regulation you find will require putting a figure head in charge of something that they can't possible control.  In doing so, they will have an impossible mandate to follow, which will waste money and provide very little benefit.   
The dark markets will always exist, because they deal in illicit goods.  If those goods were not illegal, then you could actually regulate the market participants the same way one might regulate Amazon.com.

Bitcoin has one shot.  You can't regulate it and then unregulate it later to give people control of their money back.  It doesn't work like that.  Bitcoin only exists because it's a sharp contrast to our existing system and gives you real ownership of everyday digital money.  
The day we can't hold our keys anymore due to "consumer protections" is the day Bitcoin dies.
You also have to consider bitcoin's other killer feature. It allows computers to transact value with each other, without requiring any identify information.  If you KYC and consumerify it, then that feature will disappear too.   
Can you imagine what the internet would be like if every computer had to be perfectly identified and approved?   Ya me neither, because it wouldn't exist.

It's not expensive. Blocks should always be full, and we should have better wallets with RBF and dynamic fees.   Nothing is stopping retailers from accepting bitcoin.  Coinbase and Bitpay have basically solved all their problems and yet retail adoption is lack luster.  Why?  Because 95% of us buy bitcoin to HODL.   Mass retail adoption is years away, so chill out chicken little.

They'll use a distributed consensus protocol like Ripple or Stellar.  All member banks will run a node to help verify transactions.  They'll be able to loan each other money and pass ownership of things around the world in an instant.  The underlying token in this network would be worthless.  It doesn't need to have value, because their network doesn't need to be bootstrapped through untrusted parties.   They don't need mining either because it's not a competition, they just need to establish a consensus.
This is the sort of network IBM is probably creating.  If you have enough trusted partners, then you don't need proof of work.   Imagine if IBM, Microsoft, Samsung, Apple, etc..  all ran nodes for the internet of things.   Of course this network would be a consortium of companies that plan on developing apps using the chain.  Would it be 100% open like bitcoin? Probably not.

However, one can imagine if we had a deflationary currency then this fellas work from 40 years ago would not be worth 20% of what it used to.  My grand parents used to say things like a 'a penny saved is a penny earned'  but with inflationary currency that's not true.  The value of that penny just depreciates, so you're better off buying some durable good instead of saving it.  This has been an issue since the Fed was created.

It doesn't work like that if majority of coins are already on ice.  If 90% of coins traded hands on a monthly basis, then we could see a difference because suddenly there is a lack of supply for the demand.   
My point is that the price will only shift if you are reducing the number of coins that are regularly circulating.   Otherwise it's like a tree falling in the forest and know one hearing it.

A decentralized trustless blockchain requires a token that incentivizes miners to secure it with hashing power.    If you don't like the token, which can be used as money and compensate miners, then you have to select trusted parties to control the blockchain.  
Bitcoin is trustless and open... that's the key invention. Since it doesn't have trusted parties who front the bill for running the network, it must be a self sustaining.   So if bitcoin price goes the 0.  Bitcoin, the trustless network, will also fail.

The security.  All altcoins are open for attack if any amount of value is on those chain.  They are insecure.  If you're building machines that need to connect and negotiate value for years or maybe decades to come, you're not going to attach it to an altcoin, Samsung coin or JPM coin.   You're going to attach it to the strongest, independent blockchain on the planet, which is bitcoin.


There are about 400 altcoins out there... which one is gaining any traction on bitcoin?   Which one is the average Joe just clamoring to buy up because it's so magical for them?  None.  Paycoin was a complete scam and so are 99% of altcoins.
Average Joe is not ready for crypto-money and bitcoin isn't ready for mass adoption yet.  We need Lightning Networks and compatible wallets first,  Otherwise we'll run into the block size cap in a few days and piss off a bunch of average joes who don't understand they need to send a replace by fee transaction to get his first transaction confirmed.

No, read my last message and try again.




There are two different issues that you some how cannot distinguished between. 
1)  Mining Centralization is the important one:  Developers and the general bitcoin ecosystem are always worried about this.  It has been an issue from day 1, that everyone understands.     This is the real problem that will KILL bitcoin and ruin fungibility.   This is why core developers agree and discuss it on their mailing list.   Everyone knows this!   Except for you apparently?  This whole thread is about this issue.
However, some how you try to twist it into this:
2) Developer centralization, which is a new issue that was created by the Classic/XT cult.  Gavin and Mike didn't get their way with raising the blocksize because they couldn't gain developer consensus for it to happen.  They cried foul and declared that development is too centralized and next thing you know filled up with sock-puppets repeating this and spewing ad-hominems against Core.
So let me reiterate!!!!
Bitcoin developers job, from day 1, is to keep an eye on mining centralization and try to keep the playing field level.  Hence inventions like block relay, and minimizing orphans.   The fact that they come together to discuss crazy things like hardforking to prevent it, is expected!

21 Inc "miners", and others, will eventually commoditize the hardware and out-hash all for profit dedicated miners putting all of them out of business.    This is way off, probably like 2055 or something.
However, at the same time the folks running miners, won't actually care that it's "mining" at a loss, because it enables them to resell their idle home computing power, plus other things, for more useful tasks.  Thus, the utility of being connected to the network, selling things, in the world of the internet of things, will be worth more than electricity used to secure the network.

It's a game of chicken.  Miners will wait to see who flinches first and then will act accordingly.  They will not look at some chart or exchange rate and act independent of all other miners, therefore the odds of all miners turning off their equipment at the same time is near zero.

If the currency that the people hold is not tied to the local calamities, then they have less to worry about.    Assuming that the currency they do hold is stable or appreciating.   
Once you start using digital currencies, you can quickly move to the one that fits your needs.   If you have bitcoin, but want something more stable then switch to BitUSD or BitGold.  If you're buying something online, then quickly convert one of those to bitcoin when you need to.    Nearly instant currency and asset exchanges will create a much more liquid and global financial ecosystem.  All thanks to Bitcoin.

If we changed bitcoin in any way to reflect views of the majority, it would be socialism and wealth reallocation on demand.  
Bitcoin is the opposite.  Bitcoin allows you to truely own your money.  It's not just some account balance in a ledger at a bank that can be change at will.
The views of the majority are already reflected in the fiat money system.  The majority thinks inflation is good, central banks are here to help and drugs are bad.
Bitcoin has a fundamentally different set of values and you have to change your world view for it to make sense and only then will you appreciate what it has to offer.
@_date: 2016-05-31 15:51:14
"Use"  they should hodl it the same as us. IMO, it's a smart hedge.   Everyone knows that fiat only goes down in value.  
@_date: 2016-05-31 16:32:27
Yes, I understand the differences and am aware of the over simplification I used when saying "printing money".  
How do you expect the central banks to unwind their balance sheets and reduce their liabilities?    
Just because they use an accounting trick that says if money is "created" it becomes a liability, doesn't change the fact that they conjured  wealth out of thin air and applied it to someone else's balance sheet.  
You can then argue about the multiplier, and bank reserves that are required for loans and blah blah blah, but it's all of shell game.  All of these numbers are astronomical because they've been playing this game for over 300 years.   
The end game is a massive default, because you can't keep leveraging future earning potential when things stagnate.   Stagflation will occur because they treat credit like an unlimited resource in a world of limited resources.   
But what do I know?  I'm just a dumb bitcoiner.

You have no idea what you're talking about.
       
You can't choose which chain you're "dumping on"   It's up to the exchanges to decide which chain they want to allow deposits and withdraws from.   Exchanges will probably freeze bitcoin deposits/withdraws for a few hours while the miners upgrade their clients.  Otherwise they run the risk of double spends.

In addition, it causes everyone to ask the question "What is money?"    Why can the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world create capital whenever they want?

How is it that we use a unit of account that the creators can change the value of at will?  
@_date: 2015-10-12 22:38:08
The only way to have a full paper trail is to create the token within the blockchain and keep track of where it goes.  You can't just have a system where you stuff messages that did not originate in THAT blockchain.  Otherwise you have to perform a settlement function.

Approximately every 2 weeks, the network recalculates the difficulty based on the time between all the blocks created, within that interval.  So if more hashing power is added, which speeds up the block creation over a period, then the difficultly is increased, to keep the target at 10 minutes.

From Wikipedia:


Capital is an input for production.  If you destroy BTC, which could be used as an input to further increase productivity, then you have destroyed capital.   By destroying it, it doesn't suddenly allow all actors in the market to be more productive or efficient.  In fact, it doesn't change anything at all.  It has zero effect, when it could have been put to good use.

jratcliff had a great comment, but it got buried in an another thread by manipulators.






However, there are real limits here as well. Eventually, there will not be enough on chain capacity to support the number of new users who wish to open and close payment channels.


Once this becomes the case, there are two ways to solve the problem. First, we could raise the main bitcoin blocksize to accommodate more channel open/close requests. However, as this article argues well, this may not be desirable.
The other solution would be to on-ramp new users via two-way-pegged sidechains (another piece of technology which does not yet exist). A two-way-pegged sidechain functions essentially as a 'shard' of the main bitcoin blockchain. It allows users to transact value which is 100% pegged to bitcoin on the main chain, safely and securely, 


One of the most remarkable aspects of the Lightning Network is that it can freely inter-operate across multiple sidechains at the same time, so long as they offer the same requisite cryptographic features as the bitcoin network provides.

Only in POW systems.  There are other systems where you don't have to expend tons of energy and follow the longest chain , you just have to insert a certain level of trust.    Banks and Preston talk about permissioned blockchains all the time and they will work fine for settlement between them, especially if they're exchanging tokens that have value.


The most important trait of a blockchain is that it's append only.  You're not ever supposed to go back in time and correct things.  If banks are sharing a blockchain to help settlemen,t then a huge red flag would go up if someone tried to roll something back.


Only in zero trust environments where POW is required.  Banks can trust each other to a certain degree.   The trusted system that Joyce talked about with KYC bullshit in Stellar is a perfect example.  They're trying to tweak their system in anyway they can to make it appealing to banks, but it's not open or decentralized or zero trust.  But it will work for banks who agree to that system.


ACH/SWIFT are just messaging hubs.  Settlement still has to happen, whether its already escrowed or they're sending an armored truck.
Having native tokens on their own blockchain would allow them to send real value from bank to bank without any settlement or 3rd party involved.  
There are big unanswered questions here like: What is that token and what is it backed by?  How does it have a market value and who sells it to everyone initially?  How liquid is that market?  Maybe the IMF gets involved and creates a token based on some index of gold+usd+eur+cny+jpy.  If they don't have a token which has value, then this tech is useless.
Ripple and Stellar have been trying to get their shitcoin inserted into the banks systems for years, but odds are banks will create their own.

You make a good point with the subsidies, but it comes at a huge sustained cost, as the inflation rate is 100% APR a year, forever!  So no one is encouraged to hold STEEM, unless the site is growing exponentially.   It's in a bubble mode, and once it pops, I don't see how the rewards will ever be like they are right now.

You're wrong.  Every full-node validates the entire block.  If a miner tries to double spend, or create coins out of thin air, all full-nodes will reject it.

Ya, I would imagine the sweet spot for LN being sub $100 transactions.   That would free up a lot of blockspace for large transactions though.  Especially, if they are settlement transactions that don't require priority.
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:42:54
You've stated your position many times in the past.   There's no strawman here.
Is it not true, that you encouraged the hardfork to Classic?  
Oh, by the way, how's your ethereum investment doing?  We're all watching the effects of a contentious hardfork in action, and the subsequent price drop.  Let's see how the market likes their first moon kid bailout.
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:57:59
Oh Shit You're Wrong!
Bitcoin is controlled by miners and they don't give a fuck about your shit faced opinion.  
Miners are going to choose the fork the chain to the larger blocksize because it will allow more transactions to occur on the network which means it can support more users and they make more money in the long run.   
Simple as that.
@_date: 2016-07-07 21:45:39


I've heard many arguments from both sides, and there's still a lot of disagreement which makes a hardfork very difficult to pull off.  Plus, we have better solutions in the pipeline that don't require hardforking.
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:14:50

You can't have a "trustless" network, if you can't run a full-node!
In addition, I don't trust miners with the consensus rules!  They will obviously continue to centralize, unless we run full-nodes to prevent them from stealing the network.

It gets rejected by my node and all the other full-nodes in the network running the current consensus.   Miners can't change the rules on a whim.   We have 5000 nodes that keep the miners in check.

Are you kidding?   They have to lobby a bunch of faceless kids to execute the hardfork so they can get their money back.   The odds of an existing company risking any amount of wealth a on system that operates like this is near zero.   
Why not use Microsoft's blockchain/smart contract solutions instead, where there is a defined rollback procedures and you don't have to pander to a bunch of moon kids, which may disagree with you because `reasons`.
Ethereum is no longer neutral, and now resembles a religion or cult, where they define right vs wrong, beyond the execution of their contracts.   There is no going back after this hardfork and the project is doomed IMO.
RSK will steal their value proposition.

The implications here are amazing.  I imagine having smart contracts with a RSK sidechain, privacy oriented sidechain with confidential transactions, and of course a dogecoin tipping chain so the moon kids can throw pennies at each other.

If Bitcoin wins and becomes digital gold for the entire global economy, then we'll be measuring everything in terms of BTC, not $.   I would expect at least a 1000x increase in value from today's prices.
No longer will it be, $1 for a banana.  It will be 0.00000001 BTC.   The most interesting apsect of deflationary monetary base, is that over time, the prices of everything will continue to go down in terms of BTC, as the economy grows and becomes more efficient. 
Each time we make an efficiency advancement in some sector, prices will drop, and capital will be freed up for the next undertaking.  I think deflationary currency will allow us to enter a technological golden age.

He also envisioned that everyone could be miners.  Once pooled mining took over, then ASICs, it completely disrupted his original plan.   We're in uncharted territory, trying to keep the consensus decentralized, while being attacked from all angles by forces of centralization.
@_date: 2016-05-11 21:43:17


I'm sure it's debatable. Everything is up for debate, if you want to play devils advocate and waste everyone's time.


 
Holy fucking shit.   Something is seriously broken in your mind if you think creating patents to prevent competition is even remotely similar to the ASIC manufactures competing on their manufacturing processes of today.   
Once you get the legal system behind you, you begin to build an industry similar to x86 and Intel vs AMD.    
Some times there is only ONE technological path forward and once you create patents, you establish a toll road that everyone else has to take, while you continue blazing forward, strengthening your monopoly and placing landmines for your competitors to stumble over.
Which leads to more CENTRALIZATION!

From everything I've read, it doesn't look like there is any need to hardfork to do a blocksize increase, because we'll have the hooks to extent beyond the so called "crippled" chain, using things like LN and sidechains.   It's a still a few years out,  before all of these pieces come together, but it's clear that extending bitcoin this way ensures that the 21M limit will be intact, the base network will always be censorship resistant, and anyone who wants to, will be able to validate the consensus. 
L2 solutions and sidechains will probably come and go, but L1 bitcoin will remain strong and unchanged, as we shuffle bitcoin units through a myriad of different systems.
I like to think about L1 Bitcoin as the digital gold layer, while L2 + sidechains as the application layers. 
The biggest issue today is that the moon kids want to do everything onchain which jeopardizes the foundation of one of the most unique inventions of the 21 century.   
 As jratcliff said:   


If you believe in Bitcoin Maximalism, then the layered approach is the correct path to ensure that we get to have our cake (digital gold) and eat it too. (trustless high throughput systems)
