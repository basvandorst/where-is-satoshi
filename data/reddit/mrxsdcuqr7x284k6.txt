Running a full node is great, but you'll have to run transactions through it for it to help the network in any meaningful way. I was excited to learn that the Trusted Node feature of Samourai Wallet lets you link your wallet to your own node using the existing RPC interface built in to bitcoind. I set up a full node, disabled the local wallet, set it to allow RPC calls from anywhere (with a huge random password) and configured Samourai to use my node instead of their official ones. It works quite well - all the convenience of a good mobile wallet with no reliance on third-party servers.
Setting up a full node on Ubuntu is quite easy - if you have some Linux command line experience - but a dedicated black box would be even better.

Bitcoin's worth is tied to the utility it provides. It has no inherent value. Neither does USD, gold, or anything else we use as a unit of exchange.
Bitcoin's utility is that it allows value to be moved around easily over the internet without a mediating third party. The ability to do that provides value to people who need to -- or want to -- move money around without passing through a bank. It's a legitimate need for a variety of both legal and non-legal activities.
The problem with a low-value bitcoin ($500, $1.25, etc.) is that larger exchanges of currency have a larger impact on the exchange rate. If I want to move a million bucks worth of value to my parents in another country via bitcoin, both my purchase and their sale of the coin will move the markets massively if bitcoins are trading for a dollar each. But if bitcoin is trading for $10k each, it's no problem.
tl;dr: Cheap bitcoin is inherently less useful than expensive bitcoin. Therefore, bitcoin cannot be both successful and cheap.

This has been fun to experiment with. I've bought a lot of virtual coffee. :)
Is there any way to tell whether your current channels have a connection to a particular destination? I opened channels to a couple random well-connected nodes. Through them I was able to buy coffees and send funds to a testnet web wallet. But all my attempts to buy access to content from Yalls failed with no apparent error message. Assuming I want to buy from a new vendor, how can I determine whether or not I already have a route to them?
Also, an error message when a channel open fails would be really useful from a UI standpoint.

Adding "prune=20000" to bitcoin.conf is the correct syntax, so it should work. That would set the max blockchain storage to 20GB.

*This rate-limiting is no joke, only a few withdrawals are permitted a year. Each withdraw has to be permitted by the majority of the hashrate also by consent. Meaning when BTC is deposited from mainchain to the sidechain, they are placed in a special account.*
*This account is owned by the miners. The Miners can actually send these funds wherever they like. Although this sounds like a problem, by design this account (called a box) is only allowed to be opened infrequently - two or three times a year.* 
This sounds terrible. How does it work in practice? If I want to create a new Drivechain, do I need to get a majority of miners to agree to do it? If I want to commit funds to someone else's Drivechain, can it only be done 2-3 times per year?
Are miners required to run a special version of the node software to participate? Is a softfork or hardfork required?

IIRC, the flippening refers to the exchange rate for BCH surpassing BTC. A side effect of that would be miners rapidly abandoning BTC, leaving it frozen and worthless.

It can be helpful to look at the decisions in reverse. Let's say you owe $20k in student loans at 4% annual interest. Now, image you no longer had the loan. In that situation, would you borrow $20k at 4% interest to buy bitcoin?
If yes, keep the bitcoin. If no, pay off the loan. If you're not sure, pay off part of the loan.
Don't forget to factor in tax implications, long-term vs short-term capital gains rates, etc. It's a pain, but it you really want to make a thoughtful decision you need to understand the numbers.
Finally, remember that it's possible to "believe in bitcoin" without risking your entire financial future on it. There is no shame in hedging your bets.

I'm going to buck the trend here and state that paper wallets are not inherently less secure than hardware wallets. At core they have the same vulnerability: the human interacting with them.
A paper wallet generated and printed while offline on an uncompromised computer is very secure. If your wallet was raided, that means your private key got exposed at some point.  Since you never transferred BTC out of of the wallet, it must have happened when you initially generated the private key. Either [bitcoinpaperwallet.com]( is compromised (possible but unlikely) or you computer is infected with something watching for private keys (very likely).
I'm sorry for your loss. 22BTC is a lot to lose. You should assume the computer you used to generate that paper wallet is compromised and do a secure wipe and reinstall the OS. Was it a Windows machine?

I just recreated what you described and got the same result.
1. created a paper wallet w/ [bitaddress.org]( ( 13zyZNLSb1uFNR9kF4MBZhTzXXDSaz9Qzk )
2. sent a small test payment to it
3. used Mycelium to sweep a partial amount from it back to mycelium ( bc1q5memffkyjrahmjptst6pqglr3zgj8wfxq94c4g )
4. the remaining change balance was automatically sent to a new segwit address ( bc1qyrnjca4tr26vdtnsvwgmave8xf7mlsytm34sy7 )
Here's the address history:
Now here's the crazy part -- even though the block explorer shows your paper wallet is empty, **you can still get your missing change back**. The change is still in the paper wallet, despite what the block explorer reports. Mycelium sent it to the **segwit equivalent** of the original paper wallet. As a result, the block explorer won't see the funds unless you search using the new address.
Fortunately, Mycelium will sweep both the standard and segwit versions of your paper wallet. To get your change back, use Mycelium's cold storage sweep option to sweep the private key from your paper wallet. You'll find the change is in there. You can either leave it there, or send it back to the standard public key of your paper wallet ( [1HrDXPG3ZNH4DmfzgWLtGW49wfgVw54jbJ]( **)** if you'd like to see them in the block explorer again.

The incentive for the average consumer is simple - you can buy online without risk that someone will steal from you.
Bitcoin is a **push** payment system. You decide what you want to buy, then you push the payment to the seller. Just like cash. The antiquated system it's replacing -- credit cards -- is a **pull** payment system. You give the seller access to your account, and they pull out the right amount. You hope.
Here's a real-world example. I buy equipment online from [Newegg.com]( several times a year. Before they started accepting bitcoin, I kept a credit card on file with them to make purchases. Afterwards I deleted the card info and started paying exclusively with bitcoin.
Less than a month ago, Newegg announced that they had fallen victim to a security breach and credit card information for many of their customers had been stolen.
Because cards are a **pull** system, the thief can start charging those cards immediately. It's up to the merchant to secure the card info, and up to the consumer to dispute charges and hope they can get their money back afterwards.
Because bitcoin is a push system, money only leaves my account when I say so. There's nothing for a thief to steal. A hacker can steal from Newegg, but they can't steal from its customers.
**This feature alone makes bitcoin better that credit cards, right now, today.** The other inconveniences you mention are technical or regulatory and will be resolved sooner or later. It's just a matter of time.
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:08:15
All this is true. But all this infrastructure built around security and dispute resolution is a service you have to pay for. Credit card companies try to conceal that fact by charging their transaction fees to the vendor, who then pass the cost along to you in the form of higher prices. That's why many vendors offer a discount for customers who pay in crypto.
Now let's talk about that lovely consumer protection that the card companies provide. The shady vendors who may send you a bag of rocks are the ones who are most likely to sell your credit card info to the highest bidder. In the much more common scenario of buying from an established vendor (like Newegg), you generally don't need fraud protection. Newegg is not going to defraud you - they have too much to lose. And even if they do, fraud is a crime... call the police! Why pay extra to a credit card company for protection you don't need?

I use the Mycelium wallet, which allows you to create a transaction using a private key on a paper wallet. If spending less that the total amount in the paper wallet address, any change is automatically sent back to the paper wallet address.
I agree, reusing a paper wallet as I describe is not really "cold storage". Maybe a better term would be "offline storage". No keys are stored on my phone, and it's impossible to remote hack a piece of paper. A hardware wallet would have better security but is more expensive and less convenient  IMHO.

Thanks for the share. Andreas seems to be staring into my soul as he talks into the camera.

For my part, I know how to securely create a paper wallet, but I wonder if the act of reusing the same address  multiple times exposes me to any vulnerability where the private key can be deduced from multiple transactions on the blockchain. From what I've read, that was possible in earlier versions of bitcoin but those weaknesses have already been addressed. I'll keep looking.

Interesting question. Have you ever wondered why houses increase in value over time? Why should your house be worth more after 30 years than it was when you first built it? Just about everything else gets less valuable as it gets older.
There are lots of factors that push home prices up and down, but one factor that consistently pushes home prices up is devaluation of money. People need to live somewhere, and money gets less valuable every year, so home prices tend to increase, especially over a long time frame - like a 30 year mortgage.
As long as people value bitcoin in relation to their national currency, bitcoin will continue to go up. When we someday reach a bitcoin economy, people won't think in terms of dollar values anymore. Now, imagine that bitcoin mortgage scenario again. Let's say a lender wants to finance your house at a 5% interest rate. The house costs 100 BTC and you're paying for it over 100 months. You pay the lender 1.05 BTC each month until it's paid off. When you've paid off the mortgage, the house is still worth 100 BTC and you've paid the lender 5 BTC for the loan. Easy peasy.

This is what I'm trying to learn more about. What does "determined by the network itself" mean?

Look at a price chart and you'll see the price has moved up and down a lot more that .0002%
That said, I agree it looks like it's being held in place at $6400. 
The bullish scenario is that it's being held in place to increase the odds that an ETF gets approved. The previous denials mentioned volatility as one of the reasons for rejection.
The bear scenario is that someone is dumping a lot of coins off the exchanges, and making just enough on-exchange buys to keep the price up while they continue to dump.

The problem is there are 3 parties to this transaction, not just two: you, the unnamed business that was attempting to pay you, and Coinbase. From the Coinbase perspective, you're claiming that a third party sent them bitcoin by mistake and you now want Coinbase to forward it to you. That would not be legal.
You need to contact the third party and tell them they sent the funds to the wrong address and they still owe you money. The third party will need to contact Coinbase to get the funds back, not you. Explain to the third party that you can't negotiate with Coinbase on their behalf, and if they refuse to pay, be prepared to sue them for the money.

The Tulip Trust story makes more sense in context of the Le Roux scenario. Wright gets Le Roux arrested and swipes his hard drive. Wright gives it to Kleiman to decrypt since Kleiman actually knows what he's doing. Wright takes it back after Kleiman dies, which is the basis for the ongoing lawsuit. Wright fabricates the Tulip Trust to buy himself several years to decrypt the drive. But things don't go as planned, so Wright recruits Ayre, promising him a share of the fortune if he bankrolls the hardware needed to brute-force decrypt the drive. Wright also needs Ayre to publicly back up his claim to be Satoshi so he can legally sell the fortune when the decryption eventually succeeds. Ayre, a gambling man looking for his next adventure, starts buying up hardware and spreading the word that Wright is the real deal.
Stay tuned!

The best practice would have been to create a new paper wallet when moving your coins back from coinbase. That way, it would be impossible for electrum to store the private key, even inadvertently. Using a hardware wallet would accomplish the same thing.

My understanding is that for this attack vector to be effective, a paper wallet with a weak seed has to be reused (ie. spent from) at least once to leak enough information to exploit a potential randomness problem.
Otherwise, if single-use paper wallets from bitaddress were easily guessable they would have all been swept by thieves long ago.

Sorry to hear that. I suspect their partner bank has suspended your account due to KYC/AML request and Bitpay is not being honest about the source of the problem.

However, if the account was suspended due to suspicion of some sort of restricted activity, they may refuse to refund you and even be barred by law from telling you why.

I see what you're saying. But that's not what people are complaining about. "the mempool is full" means there are more transactions accumulating in the mempool than can be cleared by the blockchain in a reasonable amount of time, resulting in fee competition and high transaction fees.
Technically you're correct, but technically there is no "the mempool", only specific instances of a mempool.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:37:04
I agree, a model would be great. Even better would be some consensus on what conditions would indicate that a block size increase is needed at all. There must be some circumstance that would be deemed as unacceptable by a solid majority of the community. Transaction fees over $500 for a year? Mempool stuffed with 500k transactions and growing? If we could agree on a set of triggering conditions a lot of conflict could be removed from the community IMO. Instead, I often hear that blocksize increases will be considered "when they're needed" or "when bitcoin is ready for mainstream adoption". Those conditions are so subjective they are meaningless.

Excellent explanation, and entertainingly told!
That said, Mr. Billionnaire can attempt to create some momentum in the market with a big buy (or sell). Let's say he buys up enough bitcoin to push the price from $5000 to $6000. If he tries to sell immediately, he's going to lose money as described above. But he's hoping that the big spike will lead to a change in market sentiment that  will drive the price up even higher. He'll reinforce that narrative with shouts of "The bear market is over!" and "Don't miss the rocket ship to $10k!" If he's successful, he can slowly sell his coins back into the market and make a profit. Or, he can just wait until the order book of eager buyers is large enough that he can sell everything back at a net profit.

Despair is definitely in the air, but Bitcoin is not dead yet. You've been through the past corrections, so ask yourself, why are you feeling worse now than you did during the previous drops? Personally, this one is hitting me harder because the last rise to $20k was enough to really start imagining big life-changing stuff. Holders from 2011-2013 often have enough cheap coins from the early days that a $20k bitcoin could be enough to buy a house, travel the world, retire early, etc. Now, at $3.8k, many of those possibilities have disappeared. To make things worse, you didn't sell at the top so it's easy to blame yourself and question your own judgment. That's a recipe for self-doubt, anxiety, and depression.
My advice: try not to think of the BTC/FIAT exchange rate as a proxy for the true value of Bitcoin. There are a lot of big early adopters out there who can push the market down, and right now there are plenty of reasons for them to be selling. Bitmain may be dumping coins under pressure from the board as they push toward IPO. Ver/Wright/Ayre may be dumping BTC to prop up their side in the ongoing BCH/BSV war. There are likely some other larger players locking in losses to offset taxes from earlier gains. There are lots of reasons to sell that are driven by personal motives and don't reflect an underlying loss of confidence in Bitcoin.
Despair comes from looking backward at what might have been. Look forward and you'll see there are a lot of good things coming for Bitcoin and blockchain in the next few years.

I would be very happy with a slow, steady rise with enough time to get Lightning working for the masses and Schnorr and MAST integrated and functioning.
I could see big institutional money potentially spiking the price without flooding the chain to a standstill. That would be great for current investors, but also bad if it happens before there's a solid Layer 2 option for small transactions.

Let's agree that an action can be both a rational and an emotional response to something.
Let's further agree that a given "normal" person will not make decisions rationally 100% of the time, nor will they make them emotionally 100% of the time.
Let's also agree that between the two of us, we can both present examples of both rational and emotional decision-making in a normal person.
Finally, let's agree that in some situations, people may have differing opinions on whether or not a given action should be considered rational. Even when identical starting information is available, the desired outcome can influence whether or not something is judged as rational.
In my experience, when making decisions that are not purely reaction to environmental stimuli (run away from the maniac with the chainsaw), people often make emotional decisions, then try to convince themselves and others that the decision had a rational motivation after the fact. This is supported by a lot of sociological research and my own personal life experience.

You're correct, a penny is worth very little by itself and is easy to spend on a whim. Pennies can also add up to a meaningful amount when thousands or millions of people are spending them. Microtransactions make it possible to make large numbers of very small transactions that are impossible with credit cards or cash. This opens up use cases that do not exist today. Do you understand my logic?

Use cases for bitcoin are: storing value in a way that can be easily transported without being confiscated, making remote payments without a middleman or border restrictions, and making anonymous payments (if done with caution).
Additional use cases will become possible with the evolution and spread of Lightning, including making instant payments with a negligible fee, including micropayments that are not feasible with a credit card.
I think most typical, everyday people don't have much need for the first set of use cases, but the capabilities of Lightning will create a whole new class of payments that will see widespread use and drive the price of Bitcoin much higher.

Why do you keep bringing up Sergio? I'm not basing my statements on his claims. And yes, it is entirely plausible that Kleiman was doing more than 50% of the mining for the first year or so, and that would have gotten him over a million coins. The early bitcoin ran the CPU at 100% while mining bitcoins which were, at the time, completely worthless. Numerous accounts from early users tell the same tale: "I ran the client for a little while and got some bitcoins, then I shut it off because I didn't want to ruin my computer." Only Kleiman would have the motivation to keep mining because he was more invested in the idea than anyone else. And he was likely running it on several computers to make sure the network was working properly. That is entirely plausible.
Regarding the 1933 address I can only speculate. But CWS knew that since Dave was already dead he would never have to move those coins anywhere. He could have picked any sufficiently large wallet and claimed it was part of the stash.
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:33:58
The 1933... conflict is just one of four cited reasons that the documents are fraudulent. More importantly, Kleiman's signature is forged! Kleiman claims Wright admitted it! Why are you hung up on the address?
Regarding the 1mil BTC, some simple math shows how that amount is plausible. That's not numerology, it's mathematics. Learn the difference.

Great story, thanks for sharing! I contributed a paper wallet with $10 of BTC to our office White Elephant party Christmas of 2013. It's now worth $132, plus the value of the associated fork coins (BCH, BTG, etc.) The recipient still has the wallet and is a devoted HODL-er.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:02:07
I can't tell if you're deliberately misunderstanding what I'm saying, or if you really just don't want to hear it.
First, forget Sergio. I have not read Sergio. I'm not making any claims based on Sergio. He is not a part of this discussion.
I didn't claim that Kleiman was the sole miner of the Satoshi fortune, or that nobody else mined the blockchain while he was mining. I'm only saying that it is PLAUSIBLE that Kleiman, if he wrote the original bitcoin client, could have run it enough to amass a 1mil coin fortune. You have not disproved that claim in any way.
Furthermore, CSW clearly agreed, because be put considerable effort into defrauding Kleiman's estate out of that same fortune.
Regarding the 1933 address, I think we both agree that CSW does not control it. It's a piece of false data in a fraudulent contract. It only serves to prove the CSW is a fraud.
Let me clarify my original statement.
"If Ira Kleiman succeeds with this lawsuit, it will prove CSW is (part of) Satoshi and (part of) Satoshi is a crook."
Now that the suit has been filed, Kleiman can compel discovery via document requests, subpoenas, etc. and should be able to sort out the truth fairly quickly. If he's right, he'll win a multi-billion fortune. If he's wrong, he'll have to settle for revealing CSW's fraud to the world and likely sending him to jail for it.

I've found the best way to keep something valuable from being lost or thrown away is to treat it like it's valuable. Say you've got a seed phrase or paper wallet with some bitcoin. Treat it like you would an equivalent amount of cash or gold. Buy a good safe and store it inside. Keep it in a safety deposit box. Since a list of words isn't obviously valuable (like a gold bar), put your crypto info in an envelope with "VALUABLE CONTENTS INSIDE -- DO NOT DISCARD -- CONTACT &lt;YOURNAME&gt; FOR HELP" in big red letters on the outside.
Your aging parents or tech-ignorant wife may toss some random shit they find in an overstuffed filing cabinet or desk drawer, but they sure as hell won't casually discard something in their safe that says VALUABLE on the outside.

Problem is, regardless of miner efficiency, the difficulty adjustment ensures that the rate of creation of new bitcoin will always return to a set rate, currently 1800/day until the next halving. That means that even with the perfectly efficient miner you described, the market supply would still be increasing at the same rate. The profit margin for individual miners might change, but the overall market price would not be affected.

I love this concept! I will be doing all my orders via the API from now on. I saved 95% on a trade just this morning.
To counter a bit of misinformation, if you create an API key with the role of "Trader" you'll be able to buy and sell crypto but withdrawals are impossible. Even if someone stole your API keys they would not be able to steal your funds. They could place trades on your behalf, though, which would be bad.

Do the following and you should be fine:
* keep track of when you got the bitcoin you're selling, from where, and how much you paid
* report and pay capital gains tax on whatever profit you made
* don't sell someone else's bitcoin on their behalf
* don't sell to anyone who mentions drugs, guns, terrorism, or anything illegal
Final word of advice. If you're meeting someone in person to do these sales, they may be building your confidence with the small sales to scam you on the large one. If you're transferring via bank, be aware that your bank is required to report 10k+ transactions to the IRS.

All crypto transactions have three central metrics: Fast, Secure, and Cheap. Bitcoin is always secure, and depending on the transaction fee you set it can also be fast or cheap. But it will only rarely be both fast and cheap.

OMG, this all makes so much sense.
CSW's threats and erratic behavior were designed to bait Ver and friends into taking unilateral action to defend against an attack that never came. The real goal was to get them to act out of fear and then file a lawsuit through a third-party proxy company. Wright only had to depress the price of BCH and then blame it on Ver and his allies.
Ver and Wu will try to have the suit thrown out, and then countersue to try and prove that Wright's threats were a deliberate act of sabotage. Wright and his allies love lawsuits and will try to tie everyone up in the courts until Bitmain goes bankrupt (unable to raise funds with an active lawsuit ongoing) and Ver surrenders.
This might actually be good for Bitcoin, as none of the parties involved in BCH forks will be able to manipulate the markets while the suits are active. Short term, we're probably looking at another massive drop and the market gets word of this lawsuit, which will be seen as a critical legal test for all blockchains.

Simple, don't install you wallet through an app store -- download the apk (for Android) directly from the app maker instead. Then it won't auto update or get dropped from your phone if the're a hacked app update or the app gets banner from the store.
I use this approach for a storage wallet installed on a spare phone. You could call it a "cool" wallet. It's a recent android phone with the sim card removed and no associated Google account. The wallet app is downloaded from a secure desktop computer then transferred to the phone by USB cable and installed. Nothing auto updates and I have a backup of the app install file if I need to replace the phone.
The best part is, you can get a subsidized cell phone at low cost and just never activate the cell service.

You want to be able to move money into and out of bitcoin without moving the price around too much. Imagine you want to send $50k to your bro in Australia. If Bitcoin is trading at 10 cents each, buying $50k will push the price way up, then it will plunge when he sells it later. If Bitcoin is trading at $25k each, buying and selling $50k worth won't move the market at all.

Way too complicated. Buy and use a Ledger. 
For cold storage for the truly cheap, get an old Android phone, pull the SIM card, do a factory reset, copy over the APK for your favorite wallet and install. Delete all the bloatware and don't connect a google account. Keep the seed phrase backed up somewhere else on paper. Turn the cold storage phone off when not in use and keep it locked up.
Even cheaper: print a bunch of paper wallets from a local copy of [bitaddress.org]( Keep a second copy somewhere safe. Send your storage bitcoins to these wallets in reasonable chunks. If you need the funds, grab a paper wallet and sweep it to your hot wallet for use. You can also use Mycelium to sweep a partial amount of funds with the rest being sent back to the paper wallet automatically.
