This is a clear power trip in my eyes. Because Someone is standing up to them, they just ban/mute to silence you because they can't handle it.

I guess so.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:28:44
Right, but the rules specifically state thats its ONLY okay to to share your btc address if someone asks you to.. why does that make sense? it should be a never....
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:23:29
Yeah, Thats what the other mod said. I didnt know it wasn't allowed. But it doesn't make any sense why its not allowed. Because if someone asks you to post it. its now all of a sudden okay? How does that make sense?
I could literally log on my alt account - post a comment saying "whats ur btc address" then all of a sudden everything is handy dandy. That makes 0 sense.
and even so, they could of deleted the post - then messaged me and said "hey, please dont post your btc address"  but instead i get insta muted....

Well I just feel these guys have been directly being an asshole to me because I called them out on their power trip, and they didn't like it. Typically when I messaged the mods, I get responded to within minutes. This time when I sent a message I got muted.

I wonder if bcashers still think bcash is better and LN is a scam. Or if we need LN tokens or whatever the f7ck they be talking about. Any bcash supporters here can fud this so I can see the other side?
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:40:55
I thought you weren't a bcash supporter. Lmfao. Lying duck.

Yep. I trust them. That's why I use the ledger hardware wallet. Seems legit. Hope it is. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 00:31:26
What do you mean nope? You said you hope you trust them. I said i do. You say nope?

Personally 450 into ltc in anticipation for the big double its gonna hit here (soon) and the rest into btc.

Its not too late. Look, itll be too late when everyone walking around knows what the shit is. Buy now and hodl. Also diversify. Dont put all yoyr eggs in 1 basket. Look at ltc and eth.

The fee as income was a good addition. And I have like $50 worth in that thing. And I havent used it since last dec. Lol.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:57:41
Reasons for what exactly? The ltc price bump?
Ill be honest. Im new here so im not 100% sure why. But general consensus is that sometime before yhe new year ltc will double up in value. Something about charlie lee working fulltime and something about a new lightning network. Thats why. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:14:41
Why do you have faith in bloch chain? Im new here.

@_date: 2017-11-27 13:36:53

@_date: 2017-11-27 13:50:40
LOL never heard thst before. I'll be sure it use it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:36:36
I think they could of atleast been like, look dude, you're new. Alot of new people are joining. Please dont post unless someone asks you 2. That would of worked too and everyone could of been happy.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:54:31
I did. Did u read this thread? I explained myself 3 times to the mod. And he just wasn't havin it 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:41:02
this is a great question. because although i know you're not supposed to trade in usd value and satoshi only. i really could use the help getting started seeing satoshi in usd value. cause when i see something priced at 0.00750269 i have no idea what the shit says...

What you do is use ur credit card. Charge 500. Put into btc. Waot btc to reise 500. Sell it. Pay off the 500 and keep the other. Will take like 3 days.
