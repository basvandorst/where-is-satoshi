 Thanks for confirming the sell signal. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:45:20
I’m just a mountain climber.  Others are more like Alex Honnold.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:15:38
It’s not infinite and not worth discussing.  No one would argue there are infinite US Dollars in circulation, electronic or otherwise. Might be a language issue or semantics issue.
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:32:09
I’m long from 6520.  Hodling.
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:20:22
Could happen if 6500 breaks up.
I flipped long.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:25:36
Many folks who support BTC would love to see it take over as the world currency.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:52:46
15-30 years of sideways bonds, eventual rally like 1982 cycle.  Race to the bottom happened already.
BTC can have its place amongst the libertarian crowd all the meanwhile, whether it stabilizes or goes to moon, or fails to store value long term.
Pending CME approval and then adoption, path is that Wall Street will extract more fiat out of BTC than hodlers.  Like how they relieved gold hodlers of their fiat gains.  Gold was supposed to go to moon too.
Powerful folks have more info than hodlers.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:05:08
Some of these price projections would be difficult to achieve up against military backed currencies.
If the goal is to run the world on BTC then it needs to power government(s), too.  That’s the reason for my question.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:22:19
I posted a chart showing clearly were at the top of the mountain. It is plain as day that we are at the top now. Anyone can open their website and view the chart for themselves.
Besides, other people here have already posted helpful charts that show the story. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:54:03
You can buy your BTC back way lower if that’s your concern.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:34:15
Flipped short at 6,580
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:02:56
This musical chairs pig is toppy as a mofo. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:44:02
I asked OP a question about deflationary fixed supply unseizable currency running a country.
USD isn’t infinite.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:02:27
Hang tight, phriend.
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:09:32
Sounds like you’ve got some purpose in life.  Good on you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:05:42
 HODL if you disagree 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:15:16
Just an English issue bro.  It’s not infinite.  What you’re trying to say is there seems to be unchecked printing.
If anything in the optimistic scenario I could see BTC’s rise being the catalyst for monetary contraction and a bond bubble deflation.
Read up on Ray Dalio.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:16:18
 What credibility do most of the posters here have? Not much. 
The reason it seems to be garbage to you is because all you see is up up up. 
I’m here to tell you that it’s a good time to sell. Credibility or not. For what it’s worth. 
You are free to make your own call if it appears that we are at the top of a mountain right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:19:54
 Give it about a month and your heads going to be spinning so fucking fast bro. You and the rest of the late comers. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:25:18
At least in the case of the United States dollar, it is absolutely not infinite. 
I am interested to hear how you believe that bitcoin will power a government. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:42:01
Perhaps, but governments would rather not take a chance.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:55:03
Bitcoin exchange is foreign to many.  They don’t see a monthly chart that whipsaws on the next bar.
Imagine that, dropping like a rock to a fraction of 6k from up here, all by years end.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:09:08
CME futures for instance.
Plunge protection team but for gold and now BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:00:24
Derivatives.  Those you know about and those you don’t, my friend.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:16:29
Laying it all on the line, pal.  If I lose I’ll only return in spirit.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:53:28
All you need is good info...
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:28:29
And, we are off to the races!  In an early lead is sell 6,400!
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:38:44
Looks so rosy at the top.  Oh so lovely up here.  Obviously hodlers can’t see the other side of the mountain from this side of the peak. Bwhahahahaha!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:11:00
No, governments are a good thing and help protect you.
In the United States for instance, banks are insured.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:08:01
If you knew someone was overleveraged by many millions and could move the market in favor of your core positions with your derivatives muscle, what would you do?
What people don’t realize is how big money staked a claim into BTC long ago. The rise is artificial.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:43:56
That’s diversification, not hedging.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:08:24
Ok. May I ask what’s your hodl fiat basis?  In other words at what point or for how much did you acquire your coin?
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:17:59
So, BTC’s design is anarchy even more than cash.  And we phased out cash largely long ago (but allow *some* cash, which tells you something about the fate of BTC).
If you believe BTC will take over anything from the West OR the East, you got another thing coming.  The fundamentals suck at scale.  And I’m not talking about BTC’s petty tech shortcomings nor irresponsible use of energy, either.
Cute social experiment, though.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:42:14
Minority Report: “Can you seeee?”
Yes, yes, big money can, in fact, see clearly.  March of the pigs, indeed.  Wake up time, people.  Your tenth life generally consists of a prayer bounce.
Good luck picking the top, investors.  Hodlers rejoice.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:36:50
I’m a seller to 6,500, Mr. Hodl.
November will be ugly.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:53:52
What’s your hodl fiat basis, in other words when or at what price did you acquire your coins?
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:38:27
The CME news. And If you read about it here it’s not a rumor.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:30:32
What’s the dark web? Is that like a libertarian thing fueled by pseudo-anonymous digital cryptocurrencies and a decentralized network of onions?
Is it just “running a website” when people die from the poison that your website peddled, while you made millions in potentially unseizable funds?
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:16:26
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:45:50
The best part is that most people are so obstinate, they don’t recognize when info that could help them greatly comes along.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:13:59
If so I will be dead inside a week.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:20:28
I was buds with the father in law of a Morgan Stanley exec before he (the father) passed.
Agree that BTC will decline from here.
The masters of the universe are being so nice letting you know their stance and giving you time to reconsider..
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:50:19
Nah it’s obviously time to sell now.
Where you going? Get back in there and sell! Sell!
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:02:57
Confirmed, libertarian alert!  Rude and unnecessarily offensive, at that!
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:54:12
No sellers huh???? C’mon hodlers keep on hodling because it’s blue skies for now!! 
This place is funny.  Some smart folks but lots of sheep.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:58:40
Sounds like you tried making a prediction about $450 and didn’t take action since then.
I’m talking about hodling but using info from friends to offset the hodl in order to weather the declines, like the one starting this week.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:37:35
Governments will intervene to subdue BTC’s price, similar to gold.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:55:16
Suggesting to hodl and hedge.  Both.  Offset hodl with a short position for instance.
If only you knew when BTC was going to fall, eh?
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:13:26
Anyway I’ll keep selling for the next 48 hours and if we don’t turn by then I’ll be dead!
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:12:04
Futures are bad news.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:56:54
No delivery! “Cash settled”.
In other words, weapons of mass financial destruction.
Wealth transfer thus will be potentially far greater for the bank/finance crowd than for actual BTC.  In other words, they will still be rich.
Where there’s a will, there’s a way.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:11:41
Turn will be evident in hindsight.  Happening now end of month. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:57:31
 What do you think I’m trading? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:52:01
The price is backed by buyers and sellers.  The network itself is backed by inefficient consensus efforts.
Consider this: big money uses derivatives to pump the price so high that it gathers huge interest.  Tank price to shake the tree.
If you think this can’t happen going forward, please reconsider.  The Wild West nature compared to efficient and highly regulated stock exchanges has attracted skilled predators.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:40:11
Please read the question fully.  If your BTC hedge fund buddies told you the 6k price is artificially high and was going to drop, would you consider hedging if not selling?
Hodl and hedge with derivatives.  Enhanced hodling.
Hedging isn’t selling your coins.  It’s for protecting against the forthcoming downside.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:24:02
I’m a seller to 6,500.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:30:04
Catching a well-timed short is rewarding but ultimately luck.  Being wrong quickly isn’t for hodlers.  Hodlers are right.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:44:11
Never know when you’ll learn something.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:27:34
We can check back in once we are below 6k.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:56:22
Hahahahaha, I bring prime rib eye to carnivorous anarchists and get downvoted!!! Bwahahahahaha!!
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:43:36
It’s my funeral not yours if I’m wrong!  The real moves happen outside of public view, for now.  It’s just paper.  That is until CME takes over.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:40:00
I’ve been selling for days now.  Thing is, paper already exists. Just not on your desk.
The CME news is just the beginning of the end.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:57:52
Same for any other trade. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:05:23
So, you’re going to hodl even after we break below 6k.  Cool.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:31:32
Clever folks, those Russians.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:19:17
I will sell higher. But topping here at 6,400 would be far from unanticipated.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:31:15
Not exactly a hedge for me.  I’m just enlightening the peanut gallery.
Selling to 6,500, like this: Sell 6,100, 6,200, 6,300, 6,400, 6,500.
Even a true hodler can do it, with derivatives, anyway. Hence, this post.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:57:17
That’s right baby keep crying about it!   I have stated in advance that I am short to 6500.
Geesh man at least give the idea time to play out! 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:38:07
OP is talking about a BTC crash.  There’s precedent for this.
Things always look the rosiest at the extreme.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:17:01
Gotta balance out with hodl cheerleaders.  Just wait till CME gets involved.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:20:35
I will be self terminating if my trade is wrong.  So I will actually “go away”, possibly.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:50:39
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:42:22
Contrarian reality check in the face of bad news with regard to CME announcement.
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:49:16
Just kidding, got your attention.  You should not trade, hodler.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:46:13
Hodlers should make a monument in me for adding fuel to the fire, after I kill myself next week.
Hey, someone has to step in front of a freight train.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:00:15
I’m speaking to the fact that BTC and cash work entirely on possession.  No insurance etc.  Both fail the $5 wrench test.
Like it or not, governments protecting your savings are a good thing.  This isn’t compatible with BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:03:08
It’s to offset your hodl.  You don’t have to be net short nor fully offset your hodl position.
And yes it’s not for an amateur.  If only you knew, in advance, that the price would tank by coordinated selling...
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:14:25
Objectively it means BTC’s price will be held down permanently.
That’s how gold is controlled.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:56:55
I bet my life we are topping now (as a monster life-changing trade, not some permament thesis yet).
No, I won’t live stream the suicide.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:30:40
“It’s buy futures sell futures when there *is* no future!”
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:31:59
So, it’s covered by an ad, but the bottom from this view is just below a thousand.  Almost like a hint from Above, or in this instance, Below.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:28:03
Already done so.  You may not be aware of the origin of BTC nor the intent.  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:34:13
The mentality you convey is too radical for most folks.
The tech has wonderful attributes, but has limitations.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:26:13
True.  However price moves on buying vs selling pressure, and even more so once derivatives and big money get involved.
I’m interested in the short to medium term price of bitcoin, and as you pointed out, the fundamentals are unclear.
An investor who holds their keys can use a derivative like futures which offer delta to hedge when it makes sense.  Think of it as being a hodler on steroids. Pump and dump leverage and hodl.
Key is to understand such cycles and how big players conspire to keep the little guy as late as possible.  Of course when a fish gets gobbled to the tune of $50MM you get an idea of how the game works.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:24:53
Sounds quite reasonable, friend.  Trust, but verify as a BlackRock analyst told me once.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:17:34
BTC was designed to be politically subversive.  Wages aren’t changing.  Inequality and wealth concentration are related but distinct problems, ones that BTC can’t solve for late adoptors, should it go to a million.  
Not many people have six grand to invest long enough to hope for a million dollar bitcoin.  At that level you’d have ridiculous wealth concentration and no social issues solved at scale.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:21:57
Folks tuned in at the ATH.  Presumably the defecation adoption rates are in line with the degree to which we are seeing a derivative pumped price.  Nope, no chance the masters own BTC price.  No, sir.
As for BTC, just giving a clue regarding likelihood of adoption at levels needed to achieve the percentage growth from here that folks are projecting.
BTC fits with radical ideology.
Interested in your counterpoints.  Thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:22:57
“Cryptos” =/= BTC
We got a wannabe hodler projecting his lambo dreams!
Anyway all I’m saying is: BTC price is headed south now.
