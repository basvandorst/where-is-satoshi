Thanks, I appreciate the detailed response

It's called technical analysis and there's plenty of courses on YouTube. Personally I've been watching YourTradingCoach, it won't teach you everything but I think it's a good start depending on your current knowledge

I don't think you even know what your point is

Got in for the profit, stayed for the profit. What's a bitcoin?

My friend was sent some bitcoin back in 2013/2014 but he can't remember where it is. Can anyone list a few popular wallets at that time or likely places that it would be?

Which ones would you put in the 1%?

£: bank &gt; coinbase &gt; gdax
€: bank &gt; revolut &gt; coinbase &gt; gdax
I prefer the second method for a few reasons:
 
A: revolut allows me to make SEPA transfers which are the cheapest option (0.15c flat fee from coinbase)
B: euro has more currency pairs on gdax
Only downside is that it takes 2-3 days to move the money

Is my analysis off or are all the top coins in a pennant right now? (Except ETH)
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:33:15
Gdax has 0 fees if you use stop and limit orders

Is this dip really anything except for whales constantly manipulating the price? If you check BTC/USD on GDAX there are non-stop fake buy/sell walls, probably the same elsewhere
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:06:21
Half and half

25%, had to give one of the kids to coinbase

Im using GDAX from the UK. Have you got a coinbase account? As far as I know, if you have a coinbase account, you have a GDAX account.

Check out Steemit. It's like Reddit but your upvotes generate currency

Much longer than that I think, hodling regardless

Lambos are technology. Right?
