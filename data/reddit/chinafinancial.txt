Just use a different port.
"They" can't block all ports. :) 
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:19:14
Possibilities are there... but only time will tell.
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:41:43
Blocksize limit is an innovation?
@_date: 2015-06-29 08:29:22
Cool, and I'm glad that I've found this lifeboat earlier on. :)
@_date: 2015-06-27 08:34:12
A relatively stable price is good for long term bitcoin development :)
@_date: 2015-06-19 07:15:35
The supply of btc will still exist. There are always people want to trade their coins in the open markets. 
You will just end up paying a lot more when the btc value goes up significantly.
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:34:59
Strange. I have no problem visiting blockchain.info now... Are you sure you are visiting the correct site?
@_date: 2015-06-05 10:07:19
Oh yes, I heard about it too. Thanks for sharing it here anyway :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:05:35
Wish more people understand it and we'll have more full nodes :)
@_date: 2015-06-26 08:18:18
Register a changetip account first.
Answers to your questions can be found easily there :)
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:38:47
Thanks for your efforts :) But normally I don't download files from unknown source.
@_date: 2015-06-24 11:21:09
Who is Hidden Hand?
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:15:10
I doubt if there is any accurate source about the exact number of people who "know" something. ;)
@_date: 2015-06-22 11:48:12
May I know how much you gonna pay for sharing an article?
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:15:56
Did you receive an email for you to approve this withdrawal?
Check your junk emails if you did not see it.
@_date: 2015-06-28 07:33:25
That's fine.. Let's just forgive them :)
@_date: 2015-06-23 10:50:04
Why you need all these data?
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:29:55
I think you can run a script to automate this.
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:27:32
I'd like to see the client to be SPV by default (good for newbies), and allows custom setting to change it to full node mode.
@_date: 2014-11-23 04:43:26
Nope. Bitcoin is real. You can buy stuff with Bitcoin and many shops are accepting it. That's real money.
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:19:58
Thanks for your sharing. I must say I agree that a decentralized bitcoin exchange should be our future, and I strongly believe we don't need to wait too long for it.
Cheers :)
@_date: 2014-12-30 01:33:14
I'd suggest you keep it your own first. As the price rises one day it will be able to help more people.
@_date: 2014-12-12 06:01:24
It will bring more new people into the Bitcoin world
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:04:49
Congrats but too bad non-MIT students cannot join :(
Anyway I suggest you to just try buy something with btc. It will help spread the use of this wonderful crypto.
@_date: 2015-05-17 08:19:37
There are already some other existing technologies to prevent this, such as installing an alarm or a CCTV.
@_date: 2014-12-25 02:22:40
Merry Christmas to all! Enjoy your holidays!
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:32:09
Great job! Thanks for setting it up and supporting Electrum.
@_date: 2014-11-21 12:52:40
Startups investors? Let's wait to see if they can really earn some money out of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:29:03
For Linux distro, I think Ubuntu is good enough. I am also using Ubuntu to store my coins.
@_date: 2015-05-11 03:51:10
Bad idea. So if you had some dollars unspent for some years then your money should be taken away?
@_date: 2015-05-03 05:36:26
You may also consider to help other webmasters you may know to set up on their websites to accept Bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2015-05-16 19:21:54
I think it's a good idea. It will make the lock as secure as the Bitcoin address(es) you own.
@_date: 2015-05-13 04:39:29
Congrats! You're so lucky. :)
@_date: 2015-05-19 08:47:22
I believe $1 per paper wallet will be good enough.
Wish your presentation a great success!
@_date: 2014-12-25 02:17:53
Hello and Merry Christmas to all!
@_date: 2015-05-04 04:54:06
The dollar was originally backed up by Gold. Now it's basically backed up by nothing. It was a ridiculous innovation.
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:44:41
Oh that makes more sense now but maybe you need to rephase your title a bit :)
@_date: 2015-01-24 03:05:03
Even Lehman brothers ELN could get approved, you don't need to worry anything Wall Street can't make it happen if they want to. :)
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:12:00
Congrats to McGill University students.
I hope I could be one of them :(
@_date: 2015-01-19 03:14:48
Just ask if anyone ever earned from MN and you'll know :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:57:34
Price crash is real. For most people who still believe in Bitcoin, that's no fun.
@_date: 2015-01-16 03:34:40
Bitcoin doesn't need a central bank. That's all.
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:37:35
Ask the support again. There is no reason why they only steal one of your miners. They are supposed to steal all of them :)
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:24:16
I've just received the same email message from Adfly too.
Not bad to have one more payout options :)
@_date: 2015-01-20 08:08:30
How about MultiBit? I just heard that they start charging fees coz they can't maintain it free of charge.
@_date: 2015-05-20 07:40:20
So do you think more banks will follow?
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:54:46
No hurry. If you just want to do it for learning, you may consider to start with some altcoins with low difficulties. Some can still be mined with even GPU and then you will know exactly how mining works. 
After that you can decide if you still want to invest your money into Bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2014-12-25 08:40:12
Happy holidays and thanks
@_date: 2015-01-23 12:49:02
Hold your coins. Wall street is coming...
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:01:04
No worries. 
Everyone is already aware of this Black Friday.
Nothing big will happen today coz nobody panic this time :)
@_date: 2015-07-16 09:41:38
I had similar issue before and then don't use it again. Too bad they still don't get it fixed.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:08:29
Nice site but it seems it can't handle big traffic.
Need higher speed servers. :)
@_date: 2015-07-23 11:09:07
No one organizes and pays for the ads fee.
@_date: 2015-07-17 08:27:45
Just run it on a computer with port 8333 opened, with a large harddisk and with a stable internet connection. :)
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:23:33
Interesting. That is why we are different. :)
@_date: 2015-07-02 06:43:58
No regret, no matter how much I am holding.
@_date: 2015-07-01 05:57:58
THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:48:07
Ok, good to see Bitcoin thief cannot escape in the real world.
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:59:02
Guys, do you think will really come to answer these questions?
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:21:14
@_date: 2015-04-13 06:55:29
Bitcoin is exactly designed to address your concern. Governments cannot kill peer-to-peer connections.
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:42:20
I will change to accept payments in Bitcoin if Google adsense allows.
@_date: 2015-04-19 04:28:42
I suggest you gave more time for people to prepare. Maybe more people will be interested to join. :)
@_date: 2015-04-14 02:57:25
I used coinbase before and it looked good to me.
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:18:15
$1.5 million to build a forum? Crypto world is crazy lol.
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:56:18
Go to bitcoin core console. Dump all private keys. 
Then import all private keys to Multibit. 
That's it. No need to pay any tx fee. :)
But remember to always backup all private keys in case you mess up something.
@_date: 2015-04-12 09:33:14
Yes agree I love this community too!
@_date: 2015-04-05 12:36:11
Thanks for explanations. It does help me better understand the current gihub status.
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:45:58
I don't know coz these people possibly didn't post their stories publicly. But I think if they are really passionate with Bitcoin, they should come back to buy at current low price with the money they earned at the peak of $1000.
@_date: 2015-03-01 10:13:02
Not a bad idea. Let's do it together.
@_date: 2015-02-18 15:33:58
Great presentation. Really good for MIT students.
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:06:28
Before they even consider using Bitcoin, I hope they can do more to control their debts first.
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:32:54
Funny question :) 
Even if you could mine you'd only mine on a different blockchain (fork).
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:19:00
I love bitcoin because bitcoin never refuses my dating requests and I spent my whole Valentine's Day with bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:08:10
No worry, maybe you could sell at 44k the next day :)
@_date: 2015-02-04 07:01:41
I guess less than 1% now so there is still much room to increase the percentage :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:20:15
He may be thinking of writing about "Crypto Wars" soon :)
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:16:47
I still can't stop laughing :)
@_date: 2015-02-21 13:45:52
Thanks and this is just awesome :)
@_date: 2015-02-12 10:01:35
99.9% dice, 100% scam, 100.1% agree. :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:09:50
Thanks. May I know what's the benefit of making your tips private? :)
