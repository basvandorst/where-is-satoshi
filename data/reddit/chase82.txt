Amazon.ca is a pile of shit. Not that I order from Overstock either.

Prices are generally higher, selection isn't typically great, etc. It's good for DVDs and some stuff but doesn't even compare to US version.
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:43:57
Amazon.ca is often a higher price than other Canadian Retailers.
Example: [The first 50" TV I saw listed on Amazon.ca]( and [at a local brick and mortar](
Edit: Actually that was a bad example, if I added it to cart through amazon it's $20 cheaper

As someone who tried bitcoin commerce, only to get ripped off. I'd say this is a necessity if you actually want to use it for an internet payment system.

Happens every few days. Some hacker types try to drive the price down with DDoS attacks. It gets a bit rocky for a bit but should pass in a half hour or so.

I've been following BTC for about a week now. I was just glad to see it get propped up like that on a panic sell. Being such a tiny exchange with a very limited cap I was a little iffy until I saw how it reacted. Whether or not that was a bear trap or just people's buys catching it on the way down I don't know. Either way it seemed to find a pretty solid bottom around low 60s. 
I'm going to start buying in now as this is just starting to get interesting. The amount of interest is exploding and there's a finite number of BTCs.

How about an [Apple](
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:12:46
I thought CAVirtex fees seemed unreasonable. 
The low volume is interesting on liberty bit as newcomers seem eager to buy and you see some crazy trades once in awhile.
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:32:57
When I ordered I couldn't find anything on these guys. I really didn't do my due diligence though. I saw the paying with BIPS thing and thought it might provide some level of comfort. Clearly I was wrong.
At least now when you search for "bitcoinvalley scam" you get a few hits. Hopefully save some other people some grief.

I've been using liberty bit. I don't have much to compare it to but seems good so far. Definitely smaller and not much liquidity yet but i like the EMT option and 0.5% fee

I seriously am not. That kinda was the point.
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:19:31
It's only stable on low volume. Buyers trying to get it for cheap and sellers holding out. This is oddly cyclic

Looks like they ddos Mt. Gox and throw in massive sells while people can't adjust their orders in attempts to drive the price down. They flush out weak hands that way. I might be a bit off. 
People are getting used to it though so the impact is getting less. If you see a massive drop every four days or so don't sweat it. Things settle out in an hour or two.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:14:56
Not much you can do but see where the dust settles. This is bad for a lot of people selling off and is going to create a lot of bad press for BTC.
It's not like MtGox didn't have fair warning.
