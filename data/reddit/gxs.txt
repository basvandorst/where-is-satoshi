wow what a freaking joke. It's completely locked me out. I will find a way to hold them accountable. Guaranteed.

It's been doing this for 3-4 days. Crash then somewhat recovers. Crash then somewhat recovers. Each time it stays lower than the last. That is no longer a correction, it is steady decline. For me personally, I've tripled my money, I want to get out but coinbase won't allow it.

Obviously my actions don't matter to anyone. The point of posting in a forum like this is to spur discussion. No one cares about your comment either, for that matter. If you don't have anything to contribute, simply move on. Why is that so hard?

For sure man, I feel you.
I'm playing with the house's money at the moment so I'm not sweating it.
I'm just thinking, why not sell right now, then buy back during the next dip? If it starts to climb again, I can buy back in, losing only on the profits I've made so far.

Oh wow, you're cool. Internet tough guy everyone! woohooo!!

It's hard to laugh when the only reason you can't cash out after tripling your money is because Coinbase sucks. It counted all my failed log in attempts while it was down and now says I exceeded the limit. 
Hard to laugh.

Already sold what I allocated to sell, sorry!

I'm pretty calm. Fortunately this is money I can afford to lose. I'm just pissed off the same way that I was when I was booted off a flight for no reason and the next 3 flights were full.
It's just super shady on their part. I ended up emailing every exec I could and getting a refund on top of a free ticket. I will find a way to get even with coinbase as well.

Cool man, thanks. Will do. Didn't know about these.

Unless the email of money turns out to be a different implementation..
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:26:46
Yeah, that's exactly what happened. I tried logging in maybe 5-6 times while it was down. I can't imagine that hit the limit. But the page did timeout like a million times, so all those failed attempts were still counted as attempts.

this is ridiculous though, it's finally back up but it wont let me login. Know who could at least reset the counter so I can login?!?? I've been trying to log in for over an hour

I agree, it makes a difference and I definitely meant about a year.

Your reply isn't really conducive to good conversation. I was bringing it up in hopes of someone smarter than I would share some insight I may have missed. I don't see how your comment contributes. I guess mine doesn't either, but hey I tried.
