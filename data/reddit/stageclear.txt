Can you deposit Canadian funds yet? I know you have CDN listed in the trade options, but can you actually deposit &amp; withdraw CDN? 
Love the community outreach you guys at VoS constantly do. Most transparent exchange out there.

Investing at 5% interest a year and that's 15k on $300,000. If played smart you could easily live off interest and maybe working part time. You won't be a high roller, but that kind of money would change your life for sure. It would mine at least.

Why would someone sell such a tool for 100 BTC when they could use said tool to steal 7000x that amount through malleability themselves? Not doubting the listing, but was it a scam or did the tool really work? Would be interesting to see any forum posts related to this.

You don't lose unless you sell. You'll be fine after this all dies down.

Down to 7,700 BTC &amp; 4.5 million. Taking a very long time to eat through it but looks like this whale wants out for real.
