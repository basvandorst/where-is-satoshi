Don't turn off your computer, run bitcoin client and wait for about 2weeks for your node to fully synchronize about 70GB of blockchain data, then you will see your transaction in your bitcoin balance.
You can check your bitcoin balance here    (change Bitcoin address "1H0...Cun" with yours)

Settlement system becomes too expensive for daily usage (transaction fee will grow because of 1MB blocksize limit and more users/transactions in a long run). Settlement system is ideal for Lighning Network and payment services like BitPay and Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-04-25 14:46:05


You can't mine two blocks in parallel because you mine: **previous block hash** + transactions + nounce.
@_date: 2016-04-25 15:00:45
Ok, I see you are talking about hard fork. I think it is easier to completely remove blocksize limit with HF (set max to 32MB/block). Then miners will decide based on transaction fee which transactions will be included in next block and how many transactions goes into one block. It is easy for miners to detect spam transactions and calculate appropriate tx fee.
@_date: 2016-04-04 20:15:44
Some people are really angry about Bitcoin is becoming settlement system. Bitcoin can easily scale onchain. I wold rather see 2MB blocksize increase and that means more time for core to develop lighning network.

Not going to fail tomorrow, but in a long run.
$0.06 transaction fee seem low. If I buy something for $1, $0.06 is 6% transaction fee. Banks can do it cheaper than that. If block size limit stays the same, then transaction fee will rise.

There is nothing wrong with paying transaction fee. Question is: How big is going to be transaction fee if 100M users adopt Bitcon and we have 1MB block size limit?
We need to slowly increase block size limit in BIP101 predictable growth to scale users and use LN to scale nubmer of transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-04 11:08:31
11 cents seems little for large transactions. But paying $1 and 11cents that is 11% fee. Cap on blocksize limit means number of transactions can not rise only fee can rise to the point Bitcoin becomes too expensive and people will move to alts. LN and increased block limit to the rescue.
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:30:03
The number of bitcoins generated per block is set to decrease geometrically, with a 50% reduction every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years.


Miners does not create coins. Miners validate transactions and get reward for that.

No. If hashrate is dropped to 10%, then time between mined block goes from 10minutes to 100minutes. Difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks, this means 134days to lower difficulty. Transaction fee will rise by 10x. Consider this + transaction flood and we got caos. Daily traders will dump coins and price will drop.

I was told Lightning Network can only scale number of transactions and it can not scale number of users without increasing block size limit. Is this true?
Edit: If we want Visa tps we need to increase block limit(BIP101 style) to scale users and use LN to scale transactions. This can be win/win solution.

Bitcoin client can easily be changed to listen on port 80 or 443 in the future. Or you can use VPN to another Bitcoin friendly country.


Then we can use ssl and ISP cant detect bitcoin traffic.

Every service using Bitcoin is welcome. Bitcoin adoption grows and we all win...
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:46:57
If demand stays at the same level and supply dropped then price will rise. When price is rising demand could rise too because people want to invest more and not to miss a train. Regular people are not daily traders and when they see price is rising for 2 months in a row everyone wants to join and this is how they create a price bubble. Beware there is a lot of price speculation and manipulation. Market is illiquid and whales can easily move price up/down direction they want.

This is democracy. Everyone can run any version of Bitcoin node and vote with Hashpower, but majority will win.


HF will happen only if 750 out of 1000 last minded blocks came from classic miners. This means almost everyone is running classic and HF is safe to happen. This scenario looks impossible just for now - classic blocks 60/1000 or 6%. You have nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2016-03-31 19:46:03
He is right. Bitcoin will spread across the world like a virus when it comes to mass adoption. If you call it Bitcoin virus or Bitcoin node, I want to have one installed on my computer and support p2p Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:36:57
Makes sense, more people can use Bitcoin but this is not enough, please do some calculations. If we want Visa tps we need to increase block limit to scale users and use LN to scale transactions. This is win/win solution.
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:21:56


That is explanation for "LN can scale number of transactions". I can easily send fractions of bitcoin to different Bitcoin addresses without on-chain. This is where LN is good at, number of transactions can scale. I agree.


If I understand correctly, lockings happens when users send bitcoins to Lightning Network? This is where LN can not scale beacuse of a block limit. If more new users came in to transact, there is not enought room for onchain lockings or transaction fee must rise drastically. This is where I was told LN can not scale without increasing block size limit.

You are betting 1.6 GH/s against 1,132,755,039 GH/s. Better join minig pool and collect a few bits. 
Or start new premined alt and convince some people to use it, you will have better ROI.

DDoS is temporary thing. I'll wait for a fwe weeks and then open inbound port 8333. I dint mind to get ddossed once per week, but thid ddoss on classic nodes was too ofensive.
@_date: 2016-03-04 07:38:12


This makes sense.


If block limit doesn't grow then transaction fee will grow. Storing bitcoins in a block chain will cost you $100-$1000 in fees. I don't think anyone would want store bitcoins in block chain for that price. That means everyone will use LN and not be in a possession of bitcoins. 
I still think we should slowly increase block size limit in BIP101 predictable growth and use LN, thinking in a long term...
Thank you for your answers.

@_date: 2016-03-03 20:47:56
I agree. But for now it looks like we are going into the wrong direction. First we need to make consensus... rise block limit to 2MB, this will satisfy classic people and give core enough tome to develop LN. Then we need BIP101 slow predictable blocksize growth and more and more people using LN. This will get us slowly to visa tps.

Worst Case Growth Scenarios:
... Miners wish to maximize the sum of transaction fees paid for blocks they mine, while at the same time keep individual transaction fees as low as possible to allow Bitcoin to be more competitive as a payment network.
@_date: 2016-03-05 09:50:07
Ask yourself what regular users want? A: Trading bitcoin tokens and buy stuff with low or no fee. 
Perfect scaling solution will be to slow predictable block limit rise (as proposed in BIP101) and to implement Lightning Network... so we can scale users and number of transactions.

Now I have some more questions :)
If LN is its own decentralized p2p network, is it private network or public network? Can other users join this network and earn some fee? Is this LN p2p similar to Bitcoin network where POW is used to secure transactions?
If payment goes from one LN to another LN, what is actually transfered between LN nodes? Is it private keys to unlock funds on Bitcoin network?
@_date: 2016-02-22 08:35:36
I just heard about Lightning Network and I have a few questions.
If I deposit bitcoins to LN, do I operate with bitcoins or some other tokens?
If I buy something and funds goes from one LN to another LN, does funds goes directly from one LN to another or through Bitcoin blockchain? And how is double spend handled if funds goes directly to other LN?
How is LN different from ex. BitPay? If I use BitPay and merchant use BitPay, funds goes directly from me(-1) to merchant(+1) (not through Bitcoin blockchain) and there is no need to wait for block confirmation.
Can LN operator steal my funds or prevent payment to some services?
If Mycelium wants to adopt, will it have ther own LN node?
Will futire payments using LN looks like payments today? Merchant gives me QR code and I scan QR and pay using Mycelium?
Is LN node signle node or p2p software? If LN is single node one country can declare LN network as money transmiter and have to follow bank laws (licence, AML, KYC, ...).

Why core cant agree to rise block limit to 2MB, that will satisfy classic and unlimited and give core enough time to develop Lightning Network? Bitcoin network will still have majority of core nodes. Then another block rise to 4MB and in teh meantime wait for Lightning Network adoption. If LN is huge success then majority is using LN and then decide if block size can be reduced back to 2MB or 1MB.
@_date: 2016-02-23 14:33:20
How about Chinese government takes down 5 biggest mining farms/pools in the same day. Hash rate goes down to 1%. Now time between mined blocks goes from 10minutes to 1000minutes(16 hours). The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks. We have to wait 1344 days for Bitcoin to lower difficulty. Is this scenario even possible?
@_date: 2016-02-22 13:30:44
Thanks again :)
In Bitcoin network user can trigger double spend. In LN user can not do that. What about LN node, can LN make double spend? Is it game theory and LN want's to act honest as they collect fees?
How can second LN checks if bitcoins really exists and first LN node not sending some thin air bitcoins? LN checks Bitcoin's blockchain?
I promise i'll read some tech docs on LN.
