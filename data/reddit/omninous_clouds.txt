You can actually set up recurring transactions to send to other addresses too. So you could buy $10 in bitcoin then send $10 in bitcoin to an address.

This right here.
Downloading the blockchain is easy. Verifying it to make sure it all checks out is harder.

Sensationalism on the Internet has become too common. There's not much than can be done about it except for rolling your eyes when you see titles like this.

You're right, they absolutely could. I definitely don't trust people on the internet. Especially when it comes to stealing irreversible money.
I don't want to condone this behavior, but this (could be)/is a well executed scam.
I doubt it's explicitly against Ebay's rules. Seller is just selling cards that can be used for bitcoin. There's no actual bitcoin involved and the product is physical (as opposed to virtual). Plus, if they kept the keys and stole money that was sent to the cards, buyers would have a really hard time proving that it was the seller. 
I mean you could logically conclude that it was the seller, but that's not solid evidence. You could have used a weak password on an exchange, you might have a keylogger, somebody physically saw the key, etc. It would be hard to convince Ebay that it's the seller that stole it. Plus, *even if* Ebay decides to ban the user / freeze the Paypal account, the real value is in having the keys. The selling account and $8 for the cards is trivial. So what if Ebay takes that back. 
Having the private keys of 100 people who don't know enough not to trust people on the Internet... There's some serious potential earnings there. People who buy these things know enough about bitcoin to want to have some but don't know enough to keep it safe. Also most people buying wallets are using them as a single place to store bitcoin. I doubt people have three different wallets. So the seller end up with 100 copies of keys that people are going to use to store bitcoin... Only cost is the money it takes to make the cards.
Selling the cards isn't a scam. They work as advertised. (So Ebay might not insta-ban this.) It's just that the seller has a backdoor in the product and it's hard to prove that the backdoor was used and it's impossible to get the money back.

Same boat. The amount of bitcoin I *used* to own... I try not to think about it.
@_date: 2017-01-20 03:09:45
Gotcha. I misunderstood.

I had a similar idea after [seeing this guy]( use miners to burn off the extra electricity his solar farm generated. The extra electricity had to be consumed whether he mined or not, so mining just generates returns on the extra electricity.
You have to heat your living space / water. It's kind of a sunk cost. So why not create a way to generate returns on the heat you're already going to need?
[made a good point]( that the cost of retrofitting your current heating systems might make this idea infeasable.
And [pointed out]( that natural gas has a higher BTU/$$ ratio than electricity, meaning using electricity for heat is less (cost) efficient.
I would really be interested in hashing (hah) out this idea further. I think it's worth exploring.

You can change the maximum amount of connections you have, which lowers the amount of bandwidth needed. There's also a few other bandwidth limited options available.

A CPU in your computer is designed to do lots of different types of calclations. We have since designed computer that *only* do the calculations reqired for bitcoin mining. These Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) can mine bitcoin several orders of magnitude faster than a general purpose CPU.
Now imagine thousands of people each using hundreds of ASICs to mine bitcoin. The bitcoin software adjusts the difficulty of the calculations to match the power of miners. Since there is a ton of mining power, the calculations are *really hard*.
tl;dr: Yes, computers are inefficient.

Yeah sensational titles like this are terrible. Clickbait.

A commenter in this thread [said that 70-80 connections generated about 20 GB of data per day](
A *rough* extrapolation is 8GB/month per connection.

The block reward began as 50 BTC, and has been cut in half twice now.

NVM. Misunderstanding.
@_date: 2017-01-28 20:28:48
This is interesting.
I'd really like to explore some numbers. I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'd be interested in just seeing the difference.

Financially motivated miners will switch to the most profitable chain.
I'd wager a guess that most miners are financially motivated.
@_date: 2017-01-28 21:24:15
Hmmm. Not looking too great. It would be hard to overcome that much of a cost difference.
Natural gas powered miners?
@_date: 2016-12-19 06:31:53
How so?

To secure bitcoin and make sure other people can't reverse transactions, bitcoin requires that a certain amount of 'work' be done in order to add transactions to the bitcoin blockchain (the record of all transactions)
This 'work' is simply a very hard math problem. Once you solve this math problem, you can add transactions to the blockchain. You also get a reward (currently 12.5 BTC) for doing so. Finally other people can easily verify that your solution is correct.
This makes reversing transactions very difficult, because in order to do that, you would have to do the same amount of work that someone else has already done, plus more work to get included on the blockchain.
If you have the resources to do that much work, you're better off just doing the normal work and collecting the reward.
Bitcoin mining is the process of trying to solve those hard math problems.
This may be too technical.

I can 100% guarantee you that you cannot ‘sue’ google.
Google isn’t dumb. They know this happens. And they also have their own lawyers. I can assure you they have already thought about this.

I was under the impression that having more than 8 connections "helped the network" in some way. Is this wrong?

I think it was the drugs. They eventually found the servers and got full control of them before the site was shutdown.

Remember when a BU miner mined a block above 1MB due to a bug?

It definitely did not have any of that.

Is there any way to make this process faster? I have like 10 accounts with 2FA, I don't have time to go into each one, and remove the old 2FA and register the new one.
Could I screenshot the QR codes and store them in an encrypted form? Then scan the QR codes with my new phone?
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:37:37
While true, this has been known for a long time.

I can't stand MLMs for this reason. The people involved are so fucking dedicated and clueless *at the same time*.

That's what makes it so interesting!
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:29:49
No. All the app does is scan the QR codes and then display the digits.
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:08:36
I agree that "trying to guess a lucky number" is a better explanation.
I think you're looking too far into it. Nobody is trying/appearing to sound authoritative and dissuade questions. The phrase just an oversimplification. It's not technically correct but easier to understand.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:11:41
If I use Google Authenticator, all I would need to do is restore the (i)phone to factory-clean state, correct? 
If I lost the phone, *then* I'd have to invalidate the existing 2FA codes, correct?
@_date: 2017-06-28 13:38:11
I disagree.
This is a line I often use to explain mining to newcommers. I understand it's not 100% correct. But the technical distinction between the words is too detailed for people that don't understand how mining works on a high level.
That statement is technically not correct, but like with many topics, concepts are often simplified so they can be more easily understood.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:08:29
Authy isn't a *type* of 2FA. Services will say "We use 2FA, here's a QR code to scan". Then you can take whatever 2FA program you like to scan the code. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:28:06
There's a standard for 2FA. Authy is software that implements this standard. There are other pieces of software that implement the 2FA standard.
It's like MP3 and iTunes. MP3 is the standard. iTunes is software that works with the standard. There are also other options available, such as VLC, which also implements the standard.
