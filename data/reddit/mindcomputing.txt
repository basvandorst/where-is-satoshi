I am not a fiance nor law attorney but seriously trading how should any government tax that event? There is just no physical event where you have Fiat return from the trade unless you convert it back to Fiat...

I offered my customers to pay me in bitcoin too for 25% less of the advertised prize since I have to pay no Value added tax, trade tax and income tax. I just have to write the sold item of my inventory and when I hold BTC (last in first out) and "convert" it back to fiat I don't pay income tax. yeah germany is weird....

I pay taxes for each closed contract of a purchase when a customer buys something and pays in Fiat in cash sepa or PayPal. When someone decides to pay for the goods in bitcoin is no longer a purchase contract but mere a trade between two parties hence not a taxable event since there is no Cashflow.
