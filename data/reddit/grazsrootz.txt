I know right? I'm watching the movie IT right now but I can't keep my eyes off these dips and swings haha
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:57:09
So far my XEM and XRP have been pretty good in this volatile market. I diversified quite a bit into them over the past few days and I'm happy I did. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:02:29
Not saying it's the bees knees but it has been a good place to hedge for the volatility
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:22:23
Haha yes I love it you're the man, describes tonight for me perfectly
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:59:06
Is the crash/bubble bursting? Sure feels like it 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:46:01
Not really, happens in volatile stocks all the time. But the swings are probably worse in this market because it's unregulated, there's alot of uncertainty and there's obviously insider trading too. It's just the name of the game, big risk = big loss or big win
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:22:37
Yeah idk I'm trying to figure out if I should just dump my bit if bch and cut my losses. Anyone willing to chime in would be appreciated. I'm wondering if it will even come back from this 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:12:59
I don't think anyone here has the data available to calculate that. Different machines are being used to mine, all of which vary in efficiency
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:51:56
BCH taking a huge dump right now. No surprise 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:34:06
Dipping again 
Edit: looks like another hard dip. For those of you looking to buy get ready 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:29:53
Technically yes you are correct. But this would be incredibly hard to track
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:58:21
Most are saying around 8-9k
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:54:39
What application are you using to do this and how do I get started. Any websites or articles I could read? I like this 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:57:52
This might be the actual crash
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:02:36
Might be a good idea to hold off for now let things stabilize
P.s. I'm taking a major hit right now and it sucks 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:43:15
Who knows...most likely anyone who is invested in crypto will take a bath. But whenever it bottoms out whoever still holds will win eventually 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:22:25
Bch is a joke down more than the rest of them. Overhyped
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:48:46
Might go lower than that
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:20:47
Interesting I will have I keep an eye out for that 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:31:33
Never can tell but I guess it's worth looking out for. If you're right then you're on to something 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:45:46
Couple of places poloniex is one
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:03:38
I'd buy the dip after it hit
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:33:37
Is this coinbase pro too?
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:03:28
And the multiple ddos attacks. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:04:06
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:05:58
I wonder if this has anything to do with the current sell off. When the lag is gone, I bet the price will be much lower. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:37:14
the average will slowly come down over time. although you could be right your thought process is flawed. You could have an average near 240 for a while even if the bitcoin currency drops to cents on the coin and stays there indefinitely. the low price would slowly bring the average down over time
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:02:52
I PUT IT ALL IN! NOW I CANT EAT. PLEASE GIVE ME REDDIT GOLD SO I CAN TRADE FOR SOME RAP SACKS

prepare to be downvoted by wishful thinkers

Bout to jump off my roof I LOST 3 BTC TODAY!
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:06:19
CampBX is based in the USA (GA) and seems to be fairly legit, looks like they are trying to legitamize trading
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:30:47
YOIU FUCKING LOST ALL OF MY MONEY, MY HOUSE MY CAR, EVERYTHING WASS IN BITCOIN. GOODBYE CRUEL WORLD

@_date: 2013-04-11 17:04:09
Its shit like this that is making me say fuck bit coin trading, fuck all of this im so happy i didnt deposit any money. Im just going to use it for what it is intended for making online purchases.
You got robbed, they basically took money from you....You added it to an online wallet and they gave you the market price at the time, so basically it takes a few days to get cash into the account and you have to accept whatever market price is 3 days (or however long it takes) later when it is deposited into your wallet. 
I would check the TOS, if they stole your money you may be able to pursue legal action? not so sure about international law though. I have seen alot of people complaining about bit stamp. Also is the wallet displaed in USD before depositing or in BTC?

@_date: 2013-04-10 17:23:04
Its not just mt gox, look at the other exchanges, they are going down as well
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:06:49
19.6875 minute lag
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:36:17
I am interested to know this as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:17:10
Exactly, you can tell there are alot of people wishful thinking on this sub.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:57:03
Could be the bubble bursting but no one knows. According to the people on this sub, they say is is not popping but i think this could just be wishful thinking 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:50:17
Idk ask OP
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:43:05


Should do this anyway, one wipe and you're good every time
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:18:07
Yes, i saw it, people are downvoting you because it happened so fast and most missed it. Its funny that this shows up during what looks like a pretty big sell off, and huge ~20 minute lag. I was actually going to post something to see if anyone else saw it. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:46:23
probably clogged servers from everyone selling and watching the charts.
