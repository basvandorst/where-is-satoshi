Robinhood already have more than 2 million active users. I think they will be able to handle more traffic than your regular exchange. But again, the amount of people flocking from coinbase will be like nothing we have ever seen, and that is saying something in the crypto market...

And the thing is, since it is not your money and you can't afford to lose it, you will make a mistake. Rule 1, never invest what you can't afford. Don't get me wrong man/woman, it is a good buy opportunity but if you are not careful you will lose everything,  specially if this is your first time doing this. But we far as I know you might be a professional trader...

There is a restriction on how much you can convert legally, and if you want to go through the black market they will charge you an arm and a leg for it... Sauce: My uncle makes about 1000 dollars a month as an engineer if he could get dollars at the"legal" rates, but 50 dollars if he was too get dollars through the black market.

You are an idiot and it is because of people like you no one can have good things. Earn the 6k first and then you can invest theyn in the most volatile market we have ever seen.

 I have been in the crypto market for 2 years now, so by no means I'm an expert or a veteran ( although one could argue the past couple of months have been the hardest ever in the young industry). But, I always thought HODL meant not selling for Fiat. Using Bitcoin is not the problem, selling it is. If you decided to buy a TV with Bitcoin and immediately purchase the same amount of Bitcoin you used to purchase the TV then you have actually increased the demand for Bitcoin slightly increasing the price ( as long as the store selling the TV keeps the Bitcoin in that state). At the end of the day, Bitcoin is an ecosystem that offers a service (to transact, and or hold value) as people see the benefit of transacting or holding value with Bitcoin the price will go up because its many benefit ( which are decentralization, fungibility, fixed supply, and censorship resistance)

Well done stocks can give you dividends, they can split, The company can decide to buy back (reducing the supply). But at the end of your stock does not produce dividends then yeah. You hope someone pays more later.

It's not the only reason but it is a reason. The value of the stock is dictated by the present performance and predicted performance. Why would you say is the reason?

Just because I took out my original investment around 15k doesn't mean I want the rest of my investment go to shit. Never keep all your eggs in one basket, regardless of how sturdy you believe that basket is.

Me too, just not through coinbase. Robinhood crypto exchange can't come soon enough.

Actually I haven't lost anything, I bought in early and sold my original investment. But they did scare and confused a lot of people out there. People with a lot of disposable income...

Lol you mean it's not only because bcash. The fight still has a negative effect on the market. And the fight empowered alt market. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:53:26
The main reason is because it is widely used for ICOs

The government is a dictatorship, they fuuucckkked up the economy of one of the richest countries in the world (in terms of natural resources). They are a big scam, and trust me this coin is also a scam. I have no doubt in my mind yet will fuck this too. This is the same government that broke into people's houses to steal mining rigs. Oppressed the media. Welcomed drug Lord's into their military and government. Crippling inflation. Starvation... You name it. There is no fucking way they raised almost a billion dollars on this scam. And if they did I'm just glad everyone that invested in this government will lose everything they invested...
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:15:11
I'm not saying is bcash fault, BTC had to be able to repeal that kind of attacks if we are to actually become mainstream and global. What I am saying is that coinbase choose the worse possible timing to introduce confusion in a very wealthy market.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:20:53
I believe it can and it will but this stupid fight and low blow hit us at a pretty crappy time. And gave wings to the alt market.

Why would she let you use all her life savings? Why would you ask for all her life savings... My best advice is wait it out, or buy the dip to lower your cost per BTC. But again if you used all her life saving and yours on this then there is not much you can do...
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:29:15
And let me add, consensus/majority stayed with BTC, that's why there was a hard fork and not an adoption into the original Bitcoin's code. Consensus means majority. Now Ver And Co. Are using shady tactics to get users and keep hash power in the hopes that they can overthrow real Bitcoin. I hope that people can see past all the shadiness... 
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:23:28
Btw I sincerely appreciate being able to have a rational discussion with you.
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:11:48
You are not alone, I went from Bitcoin in coinbase to alts in other exchanges and now I'm trying to go back to Bitcoin slowly. But yeah I placed most of my bitcoins on the BTC vault and it is such an issue to get it out that it is forcing me to hodl... Which is a good thing. I think I would have panic sold a few times.
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:21:52
This is so funny!
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:18:12
Actually Bitcoin is also represented by physical properties, a specific series of 0 and 1 that are understood by machines. It exists. It's properties are the code that is accepted by the majority. BCH is not Bitcoin because the consensus decided it is not. BTC is Bitcoin. BCH is bitcoin Cash. So the question is, why is Ver si obsessed in calling BCH Bitcoin. The answer usually is because he believes that BCH is closer to the White paper written 10ish years ago. I think the consensus is entitled to decide where we go as we encounter barriers. The white paper is not law, it's guidance. And just because it worked for the first X number of years does not mean it will keep working for X number of years. Remember Moore's law is dead. What I can't understand is why so many people supporting Bitcoin cash want to call it Bitcoin... You guys that invested hard worker money should be the first one rejecting this smoke screen tactics. Because let me tell you, the internet remembers and everything you do can and will be used against the community in the future.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:43:13
Why can't you reveal why lol dumb!!!
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:22:35
The white paper says nothing about block size. And it was Satoshi the one that include the block size limit. But Ver keeps bringing this narrative that the Bitcoin developers introduced the block limit, which is one of his many lies.  The only thing that you might argue is that the white paper defines Bitcoin as a peer to peer cash system. And based on fees, BCH has lower fees than BTC, but at what cost.  Making Chinese mining companies stupid rich by allowing them to print free money. You can't scale block size forever and that's a fact. Unless you want people spamming the block with cat pictures. But then you may say, well let the miners decide what goes on the block. Bye bye decentralization and censorship resistance.  But BCH followers shit on other solutions like lighting. And the best part is that if real Bitcoin decided to go to bigger block size there will be no reason for BCH because they haven't done shit in the past 6 months that other alts don't do faster or better or cheaper. Remember, in the big picture, the difference is 1 line of code (oversimplifying)
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:11:04
Use case is not any different now than it was before.
No one has ever said big blocks are bad, they are just not the solution to scalability because it is linear. And sadly Moore's law is dead... But that's seems to be the only thing that is being changed within BCH code. Now at 32MB blocks!!! I'm not opposed bigger size blocks and I believe it will be revisited later.  
And btw faster segwit adoption would have greatly reduced the high fees seen over the December January periods. Completely disproving Vers narrative about last December... Look at the fees now. About 1.85 USD or 20k SATs with a volume of 8 billion USD now. Compared to 50 USD fees at a 23 billion USD volume highest in December. BCH max volume has been about 8 billion USD and a fee of 0.9 USD. Now find the percentage with respect to coin value:
On December 8th BTC was 16k USD, with 23b USD volume, and 27 USD fee. The fee equals 0.16 percent of the value of 1 BTC. Similarly, on BCH highest volume day December 20th, BCH was 3.7k USD, with a fee of 0.9 USD. The fee n this case equals 0.02 percent of the value of 1 BCH. It's the difference significant in terms of value provided, no. And even if it was, paying 90 cents for a 4 dollar cup of coffee is still unacceptable so why are this jokers talking about empowering the people and low fees. GTFO. if BCH gets to the volume of BTC the users are going to get recked in fees.
All the changes in the BCH code is to help Asics antminer (our good friend Mr. Johan Wu).

You should report it first...

Consensus is not centralization. But you can get to consensus in centralization since by default centralization gives the power of the many to the few. 
You need to agree that the tactics being used are shady lol. Calling BCH ticker Bitcoin. Writing on your website that you are getting Bitcoin but if you send it to a Bitcoin address the coins are lost forever. Fake Satoshi endorsing BCH. Jihan Wu playing both sides of the coin hard, printing so much money, diluting everyone's coins but no one seems to care. Ver using his fault narrative to mislead so many people dude. I'm just wondering that if you see this why are you still convinced it is better?
