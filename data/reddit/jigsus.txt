You made a bank transfer on December 31st? You're a braver man than I.
The number of things that could go wrong with making a bank transfer on the last day of the year on a non banking day is mind boggling 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:10:15
When do banks open again? They were open today weren't they? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:29:43
Where can you find information about these futures? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:52:17
That's useful! But how do you know when those futures end?

I don't think it was malice on part of coinbase but I do think employees insider traded like madmen. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:40:47
Wow 8 years... Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:28:32
Is there a big list somewhere of who accepts bitcoin for what? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:03:59
Block folio never shills? They had ICO adverts 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:37:27
So what news sources do you prefer? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:07
No? Why would they? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:22:34
Why? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:19:22
You fucking called it. It's dropping already. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:22:36
It jumped from $1500 a few days ago to $8500. Add some leverage to that and you have an amazing recipe for making money.
It won't matter you can't work again because you'd be set for life.
Oh look

Institutional investors have barely dipped their toes into bitcoin. The public is barely starting to take notice and most are just watching from the sidelines. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:49:33
12k dollars was particularly important because it's 10k euros 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:25:20
Too bad he doesn't believe in evolution 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:38:52
Couple extra hundred k? Insider trading on this kind of pump could turn 100k into 10 million. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:23:48
Every coin has. I'm asking you why you thought it is fucked. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:38:54
You called it. Small rally just came. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:35:36
So how exactly are they enforcing that? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:01:48
Ahahahaha wow that's just... Wow.
There's so many ways to keep that trading anonymous that it isn't even funny. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:52:40
It's going to be a bumpy ride for all cryptos until Christmas 
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:10:44
I can't respect his opinions on anything since I know he doesn't believe in something so basic as evolution. Sure he comes up with nice explanations but when it comes to beliefs I can't put any faith in the guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:12:09
So let me ask you this: how much do I need to pay in transaction fees to move my bitcoins from a regular wallet to a segwit wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:20:14
Pretty famous game reviewer. He kind of dropped out because he got cancer though. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:20:41
A ton of banks are using bitcoin. What banks are using ripple? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:09:05
The only thing rai doesn't have is a reputable exchange. I can't find a single one that sells it that's not a crackhouse 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:04:33
It would be much easier just to go through other crypto to launder it 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:53:47
They might actually be lost though 
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:08:33
You don't need to. Just claim crypto market speculation as the source of income. No one can disprove it. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:08:56
If 70% of US bitcoins are lost forever then the value of bitcoin will shoot up. Scarcity 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:57:48
You just say that without looking into it. And don't just say CT and LN. Explain your acronyms. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:34:49
Why? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:34:05
Monero is something else though. Look into it. It has very strong technology behind it. Completely different concepts and paths than shitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:27:09
Doesn't that still leave big ticket items like houses on the table for buying in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:17:03
Yep that's exactly the conclusion I am drawing from that chart too. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:31:21
By that logic I'm rich because I own an airbnb rental that gives me passive income. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:59:50
Are you joking or is that what really happened? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:51:54
Why are you so sure? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:07:21
Rich. He's feeling rich 
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:09:49
He's literally a child who had a stroke of luck
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:32:57
Linked lists don't have the hash of the previous element though 
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:48:24
So what exchange is everyone using? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:48:09
Exactly. Neither of us is rich. That definition is crap. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:11:42
How much is that bitcoin cash worth now? I kind of forgot about it 
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:52:55
I smell commies 
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:37:24
Then it's a blockchain ain't it? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:51:12
I can tell you right now that tether is not legit.
