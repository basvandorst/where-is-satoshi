The reason is : most of the exchanges do not offer fiat for alts, so people sell alts for btc then btc for fiat

I am not sure if my logic is correct but let say i own 5000 btc, i decide to put a short contract and decide to sell all of them at the same time when the contract is going to close, this could be a double win for me no? I took all my fiat and the price would fall, letting me successfully short my contract, no?

Because btc is the standard mesure.. if suddenly eth was the main exchange currency and btc a "coin among other" the impact on other alts would not be the same
