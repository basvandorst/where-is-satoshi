I watched until her titty popped out.  What an embarrassment. She should be working as a liquor or beer brand rep lmao...

Also, it was suspended for weeks. Not just a few hours.

Good if the bubble popped... There is no longer a bubble to talk about.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:39
Umm... If you didn't see this happening when BCH was added to Coinbase, you're blind. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:08:15
Probably still watching. It's very unstable right now. It's been a negative trend all day and usually Asia wakes up and counters it but they didn't do much today. I could see a dip in the next 12-24 hours.

Max out credit cards.

You can do it through coinbase. Not sure on prices or anything though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:20:45
While unlikely... It is a possibility. That's all I'm saying. No one knows lol...
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:24:26
It's a little sketchy to me... They don't make an effort to perfect their English on the site.  The giveaways scare me as the other guy said above.  I saw an email from their support a few weeks ago that looked like one of their support employees was trying to scam customers.  I do not believe the company has intentions of scamming people but the fact they let that happen makes me question the security and quality control.  I wanted to buy IOTA on there and I couldn't withdraw them for weeks and started to get scared to I got out of IOTA... Then yesterday they unblocked the withdraw.

Well it would't dip on Christmas to buy stuff for Christmas. It would happen before then.  I would have assumed just before Black Friday. I assume Christmas will be similar to Thanksgiving.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:46:23
Well the best advice I can give you is to send me all your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:00:28
The dip came today just after Bitcoin hit $10,000 EUR today.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:42:11
How they process fees probably
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:10:36
Will be interesting to see how this plays out.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:38:56
Tell them "I lied to my parents because they think I'm a failure. I actually stupidly sold all of my Bitcoin back when they were worth $300. I only tell them I made all that money to gain a sense of satisfaction from them. I'm really not worth anything." 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:57
It was going to happen eventually.  They pretty much said it was going to happen. So mad I was going to buy some BCH this morning but got distracted.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:32:43
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:38:45
I had 115 IOTA.  Binance had IOTA withdraws suspended for "network congestion".  Bitfinex was allowing IOTA withdraws at the time. Was isolated to Binance.  For the record.  I did not receive one of the emails that the people claim in the link I posted above. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:50:09
Looks like it.

NEWCOMERS. Don't listen to any posts predicting price movements.  Bitcoin is literally unpredictable and could do 1 of 3 things. Stay stable at 17k. Go up or go down. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:03
Buy BCH sell on hype at 3700 or whatever it's at and buy more bitcoin... it's logic.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:06:04
I'm sorry I didn't notice that you were the original poster. No disrespect meant. But I do not believe 3 seconds is anywhere near long enough to even begin to explain Bitcoin. I think it takes a
 commercial 3 seconds to even acquire attention. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:01
The stock exchange can halt when there is a crash. I don't think it's a terrible idea.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:41:21
Lots of possible reasons.  Could be as simple as people being skeptical over the holiday as I have seen many people state that Bitcoin Tends to dip on Black Friday.  Either way I see it rather comforting that we sat steady for a few days after a new high rather than a huge dip. Shows confidence and strength.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:25:13
Don't leave your money in an exchange. Save it to a hardware wallet or a paper wallet...
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:06:40
Everyone already has heard of bitcoin... the problem is they don't know how it works or what it's about. 3 seconds is nowhere near long enough to acquire any supporters lol. Hopefully The Big Bang Theory was researched well enough to give Bitcoin positive publicity.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:57:30
Were you using coinbase? Do you have any other devices that are logged on and don't require you to enter an authenticator passcode (A saved device)? If you can get on to Coinbase, you can at least transfer your Bitcoins out to a wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:23:03
I agree.  There has never been a black Friday where Bitcoin was in a position comparable to what it is today... But there are so many people that trade based on trends and patterns that I wouldn't be surprised if people were selling or holding out on buying because of the "holiday". Anyways... Overcoming a negative trend or pattern is a feat regardless and if we don't have a large dip, nobody will say next year that Bitcoin dips on Black Friday lol.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:41:17
I saw the AD it looks positive. Something along the lines of they invested in Bitcoin years ago and they made a lot of money. Hopefully it doesn't take a turn for the worst lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:34:32
They are scared. Between the stock market predicted to "correct" itself in 2018 and people taking their money out of the stock market to invest in Bitcoin... It's not looking like great returns next year for wall street.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:20:41
As long as you don't lose your 24 word seed, all you have to do is buy a new device and you can recover your bitcoin. And no they aren't stored on the device.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:22:03
Send them to me! JK. I'm not sure why you can't sell them? Send them to another exchange that allows you to sell in Canada. Are you sure they just aren't pending? When you buy them using a bank account it takes like 10 days to settle.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:17:39
A major one against is the amount of energy that is required.  It's also hard to see how people adjust to using bitcoin because of the volatility.  If it wants to be used as a legitimate currency, it will need to be less volatile.  The last point that scared me the most is that it's not backed by any governments and you can really lose everything if something does happen to Bitcoin.  At least if I have my money in a bank, it is insured by the government.
On the contrast... a completely electronic currency system just makes sense for the future... 
It can be anonymous (this could be more bad than good if you consider how governments will use this to fight the adoption of bitcoin).  
It's way quicker to send large amounts of money than a wire transfer or to use a check. 
That's my take on Bitcoin.  I'm both scared and excited to see where Bitcoin goes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:41
Or they couldn't handle the traffic... That was nuts..
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:11:07
Well I've been reading many people who say that Bitcoin always dips on black friday. I would assume, if we make it through the weekend holding steady at around 8k... We will be looking at a new high rather soon.

Congrats on being debt free! Now run! Run far and don't look back so you don't have to see whether it was good timing or not.

I just checked Chinese Year year was January 28th this year and there was no dip.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:25:54
It's weird to think about lol. I imagine I would have gotten weak and sold out when it sat around $250 for so long in 2014 or 2013 when it almost hit $1000. It would have been hard not to sell then.  I was also in college in 2013 so I probably would have blown all the money on alcohol.

Would be worth $10 when Bitcoin is worth $100,000 or $100 at $1,000,000 lol I'd say don't waste the time.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:42:36
Chinese New Year isn't until middle of Feb. And people said the same about black friday. There has never been a Chinese New Year where Bitcoin was in a comparable position. Only time will tell.

Obviously you didn't see the original post before it was deleted lol. He wanted a 3 second ad.  How are you going to get any message across in 3 seconds?
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:31:33
No. They randomly locked out my account while trying to trade. I'm an active trader fully verified and all... Customer support is useless.  Go look at their reddit also. Many complaints of Coinbase double, tripple and even someone that claims they charged them 5 times for their purchase. Be careful.
