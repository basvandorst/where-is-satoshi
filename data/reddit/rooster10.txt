I do have a Bank of America nearby, and I was looking into buying through GetBitcoin via a cash deposit there, but every time I try to submit an order on the site I get an error message.

Thanks! And a merry Christmas to you!

I've been wondering the same thing, and recently made my first bitcoin purchase through a person with high ratings on  I went to my local branch of his bank, gave them his account number and deposited cash, he had the bitcoins in my wallet in minutes. Very nice transaction, and he only charged 3% on top of what I was buying for his cut. I'm sure you can find better deals on there, too.

What's the cheapest option if there are no Wells Fargo or Chase banks near me?

These posts make me very angry that there are no Chase banks in my state. The nearest Wells Fargo is two and a half hours away as well.

I was looking at Bitfloor, but I don't have any Wells Fargo or Chase banks near me, and the wire transfer fee is $10, so that's a turnoff for me.

This is neat! I've never been tipped on Reddit.

Thanks for the advice, man. My mom has this, too, but she doesn't take it as seriously as my dad, and I don't think it affects her *as* much. 
But it seriously affects my dad, and like I said, those symptoms you listed ring very true with me. 
I'll definitely be setting up an appointment for this soon.
I sincerely appreciate your offer to pay for the appointment, but I'm hoping it will be covered under my insurance. Regardless, I will, of course, use my powers for good.

Your first paragraph there hits scarily close to home for me. 
My dad also has severe sleep apnea. 
I probably need to look into this.

How does that solve anything?

My house got broken into a few months ago, when bitcoins were about $10. I *thought* I had my wallet data backed up correctly. My laptop got stolen, along with my wallet with 15 bitcoins in it. Turns out I didn't back up the right thing.
I'm very sad now.
