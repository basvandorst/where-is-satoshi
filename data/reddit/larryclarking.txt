The 300 ways to pay I believe is the different payment methods. You can buy/sell bitcoin with Paypal, Western Union, bank transfers, and hundreds of types of giftcards. I have sold some bitcoin for Amazon cards for a 40% markup. Pretty good way to shop if you have bitcoin. Not sure about the widget. I have not tested it yet.

Bitcoin is in the perfect position. Innovation is happening and bitcoin is still king. In 5 years bitcoin has maybe 30% of market share, but the total industry is booming and bitcoin is $5000+

I would say bitcoin is proven as a safe hedge against struggling debt-based currencies. Bitcoin is the top performer 6 of last 7 years. So by this standard its a good defense against all fiat currencies.

Bitcoin at all time highs, and I don't think we have really made the breakthrough we are searching for. The future is bright!

Interesting, but I am told Bobby does not really know the Chinese market. He is considered somewhat of an outsider and not in the in crowd there.

Matryx - A Decentralized Collaboration Platform
Matryx consists of a bounty system, a library of digital assets, and a marketplace. Problems are posted, along with a bounty for a verified solution. Users then collaborate to solve problems, share results, and earn rewards.
Rewards are given to all relevant contributors, and all submissions are added to the Matryx library and marketplace for future purchase. This will create an ecosystem of public collaboration and ideas that will drive research and innovation.
The ultimate goal of Matryx is to incentivize collaboration in fields of knowledge and creation like STEM. To reach that goal, we need resources that support R&amp;D demands and help create a community of participants and contributors. Token Sales have quickly become a proven means to achieve such growth for blockchain-based technologies like Matryx.
