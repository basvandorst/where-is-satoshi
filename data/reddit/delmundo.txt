It's a Rails app and does an AJAX refresh after page load.  Besides rendering the app, the server has a job queue to fetch the latest BTC/USD quotes from  Coinbase/BTC-e/BTC China/Vault of Satoshi.
I noticed that viewing source in Chrome shows the JSON.  Perhaps that is a Chrome bug.  However, if you refresh the view source you'll get to see the HTML that was rendered.

When normal people see $0.000000139, they think WTF, and have no frame of reference or perspective.  However, we all have perspective on $1,￥1, €1, or 1 ruble.  Therefore, if the app lists 138,312 satoshi having a value of $1, then most people will have an understanding of the value of satoshi.
I added exchange and currency selectors so everyone can see the number of satoshi in USD, CNY, EUR, and RUR, from the tickers at Coinbase, BTC-e, Vault of Satoshi, and BTC China.
I think it was very rude of ero79 to spam my app announcement.  And ero79 is incorrect - our apps are not the same.
