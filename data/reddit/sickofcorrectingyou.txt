Jesus H. Christ! 
One of the most brilliant minds of our generation creates a tool that can be used to stay out of the range of predatory banks and governments. 
The first goddam thing that the most average and mediocre of minds wants to do is drop their drawers and let these predators fuck them up the ass.
I hope you report all of your bitcoin holdings like the good little fucktoy of the banks and governments that you appear to be.

Bitcoin has an intrinsic value that sets it above gold and fiat: instant P2P payment. Even if a bitcoin was only worth 1 US penny, the intrinsic, essential value of Bitcoin is the ability to send to anyone, anywhere in the world, instantly.

But people are using bitcoins. Until your "if" becomes reality, bitcoins have intrinsic value.

Bitcoin is a currency and an accounting system. Many other things, too.


2. a distributed and verifiable public ledger       
3. a peer-to-peer payment processing network       
4. a triple-entry accounting system     
5. a store of wealth       
6. a cryptosignature creation and verification device      
7. a personal offshore bank account       
8. a distributed timestamp server     
9. the network, monetized    
Bitcoin is nothing but intrinsic value. It was designed as such to make it valuable.

"[Bitcoin is] very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though." 
Libertarians aren't known for their love of taxes. It's the only political philosophy mentioned by Bitcoin's creator.
