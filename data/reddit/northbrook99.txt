I will up vote any Milton Friedman video under any circumstance, for any reason, at anytime.  I have seen this video and I hope bitcoin is able to reduce the size of governments. Like Milton says, the US government already takes nearly half of the US GDP! The government will spend everything they take in from taxes and everything they can barrow. But it's we the people people that must learn and teach our children and tell our representatives  that a small government it much better for all citizens than a large one. The government does what we the people tell it to do.

Lots of truth there. Few fully understand the power of Bitcoin and implications of that power. The scary part is that the early adopters (anyone right now) might have huge responsibilities in the future. As it is written, "From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked." Luke 12:48

Hold on.... I have seen this tactic before used against companies like Tesla Inc. They (the media) will publish old negative articles right before a positive event. IMO they do this to see if they can lower the stock price by scaring people out of the stock. That way when good news comes out from the event they have bought in right before at a depressed price and they can make a quick profit. They use EMH or efficient market hypothesis to their advantage. 
In this case they might be testing to see if they can have any effect on the price. Of course it could be completely innocent but I would be highly suspect of that thought.

If the money supply increases without an equal increase in output then you have inflation. I suppose if some item is in high demand the price might go up but general inflation is all about the money supply. Milton even illustrated the point with the confederate printing press example.

Waste of time for them. They better learn to get competitive. Monopoly = poor products at a high cost. (Thank you Milton for that) Bitcoin will be their competition which is good because that means better money for all people.  
@_date: 2017-01-22 05:06:11
I have watched this video twice now. Another salient point Milton makes is that inflation is taxation without representation. Wasn't that the cause of war for America's independence?

The problem with understanding Bitcoin and its energy usage is that the value of Bitcoin is so high that it's difficult to conceptualize. The world stands at a cross road right now. If Tump fails; a totalitarian government is not many years away. How many warning have been given by people like Orwell and Friedman. I'm worried that the current times are good enough that people don't really want to fight for freedom and would rather have the government direct their spending. If you believe in Bitcoin then you believe in freedom and that battle for freedom is not far. Freedom to save money in the way we think is best. Freedom to save for retirement however we think is best. Choose fiat if you would like. History shows how well that works. Bitcoin could be worth any dollar number you want to assign. Bitcoin = freedom how can you value that? How much energy is freedom worth? If required, we shall harness the entire power of the sun to maintain freedom. ( rant over and now I feel better)

As I understand it... Look at M2 (money supply) (google FRED M2) We have had a huge increase in M2. Inflation will come but it takes some time.

Milton Friedman stated it is that sample in another video. I guess how we experience inflation is driven by demand?    
@_date: 2017-01-21 22:21:20
The connection here is that bitcoin has a fixed supply so you don't have to worry about the printing press. Also, the clip explains the weakness of gold as money.

Obama was very predictable and markets like that. Now we have the opposite. Today was quite a shock to the stock market. At noon the market just froze... or was extremely muted. Monday it will be interesting. It takes time for people to internalize changes to reality.

I feel the same! It was a unique time in history. Computer technology was coming of age. Radio shack was still popular. Computer games were awesome and getting better each year. The world seemed safe (sure we had a Cold War and the Berlin Wall but no terrorists running wild) the World Trade Center was still standing proudly in the New York skyline.

The mass media is almost always misleading. Especially if it's something new and they are not paid to give it good reviews. The are even more hyper critical if the new thing competes with old established business. When Tesla Motors was at $30/ share they blasted the stock with every false and misleading article they could write. Telling people "don't through your money away" and "Electric cars will never succeed!" 
Thank you you mass media for protecting us fools.  
Tesla is now at ~$200/share and it could be $300 sometime next year. Thanks to you many people lost out on an order of magnitude change in price because you scared them.

I listened to the whole thing. I don't think gold will save anyone in a crisis since it can't be easily moved or sold. I'm much more optimistic about bitcoin than gold. Also, gold bugs will always mention as a last ditch effort to save their argument that gold will always have some value by saying that you can use it for something. What are you going to do will 5kg of gold? You can't eat it or warm your house with it so who cares? You'll starve looking at your pile of gold. Now next they will say (and it's true) that you can't do anything with bitcoin (physically) But that's only a half truth because people really desire sound money and sound money will always have value and it will have value beyond that of gold's value because you can send it anywhere in the world which actually gives it the most value of any currency in existence.

I'm glad they did it. Better now than after a bitcoin ETF is approved. Then even more investors would be burned and it would receive significantly more negative press.

It's a neutral comment. I can't make a recommendation since I don't fully understand the implications technically. I'm looking at Bitcoin from a finance perspective. If I can transfer a million dollars to anywhere in the world any time for $30USD. Bitcoin still has immense value.  
@_date: 2016-12-23 00:54:24
I don't think we have entered the greed stage. In fact, it seems that bitcoin is still under valued.  At $14 billion market cap bitcoin is small for a currency. I just read that (2010 numbers) about $400 trillion of loans and bonds tied to the LIBOR are outstanding.

If Bitcoin can be used to store wealth then it does not need to scale right now (maybe not for another year) Even if transactions were to cost $30 USD that's still less than an international wire transfer.  Right now in history a store of value is more important than a medium of exchange. (Bond markets are faltering) Bitcoin is a great store of value because people want it function for that purpose and it can't be manipulated by governments and central banks. The ability to have low cost micro-transactions through scaling would be added bonus and would certainly boost the price of Bitcoin but it's just a bonus.

I agree 100%. Wealth can be destroyed. If factories are bombed then wealth is destroyed and mankind is poorer as a whole.  Even if you can rebuild the factory it's a huge loss since we could have built a new factory instead of replacing the damaged one.

Adam Smith said all you need to know in his book The Wealth of Nations. Kings and rulers were well known at his time to devalue money. Smith even gives the amount the money had been devalued at the time of his writing. Some of the money was devalued so much it represented one 1/60th of its original base metal quantity. So why should we be surprised when we see countries wanting to leave the euro? They want the ability to devalue their money like all sovereigns have been for the last 1000 years. It's an easier way to pay off your creditors.

I guess the question is: what price can bitcoin realistically achieve within the next three years? The world  has trillions in fiat and trillions in gold. Why shouldn't Bitcoin have a trillion market cap? Maybe more? At least with bitcoin you know what you own. With fiat it changes with the winds. Two rate increases from the FED in the last ten years now three or four next year? Why the increase when many Americans ( appx. 40% ) don't have $1000 in savings. How can the FED be worried about inflation? Also, how can their be "money chasing goods" when people don't have enough savings to live without a pay check for six months?

True. But it's still $400 trillion in fiat that should find a home in bitcoin before the only way you will be able to buy a bitcoin is with a real asset (a house, a farm, tons of rice, maybe a futures contract for rice? ( that got me thinking))
