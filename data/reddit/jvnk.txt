Right, just to those unlucky enough to be around them. And when they control a highly sought after resource, that evil is nice and isolated. Okay. Forget about commonly accepted forms of recourse, we don't need that.
I guess it's a matter of perspective. For me, I have more than enough to live comfortably even with taxes. If you're not doing well because of taxes then you're probably not doing well period. I don't mind being taxed, though I do mind where it goes. Thankfully the trend has been decreased military spending and increased social welfare spending. In the end though I don't see it as *evil*. I have made full use of roads/transit, utilities, healthcare, education, all of which were entirely or partially subsidized by various levels of government. Oh, they even sent me a check reimbursing me for tuition I paid for that I never actually needed to pay. Yes, from the state, not the school. What greedy shmucks.


Except it's not... at all. Modern society is *unbelievably* complex. Governance exists so that - at least in theory - everyone is on the same playing field. *Yes*, that may not be the case now in the US or some other countries, sure - but do you understand that this *does not* mean the *concept* is inherently flawed and should be discarded entirely?
If you think humanity is not living up to its potential because governance exists then you're fooling yourself. There are so many other factors outside of government malfeasance and corruption, most of which would still exist in a stateless society.

Well, per the second point, any vendor accepting BTC would be out of their mind not to convert it to USD(or whatever) immediately. Even if they didn't, it'd still be stupid not to have a third party if you're a large company with a lot of revenue.

In this hypothetical scenario there is no central body of law that everybody agrees on. It would be *de facto* acceptable(but not morally or ethically) since nobody is going to stop them or come to your rescue. More likely they'd just kick you out of their territory.
That's not reductio ad absurdum at all, that's a logical conclusion to make given the hypothetical nature of what we're talking about. Maybe natural peaceful order would emerge instead, though I think we'd have to have previously existing nations which established the conditions for and fostered the creation of things like the Internet to spread true understanding and empathy to everyone in the first place. I don't think the peaceful anarchist utopia would emerge naturally, myself.

Communism is a complete failure. I never advocated that. I assumed we were talking about democracy, the model that nearly all developed nations follow to a large extent today.
If by preventing the manipulation and abuse of one's ability to where competition is no longer possible is considered crippling, then I guess our definitions of crippling differ. Here I was seeing the unprecedented level of prosperity in the world today, I guess it's just child's play to what could be if anyone could just do whatever the hell they wanted. There wouldn't be any evil anymore, well no, there would only be evil in some places. But as long as it's not forced on anyone, except for the people it would still be forced on.

let's see what 1BTC is worth in USD in 4 years and then compare it to 1USD?
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:55:02
Considering the fact that we're using the btc -&gt; usd exchange rate as a metric should say something about its utility as a currency. The market is volatile, and even though the exchange rate isn't shooting through the roof right now doesn't mean it doesn't have it's ups and owns, many of which are pretty significant.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:56:15
Oh, okay. You're one of those folks. Complains about states being incontrovertibly evil on a system that was itself fostered by a state, etc etc. Setting aside the hypocrisy, I can't stand that sort of absolutism. You're either a "statist" or you're "awake"(or whatever the fuck); there is no in-between. You know, most people are rational, can see and acknowledge corruption, overreach, etc, but that doesn't mean the logical conclusion is that the state is 100% thoroughly evil and has never done anyone any good. That's why most people have not hopped on the magically-peaceful-and-cooperative-anarchy bandwagon, not because they're "sheep". Hanlon's razor.

Or maybe because, as a functioning of governance, the will of the people is directed at doing good. Nah, it's cause the evil cabal of power-seekers is duping us all with fake charity.
You're sitting here telling me that only bad people flood to positions of power, and simultaneously saying that in a stateless society everyone would be peaceful and cooperative *just because* everyone is by nature peaceful and cooperative. Um, you do realize that in such a society there would be a myriad more positions of power for people to abuse, and *all* of them would be essentially above reproach save for violence?
Yeesh, in a stateless society we wouldn't be sitting here having this discussion; for that matter the Internet wouldn't even exist - we'd be peasants in a fiefdom or (maybe more ideally) hermits in the mountains somewhere.
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:54:02
Meaning they're still out more than they thought they were paying if the exchange rate is up double or triple as TheGift1973 was saying.
Now, they'd have more cash on hand as well. But that's kind of silly to be hoping for that. That's not how you run a business. Therein lies the problem with volatility in general, even when it seems small. Volatility needs to consistently be, at most, pennies on the dollar, otherwise any realistic forecasting goes out the window.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:39:46
Well, at least we agree that I've shat all over your argument.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:39:12
The problem with this is it assumes these:
* Everyone makes rational decisions
* Everyone has equal access to resources
* Everyone is generally nice, cooperative, compromising
In order for everything to be peaceful and for the infrastructure and services necessary for modern life to emerge out of this. I think on small scales(real small, village level, not more than 20-30 people) this is possible. It gets more and more unlikely the bigger we're talking, and considering that the macro level is very much necessary for modern society I'm not sure how you can escape this. Arbitration doesn't just happen on its own, those with better access to resources will do better, regardless of if they "earned" that.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:41:23
What happens when that road owner makes the biggest and best roads? When they own the shortest path between two economic centers by a long shot? When they own the majority of the roads, or, at the least, the ones you need?
Clearly the fact that I said *could* has been lost on you and you've substituted "I think that they would and it's the only possibility" as my position. It's an extreme example, sure - but it would be *de facto* possible, regardless of the *potential* repercussions. 
Anyways, you haven't provided a convincing counterargument showing that effective monopolies wouldn't arise out of those who just happen to live near and control lucrative resources. The repercussions you mention are an ideal scenario. If it benefits them more to be abusive with that control of a resource, then they certainly could(and most likely will). Sure, take your money elsewhere... except when there's nowhere else to go and your survival depends on it. Okay, so everyone should be self-sufficient. In that case we most likely have to reach far back to a much simpler way of life in order to make a stateless society with emergent peaceful cooperation work. Or maybe you could get an army together and take it? 
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:50:43


It really doesn't matter, what matters here is the principle. No B2B is conducted with gold/bitcoin/goats. Similarly the exchange rate is so volatile that you'd be stupid not to lock in the profit. Speculating with your businesses' revenue is a great way to go out of business.
I agree with you on principle, but lets be honest here. A lot of people(I'd say a majority of those in the last year) got into Bitcoin because they were hoping it was their chance to get rich quick(and many did),  not that they were terribly concerned about monetary regulations. Were we expecting the IRS not to clamp down on this vs. leave the money on the table? Anyways, if taxes are really effecting your quality of life, then you aren't doing too well in general.

I've said all along that the decentralizing effect of Bitcoin is partially just a re-shuffling of centralization.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:45:07
Well, realistically the merchant would convert that gold/silver to USD(or whatever)immediately, just as they do bitcoin right now. Unless they actually trade gold or use the substance, anyway. Barely any b2b is conducted with gold, bitcoin, whatever, and the exchange rate is certainly volatile enough that you'd be stupid to hold on to it.
Well, I'm sorry but a decentralized currency is only going to be usable in its raw form to a tiny portion of the population. For bitcoin to gain any real traction, some centralization is going to occur, and it will be very similar to what is in place today. There's a reason financial institutions exist.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:38:26
Ok, well enjoy looking over your shoulder constantly. It'll catch up with you eventually. Be careful not to cut yourself on that edge, too.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:32:56
Bitcoin may not inherently support any of these, but those needs will still exist when you realize you're living in a society where people are born into a certain set of expectations for survival. Either a state "forcefully" extracts this value from its citizens to implement the necessities for that society, or (in a hypothetical stateless society) you're depending on the welfare of the people around you - *especially* strangers and the society at large, given the complexity of modern infrastructure and services. Unless of course you're advocating we go back to very basic ways of living, anyways.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:00:00


All I said is that this is within the realm of possibility, there is no commonly accepted form of recourse besides resorting to violence yourself. I dunno about you, but I don't want to live in a society where disputes between strangers are settled with guns. In fact I'd even go so far as to say that wouldn't be much of a society.


Yeah, governments can only do bad. They never do good. They can never even be well-intentioned. Only individual people and organizations can do good. Oh wait, that's what a government *is*. I would agree with you if the world's governments consisted mostly of ruthless autocrats, but they don't. There's a handful left and their grip is ever-loosening.
In contrast, [half a billion people lifted themselves out of poverty between 1990 and 2010]( I really can't buy into the idea that that would happen in a world with unbridled capitalism, or that indeed capitalism as we know it today would even exist.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:17:27
Err, the main reason gold and silver aren't used in the marketplace is that it's nowhere near as easy as cash, not that there is more complicated tax paperwork. That, and, just like bitcoin, a merchant accepting gold/silver would immediately convert it to USD unless use gold itself for some purpose.
Besides, it's not really that complicated. Sites like Coinbase will generate everything you need(for the most part) and you just plug the numbers into the capital gains form(s).
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:42:05
Ideally, yes. But realistically we'd be living in a micro-fiefdom society similar to what exists in Snow Crash. 
There wouldn't be any roads connecting anything, or there'd be random tolls at every border crossing, or there'd be one large(or several large) companies that you pay annually to use the roads they've built everywhere. Actually probably a mixture of that. Also, whoever's road it is can kill you on site for refusing to pay, with no possible recourse if they so chose(since there is no central body of law in this hypothetical society). Though you might be able to hire mercenaries to fight them.

It just seems like the crux of your argument is that bitcoin is impervious to fraud, we should be trumpeting this misinformation as the title suggests, and you in turn are deflecting any counterargument as a question of semantics around the term "counterfeiting".

LOL, but the "regulation" is so vague and the regulators so far behind as to be effectively nonexistent.

It has nothing to do with regulation but rather the fact that few people invest the time to actually make rational decisions, especially with something as complex as this.
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:46:49
Barely, though. The amount of bitcoin actually spent on goods/services is minuscule compared to the ongoing speculation. Similarly, you'd be out of your mind to make a serious(expensive) purchase in bitcoin right now, and as a vendor you'd be stupid not to convert any btc revenue into USD(or whatever currency) immediately after receiving it.

@_date: 2013-04-11 14:35:27
Well that's stupidly naive, all they have to do is ban the exchanges. Seeing how everyone is still using bitcoin as a proxy for the dollar and other fiat currencies, when it comes to doing actual business with bitcoins banning the exchange for those currencies would completely stifle the economy.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:31:02
If you intend to spend those spare dollars on bitcoins only to convert them back into USD at a later date, that's not stupid. It's just not using them as a currency(which is what we all want, right? Divergence from fiat currency into an actual meaningful btc economy?).
But spending your *existing* bitcoins on something at this point is silly, when all indicators show the exchange rate just keeps rising.

@_date: 2013-11-11 19:55:22


Um, yes it does: 
Deflation helps a small subset of people(savers) and hurts everyone else that a healthy economy needs:


For that matter, this is *insane* volatility and only the biggest fish have "control"(emphasis on the quotation marks).


To my knowledge, almost all business owners accepting BTC are converting to USD to cover operating expenses. The benefits of bitcoin are being ignored because of the exchange rate deflation.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:53:30
While true, not spending your usd doesn't mean it effectively doubles over and over again as time goes on because it's not deflating like bitcoin is.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:49:46
A more appropriate example would be why would I buy *anything* now when I can buy more of it(or literally anything else, including things I can't afford now) in the future if I simply hold onto that same amount of currency? There are certain things I *need* now. However, deflation(and really, volatility) is not helping bitcoin in any way other than helping people make money off of it. It's also important to consider that this is happening much faster than your example - last week I might have afforded one computer, this week perhaps two.
(Also, Moore's law is no longer the case)

@_date: 2013-04-16 21:17:37
How does the hedging escrow scheme work then? Even if they don't use early finalization(which still isn't instant), is SR covering the difference if there is volatility and the merchant doesn't withdraw their bitcoins immediately?
Edit: Apparently this is how it works according to their announcement of the feature: 


They claim a seller will lose on average ~4% using the hedged escrow system. I still fail to see how they wouldn't lose much more given the extreme fluctuations in price we've seen lately.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:59:33
That's precisely what I'm getting at. This is what nearly everyone in the market is doing - speculating and fueling the bubble. The incentive to engage in actual trade with bitcoin is pretty low right now, for a number of factors: ongoing bubble(more profitable to hoard), learning curve(shuts out the vast majority of people), limited options for trade as it is(ever seen the vendor's list? I would trust *maybe* a handful of them).

This exposes further hypocrisy, however. Bitcoin fans *want bitcoin itself to be the currency*, and rightly so. But right now the clamoring for exchanges to step up their game confirms in every possible way that we're all still using it as a proxy for fiat currency, and actual b2b bitcoin trade is minimal if nonexistent(which is what we need to start seeing for it to take off as a currency rather than a store of value).

I'm not sure if that UBS lawsuit is the right example to give, the article says "New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo sued banking giant UBS on Thursday, accusing the company of fraudulently promoting tens of billions of dollars of auction-rate securities as safe when it knew a crisis was brewing." Is that the same as freezing an exchange as MtGox has done here?
With that said, I totally agree there probably is a case somewhere. I'm not sure if MtGox positioned themselves in writing as 24/7 with zero possibility of interruption...the fine print needs to be examined thoroughly methinks.

Suppose bitcoin is trading for $100 usd right now(it's not but bear with me). If you spent that right now on SR and it shot up to $150 overnight, you just lost out on $50, or at least $50 more worth of product from SR. That's why price volatility hurts bitcoin trade. The seller is cool with it(made an extra $50) but you'd probably wish you held on to it. In the opposite case, if the price went down to $50, the seller would have been screwed over(unless they are converting to USD as soon as they receive your bitcoins, before the price drop).

Are these actual losses or on paper losses(i.e. did you sell because you thought it was going to continue crashing)? If you haven't sold yet and thus realized the loss, don't sell until things come back online. If they continue dropping then get out. Things may go up again because speculators may still be interested. If they do go up, see where it goes, and try and sell as soon as it goes close to/meets your buy-in price.
If you want to invest again in the future, don't do it with everything you have, which is what it sounds like you did.

What does that have to do with deflation? Why would I spend btc right now when holding on to it could mean it measurably increases in value? That's what deflation is. That's why deflation discourages spending, particularly in non-essentials and B2B commerce. In the case of bitcoin doubly so with how exchange rates are shooting up. It's not like people are buying essentials or conducting a lot of B2B commerce with bitcoin as it is, so I don't see the continued extreme deflation as a good thing for the currency. People will sure make money off it though.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:21:26
Okay, so you bought an additional 1.65 coins in order to buy the nexus... I was confused, I thought you bought the nexus with the original coins and then immediately rebought the same amount of coins at current prices, which would put you out on two counts. That makes more sense.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:48:43

@_date: 2013-04-11 19:18:39
Yes, but those businesses are turning around and exchanging the bitcoin for USD. It's being used as a proxy for fiat currency, not a medium of exchange itself. Until there are complex b2b services and complex physical products provided by corporations who accept bitcoin, the "trade" we're seeing which bitcoin is utterly negligible.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:19:14
The use of bitcoin as a currency for legitimate physical goods and services is pretty low from what I can tell(if people have hard numbers to prove this wrong, I'm all ears). Most of the trading volume is from the ongoing speculation.
Take a good look at the "physical goods" section of [the Trade article on the bitcoin wiki](
Honestly, who would buy much of anything from any of these vendors? There are a few exceptions, namely bitcoinin and bitcoinstore(both of which specialize in electronics and other geeky products). No general groceries, no general home products. Just niche stuff from no-name vendors I personally wouldn't trust.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:17:19
Agreed, at the moment it seems to be exclusively used by somewhat technical folks. Unfortunately the majority of the wealth in the world is held by non-technical folks, a gap that will need to be bridged for it to rival any fiat currency.

Just saying, it's basic economics that deflation leads to decreased spending, particularly in non-essentials or b2b(particularly important to btc as hardly anyone is buying essentials or conducting b2b with it).

Average consumers aren't the only ones who spend. They're among the minority when it comes to spending. The kind of spending that a fledgling currency with aspirations for dethroning fiat is currently sorely lacking. The deflationary spike we're seeing only further discourages that sort of spending.

Despite how different bitcoin is, it still obeys the basic fundamentals of currency. The fact of the matter is that as the value increases, the incentive to spend proportionately decreases. You actually lost money by spending your 1.65BTC on a nexus 7, when if you had held on to it for a week or so it(or indefinitely) it might have been worth quite a bit more. You additionally lost money by re-purchasing the 1.65BTC because it no doubt cost you much more today than it did sometime in the past to get that 1.65BTC.
Right now, btc is unfortunately little more than a proxy for fiat currency. Few people are getting paid exclusively in btc, and I seriously doubt any of them are paying their rent/bills/daily needs in btc alone. Furthermore, what do you think bitcoin-accepting businesses are doing with their revenue in bitcoin - turning around and spending it as bitcoin? (please tell me you don't honestly think that) Until complex(especially b2b) trade happens with *only* bitcoins, people will always have the prerogative to exchange for &lt;fiat currency&gt;, and thus horde. Bitcoin is not going to be the only currency for a long long time.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:54:26
Yes, after explaining better, he didn't lose anything. However, if it had gone like this:
* Had 1.65btc (purchased for much less than the exchange rate at the time of his comment, lets say last year for $10)
* Spent 1.65btc it on Nexus 7
* Immediately purchased another 1.65btc *at* current prices
He would have *yes* gotten a nexus 7 for what amounts to 10$, but then he immediately spent *more* than the total price of a nexus 7 in USD by re-buying the 1.65btc at current market rates. *Additionally* if he had never spent the initial 1.65 bitcoin but simply held on to it, he'd have ~3.3 bitcoins, a much wiser choice as the price continues to rise.
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:28:57


I linked the article to disprove your claim here:


Deflation *does* hurt economies, and bitcoin's exchange volatility is not small or controlled by *anyone* but the biggest fish - and they are not benevolent. It *is* an extreme example.


You seem to be using a limited definition of the term "spending". I'm not talking about consumer spending, but rather B2B and financial markets. You know, the kind of thing that keeps the world economy's wheels turning..


Investment will always be necessary for growth, and in turn it creates debt. How is bitcoin going to change this? Not everyone is getting rich off of bitcoin exchange rates, the same issues will persist.


The vast majority of physical goods for sale in exchange for bitcoins are niche non-essentials, but you'd be foolish to buy anything right now with the exchange rate shooting up like it is. Likewise, vendors would be foolish not to immediately convert back to USD to pay for expenses lest the exchange rate drops dramatically(like it did yesterday). 
There's a handful of folks selling anything else(yes, there's a large quantity - but take a good look at them), it barely scratches the surface of what bitcoin needs to be used for.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:17:51
That's nice and all, but what do you think those stores are doing with their bitcoin revenue? You're kidding yourself if you think they're turning around and using the bitcoins themselves in further trade. What bitcoin needs is complex b2b trade conducted *only* with bitcoins, something that is practically nonexistent at this point.

If you DDoS the web-facing itself, it doesn't matter if the exchange application servers are untouched.
