Bitstamp will be my primary once I get verified.  Been waiting 3 weeks now....
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:48:15
Yes it will burst, yes it will recover, yes it will be volatile for the foreseeable future.  We all love double digit percentage increases, but freak at the same level of decreases....until things level out and we see a more normal level of up/down instead of these huge swings, it will be a wild ride both ways.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:55:12
Agreed...just interesting observation with the various threads today.

@_date: 2017-12-26 00:49:45
Should have moved it to GDAX and then to your wallet. It’s free, no fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:30:41
Maybe....people looking to get some FIAT to pay for Christmas.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:55:27
And that sums up the issue with the big financial institutions.....hubris and the attitude of superiority. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:45:53
Bouncing all over...crazy looking and expected as people move between BTC and BCH....it will level out after a few hours.  Just not sure where...

Damn shame....so, what are some of the competitors that all their former workers/miners/hashers should be looking at moving to?
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:51:09
I agree, it will drop hard at some point, we'll see a 20-25% correction.  But, that still puts it at ~$14-15,000.  Crazy....and it will recover and likely go even higher than today.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:54:56
Not saying they did anything wrong, just an observation.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:21:07
There is always risk....nothing is guaranteed.  It all depends on how much risk you are comfortable with.  So, unless you are Ok with losing it all...you may want to rethink things.  I am NOT saying you will...but this is still a very volatile investment that will continue to see very large upswings and downswings.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:36:24
Yeah, don't disagree.  Especially in the US...with the new tax laws coming in 2018 and lower capital gains.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:43:00
Will be interesting to watch the volume and movements. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:51:10
I said this in another thread, but this is my OPINION.
I think the next week will kind of bounce around a bit. People want to see what the rogue Segwit2x nonsense does despite the "call off" of doing it. Also all those that wanted the fork putting money into BCH will create some instability for the week.  My target buy price for about 10 days now is $5,700.

Profits are taxable income.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:23:23
No, you can buy fractions.  I do $100 increments monthly (sometimes more often) which currently equate to about 0.01 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:45:01
I hear ya....been in the same situation for a day or two now and it keeps rising.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:41:33
Man, I have money to invest, but I just can't bring myself to pull the trigger.  My gut tells me this pricing range is going to go back down, but the market the last few days have been saying otherwise.  Conflicted.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:37:16
Was wondering this too if one of the big guys exited or at least lowered their stake.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:15:34
Man, that is one crazy chart.....could induce seizures if you look to closely.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:45:00
Still only futures....they may announce availability date soon.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:31:19
I understand the basis of his views but they are from 20th century. Which were true then but the 21st Century is something different. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:57:00
This thing just keeps going, will we see 7800 today?  My goodness...already passed 7600, will it hold?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:54:56


There are 2 types (falling and rising).  It's a security price pattern where trend lines drawn above and below a price chart converge into an arrow shape. Wedge shaped patterns are thought by technical analysts to be useful in analyzing a short to intermediate term reversal of what the analyst feels to be the major price trend.

I use a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet.  Most prefer holding their coins on their own terms (hardware/paper wallets).
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:43:18
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:31:28
Play the long term game and you'll be fine.....short wins is a great way to go broke.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:03:19
The last 2 hours have seen some bears crapping in the bitcoin woods.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:30:22
It fell quick within the first day or two from $800, then leveled out around ~$200
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:50:59
I think you need to think of it as mBTC than whole coins.  It may even end up being even smaller to be a functional day to day currency.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:39:47
Yep -- if you sell Bitcoin you should report the income/loss.

With the influx of new investors over the last year I bet many have no clue what Mt Gox was or what occurred. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:45:03
Agree -- talk to the pros....
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:13:04
And note it takes 4-5 business days to do the transfer of funds to Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:23:57
Same boat for me...was hoping they'd have shown up, but still pending for over a week now.  Nearly got the timing and price I was looking for.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:10:50
I learned a lot in that...good info.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:14:29
At this point I am waiting it out.....was going to invest some more $$ but the price is rising so fast, I too feel that 10k will be interesting to see what happens, so I will hold for now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:57:47
Its all OPINION!  Take it at face value, always.  No one knows what will happen with any certainty.  You can guess and may win, or could lose.  But, be your own judge of what is in your best interest. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:27:32

@_date: 2017-11-02 22:18:57
Explained it pretty well actually.  Interesting.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:10:40
Its a volatile time...just HODL at this point.  It will work out eventually, could be later today, could be some time in the future.  But, play for the long term regardless.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:04:01
Its right out the playbook of many different people/organizations right now....create the chaos by your actions and then scream at the top of your lungs blaming the other side for its "failure" that you manufactured.  People are lemmings...they will 100% believe whatever that person/group they already "trust" as being on their side of an argument.  So much of life is manufactured now, you shouldn't trust anything without doing your own homework.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:26:30
Sums this up.... 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:48:37
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:55:04
I was thinking about 1200-1300.  ~5700 felt right.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:16:59
This was me....the last few days...driving me nuts.  But now, I think I will just hold and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:25:12
I won't rush, but will be watching.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:31:46
Thought this same thing. Hit my buy level and even went a few hundred below for a short time. Keeping an eye on things now to see what happens next. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:26:24
The world is moving to digital everything...paper currency will eventually go away and all transaction will be done online or via a device (i.e. your smartphone).
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:47:57
Sure it can....but if there is minimal support for it, it will be unprofitable and die eventually.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:48:14
Now it will be interesting to see what the price does...was it growing due to 2x or not....regardless of "impact" perceived one way or another.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:22:45
Not at all, as long as you plan on holding it for a good while.  The long game is the one that will reward the most, IMO.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:51:23
Segwit just do it. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:59:16
Now everyone that was buying to get "free coins" is going to dump.....buying opportunity coming in the next 24-48 hours.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:42:43
Good to hear...it was the right decision.  Work as one to keep advancing the main core....
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:48:45
Not a thing....all good, just HODL through some bumpy times that may be in our near term future.  Long term looks good.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:49:38
Just like all financial issues around death, you need a good documented plan.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:41:15
Well done!
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:53:01
That sums it up nicely on my view and decision too. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:25:35
This is what I do as well.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:25:54
I have yet to sell any....only a buyer so far.  But I pick my times when I buy...so far still doing well.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:49:24
Likely not....as below said, typically 4-5 business days.
