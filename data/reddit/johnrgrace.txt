If mining becomes very profitable more miners will come into the market.  If costs can be covered by the transaction fee income (assuming fees are less than the block reward) more people will pop up to mine driving the profits down given some time for adjustment.

Mostly it costs 5% for a small company because of the fixed cost fees.  A letter of credit is only going to be used for a $1-10k transaction if there are no other choices.  Professionally when I've used a letter of credit the cost was FAR under 1%.

No, because fraudsters still will fraud.  If you still accept other forms of payment fraud costs don't go down.  
Image 1 in 20 customers commits fraud.  Now you accept bitcoins and half your customers use bitcoin.  You are left with 10 customers not using bitcoin, and one of them is going to commit fraud.  Total fraud is still 1 out of 20 customers.

I'm an ex Amazonian, they could easily do this during one of their six to eight week sprints.  The internal software architecture of amazon is that every function, like the shopping cart, has it's own team with a published API that every other function interacts with,  The rule is never break the API and then you can update as fast and often as you want.  
There is a very limited amount of internal sign off or approval, people can move very fast except for a few areas.  If you're doing something that might trigger sales tax collection that will slow you down, or something across multiple bits ie payment shopping cart and product catalog.  
I personally expect you'll see a bit coin option of some sort this year.

Yes, which is a HUGE tax giveaway used by wealthy people.  You don't have to record the capital gains when you gift it to a qualified organization, the donor will not realize any capital gains at the time of the gift, thereby avoiding payment of capital gains taxes on the appreciation. Plus, the value of the donation is the fair market value on the date of the gift, which is deductible from the donor's federal income taxes (up to the IRS limits). 
Further, there are things like  where you can donate into a donor advised charitable trust.

Yes, Amazon will respond it's their corporate DNA.  One of my bosses there in Amazon's early days would have to get a copy of specific newspapers every morning.  These papers had adds from one of the major NYC discount electronics places that that said now $159, $20 less than amazon.  By 5am every morning every price at Amazon in that add would be lower.  
Amazon already is allowed to operate at a loss, they can't possibly not respond.  Don't worry plenty of people at Amazon know game theory and how to do iterative versions of a game.

The estate settlement process is conservative, because there are frequent disputes about the money and everything else.  There are no presumptions about WHO the rightful owners are, because people have multiple wills, children out of wedlock etc.  
Banks let the courts say who the money should go to because they are custodians of those funds, if they give them to the wrong person they will be held liable.   
You could have been named the executor, and walked from bank to bank.  However if in doing so you had not maximized the value for the estate then you could have been open to legal liability.  
Many people set things up so some of their assets don't go through probate exactly because of the problems you've highlighted.

To be a savings account it MUST be limited to 6 withdrawals per month in the US.  Otherwise bank examiners make the assumption that the funds are transactional in mature and a bank then has to hold more reserves because the money could leave faster.

They have two businesses.  
1. Renting Physical items without a person involved, anonymous money creates a huge problem with theft of items.   The possible solution set are all more complex than what they do now.
2. They have a subscription business, Redbox Streaming which is a subscription business.  Most subscription businesses are based on customers paying monthly fee's without making a decision every month.  Their economics are based on people paying every month without the friction of making an actual choice.  Bitcoin is not very compelling for someone with this business.

You could take a tool from the academic finance toolbox, the no arbitrage principle.  Essentially that asset pricing should be such that someone can not make riskless profits.   
Applied to bitcoin, the market price of bitcoins should not be grossly above or bellow the cost to mine coins.  In this case cost would be direct operating cost costs and capital costs factoring in hardware obsolescence uncertainty.  There are of course real world frictions that mean a no arbitrage price isn't going to be reached but over the long term price should hang around these levels.   (this is a highly simplified version of a no arbitrage pricing view).
No arbitrage isn't perfect but it makes some sense that the market price shouldn't be greatly in excess of the cost of production for an extended period of time.   The $1,000 price was far too high given the cost of production at that time.

Amazons doomsday device in books is their in house publishing group, Audible, and KDP.  They can use both to cut off selection from other marketplaces.  
In house publishing has wanted to get blockbuster books like Harry Potter etc. which would always be sold everywhere but COULD be pulled away.  This of course is a weapon that is most effective if it is never used.  
Audible dominates audiobooks, with 90%+ market share.  Anyone wanting to lock another retailer out of the audio side of things has leverage here.  Notice just how much audiobooks are being tied into books with bundles etc.   
KDP, Amazon can change author payments here.  You can see how they pulled back payment percentages from authors in audiobooks.  Force authors to chose between income or being exclusive (or limited in some way that excludes overstocked). 
The thing is using any doomsday device has a high friction cost, I'd suggest sudden short unexpected bursts of discounting for limited periods of time.

It's not a doubling thing.  $105 million USD for a cargo of Oil, compared to the $1.28 trillion of USD is the same size transaction as 1722 bit coins out of 21 million and if the full 21 million don't really circulate or are lost that number drops.  
To be dollar liquid bit coins would have to be something like $100,000 USD to buy and sell oil cargos which also means mining them would have to cost fairly close to $100,000 for a price like that to be realized.

There can be enough value but a coin has to be worth a lot, and if the value of a coin outpaces the cost of mining a coin mining will start to speed up slowing the value increase.  I don't see oil trading being possible until long after the coin limit is reached.  Until the limit is reached the cost of mining will be a lid on price preventing oil trades.  
What will be interesting is the hard 21 million coin limit along with lost coins, you have a deflationary currency; will that work long term? This question had been raised many times here; addressed well fewer times.

A single cargo of Dubai Feteh (~$105 usd/bbl) on a smaller suezmax crude carrier ( 1,000,000 BBL capacity) and a 650 Bitcoin to USD price would cost slightly more than 160,000 Bitcoin.  Bitcoin isn't ready for oil level trade a single oil cargo would involve more than 1% of all mined coins.

But do they have 51% of the voting rights? VC money always has lots of levers that allow them to take control in many situations.  The most basic one is having the board controlled by VC investors.

Maybe not, because they are in Canada they have a fiduciary duty to their depositors to keep their assets safe.  Selling may not eliminate all of that fiduciary duty if the buyers are crooks or fools and the coins get looted, in that case those who lost coins can try and come back to the original sellers and say "hey you should have known those guys were crooks!".  So while you could sell the business for a small amount of money you'd also have a small chance of having to pay out a very large sum of money in the future should the buyers be shady.

If a merchant settles in FIAT for an overpayment they open themselves up for abuse as a mechanism to convert BTC to fiat and potentially bringing them under regulatory scrutiny

Mostly they'll be spending money on code people and lawyers to plug into different parts of the existing financial system so they can act as middlemen between existing financial flows/systems and BTC.  Secondly funding means they can keep transaction fees low/no while they establish themselves as the defacto place to route financial flows in and out of BTC

Which is why a smart thief will offer a huge transaction fee so miners won't revert the transaction.

True but the prosecution has to spend the time proving that IF they are even aware of if.    It's a legitimate legal tactic to spend five minutes throwing out an argument that takes the other side hours/days to undo

First I would start several mining operations, have one group join every pool of size and contribute enough hash power to be a big but not controlling player in each pool.  And start several pools of my own that others are free to join. Goal is to grab over 50% mining power with $10 billion doable.  
Second, after you have the hashing power pass a regulation that business accepting Bitcoin from non white listed addresses have to withhold 35% of amounts for taxes.  Anyone who proves identity gets white listed.  If you whitelist you get the 35% withheld on previous transactions back.  Maybe things could fork here but with loads of hash power staying most won't leave and nothing in the protocol changes.  
Third, let things run for while.  Then after you have enough data you can use whitelist data to figure out who blacklist people are.  Go start arresting people and pulling whitelist coin owners in to figure out who blacklist owners are.  No blacklist owner will want to transact with a whitelist owner and blacklist coins likely become worth less. At the same time offer amnesty and no taxes for brief time if you whitelist coins. 
Fourth, fork.  Blacklist coins no longer transact with whitelist in the protocol without x% of transaction miner fee, and put in mandatory blacklist to blacklist transaction fee for miners.  Greedy miners plus your own hash power means most of the network goes along with this.  Black coins die a quite death because most people don't want to take them.

You've disagreed with my statement "Without proof of deposits, proof of reserves is useless"   Proof of reserves works, it's just not useful.  
If for instance you know someone has proof of 100 coins that information isn't useful unless you also know how many coins were deposited.  If 150 coins were deposited there is a problem, which is unknowable until total deposits are known.

When you talk about credit card processing fee's 3% is a rate that smaller companies pay.  A larger business taking visa/mastercard (no Amex) can get rates in the 2.2% +/- 0.2%
Visa publishes the fee's they charge with banks, and companies can get fairly close to these rates provided they want limited services from a bank.
