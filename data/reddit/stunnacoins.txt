Maybe huge for you or anyone so advanced, but not as extrmeme as ebay sellers are posting .001 for $40 dont get scammed.. Paxful is actually a viable source for btc. Way too many people being know it alls. At the current stae indacoin is down for usa users, an paxful brings a wide viarity of payments you can use.

DOGECOIN I'm out

Owning one btc is almost unbelievable  right now an it's happening once. It's no longer mineable will set a scare. I think the solution will be dogecoin we are already converting too where we don't have too pay tons of fees. Great time to be alive dogecoin is too the moon!
