They should be fine since they can print money out of thin air through Tethers. Why don't they just prove its backed by USD already. Why make the market go through all this shit if you can simply show a bank statement?
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:59:15

u fucking idiots look at the y axis of this shitty graph, it jumps from 0.01 to 0.10 and then straight to 1. It should jump to 0.2 if this is a normal graph w/ ok axis. This axis is like x10 each jump lol, the curve is MUCH MUCH MORE INCLINED THAN THIS. this graph is complete shit and you are ever shitier for believing in your eyes and not doing the math for the axis. lol, from 0,01 to 100,000 thats some exponential axis if i ever seen one. make that jpeg 100 times taller and you will find your true graph. fucking donkey.

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:02:24
Exchange closes. The prices will go down all around I know. But some exchanges may be "riskier" than others to have your money there when, let's say, Tether scandal hits the fan.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:57:11
