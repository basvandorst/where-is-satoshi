Ah, got you. They sound pretty identical except for the share contribution part. Wonder how solo mining is different but it doesn't seem to matter anyways. I guess I'm going to hope for the price to continue going up more than it already has and I'll spend a good bit on rigs, then lose the job and live the life :p

My plan wasn't to live with 100 per day, more so to use this 100 per day to buy more and more miners and eventually making thousands a day. Going on and on and on with this cycle until... who knows.
I understand the competing part, but whats the difference if I'm competing with a small share in a pool vs the total share of all the pools and independent miners? I assume it's lower reward with solo mining when you have low power vs lower reward when pool mining when you have high power? Do solved blocks pay exponentially based on share percentage? so 1% vs 30% doesn't get paid 1% vs 30%? I don't really understand it.

Could you explain why solo mining makes more for high power mining? I couldn't figure out the ratio you were talking about, but I plugged those numbers of 11918845 TH/s and 100TH/s into a miner profit calculator and got around $200 a day. Is that accurate? And does that refer to solo mining or pool mining?

The 1800 daily reward is for pool mining right? Do you know how much the share decreases or does that vary pool to pool?
I believe what I was remembering was the 50/25 BTC block reward and was wondering if there was a chance I could reach that possibility with those miners. And I assume when pool mining you just get the share, no block reward. When you say a warehouse of miners to solo mine, how many in the warehouse to even make getting a block reward possible?
