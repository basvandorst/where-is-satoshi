This is a stage of cancer. ��
The T refers to the size and/or extent of the main tumor. The higher the number after the T, the larger the tumor or the more it has grown into nearby tissues and M1 means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
I call very cheeky troll not happy with BU.
@_date: 2017-03-21 07:47:36
They'll have you believe that to drive the price up only from "them" to sell off just before the announcement. Similat effects as the ETF cash grab.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:19:46
They'll buy or hodl not sell as everyone is predicting, that's what we're all doing so why would China just sell up?

I have a simple plan. 
Soon as x2 snapshot is taken I'm putting my btc coins on the market, when I'm happy with the dip I'll buy back in at a cheaper price for more coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:26:16
Why would anyone sell their BTC for cheaper than they are on the market?
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:49:44
Only to buy back in later though!

I hope that's not sarcasm! But at any cost I'm here to back BTC for good, it's helped me massively these past two years and I owe it back to the community. Most will judge for making decisions based on emotions but it's been a hell of a ride, we're less than $800 away from 10k here in Australia.

If he sells them, we buy them.
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:49:33
Not a stupid question. 
I was just thinking about selling, I feel a little pull back after today. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:39:29
Miners are jumping ship to bcash to make a quick profit. We are under attack. Go over to BTC and read what they're writing. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:53:26
But why are people letting their emotions get the best of them? I'm here for gains.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:49:23
Sell now otherwise suicide.

@_date: 2017-11-12 01:38:21
I've been waiting 10 hours too bro, similar boat.
Had enough, just hoping these miners come back once the difficulty decreases. I would've jumped ship to Bcash last night and not lost a few thousand dollars. I think we're just going to have to wait.

Yeah! I give it three days.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:02:49
But this bitcoin already has blackjack and strippers!
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:38:59
I will always hodl my coins throughout bad news and forks until the ship sinks but the constant fork news gets heavily in the way of the adoption of bitcoin I believe, it's already hostile enough. 
But ATH at the moment probably contradicts this. ��

Bitcoin is my gold, Litecoin is my silver. 
They can coexist quite happily. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:45:34
It's people with your attitude dividing the cryptocurrency community more so than pump and dumpers. By all means keep aiming for the moon with your bitcoins, I'll be waving from Mars with mine and my alts.

I will not be cashing out.
Bitcoin will be the primary accepted global currency one day alongside altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:18:57
You're reply is 100% accurate, rational and logically, I'm in the same boat as you but it seems the majority of people owning bitcoin will make decisions based on their emotions. So I'm asking whether the fear of a Aug 1st hardfork will lead to a panic sell prior to that date, do we take advantage of that or just keep sitting back enjoy the charts eating our popcorn? Or will nothing happen lol.
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:01:38
Surely there will be a panic sell previous to August 1st? I know it's all speculation but seems the general public is in fear of this hard fork.

@_date: 2017-07-17 07:44:37
I really hope all miners signal Elliptic Curve 15, it just makes sense. I don't want to see the price drop again because of the overheated bearings issue. If they don't equip I'm moving my investments elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:04:51
Well that's where I'm at. 
I'm a long time hodler but really I don't have faith in people with bitcoin staying strong this week and hodling, so may as well make a quick profit.
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:27:21
Totally wrong, I am in love with Bitcoin and have several. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 00:03:21
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:37:09
Get in now. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:23:55
Did you mean usurper? 
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:33:33
I really don't think litecoin will ever come close to bitcoin, if anything it might steal the spotlight for a couple of days and we can all get cheap bitcoin. Bitcoin is king at the end of the day and maybe litecoin could be queen. Either way it's so cheap, may as well take a gamble after bitcoin has been so giving.
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:53:05

Thank you for this post.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:31:08
I believe there will be one more dip/panic sell before Aug 1st, everyone will freak out and then we'll be looking at 5k-7k as our next checkpoint to the moon.
I have no evidence to support these beliefs, maybe.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:59:47
They are the real hodlers. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:01:22
Wait what, I just did...
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:10:43
Just bought more bitcoin. All or nothing. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:34:08
It's up from here.
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:46:45
I put in another 2k today, I have zero issues with the charts, I really don't understand the panic, please explain.
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:34:55
When I want small amounts I use coinbase but immediately move to my wallet elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:44:42
I bought 2k's worth today, meh.
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:57:44
Yeah this and slow transaction fees, 
kind of over the ignorance. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 01:11:25
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:42:15
Negative. Just coinbase for small transactions and news agent for larger ones.
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:46:43
To sell.
