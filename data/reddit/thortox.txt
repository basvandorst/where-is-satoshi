It won't let me deposit now with debit card due to high volume. Hopefully it is fixed soon, before it goes back up.

The rise is smaller than in 2013... Are you joking? In 2013 the total value of Bitcoin went up about 11 billion, in the last week Bitcoin has went up over 100 billion. If you think that's sustainable, good luck.

This is what people said at 18k,15k, 12k, 10k, 9k, 8k, 7k, and now 6k. Literally gambling with absolute no skill involved.

And during the Beanie Baby craze there were Beanie Baby shops in every strip mall.

Crypto is just gambling. It skyrocketed and drops randomly. The only way to win consistently is to be big enough to make the market move yourself. If you hold long enough you will end up with close to nothing.

I've been waiting a couple weeks for it to get to 8,5k. I made an account and have it literally ready to buy. I watched it go up after almost pulling the trigger at 9.5k but risked waiting. Now I'm not sure if I should even get in at 8.5k because it feels like everyone is shifting

Lets convert those percentages to dollar value.
672 M - 42 M = 630 Million
147M - 84M = 63 Million
5.5B - 1.1B = 4.4 Billion
24B - 3.5B = 20.5 Billion
105B - 62B = 43 Billion
Total Loss of ALL Previous Crashes Combined = 68 Billion
Total Loss of Current Crash = 220 Billion
Something dropping 94% when its worth a couple dollars and a major difference to losing 50% at 19,000. As you can see above all of the previous major crashes pale in comparison to the recent one.
