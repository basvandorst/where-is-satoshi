My guess:
Monday - Friday, people sit about on line in a self serving echo chamber telling them that they are genius investors and and part of a tech revolution that will change the world and make them richer than Warren Buffet...
Then over the weekend, they venture out into the real world where their friends and family tell them that they are in fact fuckwits!
Over the course of the week, they come back on line an are reassured that they are still rich fuckits and should continue to buy...
They cycle continues.

You may be right. Recent political events in US all over Europe show we are crying out for change, as does the embrace of bitcoin as an anti government stance.

If you're still invested in bitcoin - i would take these point seriously - how much further can the price rise?
Right now the mining infrastructure hasn't caught up with with the rise in rewards after the price jump from the end of last year and there are big profits from mining - if the price goes up further and mining catches up, then the energy consumption will just keep rising.
you may get some double digit percentage returns, but nothing over 100% is likely again let alone the 1000% + returns people have seen in the past....
Is it really worth the risk of hodling for that sort of return when there is a very real possibility that the price will crash!
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:35:29

Well you just need to Google where the biggest bitcoin mines are...
The vast majority are using coal - even the head of bitmain explains why they have moved away from hydro (they need a constant energy source not one that only cheap at certain times)
When it mainly power by coal, calling it a green coin is pure BS!
Yes a small amount is using green energy, but the whole is using a lot of coal
Yes the world is slowly moving away from fossil fuels, but this is not thanks to bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-01-09 16:52:33
I think they already know....
“In the early stages of China’s mining industry, the cost of electricity wasn’t that important. As long as you had industrially priced electricity, you could mine,” explains Su Jiahai, head of mining at Bitmain, a Beijing-based company that owns several cryptocurrency mines in China, including the one we’re touring in Ordos.
That’s changed, he says. Today, Chinese mines not only seek out cheap electricity, but also stability and scale. So instead of siphoning surplus electricity from hydropower stations in Sichuan, say, during the rainy season, larger mines are now partnering with local governments for a steady but discounted supply of energy from the State Grid, China’s state-owned electricity utility.

A miner will have a choice with their BTC rewards - convert back to USD or speculate on the price of BTC.
Profit will always be measure in Fiat.
If they chose to speculate and the price collapses to $10, they are not going be cheered up by the fact that they have technically made a profit in BTC.
They care about Real Money. Same as 99% of Bitcoin Hodlers - they are just hoping their stash become worth more USD.

It was a great idea - and i am very interested in the crypto space.
But size, it has become clear that bitcoin energy use is far to high and wont be scalable. The sooner is crashes the better the environment will be. Instead of seeing a weakness and improving all that happens is a blanket denial and load of lies.
Plus I feel a bit bad for all the suckers that will be on the end eating the huge losses when it all goes down.
The longer this goes on, the more the whales can offload onto the people that are investing more that they should be.

There is a simple way to think about this:
Bitcoin currently uses as much electricity as Iraq.
Bitcoin with this amount of energy manages to support a payments system that can handle 400,000 transactions per day. 
That same amount of electricity can power the homes of Iraqs 38 million people, power their financial system and print all their cash supporting multiple millions of transactions per day, it also powers their office buildings, schools, street lights, airports and hospitals...
If you think that bitcoin would look good in a fair comparison, then you are deluded!

Some is mined with green energy - a lot isnt.
Miners want a constant source of energy to maximise profit from their hardware - not just to run when there is cheap excess when its windy, the sun is shining, or the tide is going out...
24/7 access often means being plugged into the grid and using the mix available in the county you are in.
Also if the mining demand for electricity is already more than hydro can handle - then that's worrying - what would happen if the price went to $100k???
This tech is not scalable unless the energy issue is fixed rather than just denied!
P.s. I'm sure Greenpeace are smart enough to see through AA's bullshit video
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:02:31
There is nothing to justify its current price. It has stopped having a cost effective practical purpose and there are a vast array of competitor coins that are better for practical purposes. All that bitcoin has left is as an investment and once people stop believing it will go up and that fails, then we will see a real crash. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:55:48
the difficulty is a function of the price - not vice versa
The China banning FUD is just that - mining will happen somewhere
The total money spent on mining will in the long term be a function of the rewards to miners. Currently the rewards are about $40 million per day.
A good chunk of that is spent on electricity - hard to know what percentage.
At present very little mining is powered by renewables.
Any points of disagreement on those before we move on to the "value of bitcoin"?

The people that made the most money from bitcoin were the ones who got in early (obvs) - they were the ones genuinely interested in crypto - the ones doing it for passion.
Later a lot of people have jumped in to try and profit and have done very well, but nothing like the gains of the early adopters, and those who jump in now risk getting burned.
Find something you are passionate about and get involved rather than just looking to turn a buck. When you do that you'll know what looks good for yourself and will see the opportunities first.
plus if that fails, you've done something you enjoy.
Best of luck to you, but i'd advise against jumping on this particular bandwagon...

@_date: 2018-01-23 16:09:19
There are plenty of other uses for that energy - if they discount it enough i'm sure that they could get a datacentre to utilise it.
There is a lot of money in bitcoin, so they are trying to get them in to pay more. but for every kWh of green that bitcoin uses, there is someone else using fossil fuel that could have used it. Fact is we have a limited amount of green energy that is a lot smaller than global demand, so any excessive use of energy is a bad thing.
Ultimately this will also come down to whether this was just a speculative bubble or a real socioeconomic revolution.
If all the Nobel prize winning economists are correct, then its all been a massive fucking waste of energy.
If the snakeoil salesmen and reddit hodlers are correct, then is not a complete waste, just a lot higher than it needs to be.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:05:35
Simple supply and demand!
when you factor in that mining revenue is about $30 million per day, and that the miners and whales are sat on tons of bitcoins that they would much rather hold is good ol' fashioned fiat, then you realise that there needs to be over $30 million dollars of new fools money coming in per day, just for the price to stay afloat.

Its worth remembering that along with the cost of transactions vendors will also consider the effort involved.
Its technically free for vendors to accept cash - there are no fees, so if some on pays you 1 dollar you get 1 dollar. But many vendors still prefer visa with its fees, because when you factor in the time costs of counting out change, cashing up and going to the bank, then if becomes more of a cost than visas fees.
In the crypto payments space, there will be a lot more faff and time costs of managing channels, converting to fiat, ensursing cyber security, checking payments have been confirmed etc, etc.
Cant see this being a good value proposition for vendors at the present state.

Pembury Tavern and OK Cupid no longer accept Bitcoin!
I'm not going to check the rest of the list, but there are probably more!
Reality is that its not widely used and has got worse not better. Its now just a tool for speculation.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:03:43
You could do some probability analysis...
Basically the 21 million scarcity argument only holds up if bitcoin is widely adopted and people need to use it to transact. Otherwise it's just like plenty of other scarce things, baseball cards, limited edition sneakers, first edition Harry Potter books, etc... (only valuable if people want to pay for the sheer joy of ownership)
So if bitcoin becomes the widely used currency, then assign a value based on cash in the world divided by 21 million. I think I saw a figure of around $2 million for this case.
Otherwise, it's pretty worthless in the long run, let's say $500 to be generous.
So what is the probability that we will all abandon fiat in the next 30 years?
Petty low - say 2%
Next, if that did happen, what is the probability that if we did abandon fiat, that we'd use bitcoin - a crypto that can handle 4 transactions a second? (I know, I know, Lighting Network - but it would take 400 years to open channels for even half the people in the world)
Pretty low again - say 2%
Put that all together and you get value now of $1,300
Feel free to plug your own values and odds in, but it feels grossly overvalued right now...

Imagine Lightning works great and really takes off, people love it an vendors are supper excited to accept LN transactions in their shops.
Its all good, right?
But People cant open bitcoin LN channels fast enough, and then they start using LN with a different, faster, more scalable coin.
Demand for whatevercoin skyrockets and the price goes through the roof - The market cap tips bitcoin to the number 1 spot and people start to question bitcoins dominance. More and More people switch to whatevercoins because they can actually open channels with them and its bye bye bitcoin.
If LN takes off before bitcoin does something about its on-chain scaling issues - It might be fucked!
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:23:57
Yep - someone else beat you to that one, but was a fair bit less snooty about it...
still doesn't sound very scalable though - People will probably use a different coin than bitcoin.

What "facts" ? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:32:40
1. People are investing in bitcoin with money that they can afford to lose, there is no evidence that they are spending less, they are just keeping hold of their investments which is very normal practice. Also the rapid rise has led to some buying lambos, so this this argument is nonsense.
2. On a like for like basis adjusted for size bitcoin uses a lot more energy to do a lot less. Plus as of yet it has not replaced any of our traditional finance so is energy use on top of it, so this is also nonsense. 
3. A tiny fraction of bitcoin is mined with renewables and with current prices and storage/availability issues its likely to remain under 50% for some time. Even if it was all renewable the consumption of resources for mining rigs and buildings to house them mean that it can never be "good" for the environment. This is nonsense too.
TL;DR - the whole thing is pure BS!

If they are not implemented before LN takes off - it may be too late as another coin might be dominant by then.
Also even if you do all that and increase the block size 4x - you could get to 100 tx/second, but that would still not be enough for global usage, and LTC can already manage 56 tx/s
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:26:17
So - as others have pointed out, the hashpower in the network right now is well in excess of what is required to secure the network.
This is purely a function of the vast rewards for miners.
in a similar way to difficulty being regulated to maintain the block frequency - What if the mining rewards were regulated to ensure that the hash rate was just enough to secure the network + a buffer and not more?
You could keep the cap at 21 million and if anything - this would result in less BTC in the short term, which would mean they are more scarce so worth more...

Inflation : "a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money"
It has nothing to do with the amount in circulation!
Over the last 3 days, the price of goods in bitcoin has increased and its purchasing power has fallen - thats inflation.

just because some is using green energy does not make the whole thing good.
Miners have 2 main costs hardware and electricity - to maximize the returns on their hardware - they want to be running 24-7 - not just when their is a surplus of hydro, wind or sun....
You'll pretty much find that mining consumption will mirror the energy mix of the country they are mined in. Its great that Canada has a lot of green energy - but bitcoin gets no credit for that!
Plus, the same argument can be made for any use of electricity - so its pretty much rubbish.

Have a look at the fees for bitcoin right now - how much would bitcoin have to rise for you to put $50 and get $50 back when you cash out, once you factor in the fees?
ltc and eth will probably suffer some contagion in the event of a crash, so probably not good timing for those either.
But i may be wrong and we'll have some increase yet - doubt it will be more than 2x and after fees ltc or eth will be much better on an investment of $50
both are also less bad for the environment than btc - so you can feel good about that too!

Bitcoin is number 1, but it might not be the best tech.
Logically if bitcoin were to crash, it should be good for its "competitors", but in reality a big crash in bitcoin would likely dent confidence in the whole crypto market and all will fall in value.

so now we get to how much bitcoin is worth...
in the short term, its just how much people are willing to pay for it - so a lot - thats pretty basic.
In the long term it should move towards its real value... to guess what this is - we need to define what we think bitcoin is going to be.
some think its a currency - but its not doing a good job at that already and there are scaling issues ahead. even with LN i don't think it can scale as the core can only handle enough on chain transaction for every person in america to top up a channel once every 10 years.
I think LN is a good theory that is being banded around to assuage peoples scalability concerns and pump the value in the short term, but will fail in practice.
That leaves other peoples views that its the new digital gold and that's a dangerous path as that is pure speculation on an asset with no real intrinsic value - so there is no fundamental floor to the price if it falls.
Where do you stand? Currency of the future, digital gold? or something else?

Sorry to hear your loss. 
Bitcoin is a very clever way to trade digital tokens, but they are fundamentally worthless. In the long run it will be a zero sum game. For every dollar someone makes some one will lose a dollar. Hopefully this dip will teach a valuable lesson before more people put their savings or even worse credit into this get rich quick scheme
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:36:09
You could do some probability analysis...
Basically the 21 million scarcity argument only holds up if bitcoin is widely adopted and people need to use it to transact. Otherwise it's just like plenty of other scarce things, baseball cards, limited edition sneakers, first edition Harry Potter books, etc... (only valuable if people want to pay for the sheer joy of ownership) 
So if bitcoin becomes the widely used currency, then assign a value based on cash in the world divided by 21 million. I think I saw a figure of around $2 million for this case. 
Otherwise, it's pretty worthless in the long run, let's say $500 to be generous.
So what is the probability that we will all abandon fiat in the next 30 years? 
Petty low - say 2%
Next, if that did happen, what is the probability that if we did abandon fiat, that we'd use bitcoin - a crypto that can handle 4 transactions a second? (I know, I know, Lighting Network - but it would take 400 years to open channels for even half the people in the world) 
Pretty low again - say 2%
Put that all together and you get value now of $1,300

LN and scaling wont be possible when the core chain can only handle 400k transactions a day.
Even with the plans, that is not going any where near high enough to make scaling possible.
You don't need little tech tweeks - you need some fundamental change. Bitcoin hates change - so is more focused on talking up what it could be...
There is a lot of talk and not much practical use for bitcoin - this was wash for a while, but cant last indefinitely! 
EDT : Also do people even want a wallet that opens up channels automatically? every time you open/close a channel - you are transacting with the blockchain and there will still be big fees for that...

an increase in money supply can cause inflation - the price of commodities such as oil, wheat and steel can also cause inflation.
a price decrease in the currency of which you are measuring can cause inflation. in the UK they have the Pound, but buy lots of stuff from Europe in EUR and oil priced in USD. If the pound falls in value compared to EUR and USD, then things become more expensive in GBP - that's GBP inflation!
Same applies to Bitcoin - when the price of bitcoin falls, things become more expensive in Bitcoin - That's Bitcoin inflation.
That bit is quite simple really...
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:49:58
that's a very unique use case and would account for a tiny fraction of bitcoin mining. The vast majority is not using renewables!

Bitcoin currently uses a similar amount of electricity to Denmark (will be more if price stays where it is or rises);

Denmark uses the same amount of electricity to process the daily transactions of 5.5 million people
power the homes of 5,593,785 people
power demarks banks, central banks and money processing
power demarks office building, industry, hospitals, schools etc
power all of denmarks street lighting..... Etc... Etc...

Assuming this happens before June 2020 (half the rewards after that):
Annual rewards for mining will be $300,000 per coin, 12.5 coins per block, 6 blocks per hour, 24 hours, 365 days...
That amounts to around $200 billion usd per year in incentives to mine bitcoin before you even factor in fees.
Lets be conservative and say the miners being smart and anticipating the the 2020 halving are only willing to spend 30% of that on mining and are making 70% profit...
That means around $60 billion would be spent in mining costs.
Again a conservative estimate that 60% of that is spent on electricity (this completely ignores the energy and materials to make the mining rigs)
That leaves ~ $35 billion on electricty per year.
miners in china using cheap coal are paying about 4c per kWH, but we can be conservative and say this goes up to 6c.
that give 591 TWh per year mining bitcoin.
Thats 17 times more that it does now, and more than all but 5 countries in the world.
If you then bare in mind that at that point its total value had not even come close to half of the US money supply, then its pretty clear that this is not the currency of the future.

The amount of money spent on mining (mostly electricity) will tend toward the revenue from mining.
If computers energy efficiency doubles, then mining get cheaper, which leads to more profit, which leads to more mining rigs competing. 
In the long run computing efficiency will not help the energy consumption of mining bitcoin. 
In its current form, this tech is just not scalable!

And to answer you question - at what point of mass adoption do YOU think the current power consumption is justified?
The only way for the current power consumption could be justified would be if we had the same consumption BUT with mass adoption and wide scale usage.
This however would require a change to the current mining reward stucture - as any mass adoption will lead to significant price increase / mining reward increase / mining energy.
Bitcoin as a currency is pretty shite at the moment, but if it became good and widely adopted, then the price would go to the moon. At that point, with the current mining rewards, it would be an environmental disaster...

Think of it this way: Bitcoin currently uses a similar amount of electricity to Denmark (will be more if price stays where it is or rises);
Bitcoin uses this to process 350,000 transactions per day
Denmark uses the same amount of electricity to process the daily transactions of 5.5 million people 
+ power the homes of 5,593,785 people 
+ power demarks banks, central banks and money processing 
+ power demarks office building, industry, hospitals, schools etc

You sir are entirely correct!
But have a little read about the energy consumption by bitcoin. Once you realise that the network already uses more electricity than Google and that a single transaction could power your house for 2 weeks, then you will see that major retailers will never adopt it.
There is already pressure on big companies to reduce their carbon footprints so there is very little change that they will be associated with Bitcoin once people are aware of its environmental impact.

@_date: 2017-12-07 12:01:32
If you are concerned about bitcoin maintaining its value, the the primary thing you need to consider is its utility as currency/ledger/transfer mechanism. 
The investment/speculation mindset is not sustainable in the long term - at some point it will either pop like a bubble or settle to a fair value based on its utility.
If you do not want it to pop - then the concern needs to be on its utility.
Right now there are very few places to spend bitcoin and major companies are actually stopping accepting it (
Transaction costs right now are both far too high to the consumer and to the environment.
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency have great potential, but you need to be focused on that rather just betting on its value.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:12:56
I think some people are starting to realize that there is a problem that needs to be fixed.
Some people on the other hand (the ones who dont get simple science) refuse to listen or think for themselves.
You might want to pay attention though as if bitcoin does not sort out its energy problem, then its price will tank at some point.

I'm not sure that learning about bitcoin will help its value. 
If someone buys one, tries to spend it and then realizes that no one-accepts in anymore, tries to transfer it and looses a huge chunk in fees, then goes on line to do some research and realize that their 1 transaction uses more electricity than their house does in two weeks....
Maybe if people could invest in the bubble without having to touch bitcoin then you can pump this a bit higher.....
lets see how the futures contracts work ;)
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:49:25
Its honestly just about the planet - I have no issues with less energy intensive cryptos.
If you care about crypto and the planet - ditch bitcoin that doesn't function anyway and support something better.
Bitcoin maybe global, but it is not widely used. Its energy consumption will be proportional to its price, so it can never be widely adopted without consuming half the worlds electricity.
I just wish people would take their fingers out of their ears and put their faith in better technology.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:35:38
There is no simple upgrade to fix this and bitcoin doesn't have the best track record in terms of making changes...
In the long run the total energy spent mining will always be a significant fraction of the mining revenue. The mining revenue in USD = 12.5 (block reward) * 144 (blocks per day) * the price of a bitcoin in usd
(I've excused fees for simplicity but including them would paint a worse picture) 
As such the energy spent mining is proportional to the price in the long run.
Now the reward per block does half every 4 year's, but that would mean that the bitcoin price could only rise at 20% per year without increasing the networks CO2 emissions.
If it stabilises where it is now then it will already more than double its emissions from today which are the equivalent of all of Denmark.. 
On the point of fixes - the only feasible on is to move away from POW as if the mining effort required were to fall significantly to reduce emissions then the already bloated networks calculation capacity would render it vulnerable to attack. 
Please think long and hard about the risk of your investments both to your finances and to our planet. 
All the best :)

Bitcoin is open source and can be copied perfectly.
Gold as an element is unique and cannot be copied. Other elements will have different properties.
Scarcity adds value when lots of people want the same thing that has limited availability and no (or lesser) alternatives.
If you leave out bitcoin as a speculative bubble, then if you want to actually use it then there are plenty (and better or identical) alternatives.
Oh - I want to buy a new foil hat online, but am fundamentally opposed to government and there are not many bitcoins around...

was trying to lead you in the right direction to figure it out by yourself....
If mining becomes more profitable, then more energy will be spent mining. The reward structure for mining and the algorithm to alter the difficulty to modulate blocks to ~10 minute intervals mean than in the long run improvements in efficiency will just result in increased difficulty, rather than less energy being used.
You were getting so close - I'll give you a C- for effort.

1 example of something that uses power less efficiently?
I get the feeling you can't name one! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:25:24
the halving was factored in into the miners only expecting to spend 30% of revenue mining and 2024 is irrelevant at as the payback period of a rig is much less than 4y.
These numbers are quite conservative as was 300k for a post adoption price.
This is just an illustration of what could happen.
There is no need for bitcoin to use this much energy to achieve that kind of adoption, but it would require a change.
If i were considering in investing in bitcoin i would want to make sure that changes were going to occur.

Non renewable power stations like coal can adjust to demand.
Renewables like solar, hydro and wind, cant easily adjust and often have surplus energy which is cheap, but its often expensive at other times and is not a consistent source of power so is not favored by a lot of miners.
Cheap and constant at the moment sadly means coal for the most part.

As one of the most vocal people on this sub about bitcoins energy usage (check my history) - I have to say that forecast of all the worlds energy by 2020 is utter nonsense.
Crazy claims like that don't help anyone and can often hurt their own cause by making their own argument look stupid.
I do think that Digiconomists estimates are in the right ballpark and that bitcoin has an energy problem that needs to be fixed if it is to scale.
In the long run, as per the method Digiconomist uses, the amount of money spent on electricity mining will be a function of the rewards from mining - that's just common sense.
And from there its easy to see that the rewards from mining are a function of its price.
Not too long ago it was estimated that bitcoin was using 0.1% of the worlds electricity capacity - for it to reach 100% of the capacity in 2020 the price of bitcoin would have to reach $10million and not even the most extreme Hodlers are forecasting that!
Its an efficient system right now and is considered by people like me to be wastefull - but its not a full blown world disaster yet. 
My hope is that more people will see that its a problem and do something to fix it. (it can be fixed)
P.s. please no one post that Andreas video where he says its all clean hydro energy as its simply not true...
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:18:55
I knew we'd agree on something eventually ;)
The increase in hashrate is not needed, but will continue with a rise in price...
If bitcoin can alter the reward structure so that the total energy spent is stable, then it has a small shot at success while staying secure.
It would also need to sort out the issue with fees and usability and maybe one day in the future it will have more transactions and the same energy use and it will seem reasonable.
That would take them acknowledging that there is an issue and doing something about it though - so i wont hold my breath.

@_date: 2017-12-15 10:19:37
There is no real reason that the energy of bitcoin needs to be as high as it is. Its just a function of the rewards given to miners and then supply and demand will ensure that the amount spent on mining (mostly electricity) is close to the rewards from mining.
There is a fixed reward per block 12.5 BTC (halving every 4 years) and bitcoin varies the difficulty to regulate each new block to around 1 every 10 minutes.
At the moment the rewards from mining are over $200k per block and over $300million per day - that means a ton of electricity and pollution.
There is no reason the rewards to miners need to be this high - the difficulty level and amount of mining is already far more than is required to keep the network secure.
If bitcoin varied the reward to ensure only the required amount of mining was incentivised then it would only require a fraction of what it does / will do as the price rises.
Hence Bitcoins energy use is excessive compared to what is requires as well as excessive compared to normal alternatives.

Do other transactional systems use less? Of course the do!!!
Think of it this way:
Bitcoin currently uses a similar amount of electricity to Denmark (will be more if price stays where it is or rises);
Bitcoin uses this to process 350,000 transactions per day
Denmark uses the same amount of electricity to process the daily transactions of 5.5 million people
+ power the homes of 5,593,785 people
+ power demarks banks, central banks and money processing
+ power demarks office building, industry, hospitals, schools etc
+ power all of denmarks street lighting.....
I hope you get the point!

Zornaq Article is pretty stale. It was written when the hash rate was 3250 PH/s
Hash rate is now about 4.5 times greater than that, so you need to scale the estimates by around 4.5 x
Since that was written Digiconomist have improved their menthodology and downgraded the estimates.
You'll find there is not much difference between the two.
Bitcoin either uses as much electricity as Denmark or as Ecuador.
Either way it is a colossally wasteful amount of energy for a currency that is only used for price speculation!!!

A good thread with both sides of the argument on this one:
That figure is per transaction - in reality it will be slightly lower than that, but if the price of a bitcoin stays the same or increases it will go up from there.
The energy spent is not really "per transaction", but the total energy used by the network divided by the number of transactions 350 - 400k...
This stems from the incentives for miners - at $17,000 per coin, the daily reward for miners is $17,000/ coin * 12.5 coins/block * 6 blocks/hour 8 24h/day = $30.6 million dollars!
On a daily basis miners are using vast amounts of electricty per day competing for that.
Divide by transactions/day and you get that figure
Since the energy used will rise with the price of a coin - it is clear to everyone apart from those pumping bitcoin that it is not scalable in its current form.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:51:57
Yeah - that counts.

Cant believe that they didn't get it....
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:39:59
It's the other way round...
Supply and demand (speculation) are driving the price of bitcoin. In the long run the amount spent on mining will rise or fall to meet the total mining revenue.
At current prices this would be $17,000 per coin x 12.5 coins per block x 144 blocks per day = around $31 million plus fees.
So in the long run this will justify an amount slightly less than this in mining costs (slightly less to factor in cost of capital and the expected returns of the inherent risks) 
Let's be Conservative and say 60% of the rewards = the current price then justifies around $18,000,000 per day spent mining
Again a Conservative estimate of 2/3 electricity cost and you get a justified $12 million per day electricity or $4.4 billion per year. 
This is a huge amount of electricity and is not great for the environment. 
(note that is the energy justified by the current price and the will naturally be some lag) 
Plus if you follow the maths, you'll see it goes up with the price of bitcoin. 
So everyone hoping for  price rise and the moon is also hoping for a pretty bad scenario for the planet... 
@_date: 2018-09-06 11:59:55
ok, so it was just BS.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:13:36

USD only has intrinsic value equal to the medium of physical coins and notes, copper, nickel, etc... 
I take it you have now Googled intrinsic value and realise that what you were saying about wasted electricity being intrinsic value is bullshit. 
Did you Google where the biggest bitcoin mines are??? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:40:48
Also to put that 591 TWh / per year from bitcoin @ $300,000 into context:
Global production of cash and coins consumes an estimated 11 terawatt-hours per year, while gold mining burns the equivalent of 132 terawatt-hours
So even by that point it would be using 4 times more energy than all the cash and gold production in the world!
and 100 times more electricity than Google
That is not progress!
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:57:29

If you had any idea what you were talking about, then you'd know that in the last 3 years that hash rate had increased 47 fold, while there is only 5 times the number of transactions.

The smart money has given up on making bitcoin functional or scalable and is now just trying to sell what they have for as much as they can to the not-so-smart money.

"Bitcoin industry insiders have issued an optimistic prediction for the cryptocurrency over the next few decades...."
So its valuable and scarce because Bitcoin industry leaders say it is.....
Where can i buy some?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:59:45
What is it if its not a currency?
Maybe it has some utility in the same ways a lottery ticket does - in that you are buying a dream - but that wont sustain its price...
scarcity - its not really scarce when there are thousands of crptocurrencies and more popping up every day - Fail
durability - not very, with hacks, lost keys, and the threat of a 51% attack if the mining rewards ever drop from a long term sustained level - Boarderline on this one
divisibility - Bitcoin passes this one, but plenty of things are divisible like a blank sheet of paper
transferability - Read all the comments on here compaining about transfers taking 10's of hours and costing 10's of dollars ( - Bitcoin gets a fail here.
fungibility - the opposite of divisibility - Bitcoin gets a pass here - but then so does play-doh - so nothing to brag about.
And you missed 1 key facet of any good money - acceptability - any shop i goes to accpets my money - no where really accepts bitcoin any more (before you bring up Microsoft or Expedia or that one pub in london - they have all stopped)
So 2.5 out of 6 - A solid fail as a "Money"
All that is left is an investment - and its an investment in nothing (that always ends the same way)

The assertion is that the majority of mining is coal.
A small renewable outfit with 50 computers does not dispel that!
This one run by coal in China has 25,000 machines:
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:11:06
Renewables are forecast to only be 20% of the world's energy generation by 2040, so being able to rely on clean energy is a long way off. Plus every kW of clean energy used by bitcoin is not being used somewhere else so regardless of where its mined the additional demand on a strained capacity is bad news...
Quantum computing is worrying people for the security of bitcoin, so don't know about that.
And in terms of computing efficiency gain, this has very little impact as supply and demand will see that the cost of mining approximates to the rewards. If mining gets easier, then there will be more competition and the bitcoin calculation will get harder to regulate the frequency of new  blocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:05:00
Then just google Denmark. It has a very strong financial sector.
There is no global comparison, because Bitcoin only handles 350,000 transactions a day whereas the rest of the world handles billions.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:28:08
Has Bitcoin done anything about its energy usage? No
Have more people started talking about Bitcoins energy use? Yes
Hopefully more people will start understanding and believing and either something will change or this bubble of an environmental disaster will burst!

You are right of course - Bitcoin investing consists of buying and holding while either preaching that it is the currency of the future or that it is a great investment.
Meanwhile major retailers are quietly stopping accepting bitcoin and the electricity consumption and CO2 emissions are quietly going through the roof....

@_date: 2017-12-06 17:01:49
its a forum about bitcoin - no?
I'm genuinely curious - its quite clear to me that the failings of the tech mean it cannot scale - yet the price rises.
Its pretty clear that people are just pumping this thing to make money from the greater fool at the end. 
I fear that a lot of people would agree with me, but the game is to hype this thing to keep the suckers buying.
just thought it would be good to engage with the bitcoin community and see how much awareness there is as to the flaws....
its either very little (or people are just being tight lipped to keep the game going)
Whenever you have views on something its always a good idea to seek out opposing views - you'll make better decisions. Sadly the people buying into bitcoin seem to just blindly dismiss anything that they dont like the sound of,,,

Will be very happy if something is done to fix the energy consumption or if the bubble bursts and a better crypto takes its place.
Not jealous, I'm very fortunate with my current income. Not worried about missing the boat, I did my research a long time ago and I wouldn't invest in anything that is only profitable by using more and more energy.

Energy usage is proportional to the rewards from mining and in turn the price of bitcoin.
A 2nd layer solution, may or may not help with fees and with the number of transactions, but wont help the total energy use go down.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:27:33
The energy usage in the long term is function of the mining rewards. If the price stays where it is, then consumption will rise to nearly 0.5% of World consumption...
If it goes to $100k in the next four years it will pass 2%
And when you consider how many transactions it can handle, then that is just plain obscene!
It's clear that this iteration cannot scale. And if it can't go up then there is only 1 way it can go.... 
Get your money out while you can!
And if your in this for idealogical reasons, then put it into a much better crypto, that is not harmful and can scale.

I can't believe you're still struggling with this!
(and lashing out like a child as usual) 
Renewables won't be the majority for a good while yet... 
So if bitcoin scaled infinity as you say and hit 1million then the rewards would be 12.5 million per block, 6  blocks an hour = 1.8 billion USD per day in mining rewards. 
Now if you think about how much electricity would be spent mining for that reward, then it should be clear to all but the biggest idiot that bitcoin can't scale infinitely!
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:30:25
That would be great, but as it says, it would require ditching POW, and i cant see bitcoin doing than.
The best outcome for the planet is that the bitcoin bubble pops and one of the better, greener, cheaper, faster alt coins takes over!

We can then follow it through to how much electricity the entire network will consume...

@_date: 2017-12-15 13:20:22
Do you think Bitcoin can/will change?
Or do you think it will be another crypto that becomes successful (in terms of use - not price)
It seems that the bitcoin core is very reluctant to make any changes .
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:01:58
True - it's probably more than that!
If you're genuinely interested I can run through the maths and you can challenge any assumptions made?
In my opinion the more people understand bitcoin the better.

But it remains that the electricity that powers 350,000 transactions on bitcoin can power all of Denmarks of millions of transactions plus millions of homes etc
Bitcoin is in the realms of grossly wasteful right now, but unless the implementation of it changes it cannot become widely adopted without becoming a full blown environmental catastrophe.

You have anything to back it up?

got any evidence of that?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:22:47
The article is completely correct.
What is does miss out though - is that in the long run the energy consumed by the network will be proportional to the price of a bitcoin.
(mining revenue in BTC is constant and supply and demand will result in the cost of mining - which is mostly electricity - staying close to the mining revenue)
The Bitcoin network already uses much more electricity than google and it will get much worse if it grows.
@_date: 2018-09-13 08:35:00

@_date: 2018-09-06 08:50:09
That is simply not true!
Visa uses around 675,000 per year of energy globally for all its operations, that's ~0.19 tWh a year.
Bitcoin uses somewhere between 57 and 73 tWh a year
So Bitcoin uses at least 300x as much as visa!
(Bitcoin handles 300,000 transactions a day, Visa handles 300,000,000 transactions a day)

That is absolute BS!!!
Bitcoin currently only handles 350,000 transactions a day and it's energy consumption will continue to rise in relation to its price... 
Think of it this way: Bitcoin currently uses a similar amount of electricity to Denmark (will be more if price stays where it is or rises);
Bitcoin uses this to process 350,000 transactions per day
Denmark uses the same amount of electricity to process the daily transactions of 5.5 million people 
+ power the homes of 5,593,785 people 
+ power demarks banks, central banks and money processing 
+ power demarks office building, industry, hospitals, schools etc 
+ power all of denmarks street lighting.....
Etc... Etc... 
I hope you get the point!
If anyone thinks bitcoin can possibly scale or if the amount of energy used to sustain this farce is at all reasonable then they really are delusional...
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:52:57
Lols - "speculation helps to inflate the value of bitcoin" :)
Speculation is the entire value of bitcoin!
Without speculation the price would be less than $10
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:48:02
In that scenario - what do you think the price of Bitcoin will be?
And at that price what will the annual mining rewards be?
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:21:14
It doesn't demand it, but it does incentivize it!
There are currently over $30 million dollars or rewards per day for people to run energy guzzling mining machines playing an ever more complex game of guess the code.
That is quite compelling and all because of the insane and unnecessary reward structure. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:08:06
In the long run, futures and etf's won't have much of an impact on the price of bitcoin (they're just vessels for speculating on its value )  
What will effect the price is its usage in terms of transactions and fund transfers - and right now bitcoin is not doing well on those fronts....

Bitcoin is a speculative investment / gamble, not a hedge for inflation. The only real thing you can do is diversify. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:54:44
You mean inflation as in the purchasing power of money "a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money"?
Again, USD is much more predictable!
The inflation rate of bitcoin has been 30% in the last month alone.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:58:24
I'll second that!!!
I also like to provide some small shred of balance on here to give newbies half a chance.
There are a lot of factually incorrect arguments like the suggestion that bitcoin (which just experienced 100% yoy price inflation) is a good hedge against inflation???
Its just a very speculative asset that has gone up loads and down loads, its a gamble pure and simple.
Happy for people to gamble their money and win or lose, but don't like too see people manipulated into thinking its a good way to save.

why? inflation is much more meaningful!!
If i'm going to hold on to something to use as money, then the amount goods i can buy with it is much more important than the amount of it in existence!
There is a vast amount of misunderstanding of inflation on this sub reddit that demonstrates why you should not learn econ and finance from the same person that is trying to sell to you.

@_date: 2018-11-23 16:58:04
when (normal) people refer to inflation they refer to price inflation.
Do a Google news search for the term inflation and you'll see the results all refer to price inflation rather than monetary inflation.
This is because it is Price inflation that people really care about and price inflation that hits peoples wallets! Google US inflation rate and you'll see it is 2.5% - i.e. over the past year goods have gotten on average 2.5% more expensive. (again this is PRICE inflation)
Now over the past year how much more expensive have goods got in BTC?

This is a perfect example of the misleading statements spread, so i can only guess you are one of those trying to mislead or one that has been misled.
When people refer to inflation (do a Google news search) they are referring to price inflation, which is about how much your 'money' buys not how much of there is in existence.
This is what people feel in their wallets and actually care about. 
The inflation rate of btc has fluctuated wildly from hyperdeflation to hyperinflation.
USD inflation is fairly stable in the 1-3% region.
The insistence on focussing on monetary inflation/money supply is just some bait and switch to distract from the actual inflation and onto some theory that clearly is not holding

Im not sure that you understand what inflation means...
Did you get your definition from r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:33:49
Its a bit of a simplification, but essentially it will always hold roughly true; mining revenue (12.5 BTC per block at around 1 every 10 minutes) is now at about $11million per day and roughly a third of this  will be spent on electricty.
342 thousand transactions a day, so about $11 worth of electricty per transaction.
This will then vary with the BTC price - if the price goes up, mining becomes more profitable, more enengy will be spent on mining and the difficulty goes up creating a new equilibrium.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:28:30
all of them?
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:06:35
17.4  - The number of U.S. households powered for 1 day by the electricity consumed for a single transaction.

coal and natural gas still make up over 50% of electricty:
Would be lovely to thing all the miners are spending thier profit on making the world a better place, but thats a little nieve.
bitcoin is using energy - not bringing it. it already creates as much emmision as 6 million cars and its not widely used. If the usage grew and the price grew then this would be catestrophic for the planet.
for example if the US universally adopted bitcoin, the price would rise to over $800,000 due to the limited supply and at this price the emmisions would be that of 1 billion cars.
The question then is - if Bitcoin cannot realistically grow massive without killing the planet, then what next?
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:45:21
if that maths is right then mining would be making a fortune. There are many ways to estimate the energy used, but its fair to say that percentage of mining revenue will remain stable long term. 
estimates around 200kWh per transaction
 
estimates 211kWh per transaction
even if it were only 19 kWh, then an amount of electricty enough to power a house for a day is still crazy just to process 1 transaction...

@_date: 2017-10-19 10:55:59
another estimate from March:
this had it as 26 kWh per transaction, but the hashrate has tripled since then, so this method would estimate around 75 kWh now

Thats more of an issue with the tax system!
If there was a unilateral agreement that all stocks re-invested profits rather than paying dividends and there was no tacit agreement that shareholders would share in the profits, then I'm guessing a few people would start to question the entire equity market!
A few top performing stocks like Apple and Berkshire Hathaway can get away with this kind of thing because their internal expected rate of return is much better that you'd be able to get elsewhere if they gave you the cash.

when you have a stock - you own a share in the company. For this you get a share of the profits in dividends, or if the profits are re-invested instead of paid out, then you expect this to result in greater profits and dividends down the line. 
When you sell your stocks to someone else, then they will get the share of profits going forwards.

If there are thousands of cryptos available and vendors eventually accept many different ones, then none should be very valuable.
The idea behind a lot of the speculation is the scarcity argument - if there is one widely adopted currency with a limited supply, then people will need to get hold of it to make payments and it become value. If it can be circumvented with 999 alternatives then the value disappears.
@_date: 2018-04-03 06:05:07
