I'm offended.

Haha yea these won't come anywhere near 25 cents an hour. 
24/7 Mining on 1 i5 (university probably doesn't even have that) gives ~$4/month on nicehash LOL

I can almost taste the 0.00001 btc combined per day from all that CPU mining! 
To be honest, that's kind of a dick move. They can use the computer while you mine on it, makes no difference. Mining in your dorm with free electric is one thing, but taking up half the lab where kids are obivously actively studying is a bit much. Try getting a job man, I don't mean to sound like a jerk but nothing beats a steady income!

You must be a special elite user, new ACH accounts are only allowed $2000 limit and cards $100/wk. Unless you wired, in which case you won't have the funds for at least another week.
Why do people lie on the internet, mom?

Personal wallet is also blockchain.info. Still has done nothing at all with a .002 fee paid custom. I'm only worried because blockchain support has never been good in the past. Always extremely sluggish and with a "not-our-problem" attitude.

The WORLD is not anymore the way it used to be, mm mm MM, NO NO NOH

Still waiting on first trans over an hour later.
Is there a way to "rebroadcast" this?

Blockchain -&gt; Blockchain wallet.

What are you even talking about, man? Why do you have to call me an ignorant fuck? That's pretty harsh to say to someone who supports it but is annoyed by it. Not everyone that has a different opinion than you is the Devil, it's going to be ok.
**I OBVIOUSLY use Bitcoins, or else I would not be here.** Calm down there, Melvin. My point is that I paid double the fee and have 0 confirmations after now 2 hours. Could be a blockchain bug and am waiting hours for support to answer me but I see no point in the system if this happens. 
Please explain to me why I should do this again after paying double the normal fee and it's still hanging at 0 confirmations?
Is having a discussion really that hard for you?

Still waiting for FIRST transaction  conf over 1 1/2 hour later.

It seems impossible to have a rational conversation or discussion on this sub. You got downvoted for obvious fanboy reasons, as much as got upvoted for his incoherently stupid comment. I use BTC and they are still rabid at me because I don't believe it's 100% perfect. Holy shit, grow up.

A month ago I used SharedSend, it took me *over 1 week* to successfully receive the coins after several heated emails with support at Blockchain.
I did not want another week of misery/not knowing whether I just tossed a $100 bill away. 
I want BTC to succeed. I really do! I just don't think these things can be so prevalent. Thank you for the advice, cheers mate.

This is just crazy not knowing whether or not I just threw away $100 into the blockchain unconfirmed bug-purgatory. Blockchain support is completely unresponsive as always.
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:18:42
It's just from blockchain wallet to a personal wallet. Extremely unsettling when I up the fee to get confirmations faster and it results in not getting any confirmations whatsoever. 
Would be less frustrating if Blockchain support wasn't so non-existent.
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:49:32
After this long and nothing happening it's blatantly obvious to me I won't be getting my coins until something is done manually.

Paid .002 fee, been over 1 hour, 0 confirmations.
