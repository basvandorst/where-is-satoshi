Being declined sucks.  Embarassing.  I do think it is a place by place basis, I have been using Shift for a while exclusively for every purchase I make and haven't had a single problem.  Just the last 2 days.
I think we are good as of today, though, unless someone gets declined today?  I haven't.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:14:03
This is referencing the Cash App from Square on the app store? I've known square to be legit at least knowing you have a good place to have your money, make payments, been around a while.  I'm gonna try it worry free
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:21:42
It's not
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:30:13
Transactions seem to be going through now...tentatively?  I had a couple that went through today just fine and instantly.  Spoke with another person that had the same experiences.  I think I'm out of the woods now?
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:24:27
Shift Card is working 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:40:55
Cheaper than GDAX how?  GDAX is free. Honestly I am curious because I am looking for a new way to get fiat into the system
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:15:01
You will get sensational headlines about everything you Google, sites are trying to get your traffic. IOTA has real world next level type applications. It's not just a currency or commodity.  Internet of things is fucking everywhere now.  Do a little research I actually think right now is a perfect time to get in to IOTA on the cheap.  I got in at like 3.80 average buy but still believe I'm gonna pull at least 25% profits out if this sucker.
Diversify your bonds, nigga
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:38:53
Shit yeah I cashed out to do some testing and its free if you withdraw fiat from GDAX into bank account.... plus in 2 DAYS! Small about for testing but did a lot.  GDAX/Coinbase rulez for what is out there.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:57:01
25% is tiny? Haha. Wow. Optimistic perspective!  I may be a noob to crypto but not to investing.  Nuts.
  If you spent a quarter the time researching IOTA or crypto at all instead of me maybe you'd be ahead. I never said I had an inside scoop, I even stated I was late to the game.  I just spoke about why I think it's practical.  You and 90% of the people you know uses internet of things technology every day. How would investing in emerging practical technology be a secret? 
Stupid ass triggered lil bitch 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:34:50
Don't they only support 2 cryptos, though?
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:55:24
Thanks for this but is there somewhere you know that gives step by step instructions?  I'm clueless on paper wallets and I want it to be nice
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:40:51
 Thanks everyone! 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:10:36
God there's always one of you around to ruin a perfectly civil discussion isnt there? FOH and just read what's in front of your face.
 Gemini IS NOT free, no one on this page is saying it is.  GDAX is free, that was never up for debate.  Hence the question of why to use Gemini instead. 
Kinda embarrassing for you, sit back down while the adults discuss.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:31:39
Nah I would say may game would prob be just to figure out if binance is regularly lower, if so then buy there! Original thought wasn't very well fleshed out. When I cash out if GDAX is higher it will be there.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:44:23
Omg thank you
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:03:33
 oh I didn't know you could go straight fiat into Gemini! Can you do it for free like GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:50
What shit are you talking now Mr Know It All? Shit some people may have insight and experience you don't?  This just sweeter every time
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:41:34
Yeah Coinbase charges are RIDICULOUS
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:42:20
How long does availability of funds take
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:11:40
Holy shit I really can't stop laughing omg
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:44:46
Great app, I was *just* looking for something like this.  Would be nice to pick refresh rate, exchange and maybe widget support if I could be greedy.  Big up regardless! 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:34:42
Really lends itself to pump and dump. I was having the same thoughts last night
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:31:09
*eats popcorn*
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:00:36
And if you can't spot a joke from Chappelle/Wu Tang....well you just are a waste of space 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:10:22
Right....i have about 25% on exchanges, the rest on Trezor,  which sucks but where the heck am I supposed to put iota?
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:40:53
We weren't discussing transfer fees but you certainly could have interjected that useful info without being so pompous.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:00:11
So you say but about 3 weeks ago that's just what we saw with bcash. The whole market reacted
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:30:31
Good look!
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:11:24
We ain't out yet, homie
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:16:47
Hahaha dang keyboard warrior get some. *you got me* I'm so useless, poor and hopeless. 
MF I was humbly responding to your comment about not knowing what IOTA was by even admitting that I was behind on it atm but giving a couple little nuggets I thought were interesting.  Isn't that what we do on Reddit, we spitball and hypothesize? That's why I'm here, to learn.  That's the point of my post. 
  Who cares how long I've been in crypto?  Was that ever a question?  Did I claim superior knowledge to you? Do I have to pay dues to post here?  Nah man.
You are an asshole and a bully. Just straight aggro attack. I bet the people who know you hate your ass. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:28:08
Every time you make money is a win.  Who cares what could have....a W is a W all day my man.  Big ups 
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:29:07
So.... how was it? Do tell.....
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:04:29
Oh ok this is GREAT news. Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:10:03
Haha thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:29:32
Yeah I mean I'm aware of this but it seems like a gigantic disparity.  If it is what it is, hey cool imma take advantage
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:08:27
I dunno but you can bet I'm gonna test it in small amounts just like I do with all other transactions. Ill play the game.  Really at the end of the day what it comes down to is having $ on both of the exchanges so when the opportunity presents itself I can purchase the same exact amount of coin for a significantly lower price. I suppose ill be watching the difference with a regularity from here on out. 
Just spitballing you know
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:27:50
God damn I took a page out of your book here and looked at your history....holy shit!  Do you ever ask questions or do you just always have the answers? Is everything you write not only a book but edited at that? 
I just want to learn. I'm the first to admit I don't know shit but I do try to be helpful if I can at all. I thought I was responding about an alt I like with enthusiasm. Take it as you will. 
  It seems you are like constantly lashing out. Provoking. Pumping your chest. Hey bro, you're the man. You got me so good!  On to the next one for ya now. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:18:46
I think it's to lessen the monopolization?
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:04:56
I'm def with that.  Diversification in exchanges is important as well. I'm going to sign up tonight
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:30:17
Wow that is terrible.  What bank do you use? From what I know all the majors do
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:37:27
Can you give example of how you did this? I really want to give everyone in my family an amount for Christmas in the easiest possible way
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:10:53
Hahahahaha you sat on that a week? Such a dumbfuck I took small iota profits, moved to xrp, took that come up and bought back into iota at a discount since then.  I might not know a ton about crypto but I know price action.  
Holy shit I can't believe you reposted to this after a week. What a fucking loser. You honestly made my night &lt;3
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:56:24
This 
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:16:22
Yeah that's the last fucking thing I need is a way to watch my crypto by the second.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:27:32
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:41:10
Haha you are joking, right? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:18:43
No absolutely not.  Rule 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:39:58
For real.  Reddit research! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:31:44
Those look like good solutions.  I understand there is a transaction fee for buying and selling coin, but is there any cost for moving your coins back and forth between where you buy them and the hardware wallet of choice? For example buy from Coinbase and then eventually plug in the wallet and move them over
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:15:38
Sweet fucking troll then.  Geeeez
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:28:59
With a bank account yeah.  The price is locked though so you can't sell it.  if you want instant, go card but it will cost you a percentage higher. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:25:16
So hey man you make 3k? Big up! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:16:48
I use a mix of all of them for perspective
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:53:33
Ok so is a wallet an either or thing? Can I only have on mobile and not on pc or vice versa? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:18:57
*HODL ;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:52:14
Yes correct. Neither of us have a stand alone wallet yet
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:37:52
Haha right
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:21:44
Ah yes I did.  While waiting for my bank account to be authorized I just popped 1k from my credit card on there.  Payed the cc off immediately after.  This is great to know thank you so much
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:33:00
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:20:48
Thanks for that I guess I could have just linked the post to make it easier
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:27:11
Do you have a link explaining please
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:14:56
ATH seems to have lost its cause to be pensive. Good times, a tiny bit scary
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:07:04
Fucking do it now, nice lol dip atm if you ask me
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:20:45
That's still worth something though isn't it?  
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:17:22
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:44:36
Please direct me on how to do so.  I'm tired of these fees
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:12:04
Thank you for your answer! 
So you basically set a fee yourself that dictates your priority to be confirmed? Is this only during purchases or does it apply to transfers between other digital currency as well? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:58:43
Yeah man.  Fuck people you can't trust em.  Lots of jerks with brains
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:38:12
And how long does it currently take to transfer
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:21:00
Fuck no
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:21:13
It's terrible.  Laughably. Awesome
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:35:44
Yep. Keep on keepin on
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:19:51
You can deposit into GDAX free with a bank account
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:45:11
You have a take on it? What do you think? I transferred a lil sample of my Bitcoin there
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:07:33
What? This is the least helpful comment ever and doesn't even have proper sentence structure that I can understand.  Of course I want everything to be secure, but personally I feel like a paper wallet is the most risky due to loss and I I'm not invested enough to go hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:51:53
Shouldn't post that here, yo. There's sneaks
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:06:20
 And sharks
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:19:57
Good advice.  It *just* broke, that means we are only entering our upside. Buy now, mf, don't delay. Then hodl that bitch.  Before you know it you'll be posting 10k in your Tesla
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:09:11
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:41:34
Yeah fees are MUCH lower with bank transfers.  Only way to go.  I learned that the hard way
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:56:59
1....million dollars!
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:16:00
I'd say it's a good time to buy.  I'm a little upset I bought last week...i knew I should have waited for a good dip. But fuck it I'm HODL anyways 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:29:01
Is noone looking at Ripple? I just got some of that 
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:31:17
So if I have coins stored on Coinbase, what would you say is the best choice for a wallet at the moment
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:17:08
Why do you care if BCH is having a down day? Fuck the hate train, it's just ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:44:53
I think Coinbase is a great entry level site.  I think it is for beginner purposes awesome.  Obviously as investment grows, your curiosity about security certainly will as well.
Bitcoin went through a big attack recently and everything is wonky atm. Nature of the beast. Post away about Coinbase here, I want to be in the loop without adding another sub to my list
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:58:10
That is how I sent it, with Coinbase.  It wasn't free...it was over 33%. Am I missing something? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:29:05
Do you have a link or something that shows what you do? I'm very interested
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:39:16
Good perspective
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:07:58
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:56:38
Can I ask, if I use GDAX, do I need to have a wallet? That's one of the reasons I chose Coinbase to begin with, is because it comes with a wallet built in.  
If I do need a wallet, can you please suggest a good beginner one? Not paper or hard please. 
I appreciate your help
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:28:05
Buy now. Always buy now.  Gonna be a dip from a higher place later so what's the point in waiting
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:24:07
I just don't get all the flame around it though really. Are the 2 not able to coexist? Asking honestly.  I have not, since I have been in, seen btc as a currency for many reasons.  Too volatile.  I'm hodl all day long on btc  
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:17:30
What can you suggest for a good entry level hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:37:15
That's exactly my move.  Thanks for the info
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:50:34
Ok, now *that's* great.  How do I perform these functions outside of exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:11:04
Bitcoin is quite an anomaly.  Currently there is no better time to buy then now.  All time highs all the damn time. Be ready for a correction soon but it will come back stronger. Look at the history
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:48:25
I appreciate your time in answering!

@_date: 2017-11-29 23:18:18
Holy crap I'd say get a hold of Coinbase customer service.  I hear they are understandably backlogged but they have assisted everyone in an agreeable way. The whole network today was nuts
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:18:40
Umm unless you move it to a wallet afterwards...for free on GDAX btw. The fees are ridiculous right now and often percentage based, so save up more doesn't make too much sense
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:07:47
 Thank you very much
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:37:26
Well from a purely investment view, is that not a good thing?  I kinda thought that was its benefit but please educate me otherwise
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:25:30
what other way is there to get fiat into crypto?  I can't seem to find any other way and would sure appreciate the assist.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:29:34
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:26:20
You really can't but with credit cards any more.  If you can, that ship will sail in the next couple months
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:07:07
Oh my fucking Lord. Never NEVER before have I had an experience with such a deep level of idiocy and pettiness. You are the gift that keeps on giving honestly. Good Lord how long has it been now?  I've made money off iota 3 times now and I'm not even currently in it.  I will be again though. 
You don't have to admit it, but looking at this chain of communication, how insignificant it is and how much mindspace this HAD to take up for you to even remember....you are a human piece of trash. Do something with your life. But mostly thank you for my Thursday smile!
