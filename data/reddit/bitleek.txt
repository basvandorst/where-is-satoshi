I see no mention of GBP (UK) but I see LocalBitcoins which is more of a marketplace than exchange.
If you're in the UK and need BTC for GBP (bank transfer and Pingit, no Paypal / CC):

There is a misunderstanding. BitBargain charges 1% for sellers, everything else depends on them.
For example, a couple of days ago for 2-3 days straight you could buy nice amounts of coins BELOW MT.GOX.
Before the crash, there were days where people sold coins 10-20 GBP above gox and buyers still bought it.
It's all about supply vs demand. Don't judge too quickly.

When you made this post, the OP had already confirmed that there was a refund.
" turns out I did receive a refund but I just didn't see it "
But I mean if you stick to calling it a scam regardless, be my guest.
It'd be a pretty lousy 'scam' to ask people to send money again because there was a refund. Isn't the first thing you do (or anyone does) is to check if you really do have the money?
"Off chances" ? --- I'm sure you've done your homework on these "chances" using the vast amount of data available (for example how many trades the seller has done or simply who the seller was to begin with).
"The right course of action is still to treat him as a scammer" ? --- Yes, that was certainly the right course of action to take here, as proven by the outcome. It wasn't resolved by the OP looking at the statement again to double check facts, it was you treating the legit seller as a scammer, based on your scientifically calculated 'chances'. Thanks for your hard work, I've rewarded you with a thumbs up or whatever they're called on Reddit.
