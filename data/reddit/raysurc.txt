What different type of address formats are being used today? For example, "X addresses start with 1", or "Y ends in 34d" or something. I am trying to understand the different type of address formats that are being used.

Rectangles are the 25-75 percentile, while the line ontop is the top 75-100 percentile, bottom line is the lowest 0-25 percentile? Green means up since previous rectangle, red means a drop? I'm not sure about the line in respect to the green/red bars, I would figure the line would travel in the middle of each rectangle
