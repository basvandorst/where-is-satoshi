Why is THAT your mom's picture??
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:44:09
Yeah, I guess it implies she could nuke his life at any moment?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:15:42
What about short term capital gains? How much would those be?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:59:48
So you don't pay anything if you held for less than a year?
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:21:05
I see, lol. Thanks for informing.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:52:39
I'm new to bitcoin. I don't get it. : (
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:29:24
Oh I see, thanks for informing me. STCG, I'll remember that.
And if you don't sell your BTC, you don't get taxed for it until the year it's sold on?
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:32:11
FUUUUDGE! I was about to invest in Litecoin at this time last year when I was looking at it's price. I didn't fully understand cryptocurrency so I forgot about it.
It would have really helped! Especially if I had put in $300, I would have $6000 now!!!
Hindsight is a real witch!!!
I'm practically down to $500!!!!! That extra 6k would have really helped.

May I suggest they pick a desert such as the western Sahara and utilize solar technology. Solar panels lining the dome of a big dome city that extends underground.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:34:54
Why not just take out half? That way, if it crashes, you still have half, and if it raises, that half will grow. Win-win.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:18:35
I wouldn't mind being dead, mind you. It's like the only guarantee we ever get in life. Totally unavoidable.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin might never go back to two digit numbers ever again, a real guarantee there.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:47:47
I see. : / Too bad I don't own even 1/30th of a bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:53:34
I was thinking about electrum the past two weeks, but today I saw the news it was hacked, so why I got on to ask for the best wallet(to see what else shows up aside from electrum.
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:54:48
Ah, never heard of Exodus, thanks. Electrum I'm kind of frightened about due to the whole hacking thing(I could have sworn I saw news about it weeks ago with it getting hacked or something.)
@_date: 2019-04-30 23:07:15
Yeah, lol, thanks. Whanos is a literal and figurative whale, and uses the Cryptinity Gauntlet for some market manipulation, cutting the market cap in half, and bringing many people underwater, money wise.
@_date: 2019-04-30 23:01:27
Thanks, lol, not only can I do photo manipulation, but video editing as well, I'm thinking of making a parody trailer of the Avengers: IW called "Anongers: Infinity Dump" as per the title of this poster, with various meme's as different super heroes, then follow up with the sequel that will parody Endgame, and be about getting the next bull run to start or something. : P
The main villain being Whanos, a literal and figurative whale and market manipulator, has in his possession the Cryptinity Gauntlet. By collecting all Cryptinity Tokens(Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Cardano, and Tether), he will be able to live up to his name of manipulating the market, allowing him to cut the market cap in half, and causing the next bear market, unless, the Anongers stop him(just like in the movie they are parodying, they fail, lol).
@_date: 2019-04-30 23:20:49
What about Wasabi?
And do you know about using QR codes for receiving bitcoin payments?
@_date: 2019-04-30 23:49:35
Thanks, what did you think of my decision for each infinity stone to crypto? Ether = Aether(lol).
@_date: 2019-04-30 22:06:58
I see, thanks for the info, and is there any reason to not use Bitcoin core over Electrum?
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:25:49
I see. Yeah, that's quite a major loss.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:20:19
I see, so ASICs are specialists with the sole purpose of mining. Would making an ASIC the size of a truck or even the size of a 10 story building increase it's hashpower since the parts involved are larger?
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:15:06
Does [this answer your question??](
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:44:02
The day is upon us.
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:49:37
Sorry, I thought your original statement implied you hated tron.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:04:40
Perhaps it was top-secret, mining tech? Or the Hadron Collider has been converted into the world's biggest ASIC miner?
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:02:11
Is it possible that the Hadron Collider mined those blocks?
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:50:11
Yeah, I figured it might be an error, but at the moment I saw it, I thought it was a major crash of some sort.
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:08:38
That was hilarious when the snake at 1:26 fell into the pit the lizard jumped over, lol.
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:02:32
Unfortunate, I guess they can't be retired to play retro games(ps2-ps3 era in the future is retro) now.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:35:24
I don't know about associating bitcoin with such a fiat-based car, they really should have gone with this vehicle, which just like bitcoin, is standing up to the pre-existing, monopolistic, out-dated institutions such as banking and fossil fuels.  
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:14:03
How interesting. So they will just switch to building blocks after. And I do remember paying a $20 fee in December at some point and thought it was just the exchange rather than BTC itself.
I guess the blockchain also serves as a conduit for transparency. So you can prove who and what owns some Bitcoins. Thanks again for the explanation.
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:25:07
Yeah, give bitcoin's antagonists ideas why don't ya.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:29:15
Very neat, never knew that was what ASIC meant. Can an ASIC ever be converted into a general purpose chip by replacing it's program? Or is what makes an ASIC an ASIC more on the physical level, with the chip being permanently bound to it's purpose because of the hardware?
@_date: 2018-03-04 14:42:36
Doesn't get any deader than -100%.
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:58:47
I see, although I meant would a quantum computer be able to sustain high level graphics far beyond anything we have without any hiccups in performance? Would levels be the size of actual earth, in that you can travel from one side of the world to the other without the world being divided into levels, so that when you go from one segment to another, you don't get "NOW LOADING".
I am super curious what magnitude are quantum computers able to achieve in those aspects of gaming.
@_date: 2018-03-04 14:45:56
I wasn't in Tron or anything, I just logged in on Bittrex and saw Tron at -100% and decided to save a picture.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:00:16
I see, thanks for the explanation. By the way, what purpose does SHA-256 hashing or any hashing serve? I heard something like Universities and Science facilities use this hashing power from all over the globe.
But what exactly is it for? Like what is it really specifically doing? Like if hashing didn't exist, would they just be hashing stuff on their own PCs, but now that this global network exists, they put up a queue of "problems" to solve for hashers all over? Do these mathematical problems ever run out?
IT's probably the only thing bugging me about this whole thing, lol. I'm genuinely curious.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:52:49
They must be using the Hadron Collider to mine bitcoin instead of opening portals to dimensions full of doomsday critters and such.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:54:24
I always here about quantum computers in the crypto space, but how do they effect other stuff, like games? What would "quantum" based games look and play like?
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:06:17
I see, thanks for the detailed explanation, I actually understood that. So basically, mining is simply for the sake of being an incentive to acquire new bitcoins and nothing else?
I was lied to!
EDIT: And what happens when the final bitcoin is mined? All those mining facilities will become useless and be abandoned if they can't be sold(unless they are used to mine other coins in the future.)
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:58:42
I see, I guess a fair trade off then for absolute specialization.
What year will it be when theres piles of ASIC miners the size of mountains laying around at garbage dumps? 2150?
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:57:29
Must be Alien Antminers with future tech.
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:59:20
LOL, "Rekt-men: Days of Futures, When?" is such a perfect title. X D Makes me want to make a poster about it if you wouldn't mind.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:16:24
THIS was the meme for the start of it. D:
I got a vegeta meme: 
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:35:20
Thanks, hopefully I'll get around to it if I manage to make the END REKT/PUMP GAME posters.
@_date: 2019-05-01 01:18:49
Oooh, okay, so I would basically need 200+ GB of space to run the bitcoin core program?
I see now why Electrum and others like Wasabi are useful.
@_date: 2019-05-01 01:23:46
True, especially a bitcoin/avengers meme. D:
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:34:39
Nice. X D So much potential in those titles.

"Dread it, run from it, the bears still arrive." - Whanos
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:03:50
That's the sequel to Infinity Dump, lol.
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:27:18
You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on and grow. Some do. But not us.
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:18:29
Is that your Captain Marvel analog? I haven't done the individual movies yet, was hoping to use some popular memes to fill each, like for Black Panther =[Wakandan Knuckles]( (from Ugandan Knuckles meme, lol).
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:23:14
Ass4brunch… you have my respect. I hope the people of r/altcoin will remember you.
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:19:37
Well, if I ever get a surplus that allows 200 GB stuff to be installed, I'll consider it.
Yeah Electrum is working out, some good samaritan sent me satoshis last night on it through the QR code I left in a meme poster I made through photo manipulation: 
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:47:05
X D
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:12:21
Awhalers makes sense, lol, I used Anongers since the meme culture is appropiated by Anons, and was gonna use meme heroes such as Pepe-Hulk, Captain Wojak, and Wakandan Knuckles, lol.
Looks like somebody already thought of Hulk Pepe:
[Mean and Green](
I'm just trying to figure out some of the others, like what meme character would take Iron Man's place?
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:14:50
Sometimes, the hardest choices require the strongest wills. So probably.
@_date: 2019-05-01 01:17:49
That's the endgame.
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:35:50
Here's a version with a QR code and the Bitcoin visible on the gauntlet, anybody want to send a few satoshis of appreciation? D:
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:06:16
Lol, I almost called him Whalenos, but it just doesn't roll of the tongue as well as Whanos.
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:47:35
I've had it for 8 years now. D:
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:58:35
True, sometimes memes reflect the times and people might think things are going down to goblin town.
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:04:17
@_date: 2019-05-01 01:20:41
Since it's used to manipulate the market apparently. D: As well as the fact that people take refuge in it when they feel a dump is incoming.
@_date: 2019-05-04 02:08:54
I see, lol, that reminds me of all the funny and clever memes that came out during the 2017 bullrun.
@_date: 2019-05-04 02:07:28
I am... HODL-man.
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:03:15
Lol, nice use of all those references.
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:57:40
Thanks, lol, if you liked that, then you'll definitely like my previous Whanos post:  [
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:05:35
I'm trying both out now.
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:51:42
Oh okay, klol.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:21:04
This is actually the pre-prequel, lol. The first movie in fact, lol. It's the story of the 2017 bullrun, the first Anongers gathering. Before the Age of Beartron in 2018, followed by Infinity Dump, then the final movie, End Rekt, which pits them against Whanos, and in the end, Whanos gets Rekt.
@_date: 2019-05-01 01:22:50
Thanks, I have a slightly different version with the bitcoin in the gauntlet visible, and a QR code thingy so I can receive bitcoin payments. D: 
Do you know where I can ask people to send a few satoshis to the QR code address so I can see if it works. D: I'd do it myself but I'm phoneless until May 3rd.
