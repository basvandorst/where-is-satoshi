I bought bitcoins around 5k and 6k price. Saw the price boom until almost 19k.. I didn't sell.
I agree with you... bull is over. I think the price will slowly go down to 5k -6k... and will stay there for a while. Maybe even 2k! and stay there for a year or two...
It will then slowly rise up again once more companies accepting it... and more user-friendly apps/wallet reaches to mainstream user, not to mention widespread adoption of Lightning Network.
This is actually a good thing, the recent Bitcoin buyers are there just for the speculation (including me). But I am strapped to this rocket for the long term... this is going to be a long and probably slow and very boring ride to the moon.

Thoughtful answer... to a nonsense question... 
People tries very complicated trick to safeguard their coins, I think it is more likely they might get themselves locked out of the wallet (forget their password) instead of those coins get stolen...
Don't over complicate things..., 24 seeds words + 1 password that ONLY you know is more than enough.

I do not understand. Please ELI5 me.
You bought bitcoin in 2013... and have been hodling like a yoda ever since.
Then you sold all BTC for BCH... WHY? BCH was forked in August, which means you already have an equal amount of BCH in your wallet.
Why the hell you think it is prudent to sell all BTC and buy BCH, common sense would say just hodl both BTC and BCH... you cannot lose.

Why did you wait? What will the price you think bitcoin could be someday? 10k? 100k? 1M?
If you do believe it will reach that price sooner or later, why does it matter if you buy NOW at ATH?  It is irrelevant doesn't it?
If you hesitate, that means you do not really believe bitcoin could reach that price. If you do not believe, then why buy? Put that money in some safe Unit Trust Fund.

If you value you friendship... don't.
If your friend caved in and put their hard earned money into this, and few years down the road bitcoin turned out to be trash and has no value whatsoever... you friend will put this on you.
That is the easiest way to turn friend into enemy.
I do occasionally bring bitcoin into conversation with my friends... and watch their interest/reaction... and that's it. I never attempt to persuade them into buying it.
If they are interested they will come back to me to ask more about it... but so far... none did.

Right? I made a similar mistake once, though not that drastic. I put a limit order (or so I thought)  to buy when the price reaches 7k. 
But the app I was using do not support limit order so it became market order instead. The order was executed at 7.2k.
So I am confused how did he managed to sell that low? Unless there is no order on book?? Which sounds even more ridiculous...

You need to accumulate enough bitcoins so that it is large enough to transfer out I guess. 
Read the terms and conditions of the site,  I am sure it is explained somewhere there. 
If you are lucky enough to win enough bitcoins, I bet there will be 'transfer fee'  imposed when you are ready to transfer out...  hahaha.. 
Most likely the site is just a scam to collect bitcoins from unsuspecting gamblers... best of luck!

I dont have that much BTC, yet I never use online wallet, I never use a PC to access (let alone generate) wallet.
I use my android phone for that, using the phone's data connection (instead of home wifi).
And even then, my wallet is multi-signature... shared with my wife's phone (which is iOS), and both have 2FA enabled.
Even THEN, I already ordered a hardware wallet... which should arrive in a month...
You see?... call me paranoid... but I would rather be paranoid than having my bitcoin stolen.

Don't feel so bad... one way to look at it is consider this as a lesson... you have gained so much practical knowledge about how the market works (stock/bitcoin/whatever) than anyone could possibly learn from reading books.
I was young once, and I traded forex... and I failed miserably.... but (I didnt know it then), I gained something... I understand how market works and what make it move the way it does...
If there is anything I can say, forget about all the charts indicators! (bollinger bands, fibbonaci resistance.., whatever yaddaa yadaa..).
All the information you need is right there before your eyes... wide open... 
Now I am a much wiser trader..., slightly older yes.. but much more profitable... and happier... and lots of free time too....

Bitcoin payment is not practical yet IMHO... how long they have to wait for the transaction to be confirmed? 30 minutes?... credit cards (including time to swipe etc) take less than 30 seconds...

I think the OP just want to make sure he is not making mistake by buying at ATH only to see it dips 1k or 2k the next week.
The thing is nobody knows what will happen, it could go both ways... the price could shoot 1k or 2k next week as well...
So I say just go all in with all the money you could afford to lose... and enjoy life... whatever happens next, happens... no point wasting precious brain energy thinking we could analyze it.

Probably a newbie... for example in Luno you could just press 'Buy Bitcoin' and you are all set... Luno will get the lowest price it can find on the market and buy it for you... it happened to me... twice!... I bought bitcoin at USD5.4K when the price currently was 4.9K!... a $500 premium...
Then again I bought at 5.8K when the actual price was 5.6K!
I only realised what was happening when I spent more time understanding the bid and ask work... then I learnt stop order.. limit order.. etc..
But I have no complain... you live and learn... besides... I am already in the black!...

Bitcoin is still in its infancy... the marketcap is only 136B right now... that is why the value is going up and up...
In comparison, gold marketcap is in the TRILLION! (100T according to this: 
Once Bitcoin reaches that stage... the price will more or less stagnant... just like gold nowadays... Bitcoin will be considered 'low yield, safe investment'.. just like gold today.
If Bitcoin ever reaches that stage... it will become a stable currency... 10,20,50, of even 100 Billion of bitcoin values could be traded with little effect to its price.
Who knows? Maybe at that time 1 bitcoin is equal to 25kg of gold (1M USD at current price) -

Is it? There are 100,000,000 Satoshi in 1 BTC... That means if 1 BTC ever reach 1 million USD, 1 satoshi would be 100 USD.
So if you are buying a $10 pizza, you would pay 0.1 satoshi..
I think the unit is fine...

Please inform us in advance when you are buying again...

Yes, I am aware that I am not 'investing' in bitcoins right now... I am 'gambling' and 'speculating'.... if that is what you are trying to say.
I can afford to lose all my money in BTC... since this is just a gamble, I might as well gamble to the moon.... or lose everything in the process... I don't care.

I am using Luno. Their fee is minimal and service is fast. 
Coinhako also accepts Malaysia deposit.

Lol... I honestly didn't know Mel Gibson buying Bitcoin...
Also the subtitle is misspelled...

You can get the data back but it will cost you more than $450 worth of crypto. That's for certain.

Does not say Bitcoin, could be any coins...

I am NOT sorry for your lost. That much Bitcoin and you are too cheap to buy a hardware wallet? 
Are you that stupid, that cheap, or both? You only got yourself to blame 
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:21:03
At USD 6K, that 20 BTC would be 120K, do you honestly believe the thief is that Nobel?
I am really sorry for your lost, I do.. , but the faster you get over it and work hard to accumulate more btc the better. 
I will try to help you by upvoting this.

You could also add, once this goes mainstream (and it will), money transfer will be almost instant... to anywhere in the world... and very-very cheap!... the money is borderless... just like the internet is..., and 'bankless'.

What about BitPay? I have 1.24 btc in their wallet, should I get worried?
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:35:30
You better be buying BTC now... before it reaches 1 million... by then you would be kicking yourself...
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:44:51
I am using BitPay for Android (pro tip: don't ever use desktop wallet, there are too many horror stories).
Why I am comfortable using BitPay is because:
1) The private keys are generated in my phone, and BitPay does not have them.
2) MOST IMPORTANTLY, I can create multi-sign wallet... where there are more than one private keys... now both me and my wife need to authorize the transaction for it to go through... the more co-payers the better, make it 3 co-payers if you could.

Why didn't you use PayPal or credit cards? Expensive purchase?

So ObamaCare stills intact in 2025?
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:55:01
That is where multi-signature comes in place... (google bitpay multi signature wallet) my wife also needs to approve the transaction. You could even setup 3 or 4 co-payors if you are really paranoid...
I dont work for BitPay, but I honestly believe their wallet is a very good trade-off between security and ease of use...
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:00:37
You are right... 1 Satoshi is no longer divisible...
Well, let's hope I am still alive and still hodling my bitcoins when the fork happens... 
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:28:59
Ok thanks... I am still waiting for my hardware wallet though... will switch as soon as possible.
