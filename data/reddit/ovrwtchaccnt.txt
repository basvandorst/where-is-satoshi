Hi TRS,
Right now a good fee is around $15 or under at 0.001BTC, that's within 30 blocks around 5 hours I think. What do you want to do? pay the fee separate not from your sent amount?

Lightning is a scaling solution. The lightning network acts as a side-chain to the main bitcoin network(the mempool where all the transactions go to wait and be confirmed by miners) or a layer on top of the main network that is independent of the main chain.

If you are moving bitcoin from coinbase to a wallet there is a fee attached, if you move from gdax to another walelt there is no fee because GDax pays.

le tiny hands 2 scoops **DRUMPF** amiright?
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:35:35
it's simple math multiplication, for each kb of the transaction, on average 226kb you will multiply by that amount of satoshis. That's why your fees go up to like $40.  And that's why I recommend 0.001 (0.00100000x226 for example), the fee will never be in FIAT, you are working with bitcoin, not USD or any countries monopoly money. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:36:51
The best fee right now is around .00117520 satoshis, about $15, that's on the cheap side.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:28:04
Noob here, what makes a TX too big for LN? Or, how big is too big?
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:06:16
Still much cheaper for merchants, can transact any day and any hour. Nobody can shut down your wallet unlike paypal or a bank de-platforming you so yeah ill take that fee any day

Yes, but coinbase itself is a retail front and to buy from there they will charge you a fee on top of the bitcoin price. I.E. a retail markup.
GDAX is the traders front where people ask and bid for bitcoin.

One only receives an equal amount of BCH as BTC at the time of the fork. This is also per-wallet so if you had your 3bitcoin in 2-3 different addresses you have to individually dump keys or restore from seed in a BCH compatible wallet.

If what you claim is true OP, and I already saved your thread, it's possible to not have to shut anything off just redirect or merely tell a miner to not mine for periods of time. To my knowledge antbleed was never fixed.

The miners get it, every 10 minutes on average a new block is minted, this block contains a few things, a list of every transaction included, the bitcoin reward PLUS the transaction fees included in the block, the reward is split along the pool miners who minted the block so to speak

Miners acting in bad faith will send themselves many transactions of very few BTC, but with larger than average transaction fees pushign themselves to the front of the queue and everyone else back, by continuing this action they cut to the front or middle of the queue and   get confirmations on their own TX clogging up the line with their useless TX.
Dont let anyone tell you this is a legitimate use of the mempool resource, it's not, it's acting in bad faith.

Then please explain to me, since you are so learned in these matters,  how the money supply as it enters the economy through the federal reserve and how it has operated since the 1910's is not enslaving the government and the public with trillions in unpayable debt.
How is it good that every ONE US Dollar that enters the economy must be paid back WITH INTEREST since it's printed. How is it good that it is literally impossible to pay back what is owed to the US federal reserve.

i can buy bitcoin just fine from coinbase without getting my account closed :-)
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:44:58
No, my bitcoin is a fraction more valuable thanks to them
@_date: 2018-05-08 16:33:43
They all like the idea of a crypto, just not bitcoin because they either cant control it now like the people who got in early(as in years ago) or dont own a controlling stake. They all hate bitcoin and will find any excuse to say they dont like it.
also wildcard, hes jewish. :-)

The current way the economy works thanks to keynesian money-magic(fill an empty cave with bottles full of "hundos" and fill the cave up) it's just not conductive to savings when it's all about credit and spending.

I can still buy Bitcoin from coinbase and I didn't get my money frozen like a dumbass.
@_date: 2018-05-06 07:10:20
Because "btc dominance" is measured by pitting BTC against every other coin which is an asinine comparison.

"Hey guys wouldn't it be nice if bitcoin crashed in value and we could have lots more people adopting the medium?"
Don't get me wrong, greater adoption would be great but, organically, let people come to bitcoin don't force it on them because 'hey its cheap so get in now', it only brings in people looking to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:44:30
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:49:21
And the idea is still amassing power in the hands of "democratic committees" and that's been sooo gooood for communist countries.

Well, the government has the incentive to shut it down, if what another user said is true, that they need not pay taxes so long as theyre not using the kroner well see how it ends.
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:40:48
The system would shut it down before people even tried.

I don't follow, my math doesnt add up .8 +.125 into 1 where does the extra 0.075 come in?
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:03:36
1/6th of total value in 3 days is quite a dip. A dip isnt meant to be a crash.

Bitcoin today touched the high 890's and it's on it's way to 930 ish as of right now. I really doubt it will get lower than that(760). Or to even reach the low 600's

Link the transaction already
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:29:20
Compare the price when you bought to today, are you ahead? At worst expect 760.
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:08:56
Good man, but I disagree on the part that bitcoin was designed to be cheap, I think you meant divisible up to 8 decimal units, ha. I just have 1 question, where do you trade for other alts?
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:20:53
except when the victim is dead, how do you protect those rights?

oh crap seriously? how do we compete with that?
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:13:33
dude im just screwing with you. i own bitcoins too.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:22:52
What fact? That the value has gone down? Yeah thats a fact, but what exactly is the fact that bitcoin is losing dominance over?

Haha WOW

@_date: 2017-03-22 19:28:24
You cant compete with the chinese and mine bitcoin unless you got 6 figures to invest in hardware and then just as much for electricity
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:29:01
It is a possibility.

Are you willing to go into more detail? I came back to bitcoin so to speak a few days ago and i feel like i have a lot of catching up to do.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:29:56
How would you work out people getting their coins in volatile markets? Do they get the coins at the price they bought or when they turn in their receipt? Its too high an investment and risk for rewsard.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:28:16
oh I doubt norway will shut down bitcoin. I meant the city, yeah, they could try getting people for tax evasion.
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:11:53
Yep, I am of the mind that everything has a backdoor. All governments are in on it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:52:07
you dont have to, you can ditch bitcoin. i don't see it happening though. can you buy drugs with any other alt coin? I would seriously like to know.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:29:00
I dont want BU anything near my buttcoins
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:10:01
To be honest I agree.

@_date: 2017-03-25 00:54:25
If you want to sell fast, take coins from coinbase to GDAX
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:53:30
I doubt new miners unless they live in a town with a nuclear plant in europe or the USA will be setting up mining ops. As of right now I mean.

I am of the same mind.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:27:54
Dont worry there wont be a fork.
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:57:16
Im seeing a lot of 0.001BTC sales on GDAX trying to push the price down. is that what you mean?
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:49:44

From the state, or god, or the mob. Take your pick :DDDDd
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:57:17
You will have your coins back. It might take time. The confirmations of the transaction will let you know it's invalid and the coins will bounce back. That's how it should work. Be mroe careful next time.
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:25:45
Communism has never been about decentralization... It has always accumulated power in the hands of the state, only an idiot would believe that communists would ever give  way to the power structures and allow the state to "wither away".
You gotta be a child to believe that ever happening. In fact Bakunin told us exactly what marx's communism would accomplish in russia, that the banks would win and lo and behold the bolsheviks rose to power and marx's family the rothschilds sucked that country dry for 80 years.

Btc can only go down for the time being depending on what happens to the stolen coins from hong kong. But in the long term it will recover. thats my opinion.
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:18:20
If you have a debit or credit card you can also get them instantly through coinbase. Have you tried localbitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:39:21
BU has all of those though
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:21:44
man ive been reading the complete opposite on some of the posts here in the last 3 days lol
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:57:48
there's not going to be a fork have you paid attention these last 2 weeks?

@_date: 2017-03-19 15:34:41


Oh wow
@_date: 2017-03-31 00:28:07
But with enough coins why keep or try to keep it lower? To buy more?
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:44:17
Maybe someone wants the cash
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:15:38
ask your mom, i was there.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:22:48
If you sell to coinbase you sell directly to them, not the market. You can try your luck at the market if you want on GDAX or sell to localbitcoins person to person. Or another exchange.
Your choice. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:02:49
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:17:42
I only looked at USD,s orry
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:34:25
Will coinbase do this?
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:39:42
youre kidding, right?
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:27:53
I missed out, I saw it go to 996, but it went back up to 1k+ haven't seen it go as low again 
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:02:32
They had to accept cash because they couldn't use bitcoin, ironic isnt it?
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:03:08
If they are in electrum, and if you have your SEED you can recover them with the code words and restore your wallet.

end of summer? how do you figure?
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:38:53


Almost 2 actually and thanks for your post.
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:26:11
Unlike you I don't make excuses for, nor defend pedophiles. If thats the hill you want to die on well thats on you.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:17:21
Yes, the early adopters and people who bought into them, so what?
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:21:09
its been 10 hours how'd it go?
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:05:56
really makes me think
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:08:47
What are you hedging against?
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:04:31
You want to watch for the dips, volatility has been high these last few days, from 1100 to low 900's, standing average prices about 960, USD of course. 
Your choice, but later usually implies a higher price. keeping volatility in mind.

While I can read spanish I can't attest the same for most others here. Having said that I read the article and I would not be surprised to see interest for bitcoins in south america, like in peru now, venezuela like another article in that site point to, colombia, ecuador, argentina and chile.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:50:30
I only see a square
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:57:43
How so?
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:49:48
how does one even get btus?
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:04:58
Yes but not the dirt floor poor of africa and asia or south america, who is providing them access to a bitcoin market?
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:24:39
P.S. Social studies are for leftoids and communists.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:17:08
Yes but there is also no real reason for it to not do a steady climb. Big sells have happened under market price to artificially drive the price down when there are a steady supply of buyers.
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:30:44
Why should pedophiles have rights?
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:05:33
Has it been 5-7 work days?
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:04:14
Link anyone?
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:13:23
**No we do not.** Laws and rights are being used or turned into tools to protect criminals from evidence whilst the rights of the victims are for nothing now!
Murderers, rapists and consumers of child pornography are having their rights protected more than those of their victims!
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:25:53


Doesn't this defeat the purpose and will get me less than what I pay into them? This looks like the equivalent of buying a shovel in a gold rush.
@_date: 2017-03-26 04:42:19
the old ones run on 70's and 80's technology thats why we dont have thorium plants.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:52:14
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:05:33
i would ask them but no response
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:39:16
yeah but I had never seen a 180BTC buy order like this
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:55:21
OWO What's this?
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:53:17
Who? Which?
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:31:23
hey kid here you go 
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:51:28
It means there will be 2 chains instead of one, think of your coins as cloned and existing on both chains. Us users will then decide what to do.
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:02:21
Where are your bitcoin? In the electrum wallet?
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:42:52
because hes an honest idiot or he benefits from all that sweet sweet centralization of market forces.
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:26:53
Ill take your BTC if you don't want it :) 
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:34:24
1 million USD per coin
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:33:51
The man is not in jail for refusing to reveal passwords, that is not what is being asked of him.
 **He had refused to comply with a court order commanding him to unlock two hard drives the authorities say contain child porn.**
He is being held in contempt for not using the passwords *himself*
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:54:43
Well know if we get there before we die or before the system itself collapses. in the future
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:48:27
that comma surprised me hahaha
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:28:01


get them out of there and into a wallet you control.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:39:01
Communism is the aids of the mind
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:25:44
I wish it was gold.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:16:07
@_date: 2017-03-30 04:15:17
i hope you get sorted out
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:41:18
And this is the hill you choose to die on? Defending the rights of consumers of child pornography? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:31:42
So the chinese have gone from exchanges to inter-person trades?
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:08:36
Oh I see, I understand how that works.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:35:35
Send me bitcoins and ill double them.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:05:41


This is true for majority if not all newspaper sources nowadays. Objective and Investigative Journalism are dead.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:45:42
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:47:48
You understood him enough to know where he made his grammatical errors and at the same time understood his message, so what's the problem? :DDD
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:20:11
Give my mom a break everybody
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:04:15
He took a picture with and is wearing the tshirt. I dont know what else to take from that
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:40:04
Hahaha that butterfly fart was worth almost 70 million USD.
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:31:40
dude... youre better off just going into coinbase set up an account and get them there.
@_date: 2017-03-31 00:30:31
Im not objectively wrong though, investigative journalism is dead.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:40:23
"the markets will punish the community", I thought they where one and the same?
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:43:03
He was on a monitored network.
@_date: 2017-03-23 04:51:58
I dont think it is.
@_date: 2017-03-23 05:29:06
i dont get it
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:49:10
fug :DDDD
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:24:17
I dont see it happening
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:41:31
What if the government confiscated the nodes? :)
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:49:37
Its 120 gigs total fo rnow I think
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:17:07
That already happened, his sister testified in court, the network he was on was monitored.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:00:35
Im hoping for it too.
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:02:05
But that would imply the winnings of the OP came from many tiny transactions?
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:56:21
Casn I do this at home with my own PC? How much will it take from my HDD?
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:11:24
Forks not going to happen./
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:10:19
Which exchanges are you referring to? Don't be vague now.
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:54:58
But thats what Ive done int he past and ive never had that issue.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:29:15
You could try asking the Devs, I saw some sites but they seemed dodgy.
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:22:05
He's trying to pretend that the USA was not founded as a country of whites exclusively for whites(mostly white english) who made laws like this 
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:55:10
that's cool.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:33:37
Well I think you're almost going to get it since it's gone down to 1090 from 1200
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:14:42
It's 1162!
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:33:04
i thought it was last week D:
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:12:36
I hope so!
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:10:29
You should throw that idea to John McCaffee he was setting up a pool too right? He should know he needs big rigs and power to do it.
Electricity is not cheap where I live but I would get an asic just to help out Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 01:55:34
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:47:33
Ha! So I have but I never traded on bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:57:17
Well it had 1 million bitcoins in it.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:03:06
Well the service is free but, not to the investors of the IPO and the stock brokers and shorters and other investors.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:39:03
Its gone down 9-12 % in the last 2 days, do you want a 25% dip?
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:37:06
I find myself constantly hating this guy or maybe him and his opinion, more every day.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:07:54
I thought the whole ETF thing was stupid im glad that failed.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:45:42
Bitcointalk or?
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:32:31
then maybe hes not as bad as I thought he was.
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:44:21
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:07:33
The money is also an ach transfer so it takes 5 days.
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:01:55
Thats bullshit but I believe it
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:48:39
OMG BITCOIN UNLIMITED HAS 2.5% THE HARD FORK IS IMMINENT
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:09:12
Be friendly or else.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:11:50
Well the fork hasnt actually happened has it? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:16:11
I understand your slippery slope fallacy and where you're going with it, but I don't care. i really do nto give a shit about a cop with CP in his hard drives.
Maybe he fucking should decrypt his HDD he's in jail and has been for 18 months, he has a fucking lawyer to defend him, he knows exactly why hes sitting his ass in jail and is waiting for any excuse that springs him out scott free.
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:13:18
Satoshi is the Bitcoin King
@_date: 2017-03-23 00:04:30
So I shouldnt ask them to look into it, got it.

The coinbase retail is iffy
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:20:46
ill buy your coins.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:43:06
Oh yeah definitely. those 2? yep.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:45:42
You have 11 hours to practice patience. I made 2 tx and both times paid the max $1 fee.

How do you run a smaller node? I was told there where commands I could use when running the wallet program.
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:16:31
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:09:40
With your wallet program
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:02:44
Programmable in what way? Bitcoin is a good way to cut out middle-men with much much smaller transaction fees than banks and money transfer services in much less time. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:13:39
I understand.
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:15:35
Not really since they only counted as 3/5ths of a person. And only Free white men of good standing could be naturalized as citizens since the 1790's. :)
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:28:10
What does your wallet show?
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:41:00
Whaaat? Where?
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:45:03
Bitcoins denomination is Bitcoin,**B**, we just assign a fiat value to better understand where we are.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:24:46
Just put them in your own wallet, dude.
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:14:50
Damn. I wish I had that kind of money! :O
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:50:01
Which is why when I go to google and type in "china smog", all those articles must be related to clean hydro power?
Edit: 51 coal operational vs 44 Hydro operational
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:09:30
0.14? you should send a bug report
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:39:14
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:56:41
Because new coins still have good value when mined
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:00:50
Are you a buttcoin millionaire? I would hold or sell half a coin at a time, unless you want to grash dis blane wid no surbibors? In that case, sell it all and say"here's a big order"... "for u"

@_date: 2017-03-24 15:47:43
Starting an exchange with all the laws and regulations he needs to follow because of all the money hes going to handle through bank accounts and deposits. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:14:28
I guess that confirms it then.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:05:11
Who are these very poor using bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:05:57
Hmm. Well, perhaps a whale is unloading.
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:23:09
No, we don't. As a collective we can choose who we allow to benefit from rights which our societies provide, there is a reason people land in jail. His victims, the kids used to produce the pornography he has in his drives are human beings too, what of their rights? 
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:17:12
Is that place the only one?
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:21:57
It's not half way to the moon  :'(
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:22:26
Not the same thing posting personal info on a public forum vs legal scrutiny by the government for a legal case. Then again you think the american government is this totalitarian absolute monster.
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:48:00
I agree, even I use mainly my debit card nowadays and dont carry cash on me. I keep some cash at home, the rest in the bank, not for safe keeping but for the debit card.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:01:19
 it cant be estimated
 there wont be a fork.
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:11:45
I guess but you need minimum a phone and internet access
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:01:28
Hinting that the PBOC is behind BU is a bit of conjecture. I don't think that's what he's implying. More a thought exercise.
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:22:25
bro, 65 million was stolen from hong kong bitfinex, give it time and youll see.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:33:05
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:02:15
There s no need at all for a hard fork. We arent against bigger blocks either, thats what segwit and 2mb blocks are planned for. Also can you tell me what "emergent consensus" means? because if it means 3-5% of nodes then thats not really emergent taking note how long BU has been out there.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:33:32
I could if I wanted to but. That was it for me. Now I just hold on to that 1 btc to see what happens. Though I might buy a piece or two during dips like I did about a day ago when it went down to 950
@_date: 2017-03-28 06:02:05
And thus BU itself is an attack on  Bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:07:00
**EVERYONE PANIC**
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:18:23
You mean like localBTC? I think it already did.
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:47:19
Why? Has your bank called you? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:19:49
Your country on communism pretty much. Or absolute market controls.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:00:18

@_date: 2017-03-17 01:21:49
Can you buy drugs with ethereum?
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:57:47
this is my aim. to hold just 1 bitcoin and see what happens, hell maybe even 2 one day.
@_date: 2017-03-30 08:27:07
Buy now right?
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:54:50
So the machines are connected to the internet and the buy the BTC in real time at market value?
How many will you have? Where will you put them? Theyre going to end up around the places where there already is BTC adoption and it's small dude.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:40:59
Many factors. A bitcoin theft the sum of 62 million + in hong kong, the FUD going around between the bitcoin and BitcoinUnlimited fork.
Or maybe GENERAL PANIC
@_date: 2017-03-31 02:47:35
Ohio! :DDD
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:56:39
How so?
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:14:30
MAXIMUM OVER PUMP
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:57:29
Also not fair I was waiting for it to officially be under 1k to post it.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:40:35
The market is not something necessarily logical, thats what marketing is all about.
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:38:41
He doesnt have to give the government the passwords, just unlock them himself.
@_date: 2017-03-23 05:37:03
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:28:19
yes, yes, alts are being pumped like never before and whilst Bitcoin alone accounts for 70% of the market share, all the other alts put together make up for 30% of the market share.
Watch out bitcoin here come all the other pumped coins!
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:14:06
For me absolutely this.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:44:22
In any case I simply dont see BU coming out on top.
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:33:43
So your plan is to wait on a dip and sell? That means you already have bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:01:58
You bought retail dude. If you need them in the now try an open market. They take 7-10 days because you probably bought friday. It takes 5 full business days or more depending on your bank from when the transaction starts. 
Not counting the weekends. This is why ACH transfers are such a bitch. Which is what you did.
And I say this as a coinbase customer of over 4 years.
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:32:50
BitFinex was HAGGED, did you take that into account?
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:20:56
Come on chinese peoples, rebel agains de gommunisds, blease ;__;
@_date: 2017-03-23 05:19:01
There's not going to be a fork
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:59:31
This is not the place to be making such a question,. honestly. Rethink your business plan
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:24:28
how do you know?
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:12:57
yeah the emerging consensus coming from no more than 4% of total nodes?
@_date: 2017-03-31 00:29:57
fug u :DDDDdd
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:40:13
Yeah fuck edison.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:53:08
So BTCU has no actual developers? At least none in the same class as BTC core I assume?
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:56:24
Maybe, how much is it though? This is why I never trust anyone selling me shovels. Give me an upfront price and tell me what other hardware ill need to run it properly.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:40:27
Oh wow I would need a new HDD! Mine is only 500 gb and almsot full
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:52:24
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:50:27
I dont, thats just what I thought about the break in from what I read in the articles. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:58:45
I lige de gore, le upboads blease :DDDDdd
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:16:21
No, I am not, alternative cryptocoins are being pumped and their recent growth has not been organic, im not missing anything here. 1 coin is on top, Bitcoin, while 20 other so coins are making up a quarter of the market between all of them.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:18:47
What does that mean, on-chain transactions? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:31:57
No more central banks, no more currency issued as debt.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:14:57
wait until it reaches 0
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:54:57
You dont have to believe me.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:52:44
So he just pumps and dumps?
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:20:47
im not selling my btc until I die or the last block is mined. and I intend to live forever.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:04:19
Oh thats a lot in tx fees.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:35:43
I'm authoritarian now. But with bitcoin. AltCoins will submit.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:39:44
Yes in a sense there's no adoption if people feel intimidated in buying a piece of a whole. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:00:24
it went up from 1150 to 1175 for me, im riding this rollercoaster
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:05:28
Holy shit 85k
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:50:06

@_date: 2017-03-19 13:44:09
 was it coinbase?

Your theoretical example is ridiculous because people are using right now cash and bitcoins to trade for CP, not supplies from the home depot.
Businesses like Lowes are not enabling CP, but bitcoin as a medium can do it.

Then it sounds like you just want to buy and hold bitcoin. Seriously when it comes to mining BTC we just cant compete because electricity in china is dirt cheap since they dont mind all the smog produced.
And we in the west are antinuclear because we have to please the liberal left with everything.

You have to understand, sometimes even data, hard factual data is used to try and scare people into selling so others can buy just a few dollars cheaper, having said that, even 760 is a possibility is someone dumped lots of coins/
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:26:15
Wow 
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:44:10
Thousands really, or a small number, depending how you sell.
If you sell coins at cut rate prices it would take a small amount temporarily while you sell them. It could also be seen as a thief unloading stolen coins, though unlikely since we have blockchain to verify thankfully.
 Or you could sell a high number constantly meeting the current market offer rate thus constantly pushing the price lower and lower.
I hope I made some sense.

Bitcoin is **1** cryptocoin which makes 70% of the total market share

This is the same story with any futures market, it's very high stakes gambling. What happens when you can trade something without owning it and can print fraudulently proof of ownership in a stake or amount of a product to sell it?(because banks can't defraud right?)
Silver, Palladium and Platinum it's the same story, I have warned people about this before, beware the futures markets because the people who own the cash printing machines have no qualms with printing a few millions for themselves at your expense.

Bitfinex does not quote US dollars, the price point in dollars is based off of USDT or tether, a cryptocurrency they pegged to the dollar which is trading at 90 ish cents to the dollar. If im saying something wrong here I hope to be corrected but i dont trade in btc/usdT, I trade in btc/usd
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:02:06

Yeah no shit, when you cant draw fiat and your only recourse is to buy what the hell can you do? Unless you want your money to sit on someone elses accounts until the exchange issues get fixed but thats quite the risk

Oh nevermind, after about 200 or so sold coins he took out his sell and the price shot up $1 hahaha
@_date: 2017-04-06 07:01:53
I bought some in march at 1200, dipped to 970 at the lowest, I bought in around 990 and 1050,ive recovered my losses and am about to make "profit" on my original buy-in.
I look forward to another dip.
@_date: 2017-04-26 02:04:32
good vid, i agree people buying now should be careful, price can reach a high point, stagnate a few days, go down a bit and take an elevator down when someone decides to sell big or many people selling fast.

politicians do not control the fed. the chairmen of the fed do. politicians are not greedy due to the fed, they fear them. the money is endless so long as the us fed government emits bonds to pay the fed... its endless no matter which way you look at it. even with or without the threat if hyper inflation nothing stops the money printers but their whims.

im actually surprised that after all volatility that bitcoin is again today flirting with 1200 again on Gdax and that trade volume is in the 6k range. 
Just a few hours ago I saw hundreds of coins being sold a few minutes after the price reached 1205, but was more surprised that BTC not falling below 1190, it went down to 1170's like 4 days ago or less?
@_date: 2017-04-14 00:44:39
I mean the asics bitmain sold where asicboost compatible but the miners sold to consumer from bitmain had it disabled

regarding the issues with bitcoin in china, you can find a seller on LocalBitcoins, but they will more than likely charge a premium for person to person trades, as of now I believe China is a bit strict when it comes to purchasing Bitcoins.

Or, get this, an endless supply that comes from private banks and is instead lent to the government at cost on interest(the value of which is greater than the sum of all fiat on the planet).

@_date: 2017-04-27 00:09:56
In a sense yes because to make gains on arbitrage some will buy where it is obviously cheaper and sell on bitfinex by taking the risk of being unable to withdraw US Fiat to their own bank accounts and hoping bitfinex makes good on their promise to pay back.

I do not see it not being endless when more money can be printed and put into circulation. The issue is whether or not the money is being produced endlessly but that it is in effect endless by the process through which the money is produced, second of all the president of the usa choosing the fed president is only a formality the fed is not a federal institution and does nto need to heed the president or congress in anyway.

The US federal reserve is made up of private entities who make up its board of directors, usually the heads of other big private banks, we know this because it's right [here]( and [here](
To continue to believe that these private interests do not hold ANY interest of their own wrt american monetary policy is naive. They all benefit, all member banks of the federal reserve benefit, they do not feel the consequences of their actions and decisions to continually print more money as it inflates the monetary supply physically and electronically. They all make money out of printing money **that is how they operate**.
**Every single dollar printed by the fed is a loan backed by the GDP of the United States economy**, the US economy in essence works for the fed. Please research how money enters the economy.

SS is a ponzi, people where not meant to receive benefits as long as they do today back when the program started. People paying into SS today must count on others in the future paying into the system for them, you don't "pay what you get" into SS that's a gigantic fallacy.
If I have to pay into SS so that I later receive benefits, why force me into SS to begin with when I can save for myself? Such as an IRA.
To clarify: Nobody today is paying into SS for themselves, they are paying for people who go into it before them. Silent-G and Boomers paid into SS for themselves, but today Gen-x and millenials are paying for the service boomers receive.

If you own one coin at 1000, and lose 70% you lose $700
If someone bought at 4000 and lost 50% they lost $2000

**Because simply increasing the blocksize is a temporary patch not a scalable fix**.
A block size increase also means an increase in the entire chain. Every single time a *new* node is downloaded it takes even more space and more time to download and sync and remaining up to date actually makes it more difficult for the layman AND centralizes the network. BCH(bitcoin cash) already runs a majority over 50% of its nodes in VMs not actual computers in a distributed way. 
The entire point is for people from all over the world to be able to run a node and continue to distribute the ledger. Not leave it up to a few centralized servers in china.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:02:29
That 70% in 2014 is not as big as 50% in 2017, you should know that.

we have to wait on consensus forever to keep libertarians happy or something.
@_date: 2017-05-15 22:02:49
We need to continue to wait for consensus so bitmain and antpool and jihan can continue to mine empty blocks with asicboost, we've been through this already
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:37:42
I have to ask, I how does shorting bitcoin work? I take a margin trade for bitcoin and hope the price goes up or what?

Asicboost damages the security of the network. Fuck jihan and bitmain 
Why you would white knight for him beyond me.
@_date: 2017-05-15 18:51:48
How do I scam with this?
@_date: 2017-05-14 05:24:55
Never really, we need to wait on "consensus" to allow Bitmain and Antpool to mine more empty blocks.
And now someone will tell me they are well within their right to do so. Or that Antpool doesnt have a big share of neither mining hashpower nor the responsibility that comes with it for the network.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:57:49
of course its stupid, it hurts asicboost. also mining empty blocks is really good for bitcoin too!

@_date: 2017-05-14 05:50:32
Top red = sell offers, bottom green = buy offers. price in the middle between red and green = market price and the "distance" in value between each is the 'spread' if the highest offer is $1 and the lowest sell offer is $1.02 the spread is 0.1 cents

Since you believe in "climate change science" can you do me one favor?
Can you recreate the experiments with the model**S** used for the basis of climate change and demonstrate repeatable results? I mean after all that *is* what science is about, right? Not insults and donald drumpf
I also find it very funny that people say "you are stupid you have low iq", but if a race realist suddenly says IQ matters all of a sudden iq is racist and a bad metric.

The same thing I warned about on this very sub, the true way bitcoin can die, with paper certificates, a fraud made to drive down the price of bitcoin. This is truly how damage is done to  a healthy economy. Trade "certificates" of bitcoin. 
These certificates in no way shape or form represent nor are bitcoin. Truly as with gold and silver we will not find say 2 3 or even 7 owners of the same certificate. That's never happened /s

You are either in on the scam or dan himself. In the original post he claimed he buys a batch of 1000 miners, re-sells them for 1200...
Also you dont buy S9 "direct from china", you buy them from bitmain, who are a chinese company. There is no going "direct to the factory" with bitmain.

Just like with every anarcho-tyranny fueled government like we have in the united states. Whatever level of collectivization or retarded magic money scheme we have in the USA(the fed and QE) we are all the worse for it.
At the end of the day people don't give a shit about such concepts of a fascist or socialist government or things like freedom, they want to work and have a roof over their heads for themselves and their children. You will never see the libertarian party and philosophy grow because as we all know "the libertarian party has been infiltrated by conservatives".

Then do it, dont wait for someone to ask you in a PM, oh wait this is a scam. It takes you 7,000 to get the solar panels and evergy to run 1 miner, which costs 1200, and you are buying 1,000 miners?
So you need 1.2 million USD for 1000 miners, and on top of that close to 7 million dollars worth of solar panels and controllers+batteries, ok dude.

You can spend bitcoin on purse io and get a 5% discount or more just as with a debit card.
Bitcoin is not issued by any one entity meaning as a decentralized currency, yes it's true people "hodl" because as of now it's being used as a store of value and it seems counter intuitive to exchange fiat for BTC and then go shopping but that's how things are now we are hoping to change that for the better in the coming months and years.

You're probably talking about renting 20TB of storage? 
Because if so then the point flew way over your head and you have not proven me wrong. How many people do you expect to pay an additional $500 a month to run an independent bitocoin node?
Unless you can show me how you get 20TB for a flat $500 and no additional cost other than internet network costs.

You didn't post anything or start a discussion of anything, you just dumped a link to a wikipedia of che guevara and added nothing to it. 
No context of why you posted it or what about che you would have liked to discuss.
But there's one thing I like about che guevara, he put homosexuals into gulag prisons for virtue of being homosexuals. :)


Obviously not **FTA**:In an effort to eliminate social inequalities, Guevara and Cuba's new leadership had moved to swiftly transform the political and economic base of the country through nationalizing factories, banks, and businesses

They never do, we know full well who they are, many such cases... my point being that there is a striking double standard when it comes to which spies are ok to do damage to the USA.
You can see for yourself how many "model minorities" of chinese americans for example turned out to be spying for china! But you don't hear it often, you hear about the russians. The Israelis are the worst when it comes to the spy game, but they are never extradited, they know full well once they get to israel, no matter what they will be protected.
The only reason Israel had material for nuclear capabilities was because they stole them from the USA! You don't hear about it in any textbook I have ever read. But still they remain our greatest allies.

"The government" has a fiat money printer which can be used to buy up all the cryptocurrency in the markets right now. They don't do it because the cryptos already in people's hands would greatly appreciate in value.

BTC right now, has a 1 MB per block limit and an average of 1 block every 10 minutes.
Given the typical size of the average transaction, if you divide the block size by the transaction size and divide that result by 600 seconds you'll get an average number of transactions that can realistically confirm per second.

This is your thread in which again you only posted a link to che guevara's wikipedia article, you added no context as to why you posted it and you never even showed a willingness to discuss your personal political beliefs so what's there to discuss?


What exactly am I denying here, the holocaust, because as far as I understand it the only time "denier' is used as an epithet is in that case.
You as a socialist/communist want the exact sae things the political establishment in europe canada and the USA want.

I said 3 houses. Accomodations are provided to senators and congressmen, your point is moot. You don't find it a bit much that the socialist candidate that says "the rich have a bit too much" owns a car and 3 houses worth much more than the net worth of his average supporter? That doesnt say anything to you? it speaks volumes to me.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:00:17

@_date: 2017-06-24 10:28:40
not all mitm work like that

@_date: 2017-06-14 19:40:28
Also the drop is quite recent, at about 2 hours ago the price was 2750 or something

The Federal Reserve is private owned by a handful of individuals (who also own the major Private Banks).
These handful of individuals make money on
1. Receiving regular coupon on treasury bonds from the Treasury (your taxes)
2. Interest payments from loans (usury)
If everyone attempted to pay back their loans, all currency would cease to exist before we ran out of debt to be paid. Republicans who say they want to pay off the national debt are talking out their asses - it is literally impossible since our entire economy collapse as currency disappeared.
Economic recessions are caused by tying inflation/deflation to a debt backed currency. Democrats who say they want to regulate businesses to prevent economic collapse are likewise lying through their teeth.
Hitler nationalized the central bank and offered interest free loans.
If you want to cripple the globalists, stop using banks and advocate for anti-usury.

His opinion is really well ignorant. He says butcoin is losing market share, but market-share to what? other coins? this is why I keep saying it's retarded to compare cryptos this way, bitcoin is still bitcoin, 1 independent cryptocurrency and it has "lost market-share" to 15-18 other crytos which is an unfair as fuck comparison.
the last ATM hit peak at 2896USD, when pullback hit it reached the low 1900's, 1800 ill believe it if someone call pull me some charts and link them. but even then for the last week it has remained above 2100 at today its close to surpasing 2500, all in a few days time.

Money does indeed come into the economy from thin air.
**HOW CURRENCY ENTERS THE ECONOMY**
When the government wants to spend money, the National Treasury (which stores the funds of the US govt) sells treasury bonds. The Federal Reserve (privately owned central bank) then prints currency to buy these treasury bonds. Private Banks act as an intermediary between these organizations, buying treasury bonds and selling them to the Federal Reserve at a profit. The end result is that 1. the Federal Reserve has treasury bonds, 2. Private Banks make a profit, 3. the National Treasury has cash. The government then spends this currency on a variety of things - about 90% of the US budget is medicaid, medicare, the military, and social security; in other countries the spending breakdown varies but in the context of this post we can ignore where this money goes because ultimately most of it ends up in circulation. 
(*Note that the Treasury owes the Fed a return on the treasury bond greater than the initial amount that the bond was purchased for, meaning the government owes more currency to a private bank than there exists currency.* The federal income tax was originally implemented in the US to pay the regular coupon - kind of like an interest payment on a bond - from the treasury to the federal reserve on all existing bonds)
FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING
When money enters the economy it ultimately ends up in a bank. It might change hands several times first, but it ends up in the bank account of a person or business at a Private Bank. For the last ~500 years, western banking has operated on a Fractional Reserve system. This means that only a small % actually needs to be kept in the bank for daily bank transactions and the rest can be loaned out. Whenever a bank loans out money it effectively increases the amount of currency in circulation. The person/business that takes out a loan spends the money and it ends up in another Private Bank, and the process repeats adding currency to the supply each time. Since interest is owed on every loan at every step of the way, the total amount of debt is even higher than the total amount of currency in circulation.
BOOM/BUST CYCLES - ECONOMIC RECESSIONS
The amount of currency in circulation (ie. inflation/deflation), the amount of debt owed on loans, and economic growth are all proportional to one another, this causes inevitable market bubbles and crashes. When people take out loans they spend that cash to stimulate the economy and currency is simultaneously created by the fractional reserve system. This drives the bull economy of abundance that precedes every crash. When people have money, they pay off their debts. This destroys currency and causes deflation which causes a market crash. Since a much larger amount of debt now exists than the currency to pay it off, there will inevitably be (likely millions of) people who are forced to default on their loans, face foreclosure, and declare bankruptcy losing everything they own. To add insult to injury, in the most recent US recession the few banks that lost money on this were then bailed out using taxpayer money - far more numerous however are the banks that profited off the entire cycle.
