Having the USB 3.0 instead of the OG PCIE is great as it is one less thing to fail. The extra atx power is great as well since you dont have to use an add2psu.

Wish people realized Bitmain is China. China is Bitmain. The sheer amount of energy being consumed by Bitmain right now is staggering. They own 30 plus percent of the Bitcoin hashing power at any given time before those units get shipped. 
The energy requirements consume more than an entire power plant. 
No way Wu does this without the government getting a taste. 
Think about the day when BTC is so high these millions of coins will represent buying power and economic prowess for China for centuries. They will be able to buy out entire industries. This is far from alarmist.

First off any screen writer can write about bitcoin if they do a little research. Just adding the word bitcoin in front of something doesn't make it a thing.

My friends called her the butterEx

The cynic in me sees this as a play by the top five or so mining operations to drive down the price to push out mid size farms and small fries. The sheer amount of hashing power Bitmain alone has right now is a staggering 30 plus percent.
We are already seeing miners in high cost electricity areas struggle.
in 20 years these whales will have INCREDIBLE economic power.

All they have to do is spend some r&amp;d cracking the algorithms of Bitmain and release open source miners or even brand specific miners and push them out of the space that way. The recent discoveries only bolster this argument. 
Whatever way we look at it Bitmain is the evil empire here. They are stashing MILLIONS of Bitcoin and control 30 plus percent of the TOTAL bitcoin hashing power.

What people need to understand is the systemic duping of western money in china is so widespread that it could account for 20+ percent of GDP at any given time. 
There are entire cities there that are props.
