You have to link your bofa bank account and send it that way, not a debit card

Can you answer 2 was: 
1) was this a personal account or business account?
2) did you try to deposit into the account or debit your debit card?

Ok this is not allowed so there’s your answer. You have to send it through ACH

Wait this email is about a cancelled purchase, not a cancelled withdrawal
Edit: which is to say, you tried to buy on coinbase and they canceled it, but your op is about not being able to put money from coinbase into your account

“And yes” is not an answer to “did you try to credit this to your debit card it did you try to put the money new n your bank account through ach” as you’re nit allowed to chargeback to a debit card

Not sure what to say that email is explicitly about refunding a purchase. Sounds like they might have flagged your account because you’re making a bunch of odd transactions

Wait... did you try to deposit into your account or debit onto your card?

You know what's really crazy? This behavior applies to most people who pick individual stocks, or vote for a certain candidate. It is super weird to see in action on message boards, that's for sure.
