This is Fox News, you guys better not listen to it all, there is nothing sensible to expect here

I don't understand people who put their life savings into bitcoin. Everybody knows it's not a perfect system

Cool.  They should extend 100% reserves to the banking sector as well (doh!).  Good for the goose, good for the gander.  I'm not intimidated by regulatory attempts as we all should know the driving force behind it (big banking/finance).

ICANN just saturated the market with a bunch of alt domains

Now that's just plain and simple stupid. Mobile mining....

hahha funny, but ask anyone about normal money? about how does the whole system work? you'll see the same result

I hope bitcoin can help in a true revolution. It's about time people woke up from their sleepwalking
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:10:51
Well, that's good! But you'd better also keep your eyes on these deals.

sounds very futuristic, but that's true, and people just need time to get used to it.

So it is possible to send a beer to frined using any coins as you wish, isn't it?

They're welcoming a whole new financial paradigm. That makes it a nice place for bitcoin system
@_date: 2014-02-18 10:26:54
What benefit would this regulation bring to me? 
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:59:54
That's really great! Thanks a lot for this source!

I've said it many times and I'll say it again: the big industry won't go down quietly without one hell of a war.  I'm still waiting to see if oil industry will jump on board with crypto.  Talk about a lot of people losing their piece of pie!

Banks are going downhill from here.
They have been at it for too long already, it's time to take those greedy fuckers down.
In bitcoin we trust.

Just a pair of underpants? Bitcoins priorities look not so attractive
