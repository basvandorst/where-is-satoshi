Lol. Debt is not bad. It makes an economy and business grow. Besides, btc isn't suitable for a modern economy because of fixed supply. It's only a store of value.

'I'm starting to think...' 10 years too late.

Unless everything is paired to a stablecoin instead of shitcoin btc, it won't affect anything.

I think you are very stupid and don't understand basic economische. Btc cannot serve as a payment method due to fixed supply. Has been stated over and over, even on this board. Only a stablecoin can serve as a payment method. Btc is at most a store of value, no more than that, if it survives

Even if the banks collapse (which wouldn't happen, the system is strong and works well in the western world), these people can't understand that you can't use a coin with fixed supply as a payment method. The people that talk about the collapse of banks are highly deranged basement dwellers living outside of reality. Cryptogrip is one of them. One of the most deluded posters on this board - his predictions are always wrong as well.

People want it to be decentralized so nothing happens. The stubborn libertarians think that every centralization is bad.

Lol. Because you think there is no manipulation in crypto? It is 100 times more manipulated than the stockmarket. Every big price rise or fall is caused by manipulation by exchanges and cryptocompanies who pump and dump their own coin.

Viewing alts as competition is wrong view. The more alts are being adopted, the better for Bitcoin. Bitcoin itself isn't going to be adopted as a payment method, so it is dependent on the success of alts.

Centralized crypto = the future. Decentralized systems never worked in the history of human being, neither do decentralized crypto like btc work (no usecase, highly manipulated). Centralization and regulation are needed to make a system work. That's the lesson we learned from crypto and btc.
