I never get sick of this being constantly brought up...
Oh wait, yes I do.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:39:36
You sound like a man with a pineapple up his ass.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:24:58
The lack of originality is tedious.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:40
And some will punch you in the face for saying it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:20:09
The Quickening. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:48:42
Or buy more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:21:42


@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:09
Hick? Redneck? Fuck you people are assholes. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:10:58
Ethereum is far better value at the moment imo.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:01:16
Rise and shine, Korea. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:08:25
That was minutes ago. 
Where have you been? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:24:03
I'll live.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:25:26
It's what he would have wanted.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:43:18
Tee hee. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:51
Was that supposed to be a dip? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:29:47
I know you aren't. 
It'd be nice if they toned it down though. It's not a term of endearment the way these people are using it, more mocking "Southern white trash" etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:13:05
Stop calling people rednecks. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:14:52
Perhaps back to 2010 might be a little more profitable. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:10:45
Er, did you just compare the biggest daily increase in bitcoin history a dead cat bounce? 
We must have different definitions of that term. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:25:45
It is incredible that you can't see how bigoted you are being. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:39:03
What dip? 
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:36:23
That didn't really answer his question, did it?
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:51:29
Very strange that getting so close to the ATH has elicited no mention whatsoever though, don't you think?
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:44:02
That would be the ultimate hand job experience.
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:59:29
This place has certainly gone off the boil.
@_date: 2017-02-12 12:55:25
Nice to see you wore your best T-shirt for the occasion. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:15:54
How do you know how close it was? 
@_date: 2017-02-12 12:57:06
So that would make you two? 
@_date: 2017-02-12 19:40:18
That was supposed to be a joke. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 14:41:46
Smart young man. You'll go places. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:14:54
Jesus, time for the casket. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:10:32
You were saying? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:22:04
I don't consider insurance free either. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:34:23
Are you trying to say that a lifetime of paying taxes is cheaper than a hospital bill?
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:05:54
They are paid for by the taxpayer.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:33:59
Not an argument either. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:53:16
You'll pay much more over a lifetime, friend. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:45:16
Your chances of getting that sick are tiny, believe it or not. The money that everyone pays in tax to keep something like Britain's NHS afloat is far more than the vast majority takes out of it in services. 
You are thinking of the worst case scenario. If you are worried about that happening I'd advise taking out a comprehensive insurance policy (which is a voluntary action).
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:36:31
That is still not free. 
Just because you pay for something in small increments, it doesn't make the service free. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:25:04
Fucking noobs.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:53:57
Not an argument. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:06:37
Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:39:58
I know what a government provided service is, but calling it free is disingenuous, or misguided. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:59:48
Ethtrader is one of the biggest shitholes on reddit. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:21:13
Shh, don't tell him... 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:33:24
That is not free, by definition. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:19:08
Hospitals will always find a way to turn a profit. Being fully funded by the government (read taxpayers) won't reduce their charges, quite the opposite.
As for many Americans not being able to cover unexpected bills over $400, the notion of personal responsibility has been lost unfortunately through the state being such a fucking nanny to everyone. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:09:36
Who personally pays millions of dollars for treatment?
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:36:00
I'm not from the US. Nice assumption. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:23:40
Where on this planet is healthcare free? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:03:29
How often does that happen? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:12:55
Nothing about what you just said makes it free in any way, shape or form. That is the topic under discussion here.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:08:51
Paying taxes is paying for healthcare, whether you need it or not.
It is you who is being obtuse in thinking that having your money siphoned off in small increments, to pay for something that you are most likely not going to need in any major way, constitutes healthcare being free.
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:48:52


You have no idea if this is the middle or not. Best time to scoop up cheap BTC anyway, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:04:21


Citation needed.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:05:29


No, it is still taking a heap of money from you though, just without end.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:53:13
I believe you. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:56:51
That's why people have insurance, to cover broken arms etc. The argument here is that people seem to think things like the NHS is free, when it is far from it. 
As for advice on which policy is right for you, talk to an insurer.

Member @_date: 2016-12-23 22:01:47
He was a constant pest just after the ATH was reached, predicting nothing but doom and gloom for btc and mercilessly mocking everyone for believing in its potential. 
His dedication to his cause was remarkable. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:55:06
Sharing, huh? Damn Commie! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:17:09
By your calculation it should have taken just under 20 days then?
Hardly snail's pace.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:44:51
Just pay your taxes and stop trying to be a sneaky, lazy fuck. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:40:42
Getting smaller.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:42:00
[Hell yes.]( Exciting times.
I'm old enough to remember trolling us all.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:20:51
It is far faster even when considering the percentage.
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:16:15
We've got another one on the hook, lads!
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:05:41
Stop capitalising that c brah. This isn't 2012. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:15:52
Doesn't count.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:35:14
What do you mean "get almost nothing" after paying your taxes? 
Capital gains tax in my country is 19%.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:39:48
It seems you are the retard here. 
You have no idea that the fees for your dollar transaction is baked into your bank fees. 
I challenge you to send a figure in the millions for the same amount it costs to send bitcoin, and in the same timeframe. 
Your idea that its worth nothing because its not inflationary (your idiotic notion that you should be able to gather in 13 bitcoins for one to truly make a gain is truly spastic) doesn't hold water for any asset. Should your investment property suddenly become 13 houses to have gained in value, or is it the dollar value of said property determine whether or not you have invested well? 
So bitter. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:47:10
Ethereum is not our enemy. It is a protocol that I am personally invested in too.
The future is crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:49:12
That  is the silliest jab at bitcoin I have heard yet.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:18:43
I know, but that was an obvious one.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:03:44
Do you say the same about gold? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:54:39
Good call. Didn't convert too early, I hope. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:56:00
That is an incredible stat.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:44:06
It was poorly received for such a meme-centric community.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:43:51
You sound bitter. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:30:46
Stupid ass. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:11:03
Brother, that wall could be taken down or eaten up at any time. 
This is crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:32:54
Stop being an asshole, newbie. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:37:02
Get out.

Bitstamp and Bitfinex.

Eat eat eat away at that wall, world.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:32:21
Give it time, son. 
Reddit dickishness consumes us all eventually. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:34:56
Er, what are you talking about? It took 1200 days to double, and two days to increase by 11 percent. 
It increased far faster even considering the percentage. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:04:59
I know. It was a joke.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:55:32
Go to bed. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:34:42
Actually, exactly the opposite of 40 years ago. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:37:00
How has it "come a long way since apartheid" exactly? 
By all objective measures it is turning into a failed state.
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:39:45
