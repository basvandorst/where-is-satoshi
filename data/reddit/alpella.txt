Obviously it is not. 
I was actually waiting for someone to see and weight the idea as I am very much curious about the opinions.
@_date: 2015-06-06 22:02:41
Would you mind giving some feedback to my work?

I am the head engineer at Coinvoy.net. 
We have a payment API for this purpose. You can read more on  the website is under construction though.

So, i would appreciate if you help me evaluate and improve:
It is a trustless bitcoin wallet. Popcorntime is quite impressive for us, so the project took off to provide an easy user interface that covers complex bitcoin technologies.
Design period was mainly a discussion within the team: 
It has to:
* be so secure that we (whoever has the hashes) cannot crack it even we have x number of 8-GPU nutcrackers.
* be anonymous unless user wishes otherwise.
* offer password/PIN recovery.
* be very easy and interactive.
Resulting wallet -yet closer to proof-of-concept- is there and have some information on how it works. The pages lack diagrams and finery but I guess who are familiar to them should be able to understand it.
We have been working on this scheme for some time along our daily jobs and I would really use some community help.

Try coinvoy.net
Edit: Sorry.. I missed a part here, but better not to use online wallets anyway. :)
@_date: 2014-01-16 06:18:27
Could you please explain why should it go down while utility is going up? Any comments are of course welcome, and i can also speculate as much as i like, as we are not yet familiar with free market behavior. 
Please, go on and explain, why a biased paper (one way or another) would have more importance than any other guess.
For me, proof for a guess is the adoption. I hope you choose wisely :) This one is for me too.
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:50:30
What mess?
@_date: 2014-09-15 23:21:31
Thanks for sharing. I am also giving the hints - not explaining enthusiasticly, cause it is better (healthier) to be calm - and people are getting interested in it, one way or another. One talk leads to making someone understand that it is not lost when a computer is kaput, the other one leads to a critic of current system. Even Chinese granddads listen with care... I love them :D
@_date: 2014-09-21 14:55:52
I have just informed him about it. Outcry auction seems very fancy :) Thank you!
@_date: 2014-09-26 19:47:13
coinvoy.net is probably for you. It doesn't require any registration, but its still in beta. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 10:54:27
Have a good time all! Thank you for working on such a nice project!
@_date: 2014-09-17 09:03:28
They are for low-level development. You may want to use coinvoy.net to build a merchant app.
@_date: 2014-09-17 06:21:46
so true. I am concerned to be labeled as "a bunch of (tattood/anarchist/sci-fi) nerds". That label actually/unfortunately is a quite accurate one, if one look superficially. 
By the way, I am also joking my parents about them wearing spanish panths with high heels around 70's and 80's, but this still doesn't change that they are wonderful people. :)
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:18:12
Nice! Thanks

I have one in development to be released in about two months. It is a very easy to use p2p market and I am planning to go open-source. 
Also you can code one yourself using coinvoy.net's escrow feature.
@_date: 2014-09-21 14:38:35
wow. thanks!! its my first tip :)
I guess it is a bit sarcastic but what did you mean exactly?
@_date: 2014-09-21 14:39:36
I really don't believe he can manage an escrow. :) he is above 60 but still enthusiastic about btc.
@_date: 2014-09-22 10:56:32
Greetings!!! We have come very close to a solution so let me relist all options here so that it be useful :)
- Bitcoin ATMs $500-$1000 limit, 3-6% fee
- CoinCafe in NYC, no limit, 3% fee, needs registration
- New York at 40 Broad Street - Outcry auctions (no idea yet)
- Localbitcoins.com has a very good reputation and verification service, but couldnt fully understand who first provides (the money or the code?) $5000-$10000 limit, 4-8% fee
- Community rocks!! Two nice people offered me help with lower fees
Thank you very much everybody!

Additionally, tax dollars are generally spent for guns, missiles, intelligence, manipulation and religion. What else would you like to add to the list?
@_date: 2014-12-02 17:50:17
Bithost is good. Haven't seen a downside for longer than a year.
@_date: 2014-10-25 04:45:27
Coinvoy is the way to go. It is a third party website only to forward and invoice your payments, otherwise you would require a bitcoin node with over 15GB of blockchain. 
Fortunately they are now designing a full web functionality where it only uses the server to broadcast transactions, which is the minimum requirement when sending bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:42:17
Actually it is a very good question. I will try to do my best answering it:
I think main driving force lies in merchants, which is fine. On the other hand for buyers;
- It is very simple. No birth certificates. No debt. No need for support. No broken magnetic cards. No deducted fees etc. Personally, I like it because I know how to manage my funds. You may rightfully say when one doesn't know how it works one doesn't have that advantage. This is the same when using CC, no one knows how it works. It is just a matter of getting used to.
- Buyers use it, most importantly, because they can. We send an email, because we can.
- Inflation is a very important concept although it is obviously swept under. Freshly produced fiat is simply called stealing, -please object if you dont think so- where all generated value is taken by governments. (right?) So we should be aware of it, as we are aware of economic unequality, (I humbly think owning over 1 billion usd equivalent should be ethically forbidden.)
That's it for now. I think it is possible to argue more. Thanks for bearing.
@_date: 2015-08-24 00:22:57
A great tool! thanks
@_date: 2015-08-24 00:22:30
Someone found it. What was the puzzle behind?
@_date: 2015-08-23 21:22:32
Would you like to present any clues?
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:47:42
There is also a piece of DMT in the address. Anything to do with that?

Have been paying for hosting and VPS for a long time. Sometimes visiting BitCoffee at Buenos Aires, especially when I don't want to withdraw overpriced Pesos. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:47:56
So we built Coinvoy.net wallet to overcome all of this. 
Though it is not on iOS yet, it is safer than a cold wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-17 17:05:30
You can do it easily using Coinvoy.net payment API, where you can enable escrow.
Here is the [docs](
Sorry for the styling, currently we are re-establishing the frontend for our new wallet.

Yes, I am not an expert but it is called arbitrage and it is basically a way to make money while balancing different pools (economies), if you are able to trade in both two jurisdictions.
This is profitable until the difference does not compensate for commissions anymore.

From wiki ([Crypto-anarchism]( 


I remembered a related argument in the history of the same page:


In addition, it could also shatter the internet economy, which would mean a total collapse, or return to historical ages. I can reason a lot of plots after that but I keep it for myself now. Anyway, Indian government is not alone, it is just the downfall of nation states.

People were very much interested when the price went up. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:30:19
There are some candidate solutions right now and they will be evaluated for some time until there is an actual need for that -when 1mb blocksize limit is hit, which will definitely take some time. 
We will engineer Bitcoin, standing decentralized, as far as it gets. For non-technicals, the good news is, there is no theoretical problem. The lowest limit (the weakest link) is bandwidth and fortunately will increase and will not stand in the way. 
Objecting that is like "PC will never be feasible" or any other like "it is impossible to do x" where x is anything which can easily be done today. Thank god we have time :)
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:10:36
As far as I understand, sidechain application is a way to utilize all computing power in one network to secure several public ledgers. It is necessary, as several chains cannot be maintained and reliably secured by alternating hash rates. 
So what we can do is to unite "value" (bitcoin), "vote", "law", "asset", "blockBoard" etc in those chains and have only one network to look after; all votes, messages etc are permanently fixed by the network. 
"Value" has to fulfill its part completely without restrictions. Voting should be completely functional. Hence, Bitcoin should perform its best even though there may be other "value" candidates, I believe evolutionary selection will do its best here.
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:46:13
yeah, it smells fishy coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:59:31
Yes, I hope so. It is actually requested from random.org api.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:18:42
Yes, exactly. This is why we need to elaborate on this subject, if possible.
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:05:29
Congrats!! It seems lovely. Though as it is said, all options, no confusions, it should be great. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:10:44
Nice!! Up up!
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:33:31
Done so -&gt; 5%. But i think you are underestimating risks involved; they force me to work on possible vulnerabilities. 
In fact, you can give it a try, why not?
@_date: 2013-05-13 20:42:51
I agree. It was a kind of mistake actually, but we (at least i) need an faster and easier way to exchange it, more, i would like another tap to flow, otherwise mtgox or any kind of enforcement would destabilize this lovely(!) system. I dont know actually, it is a subject to discuss. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:57:57
It was a reference to my reddit profile. Anyway, I can give out some balance i you'd like to try.

How do think i should settle that?
@_date: 2013-08-04 16:09:07
Everything has its time and coercion for tax also had a great one. World is, as we percieve is high-definition in all aspects. Let's all see what happens when banks and governments get smaller. Some countries seem to be ok (like Canada?) but my belief is that in general what you pay mainly goes to military and propaganda, you may get the rest if you are lucky (like Canada?) Governments are doomed (or blessed) to be local governments for regulation only. 
We shall see. Future is brave enough.

I have been trying to buy some bitcoin for a time and it is a FAIL. Along with similar experiences we all knew that a new exchange medium is always necessary. I am going to go for one as a project, however I would be really glad to see some initiative to invite me into the coding. Really guys, lets build reliable and easy exchange hubs as many as we can!
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:49:30
I conclude provably fair concept is not nice and does not include anything like really fair. But i can display random.org requests live if it was necessary.
