Agreed. Would you say that it's not unreasonable to say that \*some\* percent of every individuals portfolio should be in a non correlated asset such as bitcoin? Even if that percentage is minuscule wouldn't you want something non correlated just like you'd like something negatively correlated such as gold for stocks?

Hopefully this won't trade at a premium but the underlying liquidity that they can provide (amount of btc they can accumulate to back this) isn't that big which may cause a premium unlike in their other offerings. It really comes to the amount of demand that this will create.

That was the idea that I was trying to make in the first post. Of course I'm a crypto fan as well and believe strongly that there is huge potential for blockchain and DLT to disrupt in many industries.

Can you explain what it means that CXBTF redeems units at the end of each day and how that mechanism allows them to not have a premium?

It's understood that there is no one size fits all for financial advise, however when talking from a macro perspective wouldn't you say every portfolio should have negatively correlated as well as non correlated assets as some part of the portfolio just as basic hedging strategy? What those percentages are or what form they should take doesn't matter be it bitcoin and gold or something else.

Why is this important if GBTC which is an investment trust and has been available to US consumers for years isn't?

The amount of demand created by offering it in USD will be new. I'm aware that it's been offered in CHF and Euro for years but the USD offering is what is interesting to those who hold the idea that 'institutional money is still on the sidelines'. I am curious to see how much of a premium if any this will have given unprecedented demand. GBTC had almost no premium at first as well.
