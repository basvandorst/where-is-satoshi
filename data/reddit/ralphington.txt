If you think a global downturn in the economy is good for bitcoin, you are delusional.

The reason bounty posts get shot down on stackoverflow is because it is fundamentally against the kind of community they strive for. They don't want a bunch of people looking for work and a smaller set of experts doing the work. They want a community who works together to give great answers to great questions. They don't always get it right, but that is the main reason why they don't want people paying for answers. You are always welcome to look in users' profiles for contact information if you want to pay them for some consulting. My first meat post when SO was in beta was for this same thing, but for USD. I got downvoted to hell and was frankly pretty insulted. However, after listening to some of their early podcasts, I understand their reasoning.

Would be pretty funny if that were actually ghash.io internal mining trying to avoid making their own pool too large

Considering they charge a full 0.001 BTC per withdraw, they can afford the tiny 0.0001 tran fee.

As unsafe as you believe these exchanges to be for storing bitcoin, I guarantee they are safer than at least 20% of peoples' desktop computers. Speaking in absolutes here is really quite idiotic when you take that into account. You don't have to analyze very many peoples' computers to realize that it is very, very common for them to be riddled with terrible malware.

Thanks for the good news. I just fired my accountant. She was screaming like a lunatic when I made a big pile out back of our company books and set them on fire. I assured her that allgoodthings1 on reddit said accounting is no longer necessary. She didn't buy it, so she got the boot. Oh well, one less salary for me and no more accounting for my company. Yipee!
