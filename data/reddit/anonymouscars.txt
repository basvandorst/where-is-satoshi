I had not seen that video before. Thank you! I share your enthusiasm for smart contracts and the future of blockchain technology.

For most cars this is not really a big deal. However some of the luxury cars I sell have much lower turnover and much higher pricing differentials (depending on options, shipping location, availability and other factors). Those are the sales prices I would prefer not to publish to the world.

I do not sell large numbers of cars for bitcoin, but the number is growing. Obviously the pros from accepting bitcoin outweigh the cons. I am just looking for simple ways to minimize the information that is made publicly available. Obviously I never reuse addresses myself and generate a new address for each customer.

I agree about signing a NDA being insane. I just mentioned it so that nobody suggested it as an option.

Thank you for your detailed response. Some of your assumptions are correct. However most exotic and luxury car dealerships have negotiated pricing.  Customization in this market is the norm. In some cases there are issues that have a major impact on price (including extensive customization requests, import/export issues and complicated shipping methods in the cases of some buyers) completely outside of my control. 
Your advice would be more relevant to my local buyers looking at less expensive vehicles (where customization and differential pricing is less prevalent). However those happen to be the buyers who are least likely to use bitcoin. 
I am reading about proof of existence contracts now and am intrigued. Thank you for the suggestion. I want to help further bitcoin usage but have mixed feelings about providing bitcoin related referral rewards that I do not also offer to fiat customers.

Right now I pay all my employees in fiat. Any recommendations for the best companies to use for bitcoin payroll (which will be optional not mandatory when I introduce it)? Similar to my car sales concerns I do not want every employee to easily discover the income of everyone else.  Some data is already known because of our commission structure and various incentive programs but I want to limit how much information is shared.

I have heard the company name but have yet to do any research. I will follow up to learn more. Thank you.

When is the price for the winning bid going to be released?
