It would be more of an incentive to just create a single high fee tx.  This would incentivize all miners and cost you less.

The block reward eventually goes away.  Eliminating this source of volatility.  But until then...

Technically Bitcoin has already permanently hard forked several times.  And further any hard fork is technically permanent.
Most of the forks were as a result of fixing [bugs](
The most notorious being the bug that allowed someone to form a transaction that created 185 billion bitcoins.
Bitcoin was even hard forked on accident by a latent [bug](
As regards to controversial hard forks...
Here is a [relevant article]( from 2.5 years ago.

One would gladly spend a bitcoin to improve the chance of getting the 25 btc block reward.
How hard is it to know the relative propagation of two competing same height blocks?
You only need to send out the bribe if you see a competing block with sufficient propagation.
You could adjust the bribe amount based on how much the other block has propagated. Other miners would have to be running software that was able to recognize that a bribe was even being offered.
By bribe I am referring to a high fee tx spent from the contingency tx in my block that would only be redeemable if my block is not orphaned.
Edit:  I just realized that once my block is broadcast, the "contingency" tx is effectively broadcast as well.  A miner could just add my "secret contingency" tx to their next block along with the bribe tx to redeem the bribe without actually mining off of my block.
Is it possible to make a tx that is only redeemable by the bribe tx if the input came from a specific block height?
I would still want to be able to redeem the contingency tx myself if it was included at a block at some later block height.

This doesn't make sense.  If a sell order was issued then you would have cash in your account.

They would not have to reveal their identity.  Just wait till the tx is dropped by the network then create a new transaction that includes a fee.  The current software does not make this easy mostly because it is not yet needed.  But a custom client could be made to do this without any compromise to anonymity.

A losing lottery ticket's value collapses to zero on the day of the lottery.  Bitcoin value is much more complicated. It is basically the average of all perceptions of its current value.  Improbable future discoveries of cryptographic weaknesses further complicate the risk assessment.

The miner only gets the bitcoin that is not in outputs.  All of these txes had outputs that used all the bitcoin of the inputs.  In this case the outputs are addressed to the bitcoin equivalent of a black hole.

OP now has 0.00107918 BTC.
Double Twist:
OP did not make the sticker, sticker creator lost the private key long ago and 0.00107918 BTC is lost for ever.

The security boils down to how well guarded the keys are.  Not necessarily how much btc is assigned to a given key.  This is 99.9% as secure as storing 400K BTC across a thousand keys that are kept in the same file.  Having this much BTC on one key does make tracing slightly easier.

FinCEN saying that KYC laws must be followed by miners might put a damper on things.
IE A miner is only allowed to include transactions from and to people they know and have records on file for.

I know you speak wisdom.  Could you please elaborate?
@_date: 2013-04-20 21:17:06
Point of clarification.  Bitcoins are not transfered between wallets.  Bitcoins are transfered between key pairs.  Private keys are stored in wallets.  In basic mode I receive bitcoins to a public key.  I spend those bitcoins by signing a new transaction with the corresponding private key, sending them to the new recipient's public key(for which they have a corresponding private key).

The price won't be stable until the market cap for BTC is around a trillion of todays dollars.  Maybe ten trillion factoring for lost private keys.
