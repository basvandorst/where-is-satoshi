I slide that slider all the way to the left. It says stuff like 20 blocks estimated.

0.0001 is the lowest fee possible with Electrum
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:53:15
thanks. I was using the old site last night though. You think they would a put a notice on it. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:45:52
I use Electrum, which lets me choose my fee. I always pick the lowest fee. My transactions always take a hour to confirm  because of the low fee, but Ive never had a transaction stuck for 36 hours. But again, choosing your transaction fee can speed or slow down your transaction. That is always the user choice.

well what did he say?

Rosie, I would like to see a reply to Logical007's comment please.
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:42:24
what is a tainted coin?

You have to have over 85% body hair to live there though.

I lost a few when Bitcoin first started.
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:46:36
So how much was the mystery amount? And how does he leave the tip? I'm assuming he didn't have your address and already had it in some redeemable format.
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:56:21
Can you explain how they would work? And how would I make one if I wanted to pass out some bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-07-10 21:40:30
The ban from the credit cards is only for the adult section of back pages.
@_date: 2015-08-05 22:56:37
I only know 6th decimal is called bits and 8th is called satoshi
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:51:27
Please send me the link when you get something going.
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:11:21
I would be worried that after I sent my bitcoins the person doing the credit card purchase would just report it as fraud and cancel the payment and I would just lose my bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-07-23 09:52:37
Who is going to pay for it?
@_date: 2015-07-25 07:39:22
You can't post something like this without explaining it for the laymen!
@_date: 2015-07-29 00:42:04
I thought drugs were cheaper on that side of the pond
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:30:33
How about a few pages with links to different resources for bitcoiners? A page that points to general information, a page that points to different forums, list of exchanges. But make it newbie friendly.
Or make a page for all the new backpage Bitcoin users.
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:15:49
Make a list of all the faucets out there. Be sure to use your own referral links.
@_date: 2015-07-20 09:12:03
Thank you, now I have a use for the stock app.
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:47:24
I'd guess buying drugs

6:8333 /Satoshi:0.14.0(UASF-SegWit-BIP148)/
is showing with the command line option. Just wanted something for the .conf so the autostart on reboot will just keep working as is.
@_date: 2017-04-08 03:42:35
my home internet is not unlimited. Xfinity just recently started the monthly cap in my area. But I dont mind spending a couple dollars and running a node signaling my support, if it helps. If Im wasting my time and money please let me know. Are there pruning nodes that can signal support? Be cause there are some $3 VPS with only 20GB storage Id rent a few of them too.
@_date: 2017-04-08 03:37:25
so what you think they are tinkering with our servers?
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:47:08
You could try a bitcoin faucet and get some for free. Took me about a week to make .01 Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:36:28


is there something I can add the the bitcoin.conf file?
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:39:25
I use low fees a lot when the speed dont matter to me. There's also Child Pays For Parent but you have to google that for more info
@_date: 2012-01-07 00:12:28
Same, I dont want to pay to withdraw my monies!
Also after mybitcoin.com I think holding your own coins is better.
Also also you can run remote software on all smart phones and still access your coins at home
@_date: 2012-01-12 02:32:38
The way P2Pool works is you run your bitcoin client on your computer and mine to that instead of a pool, and you run the p2p application on the side to share your mining results with the reset of your peers and manage the payouts.
It helps the network by having more people running the bitcoin client. When you mine with a regular website pool you dont have to run the client, which takes away from the network.
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:35:42
You just have to wait now. Should get picked up sometime in the next few days. Low fees means longer wait.
@_date: 2012-01-12 02:19:39
Im pointing at you! 
@_date: 2012-01-12 03:35:04
The catch is he is getting referrals, but I don't mind. I signed up for you.

i have a startup script but dont know enough to edit it. But it does run the daemon on startup.

Try bitinstant.com mtgox or tradehill
@_date: 2012-01-02 12:04:45
Say your arrested and held in prison as a political prisoner for 2 years. Now you lost all you BTC.
@_date: 2012-01-12 02:17:43
I had not even thought of that. Maybe this is a smear campaign. I never had any problems with MT Gox.
@_date: 2017-04-08 03:35:47
thank you.
@_date: 2012-01-25 02:28:31
Why not Wuala. I think bitcoin people use Wuala more than dropbox.
@_date: 2012-01-12 02:16:52
Lost value is a terrible one, but they should let you know before you deposit funds you wont be able to with draw them.
@_date: 2012-01-12 03:43:05
I dont see a way to cash out your credits if you auction something. Is the only way to cash out credit is to buy things?

I think feedzebirds is a good way to advertise to tech minded people.

Any good sites to find local traders?

Would up this twice if I could just for the Pro-tip!
@_date: 2012-01-09 02:08:52
Ive used it, works fast for me.
@_date: 2012-01-06 22:57:08
If you kept mining, then when the price rebounded you would of been way ahead.
@_date: 2015-04-27 06:19:52
Always great to get new people into Bitcoin!

He's like hey what's up, hello
@_date: 2015-02-23 05:55:42
Do they have the money to buy enough bitcoins? And if they have the processing power to mine their own, why haven't they already started, it is still a resource that is harvestable.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:43:29
Thank you, OP did what he said, I'll post my referral link to my friends later.

I say the window, so as I'm driving around and casually glance out my car window and notice a bitcoin symbol in his window. Then I come inside to see what's too it. The window to bring in new outside customers.

I've always liked the Salvation Army. They helped me before when I was having a hard time.

Put a bitcoin logo in your store window.
@_date: 2015-02-22 10:52:54
If your giving away Bitcoin to non users, I would suggest having some kind of site, and you giving out a code where they could redeem on the site for the bitcoins bs just giving paper wallets with Bitcoin on them. I would think plenty of people would just set it aside and then eventually toss it or lose it, and then that coin is lost from the chain forever and your gift/refund is just wasted.
@_date: 2015-02-22 12:49:04
I'd try it!
@_date: 2015-02-23 05:52:02
The one who extended the credit.
@_date: 2013-01-27 15:52:24
Maybe they should start taking bitcoins for payment.
@_date: 2013-01-27 16:59:04
Maybe he has a older device that can't go past 4.2
