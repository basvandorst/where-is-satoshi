I’m scared for you that you may lose all of your money if you are having this much trouble figuring it out after people have shown you a couple of different equations to figure out the answer. 
Use this formula. I will list what information you will input for each letter under the equation. 
(A)_______minus (B)______times (C) ________ equals (D) _____________
A = The CURRENT price of BTC
B = The price you PAID for BTC (8,000)
C = How much BTC you bought 
D = this will be your answer after you work the math equation 
If you own an iPhone open the calculator and do the following steps: 
1. Enter the current price of BTC (today’s price) (this is the A of the above equation) 
2. Press the minus key 
3. Enter the price that 1 BTC at the time you bought some (this is the B of the above equation) 
4. Press the equal sign
  (side note:  the number that pops up after you press the equal sign is the price difference of BTC when you bought it versus what it is whenever you do this equation —- this is not the answer because this number does not take into account how many BTC were actually bought so you have to press a couple more buttons  in order to figure out the answer) 
5. Press the “x” also known as the multiplication button
6. Enter how much BTC you bought (if you bought 1 enter the number 1, if you bought .896 BTC then you would enter .896, etc) 
(This is the C of the above equation) 
7. Press the equal sign (sidenote: this is how much profit your purchase has made you thus far) (this is the D of the equation above also know as the answer to your question)
