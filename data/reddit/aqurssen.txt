If you want to buy Bitcoin safely, I recommend you to use one of the cryptocurrency exchanges. I use now [coindeal.com]( and I'm satisfied, never had any problem with it. It has a wide range of payment metods and markets.

I'd rather discourage someone who just enters the cryptocurrency field from trading at the beginning, but it doesn't change the fact that an account on some exchange might be useful to learn something. To OP -&gt; The basic thing here to do is to gather knowledge, to learn actually a lot. As much as you can - learn, read about btc, about satoshi all those articles and books are written, so you have a huge choice. CoinDeal exchange is one of the safest I know, so after you actually learn something you can start trading there, they are giving away their own token for free so you can use it for learning basics on the real example.

understandable, have a nice day

It's true, right now is a pretty nice time to buy some BTC, the price won't stay this low for a long time.


I'm using Coindeal for couple month right now and i don't think i'll switch exchange any soon. Theyve got both crypto-to-crypto and fiat-to-crypto tradings, many fiat currencies available, they support bech32 and you've got 50% discount on btc withdrawals, mandatory 2FA (two-step authentication), email confirmations for withdrawals etc.
Bitcoin ATM's are the best option if you are seeking for anonymous ways to hodl, but the fees are usually very high.

Loolz, i'm fully switching to r/CoinDeal. Can't understand this decision, maybe they've lost some during the bear and want to bounce it back during 'buy-the-dip' season...

Striving for being available worldwide is absolutely crucial for crypto exchanges so I wasn't surprised, but the giveaway is a nice addition to this

In the future electricity may be the most valuable resource for all people, even with the green electricity it's hard to say whether the final cost for regular user is going to be high or low. But when it comes to fees - like you said, with the mass adaption times, it won't be the main problem.

BTC is legal now!
@_date: 2019-06-13 13:18:35
u can use [buycoinnow.com]( if you want to buy or sell some btc, there is no kyc verification process
@_date: 2019-10-22 16:47:12
happy 18 mln to everyone!

according to their blog on [medium]( they are making a giveaway of their token for registered users, and launching their services in US is definitely a huge step forward for them

True, but it's not a good idea to hold your coins on any exchange no matter if it's centralized or decentralized even if they pay you.
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:12:10
I think you're right, there are plenty other options for such people who can't handle the complexity issue - they don't have to use it, even though simplification is always great.
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:06:11
True, that's what it has been made for. But like always, people's greed wins. We only care whether the price is at the right moment to sell or buy. Banks and governments are taking over control over the Bitcoin network, by regulating it, by adapting their financial models to BTC. They are adapting it just to swallow it whole, chew, suck out and then throw away...
@_date: 2019-12-09 16:45:52
It's such an absurd. Cryptocurrencies aren't leaving you a single step to make a mistake - otherwise all of your money migght be gone
@_date: 2019-12-09 16:44:04
Personally, I didn't havemuch problem with the process, but the fact that i had to do it like every 3 months is shitty.

Coinbase is not a bank, that's why it's still holding on. Customer service there can't be compared to the regular financial companies you've been dealing with your whole life. Coinbase in controversial (and imo one of the worst exchanges) but they are really, really big - so for now, they don't really care, until the money is being made. Try maybe reaching to the rising exchanges like Coindeal - never had any problem with them, their support is amazing and best thing there are monthly votes - every month on CoinDeal there is a USERS vote which cryptocurrency should be add next month (recently [IOTA has won]( and previous months are bringing some fantastic projects to the markets like ETC or ZEC)

If you don't want to wait couple days before you get verified use [ Even though you have to verify your account, it doesn't take longer than a day, they've got really quick support and they surely got credit card in their payment methods, but remember they've got bitcoin release sessions every 3 hrs.
