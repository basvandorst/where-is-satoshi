What does that mean 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:50:04
I do have 6 figures in crypto and am a bitcoin noob lol. Well mid 5 figures now. I can take a picture of my Trezor if you want. I have almost 3 btc on there right now. The other 3 are on another Trezor not at my house.  Please tell me why getting into crypto 3 months ago excludes me from having a 6 figure portfolio? Please tell? Are you shocked some people choose to invest large amounts as a beginning investment ? Let me tell you what I have a risky equities portfolio too that has seen 300 percent gains this year in WEED and APH. I can show mid 6 figures in that as well. My TFSA is at 6 figures alone. I can prove this all. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:59:07
doesn't mean the shorters aren't buying or have bought huge blocks to try and influence price.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:12:00
That can be said of almost anything of value.  Tell me why diamonds are so valuable?

Yea agreed. It would be much easier to pump it up then the opposite

When there is more liquidity in the futures market of an entity than the entity itself then that can lead to the big guys controlling price. It has happened before.

Why do you say Asia’s getting ready to dump btc ? Source ?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:58:22
5% of my net worth is quite a bit, i would be pissed. that said i did it anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:16:58
I think you’ll be okay. Investing in general rewards the patient. People that try to time markets especially crypto will eventually lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:21:38
lol yes. Went a bit yolo on that one, but WEED was and is the clear front runner and is the safest bet. I would consider Aphria now if I could but I am done putting money in the Weed sector I already had put way too much in to begin with but I work in the industry and really believe in Canada being at the forefront of a global movement so took a risk and it paid off. Not to say I didn't do extensive research. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:09:08
my average buyin was about 6k (late to the game), so I am holding out for 10x gains minimum. Really believe in the tech long term so most likely much longer. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:09:08
You posted 20 days ago saying you had 50k in savings and  asked should you put It in bitcoin. Safe to say you are full of shit and a liar! As someone with close to 6 figures in crypto I would bet half a coin your entire crypto portfolio is what I make in a day at my job. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:51:16
What are your thoughts on a BTC vs. ETH argument. I am 100 percent in bitcoin and am seeing people all the time shoot bitcoin down as a crypto that is going to lose its status and dissapear as ETH or others take the top spot. Am starting to second guess myself and considering maybe putting .8 of my BTC into ETH. Advice?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:19:47
10k is absolutely a lot of money to me. Not a millionaire by any means (very close). That’s irellevant. I’ve been investing long enough to know that it is monumentally stupid to pull out when a stock or asset dips unless you are exiting position entirely. I have an uncle that did that with amazon when it went to 5.

okay thanks for the advice! Just trying to see which has the most upside.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:31:01
Price point is too high, it’s like 1/4 price of the Trezor.

you need to realize for a short position to be taken someone has to buy the opposite side right?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:17:59
Why do I get the feeling the plebs with like 500 dollar portfolios are the ones freaking out. I’m down 10k USD today alone and could care less. I wouldn’t sell regardless of how low it goes, that would be pretty stupid imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:44:27
you must have like 100+ btc to justify that many wallets. I have a few btc and i just have one trezor and one cryptosteel. I highly highly reccomend the cryptosteel i love it!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:07:09
Capital gains isn’t 50 percent. 50 percent of the gains are taxable, meaning 25ish percent of the total amount of profit will be taxable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:28:41
Great post !! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:19:23
arguably the same thing when investing in high growth industries. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:02:21
We have very different approaches to investment. I recognize the fact that I am not knowledgeable enough on TA to day trade so I pick high growth stocks and hold for long periods of time. I think canopy is a relatively safe play at this point and would be kicking myself for cashing out some and missing on gains. I am hesitant that I would even be able to cash out if I see 100 dollar sp, that’s how valuable I believe this company is going to become in the next decade. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:36:25
Mid 6 figures in equities.

@_date: 2017-12-14 00:37:46
lol 50 percent of my net worth wasn't in the weed stock. initially it was about 25 percent. But yeah, still ballsy. I would consider it a safe play compared to crypto though, holy shit I thought I knew what volatility was until this!
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:42:31
my only concern is there is no wallet for iota right now, want to buy some and keep on trezor but can't
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:02:29
What about ethereum saying they handle more transactions daily? Couldn’t it be argued they can handle it ? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:35:30
biggest mistake people make are exiting positions early and trying to day trade. I pick a high growth stock I believe in and usually hold for 5 years plus. I entered CGC (WEED) and am up like 500k just on that one stock. I am holding it for 3-5 years minimum with a yearly re-evaluation. I don't fool myself into thinking I know shit about day trading. Long term is the best bet. Crypto is another beast, I put 5% of my net worth in and get the itch sometimes to sell as it makes me nervous, but I love the tech behind it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:22:07
lmfao you do? Even after letting in a million economic migrants? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:51:03

Trezor was on sale recently for 79. With shipping I would imagine that cover is closer to 30. It’s a shitty cover made in China it should be at most 5.99. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:00:48
why would they not equally by puts and inflate the price by buying large amounts? That is much easier to do and would net the same ammount of money. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:52:38
what about the possibility of BTC being overthrown by an alt like ETH?

Okay cool thanks for the heads up! Fairly new to Crypto and I love bitcion but so many other subs are talking shit about the tx times and fees and saying how ETH is superior etc.  Just want to hedge some bets in case bitcoin turns out to be as useless as they are saying (hope it wont be) 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:07:19
you'd think being around since 2013 would leave you pretty impervious to one single day of a correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:16:44
Can you explain why it won’t? With future contracts for Jan at 15.7 and presumably large amounts of money that will be behind it how could there possibly be the huge volatility that we’ve all come to know and love? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:43:05
I am inclined to agree with you. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:59:52
a million a coin. CAD.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:11:35
I let the ETH pumpers get to me telling me how superior it was to BTC. In retrospect I see the value of smart contracts, but I think there is a chance BTC continues to take off and leave the alts behind. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:12:52
Logic dicates I can buy something on my credit card and then cash out my BTC to pay off the balance. Easily plausible. Xmas dips happen quite a bit in equities so I think this may at least play a part. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:52:16
your statement could have been said at any point in Bitcoins past when it was in the hundreds of dollars, or when it went from 300 to 50. What's your explanation for the people that held through? Their pretty stupid i guess eh. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:47:13
how do i see that wall on gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:04:29
UGHHHHHHH. was going to move some of my btc to ETH yesterday, really regretting the decision not to. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:13:33
More than the price I am worried when this fucking tx fee thing is going to be solved. Every day that goes by with no progress is fucking BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:25:46
Your point is comparable to worrying about the sun burning out and all life ceasing to exist. It is not a threat that is even possible anytime soon. And it will not be hard to quantum proof btc and many other alts. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:14:34
same. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:19:19
is this good or bad for bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-12-10 20:03:43
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:21:27
That is some of the worst advice I think I have ever heard. So when I bought canopy growth at 7.50 and it went down to 6.50 I should have sold at a loss? Instead I held (because I did my own dd) and made 200k in unrealized gains. I am holding for a few years while re evaluating every so often. You sir a fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:06:19
ummm aren't capital gains like 25 % of the total profit made? 50 percent of the gains are taxable. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:09:37

@_date: 2017-12-13 21:48:44
Just turned a 3rd of my BTC into ETH and am very happy! As soon as I started doing some digging on ETH I can see  they are incredibly undervalued as of now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:33:37
While TA and other things don’t apply to crypto, I think it does have a lot of comparisons to high growth potential equities and would say that investing in it is very similar. Don’t invest in what you can’t lose as high growth is high risk, and sit for the long haul. Unless the fundamentals change I don’t see why one should panic sell crypto unless you are exiting the position completely. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:57:44

@_date: 2017-12-11 00:46:42
so wtf happens to bitcoin? We just stay here forever? What about all the grandiose predictions of 50-100k?
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:28:13
Why do you suggest euro etfs? What’s wrong with North American ones? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:00
at this point it would be easier for them to bet on a raise and pump it then short it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:35:44
it fucking blows!!! im doing the same thing. after all that volatility these measly swings are not doing it for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:40:05
I bought a Trezor from in-ear-com said they were a trusted seller. I’m worried now should I buy another one direct ?!!
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:26:09
I’m referring to people panic selling (many times at a loss) if you want to go ahead and sell at a dip then logic dictates that you are prone to rash decisions and will probably do it often, that’s a recipe to lose money almost every time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:44:29
Lmfao at 50k???!!! It would take none of that for 50. At 1 million it would be have maybe 5 percent of the world currency market ?

Okay so you owe 25 percentish, not 50. If you don’t like it incorporate a shell company offshore and obtain a bank account with a country that doesn’t share with Canada. Shouldn’t cost more than a grand.

What kind of effect on btc price do you see from this 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:41:04
is this the end of volatility? Are we going to see shitty increases from here on out? Imo if this happens we will see an exit from btc.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:57:00
haven't seen, large volume? What I don't get is who the fuck is buying the opposite end and shorting? How crazy do you have to be? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:19:58
talking about it is different than buying it. mainstream adoption is not even close to 1%. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:09:56
i just started using GDAX to watch the volatility for fun (coins are in cold storage not touching ever), is volume like this normal??? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:25:51
Yup I definitely can’t argue with your view and it is for sure the smartest approach admittedly. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:56:20
well we're seeing a dump as we speak on gdax so not sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:08:06
this is a logical fallacy. A bank controlled crypto is in and of itself not decentralized. It is a stupid argument.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:02:33
I AM PISSED AT MYSELF AND NEED ADVICE. The other day i thought it would be a good idea to turn a 1/3rd of my BTC into ETH and diversify and now I have watched myself lose a ton of money. If i were to convert back into BTC I would lose .1 btc. I regret my decision and want to turn it back, should I wait or just take the hit on the .1 bitcoin and bite the bullet. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:33:52
Yea I got in around September. 40ish k initial investment. I come from an equities background so am fairly new to it. Wouldn’t say I’m a douchebag at all, this sub just seems like it’s full of retarded idiots that don’t wish to discuss the merits or lack thereof of btc etc. And instead shitpost or straight up lie.

You have not addressed the fact there has never been a recession since bitcoins creation. We have been in a bull market almost the entire time.

Well they occur roughly 10ish years on average, I would expect one within a couple. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:14:31
that's a retarded as fuck statement. 95 percent chance of going to 100 dollars lmfao. You for sure have none or a insignificant ammount of btc.

i hope to god you are right. i have about 3 and plan on holding until it makes me a millionaire.

Hey man in same boat as you. Bought on amazon from in-ear or something. Apparently they are a trusted reseller says Trezor but I’m still unsure of what to do.

Trump is probably the best candidate to not touch BTC. If you think Obama wouldn't be more likely to straight up regulate or outlaw Bitcoin you do not know politics and watch too much CNN.

Same boat. I will never buy again. But will keep what I have.

You’re a fucking idiot/retard

For all the betas that said  "we'll do great in a market downturn" not only are you wrong but you should be drawn and quartered for having such a retarded opinion.

yea that's what i figured. So last question (sorry for bugging you) I have all my bitcoin in blockchain.info.  Once I am done buying my allotment I then purchase trezor and install the trezor wallet. I then send the bitcoin from blockchain to the trezor wallet and then it is loaded onto my trezor device? I was just a little confused because some people were saying to do multisig + trezor so I wasn't sure what that meant reallly, I thought trezor was it and not sure how to combine multi sig with trezor. Would you say trezor is safe to store large ammount of bitcoins? In the grand scheme of things I won't have much but I plan on holding for a long time and if it is potentially worth a lot in 5-10 years I want to be sure that my trezor only wallet will still be good enough. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:56:53
you're retarded.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:40:03
im reading the glacier protocol now. So if i create multi sig on electrum for example for a 2-3 sig, would i need 2 seperate wallets with seperate exchanges or could i just make 3 on electrum? Would i then transfer those onto my trezor? Sorry I am a complete noob and not understanding much of this. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:06:20
okay so i have blockchain, i understand what the multisig means but how do i get multisig. And what do you suggest as the wallet that i use to transfer to my trezor? or does it matter? so as i understand i have to make a multisig before i load my trezor?
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:42:43
Okay i am a total noob but doesn't trezor make you use their wallet? So how would you use it in conjunction with Electrum? Also if i want to use multisig with my trezor how would i go about doing that? Because from my understanding i need to transfer all my Bitcoin to the Trazer wallet no? So how would it be used in conjunction with Electrum
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:53:30
do you have any suggestions? in canada and am a total noob to BTC and looking for something safe as I am pretty paranoid of being hacked or something. Looking into trazer for after i make the bulk of my intended purchase.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:08:09
yea coinsquare limit is so low i need to make a large purchase
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:18:39
so when i buy the trezor i have to use the trezor software to load the btc on the trezor and i will be able to choose a multisig option? And when i have 20 mill why is trezor not enough anymore? How could it be hacked?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:17:28
hey so i signed up with coinbase but my limit even with verified is 500. need like 30k in bitcoin over the next month, what are my options?
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:07:24
well i was told that for the best security i should be implementing multi sig along with trezor. I was originally under the impression that trezor alone was good enough for security for long term storage for my bitcoin but several redditors told me multi sig was necessary. I am new to bitcoin so just trying to do it right the first time im extremely paranoid of having my money compromised.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:56:36
is trazer a cold wallet? like what is the most fool proof way of storing large ammounts of BTC. i am looking to purchase 30k worth soon but eventually after i hold for 10 years who knows if thats worth a few mill i want to have an absolute fail safe way of guarding it so i can sleep at night. was thinking trazer
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:06:05
hey so I just ordered a trezor. I want to have multiple sig used in conjunction with trezor. I am a little confused as the multiple sigs are all me and in the tutorial it uses the example as if its multiple people. So would I just make multiple wallets in Electrum to simulate the 2/3 sig option?
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:57:14
really? so question. what is multisig? and say bitcoin goe to 100k in the future and my 5 or whatever is worth a lot, what is even more secure than trezor? And how could trezor not be enough considering it's cold storage? Genuinely curious as I am a total noob trying to educate myself. Thx for all the advice btw much appreciated!
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:44:59
what is multisig???
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:21:18
i honestly have no idea. just another layer of security. People on the trezor and btc subs are saying i need trezor + multi sig for enhanced security. I am just looking for the safest long term cold storage. Going to store some bitcoin for 5-10 years and in the hopeful chance it's worth millions one day I want to make sure I went through every possible precaution i could. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:45:13
lol i love your answer.
@_date: 2019-05-24 04:12:15
Did you even listen to the interview in question or just listen to whatever left wing rag told you to think? Of course you didn’t see it. You are a giant douche. No reasonable person in the world would listen to his interview and think he was advocating for pedophilia. You are a giant douche and the world is stupider for having listened to your drivel.
