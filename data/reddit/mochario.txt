What about the part where he lied to her, violated their agreement and snuck behind her back to use marital assets? With that level of trustworthiness and character, I wouldn't do business with someone like that, much less want a partnership with them.

Sounds like she left you because your level of character and integrity allowed you to secretly violate an agreement made between two partners about shared assets. Sneaking behind a partner's back to violate personal agreements and break your word as a man is a serious breach of trust, regardless of the vehicle you use to do it. If this lack of trustworthiness is a pattern, I can see how this would tip a partner over the edge. I'd seriously question my relationship if my partner demonstrated that lack of trustworthiness and inability to keep their word.

Most of us don't have to bribe our wives to stay, but I get why you have that agreement, we all do what we have to for companionship. Lucky you found someone who needs money that bad.

No, some women want a real man and no apology can turn you into one. You have to have real character for some of them. If he stole from his own wife, he's not a man. He can find a woman who doesn't care about honesty or manliness, just not the one he's married to.

Admittedly new to bitcoin, but I'm not seeing the trend you are. I bought some yesterday 12/22 and it's up over 30% today.
