People keep saying "its just 3,000" but that's all the money I had. I really wish I wasn't so stupid. I really just want to crawl up in a ball and cry.

I wish I would have been more of an active reader, or not had the money at the time, or just anything. I feel so bad and filled with so much anxiety I just cant understand why nothing works out for me.
I wasn't malicious, I wasn't abusing powers, I wasn't even making a lot of money. I worked so hard for that money and it's now it's all gone

I think this is exactly what happened.
account was probably hacked/ emails were changed/
but what I don't seem to understand is the fact that it took over a month for the ACTUAL paypal user to notice a charge in their paypal.

okay I'll do it now. Thanks I didnt realize I could stop any more from being withdrawn. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 09:53:04
How do I argue against that?

All 4 cases were opened and closed instantly(same day, or immediately after the ticket was opened)
I called and talked to 3 different paypal fraud agents with the same outcome. 
"We'll look into it sir, but we cannot help you at this point because digital currencies are not protected through out paypal buyer protection"
It makes me sick to my stomach. I haven't been able to sleep because I'm afraid I'm going to be implicated in something.
