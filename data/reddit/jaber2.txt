I bought at 7396, then saw it hitting 7100 during the weekend and bought more, every time it drops from 7396 I buy more

I see it on Gdax all the time, its not like one or two, today its like 10-20 each time
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:57:05
So if I bought at $0.03 and HODL it be worth $239? moral of the story is HODL
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:43:55
Agree, that is one big ugly fake brick wall

@_date: 2017-11-20 22:57:29
I thought I bought at high when it was $7348, few days later it dipped to $5500, I hold and baught
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:15:19
Don't sell and don't tell, just hold, ask again in 1 year when your $6000 investment would be worth allot more or nothing at all.
