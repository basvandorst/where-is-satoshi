But if I want to buy bitcoin to use online with the money that is in my bank account dont I have to buy the bitcoin to begin with using something like coinbase?

Fair enough. I guess I'm just frustrated how un-user friendly everything is. I spend hours trying to figure out the easiest way to do something but keep ending up down these convoluted rabbit holes. It's like there's millions of options to do every little thing and I get like paralysis by analysis or just too much information.
I can't seem to find a simple easy to understand for a beginner guide on how to do the most simple things from a trustworthy source.

What's the difference between coinbase, something like paxful, and something like localbitcoins?

I'm trying to purchase bitcoins with my debit card so I can send them directly to my poker account and was told to do it through coinbase.
Is there a faster option?
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:42:43
Oh ok, hopefully that's the case.
My impression was bitcoin was going to be instant. Like I was going to be able to pull money out of ACR, into bitcoin, then immediately into a different poker website, all through bitcoin, immediately.
Is this possible?

the the txid?
I honestly don't know I thought bitcoin was suppose to be super simple and quick now its just giving me a huge headache.

I deleted my post on coinbase. I need to leave this one up though because I have no idea what's going on. Worst case scenario they keep my $25 right?
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:38:39
Where would I find this txid?
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:25:14
Wtf really? I posted this exact message on coinbase community forum. The 2 sites I play on are legal and they both say they take bitcoin. Fuck. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:28:50
What would you recommend I use in the future?
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:38:00
Ok thanks. I posted the ID's in a reply to another poster right now

I have a transaction ID for the withdrawal from Americas Card Room (ACR) but on coinbase it shows no history of receiving it.

Thanks but I only use btc to move small sums of money online and where I want to deposit only accepts paypal soooo can you help me out?
@_date: 2018-06-13 04:50:25
I made a post earlier asking how to get my money from coinapult into paypal. A guy messaged me telling me how by using localbitcoins and to use a high rated user to do the transfer such as himself and linked me to his localbitcoins page which had a high rating. His username was the same as his localbitcoins name and he had a decently long post history commenting on subs like r/bitcoin and r/cryptopcurrency and seemed to know what he was talking about. I've been so frustrated trying to move this money to paypal that I was really just desperate for someone to guide me through each step and well I'm sure you can imagine how I got scammed from there.
Really stupid on my part, I got duped.
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:00:09
Haha perhaps. Definitely won't make the mistake again though. How is bitcoin like being your own bank?
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:18:13
True. What's your overall stance on BTC then?
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:01:21
You never said anything about scammers kinda irrelevant bro but glad youre happy
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:28:16
I'm sure you have good points but you just have a very r/iamverysmart vibe that's putting me off and making me not give a fuck about what you're saying.
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:02:28
Is this possible?
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:58:50
Yeah it sucks losing it but what sucks more is that it went into the hands of a scammer. Just scum. Anyways what's so great about bitcoin over banks anyways? Genuine question, I know there's a ton of benefits over banks, I just don't know them.
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:07:01
Look man I don't really know what the deal is with all this but I'm open to listening to what you have to say if you can just help me out with getting my money into paypal for the time being.
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:05:37
This was his username on reddit and this is the account he linked me to: 
Idk if he just copied that name though or if that's actually him. We did the transaction through reddit messages because I'm an idiot.
