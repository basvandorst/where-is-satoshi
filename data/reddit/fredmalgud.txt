Maybe they should ban all deceptive headlines while they are at it... Those silly Business Insider articles, for a start...

There are people who held dear to Blockbuster stock - they once seemed unbeatable not unlike Bitcoin.  But then new technology and business models allowed for the ascendance and now dominance of Netflix... Too early to tell if Bitcoin is Blockbuster or Netflix or something else.

...especially now that there are so many funds and institutional investors in Bitcoin.

...and don't put in what you can't afford - economically or mentally - to lose.  Suggest setting a percentage threshold of your net worth and sticking to it... That way, you manage yout own expectations if things blow up.

This makes Diamond's comments last week seem calculated and I am suspicious enough to wonder about market manipulation... This is crazy.  Any chance his comments were illegal?

My understanding is that coinbase will be supporting both currencies.  Is this accurate?
From their blog.
"Will a new asset be created following the fork?
Yes. The result of the fork will be two different blockchains, which means there will be two distinct digital assets.
What will Coinbase call these two blockchains?
Following the fork, we will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin with the symbol ‘BTC’.  We will refer to the new blockchain resulting from the fork as Bitcoin2x with the symbol ‘B2X’.
If the Segwit2x change is accepted by most users, we may choose to rename these blockchains at a later date."
