They take a one dollar transaction to verify your card. This is common. It’ll be 1.xx dollars and they ask you to fill in the cents part to make sure it’s your card. Ie by having you go into your bank statement.

��. My guess is 4900ish but who knows.
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:11:22
They’ve been doing this. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:06:13
Umm did it alter price to put bitfinex in a profitable position? Then yes.
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:14:17
Considering the manipulation that happened yesterday I don’t understand how anyone could think an ETF is even close. Bitfinex moved 100 million tethers to their exchange, waited for Bitmex to Close for maintenance, then blasted the market up to liquidate shorts. Bitfinex closed 10% of their shorts in one hour. The SEC isn’t touching this market until the manipulation stops and that only comes with more liquidity. Until then happy waiting.

100%. Maybe we get one in 2019
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:42:39
Use binance. You can do this. 
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:20:33
Just ran an illegal fractional reserve on an asset that supposed to be 1:1 backed by fiat that they can’t print at any time and use to manipulate the market. Nothing to see here!
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:23:39
Tom Lee says it’s going up. Tank confirmed.

NYAG shuts tether down. Then tether will drop itself.

We thank you for your sacrifice.

If you don’t own this book buy it. Amazing for noobs.
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:06:34
I wish more people understood this.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:39:01
It’s the best. Worth it
@_date: 2019-04-25 13:10:57
This guy gets it. The cycles are getting longer.
@_date: 2019-04-15 18:30:54
Sike. See you at 3k. ❤️
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:51:15
Haha. Keep dreaming. Crazy resistance plus this pump already fading. 
@_date: 2019-04-25 13:13:12
“Huge institutional demand” yet we are still in a bear market. Makes so much sense.
@_date: 2019-04-10 21:30:12
Someone lost money.
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:46:41
Can you learn what speculators are?
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:58:53
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:41:31
More speculators. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:26:14
Then once an ETF is introduced the people buying the ETF are speculating lol. It’s just a new crop of speculators. They won’t be using BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:07:08
Lol omg this is amazing
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:03:58
Which are speculation lol. None are adoption of tech
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:23:27
I’m pretty sure 4k is very far from zero so come back later bud.

For me to tell you the truth: free.
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:45:26
Quantum computing can’t beat the blockchain yet. We will have quantum proof signatures before it’s possible.
@_date: 2019-05-25 13:56:39
I want to buy this!
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:54:08
BTC replacing USD will never happen. It might be a reliable store of value though. The government will write laws long before they spend 42 billion (that’s how much it would cost) for a 51% attack that wouldn’t work. Your argument is not valid.
@_date: 2019-05-07 20:27:51
Remember when CNBC said we would pump on Consensus last year? Lulz
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:01:03
You’re talking about lame 51% attacks that the government would waste billions of dollars to do once. Literally once. Think about how dumb that is? 42 billion dollars to not even accomplish what you were trying to do? Simple logic...
@_date: 2018-12-02 04:51:29
Nah maybe 10k. Bear market is going to last a longggggg time.
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:58:21
Reread what I wrote bozo. I never said u thought BTC would replace usd. Readingz iz hardz.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:59:15
Chances are close to zero. Market still too immature. Find me in February for an I told ya so.
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:56:07
Are you incapable of using simple logic? 
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:13:11
Old article. Get your stats updated. Also bitmain is in China. Good luck
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:57:17
u/ObviousRecession this^
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:39:06
Nah market too young. Also not enough liquidity yet. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:51:14
Well they approved BTC being traded on the largest market in the world the CME so I think those days are over. That plus you only get to do a 51% attack one before the network adjusts. So it would be a waste of money.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:03:49
Also look what happened after lol.
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:47:26
Lol that’s not how it works. The government would never waste money on that. Also: 51% attacks never work that’s why they rarely happen. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:13:54
Nope. It’s not a threat. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:04:58
YOU CANNOT READ CLEARLY. 51% ATTACKS CAN ONLY BE ATTEMPTED ONCE. THE NETWORK ADJUSTS. PLUS YOU CANT EVEN GET THAT MUCH MINING EQUIPMENT. ITS IMPOSSIBLE. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:21:44
Nope not true once again. Because countries like Japan are embracing it. So unless every country on the planet united(which has slim odds) to ban it it’s not happening. People want the tech chase that comes with bitcoin and blockchain. You need to stop thinking like government has any power. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:49:48
Just like jsnip4
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:08:50
The hashing power is spread throughout the globe. The good ole USA will write laws before they use man power on anything like that. You’re conspiracy theorizing.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:57:43
Try for the next year plus bud.
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:05:49
Buy BTC. Everything else a question mark.
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:17:26
Even if it did once your lame 51% attack happens difficulty would adjust and other miners would take over. You’re never going to win this argument. For every mining pool that gets “taken over” it will only be eliminated from the network. This will open opportunity for new pools to spring up around the globe. Keep trying though
