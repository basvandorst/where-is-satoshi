Ahh, I kind of thought you were a massive dickhead, but thanks for confirming. I was pointing out that people open source as a security measure (or that this factors into the amalgam of reasons to open source a project) and not simply reducing it down to:

Well the argument can be made that BTC is still Fiat. You can't trade BTC back fro computing power so it is still based on trust. It has still enjoyed a large user base and an appraisal of real value in the market.

True, equities never experience rises or falls. Especially when the company is a new entrant and has a large amount of growth and regulatory uncertainty surrounding it. I don't think there is a precedent for a newly released currency to ever experience fluctuation as it is being widely adopted. Precious metals never fluctuate either. It is almost like supply, demand, and market-friction have no effect in markets, especially those that are imperfect. Totally weird, right?
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:10:24
I get your point but I think a lot of the OS of BTC was just to prove that the code is in the public domain, is secure, and is not governed by a central authority. Not so people can make dodge coin.
@_date: 2014-01-23 01:00:14
you can buy them in person using local bitcoin or a similar service. It depends where you are. I have found a massive amount of friction as well and am hoping someone more knowledgeable steps in and talks about good ways to purchase BTC.
As an aside I have heard coinbase makes you wait a long time until you use the service a significant amount. You can not execute instant transactions and also it limits the am't you can purchase at a time. I have heard this, want to hear it confirmed.
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:12:12
True. I just came here from an article that says surely a celebrity will make their own coin in 2014. Also, the website with a few forms to full in to make your own coin is not helping.

it is super ironic as well. It was started as a crypto company to do IR transfers between phones. Elon has even said that there are bugs left in the code and a white-board of suggestions he left in the office after the acquisition that have never been implemented or attempted. He is disappointed in the company's progress, and they should be too; if not from an intellectual standpoint, at least from a fucking economics standpoint.

There are third party escrow protocols in BTC. I am not really the guy to explain this from a technical level but these features are built in. You will see market makers and 3rd party escrow services arise to facilitate transfer of goods and services and be arbitrators in buyer/seller conflicts.

To be fair, I was working off the link from the forbes article that I have posted the link 2 in several posts ITT.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:02:43
Not at all. I am considering buying into LTC at present as it seems logical. With any disruptive technology there are always other entities to move into the space. I couldn't imagine bitcoin being the only currency. Why would it? It is a great currency but it is over valued. It is also a great idea. LTC would not detract from BTC at all but would certainly allow for more diversification. Especially because this tech represents a fundamental paradigm shift in global banking. The emergence of this kind of currency is still in the beta stage. There are concentration issues. Someone with a large enough wallet can move the market and control the currency. If there were 5 currencies it would be 5x harder (or proportionately depending on valuations across currencies to limit arbitrage) to control. I was looking to find out 2 things 1) if LTC is tied to BTC in a way other than code &amp; 2) If there were inherent problems with LTC other than adoption.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:44:00
I have also read those articles. LTC is often priced in BTC. I am curious if LTC can appreciate relative to BTC. It seems like it trades more like BTC are dollars and LTC are cents. As is they are just nominally different but offshoots o the same currency.
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:30:19
Me too. Seems there are a lot in development but nothing has come to market.

This guy is all over the place with the same post and similar posts are cropping up from random newly made accounts on reddit. HOWEVER, given the amount of attention payed to Topiary and Levinson and other people who are doing anti-government things, I find it odd (not impossible obviously) that this isn't being more widely covered. 
To be clear, I am not saying that the "Ulbricht was never arrested conspiracy" is viable. I AM saying, that what we are being fed in the media is likely intentional lies or unfounded speculation by a few journalists like Chen who quote each other in circular reporting.

I will look into this. A cursory investigation indicates they are allowing a 25K investment in their Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) for accredited investors only (falling within the paradigm discussed above). Further, this fund looks to be a hedge or participation in returns from value added by BTC. It is a structured investment vehicle and it seems to add value by allowing a large purchase of BTC as part of a fund instead of through an exchange. I am interested in crowdsourced BTC for equity. I will look further though. Cheers.

I looked quick, thought it was just encrypt hash. What are you meaning to say, that this outflow went to PExpress?

The link I am talking about is the link I posted. I am OP. Go to the top, click the link in title and then go to transactions. If you look at recent transactions it says -36000 BTC.

@_date: 2013-10-24 21:57:15
I think it is fair to consider that there are only a few possible scenarios:
1. DPR is Ross, was caught by FBI, SR siezed
2. Ross is an employee, was outed to FBI or scapegoated by other members who have seized the wallet
3. SR is a government construct, BTC is pure
4. BTC is a construct, SR is Pure
5. Both are constructs
6. Combo. or Other

Fair point. However, I think torture is nothing to the government. Also, they want this currency to do the things listed above. They could cut a deal, torture, coerce, or maybe crack the PW. Who knows, but if I was the US (working closely with the private Inc. Fed Reserve) I would try to control as much of this currency as possible to exert some measure of control. 
Wonder what kind of hash-rate they will get out of that new Utah facility they are building.
@_date: 2013-10-25 02:02:46
This is alleged by forbes to be connected. I obviously didn't do primary research on the subject. Their expert purports that this wallet is affiliated with either altoid or SR or DPR.

To be clear, I linked that post but do not believe that part of the story (or most of his allegations TBH). I do think the photo of Ross was super photoshopped though, it looks really weird. Not claiming that people don't us photoshop on their own, or anything wild. I am saying it does look photoshopped.
@_date: 2013-10-24 23:17:45
Once again PURE SPECULATION, but torture and NSA crypto-capabilites have been working well so far in other arenas...
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:42:53
There are a lot of odd things going on (which is why I referenced that conspiracy thread) like the photoshop, and people having missing money, and SR Vendors possibly being Admins and scamming. Not sure what is true and what isn't.
If we assume it is true that someone really tried to blackmail Ulbricht, and provided proof that they had lists and logs of customers there are only a few real options: 1)Assumption wrong, this was an outright lie 2)A outside hacker gained info on SR 3) An insider used inside info to blackmail ross 4)NSA/FBI found Ross and the SR server but not the forums/didn't take down the forums.
No outcome is great. Most likely a combo of 3 and 4 escaping in fallout.

Look, I am not making any claims. I am just pointing out none of your answers are adequate in explaining away what happened. There are many questions, very few answers. Why does the picture of Ross that circulates look to have a fully saturated black mouth and appear to be altered. I am not even remotely acting like I know what is going on, but I wanted to get a general feeling from the BTC community.

Obviously there are problems with most major sovereign currencies but that didn't stop people from creating others. The point is, there is also no reason not to adopt LTC. Having several crypto currencies to diversify across makes the most sense. Especially because it would be more difficult to control them by buying in.
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:40:25
Still hasn't come to market. Also, as said, it seems like a great technical feat to overcome if they want to deliver this product as specified. Obviously, super interested but it seems like there has been no communication since the Bitcoin conference in May. Not hearing from a start-up for 5 months, especially in a small community like BTC, is a huge red flag.

@_date: 2013-10-25 01:17:25
HAHAHA fair. The conspiracy nonsense started when I linked to some absurd speculator. My point, which was never made, was basically that SR was likely run by a team. It is possible to entertain the theory that either with inside sources or speculation, someone ascertained that it was 0 hour. They sold out Ulbricht, robbed some of the accounts in the confusion, moved, took the code and are setting up one(or more) of the next iterations as a scam/ponzi to rinse and repeat. I think something like this is just worth ENTERTAINING, and does not make me a lunatic.
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:28:54
I don't want to get too deep into conjecture/conspiracy/speculation especially with a very limited picture(as everyone) of what is going on. I feel like what could have happened is that SR, as run by a team of people had some sort of disagreement. It could be that they were scamming and Ross was against it, or that they were just straight up extorting him. To have that kind of info (and provide proof as alleged) they had to have access to the server. Vis a Vis they could have manufactured the "evidence" that he was soliciting hits, they could have simultaneously lead him on to need to solicit a hit, or they could have collaborated with FBI/LEO. In any event, this information did end up in LEO hands. 
Then, as the 0 hour was coming. I think someone snatched a bunch of BTC and then fled in the chaos. Likely to restart a new scam SR. The control of the SR Forum, being one way to mitigate the online chatter about the fallout as people naturally gravitate towards it to explain what happened.
Who the fuck knows.

I personally do not allege that. However, this one document has been thrown around the web and there have not been too many other corroborating documents to be fair. Especially after senators call for the closure of the sight, but then are silent on the matter afterwards.

@_date: 2013-12-23 07:51:20
Yeah try to spot if he is a sociopath. They have metered patterns of breaking eye contact. They have to do it regularly because they don't get social cues (like feeling really awkward about staring too long). I don't actually think he is a sociopath though because he would have just turned everyone in under him and gone free. I would imagine that they offered him some shit like that. 
The whole thing seems really weird to me though. Interested to know more. I was up in SF recently, I thought the drug scene would be more open. Anyway, interested to see what happens. Things are boring in LA without SR.

@_date: 2013-10-24 23:33:38
Fairplay. I am making that claim. Something IS going on here. I do not claim to know what, but I suspect over the next 6 months it will be evident that the FBI didn't just use "good old fashioned police work" to catch DPR because of some posts someone called Ross Ulbricht made on a few websites.
I just want to point out that the climate on the internet has turned pretty nasty. Assange is locked in the embassy, Snowden is in exile for outing a MASSIVE set of NSA programs capable of spying on world leaders, Levinson had to SHUT DOWN a company he built organically. You have 17 y/o kids like Topiary and other hackers being persecuted for basically being smart and good with computers, but being unrecruitable/anti-establishment. The climate is very nasty. These things eat news cycles. Yet an 80 Mil black market that had a shrouded leader taunting the senate for a few years and also trying to order several execution style hits on a few people extorting him has limited play? If the story is exactly how it has been reported, it would be insanely interesting and should get a bit more coverage. There just ISN'T enough information to keep reporting on it. That was the point of the post. To put out a seemingly connected event (citing a source (forbes.com)) and see what people thought. Then build to what the community thinks is going on. Which it seems, is virtually nothing but what a journalist summarized from that one charges summary, and the fact that the SR actually was shut down. These are the actual facts:
* Ross Ulbricht was arrested
* A seizure notice appeared on the SR website.
* A charges summary was found on a website.
* Others have been arrested in alleged connection to the site.
Beyond this almost everything is speculation.
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:55:43
I don't know why everyone is harping on about this photo. I think it looks weird, it does look weird, and it is awkward as hell. That is all. Obviously anyone can shop a photo, it could be not photoshopped, it doesn't matter. It doesn't mean anything. I simply think it looks weird.

Once again, I am obviously not privvy to any special knowledge, BUT not only is 17 million a pretty good amount of money, it is anonymous crypto-currency that can be used for anything. Especially setting up another honey-pot SR, or to pay informants, or to use to set up dealers, or to just be stolen by someone corrupt.
@_date: 2013-10-24 22:35:07
Some of it seems absurd. Although I am very much attuned to the "The bigger the lie, the easier the sell" philosophy, it would be obvious pretty quickly if he wasn't actually in jail. As referenced above there is a FBI charge summary that is out there. I don't know where it came from, but again, there is no reason to think it isn't legit. 
However, for someone who is allegedly as intelligent as Ross the person was (UPenn grad on Scholarship with 2 degrees) the mistakes seem pretty fucking dumb. Also, it seems like there is actually a network of admins who were running the site, so not a one man op by any means. Could be parallel construction, could be a honeypot, or it could have been actually infiltrated on an organizational level by the Feds. Super unclear. 
Final thoughts, I find it difficult to believe one person started the site, and Ross bought it, took it to scale organically, and then was arrested. It seems like the forbes and gawker articles lent a lot of credibility to the site and then there was a massive failure mode. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:20:47
I prob. should not have linked that post. It was intriguing to read but OBVIOUSLY written by someone who had an agenda (butthurt at SR, trolling, on drugs). I think the far more likely scenario is an inside set up, like proposed to below. Someone on the team, with a disagreement with ross started arguing. Then either by trolling him or using his credentials they layed out a path of breadcrumbs. Burned him, and took some of the money in the ensuing chaos. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 07:22:26
I wish they would. It was an exchange, i thought maybe there was a product link somewhere given the context of my post. NOPE.

I like that BTC is anonymous, and having a safe place to store BTC is imperative to the growth of the currency (as it is to any currency). However, I like a degree of anonymity and a phone, the data, and all of the MAC and IP addresses are on file. It would be a lot cooler to have a cheap dedicated device that could execute payments to stores or person to person over wired connection.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:33:34
Thanks mate sounds awesome. I really want to retain my BTC. I am thinking about using OKPay. Don't know much about it. I am trying to use my Bank Account to fund a payment to BTC-E. If you have any suggestions that would be awesome. if not I will update in a week or so on here if anyone cares,.

This forbes [article]( lists:


“Given that the [$17-million wallet] has the largest amount of bitcoins in any one address (and has for a while), people are always going to be eager to try to unmask its owner,” she said by email. “But I seriously doubt any type of blockchain analysis could do this definitively (unless it eventually spends its bitcoins; that’s a different story entirely!).”
She was also able to link the altoid address to another wallet containing over [23,000 Bitcoin.]( 
obviously, since the article, there have been transactions made. on the account. It looked as if 4 days ago the account sent approx. 7 million USD out of the account. That was my question/link in the original article.
Edit: The outflow was 36,000 BTC, as indicated in the transactions.

They have a top analysts board on their website, it links the best hacks of the week. Analysts compete to hack high-profile clandestine targets, then they post about how they have infiltrated these covert targets on their message boards, often they do peer reviewed studies publishing their exact methods, proof of concept, and their entire capabilities (updated daily) so that other hackers in the private sector can play along.

I don;t have an agenda. I am just interested in what is happening and obviously distrust the media, I wanted to see what the community had to say. The address I linked was from the Forbes article that had outflows going to the SR account. Even though BTC is growing a 7 Million dollar move is large and not ordinary. I find it odd that the SR forum is still up. Admins claiming they are going to put up SR 2 and 3.0. This seems like a good way to lend credibility to something that otherwise wouldn't be. 
Similarly, SR was more than a drugs bust. It was a market maker that allowed all sorts of undesirable (to the gov't) goods to be transferred. I want to believe the seizure was a good thing, because now new and improved sites (many more than one) will take the place of SR and diversify the risk. However, I still have questions that are unanswered: Why is no one talking, why is the forum up, what happened with Atlantis, who is moving all of this currency around, and why was the SR Camel superimposed on the GODDAMN seizure notice. /rant
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:47:22
Well if we can trust some simple facts from the news (maybe we can't) he had an advert up for a VC backed BTC start-up. Indicating likely involvement of other individuals. Also, although I am not a programmer, even a cursory knowledge of programming &amp; biz would suggest that to manage a Tor HS, patch any security threat out (as world Gov is hunting you) AND manage a multi-million dollar business and the databases of info is not a 1 person job. It would be like running Paypal in the early days. To reach critical mass X.com merged with Confinity. But now imagine if you can't sell to ebay so you either chance organic growth until you get caught (splitting profits as you go forward), dump the site (losing the value you created), or frame your partner throw off the heat and excape with the lion share of the profits to rinse and repeat.
