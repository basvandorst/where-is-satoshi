Did you check out the rates? What were the fees?
@_date: 2019-03-11 13:20:08
Thanks for saving me the time.
Edit: I read it anyway :)

Some of your points are uncomfortably true, but this one is not. Losing 3% of $50 when all you have is $50 definitely hurts worse than losing 3% of $50,000,000. In one case you'd still have $48,500,000, in the other, you could barely buy food for a week.

It's a military term.

That makes no sense. Why would someone pay to mine an asteroid of gold if gold was worth nothing?

Well, it has been synthesized, but it costs millions of dollars to make a few ATOMS of gold. Yes, atoms. You don't need to worry about your gold becoming obsolete any time soon.

Also, the last gold confiscation was one of the least followed and least prosecuted laws in American history. So even when they did, they didn't.

I unsubbed from r/btc are they talking about this on there?
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:12:44
I am indeed!

The vid is from 2014....she was early!

Do you know any stories like that? I'd like to read them if you have links.

The congressman from Ohio that responded directly afterward with the Billy Madison quote was pretty cool.

Satoshi's response to this was:
 " If you do, I think it should be a very brief, single paragraph article like 100 words or less that simply identifies what Bitcoin is.  
I wish rather than deleting the article, they put a length restriction.  If something is not famous enough, there could at least be a stub article identifying what it is.  I often come across annoying red links of things that Wiki ought to at least have heard of.  
The article could be as simple as something like:  
"Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer decentralised /link/electronic currency/link/."  
The more standard Wiki thing to do is that we should have a paragraph in one of the more general categories that we are an instance of, like Electronic Currency or Electronic Cash.  We can probably establish a paragraph there.  Again, keep it short.  Just identifying what it is."

My exact thoughts as i'm reading through all his posts on that forum. Though i got into it long after the legend had already turned to myth.
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:54:47
Literally directly after Sherman.

 " So I don't understand why we don't have more inflation if we've been printing money for so long. "
The last few rounds of QE has been given to the banks, but held by the Federal Reserve. It's not out in the money supply. There are tighter rules about about fractional reserve lending which keeps the money from being dumped into the economy. So the money was given to the banks to bail them out, but for a lot of it, they can't touch it. I can't go into much more detail than that because i'm not an expert, but i had been wondering the same thing for many years, until finally i found an economist to ask.

Confused too. I watched the other video, and learned about the copper market and had to go back to make sure i wasn't in r/copperbugs (which, evidently is a thing)
