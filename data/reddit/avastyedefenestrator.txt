Good points but going with this apples-to-oranges comparison, I would think that it is a little unfair comparing a proof-of-work with a banks 'imperative' system, because in the banks' case this is only a small part of how they support their security infrastructure. 
In bitcoin, security is provided as part of the transaction system, whereas in a bank a huge expensive security system is built around a simple enough transactional system. This security system could be seen as everything from the teller at the window who checks your ID, to the security processes that new customers undertake, to the security systems around online banking websites, even down to the guards who monitor the gold in the vaults etc. Banking 'security' couldn't exist without all this and so it must be included in any (although very imprecise) comparison of bank vs btc costs.
