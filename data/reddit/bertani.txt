Great hackathon so far!
At [iudex]( we are creating a smart contract providing a reputation index/score for your web identity - something similar to what bitrated/keybase/onename already do, but in a totally transparent and decentralized way - the connection w/ external accounts (reddit/linkedin/twitter/..) is possible thanks to the [Oraclize API](
You can then easily use this scores from other smart contracts to handle some logic, example: an automated escrow contract for trading BTC and ETH could automatically unlock certain ETH once the associated BTC deposit has received N confirmations where N depends on the reputation index of the given counterparty.

Correct, that flaw was himself - before leaving.

Bitboat fees are 4% and includes live chat support in the local language, escrow service and automation tools (integration with the payment methods supported by the platform). As already said the price on the website is final, including all fees, not just the platform one but the sellers one too. So it doesn't make any sense to compare it to 1% or 5% of localbitcoins, you should add the seller margin too.
The price on bitboat is final and is already including all fees.
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:33:13
Bitboat is not a regular exchange but a platform providing escrow service and automation tools to private buyers/sellers willing to sell via 'cash deposits' so the fee is absolutely reasonable. You should compare it with the ones on localbitcoins or bitcointalk private ad ;) Please note that the price includes both the service fee and the vendors margin.
@_date: 2015-08-24 20:56:40
4% is bitboat fee for all the services it provides, all the rest is the margin for the vendors so feel free to do your math. It seems like you don't know a lot about the specific markets we are talking about (Italy, France and Spain): Bitboat is aligned to the % these markets are used to. 10% total margin (4% bboat, 6% vendor) is the one for 'bitcoin to cash' (which is the topic of this reddit conversation), 'cash to bitcoin' is a little bit higher but depends on the payment method.
0% to 5% is not anywhere near the average margin for the sellers accepting 'cash deposits' in the listed countries.
Please note that Bitboat gives access to Bitcoin ('cash to bitcoins') from 80k+ reselling points in Italy and several thousands in France and Spain too.
@_date: 2015-08-14 18:16:45
Actually  is the first exchange of this type still operating in Italy. It's already the leading 'cash to bitcoin' instant exchange both in Italy and France and it's expanding to other countries (Spain, Greece, etc.).
Coinbit and all the others just copied bitboat after the success of Bitboat-model in Italy.
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:54:04
While Italy just got 6k via bitboat.net/atm ;)

[Oraclize]( is using TLSNotary as well to prove its honesty, the idea is pretty much the same I used here (providing that a specific server at a given time gave a certain content as response, with no manipolation by third parties)
@_date: 2016-02-04 14:55:28
This was fixed now, I have attached a TLSNotary proof via IPFS, you can check it with [pagesigner]( if you want to see the original response.
@_date: 2016-02-06 10:24:14
And [here]( is the [IPFS]( link. Stop this, if you can.
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:13:07
It's not just that, Oraclize lets you create contracts using these data too. For example you could create a contract to automatically send bitcoin to a third-party as soon as your litecoin/whatever address receives the correct amount from him, acting as an automated escrow. Practically you can create "any" type of contract which is based on conditions verifiable online.
Oraclize takes care of providing the 2nd signature to your partially signed transaction (signed by you with 1 of the 3 keys of the 2-of-3 multisig wallet before your event occurs and by the private key of oraclize when the event is verified), then it automatically broadcasts the fully signed transaction.
@_date: 2015-04-02 22:37:58
The contract service is centralized in the sense that you are relying on one oracle only. If there were other oracles (supporting such a wide range of conditions) than we would be able to develop together and provide a decent inter-oracles API. Unfortunately this is not the case at the moment. What I am talking about is what the Orisi project was trying to achieve, we are working to get the Orisi project back on track but cooperation with other potential oracles is crucial.
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:05:44
It's coming soon, we are already working on it
@_date: 2015-09-21 19:56:40
This is what oraclize.it is for. Linking on-chain smart contracts with off-chain data-feeds from the Internet.
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:27:15
Yes, I think Oracles can help smart contracts being really useful. Anyway I am the founder of Oraclize so I am already putting my money where my mouth is ;)
@_date: 2015-10-12 11:57:34
The user doesn't need to signup, but we do some verifications on his phone number in order to be AML compliant, so this is not 100% anonymous.

The website is right, you cannot put coins it, but the ATM can give you coins out. Look, I don't really see what we are talking about here, it's you who did not test it already, our customers is paying the exact amount and we did our homework too. To clarify this again, you can specify an amount such as 9.84 eur, put in a 10 eur banknote (coins not accepted, as you pointed out) and the ATM will give you the 0.16 eur change back (with coins, yes).
@_date: 2015-10-13 09:57:52
Depending on where you are located [biboat.net]( might be the right website for you (available in Italy, France, Spain). Once the payment is done (it works with cash deposits) the bitcoins are sent to you within 5 minutes.
@_date: 2015-10-28 12:10:29
or more simply, Ethereum
@_date: 2015-10-13 09:58:38
Which you probably don't.
@_date: 2015-10-19 06:16:36
Just noticed the thread, we would like to thank the OP to test our service, thanks for the great feedback.
However what the OP is writing about price and fees is NOT true at all.
Our total commission is Spain is 9% (over average market price) while he is claiming that our price was almost 13% over the avg market price! I guess you could check that by yourself by browsing our price chart and the ticker on the bitboat website.
Just for being more transparent, our 9% commission includes 5% fee to the bitboat vendor (providing the btc and bank account) + 4% fee for our service (automation tools for vendors, antifraud, live local language support, accounting, escrow, etc) so if you want to compare with other exchanges (even with localbtc, which takes 1% fee for escrow only) you should add to their price their fees too or your comparison would be pointless.
Thanks for trying our service anyway
@_date: 2015-10-01 07:33:54
You can have a look at some stats here: 
@_date: 2015-10-19 06:21:52
see my answer above please ;)
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:13:12
What are you talking about? The logic of our service in Spain was tested for weeks and is similar to the one already used by many Spanish sellers indeed.
@_date: 2015-10-19 11:36:05
We are transparent as we are including all our fees in the final price, the 9% fee I am talking about can vary in the future as we always try keeping our price the lower level we can afford, we are just granting our price is inclusive of all fees. For me this means being very transparent, even the bitcoin.de price you are talking about doesn't include fees. 
Anyway I don't see how bitcoin.de price is meaningful in any way for our purposes, they volumes are very low hence price is not that relevant. Why should we base our price on bitcoin.de? Anyway your post said "220, max 225" while what you are showing here is "225 on a website with low volume"..
I don't think there is much else to say here, anyway I really appreciate you trying our service and giving us feedback.
Trying to provide a better service is always possible and this is what we are focused on lately, so thank you for you feedback!
@_date: 2015-10-19 09:11:31
Your order was placed at 9:02am UTC on the 16/10/15, we take an last24volume-weighted average price of the 3rd major exchanges of the world, converting then the price back to EUR with the actual rate, as I already said we then include in the final price our total premium which is 9% (4% on our side, 5% on seller side for Spain).
You said above "when on other exchanges was 220 or 225 max", this is lying because it's simply not true. It's not wathever price you see on mycelium/bitcoin.de/localbitcoins which is doing the actual price, but the one on exchanges with real volume.
Again, I don't have anything against you, but you keep showing wrong numbers and facts. In fact at the time your placed the order the price was ~3% above "your" stated 220, so even over your "max 225". So this is exactly the 9% I told you.. while your post showed our fee was ~13%.
For instance at the time you placed the order the price on bitstamp was ~259 USD, which is ~228.20 eur. 228.20*1.09= 248.74 eur, ta dah!
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:47:34
The ones listed on our map mostly does ;) 
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:33:53
I have nothing against you too, I am just saying you are wrong since we have tried in person (at ATM) and our customers did it too (at ATM). I can ensure you 100% it's working like I am saying, please just try instead of keeping to say the opposite.
Once again, ATMs are not accepting coins but are giving coins back as change (coins are provided to the ATM by the bank).
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:23:56
A foreign Spanish speaker did the translation for us, we are still fixing some minor errors thanks to feedbacks from native speakers, anyway your contribution would be very appreciated.
@_date: 2015-10-12 11:59:04
Not really, the only ATM cash deposit we are supporting is the Spanish BBVA one, which is able to give you the change (yep, even with coins) . Since we don't have other ways to identify some deposits we are choosing unique amounts to be paid for each order, this is the reason why the user cannot choose the eur amount but the btc one only! We handled tens of thousands of orders so far so trust me it's working ;)
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:41:14
Did you even try? Talk is cheap uh. Try to go to a BBVA ATM, deposit cash to a bank account, you input the amount specifying the exact amount, you then put the cash in and get the chance cash/coins out.
Tens of thousands of orders was referred to Italy/France were we are active since 2013/2014 respectively. We opened our service to Spain just few months ago and we had some hundreds of orders so far.
@_date: 2015-10-19 06:23:52
We do have more than one bitcointalk thread with tons of feedbacks, other than this even google is filled with articles talking about us and showing feedbacks! Anyway we have figured out most of our customers do not use reddit or bitcointalk so it didn't make sense to link this websites to them. We have both twitter and facebook pages as well, you can find some feedbacks here too.
Other than this you can checkout out the "team" page + linkedin + google, which are usually good tools to check if there are scammers on the way or not. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 11:01:16
Founder/CEO of the project here.
All the payment methods we are supporting let you buy Bitcoin almost instantly by cash, we are the leading 'cash to bitcoin' exchange in Italy and France and we are expanding in other european countries as well.
We are not selling Bitcoin directly, the liquidity is provided by some private vendors, we are very similar to localbitcoin indeed! The difference is that we support 'cash deposits' only and by having a stronger integration with vendors (we check in real-times if each payment is received) we can automate the whole process and act as escrow.
All the prices include both our fees and the ones of vendors (other than the ones of the payment method itself).
In fact we are providing easy access to Bitcoin from hundreds of thousands of tobacco stores/shops in Italy, France, Spain with no need to have a bank account, you just need some cash other than Internet access of course ;)

The prices the OP is pointing out are completely wrong as you can verify by yourself.
Our total fees are 9% compared to avg market price, this includes 4% fee on our side (for having automation process and many other services other exchanges are NOT providing) and 5% profit for the vendor (the one providing the btc and bank account).
Note that we are already including all our fees in the price, while localbtc is not (essentially because the escrow on their platform is optional, while on our is mandatory).
@_date: 2015-10-28 12:09:45
In fact this looks more like an ethereum address, probably on a private blockchain..  
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:42:29
Really? Tell to the hundreds of users who already paid us in this way. We made some tests too, but did you?
BBVA ATM in Spain can give you change, even coins.
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:46:24
I have been working for the last few months on a project meant to address this shortage and I have completed a full-rounded oracle service, much less restrictive than all the "alternatives" that are currently available. I am releasing it in few days so.. stay tuned ;)
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:38:45
Unique reference is not there with all payment methods, with instant deposits of cash you get the money in your account but need some hours/days to see them listed.
