I have been told that Segwit address should save transaction fees.
I am using the Ledger Nano S and trying to send bitcoin from different wallet, as you can see the Segwit address fee is much higher please see the attached screenshot.
Could someone please explain that?

you can put any amount of bitcoin in the input field to get an idea of transaction fees. I put 1 bitcoin doesn't mean I have 1 bitcoin in my wallet. just to clarify

Multi-signature address I think. Signed with both parties.

Your card looks awesome ! Yes please create segwit address to help everyone.

I think you are right! We should get coins off just in case if it happens. Store into our own wallet is much safer.

I can’t agree more ! Thanks for sharing. But Is it an old interview ? He said one bitcoin would be $6000 in 2018...
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:31:35
I noticed it as well!

I don’t recommend Bitcoins to others because if everyone knows how bitcoin works I don’t have a chance to buy more! Be wise please!

Please stop doing this! My money is still on the way to exchange. Price has gone up! $8600

Female. Software developer. I have bitcoins :)
(I understand how hash function works, encryption/decryption, distribution system. I have been coding for 9 years and I did forex trading for one year. I think bitcoin is gold 2.0 , other cryptos serve different purpose and blockchain will change lots of industries in 2018 +, we will see a lot of dApps in the future, I am bullish ! )
