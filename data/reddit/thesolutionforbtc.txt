Unlimited will centralize Bitcoin under a few people.
SegWit will keep Bitcoin decentralized.
If Unlimited would like decentralization they whould accept first SegWit and after increase the blocks, but Unlimited dont want SegWit they want to be the Leader. The problem for them is that the community dont like them...so they make a huge campagne about Unlimited and spam the network with small Tx's.
Ask yourself why these few people behind Unlimited dont create a new Blockchain with the rules of Unlimited? 
Why do they want Bitcoin to **Hard Fork**?
Why they dont support SegWit a **Soft Fork** first which is tested enough, and want Unlimited which is a **Hard Fork**?
Its simple people just want to be always the Leader/King of something that is big/successful such as Bitcoin. It was always the same in Human History!

The Solution for Bitcoin without soft or hardfork!
All of us (users,companies, etc.) who are using Bitcoin for different reasons (investment, gambling, faucets etc) can help to increase the Transactions more than 2,5 times (we could help to bring the transactions up to about 637000 Txs/24h instead of about 250000 Txs/24h today).
How is this possible?
As we know each Transaction has a size of 226 bytes if it has 1 Input, so if all of us who use Bitcoin for different reasons will start to use each Bitcoin address to receive only 1 Transaction the network with 1 MB could handle ( up to 637000 Txs per Day without problem and low fees). Its more than 2,5 times. ALSO we whould pay less fees as each Tx whould have only 226 bytes!
We whould have 2 inputs or more only if the amount which is wanted to be used is higher than the amount of an adress. A Bitcoin user could also use a software which whould handle all his addresses and spent from that address that has the required amount (choosing that one with the highest value and the return whould be sent to a NEW as always address).
*If you look at the Txs which are recorded on the Bitcoin Blockchain there are many of them who are over 1000 bytes because they have more than 1 input.
You can see that we can safe a lot of capacity on the Blockchain if we just use more bitcoin addresses (for each income/input Transaction just use a NEW Bitcoin address)

I told you 3 days ago that it was a good time to BUY!!!
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:03:09
Who is the noob now? You said Bitcoin will dump under 1000$, but i see Bitcoin is going up (its gaining more than 20$ as you said yesterday)
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:54:14
Yes but that isnt enough! 
You dont have to use any coinjoin, Bitcoin users have to change how they use the Bitcoin adresses as described above! There are many of us who use 1 Bitcoin address to receive more than 1 Tx. If we change this and only receive 1Tx for each Bitcoin address, the current problem is solved)
Each of us can help the Bitcoin network easily to handle more Txs!
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:41:12
Dont use bitcoinfees.21.co/ they are not correct!
Use  they are showing that more than 60 satoshi/byte is enough!
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:03:15
I dont agree as you forget that there are NEW records on  which are not all off chain txs
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:13:13
I think both, spammers and people who are buying back Bitcoin as they see now that Core wins and there will be no Hard fork!

The minimum fee whould be the shown on the website to get into the next block. But its better to increase that as the fees are increasing till the next block is mined.

It looks to me like  is also manipulating the fee structure, they still recomend to high fees but the real one is much lower as you can see here

But if people use bitcoinfees.21.co/ to pay their fees, they are pushing the fees going up without reason as the mempool ist right now almost empty!
People have to use realtime/LIVE FEE/SIZE data like that from **
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:51:57
After the announcement of the exchanges there was a panic sell as People thought the Hardfork is coming in the next days...Now we are going back to reality!

**Bitcoin Difficulty is rising so everything is fine!**
Estimated Next Difficulty: about +4.00%
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:52:07
U are the noob, so lets see! The conclusion is already there! Core wins!
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:17:08
You forget that the Bitcoin Difficulty is still rising. Estimated Next Difficulty: +4%.   So the price will go up as miners will get less Bitcoins after the increase.
Dont forget this!
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:12:16
I disagree! New people who bought in the last6 months are scared so they sell, but if you know how the network works you dont! 
Bitcoin will be used as a store of value like Gold 2.0 thats all! Let Bitcoin alone and dont change the rules of the Blockchain, Bitcoin will find its own way!
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:46:28
maybe yes i dont realy know, but many people are using them so we have to inform people that they are not LIVE/real.
**Use**  to see the real and live Fee/size.

**Good JOB!!!**
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:56:44
I agree, but the community supporting Core/SegWit is much bigger than Antpool or Roger - if they dont like the rules of Bitcoin why they dont create their own NEW Altcoin? Now you see that Bitcoin is really Decentralized and not controled by anyone! This is why Bitcoin was created.

Ponzi Scheme. DONT invest!!! you will lose your money
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:29:17
I think you was wrong! Core wins... In the last 24 hours 34% of blocks have the BU signal. But better look at Last 1000 blocks not last 144blocks (24hrs).
Just look at

Dont use bitcoinfees.21.co/ they are not correct!
Use  they are showing that more than 60 satoshi/byte is enough!
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:25:34
People used Bitcoin also years ago when the price was lower than 1000$. Why is this a problem? Longterm the price will go up thats why we have the Halvening! Bitcoin will never be useless! Thats why we have the 21M limit and the halvening every 4 years!
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:48:48
I cant tell you when will it next drop...this is something nobody knows! But right now Bitcoin reached its normal/real price. Its not expensive and not cheap (it was cheap 3-4 days before as i told you to buy). Right now its the real value/price based to the Estimated Next Difficulty.
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:53:10
Are you kidding me? The  Estimated Next Difficulty is also based on maths!
@_date: 2017-03-24 08:38:53
Even 11% is too low!
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:42:47
Because you just look at the price...you dont look at the stats which Bitcoin is based on...like mining difficulty. You said Bitcoin to go to 700/600$, if you understood how Bitcoin works really you whouldnt say that.
I just wannt people to understand how Bitcoin realy works! Its based on mathematics and not on Emotions like many of you
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:16:23
Just go and look at  and check also the stats and information here   
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:41:05
The difficulty adjust about every 14 days. The amount of Bitcoin mined is the same till the next Halving! 
But if the difficulty increase each miner will get less Bitcoin of the total amount which is mined every 10 min!
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:45:27
Misinformaition shown on  are pushing the fees higher, as users are paying high fees without reason!
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:41:23
Yes thats why i made this post! 
Is bitcoinfees.21.co becoming blockchain.info Nr.2 ???
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:17:10
but there are a lot of users out there who doesnt know this, and use one Bitcoin addresse for many inputs instead of creating a new bitcoin adress.
Of course it's not possible if the amount we want to send is bigger than the inputs, but that is not always the case. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:25:40
I told you 3 days ago that it was a good time to BUY!!!
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:38:59
Here is one of them 
You see he is paying only **25.64 sat/B** and his transactions get confirmed.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:14:39
Unfortunately there are many users who pay right now too high fees like 870.77 sat/B, so they are pushing the fees going up.
If you see the mempool is only 2,45MB and 200sat/B where enough.
But if people pay such high fees without reason than everyone else has to pay higher fees.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:17:27
Lets see who is the noob in the next days and who is the REAL idiot!

Well done!
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:01:39
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:24:02
Also check  the Estimated Next Difficulty: is +5,4% which also helps the price to go up as miners get less Bitcoin when the difficulty is going up
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:26:14
I told you 3 days ago that it was a good time to BUY!!!
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:06:36
Yes and he is paying 817.74 sat/B fees. Its too high!!! Paying high fees without reason is pushing all the fees geting higher!
Right now 100 sat/B fees are enough to get confirmed!
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:05:10
ok you dont understand how bitcoin works, just learn from others than
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:10:25
BU will not win dont you see how strong the Core supporters are!?
You dont need any steps
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:20:03
Why? You have to look at  so you can see that Unlimited is loosing and Core is growing again.
Antpool is big but the community is much bigger! Also the Estimated Next Difficulty: will be +5,4% in 2 days which also help the price go up as the miners will get less Bitcoin... there are many thinks you have to look at YOURSELF and dont wait to read any news as noobs do

As we know the next block will be mined in about 10minutes. So if we use LIVE informations for Fee/Size like that from  and douple the shown fee/size (as it can increase till the next block is mined) we can be almost sure that the transaction will be mined in the next block.

According to the Hashrate right now which is: 5,420,684,028 GH/s
We whould need about 401,532 Antminers S9 to get the same Hashrate of Bitcoin right NOW
So 50% of the whole network mining power is still 200,766  S9 miners
With 15,000 or 20,000 S9 you whould have 3,74% or 4,98% of the network. Its not too much!

Thats interesting!
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:40:02
Thats why we have problems scaling Bitcoin. There are enough solutiions out there but the community has become so big that there are many different thoughts out there. 
People wake up and think long therm!!! If more than 80% of the entire hashing power and 80% of transactions’ source software or service, of the Bitcoin industry agree to the  in New York agreement, why whould a Hard Fork be a problem! 
**A UAHF whould be a much bigger problem than SegWit2x.**
Whuch of both whould you prefer?
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:15:38
Also when the Bitcoin dominance doubles from 44.5% right now to 89% the price whould be about 5800 USD. So be realistic please!
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:38:47
Yes it can because people are in PANIC!!! RELAX and think longterm!
**RIGHT NOW the price of Btc in many Exchanges of CHina and Korea is about $2550.**

Whaaaat!!! Your calculations are too optimistic! Have you ever heard about the mining cost? You forget it on your calculations definitely
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:30:52
Before you add more coins on this paper wallet you have to be sure that your password is working/ that you have write it correctly down. Use mycelium, scan the qr-pass and after asking for password just type it in to see if it is working. Dont worry your coins will not move after entering your password directly!
If you want to add regularly BTC on the same wallet keep in mind that the more inputs you have on an address the more fees you have to pay after sending them to another adress.
So after 5 transactions to the address i whould recommend to create a new one!
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:23:01
I think it will go higher till mid-end of July!
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:34:40
Dont worry! This whole situation will make Bitcoin stronger and more secure!
After this Ethereum bubble* pops Bitcoin dominance will increasy as before.
*Why i say bubble? You have to realize that all the Token's and ICO's which are build on ONE only chain that of Ethereum are Centralized as they have all the same Blockchain as base! So if something changes on Ethereum's Blockchain or they get in trouble like last year, the price will CRASH dramatically.
Keep that in Mind!!!
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:40:43

You have to be very carefully when using shapeshift, because their support is very slow. You will have to wait up to 48hours to get an answer.
So before using shapeshift notice that:
You are not sending ,more than the limit! (You sent 4000GNT which is more than the limit of 64GNT, so it failed)
You are not sending from an exchange to shapeshift. ONLY send your coin/token from your own wallet, otherwise it will no proceed.
*Im sure your problem will be solved, but you have to be VERY patient with their support though.

There is no fake difficulty, i didnt say that. I just said that the difficulty is not at the same "high" level as the price for 1 Bitcoin. Right now almost everyone in any country make profits mining Bitcoin, so the supply is higher than the last 12 months due to the sell presure from mining worldwide at any country.
**Remember my words and you will see how the price will go down to the level of $1400!** 
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:12:35
Be carefull, dont panic if the price goes down now! You have to Hold strong the next 2 Months. If you dont sell you dont loose any money. Just keep that in mind. I predict that the price will go to about $1400 in the next 1,5 Months
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:35:31
My opinion is based on the "miner price/cost" for 1 Btc! The real price of 1 Btc is about $1400 right now for the actual difficulty of the network!
So the price of Btc right now is overvalued! Buyers are getting less due to the summer months and holidays/vacations
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:56:40
If half of us buy one S9, we still have 25% which is for BIP148 very helpfull. The problem is you cant find till 1August 100K S9 miners....Miners have to signal to SEGWIT. Thats the most realistic scenario

The case is that if the fees stay high as now, people will use Bitcoin more as a store of value, than to transact value/money.
Bitcoin will become the GOLDstandard for all ALTCOINS out there!
Bitcoin = Gold2.0   IT's SIMPLE!

I hope BIP148 will end fine! But as UAHF is coming after August 1st, a Hard Fork is not avoidable! Longterm, it seems to me like a split will happen as it happens to Ethereum last year. Thats why i think SegWit2x is the best solution as it includes both (SegWit and HardFork, which will happen after BIP148 with UAHF if we dont change anything right now)
So dont you think its better to have SegWit2x for long term! I think both sides will be happy with that, if you compare it with UAHF!
