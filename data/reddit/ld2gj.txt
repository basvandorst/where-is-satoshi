Been approved, several times. Never had a problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:33:12
yea, no. I know a few people in the IT world that use flip-phones. They don't want to deal with data plans, privacy is another issue, price of the phone. So, nope, the two are mutually inclusive. in this case

Always pay my stuff off on time, and I have over a 750 and get offers all the time. So, not sure where you got that from. 
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:20:55
Because the first three can be proven by science and will be repeated over and over. Bitcoin is like any form of currency, it comes and goes.
@_date: 2015-12-23 17:55:38
Corruption pays though. That is the problem. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 22:01:28
Someone needs to tell LEAs to keep their grubby little meat beaters off innocent people's money.

I am a Texan and also Active Duty Air Force, what plans do you have to improve Texas; I am mostly concerned with the education system and the current Common Core teaching, the over powered zero-tolerance policy, some of the indoctrination into compliance, etc.

The image of a nuke going off. That is pretty powerful. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 15:17:29
That's good. I have not lived in Texas for almost 4 years. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:14:36
Thank you. And also, you reminded me to update my absentee voting information, so another thank you.

Go deep throat a cactus. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 03:58:48
I would contact the FCC about this, not sure if it is illegal. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 04:53:58
Wait...why would you block 80 and 8080?
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:47:27
I would put this more towards McCarthyism. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:56:51
No, I cannot stand people who say that it should be legal to willingly and knowingly endanger innocent lives.  There are many people who disagree with me on a daily basis; atheists, anti-gun, anti-LGBT, anti-equal marriage, the list goes on. I do not hate them; they are entitled to their opinions. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:05:54
Do I think there are some rules that need to go away, yes. Do I know there are some rules that are in place for a reason. Yes.
Now with the OP stand on DD; if you are on your own property, you get drunk, you decide you seem to know all and start driving; fine hope you die fast and do not kill anyone else. COPs only need to get involved to fill out the police report. But the moment your drunk ass hits a public road driving a car; someone should just put a bullet in your head. It's cheaper and faster. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:00:43
No, I state that because drinking and driving are illegal because the people who do this are not just a threat to themselves but others around them. There may not be anyone there, but there may be. You never know. Also, if there is an accident, alcohol can lead to you dieing faster (blood being too thin to clot, etc). 
Also, the battering part? Do I really need to cover this one?

How does it feel to know that you destroyed your argument with examples of actual crimes?
Actions that were made illegal to protect innocent people.
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:52:32
DD in a nutshell: horrible and foolish action, should not be illegal. But hang on, we know driving drunk is bad, right? Yes of course. It is horribly foolish, irresponsible, and disrespectful. But just because it’s a bad idea doesn’t mean it should be illegal." Granted, your example just used the person driving on their own property. 
Domestic Abuse: That argument made no sense. And have no idea where you were trying to make with a sport and marriage. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:18:24
Then you should not have used it. 
Why I think you are trying to make a great point; you need to look at the audience. Drinking and Driving and Domestic Abuse are not the best options for this point. 
Better points would have been smoking pot and saggy pants. Even though these do not cause any harm to innocent people; smoking pot is illegal in most of the US and saggy pants are starting to become illegal in many places. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:39:48
FUCKING EXCUSE ME! I do care for the victims! I lost a friend because of stupid fucks who drink and decide they can drive. That is why I volunteer for Airmen Against Drunk Driving almost every weekend I can. 
@_date: 2013-08-26 21:38:37
I'm not laughing. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:54:58
Yea, that would be like shutting down Anon.  Good luck, God speed, and see you later. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:54:31
They can try and make it illegal to use BitCoins, but all they will do is make it harder. People can/will still use them.
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:57:56
Also hating people takes too much time, effort, and energy. It's just easier to let them know they are in the wrong, tell them how they are in the wrong, and move on. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:03:20
I think I did. And then you came in here and started to say shit about me, when you do not even know me. 
@_date: 2013-08-26 20:31:40
DHS will just issue a gag-order. 
@_date: 2013-08-26 20:23:21
Tomorrow's news:
"Bitcoin Lobbyists were arrested by DHS for terrorists connections."
A week later:
"Several key bitcoin lobbyists killed in attempted prison escape."
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:38:39
Statements about DD and Domestic Abuse?
@_date: 2013-06-06 23:57:22
No it will not. People will still live together. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:39:23
The person who wrote this must have been high, mentally not there, or trolling. Because can anyone really be that stupid (knowing better, but still doing it anyways)?
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:56:01
They tried to stop "piracy", all they did was make it harder. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 13:11:10
To many. Way to many.
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:49:44
So you are saying that drinking and driving are just fine?
Domestic Abuse, you half witted twit, is not just to a spouse, but is a pattern of behavior which involves the abuse by one partner against another in an intimate relationship such as marriage, cohabitation, dating or within the family. And does not just mean to cause physical violence to said person, but also includes mental abuse as well.
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:17:01
Try and force something on a person, and they will resist; try and deny a person something, and they will fight for it. When knowledge is open to all; the powerful become weak and the weak shall become powerful. 
@_date: 2013-08-26 20:30:43
It may not reined in, but it can be destroyed. Make it illegal for banks to use it, websites to it can be blocked, etc. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:58:38
So the person was suffering from a bought of stupidity.
