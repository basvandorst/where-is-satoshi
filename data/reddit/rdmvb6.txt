True, but what did he have to lose? If you're gonna die with 100% certainty, no hope for a cure in your short time left, why not freeze yourself if you've got the money? Worst case, you are dead, which was going to happen anyway, and you don't need the money in this case. Even if there's a 0.0001% chance we find a cure for ALS and a good way to unfreeze you... there's still a non zero chance of it happening.

Too bad the average person is too dumb to know that federal reserve notes means cash. Poll would probably look a lot different if he had used language understood by the common person (morons).

Just found my old multibit.keys file while cleaning out old USB sticks. I am 99% certain there is no bitcoin left in this wallet but would like to confirm since it is from as far back as 2013! So I downloaded an old version of multibit (which is discontinued) and went to import the .keys file but it is password protected and I can't remember the password. Is there an easy program that I can use to brute force the password? I have a list of words and numbers that I likely used in some combination so it might not even take that long. Thanks for any help and no, I won't send it to you so you can try it, don't bother trying to scam me.

Goddammit it better be over $75k by 2025 or I'll never be able to get my lambo. GTFO dude.

Yes, real estate has some advantages and is more stable but realize that the government can legally take your land if you cannot pay your property taxes. You never REALLY own the land, you are just leasing it for as long as the government allows you to and at whatever rent (property tax) they say that you owe. The government cannot take my bitcoin or charge me an ever changing tax rate every year just for holding it.

If we assume that society has degraded to the point that the gov't is torturing people to extract information, then sure, nothing is safe. What I'm getting at is that the gov't can't use legal methods such as foreclosure for failure to pay property tax to confiscate the property, but I think you already knew that. Also if I buy the bitcoin in person for cash and store it in a paper wallet, the gov't has no record of who owns that bitcoin or how much I have. This differs from real estate where the gov't is literally the custodian of the land ownership records.

Reserves, by definition, does mean that they are available and profitable to extract, but the main comment does not clearly say how much of that 8.45% is reserves vs. resources. There is a key difference in mining. Reserves can be feasible extracted now. Resources include everything that we know is in the ground, whether or not it is profitable to extract at current rates. You probably already knew this, but posting for others who may not immediately know the difference between resources vs. reserves.

Wide scale quantum computers would be a challenge that could be handled with new algorithms and address types, and would not mean the death of bitcoin. We have already changed address types before, it is just a soft fork. Bitcoin would continue.

I prefer to use the cash app for buying small amounts of BTC. Its not lightning and there are fees but its really easy for small amounts. Yes, there is KYC involved to withdraw it to your own wallet.

Ya, but then the problem is... you live on a farm in the midwest.  I think I'd rather pay the taxes, haha.

Try not paying your property taxes for a while and see how much you really own that house. An individual can never truly own real estate, you can only lease it from the government until they say you can't anymore. Just take a look at the great many old people who lost their houses when their fixed incomes couldn't keep up with rising property taxes in gentrifying areas.
Full disclaimer: I also "own" my house, but have no delusions that it couldn't be taken from me.

Yes, property tax is a big issue for people in the US. Many old people lose their homes that they have been in for a long time when the local gov't decides that you are now in a special taxing district, or just when property values go up due to new development around you. My metro district raised my taxes about $150/month this year and will probably do the same as often as possible.

11. If you screw up, your money is gone and there is no third party to get it back for you.
It goes both ways. Great freedom and great responsibility.

No coin reward but they would still receive transaction fees, which will have eclipsed the block reward long ago anyway.
