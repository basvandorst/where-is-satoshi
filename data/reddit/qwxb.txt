Trezor has a nicer UX compared to Ledger Nano S, as you input your PIN on the host computer. It still retains high level of security thanks to the changing layout matrix implementation. On ledger, you have to shuffle through numbers on the device, using two buttons. Also the pin is limited to 4 numbers. The display on Trezor is also larger, it can display the entire address. Trezor is also supported by more applications ;)

The screen is hard to get used to, at least for me. If they used a better segment screen (i.e. more segments per letter), then maybe, but right now deciphering letters is a pain.

It doesn't matter that you generated the key offline.. if you wanna spend your Bitcoins, you will have to enter your private key somewhere. A paper wallet will not send the transaction to the bitcoin network for you; a hardware wallet will, while keeping the private key safe.

A.k.a. throw a few "evil" states into my argument and everyone will piss their pants in fear and agree with me.

With Trezor, iirc you can run the backend on your own computer: myTREZOR, Bitcore server, you can even compile your own firmware. This way you can be absolutely sure there is no backdoor.
Hardware wise, if anyone tried to modify the Trezor in transit, you would notice it on the case of the device, as the device cannot be opened without breaking the casing. Firmware is also checked at every boot up; the locked bootloader verified the signature, if it is signed by SatoshiLabs.
*The aforementioned multisig, using multiple hw wallets, is a good solution too.*

A) You're just fear-mongering and B) assuming America is the only free place in the world and that's why you should control ICANN. Frankly, stupid. Also C), by citing Breitbart you've not only forgot to do your research, but jumped on the Republican hype train of "America is Great, we are the only ones that can save the world" mentality.
Your statement would be true if there was only one DNS server in the world, or if all DNS servers were controlled by ICANN, neither of which is true.
