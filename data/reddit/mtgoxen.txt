I would sell 80 to 100% now. No one knows what the future holds. You have not made or lost anything until you cash out. Have you checked out It seems strange to me that you don't know how many coins you have. If you can wait until the new year I believe capital gains tax (if you are in the USA and you plan on claiming the gains) will be less (10 % vs 35 %) but the market is so volatile it could very well crash between now and then. If you are careful and sell over the counter you may not need to claim capital gains. I am not giving any advice here. Personally I think you are a fool for not having sold already.

The net taxes don't really change much if he sells over time vs at once. Also it is not really clear why he owes the government taxes in a moral sense. What part did they play in his gain? He may not even live in the USA. Although if he thinks the price of BTC will continue increase in the future it may make sense to stay somewhat in the game. It depends on his risk preference. Statistically there is a greater than 80% chance that BTC will crash after the parabolic growth rate it has recently enjoyed.

Let's get real. $800,000 is enough for some (even young) people to retire on, if you invest it wisely and don't deplete the principle...and if you don't need a lambo to make you fill a bigger man. I would not say keeping it in BTC at this time qualifies as investing wisely...
