well go and check the past graphs. Before every halving there is a small bull run, ending in correction after the halving, aka last dump, and then btc goes to the moon

Miners are smart people. They are keeping the profits they make, not dumping it, because they know Halving is coming. IMO thats why we jumped from 4k to 8k in such a short time. The miners are not dumping. Also thats why I am bullis till may 2020, then bearish. Price gonna correct 30-40% month or two after the halving

I really think im not stupid, expanding my mining operation. Curently mining profit of 400$, and using that to buy more miners. From my calculation if i buy and spent every btc i mine, till October. I could more than double my operation, from around 0.045BTC a month to 0.105BTC a month by October. Then to get even i would only need 3 months, and to be in profit 3 more months. (equipment is cheap here, also the power). I'm still worried so any advice would help.

I tend to disagree. Its not a race to the bottom, because there is no bottom. Yes, difficulty goes up, but it also goes down.
1. My first point here is the price of electricity. You don't need to have free power. You just need to have cheaper power than around 60% of the world. That is around 10c/1kwh. Everything below just is more ideal to you. Im mining with 7c/1kwh. 
2. The trend of the market. Many are mistaken here, thinking when the price goes up, mining is better than bying cash. Best time to mine is when the price is down, near 0 profit, when most of the world is turning off their Asics. This means you pay for ur electricity as you would buy coins from the market. The difficulty tends to go down, so the amount of mined coins is bigger, although the amount of usd is smaller/ non existent. 
3. When the trend of the market goes up, so does the value of mining equipment, so every good farm then is just selling their asics, with inflated value, and waiting for the price to settle, to buy new equipment/coins.
So I can say, mining with even 1 satoshi a day is more profitable than buying. 
My example. May 2018, market is crashing, its bad to buy BTC, bad to buy mining equipment, still expensive. 2 months of sideway movement, before the massive November crash, i had 2000$ to spare. Bought antminers that were mining 0.003btc after power a day. (the USD is irrelevant). If i mined only with them or bought BTC at 6k, i would have 0.33BTC. I would be up today and would have around 3k$. But I mined, and Kept on buying asics instead of keeping coins. In november my asics were almost no profitable, but I paid for power form my salary from november till march. With the btc, I reinvested them in cheap ass s9i for 200-300$max. I never held a big amount of BTC by this time, i just reinvested. Now i mine around 0.015 btc a day, even with the ATH difficulty. On the first PUMP i sold some of the asics, for inflated price 300-500, and even selling more while I write this. Ive made around  1.3BTC till now. I kept the money from the sold asics, because i was wasting FIAT to pay for power when i was zero profit. Now i will wait for the bull run to start. After it ends, ill do the same with the next gen of asics. 
By comparation if i bought in MAY, i Would have 3000$ now. With mining now i have 10000$. And some asics, and cash. Mining as a hobby is nice. Hodling is not. Hodling is the worst scam in whole BTC universe.
