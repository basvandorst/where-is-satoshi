sorry i meant' they "buy" at 7k and i am the seller...so i have btc and they wil pay via paypal...then supposedly resulting in chargeback if it's hacked or they want to cash-in withotu loses. so you're right but bottom line: how come such price differences exist?

thanks, well i know! I am in my late 20s so I've been terrorized by paypal a lot in the past :) for no reason...they'd ask for id and limit the account just because you receive $1000+ and have no history before that. Sometimes they don't even reply to your e-mails on purpose....
The worst I agree are chargebacks, they will 99% of the time side with whoever sent the money since their logic is 'we don't care , just return the money...better safe than sorry' - they make zero effort to understand if someone is a scammer or not...lazy employees it seems. 
again, i'd love to deal with bank transfers/wire or moneygram/wu but these great prices only occur on paypal. I suspect these may be young people ~20 who have never worked with bank/wu agent in their life and like to move everything from online...like you said: getting paid from freelancing or donation...
In any cases I think localbitcoins is better than paxful, the abundance of nigerian customers with 10-20 feedback deals doesn't strike confidence. On localbitcoins it's some dude from America with 200+ deals and minutes ago online, looks better.

xenophobic? is the word you may be looking for...i've traded with people from kenya but come on...it's nigeria! the infamous 419 scam...you know.
