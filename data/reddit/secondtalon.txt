Sure.  So what's the difference between Bitcoin and Beanie Babies then?  Or He-Man toys, Baseball cards, or any other collectible out there?
All the tech backing it, scalability, transaction assurance and so on doesn't matter for a hill of beans if the 45,000 people on the planet interested in it try to hold on to as much as they can and... no one else gives a shit.
Holding a portion is a good individual strategy.  So is using a portion as a currency.
Holding is a shitty group strategy.  Using is a good group strategy.
Keep 80% sure.  But spend 20%.  And no, selling to another collector doesn't count.  That's just financial incest.

First you have to define "use better".
Are you talking a cost-benefit examination, are you talking a number-of-citizens-affected-per-unit-of-currency ratio, are you using another metric or group of metrics or what?
And how long are we measuring?  Immediate benefit, year later, decade, 50 years, century, etc?
My point being that Government is sometimes the only entity that will spend the money for something needed *because* no one else will, because it doesn't make economic sense.  It just helps 20 people live like everyone else without having to move and sell their land.

Do you want reliable money?  Compound interest.

That said, you will probably get your investment back and some gains.  You may even sell at 150%.  You'll believe you made the right choice when it drops a month later.  You'll kick yourself for being an idiot when it's up 10X six months after that.
Or it'll crash and be worthless. 
Like any investment, you have to know the risks.  BTC has the constant, omnipresent risk of Governments simply outlawing the buying, selling, creation, and possession of it.  Look in to Bernard von NotHaus as an example.
But Wall Street is now interested, which brings a whole different class of investor too.
If you're using Bitcoin as a "Get rich in six months" thing, you're an idiot.  You might.  You might also win the lottery.  You could die tomorrow of a brain aneurysm.  There's tons of unknowns.  There's tons of unknowns about Bitcoin.

My point of contention isn't that the comparison is good.
My point of contention is that infinite tulips is impossible, contrary to the earlier statement.
T = G x E x N
Assuming Tulips never spoil, where T is number of tulips, G is number of growing seasons, E is amount of Earth's surface used to grow tulips, and N is number of tulips planted per season, T will never equal infininity.
To suggest you can get unlimited tulips from the ground is to display a profound misunderstanding of farming, plants, and three dimensional spaces.

You have a "gut feeling" that it's going to screw you over.
I have no idea when you invested, but... did you research it?
The first time it hit $1000 was in late 2013, like.. December 2013.  It bounced around until Feb where it dropped, and kept slowly dropping, bottoming out at $200 in mid to late 2015. 
Keep that in mind - **everyone who bought in around the $1000 mark because "it was going to the moon!" watched their investment crumble to a fifth of what they paid over the course of a year and a half.**
The second time it hit $1000 was in January... of 2017.
So if you bought for $1000 in December of 2013, you couldn't recoup your losses until 2017.  Three years and some change later.
Now, depending on who you talked to, the price hit $17000something or $19000something.  It's now falling again.
I wouldn't be surprised for it to drop below $3000.
And it'll be above $17000 eventually.
You didn't invest so much that waiting three or more years for an actual increase is going to hurt you, right?  You researched it and understood the price history, the swings it makes and the lengthy recovery time, right?  It didn't slowly increase to $1000 that first time - the price of Bitcoin is a tale of incredible increases, dramatic drops, and it ending higher than where it started the run, sure, but taking years to get back above the prior high water mark.
So yeah, you may not be an idiot thinking you can make some money.
You are an idiot if you think you're going to do it *quickly*.

While I know that past performance is no indicator of future performance, it has gone from something around $100 to almost $1000 in a very short - handful of weeks - span of time.  That same performance at a starting point of $5000 would put it at 4.5 million.
I'm not expecting 4.5 million.  Or even .5 million.

It's almost a decade old.  The "It's young tech" is no longer an excuse.
Right now, it's just an invitation for another crypto to replace it.  One that can confirm in 30 seconds.  Even if the funds take a day to transfer, a crypto that has baked in a verification of "This wallet contains enough to pay X, that amount is now earmarked for transfer and cannot be interrupted" will easily replace Bitcoin as a currency.
And possibly as a commodity too.

Taken from a page describing Bitcoin Cash.  At one point - Aug. 1st 2017, they were the same network.  Bitcoin Cash forked.
In my hypothetical, Happiness Joy took an equal share of users as Hapiness retained.  Had Happiness Joy taken more users, it would have consensus and .. most likely have never changed it's name, forcing the other route to change.
With your explanation, I see no flaw in my hypothetical.  Happiness Joy is an analog for any altcoin fork of Bitcoin and Happiness Core is Bitcoin.
Basically, my question is quite simply that if a fork happens that - as far as anyone can tell - evenly splits the users, what mechanism is in place to identify the "Original" versus the offshoot?  Or is it even sensible to argue that, and instead it should just be accepted that the original is dead and two offshoots are what remain?

BTC was $1 in Feb-April of 2011.  It hit $31 then was down to $2 by December.
If you saw this video in January, you would have bought in when it hit about $20 because until then it was still a pipe dream but $20?  That's "getting serious" money.  And you'd be riding high at $31.
And then you'd have dumped at $5 trying to get at least some of your money back, and you'd laugh at the idiots still HODLing at $2.

It's not even a decade old.  Yeah, it's gone from $0.01 (or less!) a coin to - at least on some exchanges - $20k.
It's currently $6500ish.
It's not even been a decade - it's entirely possible Bitcoin will go tits up for some reason and for some entirely sound reason (though I can't imagine what) Coinye revives and becomes the leader of cryptocurrency.
... okay, that's too far, but my point remains that Bitcoin is the top dog *right now*.  Anyone saying they know with 100% certainty that in a decade that Bitcoin will still be the leader is either talking horseshit, deluded by the Religion of Bitcoin, or hiding a time machine.

If you think that much storage isn't really feasible, though....
The first 5MB drive weighed a ton and [looks like it was about the size of two refrigerators](
In weight, assuming 80g for a 1TB SSD, the same one-ton weight would be 11344 (rounded up from 11343.495 because you can't have .495 of a drive) for... 11.3 Petabytes.
So right now, 1 ton will be roughly 11.3 Petabytes when in '54 it was 5 MB.
Assuming a similar level of increase and we're going to be able to store that many on a home drive in... okay, a few centuries, but then the idea of a Home Computer in '54 was that in several decades the homeowner would have a refrigerator sized appliance in their home as their only computer.  
Whereas now we've got more computational power in a coffee maker than the 1954 computer had.
So while I don't expect to see consumer hard drives large enough to hold that in my lifetime, I would expect it in my grandkid's lifetime.

Bitcoin first hit $1000 in late 2013 before crashing down to $400ish in early 2014, and continued to bleed until it got to low $200 in 2015.
It hit $1000 again in 2017.
While I know that historical performance does not indicate future performance....  the prior rises and falls of Bitcoin follow similar patterns - rapid spike, rapid crash (though higher than before the spike), slow crash, slow rise, rapid spike.
I'm saying that it's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.  I'm honestly surprised it hasn't dropped to the $4000 ranges.

@_date: 2018-08-07 15:28:10
Honest question here - and while technically there are parallels, I don't believe the Bitcoin Cash userbase was anywhere near Bitcoin's base, I'm just making the hypothetical essentially identical for the question.
An open source software named Happiness exists, started by someone who for all purposes appears to have wandered away from the software entirely.  Over the years various forks have come, some gone, some still in use, but none have claimed to be Happiness, just variations of it (some claiming to be superior, sure, but none claiming to be The True Path) 
Years later, the people involved in it have an argument over certain modifications to the code and roughly 48% of the users go one way, the other roughly 48% go the other way, with the remaining 4% going some weird third (or fourth) way because that always happens.
So we have two large groups, roughly the same size, are on two different, incompatible forks of the software working towards similar, but due to implementation, mutually exclusive goals.  Somewhere along the way one of the groups aquired the name Happiness Joy while the other became Happiness Core.
Happiness Joy users claim they are the ones who are carrying on the original intent and are the true Happiness heirs.  Happiness Core users disagree.
How do you tell which one is right?  The original documentation is open to interpretation, as is the original intent.  The name is also not a great place to start - there's plenty of Nations out there with Democratic Republic in their names who are anything but.  And, of course, what Happiness actually does is completely irrelevant - anything from a fancy clock with neat alarms to a network based operating system, doesn't matter what it does just that it all needs to be the same across the network to work correctly.  
Assuming a design document open to interpretation and a more or less equally split userbase, how do you determine who gets to call themselves the heir?  Is it simply a matter of how you yourself interpret the design documents, or is there an objective way?
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:14:10

Not growing wealth.  Storing and transferring.  Using it instead of wire transfers.  Using it to buy shit.
Yeah, I know "I've got a bitcoin ATM on my block I can easily blah blah blah" you're not Joe Q Public.  What you want is for parents to send their kids cash at college by bitcoin.  For Grama to send $50 birthday money by bitcoin.  For that cheapass uncle to send the combination birthday/christmas gift (They're not even six months apart it's practically the same thing) of $5 by Bitcoin.  And for those kids to use that bitcoin for... whatever relatively inexpensive thing it is kids buy these days as apparently they don't buy albums anymore.  What the hell, kids?
Is the Bitcoin community any closer to solving that problem?  I know it's just my experience, but the latest boom to 20k and subsequent correction pretty much wiped any "Internet currency" thoughts people around here had about it and replaced it with "Oh, that internet scam thing".

During the years between the original founding, the software has changed.  There is no reasonable argument to be made that v1.0 and the current version are the same.
Happiness Joy has made an addition, that is true, but Happiness Core is v1.57.3845.482 as well.  
The argument can be made that while Happiness Joy has made 176 changes,  Happiness Core has made 175 itself, rendering the argument of "It's changed so it's no longer Happiness" invalid.

If people lose private keys and access to their money, demand is going to go down as they will likely not want to repeat the same mistakes.
If there are fewer and fewer coins to buy, that means they aren't circulating, so it's not a currency but a commodity.  
Commodities have a real-world value.  Pork futures are based on the price of pigs at a future date.  Gold is valued because people like shiny things.
Bitcoin's function is... what, exactly?  
At least USD can be used as tinder to start a fire.  
To be clear, I'm arguing that for the demand for the coin to be similar to what it is today despite the generation of coins being over because all of them were mined AND coins being lost, the coins are going to have to be circulating as a currency.  Meaning that it's less important what they are individually worth - a satoshi could be worth $.10 USD for all it matters - at that point, you'll be using it as money and not thinking in terms of converting to fiat to buy things, but thinking in terms of converting to another nation's currency.  
Treating it increasingly like a commodity that needs to be hodled doesn't get us to that point any faster.  If anything, it lowers demand since ... well, when the average person can't tell you what the hell you can use it for, then it's not a commodity.  And if the average person can't spend it anywhere, it's not a currency.  So the average person would conclude it's nothing.

That the statement is being read here as "The internet is a useless fad" when the statement appears to be "The internet will, in one decade, produce the same economic growth as 150 years of the fax machine", which is an endorsement of the internet as a business tool.
Without the context of surrounding statements, the single statement quoted is ambiguous.  The tone appears to be negative, but the words themselves and their meaning are positive.

It's totally a bubble.  It's going to crash down again, probably to the $4000 neighborhood.
Then it'll slowly start to roll back up, hit $11,000 or so... then get on another crazy bubble that takes it up to $150,000 before it crashes again.
To $30,000.

I honestly can't tell if this quote is supposed to mean the Internet isn't going to go anywhere or if it means that the Internet's going to do big things.
I don't know the economic impact of the fax machine, but I know it had one.  The ability to send and receive legal documents when you're hundreds of miles apart is a game changer.  Fax machines built Railroads.  I mean, in 1998 the fax machine was over 150 years old - so the statement would be that by 2005, the Internet - as far as the consumer was concerned about a decade old - would have the same impact as 150 years of the fax machine.
That... sounds like a huge endorsement of the Internet.
But given the comments here, the comment is supposed to be negative?  That Paul's saying the internet's a fad that'll pass with time?

Taking the question at face value - is it possible to make money off of bitcoin without actually purchasing bitcoin - requires defining what "purchasing bitcoin" means.
As in - You are an investor with nearly no technical knowledge but have read a bit about these Bite-Coinage things, and find the idea exciting and revolutionary but don't actually know how to go about getting your hands on any.  You know that I am technically minded but also have no money.  You discuss with me and come to an agreement where you will hand me a certain value of cash every month - say $5,000 - and I am to use it to purchase virtual currencies with them based on my following of the market with the understanding that I will create a new cold storage wallet every month and hand over all private keys to be filed in your papers on your investments.  
As a payment, I am allowed to keep 10% of the monthly funds to do with as I will.  I choose to take the $500 and use it as a supplement to my income, paying off outstanding debt, buying better quality of groceries, getting a gym membership and so on, possibly even buying traditional investments but never buying bitcoin for myself.
While I think it would be difficult to argue that I'm not making money off of Bitcoin, and it would be difficult to argue that I am the owner of the Bitcoin as I turn everything over to you as soon as it's generated, and it is also very difficult to argue that you are not buying Bitcoin - you spend money, you get Bitcoin in return - the question remains - am I buying bitcoin?
The ad itself is almost certainly hot garbage clickbait.

I don't see a long-term threat here, just something that will get regulated as time goes on, either by actual laws or by standard practices as people engaged in the system refuse to do business with exchanges that aren't more transparent.

Only if demand stays the same or increases.
Real Estate is a historically good investment as there's only so much land and, barring industrial accident, it increases in value.  It may not increase at the rate the owner wants... but it does increase.  Demand for land will always be growing.
Valuable Goods are a little more like bitcoin in that it's , but some goods grow their value better than others.   Demand for the item will go through ups and downs, but generally unless you're investing in Beanie Babies, you're going to do fine.  Just not as fine as you want.
Stocks - like valuable goods, only more volatile due to market forces.
In all of those cases - picking one as your investment solution is a sucker's game.  You want land, goods, and stocks.  You want diverse selections too - an empty field will grow in value, but a building you rent makes you money while it grows in value.  If you only collect valuable weapons you can get screwed as weapon possession laws change, but if you throw some art and precious metals in there as well, you're more insulated.
I shouldn't have to say that a diverse stock portfolio is your goal.
Bitcoin is either a commodity and a way to store wealth - in which case you want it to be highly desired but infrequently moving - or it's a currency and a way to transfer wealth - in which case you want it to be moving frequently.  
As is, if Bitcoininfocharts is even close to accurate, 40% of the coins are in .01% of the wallets.
That does not sound like a *smart* investment to me.  If I try to use Bitcoins as a long-term (10+ year) store of wealth, it sounds like 1780 addresses (so probably a quarter of that or even less in people) could turbofuck me with a moment's notice and make my investment a fraction of what it was.

Indeed.  A currency that doubles it’s value in a year is too volitile.  BTC doubled three times in a few months (while also seeing an even greater rise before the corrective crash)
It’s garbage as a currency right now.  And there’s no incentive for a business to hang on to it for any longer than is technically necessary.  Euro, USD, Rubles, Yen - anything but crypto right now.
In a year, if it’s still at $6000ish?  Okay, that’s better - but you’ll still have the history of BTC being stable for long stretches then exploding before settling back down at a higher value....  
It’s fine if you want a commodity, it’s shit if you want a currency.

That's kinda my point - Bitcoin was in a neat position last year of making news and becoming desirable.  It then crashed, and a lot of that desirability fled with it - after all, who wants an investment that can lose 75% of it's value in a month and most long termers simply shrug with a "Yeah, that's what happens"
That's not desirable.
Especially with the theories floating around that a handful of people caused the rise and fall with a pump and dump.  A handful of people shouldn't be able to manipulate a market that much.
It's currently in demand from a small number of people - much smaller than last year at this time.  Getting that trust back is going to be a long hard road - just like it was last time, and the time before that.
And a comeback is not guaranteed.
And all that is assuming there is a supply.  If there's no supply, if buy orders aren't filled in a semi-timely manner - they will stop.
If all the BTC gets bought up and no one sells, you are correct in there being a priceless market.  $0.00 isn't a price, ergo, priceless.

's point is that Gold has concrete uses.  If the Earth was hit by massive electromagnetic waves that obliterated electronics and sent us hurtling back to pre-industrial lifestyles for a few decades, Gold would still have a purpose in the form of ornamentation.  Because people like shiny shit.
Currency could still store wealth as it's easier to carry around a few twenties than it is a few chickens and a goat.  Also easier to make change.
Coins can still be minted - even if they're just flat disks of iron marked with a particularly elaborate die, they're going to be easier to move around.
Stocks, Futures and the like all eventually go back to some concrete thing in the world you can pick up and hold, if you wanted.
Bitcoin is not something you can pick up and hold.

The town has a population of 2,500.  It was 5,000 a decade or two ago, but he local plant closed so....
If you’re lucky, there’s a Wal-Mart.  They aren’t hiring, by the way,
There’s probably a couple of mechanics.  You do know engines, right?  Doesn’t matter because they’re not hiring either.
Groundskeeping?  Maybe they’re hiring, but they’re gonna lay you off in the winter.
Janitorial services?  Already covered.  No one’s hiring.
Pretty much any job there isn’t hiring, especially someone with your job history.
So you’ve got a house and maybe a welfare check.  In fucking nowhere, Iowa.  If you’re lucky, they sent along another couple of hundred or thousand homeless folk like you from all over and now some of those businesses are hiring again due to demand.  Will the existing residents stay, or did your hobo migration kill the town for good?
Now what?  What’s the end goal?  How are you helping by existing in a house in some out of the way town no one’s heard of?  At best, we get a shitload of books out of the program... most of which are lost in obscurity due to the glut.

This allows the dog to be relieved of certain natural selection pressures, allowing for a more complex brain capable of better understanding the species they are cohabiting with.

@_date: 2018-12-12 16:11:49
There's a thing people are trying to make happen where on Jan 3rd everyone with coins on exchanges are supposed to withdraw them to make some kind of point.
What the point is I'm not exactly clear on - that Exchanges don't have a lot of coins ready to go as most are in cold storage?  That if you don't have the keys they aren't really your coins?  That miners need to make more off all the fees that get generated?
I'm not sure.
The idea of ... getting your coins off an exchange and on to your own hardware is a fine one, as far as I'm concerned.  I don't know why an exchange exists as storage - it's an exchange.  Buy, sell, or GTFO.  But apparently they do as there's money to be made there.
I think the goal is for people to pull out their coins, the Exchange can't service everyone as shit's in storage and people stop and think "Gee, if I can't get my money whenever I want, it's not my money and this is acting exactly like a bank, only without interest being paid to my savings account"
Of course, what is actually going to happen is .. assuming a large enough number gets on board for this... the exchanges will run out of hot coins and start trying to pull from cold storage, the market will start to panic that all the exchanges are frauds and thieves and Don't Have The Coins because the owners all bought Lambos, and panic sell, crashing the price.
Meanwhile, some miners are going to make a little bit more than they would have off the fees, some people who got in last year will get out for good, it'll make a nice news story and be largely forgotten in six months with no real lasting damage, just further concentration of coins in to fewer hands.
That's what I figure.  But what the fuck do I know?  I'm just some random asshole on the internet.

It doesn't matter how transferable, divisible, portable something is - if less than a percentage of owners own 90% of it, leaving the remaining 99.5% to fight over 10% of the total - that 99.5% is going to say "Fuck this" and stop giving a shit about it, instead making their own currency.  With blackjack.  And hookers.

Nah, just your local.  Sure, you can use various methods to get around firewalls and the like, but good luck engaging in commerce and seeing the effects of it where you live.

You underestimate the UAE Government.
The US?  Fuck no, never going to happen, way too many laws would need to get changed.  Qatar?  You're fucked.

and you get a Toyota so you have something to drive while they're both in the shop.

Which satellites [owned by who?](  Because those can certainly be stopped.

To what end?  You have an exchange in another country, so you're going to need to transfer that to funds usable to you locally (which will cause the Gov't to come sniffing around to see where the hell your cash is coming from) OR simply use it for commerce outside your nation, meaning either you're having a lot of stuff shipped to you (again, causing sniffing around) or you're simply engaging in business outside your nation and keeping all purchases outside the nation too - at best leading to a situation where you technically have millions but live incredibly modestly as you can't actually touch most of it.
Like, you cannot look at it as a "What if the US banned Bitcoin" sort of thing.  The US isn't going to.  You have to look at it from the standpoint of a nation that actually would - DPRK, China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar - places where there are already authoritarian controls on the flow of information.
Of course, even in the US it'd be pretty easy to start a moral outrage panic (Bitcoin - the currency used by pedophiles!) to make it an uncomfortable to handle currency.

That's one particular ransomware.  There's at least seven major variants and each criminal group re-writes it to serve their own needs.  OP has yet to say which flavor hit.

There are plenty of whitepapers on how to detect internal TOR botnets written for corporate IT departments to keep their users from unintentionally attacking other networks.
Applying that on the ISP scale per Goverment orders?  If you aren't paying for your own bridge, you will be discovered.  If you aren't switching your bridge semi-regularly, you will be discovered.  If you switch your bridge too predictably, you will be discovered.  If you have no reason you can give to connect to your bridge, you will be discovered.
Yeah, if you only connect two or three times a year in Dubai, the local secret police aren't going to kick your door in any time soon.  But if you're doing it nightly and switching bridges every 30 days?  You will be caught.

The purpose was to keep your activities private from interested third parties.  At one point, the US's NSA was involved in it and while they probably aren't at this point - I wouldn't put it past them to still be involved.
At any rate, it's a great program if you're wanting to hide your non-criminal actions simply because you're sick of targeted ads and the like, and don't want your online behaviors to be used by marketing firms as study data for users in a particular geographic area.
If you're using it to engage in criminal acts - actual criminal acts like purchasing crack or acts that shouldn't be criminal but are like criticizing your government - then it's not an iron wall protecting you from all harm, just a line of defense that can and will be overcome if you get sloppy and/or become enough of a troublemaker that they take an actual interest in you personally.

Not for long, no.  Right now, preventing an interested Government party from finding out that you personally are using TOR is just a matter of time.  The steps you can take to slow them down are to switch ISPs and methods of connection, but that's just to slow them from noticing that *someone* is using TOR.  If you're already a Person of Interest - then they already know you're using it.
If you believe otherwise and are in an area where using TOR is criminal, this is you being warned that if you believe you're already a Person of Interest - get the fuck out as quickly as you can, because your Government already knows.

They can ban TOR.  They can ban VPNs.  Both of these tools prevent an outside observer from seeing what you're doing - but they can still see that you're using a VPN or TOR.
So they ban the services.  ISPs who allow them to work get their ability to operate as an ISP removed, fines, and jail time for the owners.
Good luck getting around *that*.
