People earned less money back then, you'd still roughly do the same amount work to earn that milk

You must be an economist yourself
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:13:22
Stop conning yourselves, 99% of the people here are in it for a quick buck, no amount of motivational writing is going to change their minds about their bottom line
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:50:48
Hey man, I was looking for someone to work on a project with me, you seem like you know what your at. I'm currently a student in college also, can you pm me so I can talk to you about it? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:44:36
Welcome to the real world
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:15:44
See that's the thing, It just feels like the general consensus on this thread is that bitcoin will replace the fiat one day, but I can't see that happening when all people care about is the relative value in a fiat currency
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:20:26
You say this as if bitcoin isn't corrupt
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:01:28
Yes I am familiar
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:19:10
You guys are all tinfoil hat wearing lunatics
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:55:54
This is the most idiotic graph of all time
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:20:44
There's nothing wrong with inflation, it's necessary for healthy growth in the economy
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:22:48
You should cry
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:13:21
But measuring it's value against the "worthless" USD is nonsensical?
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:15:50
You think the government are out to get you, and big banks are stealing your money. When really their giving you mortgages in order to buy houses.
If your willing to accept their loan you can't cry about the interest you agree to pay

Man made climate change is a hoax?
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:15:05
What you sir are describing is a bank
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:07:45
I believe the fundamental role of a bank is to create credit, which the economy needs in order to invest in capital and grow, not much innovation is really required? Just that credit is available at reasonable interest rates for investors
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:26:28
Yes I understand this, but they can purchase futures, which the value depends on the value of bitcoin, so if they could manipulate the value of one then they could the other
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:15:25
It was a good watch, so people are really afraid of having to bail out banks that are too big to fail. But if these banks are currently too big to fail, then they still will be even when the bitcoin is worth ten times it is now?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:02:02
When you say investing, do you mean saving?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:17:08
So it's only a matter of time?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:29:41
This was the answer I was looking for really, so it is possible? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:25:53
The economy is sinusoidal
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:40:30
The reading lead to the questions
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:55:58
Thanks, that answer was very helpful. Very sceptical in this whole bitcoin business as you can probably tell, but this thread is a great tool to learn quickly especially when asking specific questions
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:14:57
The "real interest rate" is one of the most basic and well known economic concepts their are.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:32:48
This is my homework, that's why I'm asking the questions
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:45:08
Why would it have bubbles
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:28:21
But if they backed the futures price to decrease?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:01:09
This kind of seems like a situation in school when the students want no teachers, and then when all the teachers are driven out, everyone fails their exams

Fraud is only allowed to live by lack of regulation
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:39:27
The reason 90% of the people are here is to make a quick buck, don't fool yourselves
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:19:55
I see your point, but the current backup systems are others countries, the major crisis in Greece being bailed out by the EU is an example,
I just fail to see the need for the bitcoin at this moment in time
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:39:40
An exponential curve is a function, that rises forever, into infinity

The carbonation is what differentiates wine from champagne
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:35:48
If they had a short position though?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:14:35
Yea that's correct, but my main point was that if it has bubbles it's not wine
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:56:54
But the bubble was due to lack of regulation and crazy lending? Would this not be more prominent in a decentralised system?
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:33:27
What wine are you drinking
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:03:35
Still a student at the moment, I'll make sure to look into it
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:40:00
Ones that aren't real, made up in order to destroy people's faith in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:27:36
The only way transactions are verified is through a majority of the miners verifying them, so if they were to get together and decide to add fake transactions, they could
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:36:52
Definition of an exponential curve is that is rises forever
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:27:38
Maybe because it's true?
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:49:47
The resources are limited, shouldn't be wasted on this crazy idea

Voting? 
Actually never thought of that, that could be really good
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:58:59
Not for long lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:49:02
Utility and scarcity is exactly what value is
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:55:35
I'm really just looking for justification in your ideas
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:03:13
Very good counter arguments, the only one I disagree on is the infinite supply one, hypothetically someone can create a carbon copy of bitcoin, and then it will be in infinite supply, just not the exact name bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:30:00
There's nothing wrong with for profit, profit is the only reason people do buisness
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:59:17
Sorry I misinterpreted you, I was looking at it from a solely economical standpoint, where an item has value if it had utility, and is scarce
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:24:33
Childish attempt at an argument. 
The blockchain for currency is inefficient, visa solved this problem years ago. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:47:27
It's the exact same concept as online banking, which you all fear
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:57:17
Unnecessary risk for them
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:58:38
Sarcasm? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:17:21
That's a super small percentage, 
I'm not saying giving away to charity of bad, I just don't think people should rely on other people's morals or goodwill in this world. 
Buisness is dog eat dog and you can't remove that mentality with a decentralised system
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:50:55
But do you think bitcoin in its current state has value
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:29:34
Just seems like a Ponzi scheme, I wonder how many people got burned at 19K. Most definitely the least knowledge in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:37:37
Profit and greed are what the economy runs on, without that you are looking at communistic societies
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:08:14
And do you think this is impossible? 
And is it not only the majority that needs to be hacked
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:57:12
I meant online banking and PayPal.
Any source for this data breach?
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:56:19
Call it trolling if you wish, but it seems like no one can really defend what they believe in, they just claim it's a new technology and that it's great. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:01:37
"investing" 
You go buy some lottery tickets and call it investing
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:03:56
What proportion does this year have in the 10 year timeline?
Definitily a larger percentage than previous years
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:06:04
No lock is unbreakable at the end of the day.
Blockchain isn't unhackable, just hasn't been done yet. They thought the enigma was unhackable during WW2.
My point is really are we getting value for money with the blockchain. Are all these resources really with the added security
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:32:14
It just seems like overkill to me
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:01:06
Fair enough, but what can it do right now that anything else can't
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:32:52
Lol good joke, 
Seems unnecessary to me, surley you would be an advocator of fraud prevention
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:36:36
That's fair enough, but the battle isn't against the government, it's the free market. Three only way people will adopt anything is if it's the cheapest and best way to do it. And that's not going to happen with bitcoin/blockchain at the moment
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:30:19
The guys on this subreddit will never understand, their too brainwashed with their Eutopia idea
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:40:17
But is that inconvenience worth creating a whole new currency?
Just overkill
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:14:51
I asked a question, I didn't shit on it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:59:43
Yea lol I know, 
Got pretty tired of arguing.
Best of luck with your investment!
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:18:58
So you think blockchain is efficient?
And all the resources used are necessary to keep you data safe?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:14:24
Good explanation, seeing as bitcoin was the first crypto currency, I find it difficult to believe it was perfected in its first try.
I personally think bitcoins value will continue to fall until it's forgotten about, and after a while someone will perfect the technology and implement it for all to use.
Just my two cents though
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:38:39
There will never be a situation where someone will decide they've made enough money. 
If you believe in this then people will close down their factory halfway through the year and lay everyone of when they've made enough profit.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:21:06
Don't cry man, 
Offering a link to various websites isn't an argument
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:47:36
Man your so deluded it's incredible, can you actually see value in bitcoin? 
It has no advantage over visa, people claim it's decentralised and it's amazing. But when push comes to shove people will realise that fiscal policy is actually a good idea. And that central banks aren't evil Nazi caps and actually have the economys best interests in their minds
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:36:01
Anything over 100% a year
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:02:36
Rip your money
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:00:57
Honestly no sarcasm
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:14:18
Cmon man that's not an argument
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:42:19
You sound like someone out of r/iamverysmart
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:57:57
We need to get out of the goodwill mindset.
This is how people are eaten alive in buisness
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:03:30
If that's what you expect to happen then you shouldn't be investing in bitcoin, as their is no money to be made.
The technology will be perfected, and then it will be applied slowly in order to revolutionise transactions. Bitcoin will be forgotten about and then have no value
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:31:04
Your crazy if you think the banks will be replaced by bitcoin. 
No one remortgages their house for a couple brazzers and some lotto tickets
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:20:08
They'll never understand, they fully believe the banks are against crypto because their afraid it will make them obsolete lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:00:49
God almighty, people will post anything here in order to try minimise their own losses at some other poor blokes demise
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:18:21
Your not making any argument whatsoever. Your just claiming you've achieved some sort of higher intelligence and that has allowed you to side with blockchain
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:56:02
Yea every hodlr is just watching their money burn lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:00:02
"The PayPal platform is not impacted in any way, as the TIO systems are completely separate from the PayPal network, and PayPal's customers' data remains secure,"
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:42:40
Banks pay you to hold your money. That's the whole point of the bank. They pay you interest and make money off lending this money to other people. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:35:08
Also is currency really a good use of this technology?
Someone suggested voting earlier, which I can fully get behind, but I just don't understand how it can help with currency
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:26:06
Jesus Christ man relax, your the one calling me ignorant.
I'm assuming your "intellectual video" is being hosted on a website? 
The blockchain is inefficient, and the size of the ledger will increase exponentially with more adopters.
I personally don't believe all the extra resources necessary is worth this "security", especially when everyone already signs away all their data on Facebook, Twitter ect already 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:28:10
Do you believe open source is really that good though. Everyone has an opinion and no one is in charge in that situation.
Bitcoin isn't like gold though, crypto currencies are in infinite supply, it also isn't money, as transactions can take days to go through. 
I personally cannot see a situation where bitcoin can be used to buy anything.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:33:59
It just seems so inefficient in my eyes is all, I obviously don't have a magical solution, but I don't think we should accept it's inefficiencies and just be like ah that's the way it is.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:27:59
Decentralisation seems unnecessary to me, it's no more secure
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:33:33
But have you really thought about the resources necessary, you must be using X amount more resources for fraction more security
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:43:43
Ever heard of PayPal?
