r/bitcoin vs r/btc

Yea, it’s weird. I had it explained as anything talking about any alt-coins is banned. Hm...

They can’t. This subreddit shills for BTC and r/btc shills for what is currently BCH. They believe that BCH will become BTC and they might be right, which scares the shit out of people invested in BTC. I recently cashed out of both, so I no longer have a dog in the fight.

That makes sense, but with all of the accusations coming from the other side, it seems counter-productive to not allow any discussion. People don't like censorship, and I don't see them stopping growing if people feel like this side is controlled by a company.
EDIT: also, it seems odd that they would implement that automod in the past 7 hours:

[Here's the context](
Wasn't even saying anything nice about BCH. Just wanted to get an opinion from a subreddit that supposedly disagrees.

What does litecoin offer that other coins don't?

I wish that's how politics worked.

Well, they're really accepting fiat by way of a third party.

That looks like artificial light to me.
You saw the dress as white and gold, didn’t you?

Should be easy to point some out, if it's full of them, right?

We'll see if the value goes down. There are a lot of new people investing in bitcoin all the time. Many of them will hear "hard fork" and think "oh, free money, just like with Bitcoin Cash".

And because it’s tough for some people to get a bank account for credit card transactions.
