Or you can just get a license and do it without the risk of jail time

I don't know why you're coming to the conclusion that I am. The Asain crisis was caused because many countries had currencies pegged to the USD and they couldn't keep up with the appreciation of the USD. Yes, China holds $3T but that money isn't out of circulation, it's being invested mostly in US Gov't debt. As for your third statement, what source do you have on this information? AFAIK China doesn't even have a QE in the same way we do. They haven't been openly injecting excess cash into the economy, but rather have loosened credit restrictions and have made their balance sheet much riskier.

By buying and selling on localbitcoins you are acting as a broker and thus need a MSB license. if you are daytrading on say the coinbase exchange, they have the license and are acting as the broker.

Could you explain your reasoning in that statement? Government bailouts didn't become a reality until the most recent financial crisis and buffet was far from broke before that. I don't see the wrong in being a investor who truly invests based on the value of a company.

Right, because the Fed is out to make a profit, you know just like every other bank where employees get paid bonuses dependant on the money they've made for the bank. Also the whole concept of export of inflation is that other central banks will blindly print money to exchange for USD overseas, which they don't, and that central banks and other firms will hold excess USD out of circulation, which they don't. Rather they use the USD to invest in USD priced securities. Hence the concept that excess imports leads to investment in the US economy/appreciation of the dollar (funny that the stock market has been rising and the dollar has been appreciating).

Last a recall, the banks did not simply put their hands out for money. Rather the Fed saw that they were on the verge of failing and had the treasury create TARP as a solution. Some banks didn't even want to participate but were somewhat forced to.

Exactly. Everytime I see someone show a graph of a loss of USD value over the past 100 years I'm like yes it did loss quite a bit but who just sits there with all their net work in USD. Take a look at the S&amp;P or DJIA over the same period and it has quite the opposite effect.

And there other option to compensate shareholders is to pay dividends. Either way they are spending money to benefit their shareholders. I don't see what is wrong with this.

Doesn't matter, there are federal MSB requirements under the supervision of FinCEN.

Nah dude don't you know that the Fed is just out to destroy the economy with QE!? They're just gunna keep printing money till the economy crashes! And don't you know that once interest rates rise the stock market is gunna crash!? It's not like people sell bonds when rates rise to move into stocks or other bonds, no, the market just crashes!
