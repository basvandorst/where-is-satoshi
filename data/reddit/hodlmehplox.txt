Which is why I view BTC as a binary option, it will either burn down in a spectacular display of flames or be wildly successful, there are no shades of gray.  No time decay means that my option is good until Bitcoin dies.

Can you elaborate how any of the points I made are garbage?  Serious inquiry.

I'll explain theta, you can look up the rest.
An option is an agreement between two people to trade an asset at an agreed upon price at a specific time in the future.
The strike is the agreed upon price and the expiration date is the day the contract is no longer valid.
If you pay $100 for a call option on an asset that is good for 10 days, the value of that $100 premium you paid will go down (decay) every day that the actual price of the asset is below the strike price of the option.  
In this oversimplified example, your decay is $10/day.  Therefore, if you held the option for five days and the price of the asset was still below the strike, the option would be worth $50 on the open market, not the $100 that you initially paid for it.  
However, in reality theta decay does not have a linear relationship with time and increases at an increasing rate.  Make sense?

LoL, so:
PV = FV / (1 + knowledge)^t
I agree, wholeheartedly.

Nice, during that time I was trading options on gold and silver equities, and futures.  Same event, two different approaches.
One thing I think that most people don't realize is that BTC is THE best non-correlated asset you can own in a portfolio today.  The FED's ZIRP policy has created an environment where all asset class correlations are approaching one, dangerous times to be in the markets if you don't know what you are doing.
