It's been rather stable recently, too much stable... :D

To store some of my money mostly as of now. But pretty much always if there is an option to pay in bitcoin somewhere then I go ahead and do that to show my support and also because the transaction fee's aren't so high any more that they used to be...

Of course we won't be seeing that any time soon in local companies, but it could be a thing soon in a lot of bigger companies.  
  
If there is places you can pay in btc then people will accept btc for their job also.

That's an inside sticker, right?  
If so then can you please tell me where did you get it?

It's pretty stupid to try rob someone wealthy in bitcoin unless they have passwords/keys in a txt file on their desktop. Usually clever enough people for such things don't tend to risk so much...

It'll drop when it activates too I think. People don't like any changes sometimes. ;D.

Of course that the spam of transactions was caused by a major group that just wants more profit on what they are doing... They want bitcoin to go a different way then the majority of normal (maybe less powerful) people want.  
  
Miners want things big, because they want to get bigger amounts while using less power of their machines so of course they are going to go for transactions and not care about small transactions like a payment for a pizza...

If so then what's your target amount?

I mean that instead of just buying bitcoin to wait and see what happens (which actually also KINDA helps bitcoin, but only in temporary price growth) you could for example start up some services related to bitcoin or simply try to convince others to accept bitcoin for their services/products. :D
