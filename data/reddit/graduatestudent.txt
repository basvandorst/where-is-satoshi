BUT CONFIRMATIONS ARE SO MUCH FASTER!!!
I bought $60 worth when it was around $10. Might as well just keep holding onto it forever.

Coinbase has a price per BTC on their front page. I go there every once in a while and log in and buy if it's at a good price. After being on your site for 20 minutes, I still can't see a buy/sell price.

So they're committing to buy *later* at a *higher* price than now, but not as high as they think it will go? Then why not buy *now* at the lower price? I get how this works with grain, since you can buy when there isn't any, but I'm confused as to how it works with Bitcoin.

I understand! Thanks.

Saving Overstock about $600 already on credit card/PayPal fees.
Edit: Probably more like $150 or $200 for credit cards, I'm being told. $300 from PayPal. Still substantial, given that it was only two hours. And no risk of chargebacks.

Then why wouldn't the seller sell now?

I was thinking something similar. How about a person shopping in stores, pulling out a credit card, hesitating, putting it back in and pulling out cash. Going to the ATM to get more cash, looking around, trying to pry off the panel to see if it's fake, deciding to go inside the bank, but it's closed. Going back to the bank in the morning, and a bunch more times. Seeing something to buy online, pulling out the credit card, thinking twice, putting it back. 
Cut to that same person smiling, paying in stores with the Bitcoin App, online with Electrum, or what have you.

I assumed this, so I'm glad someone said it so I could be corrected.

But it still contributes to the discussion. If he hadn't said it, or if it gets downvoted, many people might also assume they buy and sell at different prices, since *every other money changed ever* does. So it's a useful post. It was at -3 when I posted, so I just wanted people to know it was helpful to me.

Then maybe you could change "despite" to "despise". Or better yet, "I am very reluctant to..."

There's also [this]( from Wikipedia. Bitcoin is much worse for bad people than the US dollar is.

This is me, and many others I know.

My bank doesn't support instant verification. I've been waiting 5 days for the deposits Coinbase made to show up. In that time, BitCoin's gone up in value over 10%.

No, just curious. And I thought others might be as well. If I walk into a bank and change $100 into Euros, then in two weeks trade those Euros back for $105, does that count as $5 of taxable income? It just seems odd. But I guess you could say I bought Euros with the $$, then bought $$ with the money and made a profit.
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:34:55
Thanks. I'll give Coinbase two more days to verify my bank account, and then opt for this.

I'm not asking for personal advice. I only have one and I'm not planning on selling it for fiat -- at least not any time in the next 10 years. Just curious. And I figured that some people would have sold theirs and would have the answer.

My bank (US) charges $25 for domestic wire transfers, and $50 for international. Added to your $15 fee, that's almost 10% of what I was planning on investing.

You could have people asking for refunds even if they love the product, because they'd rather have the Bitcoin back if the price doubles. "It was worth .1BTC when BTC=$500USD, but it's not worth .1BTC when BTC=$1000USD," they'll think. "The value of the item has not doubled like the value of what I traded for it has, so I want my goods back."
I'm with the above: pick a specific policy and stick with it. If you do that a few times and lose USD (which you will, both lose and gain), then you can point to those and say, "Look, this is our policy, sometimes we gain in USD, sometimes we lose in it, but we're committed to treating Bitcoin as a real currency, and you wouldn't demand more USD back if it dropped relative to the Euro after your purchase".
