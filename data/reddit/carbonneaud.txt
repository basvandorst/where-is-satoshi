A better metaphor would be "If you stored your money in someone else's glove box and they got their car stolen" would you expect to get it back.

There is a some convenience to having the merchants automatically bill your credit cards when the time comes.  How do bitcoin users automate monthly renewals?

Will the bit store allow us to submit apps that were rejected by the appstore?

You're right.  Found a more accurate way to compare the volumes than bitcoinwisdom. The 1 year chart here  show similar global volumes for the nov spike and this one.

We need this price/volume comparison chart over 1y to work but it's broken.  It also doesn't show the last few days for some reason.

Great app.  Here’s some feedback:
-When you switch back into the app (after being idle or after using another app), you should automatically refresh balances
- lightning refill: please indicate how much btc is available to refill. I had to cancel and swap back to BTC wallet a few times to memorize how much I had available that I want to refill with.  In this amount, also deduct the on chain fee that would be required for the refill.  I wanted to fill the lightning wallet with everything I had in my BTC wallet but it said I didn’t have enough funds.  I had to try a few times with increasingly smaller amounts until it worked.
