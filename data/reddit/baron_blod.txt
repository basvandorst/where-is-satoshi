More than bitcoin when (as you used the same word) it flops.
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:02:50
around 250k

about 1%
very comfortable,
have been spending bitcoins since they hit the usd 100 mark

quite surprised that linkedin, yahoo and ask.com are rated higher than the biggest porn site tbh.

Driving a car (correct me if I'm wrong here) - 16 yo is responsible enough.
Getting sent (to possibly die or kill another person in a) war - 18 will do
Drinking beer (and drunk-texting exes) - got to wait three more years!
this makes no sense to me, it absolutely seems to be in the wrong order. On the other hand my university educations would probably be a bit more comfortable if I weren't drunk three days a week

well, atleast the roof looks almost watertight

obviously you shouldn't even dare questioning the bitcoin circlejerk...

my first transaction turned 4 years old a couple of days ago :)

I'm not pretending that I would be able to write the original draft/whitepaper, but what exactly is so hard about implementing SHA256 hashing?

I think you could answer this without knowing anything about venezuelan currency...

Bah, I can't really complain. Did not get rich in any way or form - but got quite a bit of Lego from my bitcoins :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:47:31
hehe, I sold most of my coins at the peak! 27 usd per coin iirc.
Maybe I should have bought back in again at some point..

not going to come with a number, but I'd say invest the same percentage that you would in a new pharmaceutical company before the phase I trials are completed.
Insanely high risk, but still a chance (however tiny) of making a stellar profit.

Honestly, bitcoin will never -ever- gain any significant share of the global economy if it keeps getting used mainly in "sketchy" areas.
I (and most of the world) categorize sketchy areas as guns, drugs and prostitution.

I agree that the price probably will rise as the difficulty increases.
What makes me think the prices will fall in the short term is seeing that there is a lot more bitcoins put up for sale than I've ever seen before. For bitcoin this is not a bad thing as a gradual increase in price (or somewhat stable price) is much better than the heavy fluctuations we've seen the last months.
Not really good for the people that bought at 250, though :o

1. Averaging your buy price will make you able to avoid paying too much for your coins (buying on top).
2. If bitcoin loose it's appeal for some reason, you have an exit strategy.
3. Easier to spend $10 every day than $3650 today
Claiming that your option _is_ better requires you to _know_ what is happening the next &lt;random period of time&gt;

If you couldn't care less about loosing 100k, then invest 100k.
If, however, you'll notice a 2k investement - then bitcoin is not for you. This is an extremely high risk investment. EXTREMELY high risk.

There are plenty of known flaws in bitcoin...
If you don't consider the things like problems with blocks over 1mb and the 51% attack vector as flaws - I don't know what could possibly be categorized as a flaw?
@_date: 2013-10-19 23:37:42
Was only pointing out that your statement of "Less sense then just buying all you can afford and holding." Has got some severe flaws.

My _guess_ after following the markets pretty closely since btc broke $40 is that it will stabilize at around 75 for a while.
To me it seems that there has been a continual increase in bitcoins available for sale. And it is also pretty evident that the daily volume is increasing both in terms of bitcoins and usd.
To me this means that the tradevalue will be more stable in the short term future. If bitcoins gets more widely adopted we will once again see a sharp rise in the value of btc.
I don't really hold any notable amount of btc, but might buy when it hits 75 (or when people panic and sell for 30 again).

"funny thing" is that the poor sods that have spent bitcoins on that hardware is even more unlikely to receive their goods now that BFL surely will go bankrupt (assuming they would ship anyways)

uhh... the 15% is the card transactions..

I think you missed my point.

our gold reserve was sold several years ago, Norway now only has one bar of gold stored.
@_date: 2013-05-07 20:44:59
yup, I also remember sending my 5 btc back to the faucet a few days after I got them..
Kinda wish I didn't a couple of weeks ago :)

My last two trips to Belgium has been solely to buy their beer. Can't get their beer anywhere here in Norway, and it is well worth the trip for their magnificent beer.
