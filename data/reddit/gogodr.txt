@_date: 2018-01-29 15:16:59
I don't mean to sound rude, but if you think that most or even a representative amount of people who use Bitcoin understands how it works, you are delusional.  
People don't even understand how dollars work, and some don't even understand basic economics like trading and stuff.  
Catering to those people is what mass adoption means, and this app has that intention underneath. It's catering for people with multiple backgrounds, specially with economics. Asking someone who is good at risk assessment, diversifying investments, smart investing strategies, etc to get Wireshark, sniff a representative sample of packets, filter out common packets and see if the app only consumes and doesn't sends data is not fair. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:32:23
Yes it is open source and free to use. Creators won't get fees automatically. Anyone can get fees by running a node and charging a fee on that node transactions. People will most likely route for the lower fees tho, so if you charge a high fee and don't provide meaningful channels they will mostly avoid you and you won't get fees.

@_date: 2015-12-30 23:07:49
Bitcoin is not money, the law must be specific. Bitcoin holds value for us, but very little countries to date recognize bitcoin's value in their legal system, thus traceability linked to identity is not enforced.( contrary to bank transactions, where your country can access the data and link the movements with the identity of thr account's owner) Put your bitcoin laundering business in the country less likely to make an in depth investigation, it is hard enough to prove whose bitcoin are the bitcoin your business is receiving, without regulation it makes it completely legal and almost impossible to trace anyways.

1 and 2 are related. The work is not arbitrary. The mathematical challenge is actually the verification of transactions in a block and that verification is needed for the network to work. And the difficulty isn't arbitrary either, it is the result of the network state and how convoluted addresses can get within a block. 
3 is true but pushing a change is no easy task. You can propose any change you see fit and start using it, but everybody else needs to accept said change and start using it.

Maybe it is because it is the open source community the one that participates more in Internet forums than the actual people in the software development industry, but I can assure you that if it weren't for patents and rights to the software we make for our companies, we wouldn't have a job at all.  
Not everyone likes to work for free, some do tho. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 17:18:12
Yes,  I do.  I love the open source community and have a couple of open source projects myself,  but that's just a hobby of mine. Still I Stand by what I say that you can't profit from your open source software.  That doesn't mean you can't profit from the project tho.  The only way to profit from your open source software is by charging from a service related to the software, it being maintenance, support, extra cloud based features, etc.  
You can't sell the software itself.  Since it is open source anyone can just take your source code and compile it and/or adjust/modify it to their needs. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 17:13:10
The problem here is not the patents, but the regulators who pass general patents.   Patents themselves are a good thing, because copyright on software is only to the finished product.  Say that your team developed some kind of encryption or special algorithm, copyright law won't help you there, if you want to profit from it, you need to patent it. Why not just pack it up and sell it as a black box? Performance and risk of it being reverse engineered.

Seriously..  All this coinbase hate is starting got get like the Linux communities hate for other distros..  It is not that hard to understand that with better usability you will have lower security.  In this specific scenario coinbase acting as a bank, storing your bitcoin and handling your information.  Being transparent is the only way they can handle your money without they getting in problems. If you don't like it, then stop using coinbase and while you are at it stop using any kind of bank. Because the only thing that will satisfy you is handling your own money yourself as inconvenient as it is.  
Why is coinbase more convenient than a plain bitcoin transaction? The coinbase transaction is a trusted one, which means that those transactions can be handled by coinbase and queued in the block chain reducing both transaction cost and time.

That and also the block size dispute..  Which is absurd.

@_date: 2016-02-08 13:18:35
Yes, and that's my point. It is a parallel network,not bitcoin itself. It complements bitcoin it is a really good third party service. Coinbase has 100% trust between his addresses, thus confirmed transactions are immediate in the coinbase network.   the transaction is not done until the party receiving the bitcoin can spend it. You cant spend unconfirmed bitcoin  also, it is not a second, specially for international transactions it takes at least a confirmation for the transaction to start going through the relays/nodes.   
On a side not but it isn't really that important. Paypal transaction time is immediate between paypal wallets, takes a couple of seconds when using third parties like visa or mastercard and confirms it instantly. Those merchants on the other hand have different confirmation policies for debit and credit cards. Debit being immediate, credit being 3 to 5 days.

@_date: 2016-02-07 14:36:17
No, the whole purpose of bitcoin is being able to send data that holds a value through the internet.  Personally I use coinbase because it makes transactions easier and faster and I am not an anti bank/anti system kind of guy.  I recognize a good service when I see it.   Now about this specific topic, thats news to me, i have always used my coinbase address on nitrogen sports and even gambled on last year's super bowl, i will have to see what is going on. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:26:01
It was not. Paypal doesn't hold any value. It is a service similar to coinbase. The difference is that paypal doesnt work with bitcoin and coinbase does.  And using bitcoin on itself is not fast.  Transactios done with a generous donation to miners still takes minutes to get processed. From a coinbase address to another, transactions are immediate since they work with their own network on parallel. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 15:29:15
The internet is not a magic thing that can spread information from one place to another in one step. It is a network and it takes many jumps to go from A to B. The bitcoin network is a second layer on top of that, and not all nodes distribute unconfirmed transactions. ( this is because if they did nodes would be way too vulnerable to ddos attacks or table poisonings with fake transactions data )  
Most wallets are not 'listening to the network'  but they are listening to a certain set of nodes that relay the network transactions.   
So as an example: if you live in europe and in your wallet you only have european nodes(there can be many reasons for this) , when you make a transaction those nodes will receive the transaction and generate the work order, pools subscribed to those nodes ( that can be anywhere in the world) will receive those transactions in the work block and once it gets confirmed the node will mark them and integrate them in the blockchain, then subscribed clients and other nodes subscribed to that node will pick up the addresses and the nodes that receive the address for the first time will put it again on work for a second confirmation and so on.  ( that second node can be anywhere in the world too) 
@_date: 2016-02-09 15:34:21


that's what the first confirmation does. Miners do that and since they do it in bulk, it takes quite some time.

If they do that they won't get the same results and all the future blocks from the rollback and rebuild will have different fingerprint thus invalidating the network for the other parties. The blockchain itself is and still was immutable even in that example, because the rollback and 'restore' created a different instance of the blockchain, it didn't modify it.

@_date: 2018-02-20 19:04:02
You can't form a blockchain, you can fork a project. Even if the blockchain is managed by a single entity it is considered immutable because if you change an old block, later blocks  verification will fail and new blocks won't pass verification thus corrupting the whole blockchain.  SQL doesn't have that immutability feature embedded in it. It is doable with enough plsql scripts and logging tables, but it would generate a lot of overhead processing wise and storage wise.
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:39:21
Blockchain use is not exclusive to cryptocurrencies. Specially blockchain for businesses it is just to keep an immutable ledger. Say that you have a business to business relationship with 3 businesses. Those 3 can be the ones using that blockchain for sending information like request orders and tracking of fullfilment. That would be a private blockchain that is not a currency and the only participants are those 3 businesses.   Basically it is a new database system with multiple actors.

@_date: 2018-02-20 00:24:06
Because of the current market bubble. Businesses rush into implementing some kind of blockchain technology not to get the benefits of actually using blockchain, but the benefits of having something new, thus making the business more attractive to investors.  Creating a ERC20 token can be done with as little as 5$, 15 minutes of learning and 5 to actually deploy it.   Real businesses that implement blockchain use real systems like IBM's hyperledger Fabric and build blockchain systems that are not dependant from any cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:06:50
You are comparing different things. You will most likely pay fees if you want to transfer from your bank to a different bank, and if you don't maybe the banks have an agreement to not charge fees in between them. The exact same behavior can be replicated since banks and cryptos are not mutually exclusive. You can have a bank that works on cryptos. Kind of like coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:08:40
No. I really doubt anyone would willfully relay your transaction for so little. With LN transaction fees will be lower and the transaction time will be virtually instant but it won't be free.
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:16:52
He is wrong tho. The wrong part is where he thinks that a blockchain must have a proof of work consensus algorithm. There are many consensus algorithms and some of them are centralized, meaning that a single entity can be the one going all the validation and it still is a blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:50:59


Not all actors need to have the same roles, some can have the only role of monitoring and controlling that all the transactions are valid. Usually, this is done traditionally by external parties like certification businesses like ISO issuers.

What if it is a little distributed system that gets added value if all the transactions are immutable like with blockchain. An excellent example can be a supply chain where all the parties involved have to make their desitions based on historical information from their other parties.   And to ensure integrity a certification authority can have a custom rol in the blockchain. The actors being the suppliers, the consumers, the transporters, and the certification authority or authorities.

While it is true that you should never pay the ransom of ransomware, this iteration of wannacry came with the decryption tools embedded in the virus instead of being behind a payload download trigger.

[Marcus Hutchins found an easily exploitable kill switch within Wannacry](   
I only knew about it because I saw a AMArequest, but I don't remember on which sub, on which Marcus himself commented.   
There are no step by step guides on how to fix it (on the reddit thread he said that he was going to publish it, but he wanted his 5 seconds of fame first, or something along those lines), but the procedure is all about reversing the virus and it is not really that hard.   
Basically the flaw is in the payment check system. the virus sends a requests to a server to check the payment instead of doing it itself via the bitcoin protocol. So, you can spoof the payment check and kill the virus(releasing the files).

Coinbase is the best bitcoin solution there is right now. It haves the wallet which is more like a debit card as coinbase holds your bitcoin and you just authorize transactions or take out your bitcoin on request.  
But also, it offers you a vault system which gives you control of your keys via multi signing. So you don't have to worry about coonbase stealing your bitcoin.  
For coinbase clients the transactions are not even done through the bitcoin network, and transactions are instant, but it also accepts external payments and withdrawals which are done through the bitcoin network and take at least a confirmation.

Yes, they can stop you from sending a transaction, but thats all what they can do with your bitcoin. They can't use it on their own, they need both your identification and authorization to sign a transaction.

yes, that's what I think so too.
but later on, when people see that if they value BCC more it will hurt BTC price, I fear that they will stop valuing BCC and it will go down.  Or it will stay and hurt the BTC value (because of the injection of value in the cryptocurrencies system)

I had this same question some time ago and some users recommended me bitpay. It is incredibly easy to use and I have it both in my phone and my desktop.
