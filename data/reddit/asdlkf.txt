Fees will go to (nearly) zero:
Once lightning is in place, the vast majority of transactions will not require blockchain interaction at all; the remaining transactions per second will be less than bitcoin's capacity, so transactions will be quick without large fees. 
Bitcoin can sustain 5 tx per second right now.
BCH can sustain 63 tx per second. 
VISA can sustain 20,000 TX per second. 
USD can sustain unlimited TX per second. 
Neither BTC or BCH are functional at scale right now. We don't require a blocksize increase; we require transactions that don't require the blockchain for successful transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:27:31
just "toshi". 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:19:25
did you set your transaction fees to less than $0.50? 
Because I moved 0.2BTC from an exchange to my wallet yesterday, paid $0.75 in fees, and transaction had 22 confirmations in 45 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:48:15
what I mean is that there's no such thing as a court-ordered transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:51:13
1) compared to *some* competing crypto, btc is more decentralized, compared to others, it is less. 
For example, BCH (BitcoinCash) wants to increase the blocksize significantly. This would mean that storing a complete copy of the blockchain would require multiple TB of spare storage space (as compared to 150GB for Bitcoin right now). As this grows through the years, it would become impractical or not cost effective to either store or download a copy of the BCH blockchain for an individual. Many people around the world either can't afford to posess enough disk storage, or don't have an internet connection that can realistically distribute a multi-TB database. This would lead to many people using online verification systems, which would inherantly be centralizing that authority. 
As it stands, with bitcoin, anyone can go download a wallet, create a private/public key pair, and send/receive bitcoin on (almost) any electronic device. Simmilarly, anyone can download mining software and use whatever computational power they have to mine those coins. 
That is not the case with all cryptos. 
2) etherium is a big contender, with it's smart contracts system. 
3) In the short term, yes. In the long term, almost certainly no. The question is, how short is "short term" and how long is "long term". Almost every currency ever devised has failed in the past. Just because USD is doing well, doesn't mean it won't fail. Eventually, on a long enough timeline, Bitcoin will be as valuable as the zimbabe dollar when uber-omega-ultra-coin comes out and everyone flocks to the new big thing. 
I think realistically, btc is going to be king for at least the next 5 years, probably much longer. 
4) Bitcoin could change the proof-of-stake, but doing so would require a hard fork and whatever came out of that hard fork would no longer be bitcoin, just as etherium is no longer etherium classic. If mining bitcoin didn't require computational resources and electrical power, everyone would mine it. It's healthy for mining to require recurring resources. 
5) I can't speak to this... idk?

It's not like cash for 2 important reasons:
1) No government can "make more" of it. When ever the us government prints another trillion dollars in bank notes, that takes a fractional value out of the pockets of every single person holding USD. 
2) no person can be forced to pay it. Unless I hand over my private key or issue a payment order from my wallet, no government or thief can steal my property. (hacks on the exchanges aside...).

2 things:
1) current geo-stationary orbit satellites are ~35,700km. Pinging a satellite, round trip, is *at least* 4*35,700 = 142,000km. 
2) 142,000km / 300,000km/s = 0.473s == 473ms. 
3) musk's constellation will be approx 380km in altitude... 4*380 = 1580km round trip for ping. 1580/300,000 = 0.005 = 5ms...
so yea... instead of 473ms base, 5ms base. it'll be faster.

@_date: 2017-12-25 20:36:16
I'm not an expert, so here's my poorly explained answers:
1) segwit and lightning
SegWit (short for Segregated Witness) is a process that allows for smaller amounts of data per transaction to hit the blockchain in a single block. This allows for more transactions to fit inside a single 1MB block, and will allow for more transactions per second to be processed by the bitcoin network. 
The Lightning Network is an abstraction layer for bitcoin that allows for direct or indirect transfers from wallet to wallet, without ever touching the bitcoin blockchain, by opening up reusable channels. This has the effect of allowing user A to send tiny amounts (or large amounts) of bitcoin to user B without incurring per-transaction fees. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, this transaction doesn't need to be validated by the bitcoin blockchain consensus algorithm to be completed.
The underlying thing you need to know about segwit and lightning: 
SegWit will allow more transactions per second globally, by making blocks fit more transactions. 
Lightning will allow exponentially more transactions by making repeated transactions only require a single blockchain interaction, instead of N interactions. 
2) Yes, there are some scaling solutions coming, but right now, the effort is focused on solutions that do not require a hard fork. 
3) no idea
4) Every 10 minutes, (on average), a block is sealed that contains the previous 10 minutes worth of transaction history. Miners perform the work of cryptographically "sealing" that block to both guarantee the block's authenticity, authoritative status, and transaction authorizations. 
Wallets send "send" messages to nodes which distribute the wallets' message into the mempool. 
Nodes in the bitcoin network are able to submit transactions to the mempool. 
Miners in the bitcoin network collect those fees (and the newly minted coins) as rewards for processing wallet transactions. 
Nodes can be miners, miners can be nodes, but nodes and miners can both operate independently. 
5a) I don't see any particularly glaring security issues with bitcoin. 
5b) decentralization will solve itself once more merchants and consumers can directly transact with bitcoin. There will be no need to exchange into FIAT so there will be no need for exchanges, so there will be no centralization. 
5c) fees will go down when segwit and lightning (and other technologies) allow the bitcoin blockchain to catch up and stay caught up. As long as global bitcoin transaction processing power per second is higher than the number of transactions being submitted per time, there is no reason fees need to be more than 1 satoshi. 
5d) lightning can confirm a transaction in under a second. fast enough?

Musk will be launching his constellation late 2018, then we'll have low-latency satellite available globally.

i'm doing simmilar. I took out large loans to buy btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:21:39
I won't address the amount;
what I will tell you is that I can borrow money from a bank at 8% interest per year. In the weeks since I borrowed the money, I'm up 177%. 
when BTC hits 25k, I'll sell enough of it to cover the loan, and I'll have 0 debt and a bunch of bitcoins left over.

I think it makes sense to mine past break even; even getting $1 of bitcoin for $1 in electricity is a good deal when bitcoin goes back up. (Assuming mine/hodl, not mine/insta-sell)
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:00:55
$1 in electricity costs me less than $1 in bitcoin. 
Transaction fees, exchange rates, exchange fees, taxes, etc...
My break even is about $1.08. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:36:57
No. Simply no.
Bitcoin's "value" is what the world collectively believes it is worth buying at. 
If it costs me $20,000 in electricity to mine 1 coin, that does not mean 1 coin is worth $20,000. If it costs me 0.01$ to mine 1 coin, that does not mean it's worth 1 cent either. 
The "value" of bitcoin is that collectively the world believes that $170 a coin is a fair value of exchange in perportion to the people who believe they can sell for more or buy for less. It's 100% regulated by supply and demand.
The computational costs only regulate the minting rate and the profitability of deciding whether to mine or not. If it costs $180 in electricity to mine a coin that no one will pay more than $170 for, then you probably don't want to mine the coin. If it costs $5 to mine the coin that you think you can sell to someone else for $170, then there is a profit motive to realize a gain of $165 by spending electricity to create and then sell a coin. 
ASICs in the market have nothing to do with the 'value' of what people think a coin is worth in the long run. It simply means that the difficulty is going to go up signifigantly so people with video cards will see their electricity costs raise to a point where it's not profitiable for them to mine any more. This is in no way going to steer the valuation of coins as a whole; it's simply going to reward the ASIC miners for their forward thinking and technological ingenuity and adaptation of new technology and penalize CPU/GPU miners for failing to keep up with the joneses. The price of coins is not correlated with computational costs. The minting rate is correlated with computational costs. 
Even then, the mining rate is self-regulating via the difficulty corrections to stabilize supply and demand. 
If you want to buy a coin, you have to buy it from someone who has one, and, unlike FIAT currency or gold, you can't convince a government to print more money or invest in technology to allow you to extract more gold from the earth. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins (minus the ones that were destroyed/lost/etc...). There can easily be more fiat or commodities. 
For that reason alone, supply is more tightly controlled in bitcoins than in any other commodity or fiat that I can think of.
