Yeah, that's the part that doesn't seem logical.  If you believe USDT isn't worth the $1, and you believe it strongly enough you want to sell and get out of Bitcoin - what sense does it make to sell the BTC FOR USDT?  You should see people wanting more and more USDT (eg higher price) for the same amount of BTC if people were truly afraid of USDT.  If you thought the dollar was going to collapse, you would be buying stores of value (in the past that would be gold for example), you wouldn't panic sell all your assets and try to be holding MORE dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:42:05
Wouldn't that prove that all the worry that the market is vastly influenced by Tether can be put to rest?  If they had their most rapid expansion, more Tether being produced than ever before (I'm not sure if they did, just saying if that's true), and the price WAS NOT affected doesn't that prove that it's other market forces at work on the price and it isn't Tether that can make things go up or down whenever they want?

They love it when it drops down for 2 hours and then everybody buys and it goes back up even higher.  Nobody likes when it's down for coming up on a month (well, unless you sold a bunch of call options - in which case you want it to go lower so they expire worthless for the buyer).

In which case there would be no scam - people were given USDT in exchange for giving them BTC.  Later people gave them back the USDT in exchange for receiving BTC.  That 1:1 backing (that they hold assets equal to outstanding USDT) is what people want isn't it?

That last part is key - they screw you for a few hundred when you're young and now for life you won't deal with them.  I feel the same way about Virgin Mobile and I've held to never using them again.  (relative was on an unlimited plan, then suddenly they bill the credit card on file for hundreds of dollars instead of the $30 normal charge, when I call to ask them about it they say the 'card was declined for the $30, so it reverted to charging pay per use of 25 cents per text received or sent', amazing how the card didn't work for $30, yet the same day the $30 fee should have gone on there it successfully charged over $100 in per usage fees instead)

No, the article itself states they were subpoenaed in early December.  BEFORE the run up that Bitcoin had in December.  Typically companies don't say 'They're on to us! I know, let's ramp up what we were doing that drew attention!  Then after 2 months we'll arbitrarily stop doing it.'

Yeah, only in hindsight, when/if it's back at 20k at some point in the future you will look back and say 'Well, should have bought back then.'  There's no way to KNOW, truly KNOW, if it's done going up or done going down.

Having been around for the dot com bubble and not just reading about it somewhere, I can tell you I do NOT remember any point where it fell by over 50% and then recovered to keep going onwards and upwards.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:53:44
If they were doing that though - why has the price been dropping?  If they already decided to just 'make up USDT', once they started, there would be no reason to stop until they're caught.  If anything you'd just keep printing larger and larger amounts of it, and driving the price of Bitcoin up higher and higher until you're caught (and once you go down that road it's inevitable - you will be caught eventually)

Ledger doesn’t either, the scam is that the paper itself was put in there after somebody initialized a genuine ledger.

Let me tell you how that works - you check Bitcoin, see it's up so much that what started as 1% is suddenly 90% of your investments, meanwhile your top mutual fund which was top rated for years is down 10% this year (ARGH FAIRX!), so you do what people say you should. Sell the bitcoin, buy more of what's losing you money.  What happens?  The thing you sold goes up more, the thing that was losing - loses more.

I know what you mean.  Although someone mentions Mnuchin further down and I have to kind of agree with them.  While it is great news that the House Minority Leader likes Bitcoin - certainly better than him towing the line of 'it's worthless, made out of thin air', he can only make legislation beneficial to Bitcoin (or at least avoid making legislation that is harmful to it) with the support of a bunch of other people - he can't change things by himself.  Mnuchin meanwhile can just make regulations as he goes, and try to force people to comply (if he really needs it, he can just go have an executive order signed, although he would try to use his regulatory bank powers first).

That's just it isn't it.  People are going 'haha, you bought at ATH, what were you thinking', but yet look at all the people that post things like 'oh, why didn't I buy more at 200, 1000, 4000, 8000, etc.'  The truth is only in hindsight do you really know if it's going to keep going and leave you without any, or if it's about to dive.

A churner is somebody that opens a card, and then spends enough for the qualifying offer (eg I had a card one time offer me $500 in cash back for spending $1,500 in the first 3 months once).  Usually to be considered a churner you would then have to cancel the card after a few months, and open a new one again in 2-3 years when you qualify for a bonus offer again.  Most offers require more spending though eg $500 back for spending $3,000 in which case buying on Coinbase quickly got him the minimum spending amount required without him actually having to spend it on consumer stuff.
@_date: 2019-07-03 04:36:17
Umm, I see it as quite the opposite.  You think if they really went after Bitcoin they couldn't do some substantiate damage to the price of it?  Sure they can't stop the underlying transactions - the ability to send Bitcoins from one address to another if both addresses are unknown,  but if they were to declare 'nobody is allowed to accept Bitcoin' and do it in conjunction with others like the EU it would do substantial damage.
That they are afraid of Facebook's Libra means they have the same fears about all other cryptocurrencies - it's just that they can stop that one while they still haven't figured out how they want to try to stop others.  Once Facebook had millions of people with cryptocurrency of their own it would become a lot more politically damaging to try and take it away from people - which seems to be where they are heading by the statements they are making.

Trump (running to twitter): Paul Ryan almost killed the Republican Party. Weak, ineffective &amp; stupid

Just because 1 person has 3 BTC, another has 5 BTC, another has 2 BTC doesn't mean Coinbase has each one of those on a separate address on their end.  On their back end they could have all of that in 1 address with 10 BTC in it for example (in practice the amounts are obviously much higher)  They maintain a pool of BTC for active withdrawals, and cold storage for the rest - you would only need to migrate over a portion of total reserves to allow for segwit enabled withdrawals/outgoing.  Meanwhile, accepting segwit deposits/incoming would only REDUCE congestion and lower fees since those would be transactions coming in via segwit instead of the current congested method.

I think so too - actually if anything these kind of threads scare me because it starts to show the euphoric stage which presages a drop.  On the other hand - a few years ago I never could have imagined 10k, and I think I would kick myself MORE if it goes from 10k to 20k and I sold than I would if I don't sell and it were to go back to 1k.

Shorting is when you sell something you don't own and then buy it back to replace it from wherever you borrowed it when you sold it.  When you sell something you OWN, and then buy back cheaper that's just being a trader.

That system frankly sounds awful.  Somebody is taxed as if they made 2.87% to 5.39% on all the money they have - even in a savings account that's only paying a fraction of that?  Can you at least document that you aren't getting that much in interest and get a refund when you file taxes?

It pains me to say this (since I disagree on so many other things) but the Republicans do seem to better understand the issues here on this topic than the Democrats did in this particular hearing.  Not just in general cryptocurrency terms, but also in specific Facebook Libra terms like 'will you control who can and can't have a wallet based on how you feel about them', 'just how much tracking can you do', 'how centralized will this be', etc.

Turning on Segwit to me means say I have 1 BTC on Coinbase, and I want to move it to a Trezor, I can give Coinbase a destination address of the segwit enabled address on my Trezor and it would do it at little to no fee and be done in a few minutes.

No, percentages are what matters.  If you had $1,000 to invest when it was at say $230, then you got a little over 4 BTCs only for it to fall right after.  If you paid $1,000 when it was nearly $20,000 you may have only got 0.05 BTC but that's still the same amount invested either way and the same amount of dollars lost or gained if it then moves 30% down or 30% up from there.

The new tax bill in the house does cap that at 25% though, and was later amended to cap that at 9% for the first $75,000 in income (the senate bill instead lets you deduct 23% of your income).  That's why he mentioned the new tax bill.  MOST people however would be much better served just avoiding short term trading, and selling when it's a long term gain taxed at 0% or 15% depending on which tax bracket you are in.

You appear to be operating on the belief that for every dollar in market cap somebody has put a dollar in, but that isn’t how it works.  Say you own 1 BTC, somebody agrees to pay you $100 for .1 of it - that makes bitcoin worth $1000 per coin - now somebody pays you $1,000 for the next 0.1, at this point two people have spent only $1,100 total, you have $1,100 in your bank account, and your 0.8 BTC you have left is being shown to you as worth $8000.  All with only $1,100 actually being spent by anyone.  Meanwhile the guy that bought your 0.1 first now is seeing a ten fold return in the value of his 0.1.  What you have is not what somebody else put in - there is not a “loser for every winner”.

Keep in mind that was their statement back in August I think?  So at the time they felt they could promise to let people withdraw, but they would have to determine later about trading.  1 month, 2 months later they decided yeah, let's do the whole shebang, withdraw, buy, sell, trade.  That is making the decision at a later date, since it was written back in August, the decision was made a month or two later (according to articles they finally made the determination a month ago and notified employees they were not to be buying or selling BCH in the next month or risk being fired.)

Shorting is a fairly simple concept.  You borrow shares from a broker, sell at one price, and hope it goes down.  Later you buy back at whatever the price has gone to (hopefully by your choice at the time of your choosing) and return them to the broker.  There are no exchanges with high volume that loan out customer’s Bitcoins to others on loan - there is no true shorting.  The closest anybody gets is futures but that is betting on what Bitcoin will go to - not actually buying or selling actual Bitcoins.

That is talking about reporting that somebody else received that amount of property from you, not that you aren't taxable on under that amount.  It's so that somebody else, who's receiving property and not reporting the income on those sales can be tracked down easier.  It's not saying you're relieved of the burden of paying on gains under $600, it's saying that if you go over $600 you have to file additional reports that will be used to make sure the person receiving the payment is reporting the property they are receiving properly.  See the part where it says 'to the IRS AND to the payee', that's because you're filling out a tax form to report the income they received from you - just like your employer has to fill out a W2 for you if you're an employee who receives wages, which is why you're sending it to both them AND to the person you sent the property to.

Are you calling them liars when they say they specialize in investigations?  I mean, they ARE made up of a former director for the FBI and three federal judges, so if they say they know investigations...why should I believe you over them?  Do you acknowledge that they checked the bank accounts and verified the amount of USD in them equaled the amount of Tether at least?
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:28:44
This is reminding me of conversations from the crash where people were SURE, absolutely SURE USDT was a fraud, and 'get out now, it won't hold par much longer!' (like this one:  ).  Here we are half a year later, and it's still holding par despite people withdrawing huge sums of money from the market.
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:28:57
They drove the price up by....let me see if I get this right...buying a lot of Bitcoin?  That's not a scam.  The only way it becomes a scam is if they told people who were selling their Bitcoins 'here, have this tether, it's 1:1 with the USD' and then they didn't follow through with that.  Obviously that didn't happen - and you can bet withdraws were pretty heavy in the last half year of crytocurrencies falling.  If the plan was 'take everybody's Bitcoin, then run off without paying out' well, they appear to have forgotten the 'run off' part because instead they stayed and somehow had the money to pay out to people exactly what they said they would (and keep Tether pegged 1:1).
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:25:08
Yeah, tell me about it.  The ones I sold went up, the ones I kept went down.  Truth is - you never know what anything will do - and even those 'professionals' who manage billions really have no idea either (as evidenced by their poor performance this year with billion+ funds).  Problem is - if you sell and it goes up, everybody says 'Should have rode it out, should have stayed in.'  If you stay in then it keeps going down and everybody says 'You should have got out when it started performing badly.'

An audit can take years, and involves huge sums of fees (which is partly why it takes years).  This isn't BS, it's just it set out to only do 1 thing - and it does that 1 thing.  Prove that the ones that say they don't have USD to back up the Tethers are wrong.  Not that those same people can't come up with other conspiracy theories as well (some of which are pretty laughable if you step back and look at them, my favorite being the - 'oh, they just borrowed a billion dollars from a buddy for a bit until the investigators confirmed the money in the accounts, then logged into their account and did a bank transfer of the billion back to their buddy, and told their buddy thanks for the billion')

Seriously? You just used the words 'the law fir(m) affirmed' and then followed that with 'which means nothing'.  A little bit of common sense in relation to what you just said would expose which of the two of us are telling the lies - you think the law firm made up of the former director of the FBI and 3 federal judges that specializes in 'providing legal, investigative and monitoring services to organizations around the world' came back with 'As part of the Engagement, FSS was able to confirm the U.S. Dollar (“USD”) balances in accounts	owned or controlled by Tether at its banks', and you think 'that means nothing'?
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:09:27
It's not an audit.  It was commissioned for 1 thing and only 1 thing - to prove that on a random date (that Tether would not be advised of ahead of time) Tether had as much in bank accounts in USD as they do in outstanding Tether.  It set out only to prove 1 thing - that the people claiming they printed a bunch of 'fake Tethers' without USD to back it up are wrong and that the money is there to match it 1:1. (Albeit you will still have people that are stuck in the mindset of 'I'm not wrong! Let me think of the myriad of other conspiracies I can come up with instead' so it isn't like this will end the FUD.  No amount of proof would end the FUD.)

Market manipulation to what end?  You're giving out something you say is valued at 1 Tether to 1 USD when the price is 15-20k per Bitcoin.  Then you follow through with that commitment by having exchanges actually let people withdraw billions from their accounts over the next few months.  Meanwhile the value has dropped to almost 6k.  Do you not realize that makes no sense?  Here, let me say it another way - what if I told you I would give you 20k of my made up coin RIGHT NOW for 1 Bitcoin from you and at any time you are free to request I exchange it for the exact same number of US dollars.  You take me up on the deal.  In 3 months we drop another 2k, the Bitcoin you sold me went from being worth 6k to 4k yet I actually follow through and send you 20k in exchange for the 20k of the coin I made up.

So now instead of hearing 'Tether doesn't have the money on deposit like they say they do' people will just start saying 'Well, Tether's BANK can't be trusted to have the money they say they do'?

Tether's been exposed? As what?  Are you referencing the whole 'Tether drove up price! There were no real buyers!' nonsense?  Think about it logically for just a minute.  You believe they printed a bunch of Tether, gave out 15-20k in Tether in exchange for a stranger giving them 1 Bitcoin.  Then they turned around when people were panicking, and let people withdraw 15-20k in cash by turning in that Tether at a Tether supported exchange while they meanwhile sat there with the Bitcoin worth 6-10k.  What kind of an idiotic scam is it that you give people twice what something is worth?  If Tether had stopped allowing withdraws it might have been a theory that had legs, but they didn't - they let people withdraw that money on Bitcoin's long fall over the last half a year.

That's the point of USDT.  You deposit USD and receive USDT - the place that does that transaction has to fulfill the legal requirements, you use the USDT to trade on exchanges (and since it's USDT and not USD the myriad of exchanges don't have to redundantly do the same requirements), and then you deposit USDT and withdraw USD.  If you could never turn in USDT and get USD then nobody would accept USDT in exchange for selling their Bitcoin.

Umm, what you are asking for is precisely what this law firm affirmed today.  They were given permission to know what the balance was at the bank, picked a random day to contact the bank, then looked up the amount of Tether, and affirmed that they matched.  It doesn't take years to do that, and it's what was released today. An audit on the other hand is far more involved and would take years and is a lot more than just 'do they have the money on hand to keep tether 1:1'.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:48:47
That's easy - the accounting firm would say 'No, we don't want to JUST do that, if you want us, it will be a few years, and you will pay us for those years of work.'  The law firm however was willing to simply verify that USD matches outstanding Tether - their primary business isn't in taking a few years to do a complete audit so they don't try to direct things in that direction.

More specifically, one of the more popular places that supports it is  .  It's pretty much pegged to the dollar 1:1, so much so that even if somebody came along and wanted to cash in 1 million in tether to USD it would only cause it to dip to 98 cents on the dollar momentarily.

I personally don't trust, or believe CW, but I wonder how much the judge was influenced by not knowing Bitcoin terms.  Eg the judge says (in that court document somebody else linked here) Wright offered conflicting information by at one point claiming he had the Bitcoins encrypted, but at another time referring to what was encrypted as 'the keys to the Bitcoins' - to the judge that was a lie because to him Bitcoins and the keys to move the Bitcoin are totally different things.  To most people in the Bitcoin community though the keys ARE the Bitcoins.  Then later the document says Wright seemed - 'not upset' that he had lost billions by losing the keys and that there's no way Wright would have encrypted it in a way that could allow him to lose billions.  What crazy schemes have other people done on here out of paranoia of somebody hacking their computer, so they encrypt things and make sure it's not on a normal computer?  As far as being upset - people pretend not to be upset when they either lose or sell or spend, that's normal.  'Sure I lost them but they were only worth $10 at the time', 'Sure I spent what would now be $100 million on a pizza, but I didn't know that at the time so I'm not upset', etc.
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:49:09
So you believe the exchanges (linked to Tether and knowing it isn't actually backed with real money if that were the case) have been just 'giving away' billions in USD in exchange for debiting 'fake' Tethers out of people's exchange accounts over the past half year's drop?

If you can afford an ASIC miner then storage is most certainly NOT a factor.  At 1MB blocks, the maximum increase in size would be about 52GB a year, if every year from now you were to increase the blockchain by 50% a year (1.5MB, then 2.25MB, 3.375MB, etc.) in 10 years at maximum you'd be looking at 3TB of data.  Mind you - even at today's costs 3TB of storage is hardly anything, just imagine in 10 years.  They already have SSDs in the 3.5" form factor that can store 60TB - and in 10 years those even larger ones will be affordable compared to the price of an Antminer S9 or such.

It does show that all those people that were so sure Tether was made up, and there were no cash reserves in 2017 - that Tether was pumping the market with 'fake money' that wasn't backed up with cash - were wrong.  Even the NY AG states their problems started in 2018, and with the access they apparently have to Tether's financial records if Tether had been doing anything shady in 2017 you can bet it would be in the AG's report.

The whole “Tether isn’t really backed by cash” thing started during the bull run of 2017.  Even the NY AG thing says Bitfinex’s actual problem started in 2018.  At least this proves they really did have cash reserves, weren’t just making up USDT, and the run of 2017 wasn’t Tether’s doing (afterall, the NY AG has been looking extensively at their financials and clearly would have no problem saying publicly if Tether had done that in 2017 to add a few more charges to the list).

Yeah, I don't see how somebody could be ignorant of the difference between 'this is how much was traded over a continuous 3 month period' and 'this is how much was sold in a concentrated large dump, a month of waiting, then another large dump at once, followed by another wait and large dump' unless they were intentionally trying to pretend there is no difference.
If you get 36" of rain over a 3 month period - you're ok.  If you go 3 months with no rain, and then on one day you get 36" - you better watch out - there's probably going to be severe flooding.  There is a difference between 'continuous over 3 months' and 'over a period of 3 months he sold xxxx amount'.
If he sold 400 a day, everyday, for 3 months - it would never have impacted the market like it did with him selling 6k, waiting, selling 6k again, waiting, selling 6k again - wiping out the order book again and again.

He didn't sell over a 3 month period evenly.  He sold in bursts, and didn't even spread it around to different exchanges.  Let's take GDAX, if you had 13k bitcoins that you wanted to sell RIGHT NOW, all in one large batch, you would drive the order book down to $2,600.  You'd cause a panic that would tank the price on other exchanges.  If you then waited a month, and suddenly put 13k out there all on the same day and exchange you'd cause the same thing again.  This goes for high value, low share count stocks too - if I suddenly decided to put 1,000 share of BRK-A up for sale at market price all in 1 go, the price would absolutely nosedive.  That's why you arrange private sells when you have a large quantity of an asset that you want to sell at maximum value.

That's really 100% dependent on you.  If your set price is 8.5k, and it hits that, your buy goes through, are you going to panic and sell if it were to drop lower?  What if it hits 8, 7, 6?  Panic and sell?  The opposite counts too.  Say it hits 8.5, you don't buy, then it starts going back up, it hits 9, do you accept that you missed the chance and jump in or do you say 'I'll wait...' then watch as it maybe goes back up to 10, 11, 12, etc. then be exactly like the guy that said he sold at $700, kept waiting to buy in, finally bought in at 18.5k. 
Tl;dr - Do you believe long term that it is going to be worth something, or worth nothing?  If you believe nothing - then don't buy at that price you had in mind.  If long term, you believe it's going to be higher - quit trying to time the market, timing the market almost never works for most people, and you probably will not be the exception, just don't spend more than you can lose if you are wrong.

There's a difference between trusting somebody, and somebody stealing from you.  If you're a cashier, you can't just take from the register because they trusted you with money.  That's still wrong.
Having the Mt Gox guy say your Bitcoin are gone, they were stolen, I don't have them anymore, then when Bitcoin goes up saying 'oh look at that, found 200k of them' only to push for having your property sold off at a higher rate, and keeping the difference for himself is just.....people have the right to be angry that their coins are being sold off in big dumps, tanking the value of the coins that weren't stolen from them, while at the same time being told they won't be given any of the gains in the value of the property taken from them - but instead that it'll go to the guy who originally claimed he lost them.

Well that's just it. You never know what will or won't go back up.  There are people that were CERTAIN, absolutely CERTAIN Bitcoin would never hit $1,000 again after it went to $1,000 and then back down to $200.  There are now people that are CERTAIN, absolutely CERTAIN it will never hit $20,000 again.  It's up to each person as to what stresses them more.  
I know for me, selling it, and then having it go up would be worse to me than holding onto it and having it go down - that's why I'm still in. I got out on the stock, and I regretted getting out at the wrong time way more than any regret on getting in at the wrong time.  Ask yourself - if you hold, and it goes back down the same 80% down that it did back in 2013, that would leave it at 4k (no guarantee it stops there of course, but then again, same goes the other way - no guarantee it even drops to 4k) would you feel WORSE having stayed in OR would you feel worse selling, and then watching the news in a year and seeing something like 'Bitcoin up 1000%' and you didn't buy back in before the run back up started?

For ETFC?  Oh, I had an entry and exit.  Problem was - the exit started to look more and more unlikely as it continually dropped, rebounded back up (but less than it had dropped), then dropped again, meanwhile the financials for the company were not improving like I had expected based on research before buying in.  Just one quarter after another you heard 'things are improving' then the financials would be released and it would be a bigger loss.  Transaction volume would go up, fees collected would go up, but then they'd have another 'one off', 'just this quarter' event come up and sap away all profits and swing it into a loss again, and again.
As for Bitcoin - no, I didn't approach it with entry and exit in mind, because it wasn't an investment.  It was 'I have this spare computer hardware, I run this code that stresses my CPU a bit during downtime' (pre 2011).  As for when to sell?  When I feel like I want to use the money elsewhere - whatever it may end up being.  If it were to to go to 50k as you said - who knows - I just might sell some.  I wouldn't buy a lambo, absolutely sure on that, but maybe help family with a mortgage? Sure, why not?

As time goes on the percentage of bitcoin up for sale at any given point is more and more other people, and NOT the miners.  Eg if 99% of coins up for sale are by people who didn't mine those coins, those people aren't going to care what the cost to miners are - they are going to sell when they decide to, at the price they decide to, not based on the current price of equipment and electricity of miners.  If that price others are willing to sell for goes lower than the cost to produce, then miners drop out of the network and the difficulty goes down. Eg - difficulty follows price, price does not follow difficulty.

Eventually - I sold.  I gave in, and I sold.  The slow drip drip drip had finally gotten to me.  It just seemed like bad news after bad news, with nothing good on the horizon to make it go back up.

When Tether dropped to .98 cents a dollar the other day it was bought up to bring it back up to $1 (it actually overshot and went up to $1.04).  Circulating supply dropped 200 million, then circulating supply went back up to bring it back down to $1 (still 50 million lower than before any of that happened)
You're Tether.  If it's a scam - you've sold off billions without the dollars to back it up.  The government's breathing down your neck.  Are you really going to give up 200 million in profits to reduce the supply of something that you know has no value (which is the case if it's a scam)?  The only logical reason to spend millions is if you actually know you're legitimate, that you have them backed, and that you are getting something back that is backed by $1, for only 98 cents per (in which case spending 200 million just made you 4 million).

At least according to the article their last bull prediction was that we'd hit over 2k in 2017.  (It was met with much 'HAHA, yeah right, desperate much, of course they say that - they probably have some' at the time since it was before the run of 2017 started).

Usually it's just a down payment - then they send you a bill for the rest later.  It's better than it used to be though - back before Obamacare I had a plan that I didn't find out until I needed it, but they redefined 'maximum out of pocket' in the glossary section to mean 'maximum out of pocket, not including an additional $350  deductible per use'.  That's right - the plan I thought had a $2,500 deductible, 20% copay, $4,500 max out of pocket still had me paying out everytime even after I'd spend $7k in one year.  NOW - that kind of shenanigans aren't allowed at least.

Isn't this the exact reason things like [Purse.IO]( exist?  People willing to pay a little more than the going rate because they're in an area where it's harder to find an exchange, but Amazon is everywhere.

This exact guy has been saying things about Bitcoin for a long time now, long before the Democrats got the house.  At first this exact guy said Bitcoin was 'a crock', then he made fun of anybody who would use them as somebody 'sitting around their house in PJ's all day', now suddenly Bitcoin has the power to completely take away government control (according to him) and it needs to be 'nipped in the bud'.  He has even called on banning crypto before now, he said it last year too (July 18th, 2018).
If Democrats got on board with banning crypto, it would be in conjunction with Republicans, and it would be the moderates doing it. The ones that get huge contributions from the financial industry (one of Brad Sherman's top donors was a credit card processor).  The financial industry donated $339.2 million to the Republican party in 2016, and $289.6 million to the Democratic party in 2016.  In 2012 they donated $178 million to the Democrats, and $371 million to the Republicans. (2014 and 2018 midterms were also higher amounts going to Republicans).  Money talks in politics, so you can bet there's a lot more Brad Sherman's on the Republican side right now, people who got financial industry money to get to the office they are in right now.  On the Democrat's side the biggest financial industry receiver is Beto O'Rourke, with over $4 million in donations in 2018.  On the Republican side it's Martha McSally at $2.6 million in 2018 (Ted Cruz right behind her at $2.4 million).  Here's Brad Sherman (Allied Wallet is the credit card processor):  [ .  
O'Rourke for 2020 might be pretty bad for bitcoin, but let's be honest - Trump is going to rubberstamp any bill McConnell tells him to unless Fox News tells him his base won't like it, so it isn't like Trump winning would make things safer for cryptoholders.   Now, somebody like say Bernie Sanders - well, for the 2016 cycle - finance didn't even make it into his top 20 donors (the finance industry really didn't want him to win).

Intentionally not paying debt that has come due when you have the ability to just print the money and make it up out of thin air would be incredibly idiotic.......although I'm not going to say it could 'never happen'.
