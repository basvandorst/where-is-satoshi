Too bad there is currently a trade off between one thing and the other. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 19:30:54
Great, so they can use something else and leave the chain for those needing it most. Win win.

Yeah, but he's so handsome.

BTC is what the economic majority says is BTC. What Trezor, Bitstamp, Bitfinex etc say actually has a lot to do with it. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:31:20
Even if they are kind enough not to attack the network in this instance, this situation must be corrected longer term.
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:21:35
Probably we need a divide with these people at this point.

Are you serious? I hope you are not just making this up.

Do you know what Churchill famously said to Chamberlain?  :-)
@_date: 2015-11-13 11:41:41
I don't see why do you assume he doesn't understand.
Decentralisation may not be very well defined or measured but it remains a crucial element in this system. This is an important challenge and also a weakness that I think is being attacked.
@_date: 2015-11-07 13:16:19
I'm against the seemingly dishonest spamming and aggressive attacks on this community moderation, but I don't think a total ban of other competing forums is a good idea.

I'm on it. Downloading since Saturday, I still haven't managed to sync.
@_date: 2015-11-07 12:40:30
I think it's reasonable to ask the mods to at least try to enforce whatever rules they set.
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:05:37
I agree. I'm relatively new and I understood the underhanded tactics of the anti-decentralization proponents thanks to the moderation.
I thank them for their hard work because the people who want Bitcoin as a mere payment system that can be policed, they are relentless and they keep pushing their social engineering attacks onto the community.
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:55:33
Because I don't really care about reddit? You'll find that most people my age don't. 
I'll look it up when I have some free time since you genuinely seem not to know.

Whoa. The sheer lack of ethics and a moral compass of some people around here takes me aback.
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:45:50
Sounds good but not very immediate.
@_date: 2015-11-13 15:12:31
There's value in the long tail. There sometimes is a divide between popularity, quality and availability. This can work in niches.
@_date: 2015-11-06 22:47:00
Uhm. You do notice that this would lower the current cap? I feel it would be really controversial.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:32:58
Bitcoin has obviously evolved in several respects and now we understand the limitations better.
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:19:36
They did, and most of all Gavin who has said so many many times and leaving no doubts about it. Not that they don't need to, that they wouldn't and shouldn't in his vision.
This is one reference but there are many more and in video he's usually clearer (can't do that at work).
I have a lot of stuff to do so I may not connect for a while to check for any replies.

Personally, it makes me believe the node incentives problem is more urgent than increasing block size, but I don't think it has any immediate solutions. So, hard call.
@_date: 2015-11-11 16:07:27
I didn't say they're not, I said cash is used for these things because regulation is largely ineffective for any determined individual.
And this is a good thing, when wrong regulations don't work.
Sorry mate, we don't agree. I'm completely against the concept that I need permission to communicate or engage in economic transactions. Neither explicitly nor implicitly.
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:48:51
I honestly don't understand how is it a smear when both Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn openly advocate for nodes all moving to datacenters and discourage - particularly Gavin Andresen - that home users run nodes at all.
If you're a veteran here I'm sure you know this, right? So how is this a smear?
@_date: 2015-11-29 02:40:25
I have only done that for demonstration purposes. It really doesn't make much sense to use Bitcoin like that. You are present and not very anonymous, cash works fine without any fees and any reasonable Bitcoin fees would make such a low transaction rather pointless. On some other network using Bitcoin as a peg of value I guess it makes more sense, but really not as direct transactions. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 02:17:11
Or alternatively, miners motivated towards ulterior motives like censorship of transactions, data mining, anti-privacy agendas, etc. 
The monetary incentive is clear and strong, stopping other agendas. Altruism is fine but unlikely to resist these attacks as strongly as a functioning economy. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:47:31
What is the justification for the cap? What do you think it achieves? Surely a cap set so it won't be reached or else it's crippling, doesn't make sense.
I'm looking for opinions on this bit since it's almost all the code of 101 to set and coordinate this cap.
@_date: 2015-11-18 00:50:23
But does it overheat itself?
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:21:16
What solution do you like best?
@_date: 2015-11-16 10:30:47
They really need to calm down with their sensational headlines.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:50:39
Huge?? I seldom post.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:48:20
In fact they are, this is not even a conjecture. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:34:26
It's perfectly fine that cheaper fee transactions take longer to confirm in the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:06:48
I appreciate that the mods here work hard and are principled. This speaks volumes to me.
You on the other hand got aggressive immediately. Also how isn't it a problem for a decentralized system if nodes are burdened heavily without any direct compensation? Running nodes could end up making sense only for actors who want to control transactions for ulterior motives.
@_date: 2015-11-06 20:53:21
Ok, so what about no cap and if we miss then softfork down? Looks simpler, better by the same measure, and it considers the same scenarios.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:33:17
Are you ok?
@_date: 2015-11-21 10:55:39
Of course not, because there isn't such a thing as a Bitcoin computer.
@_date: 2015-11-13 15:34:42
I'm using Bittorrent since early days, this is nothing they'd know better. It's a separate community with a critical mass of people, not 2 sides. It can work without necessarily being popular.

Won't older nodes accept NOP2 just fine but execute a different result?
@_date: 2015-11-06 20:45:30
I honestly don't understand how is it a goal that a projection is optimistic. What you want a projection to be is accurate, or at least sufficiently correct, or at least moderately achievable... Otherwise why any limits at all? Infinite capacity is even more optimistic, surely?
Can you elaborate on this? I want to understand the logic behind this point of view.
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:18:07
Ok that makes sense.
What I don't see there is any merits whatsoever to having a cap. If you think the cap has absolutely no point and introduces problems then no cap makes a lot more sense and is much simpler than all that dynamic moving of the cap for decades.
I think the cap needs a justification to keep, and be set to achieve its justification. However I haven't seen in the messages written by people advocating 101 a single recognition or merit of having a cap at all. All I read is that caps are crippling.
I'm going through the BIPs related to scalability right now, trying to understand the support for 100 and 101 in reddit.
Thanks for taking the time to compile these points.
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:34:20
Do you honestly ignore this?
Ask Gavin.
I really don't have that much time to spend in reddit.
@_date: 2015-11-06 23:36:28
That would depend on what does the cap supposedly accomplish.
If what we want is spam protection then something like x3 would do but retargeting much more often than 1000 blocks. Maybe moving average of 500 blocks retargeting every 25 blocks or something like that. Otherwise this panicky community will panic when there is a genuine peak of demand and blocks take a whole week to adjust.
However that rules out the fee market induced by cap school of thought. 
So first we need to agree to what's the point of the cap if it has any.
All these numbers are debatable of course, as are the premises. The point is that we need to agree somehow to what do we want to achieve and what is the point of every parameter as well as their interactions. In my short experience participating in the community I don't see this happening at all. I see angry repeating of set beliefs by each part of every argument.
@_date: 2015-11-11 16:40:04
It's either that or prison-like safety.
The same would happen with cash and I don't want cash gone for walled garden safety.
This is why everybody should be extremely careful and anonymous on the net. It needs to be dangerous to some degree to be free.
@_date: 2015-11-07 12:55:32
There needs to be some sort of discussion regarding what parameters are actually meant to achieve before deciding how to set them.
@_date: 2015-11-07 12:52:08
Some altcoins have also been temporarily compatible with a coin and copied its balances. At least Feathercoin for sure.
@_date: 2015-11-06 06:57:51
Ignore Gavin's position on nodes belonging in datacenters. When I have more free time I will look it up but honestly this is something I'd expect every veteran to know. He's been rather vocal about it, and meaning home users *should not be nodes*, rather than *should not be required to be nodes* which is something nobody would have a problem with.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:20:04
I'm actually new yes, and I just finished the Princeton coursera Bitcoin course. I was introduced to Bitcoin as a technology early this year.
Generally speaking, reddit doesn't offer much to me or my demographic which is why I didn't bother creating an account earlier. I'm married and in my 40s and this site seems for 14 year old hormonal boys.

Maybe we can make this big among casual gamers.

I don't think Bitcoin can protect ordinary people in their daily lives if the government suddenly does something like this. People are unlikely to all go clandestine overnight. 
It would be a tiny minority of people even trying to resist this sort of government overreach. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 03:02:41
Is there a real risk of this change being refused by miners?
@_date: 2015-10-21 17:22:11
Seems they are lenient sometimes.

This isn't Bitcoin. This is just a subreddit.

This is not strictly Bitcoin, but Bitcoin users should be especially careful with leaking data for obvious reasons.

'You were given the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, and you will have war.'  to Neville Chamberlain from Winston S. Churchill, about British involvement to stop Nazi Germany.
The context was trying excessive appeasement rather than standing your ground against hostiles.
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:39:02
Many things in the whitepaper are completely obsolete. For instance nodes, users and miners and the same thing in the whitepaper, and then in the appendix it's light wallet users versus node-miners (still the same thing there). Pooled mining for instance wasn't considered.
People need to stop referring to it as some sort of Gospel because the exact wording of it is off and obsolete already in several points. You may respect the vision and intent of Satoshi and I do myself, but the technology has advanced and active devs today know better than Satoshi did before anything remotely similar to Bitcoin ever existed.
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:30:28
Is 101 your preferred proposal?
@_date: 2015-10-18 19:25:46
Ok, but any reason you don't allow that?
@_date: 2015-10-23 18:43:07
I don't follow this community much, but this seems like progress yet some people receive it with negativity. Why?
@_date: 2015-11-07 12:53:11
People escalate when rules are not enforced.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:13:22
At that time I believe miners and nodes were the same thing. GA and MH say this now and I disagree with that vision. Respectfully if you will, but I don't agree.
@_date: 2015-11-02 02:12:54
Why is this so strongly downvoted?
Surely it's better to discuss these things?
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:35:14
I don't think there's much disagreement to that. The differences seem to be in approach and perceived urgency. Visions vary a lot and sometimes in very incompatible ways, and since governance and development are so linked together this can be pushed until massive rifts appear.
@_date: 2015-11-28 20:55:31
Development is picking up pace. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:48:37

Absolutely, nobody blames on cash that it finances ISIS, political corruption, pedophile rings, etc. The idea of global internet cash is very, very politically radical and whoever denies this is suspect of wanting to deactivate Bitcoin into some sort of distributed database for the banking industry.
@_date: 2015-11-07 13:06:09
If there is that need, then the logical thing would be to study it and set the cap accordingly. This is related to my original post, we cannot set it because it's optimistic, right? The projection would have to respond to a need above responding to a wish.
In the text of 101 I don't see any reasoning for this justification and I also don't see it elaborated elsewhere. The curve seems to follow a goal arbitrarily set.
I know this doesn't have much visibility but I'd like to see more on this particular subject.
@_date: 2015-10-18 11:57:13
But I like euphoria. Also... $270.
@_date: 2015-11-08 21:46:11
Yes, and this combination for me it's the most important thing. Mainly because it's the whole point, Bitcoin cannot compete with centralised systems in throughput or in efficient use of resources, generally speaking.
An alternative Open Source payment channel is probably an interesting effort for micropayments. But this, although ambitious, is simply much less ambitious than a truly free netwide currency and it would be regulated shortly.
I can see why their proponents want to fork, because both visions are highly incompatible.

Don't BIP101 blocks have version&gt;3?
I guess these blocks will be orphaned if they contain transactions with CLTV and they are not correct. Is this plausible in the short term?
