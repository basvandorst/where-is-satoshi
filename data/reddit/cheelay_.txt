Does Gemini have segwit support?

I thought it was noteworthy because it's quite easy for Bitcoin to swing 7% or 8% in a day or so, which now means it could be swinging through $1000 changes all the time. In fact, that's exactly what happened today, when it went from $13,000 to $14,000 in about 4 hours.

Bitcoin takes the day off only on Christmas and Veterans' Day.

I think it's the 10k Euro wall. It's taking a while to punch through.

Everything about Bitcoin has a bit of terror built-in.

I saw it. That wall caved in and gdax exploded.

Not a bad article. Explained at a basic level with good examples.

I think this post has already been priced in.

I'm not sure if you are asking for more explanation or not. Just in case: 
For Bitcoin to go from $1000 to $2000, the price had to increase 100%. From $2000 to $3000, the price had to increase 50%. Each successive $1000 gain comes at a smaller and smaller percentage price increase. To go from $14k to $15k, the price would have to increase only 7.1%
You can find the % change needed for any $1000 price jump by dividing $1000 by the initial price ($1000/$14000 in the example above).

Don't wait for it. Go buy your own dip and celebrate 12k with some nachos!

That seems to be why futures markets have a "spot price," which is an agreed upon metric.

There's nothing wrong with enjoying some profits, at some point. I would be pretty happy to pay off my mortgage and still have some coins left over.

The charts are not flawed, they're just not showing you what you want to see. They are useful in other contexts.

You suggest losing your wife and your mind for Bitcoin? Doesn't seem like great advice.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:48:39
My sense is that the futures markets will magnify current trends. And Bitcoin has been trending upwards (almost) forever.

Thanks for the link. Hodling caught on quick!

Clearly Bitcoin needs to find it's other red shoe first.

Fascinating chart. If you look at the sort option "Comparison" and choose Compare Currencies, you will see what the difference is between 2016 and 2017 (notice, the big dropoff was at the start of 2017 not 2018). One word, "China."
I'm finding it hard to believe the dates on the chart are accurate. It seems like the dropoff should not have started in January 2017. But it's hard to know for sure.
If you sort by individual exchange, you will see that Coinbase (for example) has not had a significant volume dropoff like your original graphic implied.
