The difference is stocks are part ownership in a company, and that company will recover and continue generating revenue. its not in a digital beanie baby.
Stocks have always been long term assets, when you put money into them there are times where you can't access it because the market is down. 
This is why smart investors diversify into defensive assets as well as growth assets depending on how conservative they are. These defensive assets are the ones you rely on when you can't rely on your growth assets.
Not to mention the fact that even in a bear market stocks will continue to pay dividends

using a credit card to gamble on a bubble early enough doesn't make it a good financial decision lol

Past performance is no indication of future returns. Just because Bitcoin survived crashes in the past does not mean it will survive this one.

to a financially sound individual, credit cards are useful for the points (freebies) and.. thats about it really.
or perhaps in a crisis of liquidity where you need a line of credit to tide you over in some situation while you can convert some capital back to cash (which immediately pays off the card) 
but a lot of people have fallen deep into a trap with credit cards and are just getting ruined by them by living beyond their means

sure, but A) good research and B) diversification protects you from stocks that are overvalued or will go bust.
not to mention having solid stop losses. 
Dividends are also optional for a company this is true, but many people (especially in older age) value dividend stocks. So it doesn't matter if a big tech company doesn't pay dividends if you specifically are buying a dividend stock... (good example, Commonwealth Bank in Australia)
you sound like you have very little to no experience dealing with finance, but you are on r/bitcoin so what did i expect

Banks are not as evil as you'd think... making terrible financial decisions like investing in crypto with a credit card is how you end up bankrupt. The bank is doing you a favour

Is it much of a battle if bitcoin already loses by feb 2018?
