Yes, you can load bitcoin core and then extract the private keys from that wallet.  You can then load up electrum and sweep those keys to get an up to date balance.  If you only want to see the balance though, just load it up with bitcoin core on a secure operating system to read the addresses.  You can then use blockchain website or others to read the balance there.  If you want to spend those coins then you would need to fully load / sync on bitcoin core or import your keys into electrum.  Have fun!

You would have to check all of those individually and add them up manually.  If you still have the original block chain along with your wallet.dat then you may be fine to just load up a recent version and it will report the contents of your wallet up to that point.  It really doesn't take long to download the data and check.  I think your best bet is just to load your wallet.dat into electrum using this:  but yeah, still manual work required...  I have the blockchain loaded on my system, what you could do is encrypt your wallet and then DM me and I could check it for you, but you need to use a newer bitcoin core client in order to encrypt it and basically at that point, why not just load up the full blockchain and check for yourself?

I sold off my BTC as well and paid off our house.  If I had friends who were upset that I didn't spread the wealth I would no longer call them a friend.  Toxic people are not worth your time and if that is how they act when this happens to you, how would they act under other circumstances?  Luckily for me all of my family and friends are super happy for us and that is what your friends should be towards you.  I'd say to dump them...

If he mined solo he would have never gotten it because the first transaction from coinbase goes to pool address.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:55:39
I should add, please post and let us know how much you found, some people end up finding much more than they ever thought they had...
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:34:18
For him to mine solo the transaction from the coinbase must go to one of his wallets, not to the pool's wallet.  Because it goes to the pool's wallet he would have never found it in the first place as others have mentioned because the hashes would have been completely different.

The first transaction from coinbase goes to pool's address.  This system was designed to prevent stuff like this.

I've held them for more than one year so 15% capital gains on the first ~$418k of income and 20% on gains after that.  I'll only have the 15% to worry about, luckily...  You should pay your taxes or spend years thinking about how you should have.

'bucks' is not more logical but it, too, is already a word that means something else
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:47:52
Yes, exactly.  We are following the Dave Ramsey Baby Steps plan and we are now on the very last step which is: Build Wealth and Give Generously.  Giving is so vitally important to any financial plan.  Ask any wealthy people what is the most fun they have ever done with money and the answer is generally: giving.  Thanks!

Yep, I have to say that I put the request in in the morning (06:00 EST) and they fulfill it by close of business (18:00 EST).

Those who have been around long enough already know what happened only a month ago and what was happening again now.  Had I only had deposits ready for it, anyhow, expect deposits to start coming in and people buying it back up, a great buying opportunity come and gone and my wife called it...  If it is lower tomorrow I'll really be shocked and it would be worth buying back in, but it may be over...  No one truly knows...

Buy another harddrive, install linux on it, run bitcoin core or lightweight wallet like electrum and then encrypt your wallet and use zip or 7zip to add a password and then email it to yourself or store it in some cloud service.  The only way to hold BTC long term is to use "cold storage".  Running linux prevents windows malware from stealing your wallet.  I hope that helps you...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:31:41
Yes, that is why I got into it in the first place and yes, you are so right.  Now I only rely on the banks for some money transfers, hopefully we can change that side as well and be done with these octopuses (search for Bank Octopus):

I still have both but now debt-free and I agree on Kiyosaki.  He has some gems of information but you are always responsible for the decisions you make.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:44:32
lol, yes, I know.  Dave has served us well and I was so early into bitcoin and mining them that my tiny gamble paid off, in hind sight, wow...  Yeah, let's not go there, I've done well enough...
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:46:47
Awesome!  Which exchange did you use and how was your experience?  Now time to build wealth and give!
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:45:56
nope just shy of $11k, which is just enough to pay off the mortgage, pay the capital gains taxes and only spend a small amount of my bitcoins.  So I still have more than enough left.  If Mt. Gox and Butterfly Labs had not taken most of them I would be doing much better, but oh well, what can we do?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:47:56
My wife and I are watching the prices while shopping, it is quite entertaining to watch.  A friend of ours just bought in a couple of days ago, but I made sure it was small enough and wouldn't really affect their lives if they lost it.  They now want to buy more, I don't blame them.  Even my wife was thinking of buying some when it hits $13k, but that just came and went within minutes.  Oh well, probably time to call it a night and see what happened in the morning, good night y'all!
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:50:36
Best to call it what it really is: 0.0005 BTC is really 50,000 satoshis
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:14
I bought a 50 GH/s one from them and was stupid to spend 65 BTC for it when BTC was $10.  Should have just paid cash out of pocket...  It is sitting in my garage as well, anyone want a $1 million bitcoin miner?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:38:56
Yep, whereas Dave Ramsey serves others and not himself and gets rewarded nicely for it.

I once heard Robert Kiyosaki say that professional gamblers live by one rule: "Don't count it as your money while it is still in the game."  I, too, sold enough bitcoin to pay off my mortgage.  I had a certain price point that both my wife and I agreed upon and once it hit that point we sold that many bitcoins to pay off the house.  We both agreed on the strategy and while it has gone higher, I have no regrets.  Our money is now ours as it is no longer in the game.  Enjoy your house!
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:52:12
Nice, frankly speaking I don't mind paying taxes on the gain.  I'm happy they are only 15% and not 50% or something else crazy high.  It would be nice if they were lower but I don't mind it.
