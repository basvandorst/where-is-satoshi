I'm with you on the can't wait for the lightning network. I bailed. Dumped 90% of my coins. Last 10% is saved for lightning network testing purposes. Once it's stable, I'll put more of my weight back on btc.

Why didn't op have control over their btc during the bch fork? Exchanges are convenient, but they control your funds.

I put 25% of each paycheck into crypto. It starts to accumulate after a while.
I usually keep enough usd to pay bills, and food. I'm set for the next 2 months. I can sit on my crypto without a job if I want until it bounces back. But yeah I only have $3.xx in my bank.

It's why I wish I had something to buy more of it with. Bank account is empty. Everything is in BTC right now. Luckily I pay my bills a few months in advance. I can wait for it to bounce back.

Screw that. If they wanna fork the bitcoin network, they can like anyone else. I'll dump their coin as soon as possible.

"Maybe thats not written down in your schoolbook of economics, but in your genes."
I'd love to see the evidence of that claim. I can't seem to get any of my neighbors to give me some of their time or money to work on my house or landscape. Don't they know that it increases everyone's property value if only they just did or paid their fair share. Our HOA/community would be so much nicer.

Yeah I got into bitcoin to keep people with those same types of ideas from stealing about 35% of my wealth and calling it taxes for wealth redistribution.
I guarantee if that idea ever happened, bitcoin would start to crash like the legacy system is now.
