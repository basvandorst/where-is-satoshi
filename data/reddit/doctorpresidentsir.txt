not to hijack your thread but wow man your story is so much like mine... I've never saved money before in my life... finding a comfortable niche in life and just spending every excess dollar... I saw an oportunity to make money on bitcoin (don't judge me guys, 90% of the recent investors are just like me) and I found a new passion for saving money. its an obsession now and I sometimes allocate more of my monthly budget into BTC than I can afford and I have to scrimp extra hard but who cares. I BELIEVE; and if I lose everything I'll still be exactly where I was before I started but with much more valuable experience.

my boss stopped doubting the rise of bitcoin and just expresses amazement when I update him on the price.
he had a group of rich "insiders" (he thinks rich people are insiders) who said that bitcoin was going to crash around 8k and he strongly advised me to sell; this was tempting at the time because it had risen from 5-8 with no dip when previously there was a dip every 1k.
 so glad I didn't sell and now my boss doesn't doubt bitcoin anymore. he laments that he doesn't have a single dime to spare for any BTC... I have been telling him to invest since 4400

I know man; I've had iron hands since buying at 4400ATH before the dip to 3k, and even I am tempted to dump right now. 
It's the uncertainty.... will the price crash right before fork and then settle out as the whales get back in before the b2x to still get their airdrops? or will it continue its meteoric rise straight up to the fork and then God knows what will happen after that?

When it comes to Roger Ver, we are not dealing with a rational person (some might go as far to question his sanity); we are talking about someone here who wants to start his own COUNTRY for crying out loud; you need a lot more than his purported 400k bitcoin to run/start a country. He needs control over a monetary system to bring in countless billions per year (ASICboost anyone?).
Imagine being Roger Ver; lets assume he still controls 400k BTC; if he could dump that incrementally for bCash and amass say... quadruple that amount in bTrash, on top of ASICboost and what ever other shady things he can imagine, he would easily be the richest person in the world BY FAR, even richer than Satoshi Nakamoto, if he managed to successfully take-over the bitcoin ecosystem, and the coin came anywhere close to 100k let alone a MILLION. 
Roger Ver's attack on bitcoin is very cunning, because he isn't risking anything, you see? 
If his attack is successful, his chain wins and he becomes unimaginably wealthy, the kind of wealth you would need to start your own country. If he fails, well then he is still only fabulously wealthy. 
He may be altruistic in his goal of establishing his own kingdom; but the methods he is employing to achieve them is extremely selfish and lowdown; people aren't just "investing only money they are willing to lose"; people are seeing something in bitcoin that they believe in and are literally throwing down everything they own to "make it". 
If Roger Ver is successful in his attack, countless people will lose everything; and a lot of people who didn't even invest everything will lose everything because one day, bitcoin will become everything.
