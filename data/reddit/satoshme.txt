And depending on where u are from dont forget about the extra headaches for the normies come tax season! Computing cost basis for everyday items is a nightmare. People want things that make life easier, not more difficult.

every crypto to crypto trade, crypto to fiat transaction and every purchase made with crypto needs to be reported. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 20:30:13
how do you know the merchant you bought groceries from isnt gonna report profits for their business?
And if they do, and you dont...then what?

The US needs to drastically change the way crypto is taxed for every grandma and joe schmoe in society to implement it on a daily basis, like fiat. Being required to check every purchase made in bitcoin, everyday, over the course of a year and figure out cost basis on every one of those transactions is a major hurdle.

I understand that and IMO its a major hurdle for mass adoption if u have to be pseudo tech savvy for daily purchases and its tax implications.

does this work for state, government, higher ed...etc jobs?

Are you in the US? I know freelancers in the US have to pay a ton in taxes, up to 35-40% if they get a 1099-misc.
What kind of freelance work?

Thanks. Dont want to use a VPN. 100x liquidation I am aware of that risk. lol. Looking for 2-5x or so.

Did they help out employees who had no idea what they were doing but wanted to get their feet wet in the crypto space? Or were you expected to have your own wallet, prvt keys, understand how it works...etc?
I believe getting paid in bitcoin from a business or company will help mainstream adoption....beyond mining or simply buying it. But fear in what you said about when the market drops, you cant pay your mortgage, is true.  Will bitcoin ever stabilize? There will always be whales....buying and selling, followed by fomo, year in year out.

Whatever you do, dont give the answer away. Give the community at least a week or more. I wont even get time to really take a look at it until the upcoming work week. :-)
And thanks!

What about alts when bitcoin is $1m? If bitcoin is a stable currency at that point, will alts (with a much less mcap) still be a good investment until they reach their $1m bitcoin equivalent? Or will bitcoin render most alts useless at that point?
@_date: 2018-08-23 21:56:36
lol....im good with 2-5x

When Bitcoin hits $1 million will people still buy? At that point the price would have to climb to $2m just for someones $20 dollar investment to double to $40. 
Assuming we hit $1m Bitcoin in 2023, thats 15 yrs from genesis to $1m. So will it take an additional 15 years to go from $1m to $2m? 
...And have to wait 15 yrs for that $
20 dollar investment to become $40?

Is there an official "For Sale for Bitcoin" sub?
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:57:48
Curious, on average how much does 1 slice of pizza cost when paying with BTC after network fees have been added?
@_date: 2019-01-04 03:40:48
Does anyone have an updated source of current, non blockchain related, jobs or companies that offer the option to pay their employees in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-04 05:36:15
Thanks. Yeah, thats mostly programming via remotely or freelance stuff. Im thinking more of an actual 9-5, benefits and salary sorta thing...in a non tech work place. 
Curious to know what industries in various areas offer this.
