97% of altcoins are merely fraudulent dilution of the market cap and development/ marketing talent opportunity for Bitcoin, Ethereum, BCH, Litecoin, IOTA, ZEC, XMR, XLM, XRP,  ADA, and maybe another dozen or two projects   
we need 50-100 crypto projects not 5,000 - 10,000

bitcoin isnt made for building on.   have you ever seen the block sized
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:07:57
because its built to scale ahead of demand,  while also providing  Ethereum size data capabilities.   
its like the polar opposite of self imposed small block BTC   (which offloads network trust to third parties like lightning)
@_date: 2019-07-09 17:13:04
its SO large that we can LITERALLY fit 12 smartphone pictures in a  SINGLE BLOCK!

its a class conscious weapon against the working class and poor  (i'm talking about fiat currencies,  which are perpetually inflated).    Bitcoin presents an opportunity for the labor and poverty classes to earn value  (by labor)  and then store it is small units of an asset that cannot be inflated by the nation.
Think of it in another way like a small unit of real estate.   With actual real estate,  the costs of entry to ownership are too high for the labor and poverty class to acquire in it   (rather the ruling class of capitalists buy it all up and then conduct rent seeking exploitation).
With bitcoin,  laborers and poor can save small crumbs - which over time retain value against their locally used fiat currencies.   When cash on hand is needed,  simply convert back into the local fiat and spend it.   (the bitcoins will tend to gain in value against the inflating fiat - which benefits the labor class).
The current fiat currency model is invented and deployed by the rent seeking capitalists because it allows them to pressure the laborer into spending their earnings paycheck-to-paycheck in rents and other commodities (which the capitalist also profits by the sales of).
Its a self serving system that helps them, at our expense.   Bitcoin is changing the balance of power

now that the global bubble burst,  you probably are crazy.   
the days when you were crazy and right was 2013-2016   
now that the global mania bubble happened,  youre probably just crazy to think  $4,000 bitcoin is any smarter than $1300 oz gold,  or $175 facebook
@_date: 2019-04-15 18:19:34
not really disagreeing with any of that fundamentally,  i'm also a bitcoiner.   but let me throw some caution.   youre using only 10 data points to try and create conclusions from the yearly lows  (thats nothing but high risk pseudo science).  
other point is to the original,   this is about human psychology/  social media/  retail thinking  
bitcoin as a burst bubble - might never reachieve its old highs let alone new ones.   When we talk about "adoption"  this is still a farce.   Lets take another recent bubble for example,   fidget spinners --  Real World Use Case?   yes.  provide happiness and calm  
Adoption?  yes,  they were picked up everywhere literally  
Diversity?  yes,  thousands of pop up companies,  youtube channels,  brands,  extras, etc  
and then the psychology of the collapse.   the makers of the bubble are now rich,  and the rest of us are left with some gimmick toys in the junk drawer  
Don't let your thinking get ahead of reality.  Bias is a killer

i do agree here to some basic extent,   but i also disagree.   there are a multitude of material commodities that have unequivocal value.   1.  plots of land/ formidable homes/ real estate in a general sense that has consensus verified private ownership 2.  functional relevant machinery  3. foods/ animals/ etc that are in a productive phase of their life  4. goods and services that are broadly utilized by western culture:  cars, computers, appliances, books, guns, you name it.  
So yes,  sure if you want the logical extreme argument...  yes  there is a point to be made that value is always a human conceived subject.   but to the flipside,   there is a massive gap between   "value"   as applies to shiny rocks/  objects of obsession,   vs   "value"  as applies to goods, assets, and services that have a nearly global consensus as meaningful and immediately deployable assets
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:48:55
which is to say that its only a figment of the imagination?   not an actual material commodity

effectively nobody got involved with Bitcoin/ crypto in the sense of quantitative retail and institutional capital,  until mid-late 2017 - the majority coming during the parabolic run from $5,000 to $20,000   (and of course remained handcuffed during the 1+ year depression that followed)
