That's absolutely amazing and I totally get you.
I had to see how my Grandfather slowly withered away with Dementia. It was scary and heartbreaking. He did very irrational stuff, like suddenly using Vodka as an aftershave or giving me weird guidance on how to get a job (I was still studying). 
So I propose

Can you see the famous Satoshi 1 Million Bitcoins anywhere?

First of all: Get a Nano Ledger. Seriously. 
Second: Enjoy something (A Tesla 3 seems like a good idea). 
Third: Pay off all big loans
Fourth: Forget about it or if you don't believe in Crypto, sell all and buy stocks.
EDIT: Also don't tell anyone. Help your closest friends/families if they have money-problem but don't tell them how much you have.

How dumb can you buy buying something after it increased by more than 400% in a month? Did you think it go up much higher? I knew that there would be a bubble and it wouldn't take long until it bursts. I didn't think it would be this soon but I was ready to buy bitcoins cheap (I will probably wait until they are at 30-60). 
If you need the money now, you are fucked. If you can wait a year, you should be fine. 
EDIT: I can't believe someone with no clue is playing with money he can't afford to lose. Sorry, but no nice words from me here.

Well, if i'm understanding this correctly, bitcoins are currently being generated but not destroyed, so bitcoins actually should lose on value but because everyone is buying them (as investment), they get more rare and so they always increase in value. The bubble could explode tomorrow or in two years, it depends when the big investors made enough money ("Yea, lets sell those 200 millions worth in bitcoins!" -&gt; tons of bitcoins on the market -&gt; they are not rare anymore -&gt; price drops)
Please correct me if im wrong.
