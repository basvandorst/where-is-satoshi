Are you using a chat program on their website?
If so, it is entirely possible that they saw your ip address was the same as the one your account was created from or the same one you always logged in from. 
I used to mod a small internet forum back in the day, and the admins and mods could see the ip address that each user account was created from. If you were using their chat service on their site, it isn't unreasonable to assume they matched the ip addresses. 
Not 100% authentication, but pretty damn good. The odds of somebody going to the same house/internet cafe/library/whatever that you registered your account from just to pretend to be you to turn off the account are pretty slim.
EDIT: Or were you logged in when you went to use the chat?

If my phone is lost or stolen, how would I press 7?

That's neat.….but how do I know the guy that built it isn't going to just steal my cash/bitcoins?

If I import my paper wallet to coin base, can I still sell my bitcoins at the current price?

I wonder if they saw that post on the front page yesterday?
It's nice to see they are taking our comments into consideration.
