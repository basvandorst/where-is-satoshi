There are currently two ways to do segwit.
1. Bech32 are native segwit addresses and saves the most amount of space.
2. P2SH-P2WPKH is a nested segwit address using P2SH. It uses a few more bytes, but enables better compatibility.
A native Bech32 segwit is better in that it saves more space by not requiring the additional scripting. However the majority of outdated/non-updated wallets will not allow you to send to a bech32 address for security as it doesn't appear to be a valid address.
P2SH-P2WPKH adds a few more bytes to the transaction, but allows full backwards compatibility with old wallets. 
While I'd imagine everyone will one day use Bech32 addresses due to it's benefits (smaller size, easier reading). Old wallets have compatibility issues with sending to bech32, where as P2SH works fine.
Note, there are no issues with sending *from* a bech32 address regardless of the output address format. The issue is only with old wallets thinking the address you entered is invalid.
I wouldn't recommend any mobile wallet other than samourai wallet. Although this is mostly personal preference.

Don't forget about Segwit, it increases the blocksize limit up to a max of 4MB. With 90-95% adoption of segwit, you can get 15-20 TPS. 
Still not an incredibly high TPS, but add in Schnorr signatures and MAST, then the TPS starts to climb higher.
All of which can be done without a hardfork, and keeping the 1MB base blocksize/complete backwards compatibility.
In other words, our current 1MB is being used inefficiently and we still have a long way to go before we need to raise the blocksize.

They chose to pass the fees onto their users because it's easier than upgrading their backend.
Keep in mind, fees are related to the size of a transaction in bytes, and not the value being transacted. IE the same fee would be applied whether sending $50 or $500,000.

Slight copy/paste of past replies on changing the pricing to millibitcoin or microbitcoin.
As long as individual users are given the choice to view or change to whatever unit they prefer we can keep Bitcoin as the default. We don't need to forcefully change the base Bitcoin unit on the network, sites, or wallets as Bitcoin already uses metric prefixes for easily identifiable amounts.
Bitcoin, decibitcoin, centibitcoin, millibitcoin, microbitcoin, satoshi.
I'm all for encouraging sites to enable additional units for personal preference. Forcing a default that isn't bitcoin is where I disagree.
If you like, you can also express bitcoin using the tonal system, in fact, any pre-existing number system works fine as long as it isn't forced or attempts to replace existing standards.
As for wanting to skip right to μBTC, It's is called microbitcoin. "Bit" is a terrible name for a unit. It causes far more confusion than understanding. While the existing metric prefix's are used and understood globally. It's much better to keep bit as an abbreviation for Bitcoin. This allows a three syllable, easy to say, and easy to recognize units by using prefix + bit. IE decibit, centibit, millibit, microbit.
Within context, the prefix becomes all you need to convey the amount. IE deci, centi, milli, micro which can then be shortened further by dropping the last syllable to dess, cent, mill, mike or mic. All of which naturally derives from the full name.
Here's how the metric prefix system works, and applies to Bitcoin.
Prefix | Symbol | 10^n | decimal| English Scale 
decibitcoin| d | 10^-1 | 0.1 | Tenth
centibitcoin | c | 10^-2 | 0.01 | Hundredth 
millibitcoin | m | 10^-3 | 0.001| Thousandth
microbitcoin | μ | 10^-6 | 0.000001| Millionth
satoshi | s | 10^-8 | 0.00000001| Hundred Millionth

Can't tell if trolling, or autocorrect... but will answer anyways.
Bitcoin is divided down to 8 decimal places giving 100 million sub-units per *coin*.
Intentional or not, this is just under the largest number of total units you can have without running into integer/floating point issues. 
100 million sub-units x 21 million coins is 2.1 quadrillion total units or 2^50.9 and just under the double precision floating point max of 2^53. Adding further decimal places could have resulted in errors, loss of accuracy and a much more difficult time coding and porting across many programing languages.
It is possible in the future to add more units, which will follow the metric SI prefix system (nano, pico, femto, atto) but would require careful workarounds for legacy programing languages and software.

Tether is another cryptocurrency supposedly tied to the USD that's being used in place of actual USD on some exchanges. This avoids the difficulty of getting banking partners for some exchanges while still being able to offer BTC/USD pairing.
The threat, is that tether may not be solvent or actually tied to the USD. Meaning every exchange using it as a dollar substitute, can't redeem actual USD if they had to.
Inflating the price would be potentially possible by tether insiders inflating the supply of tether without USD backing and using it to buy bitcoin and other coins. Essentially making exchanges using tether become fractional reserve by proxy.
There is a lot of fud, and uncertainty being spread about it. At this time, there isn't enough evidence one way or the other and unfortunately it's a wait and see situation. Keep in mind, it takes no effort to spread fud, but a lot of effort for the companies/people to combat it.

A hardfork is a protocol replacement, not a tool for temporary and singular changes.
For there to be support of a hardfork, it must include numerous upgrades that can only be done through a hardfork with the expectation that another hardfork may never again occur. There are also hardfork wishlists which must be considered when planning any such changes.

A transaction that is unconfirmed or *stuck* remains in your wallet but it's *hidden* until it is either confirmed or a set amount of time passes and the wallet makes those funds spendable again. As such, a dropped transaction doesn't get refunded, because it never left the wallet in the first place.

Fees are high due to inefficient use of the available block space. 
Fees are priced in BTC, using sat/byte not USD. The larger the transaction (in bytes) the higher the fee. 
This also means when the price of bitcoin rose 20x, fees rise at the same rate.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:54:15
Inefficient use of the available block space has resulted in higher fees. Additionally fees are based on transaction size (in bytes) using sat/byte. As the price of Bitcoin rose 20x, so did the fees using the same sat/byte cost basis.
As more companies and users put in the effort to more efficiently use the blockspace with segwit and batched transactions we will see lower fees.
New features such as the lightning network look to take a massive load off of the bitcoin network, and greatly reduce fees using second layer transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:04:05
Maybe ;) the time since you made your transaction and now has been pretty insane with price swings and large amounts of transactions with people willing to pay exceedingly higher fees for priority.

I too have been in bitcoin for several years. Watched it grow and have weighed all scaling options and debates on their own merits. After going through each, I've always come to the conclusion that they are laughable with numerous faults, issues, risk, and pose a detriment to the network. Bcash for example is a copy/paste altcoin which would collapse under it's own weight if it were to gain any traction or users. It *works* today because no one uses it.

bc1 is the new bech32 format that requires segwit. Common segwit addresses start with a 3 like multisig addresses.
A standard segwit (3) address is backwards and forwards compatible with all existing wallets.
bc1 (bech32) addresses are only partially supported across various wallets. Many wallets don't recognize it as a valid address and won't allow you to send to it. This will change as wallets get updated.
Transactions are *just* as fast as every other transaction. The difference is segwit can utilize additional blocksize allowing your fee to be much smaller.
As long as the input is segwit, it doesn't matter if you send to a segwit, or legacy address to see the benefits.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:49:22
Lol, btc is far from screwed. Segwit enables blocks larger than 1MB which most seem to want. If you want bigger blocks, use segwit, if you don't want bigger blocks don't use segwit.
The incentives are lining up nicely. Higher fees are causing outrage from users, forcing companies and service providers to respond by more efficiently using available blockspace. Things such as batch transactions and using segwit in their backend.

I can't really make any recommendations, it also depends on where you live/what's available in your region. Region specific exchanges are usually smaller, but it's easier and quicker to get money in and out of them.
The larger the exchange, the more volume and easier it is to get a fair market price. Due to their size, verification and support may take longer.
I'd suggest reading the terms and deposit/withdrawal fees of various exchange that are available to you and compare them.
An option I often see are people using multiple exchanges/brokers. A local exchange with possibly higher fees, but easier entry/exit to buy/deposit to a bank IE coinbase. Then a non-local but cheaper, high volume exchange to day trade.

RBF must be set before the transaction is made.
Were you using a segwit address, or legacy address? I don't think the chrome extension wallet for segwit currently has RBF option. The legacy wallet does, and it should be somewhere in the settings.
In all honesty, if it's not an urgent transaction, it might be easier to just wait for the transaction to either get confirmed, or drop from the network on its own.

With lightning, when you close a channel, I believe you choose where to send the funds with the fee being deducted from the total available to you.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:30:26
A transaction that is never confirmed doesn't really matter if it's from, and to yourself. The coins will remain in the original address if not confirmed.
If a transaction doesn't get a confirmation, it will default back to being spendable allowing you to try again after a while. Feel free to send with a low transaction fee, wait 2 weeks and if it hasn't confirmed try again. Just make sure you control the address your sending from.
If the wallet support it, enable RBF replace by fee. It will allow you to rebroadcast the transaction at a higher fee before it's dropped from the mempool.

Coinbase is a broker, not an exchange. That comes with high fees and a price premium.
To avoid a large amount of fees when buying/selling/trading sign up and get verified on an actual exchange. An exchange account can be thought of similarly to a secondary bank account. You will be given a deposit address to wire/transfer a lump sum of money into the account and use it to trade. The money stays in your exchange account until you choose to withdraw to your bank, or bitcoin address.
There will still be fees on an exchange, but will be less than a broker and get you the actual market spot price.

It was absolutely coinbase who *set* the fee at a price likely far higher than required. Coinbase did not pocket the fee, it goes to the miners which is what their support may have been alluding to. (Additionally their lack of segwit addresses makes their fees cost twice as much which they happily pass on to the customer)
Fees in bitcoin are determined by the amount of data required to permanently store your transaction in the blockchain. More inputs/outputs equal a larger transaction, and higher cost. The fees have nothing to do with the value being transacted. That same fee would have worked the same on a transaction worth $5, or $5,000,000.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:48:45

It would cost them to implement segwit across their servers/services. Altcoins are essentially copy/paste of existing code so take no effort to add them.

Samourai wallet is great, but it's still in early development with a lot of features missing/not final.
Coin control is pretty rough, and works almost opposite as expected. (you need to manually select what inputs NOT to spend)
For security/privacy, the change address automatically matches the output transaction type with no way to change it. This means, if you send to a legacy address, your change is sent to a legacy address.
Unable to pay-to-many, or add multiple outputs.
It's still a great wallet, and one of the best on mobile. But it's still far behind something like Armory on the desktop.

bc1 is a bech32 address. It's a new address format built on top of segwit. All bc1 address are segwit, but not all segwit addresses are bc1.
Segwit addresses are p2sh like multisig, and can start with a 3. Using segwit with a 3 is currently better for compatibility as not many wallets support bech32 and refuse to send. This will change as wallets update and people move to the new easier to read transaction format.

Lightning will be ready when it's ready. It's currently being tested on the testnet, grab some tBTC and try it. Nothing gets pushed/supported on the mainnet until it's been thoroughly tested. Technically, lightning is functional and nothing is stopping users from running it on the mainnet but they risk losing their funds due to undiscovered bugs and issues.
1MB (segwit already enables blocks up to a max of 4MB if fully adopted) stays for now because it requires a hardfork to change it.
A hardfork is a protocol replacement, not a tool for temporary and singular changes.
For there to be support of a hardfork, it must include numerous upgrades that can only be done through a hardfork with the expectation that another hardfork may never again occur. There are also hardfork wishlists which must be considered when planning any such changes.
Then of course, there is the required lead time and testing before activating on the mainnet. Time that could be better spent improving what we already have, and other features currently in the works such as schnorr signatures, and MAST.

Fees are based entirely on the amount of data required to create the transaction. It has nothing to do with the value that's being transacted.
The network is currently congested, but as more people switch to segwit, and the spam attacks slow, it should come down.

Unfortunately, those *certain* parties tend to be custodial services which pass the fees onto their users and doesn't cost them a thing. Upgrading to segwit is what would cost them in the short term. Hopefully long term, they will lose users, community goodwill, and become irrelevant.

Yes the funds will become spendable in greenbits again after a set amount of time if it doesn't get confirmed.
Even though your wallet shows 0 coins, it still has an unconfirmed/hidden balance. There's nothing special that happens when making a transaction. The funds are either in your wallet, or in the wallet you sent them to; There is nothing in between. 
The time between sending a transaction and seeing 0 balance and getting a confirmation they are hidden from the user/marked unconfirmed/unspendable.
I'm not too familiar with greenbits, but they do support replace by fee. Unfortunately I think it's disabled by default. It should be listed in the settings. If the transaction was created with replace by fee enabled, you should be able to increase the fee and re-broadcast it without any issues.
GreenBits/GreenAddress appear to use 2 of 2 multisig by default, where you control one key, and they control one key. 
While they will sign any transaction you request, it does mean you don't have full control over your funds. Importing and creating a double spend with a different wallet may not be possible.

You cannot cancel, or force a transaction to be dropped from the mempool.
If you sent the transaction with the RBF flag (replace by fee) it's possible to rebroadcast the transaction with a higher fee.
If not, you can try to double spend using the same inputs but with a higher fee. Many nodes will not accept or broadcast a non-RBF transaction.
There's also nothing to refund, the coins are still in your wallet, just marked as unspendable while there is an active transaction in the mempool. Some wallets allow the coins to be spent again sooner than others.

Mining is designed to be a near zero sum game. Equal cost put in, equal revenue out with a very slim profit margin. The majority of profits come from lower electric costs compared to others. This is partly why asicboost is an issue.
When mining is highly profitable it creates demand for additional miners to come online. This in turn increases the difficulty, reducing profits to back to previously slim margins to correlate with the price.
Mining could also be profitable due to an intentional or not, lack of mining hardware available or out of reach to the average consumer. Such as the creation behind closed door mining cartels.
Not sure how accurate, but a quick search

While I may not agree with this, especially using *UTXO* as a measurement to determine blocksize. I also think you mean mempool, as UTXO is the list of unspent transaction outputs, not existing unconfirmed transactions. 
Using unconfirmed transactions in mempool could easily be gamed. Each node has their own mempool, while many share the same transactions they are not identical and run with their own rules.
One thing you have right is that a hardfork needs to include multiple *fixes/upgrades*. Every hardfork proposal should come with the assumption that another hardfork may never occur. The biggest complaint I have with every existing hardfork proposal is that it does far too little to even be considered.

You should take the time to understand what segwit is, and how it works.
Segwit is opt-in and does not change how existing transactions work. To see its effect users must choose to use it. Having only just activated, there is little in terms of ease-of-use wallet support. Creating a segwit address currently requires terminal/command line as no wallet gui's have it available. Expect it to become easier to use in the coming days.

Fees are not relative to the amount of Bitcoin sent. IE that same $2.90 fee can be used to send $5, $50, $500, $5,000, $50,000, etc. The fee is for the *data* that gets permanently written and stored in the blockchain.
Various scaling solutions for micropayments or small value transactions are coming. Segwit which in addition to a blocksize increase acts as a stepping stone towards implementing these solutions. Segwit will be active on the network in about 5 days.

Slight copy/paste of past replies on changing the pricing to millibitcoin or microbitcoin.
As long as individual users are given the choice to view or change to whatever unit they prefer we can keep Bitcoin as the default. We don't need to forcefully change the base Bitcoin unit on the network, sites, or wallets as Bitcoin already uses metric prefixes for easily identifiable amounts.
Bitcoin, decibitcoin, centibitcoin, millibitcoin, microbitcoin, satoshi. I'm all for encouraging sites to enable additional units for personal preference. Forcing a default that isn't bitcoin is where I disagree. If you like, you can also express bitcoin using the tonal system, in fact, any pre-existing number system works fine as long as it isn't forced or attempts to replace existing standards.
As for those wanting to skip right to μBTC, It's is called microbitcoin. "Bit" is a terrible name for a unit. It causes far more confusion than understanding. While the existing metric prefix's are used and understood globally. It's much better to keep "bit" as an abbreviation for Bitcoin. This allows a three syllable, easy to say, and easy to recognize units by using prefix + bit. IE decibit, centibit, millibit, microbit. Within context, the prefix becomes all you need to convey the amount. IE deci, centi, milli, micro which can then be shortened further by dropping the last syllable to dess, cent, mill, mike or mic. All of which naturally derives from the full name.

There is a large couple hundred million dollar a year incentive to pump, prop up, and promote bcash as it gleefully welcomes the use of covert Asic-Boost.
I don't think he would attempt to dump more than necessary as it would be more valuable for him if everyone began using it so they could continue using Asic-Boost.
I'd wouldn't be surprised if they make an announcement stating they will no longer mine the original Bitcoin chain after Segwit is locked due to ideological reasons but in reality it's because of the loss of Asic-Boost.

This is not a comprehensive detailed guide. Instead, this is an overview of the steps you should be taking to get a general idea of what to do and how to securely create paper wallets.
1. Download bitaddress from github. 
2. Verify signature, and copy to a USB flash drive.
3. Download tails linux distro (it includes a copy of electrum if you wanted to make an HD wallet as well.) 
4. Verify tails, install/burn it to a USB flash drive, or to a DVD.
5. Disconnect your computer from the internet and power down.
6. Boot into your clean offline linux distro, insert the USB flash that contains bitaddress source. Verify it again.
7. Run bitaddress.org.html and select paper wallets. I suggest hiding the art, as you can fit more addresses per page and use less ink/toner.
8. **Use BIP38 to encrypt your wallets**. This will act as a final barrier of protection should anyone find, or steal your physical paper wallets.
9. Print your wallets using a non-wifi enabled *dumb/old* printer (you don't want a printer that is connected to the internet, or stores a history of recent prints.) Make two or more copies to store in separate locations, a bank safety deposit box is a good idea.
Another thing to keep in mind with your printer is ink vs toner. Ink will run if it gets wet or damp, toner wont.

I'll need a source on that. I've never seen a toner print get ruined, or damaged due to heat. I've burned multiple prints when they're no longer needed/compromised. None of them have show signs of damage outside of the whole burning process. Depending how they burn the ashes can remain fully readable until broken apart.
Unless you're thinking of heat transfer paper that's used for receipts? 
Also it's why you need multiple backups in multiple locations just in case something happens.
For archival purposes, I'd trust toner from a laser printer over ink.

Segwit only blocks covert ASICBOOST when blocks containing segwit transactions are included. Segwit was designed to be backwards compatible and opt-in. As such, miners can maliciously refuse to include segwit transactions.
It does however make it very clear who is using covert ASICBOOST as there are no legitimate reasons for miners to not include segwit transactions.
Hopefully as more people start to switch over to segwit, either pressure will mount and force their hand or a proper fix is implemented and deployed.

Depends on your wallet and if they have updated to allow creating segwit transactions.
You decide for yourself as It's entirely optional. One deciding factor could be lower fees. Segwit transactions will be cheaper than current transaction as the signature witness data is removed from the fee per byte calculation.
How to chose which type of transaction isn't something to worry about now. As we get closer to activation, expect lots of threads discussing this very thing, along with wallet devs explaining how they will implement it.
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:23:03
Full nodes validate, propagate, and broadcast transactions and blocks to peers. They don't affect transaction fees in any way. 
Full nodes do of course help the network, and running your own full node means you don't have to rely on anyone else to use bitcoin.
If you want to get lower fees, consider using segwit transactions. Currently it's a little more involved than standard transactions as most wallet GUIs have not enabled them yet. The fee per byte will remain the same, but the transaction data that's used to calculate it's size is greatly reduced.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:27:57
It's a decent jump, and more of a way to relive pressure while true scaling methods are created. Segwit fixes malleability which lays groundwork for future scaling methods which are far greater than any doubling of blocksize can offer. The capacity increase with segwit is just an added benefit.
Segwit transactions are entirely optional. They are available for those who want, and can be ignored by anyone who doesn't want to use it. Overtime, all transactions may be segwit, but it will have an adoption curve like everything else.
Forcing segwit onto the network would require a hardfork, and in my opinion would be even more controversial than the current softfork variant.

I'd be fine leaving it as opt in but a hardfork allows it to *safely* be mandatory as every node, wallet, and service would have be updated because segwit followed by a hardfork is no longer backwards compatible.
The point I was trying to make is that the risk:reward of a singular change through a hardfork in a non-emergency situation is absolutely not worth it. I will not put support behind any such hardfork.
A hardfork truly needs to reach consensus or it doesn't happen. Trying to force, manipulate, coerce your way through a hardfork will only leave bitcoin weaker and open to future attacks.

Seems like very few people read the full tweet and instead took what was quoted out of context.


Smaller blocks would help keep bitcoin decentralized due to lower hardware/bandwidth requirements and more controlled growth of the blockchain size.


Segwit enables block sizes to go beyond 1MB, but only for segwit transactions. If you avoid using a segwit transaction, the max block size of 1MB remains.


Lightning transactions do not get stored on the blockchain, and do not harm decentralization. By using lightning you can reduce numerous transactions from day to day use to a single open/close transaction using segwit. Although the block could be larger than 1MB, it *should* be saving more blockchain space than it otherwise would using *normal transactions*.

What miners do now, no longer matters (for the next difficulty adjustment) Segwit is locked in. After this difficulty adjustment, we will be in the grace period for activation. It doesn't matter if blocks signal for segwit or not, it's going to activate.
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:07:27
There are simply too few segwit transactions right now to reliably get blocks larger than 1MB.
Most wallets have not yet enabled segwit address generation/spending in their gui. It will take some time before the average user is able to make segwit transactions.
Once the majority of wallets have implemented and enabled segwit support, I'd expect blocks (when transactions are available) to consistently be over 1MB.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:16:54
Still the same, as segwit will only be locked-in, not active. Once it's active the increase in TX will greatly depend on how quickly/many users/wallets implement the ability to create segwit transactions.
The theoretical max blocksize once segwit is active is 4MB. In practice, will likely see around 1.7MB - 2.3MB, or a doubling of TX capacity until LN is rolled out.

It's nothing to do with taking time for new changes to spread through the network. Segwit simply isn't active yet and won't be for a few more weeks.
BIP148, and BIP91 are both designed to make signaling BIP141 (segwit) mandatory, or blocks get rejected.
Both BIP148, and BIP91 are now active and all blocks mined have to signal for BIP141 (segwit.) 
BIP141 has activation periods of 2016 blocks that coincide with difficulty changes and require 95% of all blocks to signal for it to be locked in. Thanks to BIP148/91, BIP141 will lock-in with 100%.
BIP141 will lock-in in roughly 8 days from now. After it's locked in, there will be another difficulty adjustment (2016 blocks, two weeks) before BIP141 activates on the network.
Once it's active in a few weeks, we will begin to see it's effect on the network.

Tumbling/mixing does not always equal laundering or intention of illicit activities. There are numerous reasons to want financial privacy. Bitcoin is very open with transactions all available to the public. If you're not careful paying someone for a sandwich can have the recipient able to pull on the thread of your transaction history and able to identify where you shop, when you shop, and how much potential money you are worth/holding. 
It's somewhat comparable to if every time you used your debit/credit card the merchant was given read-only access to your personal bank/credit account but with names and places changed to alphanumeric strings. By mixing you make your transaction history muddled, difficult to track, and offer little to no idea how much you actually hold.
Sending to your own addresses is not enough as you can still piece together the entire history identifying patterns of your own transactions and coin splitting.

Other than easier backup management, no.
I'd say it's potentially better to have a non-HD wallet. In the event that a non-HD wallet being compromised, the attacker only has access to your history, and the next 100 keys you receive/use as change.
An HD wallet would give an attacker complete access over every address you ever create using that wallet.
This assumes the attacker doesn't immediately move funds, making themselves known. It could be more valuable to sit on a wallet for an extended period of time waiting/watching for a large deposit vs what's immediately available.

No, and this is what makes blacklisting and companies like chainalysis dangerous as they threaten fungibility. A currency needs to be fungible or it cannot succeed.
It's why we need far better privacy built into bitcoin ASAP.
It's recommended to mix your coins as much as possible to ensure the muddled waters remain muddled and blacklists or imposed kyc/aml cannot reliable happen.

It will not lead to centralization. The reason some people shout that it will centralize bitcoin, is because it uses third-party hubs to route transactions around the network.

I'm not sure if there is code waiting for such an emergency, a dev would probably have more insight to quantum protection and contingency plans. 
My assumption is that there would be enough lead-time between a theoretical weakness and an actually exploitable weakness found to give enough time to code and test a solution.
SHA-256 for the foreseeable future is safe. If however quantum computing does ramp up and sha-256 is no longer considered safe, a POW change to an algorithm that is resistant or quantum safe will occur.
There's also the chance that the mining could move to quantum, as it has moved in the past from CPU to GPU to FPGA to ASICS.

Slight copy/paste of past replies on changing the pricing to millibitcoin or microbitcoin.
As long as individual users are given the choice to view or change to whatever unit they prefer we can keep Bitcoin as the default. We don't need to forcefully change the base Bitcoin unit on the network, sites, or wallets as Bitcoin already uses metric prefixes for easily identifiable amounts.
Bitcoin, decibitcoin, centibitcoin, millibitcoin, microbitcoin, satoshi. I'm all for encouraging sites to enable additional units for personal preference. Forcing a default that isn't bitcoin is where I disagree. If you like, you can also express bitcoin using the tonal system, in fact, any pre-existing number system works fine as long as it isn't forced or attempts to replace existing standards.
As for those wanting to skip right to μBTC, It's is called microbitcoin. "Bit" is a terrible name for a unit. It causes far more confusion than understanding. While the existing metric prefix's are used and understood globally. It's much better to keep "bit" as an abbreviation for Bitcoin. This allows a three syllable, easy to say, and easy to recognize units by using prefix + bit. IE decibit, centibit, millibit, microbit. Within context, the prefix becomes all you need to convey the amount. IE deci, centi, milli, micro which can then be shortened further by dropping the last syllable to dess, cent, mill, mike or mic. All of which naturally derives from the full name.

Most assume the same thing and lose their keys when they format or lose their device.
It's always a good idea to write down or print the QR code that appears when adding the TOTP to your authenticator. The original one you scan is the private key and can be restored by re-scanning.

Tell them to research, and understand Bitcoin before they consider *investing*. Make sure they know what it is they are doing, and how to manage their keys.

Fees are not based on the amount you are sending. They are directly related to the amount of data (in bytes) that needs to be permanently stored on the blockchain.

While I get what you're saying and absolutely agree that there are no promises of future profits; you need to keep in mind every large correction in the past has been the result of mostly unforeseen events surrounding centralized exchanges, or government regulatory *threats*. 
Each time these threats, or events occur, the impact has been noticeably less than the times before it. Starting with Gox downtime during high volume, Gox getting hacked, Gox shutting down, China banning bitcoin, regulation concerns and uncertainty, bitstamp hack, bitfinex hack, BTC-e shutdown, bitfinex distancing itself from US customers, etc. Watching the media call bitcoins death is like a real world example of *crying wolf.* It only works so many times before people notice the underlying tech behind bitcoin isn't affected.
Bitcoin itself has always remained sound. It's the events outside of the bitcoin network that have played a role in it's large downward price fluctuations and their impact overall is lessening.

There are numerous ways to encrypt a file, text, etc.
One of the easier, and more flexible methods would be to create an encrypted volume using VeraCrypt. The volume gets mounted and acts like a flash drive to drag and drop files you want encrypted. 
Create a volume with a strong password/phrase, and potentially a keyfile. Losing, altering, or having your keyfile get corrupted in anyway will permanently lock you out of your encrypted volume and may not be best until your more comfortable with the concept. 
Place your sensitive information in the volume (wallet file, seed, etc,) dismount the volume and move it to a usb flash drive or two for secure backup. Keep in mind bitrot does exist, and overtime data will corrupt itself or the flash drive will stop working. Multiple backups are a must.

@_date: 2017-08-19 21:51:18
No, I do not support the 2x hardfork.
Part of the controversy with segwit2x hardfork is that it simply does too little. A hardfork is a massive undertaking and poses a systemic risk to the network making it reckless to implement for a single change. Not to mention the absurdly short time frame to code, test, then push to the network.
A hardfork is a protocol replacement, not a tool to be used for upgrades. Using it for a single change and on this kind of time frame is reckless, controversial, and far too risky in any situation other than an absolute emergency where the cryptography behind bitcoin has been proven weak, or broken.
A hardfork will happen, but it requires potentially years to test and verify. Activation could take another year to ensure the entire network is ready and compatible.
The hardfork must include as many changes and optimizations as possible with the assumption that another hardfork may never happen. There are multiple wishilists for upgrades/improvements that can only be done through a hardfork. Each of those lists must be reviewed and considered. 
If you want me to even consider a hardfork in the near future, as an example, it must include a reliable overt/covert asicboost fix, implement better privacy options, clean segwit code variant, and potentially enforce segwit as the new standard for transactions to maximize scaling.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:05:23
No, quantum computing absolutely has limits. It's exponentially faster than computing power available today, but it's not magic. Bitcoins difficulty algorithm is still more than enough to scale with quantum miners. 
Early days of quantum computing may lead to an issue of private quantum miners vs public available non-quantum miners. At which point the hashing algorithm is changed to avoid that type of situation.

There are zero compatibility issues, and no one is dropping segwit support for over legacy.
Even if everyone stopped using segwit addresses, your segwit transactions are still 100% valid and can be sent/received the same as any other transaction.
An exchange that doesn't use segwit with their front/backend will not cause issue and can't be reject or refused on the network. Segwit is fully backwards compatible in that regard.
The confusion of exchanges dropping support, is for the *segwit 2x* fork. Which despite it's name has nothing to do with segwit.

Why would you want to switch away from using a segwit format address?
Using segwit format addresses has nothing do with with the upcoming controversial fork/attack. Segwit has been activated on the network for sometime now. The new address format among other things will give you lower fees.

Using a segwit format address will give you cheaper fees when you eventually make a transaction. It will also make you ready to take advantage of lightning and other features built off/requiring segwit and its malleability fix.
If you're planning on not moving the coins for a *very very long time* it really won't matter. Both formats are secure and will equally work in the future when it comes time to move your coins.

For security reasons, two factor codes are not stored in your google/sync account. Any service that backs up your two factor codes to the cloud should be avoided.

Not an ELI5, but despite it's name, segwit2x has nothing to do with segwit. It's name is intended to cause confusion.
Segwit is a new transaction format that activated back in August. It works great, and can be used now if your wallet supports it.
The option you are given is if you want to generate future addresses using the new format or not.
Here's some of the benefits to using a segwit address.

Yes, your funds are lost. Treat bitcoin as you would cash. If someone forces you to hand over your cash, it is gone.
There is no recourse, or reversibility in bitcoin. Everything is your own responsibility.
There's also *very* little reason for anyone to carry around several thousands dollars worth of anything in day to day life.
Using Bitcoin means managing your own personal risk levels. Unless you intend to make a large purchase, only keep a couple hundred dollars worth on your phone. The rest of your holding should be secured in cold storage. This would greatly limit your exposure to loss from a stranger in an alley.

Coinbase is a custodial service/wallet, they control your funds. Unfortunately, that means they will send your bitcoin transaction request whenever they feel like it. There is no timeframe between when you make a request, and a transaction is broadcast to the network.
Usually it doesn't take long, but the past day or two coinbase has been having stability issues which might cause further delays.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:46:32
The error you're getting is from the electrum server you are connected to. Its set up to reject double spends, as most are. You can try to broadcast through other electrum servers and hope to find one that will accept the new transaction.
I'm not sure I can provide too much help as I've never had to create a double spend transaction for a low fee without RBF. it just might be best to wait it out.
If you post the raw transaction, someone may be able to broadcast it for you through their node.

Drop the powerlimit and you'd be surprised how little strain it actually puts on the GPU. Most component damage is due to hot/cold cycles from ramping up and down in games, or day to day workloads. Mining keeps the temps steady with no issue of damage outside of an already defective GPU.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:16:22
What wallet are you using to broadcast the double spend? Did you have RBF enabled?
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:06:04
A basic double spend doesn't need the same output(s) as there are no specific rules that allow some double spends, but not others. Either it gets accepted as a valid transaction, or the receiving node/server rejects it.
Most pushtx sites don't want to be abused for double spends and auto reject if the input is already in the mempool. 
I believe you can add the transaction to your own full node, which would then attempt to broadcast to all its peers which may accept or reject it. Even if the double spend attempt gets propagated across most of the network, a miner/pool would still need to have their custom rules set to accept the transaction. This reduces the number of miners willing to mine the double spend and in theory limits the amount of hashrate working towards your double spend making it possible for the low fee transaction to confirm before the higher fee.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:37:16
Uh, no.. You can and should backup by printing the page or writing the key down when enabling two factor. Many sites also allow you to generate several single use OTP keys in the event you never made backups and can't access your account.
I wouldn't advocate for anyone use a custodial wallet to store their bitcoin keys. Storing your two factor keys in an online account is no different.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:52:01
Should be hours, not days unless they messed up fee estimation. If you have a TXID, it's already been broadcast and is waiting to be included in a block which is dependent on the fee.
Some exchanges, which I'm assuming quad is one of them, require at least 6 confirmations before they credit your account.

Slight copy/paste of past replies on changing the pricing to millibitcoin or microbitcoin.
As long as individual users are given the choice to view or change to whatever unit they prefer we can keep Bitcoin as the default. We don't need to forcefully change the base Bitcoin unit on the network, sites, or wallets as Bitcoin already uses metric prefixes for easily identifiable amounts.
Bitcoin, decibitcoin, centibitcoin, millibitcoin, microbitcoin, satoshi. I'm all for encouraging sites to enable additional units for personal preference. Forcing a default that isn't bitcoin is where I disagree. If you like, you can also express bitcoin using the tonal system, in fact, any pre-existing number system works fine as long as it isn't forced or attempts to replace existing standards.
As for those wanting to skip right to μBTC, It's is called microbitcoin. "Bit" is a terrible name for a unit. It causes far more confusion than understanding. The existing metric prefix's are used and understood globally. It's much better to keep "bit" as an abbreviation for Bitcoin. This allows a three syllable, easy to say, and easy to recognize units by using prefix + bit. IE decibit, centibit, millibit, microbit. Within context, the prefix becomes all you need to convey the amount. IE deci, centi, milli, micro which can then be shortened further by dropping the last syllable to dess, cent, mill, mike or mic. All of which naturally derives from the full name.

If you look at what you're referring to as past *bubbles* remember **why** the price pulled back the way it did. Every major correction was the result of a large negative event within/surrounding Bitcoin.
We have not had a negative event, if anything the future is brighter than it ever has been for Bitcoin. Right now the people feeding into the correction are those who look at how Bitcoin performed in the past based solely on price charts. They aren't aware of hacks, exchange downtime or shutdown, regulation, bans, etc.
I'd expect the price to stay around where it is for the next few days and into next week, then start breaking more ATHs soon thereafter.

The sidebar should have good up to date information.
In general the best thing you could do would be to buy a hardware wallet. That way your private keys *never* touch the internet and can't be stolen, hacked, or locked in on site/exchange. If someone wants to steal from you, they need to physically get their hands on you and your wallet, or your backup.
With a hardware wallet you are given a backup seed phrase that can restore your coins if you loose or break the hardware wallet. One of the better places to secure your backup seed phrase would be in a bank/credit union safety deposit box.
If your seed is well encrypted or fragmented with *m of n* you can make multiple copies to store in different physical locations for redundancy.

Electrum will be easier because you can manually chose which server you connect to. Selecting between a server on each coin will give you access to both.

Good answer, it's part of why using the same address twice is a bad idea as it exposes the public key when you sign/broadcast the transaction.

Enable coin control in your wallet settings.
Once enabled, when you go to the Send tab to create a transaction you will have a new button you can click called "*Inputs*"
The inputs menu has a list of every address you've received bitcoin with, and each of the inputs associated with them. You can pick and choose as many, or as little as like to to make sure your transaction only includes a specific set of inputs.
This can reduce fees by using only a single input, or ignoring *dust* that you may have. It can also help improve your privacy by enabling you to keep various addresses and inputs separate.

Nope, because honestly, I don't care about the price. If the price is all you care about, the uncertainty from the fork is already priced in. The price will decrease further if the fork looks more likely to occur, and should increase as support for the fork continues to fall.
I also believe the price is *currently* suppressed due this, and the previous fork/attacks. The recent activation of Segwit alleviated some uncertainty and was likely the catalyst for the recent ATH. After all this segwit2x fork is done and failed, I'd expect a similar increase as uncertainty lessens.. until the next fork attack starts ;)

Fees directly correlate to the size of the transaction in bytes, and has nothing to do with the amount being transferred.

As absurd and insane as it would be to change POW now; It needs to be said that this sort of scorched earth plan only works once.
Whatever you knock mining back to, whether gpu, cpu, fpga, or whatever, you only get to do it effectively once.
Yes, you kill off current ASICS, but once those same miners you fought so hard to destroy rebuild their farms outfit with GPUs, a POW change is no longer effective as you can't practically obsolete their farms. 
Taking such a hostile approach also strengthens resentment from those who built up trust in the underlying mining protocol. Previously friendly miners, may rebuild larger and with more nefarious or disruptive intentions.

Not even close to an emergency. The network is, and has remained fully functional despite claims that the sky is falling.
Here's what an emergency hardfork situation looks like 
Unless SHA-256 or ECDSA are broken, remote arbitrary code execution is discovered, multiple valid blocks have suddenly been replaced with new ones, or something unforeseen on a similar scale occurs then it's not an emergency. 
Any hardfork proposal that isn't an emergency needs to go through proper channels, discussions, debates, testing, etc and gain consensus long before code is finalized and pushed to users.

*Part* of the controversy with segwit2x is that it simply does too little to justify a hardfork. 
A hardfork is a massive undertaking and poses a systemic risk to the network making it reckless to implement for a single change. Not to mention the absurdly short time frame to code, test, then push to the network.
A hardfork is a protocol replacement, not a tool to be used for upgrades. Using it for a single change and on this kind of time frame is reckless, controversial, and far too risky in any situation other than an absolute emergency where the cryptography behind bitcoin has been proven weak, or broken.
A hardfork will happen, but it requires potentially years to test and verify. Activation could take another year to ensure the entire network is ready and compatible.
The next planned hardfork must include as many changes and optimizations as possible with the assumption that another hardfork may never happen. There are multiple wishilists for upgrades/improvements that can only be done through a hardfork. Each of those lists must be reviewed and considered.

Pretty much, but with a much smaller bounty. Quantum computing could brute force the private key from the exposed public key but it's not magic and will still take a lot of time. It could potentially take upwards of a year or more for a single address. 
Satoshi's coins are in separate addresses containing 50 BTC each from early mining. There isn't a single massive address to attack.
There has been proposals to lock satoshis coins due to being weak to quantum once it becomes a legitimate threat, but it was quickly attacked as being more *core* censorship bs and never got the needed discussion or debate.
Assuming quantum computing doesn't jump in computation faster than expected. I think it's fine to have satoshi's coins slowly get *found* in 50 btc chunks at a rate of once or twice a year. It could act as a serious bounty to push the advancement of quantum computing as a whole. It really doesn't become an issue until the time it takes to get a private key is down to days or even hours instead of months or years.
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:13:37
It wouldn't be massive, but it would definitely be more than 1 satoshi making it not worth while regardless of the price.
Briefly looking at the address, it has 4 inputs. To create a sweeping transaction with 4 inputs, 1 output the size should be 636 bytes. Without those two spam transactions, the size would be 340 bytes.

A hardfork to change the POW could be considered an emergency situation and potentially less controversial. At this time I wouldn't support a POW change either. Assuming it was a singular change until it can be proven to be an emergency situation that Bitcoin cannot recover from.


S2X is absolutely irresponsible in nearly every way you look at it. Take your pick, from the time frame, being a singular change, unnecessary/inadequate changes, lack of replay protection, no roadmap, questionable backroom dealing, etc.
S2X is a hardfork for the sake of hardforking. It's an effort to further the goal of *firing* the current decentralized developers (anyone can contribute) and centralizing control of development and future direction of bitcoin (only whitelisted developers will be allowed to contribute).

The QR, sequence of numbers, sticker etc are what hold value.
Bitcoin is digital, but can be stored physically as key (string of numbers and letters.)

To spend, you remove the sticker and reveal the key to redeem it to your digital wallet.

No, it's not instant. Coinbase is  a custodial wallet which can have any number of unforeseen issues and delays. 
When you *make a transaction* using coinbase, you're really making a request for them to send the funds credited to your account.
You have no actual control over the keys, and therefore cannot broadcast or create transactions yourself.
Coinbase is usually good with time to fulfill and broadcast a transaction, but it's definitely not instant and delays can happen.

Core is a safe wallet relatively speaking, but it's not safe from the 2x fork due to it's lack of replay protection.

A fork occurs when a change in the code causes Bitcoin to no longer be compatible with itself. Without 100% consensus (ie, everyone running the new code change), it will split the network and create two versions based on the support level of each. It causes confusion, chaos, can suppress the price, and overall can weaken Bitcoin.

No, all blocks mined after 2011 pay to pubkey-hash. A public key is only exposed when you sign/broadcast a transaction. It's why reusing addresses is discouraged as it weakens the security model of bitcoin. 
Early in Bitcoins development, newly mined blocks were paid to directly to pubkey effectively exposing all dormant coins prior to the fix.

80% of *pool operators* not individual miners. Futures markets have the price/success expectation at only 15%. 
If that's not enough, remember, there are no miners running software with the hardfork waiting to be activated through a threshold, flagday, or other activation method. 
They are running the current core consensus code, while adding a meaningless text to their blocks saying they *intend* to follow an agreement to fork at an undetermined time. Said agreement was never set in stone, and has been altered, broken, and changed multiple times, while still not being finalized. It's prudent to say those who are *"signalling"* may no longer fully agree to what the agreement has become and don't actually intend to switch their mining nodes without community consensus when the time comes.

I'm currently unaware of a reliable method for splitting. You need to find a way to invalidate the transaction on one chain, but not the other. Making a transaction with dust may have it confirm quicker on one chain than the other allowing you to quickly double spend the unconfirmed transaction.
Once you have an input that is valid on one chain, and not valid the other you can start to include it with all transactions to reliably split.

Yeah, it can easily take a few days to a week on a standard HDD. Honestly I wouldn't bother with a bootstrap file as it doesn't speed up the sync time by any meaningful amount. Bootstraps are only useful when bandwidth is restricted and you can get it as a physical copy. I've seen my fair share of problems as well. A full node doesn't always run smoothly, I've had several instances where I've needed to rebuild the entire blockchain due to corruption, crashes, etc. Stability has gotten much better, but unexpected downtime can happen at anytime. Keeping a backup of bitcoin once it's synced can definitely help save time as you only need to re-sync up to your last backup.

How controversial a hardfork is, makes all the difference... Miners don't dictate the network or protocol.


Wow, a hardfork is ***never*** a compromise.


The drama will never stop, bitcoin will always be under attack in some form or another including constant controversial hardfork attempts.
Core does not somehow get a pass. If Core was pushing S2X, there would be similar, if not the exact same backlash. It's a useless, impotent hardfork that cannot be sanely justified in its current state.


You are vastly overestimating Core's ability to dictate bitcoin. The reason it appears like they have control over the network, is due to them taking a superior direction when it comes to coding practices and what they focus on. The majority of core's changes get included because they are good, useful ideas which have been well tested.


That "simple" change breaks the network, and forces everyone onto a single new standard. There is nothing simple about forcing every bitcoin client, user, and service to upgrade because there is no backwards compatibility. A newly found bug or exploit in the code would be able to cripple the entire network as everyone would be running the same version of Bitcoin.


I never said anything about blockchain bloat, or rate of growth. Remember, it's 2X, not 2mb. Blocks can already be larger than 2mb and 2x would bring it to a potential max of 8mb per block.


No, it's actually the opposite. Anyone can contribute to the core project. A bad idea may get rejected, laughed at, and cause the creator/supporter to become butthurt (see bitcoinXT) but there is nothing preventing anyone from participating. The S2x project is locked down and whitelisted to prevent any input from people outside their group/supporters.


I cannot reiterate enough a hardfork is ***never*** a compromise.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:16:07
And you're underestimating the individuals that will switch. This is besides the point though, the pools are not running mining nodes with a hardfork built in waiting to be activated through a signal threshold, flagday, or any other means of activation. 
They are still running on the core consensus codebase. It is yet to be seen if any of these pools that are "signaling" will actually run said software.
S2X doesn't need to be *called off* for it not to happen, as there are no miners running it's codebase. Pools that are adding that bit of text to their blocks would still need to organize, and upgrade their mining nodes to S2X once its finalized.

Bitcoin block times are solved using a poison distribution method. Meaning there will times where several blocks can be solved in a short time, or very few over a long time.
Currently we've only had 3 blocks in the last hour and a half instead of the estimated 9.
If you post the transaction ID, people can take a look and see if there any issues with why it hasn't been included in a block yet.

I was against it then, and I'm against it now. The name did not *stick*, if it had, it would be universally used but it's not.

It really isn't a possibility and lacks any real support. The few supporters it does have, are just loud.
A price drop is very likely in my opinion. Uncertainty created by various forks can easily suppress markets. I'd argue the price has been suppressed due to looming forks and attacks for awhile now.
Once the fork fails (and it will), expect uncertainty to start to disappear with a price increase. I wouldn't be surprised to see something similar to the price breakaway we saw following segwits activation.
Even though I expect a price drop, it could happen after we cross new all time highs, and may end up dropping to a price that is higher than where it is today.

It's not premature or opinionated to call the coin after a hardfork an altcoin. It's forking off the original chain without complete consensus, making it by definition an alternative chain. The moment you break consensus, is the moment you create an alt.

I'm not sure with coinspace, every wallet is different. Some don't allow you to change the priority, or manually enter a transaction fee.
There will always be a fee. The fee is what incentives miners to include your transaction in the blockchain. The fee varies from day to day based on how many transactions are waiting in the mempool and the fee they paid. In general miners include the highest fee transactions first and work their way down. 
A transaction to yourself that isn't high priority can be sent with a lower than average fee but it may take sometime (potentially days) for miners to include it if there is a lot of demand.
To manage my transactions I mostly use bitcoin core, and armory as it gives full control over every aspect of each transaction. That includes sweeping a paper wallet, full segwit implementation (lower fees), and a whole host of security measures that I appreciate and use.
It's not a wallet for everyone as it requires the full blockchain to be downloaded and maintained.

It depends on various nodes, wallets, and rebroadcasting rules. Each has their own mempool expiration time and rules for when to drop *old* unconfirmed transactions.


Disabling RBF does not secure zero confirmation transactions in any way. Despite what *some* say, RBF did not weaken or kill zero confirmation transactions. They've always been weak and susceptible to being double spent and/or replaced. Unlike the blockchain, nodes don't maintain a persistent or identical mempool. When restarted, most nodes clear their local mempool and build a new mempool using new transactions they receive from their peers. In addition, most nodes will not rebroadcast old transactions unless configured to do so, or requested.
If your wallet is not regularly rebroadcasting the transaction, it will either disappear from the network overtime as nodes restart, or your wallets expiration rule activates and makes the inputs spendable again.


The *fix* for your transaction could have been importing the private key into a wallet with full control, zapping/clearing transactions if its mempool updates with the current *stuck* transaction. Once imported, create and broadcast the new transaction using the same input. The transaction could also be reconstructed offline without worrying about your local mempool, then broadcast to the network at anytime as long as the initial transaction is still unconfirmed.

Futures markets exist by creating equivalent tokens for price discovery and to show market sentiment. Even though the coins don't exist, you can still trade for, or against them. You lock your Bitcoin on such an exchange offering these futures, and get the token representation to trade. When the fork happens the token is converted based on your holdings.

An unconfirmed transaction is exactly what it sounds like with all the associated risks of the merchant not getting paid for the product. The transaction has been seen, but is unconfirmed and may never confirm. This can be both intentionally, and accidentally abused. 
An example of someone accidentally abusing it would be due to poor fee calculation/low fee and the transaction gets dropped after a few days.
Intentionally abusing an unconfirmed transaction a user can *pay,* receive the *coffee*, then double spend the transaction to another wallet essentially stealing. This works best by paying a slightly below average fee to give the appearance of a high likelihood of confirming while providing a large enough delay to get a higher fee double spend transaction confirmed.

Nope, short forms of microbitcoin include μ/uBTC, μ/ubit mics, mikes, etc, but never "bit."
"Bit" is a terrible name for a unit for anything other than Bitcoin. It causes far more confusion than understanding. Bitcoin uses existing metric prefix's which are used and understood globally. It's much better to keep bit as an abbreviation for Bitcoin. This allows a three syllable, easy to say, and easy to recognize units by using prefix + bit. IE decibit, centibit, millibit, microbit.
Within context, the prefix becomes all you need to convey the amount. IE deci, centi, milli, micro which can then be shortened further by dropping the last syllable to dess, cent, mill, mike or mic. All of which naturally derives from the full name.

It means nothing, there is no voting, or signaling threshold actually taking place.

Malleability may not have been the sole cause, but it was enough to push the exchange beyond it's point of breaking. I wouldn't doubt it if they were running on a fractional reserve since the 2011 hack.. The run up in price only amplified the rate at which they went from a bad spot to a worse one.

Memory intense algorithms are more common today, but the current mining situation also offers dual mining. Two algorithms at once which has comparative power consumption to the days of bitcoin/litecoin mining despite lower clocks. Bitcoin and litecoin mining also had a large emphasis with finding a balance between core and memory clocks, not just pushing everything to the max.
Even when bitcoin was mined on GPUs, it was of great importance to keep the temps low. High temps = instability = downtime = loss of funds.
Most of the GPU's during those times ran hotter, and used more power because of their inefficiencies. Those 4850, 5850, 6950 cards all had high TDP by today's standard.
But I do agree, mining then vs now is different and not directly comparable. This image was made for how mining is today so I'm referencing current mining for wear and tear on GPUs vs gaming. 
It still stands that running a card at a constant power level and temp vs frequent power and temp cycles will generally allow the card to last longer.

Segwit is BIP141, it requires 95% of blocks to signal during a 2016 block difficulty adjustment period to lock in. Then another 2016 blocks to activate on the network. The time between lock-in and activation is required for users to update and prepare for the changes.
BIP91 (locked in, activating soon) and BIP148 are not implementations of Segwit. Rather they are designed to activate segwit through BIP141. They do this by rejecting 100% of all blocks that don't signal for BIP141.
Segwit will not be active until block 481824.

Is there any way to check the transactions included in an antpool mined block against the previous mempool of various nodes?
ASIC Boost relies on knowing ahead of time what transactions will be included in the next block before it's mined. This can be achieved by mining empty blocks, or including transactions that were never broadcast externally to give the appearance of legitimacy.
Monitoring and comparing what gets included/never before seen transactions in blocks could give some insight whether ASIC Boost is being used.

BIP91 is *locked in* not *active*. Once BIP91 is active, all non-segwit/bit 1 blocks will be rejected by miners.

I don't know, I've seen gamers push their cards to extremes that would make a miner shudder.
Mining is about creating the most efficient and stable environment. This includes undervolting, downclocking, etc. An unstable card results in downtime and time is money. It's far more likely for a farm to favor lower hashrate and better GPU longevity and uptime over max temps, poor efficiency, and crashes.
The most frequent cause of a dead GPUs outside of manufacturing defect are from frequent power/thermal cycling cracking the solder balls in the BGA chip. Gaming has a higher tendency to damage cards than mining with it's steady power and thermals. Then take into account how many gamers overclock for that extra bit of performance, pushing their cards beyond 100% stable and you vastly increase the likely hood of a dead GPU.
I'd rather buy a GPU from an experienced miner, than from a gamer with unknown variables and frequent power/thermal cycling. Sure the card has been heavily used for mining but it's been run in such a way that is to preserve hardware.
Now if only my well priced back ordered rx 580 would ship that'd be great.

Today, Segwit.
Segwit does far more than a hardfork with a single change to double the blocksize ever could.
Part of the controversy with things like segwit2x, or just a hardfork alone is that the hardfork simply does too little for the massive undertaking and risk to the network to make it worth it. Not to mention the absurdly short time frame to code, then push to the network. 
A hardfork is a protocol replacement, not an upgrade. Using it for a single change and on this kind of time frame is reckless, controversial, and far too risky in any situation other than an absolute emergency where the cryptography behind bitcoin has been proven weak, or broken.
A hardfork will happen, but it requires potentially years to test and verify. Activation could take another year to ensure the entire network is ready and compatible. 
The hardfork must include as many changes and optimizations as possible with the assumption that another hardfork may never happen.

Segwit itself isn't much of a scaling *solution*. It brings the max theoritical blocksize to 4MB, 4 times the current limit.

If you were interested, Bitcoin uses the metric prefix's for unit names. When/if the times comes that we need to subdivide further, we can change from the current 10^-8 commonly referred to as a Satoshi; down to 10^-12 to get nanobitcoin, and picobitcoin units.
I have to add that we should never force, or push changes of the base unit on users, network, exchanges, wallets, etc.

You don't need to mine to make a difference. Every additional node to the network makes difference. By running a node that either accepts, rejects, or enforces a ruleset/change shows support and intent.
Running a Core node will reject any incompatible blocks IE hardfork related changes. 
Running a UASF node will not only reject incompatible blocks, but adds a new rule to reject any block that doesn't signal Segwit.
There is no mining involved.

Yes, funds will go to those who were hit by losses in order to be *"made whole."* However, legally their losses are defined and locked in at a low fiat valuation. Being made whole does not equal 1 BTC lost in Gox, then 1 BTC received after payout. 
MtGox was almost able to repay everyone as the price approached $3000 USD because the amount owed is in fiat. Anything Mark does to try and make people whole for their exact Bitcoin loss is done on his own and will likely face other legal issues if he isn't able to do it in a provably fair way.

You are incorrect if you believe the extra cash *and* bitcoin will go to the creditors. The creditors are owed a specific amount in fiat, and only fiat at a locked price per bitcoin that is far lower than it is today.

I'd say 60 vs 62 could make a difference. It may not have much of an impact on peak fps, but your average and minimum frames may be higher giving an overall better experience. If you're only aiming for 60, you should consider an upgrade to a 120, or 144 refresh rate monitor. The difference between 60 and 120 or 144 is subtle at first, but becomes night and day the more you use it.
If you mined with your fans on 100% while near the tjmax, I'd question your knowledge of sustained, or even hobbyist farm mining. Sounds like you had an enclosed gaming PC and just ran a miner without too much thought in cooling solutions. GPU fans shouldn't go above 80%, with an upper limit of 85%. After that you get diminishing returns for cooling, more noise, and much more stress added to the fans and fan header.
Instead of pushing GPU fans to max, you should have been opting for better airflow and lower ambient temperature.

I know, but this post is in relation to MtGox operating *willy bot* which wasn't the cause for loss of funds. I also don't believe it was the cause for the $1000 run up. Willy bot was long known to be internal since the leaked docs after Gox went down. It may not have been on the record, but it was at least highly regarded as an internal trading bot.
The bitcoin loss, as reported initially by MtGox was that the funds were wiped out by abuse of the malleability bug which they weren't checking for. Exchange accounts didn't require much in terms of validation until you wanted to move fiat. all it took was for someone malicious to set up a new account behind a VPN and deposit a few Bitcoin, then withdraw them without ever trading.
Once the withdrawal was processed, they could use transaction malleability to change the transaction ID then file a claim that they never received their coins. The automated system would then check ID and resend. Over time this was used to drain the cold wallets as they refilled hot wallets without doing a system audit.
Incompetence sure, but I withhold judgement on intent or malice.

Google authenticator saves **locally only**. There are no accounts or backups of your seed tokens. If you lose your phone you lose the ability to enter your 2FA locked accounts. Even using a google service account, for security reasons nothing from the authenticator is backed up.
There are two ways  to restore your 2FA if you lose your phone.
1. Everytime you enter/scan a new seed (add a new token) either print that page, or write it down. It's a master seed that you can rescan/enter into any device at any time and regain 2FA.
2. Root your device and do a full backup of the google authenticator app and/or entire device. If you lose your phone, get a new one, root it, then restore your backup.
The first is by far the easiest and most recommended method. Keep in mind there is no additional security with the seed, make sure you store it safely and securely.

You don't need to spend them. You mix them. Repeatedly. Imagine if all the heavy spam over the past was not an attack, new users, or increased demand. Perhaps it's all from darknetmarket mixers which are actively mixing the Gox coins.  (There's actually a lot of reason to believe at least some of the large transaction backlog was created by mixers.)
All coins should have disseminated throughout the entire network. Any link to the theft should have been broken years ago and attempting to seize suspected *treasure* breaks fungibility as the current owner is unlikely to be the thief. 
Coins in your wallet have a high likelihood of containing some *taint* back to the original Gox address, or perhaps another *crime.* Who's to say those tainted coins aren't from mixing, but rather it points to you as the thief. Clearly your wallet is a treasure trove as someone could navigate back from your coin inputs to the initial theft.

A "*good"* rope varies and depends on it's application.
With the timing of this post and what it's insinuating, a chain may be a more appropriate.. symbolically at least. ;)

I was using bitcoin during the March 2013 fork. I even made transactions during it, there wasn't any downtime. I will preface, this was several years ago now and I may not remember precisely the events as they took place.
From what I recall, there wasn't as much confusion and panic in the community as some people would have you believe. The price drop that followed caused more noise than the actual split. The *fork* had nearly identical transactions broadcast across both chains. The few transactions that were only on the forked chain simply re-entered the mempool once reconnected with rest of the network. There's also the chance they stayed confirmed as the original chain didn't stop, it just slowed due to loss of miners running the backwards incompatible version of bitcoin.
There was zero network downtime during March 2013. The network continued working throughout without issue.
The fork only affected nodes/miners running the latest version which triggered the bug. It did not halt the entire network.
Transactions still continued and confirmed on the *primary* original chain albeit slower due to loss of hashrate.
If you're looking for downtime, I'd say the August 2010 vulnerability exploit was a bigger issue as it affected the entire network, not just the nodes/miners running the latest version.

That's should be enough. If you're wanting to accept incoming connections, make sure you forward port 8333, or have UPnP enabled.
If the three computers are all on the same network, you may have to do some port changes on each device (default 8333) and forward them in your router.
Outside of redundancy and limited hardware capabilities, running multiple nodes from a single location doesn't *really* help the network. You'd be fine just running a single node with more connections slots available.

Who cares, they are gone. I don't believe anyone close to this case has control over those coins let alone Mark.
An expensive lesson well learned. Don't keep large amounts of funds on an exchange.
Best thing to happen now, is wait and hope the bankruptcy, and coinlabs stalling is put to an end and creditors can get repaid with the recovered holdings. The value of accounts is in fiat and priced at a much lower price than today. Sudden recovery of 650k Bitcoin will not see creditors holding their original Bitcoin balance.

You *stop* it by not running it. It's hardfork that **requires** every participant to switch to or else it has no value.
You can also run a UASF node, although not explicitly core, it's designed to enforce and activate segwit which you can then switch back to a core node.

It's unlikely it will, I for one do not support it, and won't run it's code.
A new client/update would need to be rolled out that includes 2x code and gain network consensus.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:02:00
That's not a good thing.
A 65% miner collusion with a sudden contentious hardfork would result in a longer chain. Hashrate alone does not dictate what is or isn't Bitcoin. The legacy chain is *always* Bitcoin until there is 100% consensus that it is not. Basing what is bitcoin based solely on the hashrate is an extremely dumb thing to do, let alone announce as an exchange.

If you pay the correct amount on August 1st and they receive it on August 1st, your part is done. 
It's on the recipient to either hold, or sell for their local fiat currency.
It's not unreliable, it's a floating value. Just as if you were paying someone from Canada in USD. You pay the amount agreed upon, it's up to them to then exchange it the USD for CAD. It doesn't matter what price movements occurred between the time for them to exchange it.
Honestly, if the person you're paying in Bitcoin is unable to receive then send to an exchange and sell within a couple hours, they have a poor set up.

I wonder if their partners/investors would agree.. oh yeah.. right.. hmm..
Well it seems right on track for any company associated with Bitmain.

It wasn't a re-org. The fork chain was dropped, the original chain remained untouched.
It was two simultaneous existing chains that were not compatible with each other. The primary original chain continued mining as it had been previous to the fork. When the fork chain was dropped. When reconnected to the main network, confirmations on the fork chain were rebroadcast to the mempool. Some transactions had already and remained confirmed as they were broadcast between both chains.

Segwit2x (8mb) is in no way a *compromise*. It's a hardfork combined with a softfork. You get the worst of both, and none of their specific benefits.
@_date: 2017-07-11 15:38:30


Shockingly, it could. They have frozen assets in bitcoin which weren't liquidated and creditors are owed a locked in price per bitcoin in fiat. If the price of bitcoin goes high enough, creditors could be made whole while the company could still have enough to relaunch. Something something, name recognition..


I wouldn't call it a *treasure* hunt as finding those would have similar effect to finding the 10,000 bitcoin pizza coins. It's interesting to follow and study, but finding the end of the trail wont earn you anything. You can't seize funds from whoever has them, it's also likely a large amount of them have been disseminated throughout the market and are no longer in the hands of the original thief. Yay fungibility.

No, it wasn't older than Gox, however, it didn't crash at every rally or dump. BTC-e came online in July 2011 only a year later than Mt.Gox.
I feel bad for people thinking this means their Gox loss will be reimbursed, it wont. The Gox case had everyone's loss locked in at a specific fiat price way below current day trading. Any funds returning to Gox will be used in their coinlabs lawsuit/settlement and potentially used to rebuild and relaunch the exchange.
