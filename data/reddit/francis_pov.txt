As long as answers like this are given to "newbies," Bitcoin will never go mainstream.

Join the club. I had made small orders (under $100) with Amagi for about a year or so with no real problems, and back in February I decided to make a larger (yet still pretty small ~$5,000) order with them. Big mistake - it was a nightmare. After waiting about four weeks with no response, I started emailing them, which led them to sending small parts of the order to pacify me. I received the final part of the order in late March, and only after many, many complaints and inquiries. 
Throughout the process, their customer service told outright lies and kept promising deliveries that never happened. They also promised that they would soon be implementing a new system to improve their shipping delays. Glad to see it is working so well...not.
I also received the "review this item" request before I even received the item. 
Needless to say, I will not be returning as a customer to them. Ever.

Bread wallet - simple to setup and simple to use. Only works on an iPhone, however.

The part about "or perhaps low-level Amazon support doesn't know what Bitcoin is!" should have made it clear that I wasn't trying to imply what you thought I was trying to imply.

But you did just give all your personal information and credit card info to someone that is clearly not trustworthy.
I think the trust factor applies to both CC and bitcoin payments. In neither case is it a good idea to send money to untrustworthy people/companies. The bad results are different, but they are both bad.
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:44:38
And to be clear what I was implying: I thought it was funny that some low-level support flunky is promising to make Amazon accept bitcoin.

I got out of software a few years ago and sold the company. The business mostly sold to government agencies, so I doubt it is accepting bitcoin at this point.

It is stored at Coinbase, which means it is almost definitely not stored in one individual address on the blockchain.

Bitcoin is about the free market, without a centralizing control. And the free market has decided that services like Coinbase and Circle are useful. If they were not useful, they wouldn't exist, because there are no bail-outs in Bitcoin.
I have used Circle and Coinbase numerous times to easily and cheaply purchase bitcoins, and I've never had a problem. I've also moved my coins out to my own wallet as soon as I receive them. This is a useful service to me and to many others, and I'm glad it exists. 
I for one appreciate that the Bitcoin market has freely developed without any central authority directing it, including central authorities who would like to define what we "should be using".

Every visionary gets told that his ideas are "not possible." So does every crackpot. The only way to prove which one you are is to try to make it happen. 
For years I had my own software company, and lots of people would say that they would love to do that if they could. I would just reply, "Why can't you?"
Instead of asking questions about what you can do to help, dive in and starting making your ideas a reality.

I think Breadwallet is perfectly easy to use and "just works."  You just need to enter a 4-digit pin to access it, which takes about 2 seconds to enter. Yes, you have to keep an offline recovery key, but that is not need when you are in line at the store.
Anything easier than a 4-digit code seems to just be asking for trouble.

I am running 10.6.8, and it does upgrade to 4.3.25, but it still shows the vulnerability. The reason is that the test command was still using /bin/bash even though I did a chsh command. 
$ echo $BASH_VERSION
$ env x='() { :;}; echo Vulnerable' bash -c "echo This is a test"
This is a test
So I ran the test command with a direct call to the new bash:
$ env x='() { :;}; echo Vulnerable' /usr/local/bin/bash -c "echo This is a test"
/usr/local/bin/bash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt
/usr/local/bin/bash: error importing function definition for `x'
This is a test
Then I did a "which bash" to see what is the default path for bash:
$ which bash
So even though I did a chsh to the new bash, it was still calling from /bin/bash.
I decided to move /bin/bash and then link the new bash to /bin/bash:
$ sudo cp /bin/bash /bin/bash.old
$ sudo rm /bin/bash
$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash
Then I tested it:
$ env x='() { :;}; echo Vulnerable' bash -c "echo This is a test"
bash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt
bash: error importing function definition for `x'
This is a test
I still have to do some more checking to see if I'm still vulnerable, but hopefully this will do the trick.

* Yes, chargebacks are an issue. But I would guess there will be many solutions, both technical and corporate, in the near future to resolve this issue.
* You are not vulnerable to *additional* scams, just different ones. Identity theft is greatly reduced, for example.
* This is not really true in real-life. I've never bought something online with bitcoin that didn't take less than a few seconds. If the charge isn't that large (less than $1,000 for example), most merchants will just push the transaction through without confirmations.
* This is just due to where we are in the adoption curve. There was a time CC's were not readily available. Over time, the ability to obtain bitcoin will become much easier, and this issue will decrease.

My understanding is that they do use the same basic mechanisms for creating addresses, but Bitcoin prefixes a "1" and Litecoin prefixes an "L".
However, for multi-sig addresses, they both prefix a "3", which means you can have the same address, like in this case. 
But I could be completely wrong in my understanding.

Technically, inflation and deflation refer to the money supply: inflation means the money supply has increased, deflation means it has decreased. Often people say that inflation/deflation means prices have gone up/down, but this is a *result* of inflation/deflation.
Bitcoin is technically inflationary now, because the supply is increasing, but it is called deflationary for two reasons:
(1) Relative to most fiat currencies, which increase their supply significantly over time, Bitcoin's supply is going down.
(2) With lost addresses and the supply increases going down over time, eventually Bitcoin's supply will go down, making it truly deflationary.

People need to stop missing the forest for the trees. The example that Mr. Tucker gave was from a movie in order draw in the reader. Legacy money-transmitting systems have existed for decades, but because of technical inefficiencies and government regulations, they are unable to do something that should be simple in 2015: transmit large amounts of money quickly and cheaply. Really, most of our fiat money is stored digitally, so why is it so hard to move?
With Bitcoin, which has only be around for 6 years, we have the potential for a system which can transmit very large amounts of money very quickly and very cheaply. This is revolutionary, and we shouldn't get hung up on little details and miss the big picture.

I wouldn't say "delays don't really change the day-to-day user experience". When I bought the Gyft card last night using Breadwallet, Gyft did not release the card to me until the payment was confirmed - hours after I had ordered it. Because I follow Bitcoin news I knew why this was, so it was no big deal. But if my wife, for example, had to experience this she would be very worried that something was wrong and "Why can't I download my gyft card I bought?"
I love Breadwallet and recommend it highly, and I look forward to your next update to solve this problem, but we should always consider the novice user when it comes to the user experience. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:16:50
I wouldn't say it is "useless." I used it just last night to buy something from Gyft, and, although it took longer than normal, it was confirmed within a few hours.

Right, because Satoshi gave control of the project to a guy who just fixed *typos*.

I think you give Krugman too much credit. There is a saying, "An idea so dumb only a college professor would accept it." Krugman is the archetype of that saying.
But more importantly, Krugman's flaw (and it is his calling-card flaw) is that he takes a new idea, applies it to the current system, and then assumes that *nothing else will change*. So something like the Internet won't be viable because it doesn't fit into the current way of doing things. But of course the Internet fundamentally changed how things are done.
Likewise with Bitcoin. He simply sees it in the paradigm he is used to: state-run central banks being trusted by everyone and being in control of everything. In that paradigm, Bitcoin appears to him as just "digital dollars", which of course we already have. But Bitcoin is a whole new way of doing money, and it has the ability to change all the underlying assumptions of money. 
The core benefit of Bitcoin isn't that it reduces transaction fees, or that it is more convenient to transfer wealth - these are the icing on the cake. But Krugman seems to think that they are the whole cake.

You need to think about getting a editor - grammar and spelling mistakes hurt the professional image you are trying to convey. 
On your home page, in large type, it says: "Introducton Video". 
Also, in your post, you write, "Can you imagine that other developers could create with these tools?" Wouldn't that be "Can you imagine WHAT other developers could create with these tools?"
And do you really want to say "First port to long time lurker"? Isn't that "First POST to long time lurker"? 
I know some may think I'm being a grammar nazi, but I figure if you don't have attention to detail in your official company announcements and website, perhaps you don't have attention to detail in your coding, either.

It is hard to take seriously an article that puts these two sentences together:


First, the "among aficionados" line is the same as every "experts agree" line in which the author cherry-picks experts who agree with the author's POV. Also, if everyone agrees that Bitcoin's flaws are fatal and unfixable, why are so many "aficionados" pouring millions of dollars into it? It might be true that Bitcoin has some unfixable fatal weakness, but clearly there is no consensus of that fact.
And to make it worse, the author then uses two examples which have nothing to do with any perceived "fatal, unfixable" flaws in Bitcoin. They just show flaws in human nature (which admittedly appear unfixable and fatal) via fraud and incompetence. Does the author really believe that Ripple and/or Stellar will eliminate these flaws from humankind?
Like I said, hard to take the article seriously after that comment.

They are trying to imply that this won't impact the "regular guy", which is BS. Those large institutional investors are the mutual funds, pension accounts, IRAs, etc. which the "regular guy" does have. 
And of course this is just the first step - if it is not profitable to hold large amounts of money, neither is it to hold smaller amounts. This is just all they can get away with right now.
