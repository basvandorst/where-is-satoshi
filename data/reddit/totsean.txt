I tried joining this community,   
[  
But I think it's a full blown scam, it asks me this:  
Your IP address has previously been used for evil on this forum, or it is a known proxy/VPN/Tor exit node, so you are required to pay a small fee before you are able to post messages or send PMs. You can still use all of the read-only features without paying.
Your account contains 1.49 units of evil. To atone, you must pay a total of 0.00000421 bitcoins (0.00421 mBTC; 421 satoshi). Pay to the address 37SqHU6s8aYjUd7mtgdERHReVqYdd6YtE8. Once you have paid the full amount, wait a few seconds and then reload this page. If the fee is so small that your wallet is unable to send it, you can send any larger amount, though you will not be refunded the difference.
Alternatively, any forum staff member and some other notable members can manually whitelist you. Paying the fee is probably easier/quicker, though.
If you don't have any bitcoins, you can get small amounts of free bitcoins using the sites listed [here]( It is recommended that you give the free bitcoin sites the address listed above. Do not collect money in your own wallet and then send the bitcoins to the forum -- this will likely result in significant network fees.
If you find any bugs in this system, email pbbugs-J6X0kjVn For example, send email here if your payment is not registered an hour after sending it. The mere fact that payment is required for your IP address is never a bug. **You will be permanently banned if you send email here requesting free whitelisting.**
People commonly say, "I haven't posted anything before, so why on Earth am I banned?" *You* are not banned. Your *IP address* was previously used for evil, so everyone who uses that IP address has to pay this registration fee.
  
I asked my friend to join and he got the same message and another friend made an account and he got a different amount, even though they're on the same IP. I think it's a scam, they're asking money to whitelist you.   
Anyone know about this?
