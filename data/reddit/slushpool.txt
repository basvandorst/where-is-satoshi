Here as a tweet from our co-CEO explaining the context of Stratum V2 and its brotherly relation to BetterHash:  [ As Matt is saying, we are all "working together towards a common goal" and this is precisely why we are inviting the community to participate in the initiative to upgrade the whole mining stack.

One upvote can go a long way. Anyway, we are in touch with press in order to spread the message and get the community support. So stay tuned and share.

There is still a lot of work to be done to finalize the specs. However, **we have a running prototype for actual testing** what we already have. The spec is pretty complex and having it running helped us to catch few design bugs already. Non-finished spec and running code are not mutually exclusive.

Stratum v2 is a new proposal which is inspired by BetterHash in some aspects. Here as a tweet from our co-CEO explaining the context of Stratum V2 and its brotherly relation to BetterHash: [ As Matt is saying, we are all "working together towards a common goal" and this is precisely why we are inviting the community to participate in the initiative to upgrade the whole mining stack.

The new mining protocol (Stratum V2) is a crucial part of the new mining stack. Yes, there are measures to prevent stealing of hash rate.

The point is the protocol needs to support signing so that miner can be sure it works on a valid work -  it prevents stealing hash rate.  You could basically perform a man in the middle attack and divert hash rate of some miner and mine on your pool, without the miner noticing (hashrate hijacking).

Not all heroes wear capes. Somebody paid actual money to help distinguish this post.


Thank you community!

Please have a look at the website in the title of this post. The section "security, efficiency, **flexibility** and decentralization" explains the main benefits of the new mining stack (including the new protocol) in very simple terms. Using this new stack **miners will be able to pick their own jobs** as well.
Detailed comparison (Stratum V1 vs BetterHash vs Stratum V2) will be released soon.

Yes, we are working hard to make this happen.
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:56:06
Very detailed comparison (Stratum V1 vs BetterHash vs Stratum V2) will be released soon. But in a nutshell the V2 is just better (scalability, efficiency etc.).

Reference implementation of V2 is coming to Braiins OS in December (Litio alpha release). More details regarding the roadmap: [
