I started mining when it was at $28 and going up earlier this year..   I had heard about bitcoins here and there since it started, but did not grab my attention since they were not worth much at all in the beginning..   I seen an article on Reddit about it earlier this year and noticed that merchants were now accepting bitcoins as payment..  I already had a video card that could mine for a profit at $28 so I started mining.  My only intention was to just make enough to buy something cheap like some computer fans or something, just to do it.. I watched as it rose to $266 wondering how high it could go.. I watched a little bit too long and ended up buying some gold when it was at $138 ...  I use bitcoin because its fun to mine and make some coins that can be used to buy things... I would consider this a new hobby of mine that actually makes a little money back..  Its fun to learn also, a very interesting topic that most everyone I talk to has not heard about yet..

That was hilarious!

I agree completely, more exposure on the topic the better..  it is unfortunate it has to be a war though..  But if they see bitcoins as a threat, and act accordingly, then that in a way promotes what bitcoin is to a higher level..

Time to buy is exactly what I was thinking seeing the low price this morning..  Its entertaining to watch the bitcoin market expand with more and more places accepting it..  its only natural that there will some who don't like it..  no matter how good something is change is hard for people.. the idea that this currency CAN make it, and CAN be more than it is today is exciting..  This really is just the beginning..

Very useful for checking on values when I am not home!  
Thanks for the work!

I purchased some gold from Amagi using bitcoins..  took about three weeks total to ship to the US..  Was very easy to order.. I would order from them again..  I looked at ordering from  Coinabul, but reviews stated more delays in receiving their order..

They are and will continue to use the news to smear bitcoin.. and I see this as the beginning not the end..  Think of bad publicity for famous people and stars.. still gets them some fame.. maybe I am being too optimistic..  but I expect them to try and do this..  just like music P2P in the early 2000's ...  more publicity drew more people to use those services.. There will always be some bank allowing currency transfer to bitcoins, even it is not the one you bank at everyday..

I would use a service like this, I have steered away from selling on ebay due to the extra fees, this is appealing.

The seed is planted, just a matter of time now...

Now thats a good cashout!

I see bitcoins leading for 1-2 years before other currencies grow up more..

I am thinking about buying a video card from them this week..  nice to hear a good review and they have quick shipping..

Honestly, I would invest half in some dedicated miners purchased with bitcoins... then try and use bitcoins for any and all purchases for household items, food, etc..

Its hard for a company to recover when you have someone like that representing you.  No matter how many good people there are in the company the customers image is changed forever.

This is very likely...

Just one part of the maturation of bitcoin...
