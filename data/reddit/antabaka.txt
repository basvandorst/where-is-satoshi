... what's wrong with beards and long hair?
As for cheap clothes, I'm not sure what you mean.

母ちゃん doesn't really come across as "Mommy" especially to me without the お, so I would have just used "Mom", but you are right otherwise of course.

In concept 母ちゃん does seem like "Mommy", but （お）母ちゃん is extremely common in Japanese, while Mommy isn't very common in English and shows a lot more affection. That's why I said something.

Reported? Don't waste the mods' time. It isn't against the rules.

What was his stance, if any, on the show? I think that should tell you.
I will say that it is extremely likely that he's not being serious about having **all** of his money in Bitcoin. He would run into so many daily problems with that, that it is simply not worth it (yet, though we are getting there).

However unlikely, a bitcoin competitor could come out of nowhere and steal the market...
Say, one backed by a powerful world government, yet (somehow) as open as bitcoin.
Not that that's likely. I agree with you.

There *are* ways to refer to money in Japanese other than face-value, but they are few and far between, and *very* rarely used.
"Yukichi" is a slang way to refer to a ￥10,000 (~$100) note, in reference to [Yukichi Fukuzawa]( who appears on the note. Same sort of thing as calling a $100 bill a "Benjamin".
But it's rarely used. More rarely than "Benjamin", I would say. You almost always refer to currency as *X-en* (*hyakuen* (￥100), *senen*(￥1000)) in Japanese.

They were logged in at the time. "edit" and the like are visible.

Seeing attractive men has that much of a negative impact on you? Self esteem issues?
@_date: 2014-06-21 22:56:28
Yeah, you've got some prejudice you should work out. I know men who look exactly like the two on the right, and they are some of the hardest working people I know, and they command a lot of respect from their peers.
As for the guy on the left, yeah, he's probably a piece of shit, I can tell because of the way he dresses. /s

...what's sad about this?

Don't get me wrong, I agree with you almost completely, just not with the idea that Adblock is *that* completely widespread, as of yet.

 Buying a drink in an establishment doesn't give you the right to be there, and certainly doesn't give you the right to run a business there. They pay for the spot. They wouldn't be foolish enough to forget to put a clause in the contract barring competition, so the shop would be contractually obligated to stop competition. This is really basic business, and not at all a violation of rights.

"Everyone using adblock" isn't even close to true.
ABP has [~19,000,000 dailly users]( and ~20,000,000 including AB Edge, and Chrome's usage statistics are shit, but it's something like another ~20,000,000 from the various adblock extensions.
So that's about 40,000,000 devices (not people) who *probably* have it set up correctly and are blocking ads on YouTube.
According to [Youtube Statistics]( there are a billion unique viewers each month, which is to say 25 times the number of Firefox and Chrome desktop browsers set up to block YouTube.
Along with that, it says that over 40% of all watch traffic is from mobile devices. While it is possible to block ads on mobile, and it doesn't even require root, I have my doubts that many of those people would know how.
Unfortunately I can't find install statistics for Adaway or ABP for Android, or how many users have enabled unknown sources, so I don't have any hard numbers for that.

It's a private establishment. You have no right to be there. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:10:47
I don't think they were trying to say otherwise.
