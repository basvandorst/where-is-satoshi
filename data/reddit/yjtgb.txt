It's required in order for the alts with utility to actually function. All the moonchildren that joined crypto in the 2017 hype bubble have never seen an altcoin die. They weren't around for Namecoin, Quark or PPC. They are assuming that "cryptos always bounce back" because they have seen bitcoins tumultuous growth cycles and falsely equate that as a property of all cryptos.
Alts won't move up significantly until the userbase is knowledgeable enough to differentialte between cash grabs, alts that have no functional use case, and alts that actually have a chance of surviving because they solve a problem that needs to be solved. It looks like we are still far away from that currently because all the alts still move up and down together, good projects and shitcoins alike.

"Don't re-use address" applies more to spending than receiving. Sending a small amount then a bigger amount to same address is fine.

If you think that 99% of alts are scams/crap projects, you still might invest in the few projects that you believe have actual utility while considering alts as shitcoins generally.

Noobs whole mindset seems to be consumed by the feeling of missing the boat. Although ironically the BTC cruise ship is right there waiting for them to board and instead they are jumping in rusted rowing boats and inflatable dinghies and getting dragged under the waves

The value proposition of crypto has nothing to do with speed. It's monetary policy and the security to safely implement that policy. BCH is a zombie project propped up by people that do not understand the fundamental  reason to even use a blockchain. Not to mention for their particular use case (retail) there will be better alts.
