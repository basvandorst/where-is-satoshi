Flight simulator mode is crazy.
I find it a bit strange that it's staring outside and going inside. That would mean that there is a end to this there the block chain couldn't get any bigger. But I guess this was done so the transaction can travel to the block from the center.

There is absolutely no information about who is running the site. No address and not a single name of anyone who is in charge. 
Also , check the domain! who ever bought it runs a bunch of different scam sites a well.
Never use a side where this is the case.

There will be a massive energy need in the future anyway. Cryto is a way to finance the development needed for this.
Miners are using a large amount of green energy for one simple reason. It's cheap. Solar or wind energy. Might take a large investment at the beginning but after that it's basically free energy and that is what miners want.

It was a great deal. Bitcoin had no value before that so he bought the pizza for $0.00

Why don't they just make a fork called "Bitcoin 2" and claim that it's the newer and better version of Bitcoin?
...oh wait that's exactly what Bitcoin cash did.

There are a tons of apps that are exactly like that on the app store.
I can recommend the "Zelts" apps if you want to get some free BTC/LTC/ETH. The amount You can get is tiny but so is the payout. And getting $0,03 per day in Bitcoin is kinda cool. (Payout works only with Coinbase)

There are several sites where you can buy BTC with gift cards. As long you buy the gift cards with cash it should be pretty anonymously.

I still see it as a security improvent. If someone breaks in my flat I can just take my ledger and instantly transfer my crypto in case they found my recovery seed.
I think that is a way more likely scenario then getting robbed by someone that knows how to exploit a Ledger.

It's also not good for the price. Coinbase might not even have those Bitcoin and will just buy them once you withdraw your BTC.
This is totally normal for fiat in banks.

It would be interesting to have a feature to set a 2nd pin that deletes everything when entered.
So if you get forced to tell the pin you can use the fake one that deletes everything.

Probably not. They won't make the money that they spend on the miners before they are outdated.
@_date: 2018-06-08 10:20:12
I'm not so sure. This is how I calculated it:
Block size: 1,000,000 Byte
Price per Byte: 20 Sat
BTC Price: $8000
Blocks per Day: 144
1,000,000 x 20 x 144 x 8000/100,000,000 = $230,400
@_date: 2018-06-08 09:54:22
Not low fees. Low amounts with a high fee.
So you send 1 sat with a 20sat per byte fee.
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:39:25
100,000,000sat = 1BTC

Offer Bitcoin as payment option if you sell something.

The current Bitcoin network can't be scaled to replace the US Dollar. Even with lightning it couldn't get remotely close to the needed size or speed.
There might be new technology that solves the Scalability problem but the past showed that it's almost impossible to make large changes to the network since most users need to agree on the changes at the same time.
It's more likely that some other crypto replaces the US dollar.
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:24:45
Sure but you can't cancel the transactions you already sent. 
To block all transactions it would be necessary to increase the fee after each block 
Still people could use a really high fee to get it through but even if this blocks only 90% of all transactions it would have a massive impact on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:35:49
This is only the case because everyone is using dollars as the reference point. You could argue that the price of strawberrie's increased by &gt;200% if you convert the price in BTC.
Once BTC is the main reference point for this it won't exist anymore. 
Also bitcoin isn't designed to be used for this type of purchases. At least not in it's current form or do you plan in waiting 1h at the checkout to get your transaction confirmed?
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:25:59
Just start by buying a small amount like $20 or $50. Don't see it as an investment but just a chance to test out things and trying to understand everything.
The very first thing I did with bitcoin was just buying für 40€, selling it a few days later and sending the money back to my bank account.
Sure it was a very bad investment and I lost ~20% of the money but it gave me more confidence that I actually know what I'm doing.

Having an Wallet with Bluetooth and a battery feels wrong to me. 
I know they probably did there best in terms of protection but still. With my Ledger S I know for sure that nothing can access it without energy and a connected cable.

This just makes me feel bad for the American education system. I'm pretty sure the outcome would be different in most European countries.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:37:18
Yes it does make it a bit harder to sell since you need to send the BTC to Coinbase and wait for several confirmations before you can sell them.
There is a fee Everytime you send it. When sending your BTC from the ledger to Coinbase you can use a really low fee like $0.02. it will take several hours to transfer in that case. To get it within the next block you have to pay  $1-2.
You should still keep a portion of your BTC on Coinbase. At least that is how I do it. I see Coinbase as my purse and the hardware wallet more like a savings account.
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:52:03
This cards are just a big scam. You pay an extrem amount of fees while other credit Cards have reward systems that pay you 0.5-2% back of everything you buy.

There is no fixed definition for this but for me "broken" means that you can create a input that matches a certain output without brute Force in a very short time.
So if you want to find an input that creates an Hash with 10 leading zeroes you can just do it and you don't need to create millions till you find one.
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:07:00
That's true for now but a neural network with enough complexity and training should be able to do this.
We see already massive speed improvements in this area and if this continues it's not unlikely to see a network that can do this within the next 10 years.
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:32:54
I don't think that is needed. Something like that won't happen over night. If a way of breaking it is found it will still take many months if not years to do it.
So there is plenty of time to react to the situation. Even something as simple like switching to SHA512 might work in that case.

It should be possible to build a grill that uses the heat of GPUs. But it would be pretty complicated since it needs some way of combining the heat of several cards to get hot enough.

It's a bit strange that they didn't do a video about crypto yet. It seems like the perfect topic for there channel.
You should probably post this in the kurzgesagt subreddit and not here.
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:18:19
That's right but wouldn't that mean that most people make there channels private to prevent abuse and without a reasonable amount of public channels the whole idea of the lightning network won't work?
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:17:04
But I can only spend those 1BTC through Dave's channel if he has other channels open besides the one connecting him to me.
