The fact that I can be playing poker with someone in Japan, Spain, and Mexico all at the same time, withdraw my winnings, and go spend them at the gas station down the street within 10 minutes is pretty cool to me.

Yes, but hopefully instead of asking your friends to pay you back in bitcoin, they will now ask if they can just repay you on Circle.
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:41:14
Yea, I believe Circle.com is your best bet.

People need to understand that Shift is not suppose to be just a "bitcoin debit card". It is a debit card that allows you to connect multiple accounts to it, and switch between them instantly before making a purchase. I currently use both Coinbase and Dwolla on it, and it has worked flawlessly so far. You are not spending bitcoin, you are selling it and until merchants accept bitcoin themselves, this is the best way we have to spend it everywhere. Im looking forward to Shift adding more account options to the card such as giftcards, airline points, bank accounts, etc...

I just love how ghash inches close to 51% and suddenly everyone that mines at cex and ghash is the enemy and evil! 
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:13:43
Again, im only doing this to play around with it. I might find myself losing out in the end. This is also not a long term investment for me. I realize the price will decline as the difficulty goes up, but you would think as the price of bitcoin falls (which I think will happen over the next few weeks, maybe for only a short period) the price of GHS will go up to keep the USD value per GHS the same (roughly).
@_date: 2014-09-06 22:34:31
I had the same issue once trying to use up the rest of one of my cards. I tried to pull it up in line, the barcode wouldn't load and they tried to type in the numbers but it wouldn't work either. The girl even had one of her managers try to help. Nothing would work and they actually discounted my total $5 and apologized. I was in Colorado in a really really spotty reception area. I think its an issue of not being connected. Fortunately there was no one in line behind me. I like the idea of screenshoting barcodes though, Ill have to try that.
@_date: 2014-06-14 20:15:24
Its 3% off the purchase price and an additional 3% in points for future purchases. Just spent $130 at Sears and $40 on Amazon for fathers day. It was my first time using their service and it went absolutely perfect! Luckily the price dropped by the time I replenished my BTC stash too :)

Thanks for this. Im a hands on type of learner, lol. Ive only put 2btc into CEX.io so im not too worried about losing out on much. Ill just have to make sure I get out before the big dump :). Thanks for your input though,  nice to get honest feed back from someone that doesnt just go "OMGZ uR SO DUBmZ! CEX IS ATCCKING BITCOINZ AND uR ALL STUpid!!!!11!!1!"

Couldn't a small business just check the transaction right after its broadcasted and see if there is a fee attached to the transaction? If there is one they it would be "an acceptable risk" but if they saw there was no fee attached they could request the customer to try again?

I actually just switched to breadwallet last night too, blockchain.info is constantly glitching, freezing, crashing. I have a coinbase app too (for buying, not storing my coins) and even their app is constantly glitching. Hopefully breadwallet is better.

There's a magical oracle that knows when everyone is about to buy, then the magical oracle sells all of his BTC &gt; ??? &gt; then profits. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:39:32
Well, while instead of my bitcoins sitting in a wallet doing nothing, they are mining, its only profitable as long as I can sell my shares for the same or more then what I paid for them. I feel like there is a current uptrend on cex.io so I bought in. Its a gamble in the end.
edit - just adding that this is simply a way for me to play around and diversify my investments. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 17:44:40
I turned 5 BTC into 7 BTC...then back to 4 BTC, now at 6 BTC... its a hell of a rollercoaster.
@_date: 2014-06-23 22:00:09
Everyone that thinks its ok for the Gov to do this is wrong. How the hell do they know how much this guy made? What if he had bought in higher then he sold and wanted to cut his loses? Why should he be taxed on his loses? 
Its one thing to avoid paying your taxes, its another for the Government to just be like "dur dur dur, we're just going to take 22% of every bitcoin withdraw you make"
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:21:10
Breadwallet is good, though lately ive been having to press the "sync with blockchain" a lot.
@_date: 2014-06-14 02:31:40
Just an FYI, I pulled out all my shares at CEX.IO today. I invested 3x the bitcoins I had invested at CEX.IO into Petahash which is working on aiming its hashing power towards p2pool (about 2% of the network). 
edit - to everyone telling me I was the enemy.

Hmm, I too use Alliant Energy, would be awesome if this was possible. Where are you from?
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:03:59
Unless the fees are less then 5%, I don't see any more reason to use this then to use BTC-e's debit card withdraw. I suppose that takes 2-3 days, so if this is to be instant I could see it being very useful. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 13:47:21
Of Course! But is it for medical only?

I asked my pooper scooper people if they would consider it, she didnt know what it was at all and had never heard of it. She does us intuit or for my bill. Since then, intuit announced their paybycoin service. Maybe she will see that some day and consider it. Not getting my hopes up though....
@_date: 2014-05-28 22:25:48
I figured it probably would. If I see something I want that I cant find around here ill be sure to give you my business! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-10 14:14:47
Use a local Credit Union. They are the best and never ask any questions. Ive done over $15,000 in BTC deposits to my Coinbase account and a few thousand in withdraws. Never been asked a single question or sent any letters in almost a year.
@_date: 2014-08-19 03:09:02
Thank fucking god for BTC-e, right? I mean seriously. People always have shit to talk about BTC-e being the next exchange to run with the money, get hacked, or get shut down but, they have given me better service and the highest level of comfort out of any other exchange out there. BTC-e will have my business till the day it is no longer.
@_date: 2014-08-17 16:24:09
I understand this, but Im sure when your store started accepting bitcoin, you informed your employees "Hey, we accept bitcoin. So if someone comes in and asks about it, send them my way." Now, Im also sure you aren't an extremely large corp like Dish Network with thousands of employees. Either way, just saying, they've had months since the announcment to prep their employees for the rush of new customers/bitcoin customers.

This exact same thing happened to me as well. I was able to call UPS and give them the address I shipped to along with the approx date i shipped it and they were able to give me a tracking number. Took a hell of a lot of work and me sitting on the phone with ebay and ups forever. Worked out in the end though.

This happened to me at the only place that "accepts" bitcoin around me. I went to a small tapas place with a buddy about 30 min from home. I was excited to actually find a place that accepts btc. We got there, saw a big "WE ACCEPT BITCOIN" sign in the window and everything. After we ordered a few beers I said to the bartender "So, I can pay for this beer with bitcoin...right?" and he responded "uuuhhhh no... Im sorry but the guy that did all the bitcoin transactions doesnt work here anymore and we dont know how to do it." . I didnt put up a fuss about it though.

I wonder how Grooveshark doesn't get in trouble for not paying for any their music? Wouldn't this type of business technically be illegal?
@_date: 2014-11-29 00:32:20
Probably because they are a small US company that is hodling all of their bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:08:38
To be honest, I discovered bitcoin early 2013 after reading about the silkroad before it was oh so popular. I couldnt help but be fasinated by the fact that drug dealers found a way to transfer money electroniclly that couldnt be stopped. So I figured it the money is real enough for a very large drug dealer... then its real enough for me. Then I read more and more about it and all sorts of lightbulbs clicked, then realized there is way more to this then drugs.... its da future!
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:46:28
I would be wary of coinapult, I lost a over half bitcoin (due to my own dumbass self playing satoshi dice with a webwallet) and they would not send me any of my coin back even after providing undeniable proof of what happened. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:15:12
Could it possibly be an announcement of a US based exchange opening? Possibly Buttercoin.com? I just recently heard about buttercoin but if you look at the bottom of the page the "Backers" include Google Ventures, Reddit, and Combinator...anyone else know more about buttercoin that could fill me in maybe?
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:52:14
Namecoin? It wouldnt be .com or .org but you can get a .bit domain.
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:52:58
 Im simply playing around with cloud mining and currently profiting from it, not much but none the less making a profit. Trust me, I have plenty of bitcoins held in cold storage, and not ready jump head first into the mining world. As much as I would love to start setting up my own mining hardware, I dont know enough about it to be sure to turn a profit. Gotta start somewhere.....
@_date: 2014-08-16 20:47:47
I didnt give him a hard time by any means. You would just think that a company would prepare their employees for questions regarding bitcoin. I realize its new to them and this stuff takes time, but they've had a few months since the announcement to educate their staff enough to say 
"Yes, you can pay with bitcoin"
@_date: 2014-06-22 18:44:31
Wouldn't higher variance = less blocks found (short term)? In turn less dividends?

@_date: 2014-06-12 21:13:48
Considering im in this for the long haul, im not worried about the price going down at the moment, in fact Im happy that it is going down, it provides me with another opportunity to buy in more. I dont think that this massive dip is because people fear ghash, I personally think it is due to the amount of adoption and the fact that these companies are converting their BTC to fiat. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 22:20:48
Block reward dropping = bitcoin price rising. :)

You realize currencies are traded on a market all the time right. Ever heard of Forex?
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:36:51
I just started using CEX.IO recently actually. I like the idea that if I can get in while the market price is low, I can profit not only from mining, but from selling my shares at a higher price. Im not so worried about Ghash executing a 51% attack, but would be open to trying other services that are similar. What do you suggest for a cloud mining alternative that provides sufficient liquidity and has a low maintenance cost?

One time, on r/skydiving, someone posted about their 300th jump or something....i made my own moniker for "pack" being $6 worth of btc and said "Hey, congrats on your 300th jump, have a free pack on me!" and tipped the gentlemen $6. He responded with "thank you" and it was all I ever heard. The tip was collected but, I still dont know what he ever did with that $6.....I can only hope he paid his good packer at the dropzone $6 in BTC to pack his parachute for him......
