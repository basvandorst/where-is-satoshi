Oh ye of little HODL
I'm one to talk, I sold my first bitcoin at $700 after buying in at $400.

Silk Road don't help without an address, or am I missing something about being homeless?
I guess they could open a P.O box, right?

Sometimes, you think you trust them entirely when you get married. And then that trust gets broken down over time.
I'm not married, but I've seen lots of married people with trust issues.

I bought at 375, saw it drop to 190, saw it rise to 800 and took my out. That was in November 2016, right before the huge surge

I meant to invest right when it dropped. Now it's back up and I missed my chance
