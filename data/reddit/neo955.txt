They don’t have to dump it from 14 to 9, they just have to get the ball rolling and let the weak hands flush out.  Manipulation happens all the time.  I’m not saying it was solely responsible, but I believe it at least played a role.

If you’ve come here for a prediction of price, my recommendation is to not listen to any of the 1000s of “explanations” or “predictions” here.  
Nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow or next year.  Anyone that tells you they do know is either stupid or lying (or both).  
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:11:28
Funny, because that’s when the announcement a deal wouldn’t be made.  
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:02:21
I was being a bit dramatic.  And I don’t entirely disagree.  What I mean is that when there is truly political uncertainty, people purchase BTC for other reasons that they normally do.  
And I think if major governments did botch our systems, the “value” would skyrocket.  
It’s seen as the new gold...  Buy it because if this shit all falls apart you’ll need something to trade.  So in that sense, just as gold, the value can be used to determine fiat uncertainty (or political mechanisms that regulate it)...

The spike was exactly at midnight.  There was money sitting and waiting to buy in at midnight.  It may be a speculative attempt to grab some cash, but it is most definitely connected to the shutdown.  
The value of BTC is just the worlds bet against governments.  It’s absolutely connected to the state of centralized systems around the world.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:01:00
Am I the only one that thinks a massive pump is coming?  
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:12:07
Volume seems to be a trusty predictor of price fluctuations with BTC and other coins.  Does someone here that understands how this correlation works mind sharing their knowledge?  
What source do you use and what do you look for with volume fluctuations?  
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:30:17
Some people are holding not for the dollar value they can get back out..  They have bet against the traditional financial system.  If the system does fail and BTC takes the role of a trusted world currency, HODLers will be among the richest people in the world.  
I think most people know that’s a long shot, but it isn’t impossible.

@_date: 2018-01-20 13:27:04
You notice the price of BTC spiked up $1000 as soon as midnight struck and the government shut down?  The value of BTC is a numerical representation of our concern with governments and their ability to regulate fiat currency.  It’s the fucking doomsday clock.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:00:55
The price shot up immediately after the contracts expired.  That’s a hell of a coincidence if there is no connection.

There are people that make a lot of money investing in various fiat currencies.  If you’d have used dollars to buy Euros when they were first minted back in 2003, you could have doubled your dollar value in about a year.  
I’m not sure what you are asking.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:46:46
I agree completely.  Thanks for taking my (and others) comments into consideration.  You guys do a good job here.  This sub is (in my opinion) the only place to get a finger on the pulse of the tech AND the market fluctuations.  ����
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:57:44
People are afraid to buy the dip, because they don’t k ow where the bottom is.  We need a whale to buy a couple 1000 BTC to get out of this rut.

Futures means there are people that will win if the price drops.  That isn’t a good thing. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:59:57
Not with futures contracts.  That’s the difference in futures.  You can lose just based on where the price is at the end of the contract. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:50:43
I’m just looking at the moment the spike happened.  I don’t believe in coincidences that strong.  Maybe it was manipulation or speculation.  But I can’t believe that the timing is just random. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:20:18
[FUD trolls]( are having a field day.  That’s okay, they will take a back seat again when this downward trend is reversed.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:45:52
That does make sense.  The thing that throws me off is the times I’ve heard people say “uh oh, low volume right now”...  and then the price drops after they predict it.  I just don’t understand why that’s bad really.  If I’m holding and your not buying it just seems stable.  
I am understanding now though that you need buyers to be stable.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:40:15
If you were waiting for a time to buy in, I’d say it’s now.  
Oh, and fuck futures...
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:36:27
So you’re saying that low volume means low interest in buying at the current price?  Thanks makes sense.  I understand much of this stuff but this needs to be explained to me as if I’m a 5 year old. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:30:46
So why is low volume bad?  If people are just holding that would indicate stability wouldn’t it?
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:37:46
Is there a good overall chart that shows volume alongside the price and trends and what-not?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:12:39
Fear of that is what’s driving the price down.  So I’d say down.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:03:33

You are reading stuff in my comments that I didn’t say.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:19:56
How many of you are waiting for a certain number to buy right now?  I’m guessing a lot.  Whatever the average is of those numbers is where this downtrend will stop (I’m hoping 10k).  Once we are moving back up everyone that is shorting will jump back in.  This is my prediction at least.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:12:32
Agreed.  I am hoping this lightning network will fix some of the issues facing BTC.  
My primary concern is the fight crypto currencies in general will face against the status quo and large financial institutions it threatens.  We are talking about the most powerful individuals and organizations on the planet.  
If BTC or crypto in general can overcome that I believe there will be no stopping mass adoption.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:08:33
Good point. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:47:28
I totally agree with you.  But I think the bear market doesn’t start because of traders trying to capitalize. That happens after the first few dominos fall.  
The first few dominos is what I’m talking about.  Like people see that news and are like “oh godddd, BTC is about to be worthless and I’m getting out now.”  
These people must have their coins on an exchange ready to be sold at any second.  This is what I don’t get.   I understand the trading aspect, of you have the balls and a little luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:48:09
I didn’t say Bitcoin is the solution.  You are reading stuff that’s not there. Be disgusted if it makes you feel better. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:10:47
I’ve been around a while now.  I’ve seen the market do this before: alts and BTC bleed for a couple days TOGETHER.  
What’s everyone’s thoughts on this phenomenon?  Does the fear just spread to every coin?  Is it manipulation?  I would expect if it was just fear of BTC issues the alts would be getting pumped right now, but that’s not the case..
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:23:21
I agree it’s a bubble.  But it’s only a bubble because people believe it is.  It becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.  “Oh damn the price is about to drop I better sell my coins” and then the price drops.  
Sure, some smart (and lucky) people can exploit this and make money on the vacuum and subsequent pump.  But it’s mostly just weak hands running, and either forfeiting inevitable profit or flat out taking a loss.  Just makes no sense to me personally.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:29:19
And then that BTC will be distributed to thousands of “little people”....  at which point we have more people involved in crypto with more skin in the game (the opposite of what you’re suggesting).  
The “individuals” holding those wallets are probably investment firms, exchanges, or early miners that lost access to their wallet years ago.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:45:58
I’ll never understand why people run to sell their BTC when some vague news like this hits...  Do people really think this will kill BTC?  We can damn near be certain the price will come back stronger and we will hit an ATH in the next month or so.  If the past is an indicator of the future, this will not kill BTC (its survived way worse FUD)....  So who the hell is dumping their BTC?  
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:59:14
More likely it consolidates around 16.5k.  I wouldn’t expect a new ATH until January.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:49:42
I’d say Coinbase is at least partially to blame.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:01:23
I’m not betting on BCH to fail.  Just for BTC to recover fast and pick up large gains in the next days.  I also bought some alts with it.  I am diversified, just heavy on the BTC.  
As far as BCH.  I don’t have faith in it.  I think their attack on BTC says something about their ability to stand on merit alone. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:43:34
That same $200B will come back into the market when the dust settles, me thinks. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:41:48
It’s just newbs and people that want BTC to fail because all their $ is in altcoins.  Just background noise.  Tune it out and keep riding that shuttle.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:47:30
When the BCH fork took place I had just gotten into Crypto and was learning the ropes.  I didn’t even know that we’d receive BCH in the same amount.  When I finally figured it out, I realized that I had 1.4 BTC in Coinbase at the time of the fork (it was only there for one day so this is sort of luck). Then discovered that Coinbase was not going to release the BCH until Jan 1st.  
Fast forward to now.  I’m actually glad they did hold it, otherwise I’d have dumped it on day 1.  I’m pretty disgusted with their overt market manipulation and attack on BTC.  
Anyway, I got rid of that 1.4 BCH as soon as I was able to.  It’s mostly in BTC, where it belongs.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:20:00
Anything is possible.  I guess only time will tell.

@_date: 2017-12-26 16:52:24
I second this comment.  The people above saying they made BTC doing this was just lucky.  They do it enough and they will lose.  And you don’t hear those that lost BTC bragging about it.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:16:52
Yeah I agree with you.  I think Coinbase and BCH attempt to kill BTC got the ball rolling.  But the FUD is built into the system almost and I’m not sure how to eradicate it. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:03:25
This is a good point.  I’m familiar with game theory.  And I think you’re absolutely right.  It probably is just people trying to capitalize.  The “weak hands” thinking the sky is falling just makes no sense, and that’s why I commented.  
Thanks for not being one of the “why not sell BTC, it’s doomed to fail” types.  Lol
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:18:13
That’s why I said “or so” at the end of the statement.  It’s not a price prediction.  The point of my comment is this sort of FUD has not killed BTC even though it’s been tested a thousand times.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:19:09
I just told everyone to buy in now, since they were saying they already missed the boat.  Now when it goes back to 19k I’ll be able to revisit it and see if they listened to me.

The current fiat and banking system is what I fear cannot sustain forever.  It is also being driven by fear greed and delusion.

I was only asking why you’d waste your time if you think Bitcoin is a big waste of time?  Your response was “wtf seriously?”  Don’t act like you aren’t purposely instigating people.  That’s the definition of trolling.  I’m using that in reference to you as a verb, so you no longer need to try and flag a moderator.  You are “trolling” this thread.  
It would be akin to going to a Lebron James thread and just spend hours talking about how bad he sucks.  Then when someone calls you out on it you’re just like “well that’s just my opinion, that’s what this thread is about”...   
It’s obvious.  And I’m entitled to my opinion just as much as you are.  So don’t keep saying you have a right to your opinion while in the same breath saying that those of us who disagree with you should just shut up and move on.  
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:06:15
“So don’t keep saying you have a right to your opinion while in the same breath saying that those of us who disagree with you should just shut up and move on.”
That’s what I said.  I was not telling you to shut up.  
And I don’t care about Labron either.  I just mentioned him to illustrate someone going to a fan thread to tell everyone he sucks.  People that believe he is the GOAT will take personal offense, much like calling people names.  
At any rate, you and I will not agree.  But yeah, we can move on peacefully.  
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:46:28
You have hundreds of comments that aren’t “bearish,” they are downright “the sky is falling”...  you are entitled to your opinion, my question is why spend hours online just saying BTC is doomed?  
You obviously don’t know.  But you claim to know.  That’s just as absurd as saying “we go moon tomorrow” every hour every day.  At least that guy has a reason, he wants to drive the price up.  
So I can only assume you want to drive the price down, or you just have no life (or both).  Either way, yes: you are a troll.  
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:37:56
If I believed it was dying and had no plans to enter the space, I wouldn’t waste my time trolling people about it.  Why spend your time like that?  
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:58:47
It’s just my opinion that you’re a troll, I’m just bearish on you as a person.  Do you not get that?  I never said I was an expert on you being a troll.  
You can agree or disagree, and then move on with your life.  
See how that works?
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:31:50
I didn’t say shut up.  And I revised my statement about you to what you are doing.  That’s what I meant by the word verb.  My apologies for calling you a troll.  But you are trolling.  I’m not name calling, I’m describing what I see.  
Even if Lebron got worse as a player, spending hours online in a thread about him: saying he sucks would be trolling (by definition).

How do we handle the BCash we got for free in 2017?  I sold mine and bought BTC and some altcoins.  Bitcoin.taxes rolled it into my overall earnings and counted it as 100% capitol gains.  Is that correct, as the IRS has not specified how to handle an event like a crypto fork?
