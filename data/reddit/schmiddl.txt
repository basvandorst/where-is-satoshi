These Bitcoin churches are as awe inspiring as ever. I remember when people argued that Bitcoin is a fad, because "it is not real, you can't touch it". I used to show them pictures of large mining farmes to get them to understand the scale and power behind Bitcoin. Many times this flipped a switch in them.

This is just the beginning. PoW mining will improve clean energy tech in the same way it gave us the biggest supercomputer on earth in just ten years. Soon we will reach physical limits in ASIC chip design. To stay profitable in the mining race, miners will need to keep improving their energy sources. In the process they will start building their own ever more efficient clean energy tech. Advancing clean energy will lead to huge benefits for the whole world.

If you earn interest with your cryptocoins in Germany, the holding period after which you may sell the coins taxfree increases from 1 to 10 years. This is a long time in crypto I think! So as soon as you stake your coins in a PoS coin or earn interest in any other way, such as the LedgerX savings account, your coins value gets reduced by your tax rate. Not attractive for me, sorry.

u/dan_from_san_diego thank you for sharing your insights! It is so great to see that there are still „small“ miners out there and that mining seems to be profitable for them and not only for the really big players. This gives me hope for a decentralized Bitcoin. Nice to have miners come forward that people can relate to.

Cash is also being printed out of thin air by the Federal Reserve to cover deficit spending etc. Every dollar in existence is debt.

Maybe they should switch to number of transaction outputs.

wow, 35 cents is nothing compared to the credit card fee circle has. thanks for the tip!

Look out privacy alts. BTC will eat your lunch in a couple of years :)
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:31:30
If you look at it, there is really no difference, because of the centralized nature of circle. I would not want to hold my bitcoin savings in the circle wallet anyway. 
Circle is faster than bank transfers and can be cheaper than PayPal. It is bitcoin stripped from its ideological underlining. so I don't have a problem with your statement above. Circle should be fiat on bitcoin steroids.
Then it would have the chance to work as a payment provider for the mainstream. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:37:45
Thanks for pointing that out! I wasn't aware that there is a difference. I think my bank only offers visa credit cards, but I will check with them tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:47:02
Decentralized exchanges are nice, but multi-sig addresses will make centralized exchanges saver as well.. at least for your bitcoin holdings. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 14:23:24
Well, I like that Bitcoin transfers are instant. That said, circle comes close to a traditional bank in that it is centralized. So why not profit from bitcoins fast transaction speed and the predictability of the euro / dollar?
I mean this in a context of a spending wallet like circle!! 
Not for my bitcoin savings, they are stored away in Armory. I would NEVER EVER want to tie the later to anything!!!

My comment on inflationary coins was meant as an observation not as an endorsement. Bitcoin's hard cap is the single most important factor in successfully bootstrapping it in my opinion. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:07:33
Great, so I'm not the only one.
@_date: 2014-09-30 12:58:39
I can send money almost instantly to the kraken exchange with my Fidor bank account. And it does not cost anything (european bank transfers are free)! 
I know that this is not an option for mainstream users and this is why circle needs it.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:47:26
"Using more Recovery seeds as one multisig wallet eliminates that problem, because you don't ever need to put all shares together at one location..."
I don't get it. Are you saying that with TREZOR I can create a multisig wallet with 3 seeds for example? And with 2 of 3 I'd be able to reconstruct the wallet?
@_date: 2014-12-04 16:02:14
still can't link a german bank account to circle and credit card fees are too expensive. 
kraken and a fidor bank account is fast and cheap.
@_date: 2018-08-25 07:55:04
Ask yourself this: If someone tried to fork BTC to remove the 21 million limit, would you hodl the fork with inflation or the one with a hard cap? It is simply irrational to invest in an inflationary coin, when there is a truly scarce, hard capped coin available. It is theoretically possible to remove the limit, but the incentives point in the other direction.
There might be a chance to succeed for the inflationary coin, if they manage to capture the best devs from the hard capped fork. Then again the inflation would have to be set very low for people to invest their money.
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:19:13
storj.io is another one.
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:04:04
Agreed, for payments where one would expect censorship I would use another wallet.
Circle's competitors are not only other crypto currency payment providers, but services like Paypal etc. Wouldn't you think it is weird, if your Paypal balance would change constantly?
At least I think this would freak mainstream users out.
And if you look at circle purely as a spending wallet for small amounts of money, then it would be nice to not be exposed to bitcoin's volatility I think. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 10:05:58
great! and from a designer's view point they fit your style much better.
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:46:26
:) what I mean is that circle could separate bitcoin the stock from bitcoin the currency. isn't that a good thing for people that don't want to be exposed to the risk of price fluctuations? 
This way people new to bitcoin get to experience how fast and cheap it is with the price stability that they are used to. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:08:42
with fidor to kraken about 30 minutes.

His book "Physics of the Future" is based only on technology that is being developed right now in laboratories around the world. He has borrowed this approach to predict the future of technology / society from Jules Verne's book "Paris in the Twentieth Century".
In 1860 he made some remarkably accurate predictions of the world in 1960 by visiting leading scientists and inventors of his time and looking at what they were working on.
Here is a wikipedia link:

The price tends to level itself after a sudden rise up in value. After a large spike confidence breaks down when the price falls as fast as it rose. When the bottom got hit, people need some time to regain confidence. Right now we are in that phase. The price is holding its level, but people don't really trust this stability yet. If this level can hold up and even keeps on rising in small increments, it only needs a week of really good news to make it go up exponentially.. then we start all over again.

I think you got me wrong! I can't imagine what it feels like to loose all your money and maybe hope invested in Bitcoin! All I'm saying is that if MTGox will be restarted with a fractional reserve policy it has a very high possibility to burn even more people over the next years.
Even if the restart is the only way for people to get their money / bitcoins back, the expense is high! Gox.com could only survive if new funds will be deposited on a regular basis. These new funds are likely to come from Bitcoin newbies not familiar with MTGox's history. They will be drawn in by lower prices and fees compared to other exchanges. So people won't get their own money or coins back, they would receive the savings of other people. This might lead to a spiral that could turn out badly for everyone in the long run.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:59:42
Multi-sig will arrive in all the major wallets and exchanges this year I hope. Bitcoin thefts will become a lot more unlikely just by this one feature. And you won't need charge-backs, because with multi-sig we'll have escrow.
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:20:49
Sure, I'd want my money back, but not at the expense of other people! Of course that is easy to say for someone who didn't loose money to gox. So maybe take my opinion as an outsider's perspective.
You have to be aware that you would not get YOUR money or coins back, but the money of new gox.com users. Someone will get burned in a ponzi scheme: the new users. 
And one of the biggest arguments for the Bitcoin protocol is that it operates on full reserve. I feel like it betrays all the newbies who read about Bitcoin's advantages compared to the fractional reserve banking system and then put their savings into gox.com, just so someone else can get their money out.
@_date: 2014-09-30 12:57:07
Great, looking forward to it!
@_date: 2014-10-03 09:02:12
great! very simple and reduced. the only thing that looks very cheap is the green button, because of the beveled edges and the drop shadow. looks like 90's photoshop graphics. 
you could also remove the thin line above the Euro / Bitcoin buttons to gain more space. makes it look cleaner and does not deflect the eye from the important parts of the website.
the rest of the design emanates trust and feels like a bank. 
is there a release date for the service? or is there a way to stay up to date?
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:03:08
I have been owning bitcoins for two years now, so I am used to volatility ;). Circle promised to add something new. While they have done so in terms of user experience, they could go further! That is all I said.
I like the volatility for speculation purposes, but it would be nice to add 7 euros to my circle account and buy a pizza three days later for 7 euros wouldn't it?
@_date: 2015-05-19 21:03:34

People / the media will always generate reasons after sudden rises and falls. You will never know the true causes. I think there are no reasons beside market structure: There was a huge rise in prices over the last couple of years and now the price will consolidate around the starting price of the rally.  People are afraid to buy right now, so the sellers can sell and push the price further down. This selling pressure will continue until we reach a level, where the big players will feel confident of entering the market again. Selling pressure is kind of interesting, because as a big player you can try to push prices through certain important support levels and by that make other people panic sell. This will continue the bear market and you may buy back at lower prices later..

The Ledger Vault is a way to split your master seed into pieces across multiple ledger devices. You can choose how many devices need to sign a transaction for it to become valid. But I guess it has way more features than a simple Multi-Sig wallet. is targeting institutional funds with the Vault, but I think it is also great for private hodlers.
@_date: 2018-07-10 15:19:15

$I find the biological dimension of Bitcoin the most fascinating new way of thinking about it: Bitcoin is a digital organism that pays us to keep it alive.
The article argues that for now each blockchain organism should specialize in one area and aim for symbiotic relationships with other blockchains. Examples are layer 2 solutions such as Lightning on top of Bitcoin or ERC-20 tokens ontop of Ethereum. 
There seems to be a lot of room for complex symbiotic relationships in the blockchain organism(s) when looking at our own bodies as examples for how many bacteria perform important functions inside an organism. 
So are we now at the complexitiy level of individual bacteria? What will the blockchain organism(s) look like when we reach the complexity of an ant or a mouse, a cat, dog etc.?
Not sure if I agree with the statement that forking is equal to the ultimate goal of reproduction in nature. Does an immortal organism have to reproduce itself? Maybe as a security guard against massive network failures or being overtaken by malicious actors. Our death is certain, so from a purely evolutionary point of view we gain more from having children than a blockchain organism. The latter can try to become more secure by adding hash power, increase the numbers of devs, users, merchants, use cases, etc. and thus live forever and only fork in absolute emergency situations. Forks are competitors, so maybe not as beneficial as our children for us.

In Germany the holding period, after which you can sell your coins tax free, increases from 1 to 10 years when you stake your coins / earn rewards with them. So I'm not sure if I'd be willing to earn routing fees. Perhaps with just a small amount of coins.

I issued a SEPA withdrawal for 6000 Euro in the end of October from MtGox and it arrived 21 days later. You have to have a "trusted" account to withdraw more than 1000 Euro at once and each customer can only make one SEPA withdrawal every 20 days.
This is what their support site says about SEPA withdrawals:
- It is not possible to withdraw less than 10 EUR.
- Withdraws lower than 100.00 EUR are on average take less than a week.
- It takes at least a month on average for withdrawals larger than 10,000 EUR
- Withdrawals greater than 50,000 EUR need to be split it into multiple transfers or you can use the International Wire payment method
- Due to the volume of withdrawals requests, each customer is currently only allowed 1 withdrawal every 20 days (estimate)
 Situation as of 10th December 2013: We are currently processing withdrawals requested 3 weeks. (Users with several withdrawals in the queue must take the 20 day rule above into account)
I also wrote their support and received a helpful answer just a couple of hours later. My withdrawals were split into 6 x 1000 Euro, which would take up to 4 months to process, given that each customer can only issue one withdrawal every 20 days. They cancelled them for me and after getting a "trusted" account I withdrew everything at once. 
But since then I haven't been trading at MtGox. Their withdrawal queue is just not acceptable!
