Isn't something wrong with the volume on the graph? It should be way higher back in December than what it currently is.

I'm not worried at all I just saw this article and thought I'd share it. Also just because the US emits half a trillion tons of CO2 per year doesn't mean it's fine or good that bitcoin, if true, emits this much CO2.
No one here is against bitcoin and striving for clean energy in everything including bitcoin is a good thing.
Edit: per year not day

Yeah i actually had that article in mind. But both could be true because emission of CO2 is probably just calculated using the power consumption of bitcoin mining without taking into account where that power is coming from (renewable energy).
Could be wrong though

Didn't read the whole paper but I took notice on this. 
"Thirdly, we calculate the carbon footprint, based on the regional carbon intensity of power generation."
So it seems they calculated the CO2 emission using a mean value for CO2 emission per unit of power usage which doesn't clarify whether is energy used is clean energy or excess clean energy that would otherwise go to waste etc. But obviously knowing that most of the energy comes from China I wouldn't expect to much of it being clean energy or excess energy.
Though this could be wrong taking into account the article posted here a couple days ago saying ~70% of the energy used by miners were clean.

You could go directly to the source if you think the article is shit.

Would make good sense. Also the article is probably aiming to fud bitcoin. But seeing as this is a major news outlet the free advertisement is good for bitcoin.

It doesn't matter if they have a lot of hydro. Ideally we would want bitcoin mining (and other energy consumptions) be based on excess energy that can't be stored and this is what I doubt is the case. 
Even in EU it's very common that a lot of energy is wasted because it can't be stored in a feasible way. 
Would love to hear what you learn from the article though.

lmao im dyiiin hope they keep making crypto vids now. I hate that they kinda quit the workout shit and focused more on comedy! Hope they go full time into crypto

Yep just looked through all their channels they barely go above 100k views any more. I guess the comedy thing is good enough for them
