Not much,  I mean I was always techy and fixing the computer and stuff, but literally Hello World was the extent of my programming abilities. If you are holding any crypto you are in as good if not better of a place then I was.
I actually went into college as "undecided" within the school of engineering and went into Electrical Engineering. But had to take CS101 in order to get the EE degree and while I liked EE, I knew I couldn't do it for a job. Still ended up graduating with the EE degree but was only 2 classes short of a CS degree and marketed myself that way. But in the end it was perfect, because while I'm coding all day, I have to deal with printer driver code, a lot of raw bytes, and talking to hardware via RS232 and a bunch of stuff that I wouldn't have known had I not done the EE stuff.  If you have any other questions feel free to ask.

lol I don't actually think it's going to happen, I really really really hope he doesn't eat his own balls, not just because I don't want to see it, but because that would be monumentally stupid. But what I *do* want to see happen is the post calling him out, that would be hilarious
