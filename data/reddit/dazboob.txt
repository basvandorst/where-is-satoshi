No not from mining BCH from buying it - sorry should have clarified.

Disclaimer, I don't know for certain - very few people know for certain why this is actually happening. But from what I've gathered in my own research it makes sense they would accumulate BCH at 300 once it is nice and cheap, and knowing when they switch to BCH as it becomes more profitable to mine(along with the timing of the cancelled Segwit2x fork) all the hash power leaves Bitcoin to go to BCH and causes panic within the Bitcoin community. I would expect they had pretty clear indications they would be able to severely manipulate the market and cause people to go to BCH therefore pumping the price.
Edit: grammar

I agree bitcoin has some kinks to work out. But why they are idiots, and in my opinion just feeding big players that manipulated them and the rest of the market is that a lot of small time investors like you or I (in the grand scheme of things) did not want to buy BCH at 300. Instead tons of people fomo'd in at 1400+. You have to be idiotic to think that makes sense that you invest in something that is more than 4x what it was 5 days ago without real facts leading this whole thing.
The fact of the matter is because nobody knew what was going on, investing in BCH at 1400 truly is idiotic. Yes, I probably am being mean - but this is a cutthroat market and decisions like that are so unbelievably rampant in this community it's insane. 
Then you get people all over reddit and the internet complaining that right when they bought BCH at 2300 it crashed. For me it's like "What the hell were you thinking???". That shit was 300 dollars 5 days ago - nobody is going to feel bad for you.

Well I'd say the part where they were accumulating BCH at around the 300 dollar level and then knowingly switching to it when it became more profitable allowed them to take advantage of a large number of people that put their money into BCH not understanding why they were.

Sure, I agree in regards to people who actually believe in BCH. But I'm mostly talking about the FOMO'ers who figured they'd make a quick buck by jumping on to the hype train and who are now down substantial amounts.

I don't blame them. I think it was a smart play. I just don't feel bad for any idiots that are losing money on BCH. I am frusterated that this potentially will make big miners even bigger thus increasing centralization - but I certainly don't blame them or anyone for making money.
