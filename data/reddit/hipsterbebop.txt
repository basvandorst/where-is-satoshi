It's a decent talk, I find Tucker to be an interesting guy, and I like the unbreakable glass analogy at the end. But this isn't a great introductory video to Bitcoin.

Post proof or it didn't happen.
Speaking as a BTC holder, seriously, just quit saying this unless you bought. Otherwise you make me cringe.

This is actually good news.

If your Dad tells you this, he may have his reasons. He knows you and your situation better than anyone here ever will.

GNU Social? I'm very new to it, but it seems promising.

There is a part of my brain that I could free up now that I know this video exists.
I was there.

OK, a question: assuming DPR had a decent pass phrase protecting these coins, and assuming the pass phrase isn't tortured or bargained out of him, is it even possible for the seized coins to be sold or otherwise controlled?
In what sense are they "owned" by the government? I just assumed they are now out of circulation.
