If you bought 1 bitcoin for $2000 you still have 1 bitcoin
If the pirce goes to $2600, then your 1 bitcoin is worth $2600

I agree with you in a way but my point was emphasizing on the technology. Yes, bitcoin is decentralized. There's nothing stopping another coin being made which there has been (litecoin, shitcoin, trollcoin) Which are also decentralized and provide the same thing bitcoin is doing. 
Bitcoin is trusted and tested and is being advertised by news media. Once time passes, other better and faster cryptos will take over. I hope I'm wrong like I said, but history tends to repeat itself as we saw with myspace/facebook. Other cryptos have their shit together and can scale indefinitely. 
I personally think nothing will happen on Aug 1st, bitcoin will be the same as it is now and everyone will continue using it. Miners dictate what happens.

Bitcoin is a victim of it's own success lets start there.
The creator was more interested in getting the proof of concept out there. 
What's stopping from big banks and credit gaints from creating their own blockchain "bitcoin lookalike" and operating the same exact way. 
I'm still for bitcoin, even if we are in a bubble we are still in the early stages of it. As we stand now, there are hundreds of other cryptocurrencies that already have their shit together. 
If you're truly a believer in the technology of blockchain I think the long term gamble would be on ethereum. There are thousands of devs actively developing a blockchain foundation for many ICO's and startups to run on. Even IF BIG BANKS, Govt. start shifting to blockchain technology they will most likely use ethereum just because of the resources and time that have been allocated to it. Think of it the same way as an operating system. The whole world uses windows because it doesn't make sense to develop your own due to the amount of time and resources required. 
What worries me is there is noting proprietary about bitcoin other than having the first moving advantage and media blowing up. HODL but I hope I'm wrong.
