  the first electronic cigarette website to accept bitcoins, offers a 5% discount during the currency exchange rate when checking out with Bitcoin.  The guy coded his own Bitcoin payment system for his site and doesn't cash out his bitcoins at all.  Also "redditbtc" is a coupon code for another, 5% off.  Enjoy :)

I would have just whipped up a simple website that lets you download the video after you pay a small fee (and accept Bitcoin).  Simple as that.  Would it end up on The PirateBay? Of course, but doesn't mean they wont have people still buying it. 
That or offer it to the public for free with a donation link.

I traced the bitcoin transactions from one of the Gox address I sent bitcoins to and came across this address: 
I believe it is another MtGox hot wallet.
Found another one that looks like a hot wallet:
@_date: 2014-06-09 07:58:03
Yes. I have an idea for a program which will require me to make basically a custom Bitcoin wallet. Coding the wallet is pretty simple, just having my features link to the Bitcoin network is pretty hard.  As in being able to know how many coins are in a wallet and being able to direct coins from that wallet to another wallet.

Awesome thanks, I'll pm you

Actually i had an old buy order at 165ish usd and the screw up where mtgox sold my shit at 172ish ended up in my favor, but its just uncomfortable to know that the transaction happened with out me doing it.

This doesn't compensate what your return is on your original bet. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:27:41
I've had a gox account since since early 2012 and haven't had any problems yet, but I do keep most of my bitcoins in cold storage, but leave around 10 coins or so on gox just play with.  
@_date: 2013-10-09 01:07:15
OK to ELI5: 1 person bets 10 btc for "high" and 1 person bets 10 btc for "low".  Lets say I bet "low" and I WIN! All I get back is the 10 btc my OPPONENT bet - the fee which is say, 20% which ends up being 2 bitc.  So my TOTAL return is 8 BTC.  So end of the Day I bet 10 bitcoins... WON and returned 8 bitcoins TOTAL.  not 18... only 8... THIS is what this guys current formula returns... seriously take a look at it.
You have to return your original 10 bitcoins PLUS the 10-fee from your opponent to profit... then you return 18 btc with a profit of 8 bitcoins.

As a merchant that accepts bitcoins, I surprisingly haven't thought of this question before! I think I would offer refunds in btc equal to the current market value of Bitcoin. I don't won't someone buying my product, being perfectly happy with it, then Bitcoin goes from 200 to 900 in a few days and expects a refund only to gain from the profit of Bitcoin. 
I think I'll add this to our terms of service right away.

EXACT same formula you used... and you WON the "bet" but lost money.

I put $1000 into it when it was about 2 dollars a coin to get 500 coins.  Lost about half doing day trading over the next couple months and realized I sucked at it. That left me with about 250 coins. I ended up buying random crap and cashing out a few over the next few months leaving me with 150 bitcoins when it reached about 10 dollars. I held onto these all the way to the bubble in April and dumb ass me kept them in mtgox and when the crash happened, mtgox liquidated all of my coins, without me putting in a sell order or anything, near the bottom when it was about 80 dollars a coin. I freaked out that Gox just made a 12000 dollar transaction without my permission and just rebought when it rebounded to about 160ish. Leaving me with about 75 coins.   Later I sold 20 coins at 300 to get 6k. And now I've been riding my 55 coins which I still have today. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:33:01
No i did not!
@_date: 2013-10-09 01:32:00
Don't you think you should at LEAST get your money back plus the very minimal amount of money you won. like maybe 10.1 btc back in return?  not take a lose because you won?

Thanks, I'll look into them

My Bitcoin experience has been great.  I was an early bitcoin adapter (end of 2011) Before I even started ecigfrenzy.  So I've always been a supporter.  I don't liquidate any of the coins my business acquires.  It is hard at times seeing my business' bank account when I need to buy new product but just don't have the free cash on hand because the bitcoin sales are stopping my cash flow.  As for going broke over night? no way... like I said I was an early adapter of bitcoin and believe in it so much.  I'll just ride the swings like everyone else does.  As for the amount of bitcoin buyers, I'd say about 1/5th of my sales are from bitcoins which is awesome!

**READ THIS, YOU WILL LOSE MONEY IF YOU DONT**
Your payout formula is horrible. If I were to put in 10 bitcoins right now saying it would be under, and I WIN. I would come back negative. 
You did everything right EXCEPT return bet amount to the gambler. Change your payout to this:
[[(your bet)(Opposite pool / (Your pool + Your bet)](1-house fee)] + (your bet)
You need to add (+your bet) to the payout formula.
 
@_date: 2013-10-09 01:23:27
Great job.... now look at your ELI5 in this aspect:
opposite pool =1
your pool = 10
your bet=10 
[[(your bet)(Opposite pool / (Your pool + Your bet) + 1)](1-house fee)] = 10*(1/(10+10)+1)*0.8 = 10*(1.05)*0.8 = 10.5*0.8 = 8.4
YOU LOST MONEY AND YOU WON!!!!!
@_date: 2013-10-09 01:54:52
No it is NOT 0+10. 0+10 means your pool=0 your bet =10... look at my original scenario.  your bet=10 and your pool is currently at 10.. My formula is correct. 
As for your other comment yes there is a point where your bet becomes a loss no matter if you win or lose.. THIS IS THE POINT IM TRYING TO MAKE!!!
