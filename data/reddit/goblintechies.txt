Just because $5 is the monthly salary it doesn't mean that it is the real monthly salary.
Venezuelans are dealing heavy in crypto and dollars.

You work as freelance
You work remotely for a overseas company
You work in the few private companies that can pay you in dollar or crypto (but, as a engineer, wages are not like Colombia, Panama of course not even USA, an engineer earning 100-150 usd in a company is a good wage)
Exactly, hence why I made my comment on why the moron suggesting $5 for high quality videos that are worth hundreds of dollars is an imbecile scammer.
Just because "official monthly salary" is $5 it doesn't mean that people can live with $5 they need to get money from elsewhere, like working remotely.

This will never happen, the US basically prints money out of nowhere, while not being able to pay its gigantic debt.
With bitcoin they'd be controlled and nobody could "print money", which means that if the country were to have a crisis it'd be the end of the united states as we know it.

I absolutely hate this modern garbage reporting where big papers give scapegoats the ability to publish under their website however anything bad that happens from it is not their fault because it was labelled as "his opinion".
If you give someone a platform as a newspaper you are validating what they're saying, else don't give them a platform and let him go to a paper that either is of lower quality or is pro his ideology.
I see a lot of posts on the new york times about outrageous things, but when you look at it, in tiny letters there's an "Opinion" tag on it.
Oh but sure, try to post something that they do not agree with and you'll be deplatformed instantly, so what's it then? Do they consent or not what you're posting?
It's absolutely ridiculous and one of the biggest reasons why old media is dying, they hide themselves over an opinion tag and cast away scapegoats as soon as someone criticizes them.

It's easy to tell, no way it just randomly goes up 10% in a day after months of it crashing, people (most) will have at least some doubt before they start buying again, it will start by increasing 1% max per day until it's been long enough for there to be another bullrun, these type of thin air bullruns are mostly caused by whales trying to trick idiots into buying.
