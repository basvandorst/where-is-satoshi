Fully agree. but allow me to give my 2 cents. i think we need to do both: HODL and USE.
To HODL means there will be lesser supply of bitcoin out there in the market for the whole human race. And then we also need to use it so as to bring up the demand. and when there isn't enough bitcoins since the fixed supply is 21 million, the price have to go up. its an inevitable cause-and-effect event. 
and why do we also want to use it is because when vendors accept Bitcoin, they can easily give a discount since there won't be any credit card fees for them, etc. lots of good reasons.
firstly...we all definitely would want to keep whatever we have bought X time ago as they were intended for investments or for whatever reasons. 
BUT we wouldn't mind spending bitcoins if say: i go to Starbucks and order a cup of hot mocha, take out my smartphone and access my app through fingerprint authentication, scan QR code of drink and instantly buy the exact amount of BTC i need to pay for my drink and that will automatically deduct from my bank account. 
This way, we wouldn't have to be so bothered by the price of BTC since its all done within under 30secs. But can this be done yet? Speed wise i am talking about. And also the whole entire process that i just mentioned.
itBit just got some sort of 'bank licensing' i heard. Soooo...i am not sure how all this will come together. but one day it will.

'could be' shorter than the 3 months duration it took for itBit. Because itBit was already operational for a few years. So they had stuff to be reviewed. As  for Gemini, nothing has started yet. Also, since Gemini will be the second one applying for it, the procedure should be a lot more clearer and smoother as it has been done before for itBit. I say, anytime soon between Late August to September.

Show them Ethereum, NXT, NEM, DigiByte, Factom, MyCelium, Expanse, etc. Show them SOMETHING that is REAL WORLD TECH APPLICATIONS.
Look at what Microsoft is doing with Azure and said coins. Look at the banks and whoever has partnered with said coins. THESE ARE REAL. 
Freaking Onecoin only knows some website portal with Hub online tools and e-learning stuff. AND THEN they throw a HUGE SHOW to WOW and AMAZE the minds of those who are so ill-aware of Bitcoin, Digital/Virtual Currencies, Cryptocurrencies. People of the past are more reliant on Human Trust, easily influenced by someone who can act big. But when it comes to THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC, it's not about Trust or some show. THEY TALK BIG but ask them to SHOW IT TO YOU...there's hardly anything to be amazed about.
the mining and storing in a wallet and sending and receiving coins, every other coin can do it too...even S.h.i.t.coin.
