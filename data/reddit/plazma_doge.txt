First, you are right, if you are syncing the correct chain there won't be need to validate. The thing is, there is no way knowing if you are syncing the correct chain because you are getting the information from random people on the internet.

Bitcoin is centralized ( by that I mean is almost all BTC is hold by 0.01% of individuals) that is what dogecoin is fixing. it is not centralized and thats why even if bitcoin fail doge can continue. also not even saying bitcoin has to fail and drop to 0. it doesn't even have to drop in price. it can stay at 10/20bilion market cap for the next 50 years. and dogecoin can go up to trillions. 
   
Edit: Not saying that is going to happen or its even likely but if you are think that its not possible then you are delusional and probably have invested too much in BTC.
@_date: 2014-09-30 07:24:58
Once you buy bitcoins i recommend moving them out of circle. Its better to keep the money yourself then trusting other to do it for you, no matter who they are. You can install a wallet on your phone from the app-store. There is a backup option in the app in case you lose your phone.

Cryptographers use numbers like magicians use magic. Algorithms have complexity the same way spells have mana costs. In order to do their magic, they need it to have low complexity, which is exactly like needing low mana costs in order to cast your spells.
These guys found a new way to cast a powerful spell that people knew existed, but cost way too much mana. Now they can cast it with a lot less mana. Before your armor was good because you could plan on them not having enough mana to cast it. This spell used to cost 100,000 mana, when you can only have 999 mana, even if you're the end boss. They found a way to cast it for 150 mana, so now it's possible to cast it.
This means if you have to fight these guys, and your armor is weak to the same element this spell is strong against, you better get some new armor.

First let me say I'm long and i wont sell my bitcoins for usd probably ever.
Its unlikely that there will be any significant increase in price ( like 100% ) in the near future, All those new companies accepting bitcoin increase the selling pressure for now, since they convert some or all of the BTC to USD.
Also there is speculation the MTGox coins are beeing slowly sold over the past year, and thats like half a milion BTC if i remember. Also before there were miners who were mining and keeping all or most of the BTC, now there are farms that are selling most of the BTC they get.

1) Ignore the fact how much the the USD is getting created per day
2) Code can be changed and optimized to handle more transactions

And then you compare it to how much USD is created per day. 
Also its not 10$ per transaction, its block reward divided by number of transaction. When transaction amount goes up by X times, the cost per transaction goes down X times.
Get 1000 times more people using the network and the fee per transaction will be 0.01$.

Actually they can choose not to accept any denomination. They just deny you service. If you are already in debt with them they can still choose not to take your money and deny you service from that point forward. But your debt is forfeit and you don't have to pay them anymore.

You are mistaken.
They get more money per block. The block reward is the same. but the money you get increases every time some1 else leaves the network. It also decreases every time some1 joins the network. It depends on the % of the total power you control. 
I will run it with the numbers instead of X and Y as one example maybe it will help.
You control 1% of the network. you are getting 36 BTC per day ( 3600 * 1% = 36 ). When half the people stop mining the time per block doubles, but now you control 2% of the network and you are making 36 BTC per day ( 1800 * 2% = 36 ).
You are making the same money/time.

if 1% of people pay 9% and they rest 99% wait for the fee to be 3% then 3% is the fair price so your assumption ( if people are paying 9% than that is a fair price ) is wrong.

When people are mining the hard blocks, with less competition they get the same money/time. as mining the easy blocks with more people. 
Here is example, 
x people mining at y difficulty = x/2 people mining at y * 2 difficulty  = x * 2 people mining at y/2.
2 could be any number, used number to make it easier to understand by the majority. 
Also you will be losing money by not mining for profit during the prolonged period of "hard blocks" that you wont be able to earn back during the shorter period of "easy blocks".

if 30% of the miners shut down ( so the blocks get mines 30% slower ) the 70% will get exactly the same amount as before. 
If there are 30% less money, and there are 30% fewer people that split the money, any1 that is splitting the money get the same amount.

Copy-pasted from litecoin...
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:07:18
You are still making the same money. So as long as you are mining at a profit ( no matter how small it is ) its still more profitable to mine at both easy and hard blocks. One doomsday scenario I can think of is where every1 pays the same for electricity (and other bills) and every1 has the same efficiency on miners and every1 act completely rational and no1 is selling his miners once they become unprofitable for the hard blocks, ( that last point not sure about it: and difficultly isn't increasing to make the miners that are switching for the hard blocks at some point unprofitable for the easy ones also ).
So yea I can see a situation where you are also correct.

Didn't you say that the demand will increase the price? 
So you can keep cutting the reward and they will still earn 10$/ per X time (  saying transactions is incorrect. the number of transactions can increase 1000 fold. Then the cost per transaction will drop 1000 fold. As for the demand will increase price argument, sure and the block halvening will decrease reward, so it balances out does't it. )

Btw this was happening in dogecoin. There was a pool mining different coins called multipool that controlled fairly high % of the power, cant remember exactly but lets say 30%. they hopped in for the easy blocks and then mined other coins while the difficulty readjust. Eventualy the algorithm was changed with hard fork so that difficulty readjusts using some algorithm every block ( not sure exactly )

Most people think that its good idea to get coins before the halving. That creates increased demand, and the price goes up in the months/year before the halving and start selling after the helving once they see that the price didn't go up. Thats why its good to buy as early as possible and sell near the halving. 
TLDR: Demand after the halving is much lower since people are not buying in anticipation of the coming halving.

Volume in BTC is misleading. If the same amount of USD is exchanged for BTC in local bitcoin the volume in BTC increases as price decreases.

Just get ready for the long period of price drops to 1000$ and people saying "cheap coins" and the trolls saying "its been cheap coins all the way down and it will keep getting lower"  it happened when the price drooped from 35-&gt;2$  from 266 -&gt; to 60$ and from 1000 to 150$.
