This guy gives me faith in bitcoin, he’s so damn ambitious about it.

I believe the problem is wallet encryption rather than mining, quantum could brute force wallet keys in minutes rather than years¿

Nice find, neat illustrations

For the majority, this may be the last chance to accumulate 2.1 BTC (one ten millionth of the supply)

This. Especially the girlfriend one, females automatically assume you’re a hacker if they see a terminal

Description would be nice, no idea what you’re promoting here. I’d imagine this sort of thing would be better off in daily discussions

I’d love to see a 21 Million Club edition - similar to how YouTube rewards stars by Subscribers we should be rewarding the members of our HODL community.. Are these for sale?
@_date: 2018-12-31 12:12:00
How to do this?
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:40:33
According to the store they’re Limited Edition (100)

I hope Bitcoin rises just a little just so these guys get a deserved break from this financial nightmare
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:30:28
Top man, thanks!
