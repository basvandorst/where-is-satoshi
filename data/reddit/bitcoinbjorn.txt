Congratulations. Remember, have a 5 year perspective minimum. If you have patience, 10. Welcome to the BTC club!

Ok, that’s cool! 
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:34:42
Trezor or ledger nano. The trezor is more user friendly in my opinion. Don’t buy via resellers, but directly from the company

The spirit has not died, this has happened before! Bull market could last for years, ago knows. BTC is here to stay 
@_date: 2018-06-09 11:50:34
On average BTC has to cost 8K for miners to break even. That number has since the very beginning gone one way, up. Invest and have a 5 years strategy minimum. Bitcoin is already big and recognised, that will just continue. I’ve been holding for several years and only sold a tiny portion to buy some nice things. This is my pension, and a lot of other people’s pension.

That’s a good representation of the situation yes. Looks a lot like amazon after the IT bubble. Look at them today though 
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:59:29
Thanks, appreciate your comment.
And in regards of Swiss banks. It’s just a guess and somewhat conspiracy theory. I am convinced that banks will be putting cryptos on their books in the coming years, and I consider the banks is bitcoin friendly countries having the highest probability of doing so. Have a good one! 
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:17:55

Im sure we have positive times ahead of us, but it might take several years! Hold on to it as long as you can is my opinion

@_date: 2018-03-30 22:07:52
You are right, I should have written: just below the ATH. But still an incredible performance since 2008.
I base my comment on the fact that corporations are buying back stock from the market like crazy and borrowing money at a near zero or negative rate.
“In November 2016, Goldman Sachs’ chief equity strategist David Kostin estimated that, in 2017, S&amp;P 500 companies will spend $780 billion on buybacks — a new record.”

Well, if I’m wrong then your a bully.
This post you made said enough about you as a person. I actually feel sorry for people like you, and like I stated in a previous reply - you are the reason my kids go to kickboxing every week.

Well pardon me mr holy fucker

Personally I don’t consider it a good currency option. If it succeeds people will be holding on to it and only spending it when needed, due to its scarcity. Store of value, currency for big purchases like real estate, cars etc. Good luck :)

@_date: 2018-03-30 22:52:56
Better odds compared to the market for the last three months yes. Please elevate your perspective or even zoom out on the charts ;-)

Yeah, while you’ll be playing World of Warcraft (I see you follow the subreddit)
The amount of aggressive idiots on this platform is amazing!...
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:50:04
Yes, but they outperform the stock market by far on the short term after the dip. Money is moved to gold/silver as it is considered safe and obviously moved back to the stock market mid/long term 
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:11:52
A bot is telling me this is deleted due to me being new on Reddit? But still receiving comments.
Anyone? Can you see it or is it wiped out?
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:26:12
Nice job!!
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:27:32
That’s not the historical case for gold at all.
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:01:52
If you read the whole sentence I finish of by saying, only time will tell.
And yes, you are correct. We are not at ATH’s but just below. The markets are inflated and companies are buying back stocks like crazy and putting up loans at a near zero or negative rate.

@_date: 2018-03-30 22:25:54
Impossible to speculate in this. But I’m sure the next 10 years will have some horror stories of people dying and relatives not being able to access their stash. I think all larger holders have some safety measures in place. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:13:16
Please! It has already spread across the world. 7Billion dollars worth of BTC has changed hands the last 24hours.
BTC is a 5-10 year+ investment.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:56:22
Some of them are probably lost and some are probably people just holding. You can google bitcoin rich list and get an overview over the biggest holders, age etc.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:31:30
Nice contribution to my points and the discussion. I’m not gonna edit my typo and leave it there for you ;-)
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:59:31
And I finished that point by writing: only time will tell.
Traditionally as stock market crashes, gold and silver also dips, but has a way higher return in the short and mid term than the stock market after the dip/crash ocurres. And yes, as things stabilise, money goes back in to the stock market.
I don’t think traditional investors in general, but I do think more liquidity will flow in to crypto as the whole market has a lot of eyes on it. There are a lot of young wealthy people in the world and look at the volume traded in crypto - it has grown exponentially since the beginning. Why? More people are embracing it, some dumb money and some smart money. There is a probability of this happening and there is also a probability of it plummeting like you say if a lot of people exit. If such a scenario occurred it would be up to us as individuals to play our hands well or just hope to make the correct move.

And it doesn’t take much IQ to express an opinion in an educated and intellectual manor without referring to someone as the ugliest piece of human garbage you’ve ever seen.
Educate your self, boy. Boys like you who typically engage in these sorts of things, in such a manor are typically losers, never get laid or get interest from the opposite sex, eat too much pizza, pay for sex and have extremely low self worth.

Trading value mirrors the on going adoption. Some percentage of it is dumb money and some smart.
A lot of people speculate in the price and a lot of people speculate on BTCs competitive position towards gold. Hell, look at all the large public known holders. They’re doing exactly that. If they’re hypothesis is right, price obviously will go up. Do I have a crystal ball, of course not. But none of us can ignore that there exists a probability of BTC/cryptos competing with gold some day in the future.
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:30:48

Of course he is, but this is not something that will break him financial. Obviously no one likes to lose money  
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:10:09
Did you read the end of the sentence you quoted? “Some people disagree on this, but only time will tell”
I for a fact know several people heavily invested in the stock market, including my self that see this as a good hedge. We have stop losses and will move some of that money if things get bad.
But again, like I said: only time will tell

When I got in the market I did check the first few months. Became like an obsession and I also lost 40 BTC day trading like an idiot.
After that I stopped and probably checked the BTC price once a month or less. Basically just forgot about it

I doubt that is possible. KYC and AML is being followed. Anyone who doesn’t ends up with a problem 
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:27:10
No good courses exist imo. Try riding hype waves. I made a nice profit riding the XVG wave, sold out around the peak. Personally I consider XVG one of the biggest shut coins out there.  
Safest strategy, hold and have a 5-10yr+ perspective

@_date: 2018-04-01 23:53:47
All true. There are many coins superior to bitcoin,  even superior to BCH (to the ones on that side of field) - if bitcoin cash had baptised their coin xcoin or supercoin, they would have never have been where they are today.
First mover can be an advantage and disadvantage, only time will tell.
Hell, an acquaintance spoke to me and some others about Verge, convinced that it would become a leader. Reading about it my view is very different.

@_date: 2018-04-09 22:43:37
Coinbase is fine. All exchanges get bashed online. Personally I use Kraken for buying and selling. requires verification and might take a week or two.
I’d recommend you to buy a trezor or ledger nano to store your coins.
If you are buying to spend enjoy the spending. But if you are buying to invest, think long term. 5years+ at least.
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:25:24
I trust in the developers to continue doing a great job and promised myself to separate this coin from my portfolio, period!
There are a lot of scandals, fake news and so on. I think that just will continue and become even more sophisticated. 
I had a break from reading the news and checking my portfolio for 3.5 years (2014 - 2017) Why, because every time I did - I ended up questioning my own judgement, the tech, my evaluation. Same stuff was going on as it is today, people were screaming and articles would be saying it died. You could find predictions contradicting each other every day. 
I don’t consider the odds are high, to predict the fall of bitcoin if that ever happened, the spreads on the exchanges are not to huge and if someone sold a huge aka Winklewoss twins amount, it would flash crash and go to zero, with all buyers not placing new orders. But this I don’t think will happen, probability is not high in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:21:13

Hi Mark,
I know you have received a lot of shit from people, but as we all can understand people have been stressed and sad due to their losses. When that’s said, the trolls and fools are the loudest online. I wish for your best and hope this goes through.
Does a CR imply that mtgox has to be reopened? In short, what has to go through to make that happen? I wish for the best outcome for the creditors and I think you will get a lot of respect and appreciation if it goes through. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:33:31
Haha! Nice!
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:45:19
I guess they’ve all been sold now, since we’re above that price.
Quite a huge amount to sell on an exchange. Why in God’s name not go OTC with such an amount? That’s approximately 50MUSD  
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:07:15
Don’t forget that if that scenario happens, Facebook, google cloud, banks, everything that’s in the cloud will be vulnerable. Something that would be a disaster. That scenario is way more nuanced than bitcoin or crypto
