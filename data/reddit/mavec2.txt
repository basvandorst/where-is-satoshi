Which "professionals"? Jamie Dimon's ilk? Absolutely OP should do their due diligence but researching and asking questions on the Internet is a good strategy. I don't trust these so-called professionals personally.

Why are several major exchanges not even on the segwit adoption list? Like Bittrex, Poloniex...

Is this really true or did you read this in The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell? ;)
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:51:01
Wrong. It's 62% market cap, higher percentage wise than some months ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:47:12
Mmmmm might get it today, just 1 day late :)

christ he really did it. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:38:53
You don't really know that do you. Furthermore many exchanges now keep their btc in cold storage, well almost all of it anyway so a mt gox couldn't really happen

I think it will act as the reserve currency and other coins will be exchanged more frequently.

When is the date of the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:35:05
Thanks, and the Segwit2x fork is the one many people think will be potentially more consequential, correct?
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:28:06
i mean why is it called bitcoin? seems like the same order of logic.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:13:23
Could you provide a source or link please? Not that I don't believe you, I'm just curious.

HTF do you know he broke the law? Do you live in the country where he lives? Do you have the same nationality as him? Doubt it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:32:10
I think bitstamp will work, you don't need official residency to get verified.

I am very sorry to hear your story, that really sucks. I hate that so many people are being rude and rushing to judgment about you on this post. This kind of thing could happen to any of us, sure you could have been more careful but.. The number of people who are 100% careful is probably like 0.0001%.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:40:56
this is related to this fucking bullshit that bitcoin is mostly used by criminals and for illicit activities, fucking bastards.
