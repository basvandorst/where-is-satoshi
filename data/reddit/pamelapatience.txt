To make it easy to understand what a replay attack is, consider an online payment via credit card. Once you input your card details, a hacker may have recorded them, allowing them to “replay” the details and steal your funds.
In terms of Bitcoin, a “hard fork” can put you at risk of a similar “replay attack”. A “hard fork” is when the blockchain is split in two, usually due to a proposed technical upgrade. In this case, a hard fork is planned for 16/11/17 as a new chain will allow the Bitcoin block size to double from 1MB to 2MB in what is known as the “Segwit2x” fork. The current Bitcoin chain maintained by the Bitcoin Core team will still be known as BTC, while the new chain maintained by the Segwit2x team will be known as B2X.
During the split, you will get your coins in a 1:1 ratio on both blockchains, however they will have the same private keys. This is where the risk of a replay attack comes from. The attacker can “replay” the transaction details on one blockchain, on to the other one. This transaction will be valid on both chains because the node accepts it since they have the same private key. Let’s say you spend 1 BTC on one chain. The replay attacker can spend the same amount on the new chain and it will be accepted by the network.
This is why replay protection is so important during a fork, as Segwit2x does not offer replay protection. The BTC.com wallet seems like a solution to this problem as it offers full protection against replay attacks. If you believe them. 
They support both sides of the chain after the fork, therefore transactions can be done without issue after the fork. To avoid the possibility of a loss of funds due to replay attacks with the upcoming fork, it is highly recommended to store funds on a wallet with replay protection before the split occurs.
