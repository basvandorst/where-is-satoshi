I would suggest to use Satoshi (for main blockchain and lightning network) and mSatoshi for smaller denomination on the lightning network (it's 1/1000th of a Satoshi)

By using a wallet such as Trezor you are using a mnemonic seed which is a way for the Trezor to generate your private-keys and with that it can see the history on the blockchain. It then allows you to use those private seed to construct transactions with the inputs from those private keys. 
It does hold you keys but it has no control over if you can send/receive bitcoin, you could for example use the same seed on two devices. What the Trezor is keeping secure is the seed, mostly by not allowing it to leave the device for example it construct the transaction which you can broadcast on the device and not on your computer or phone.

I never said that there is easier ways to spend it, for example mastercard/visa. I just pointed out that it's easy to spend already, and it will only get easier. On the total sum I probably paid 1% in fees, about 10$.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:45:48
I agree that it's not stupid to want the unbaked people in 3rd world countries to become banked with bitcoin. But it's naive to think that just because you make room for more space suddenly everyone in the 3rd world would start to use it within. Even if you would raise the blocksize to 16x you would eventually run into the same problem.

Wait what!? Not a currency becuse it's not a Store-of-value and/or not able to spen it? So when I bought a new laptoo, headset, hairtrimmer and a electric mixer yesterday it wasn't too easy to spend?

I've used bech32 a few times but when I've used the wallet can't use the combined value of my Satoshis on the bech32, P2PKH and P2SH addresses to sign a transaction. 
I'm not sure but I think Samurai wallet supports those types of transaction but I have never tried it out.
Does anyone know about this and how it actually is? 
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:17:16
Sweden has the same just ignore them and keep hodl. I would even be inclined to go to court on paying capital gains taxes on purchases.
It's absurd to think I will remember and calculate the 30% gain tax on an item that costs example 100kr (~10$) or even under 10000kr.

@_date: 2018-05-18 10:40:02
I believe that he is a bit wrong about the taxation. For example the government will always be able to regulate businesses and therefore force them to give up how much they pay me every hour/day/week/month/years and then they just will say "you need to pay X% on that or else you will go to jail", or they even might just take it directly from the business without asking you. And where I'm from an overwhelmingly majority would support the government in doing so.

Not first time that Bitcoin is on a "news" paper frontpage in Sweden, also swedes don't see the point with bitcoin since they already can send money for free between banks and also swish. Swish is a payment (oligopoly) system between the larges bank in Sweden where you can send up to 23K usd instant to anyone via their connected phone number. Also swedes believe that the government has answers for everything even if the interest rate from the central bank is below 0. Which is very sad.
Bitcoin needs to be like swish before I see real mainstream adoption both from regular people and businesses here. Right no bitcoin is no where that stage but the future looks bright.
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:44:53
Wtf are you writing about, no currency goes to 0. And you are saying that the most flexible money ever created, bitcoin, is going to 0. Hahahahah and you also assume that the goverment could coordinate it becuse they are so good to coordinate everyting else.
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:00:07
Okey, why? It's more disgusting that you can't transfer that amount times 10 from bank to bank within less than lets say 1 hour or even instant for free in some countries.
Btw I understand why, I also find it weird to ban a certain amount you can get payed/pay with just because it's cash. Even though I never use cash.

Well all mined coins can be moved and dumped on the market, we only know of some that is lost. So if Satoshi only moves a bitcoin from the genesis block so we know for sure that it's him, that would only show that someone has his private key either by cracking sha256 which is much worse than Satoshi moving his coins or it's him and bitcoin works as intended.
The market would be shooked by both events but for the first issue there would be a fix deployed directly by users (I even think there is a fix for that already). 
The second issue is that the market would go down because people think Satoshi would sell his coins so they sell their coins which moves the price down. Still it isn't Satoshi dumping his coins it's the fear of loosing money from the people who invested in Bitcoin and those people are probably not HODLers.

Sorry for your loss, you should try to retrive all coins from exchanges since it a huge risk to store them on exchanges since they can loose the coins if hacked. 
Retrive them to a wallet such as breadwallet (ios) mycelium (android), follow the steps and BACKUP THE SEED! Transfer all funds to your wallet, then if you want to sell them find an exchange where you can convert them to your local currency, Bitfinex I assume would work fine. (It's not popular to say that you are going to sell on this subreddit, so HODL is the best option!) :D

I've been looking into making something similar but not where you engrave more like cryptosteel. And I think the price is too much even at 55€ for an bitcoin noobie to buy it. Same with HW wallets and those together should be bundled for 50€. Otherwise good with more competition.

I don't really have the know how to produce those and at the cost I want which is like 20€ or cheaper. I think this kind of product really needs a low barier to entry even though this might secure their password/coins people will still see it as a fancy pice of metal especially if they just have 50€ of satoshis.
But having a fireproof thing to store you master seed/password should be ubiquitous, and I'm pretty sure everyone need it for their passwords.

I agree, but he also points out that becuse of the mining and influence in China, will make China able to manipulate the currency and thats why he dosn't want the US to be relying on the same currency.

Remember that FakeSatoshi said that he was going to run a non SegWit pool so yes it's not over!
But SegWit block fit more transactions because the transactions are smaller, it could mean that all fees are in SegWit block because the users is using SegWit because it's cheaper per kb so the miners have a incentive to switch. But the most income for a miner comes from the block reward so the fees aren't a huge deal for them yet.
@_date: 2019-08-04 09:43:34
You also allow more transactions to fit in a block if you use segwit addresses especially bech32.

Depends on how easily/fast you want to be able to send your precious satoshis.
For example I have a Trezor which I use to save my bitcoin but I can loose it destroy it with out being worried becuse I store the seed in metal for that trezor in some other location.
Then to be able to spend Bitcoin I uses Bitcoin Lightning Wallet and have that seed saved on paper which is laminated. That wallet allows lightning and onchain transactions but I only keep a few million satoshis on it.
But start with getting a hardware wallet such as a trezor or ledger. I myself uses a trezor and haven't heard anything bad about ledger. So I recommend both.
One more pro tip, save in bitcoin by buying smaller units every week/month. But it's up to you to define "smaller units". ��
@_date: 2019-10-18 12:08:36
Who is funding the incomming channel? I assume that Acinq has a bunch of pre opened channels which it uses and you have to pay for when getting an incoming payment. But what if the incoming payment is just 1 sat? And how big is that channel? Also what about watchtowers do you pay for that at the same time?
We need a wallet that the user never know's it's using chennels and also has third party watch towers. I would think that it's enough incentive for a wallet provider to provide those things for free in exchange of fees when routing payments. Also opening incomming channels for free and directly when you need a new channel becuse the other is full.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:22:47
Not sure, if you just want to test ipv6 then you might just disable ipv4 completely but it's not a solution since you probably want o use ipv4 still. It probably also depends on which lightning software you are running.

Bitcoin is the best money ever created because it's limited and it's digital. If it gets even ~~10%~~20-25% of Gold's marketcap it will be well over 100k á coin. 
Also fiat is inflationary as long bitcoin's demand goes up a bit until the block reward is no more it will go up against fiat currencies and therefore reach 250k at some point. But the demand for bitcoin will skyrocket if people wants to protect their wealth when their fiat currencies collapses which it always does.

Yeah, I've tried yo use it but imo it's useless currently. I tried to make lightning payments to my other lightning wallet which failed but I managed to close the channel but I'm unable to send onchain transactions from the wallet and I get a fee estimation error. 
Imo the best lightning wallet is Bitcoin Lightning Wallet by anton kumaigorodski.
It has never failed me. 
Just add a smaller sum to the onchain wallet exampel 10$ then open a channel with it. After the channel is open, you have watch-towers and backed it up to google drive then go to lnbig.com and create a receiving channel and  scan/open the channel in BLW. 
Now you are ready to send and receiving satoshis. 
Maybe buy some more over at hodhodl? ;)

I mean if you are sending it to a onchain address then no it won't go through plus500. And if you mean that they will act as a middle man who forwards the payment to the address, then yes. But a big why? Since you are wasting time and money doing that.

You can create an "account" on the blockchain that has a more human readable name and then people can make a "transaction" with a smart contract to that name and not directly to that user's address which makes them spendable for that user. 
But this requires wallets that understand that type of data on the blockchain and the transaction you are doing is larger and therefore more expensive. 
Can't remember what it's called, something with state please comment if you know the name. But it was very recently I read about it.

How does they who enforce this law know how much you bought anonymously if you are anonymous?
@_date: 2019-12-20 15:06:16
Isn't it that we think it's unspendable but we don't really know for sure that it's unspendable since we don't have the private key or something like it?

@_date: 2019-04-04 10:56:48
Yes you can. You could get the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet from google play then use lnbig.com to open a reciveing channel and then use an "exchange" like shapeshift that will give you a onchain address to send the bitcoins to then it will send the lightning funds to your wallet via the channel you opened. 
It requires one onchain transaction.
@_date: 2017-04-19 13:38:16
I haven't used btc.com wallet but I know wallets such as breadwallet generate a new reciveing address after it got a transaction. On top of my head this is to get a better privacy but probably more things that I can't remember at the moment.
It might be that btc.com's wallet is doing the same thing. If you need a wallet I would recommend mycelium (only available on android for now) or Breadwallet for iOS.

It's in the eye of the beholder, I wasn't talking about the bitcoins on their printed private key I was talking about the actually physical thing which to me those has no collectors value. But I would value those bitcoins on that private key more if it was a block reward never moved for privacy.

I've used Bitstamp 99% of my purchases I've made some purchases on FYB-SE and BTCX before I moved to bitstamp. Both of them are legit and used by Swedish residents. I 've never had any problems with those I mentioned.

The guy owning the Tesla is the owner of the swedish exchange bt.cx which allow purchases with Swish which is an app with the support from all major and some minor banks in sweden.

Empty causacius coins instead of Bitcoin, people are really weird or they don't know what they are buying.

I would claim that POS doesn't really work and if you claim that it does please show an real world example. Closes to POS imo is lightning where your liquidity is rewarded with a fee when processing transactions. (it's obviously not the same as POS mining)

Can you spend your Bitcoin on the cash app with the card? Or do you need to convert it to fiat first to your card connected account?
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:17:40
Damn, that much. Why not buy more bitcoin instead. That's what i would do and why I don't see any value that collector thing. But I wonder if it would be the same price if someone removes the bitcoin from it's private key minus the bitcoins value ofc.

I recommend Samurai Wallet on Android but Mycelium also works, but if you want to use lightning too then you should use BLW (Bitcoin lightning wallet) all these wallets are available on google play. Can't recommend anything on iOS since I never used any. On PC i suggest Electrum  . You can use the portable version to put on a usb drive so if the PC crashes you still have it. 
BUT ALSO DO NOT FORGET TO DO A BACK UP OF THE SEED, CHECK IT TWICE. And think where you place the backup or wallet.

Yup, I'm aware but it's still a great wallet imo and a noob won't ever do what that post said in the end.


And as a android developer I'm really glad for samurai wallet and sentinel since I can use most of their code which is open-source. I'm also really sadden that Google has forced features to be removed since it's against their Google Play policy.

I have no problem with BitPay providing a service for merchants but it's how they make you pay with a premade transaction were they set a fee which is well above what you can pay with and get confirmed within an hour. Just to inflate the price for the customer so the customer would think that ShitCoin Cash has lower fee. And they also use leagacy addresses for the same reason still after more than 2 years since segwit got activated.
And on top of that now they have added KYC/AML mesures when paying some merchants, but that's probably becuse of leagal reasons.

Bitcoin is not about an ETF, it's about helping those who are unbanked to get "banked" and be able to have a sound money currency which the goverments can't manipulate.

I installed it on my OnePlus 2 and I've encountered a few bugs.
1. I created a new address and when I switched to it in 'receive' I got a popup saying I should do a backup but I couldn't dismiss it or choose to make a backup so I needed to restart the whole app.
2. I enabled 'recent transactions' in the settings and made a transaction to it, the card didn't come up until I refreshed the 'Home' tab and I'm unable to open the transaction when tapping on it and if I click to open 'Recent transactions' after tapping on the transaction from the card it gets stuck in the loading spinner and never load anything and when I try to go back it says 'starting'.

Well the question is more complex because you need to understand what really happened during the SegWit activation and all possible outcomes. It was really activated with a UASF (user activated soft fork) which needs about 30% of miners support to survive (If I remember it right). But who knows what would've happen. From what I understand is that SegWit also lays a foundation for Schnorr, Confidential Transactions/Bulletproofs and more optimizations and implementation so imo not activating SegWit would be a setback for bitcoin technically. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 10:21:56
I actually though of a similar implementation couple of days ago (Not claiming I was the first I just thought of it on the train ride home) but then I saw bitwala also has a bitcoin debit card which is the same as bitpay's card. 
But my concept was to remove Visa, Mastercard etc from the equation entirely by going to the  manufactures of the card terminals and implementering a a way where you sign a transaction to the merchant just by plugin in your card to the card terminal and entering your pin/password.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:27:18
