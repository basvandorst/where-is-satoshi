I've had bad luck with them freezing funds unnecessarily. Won't use them again.

I don't know if OP intended this as a joke post or not, but it's actually pretty revolutionary how easy it becomes to transfer money if Bitcoin takes off. I've had to deal with upwards of $40 fees for sending money to my father overseas via international wire transfer.

Yikes. I never liked Wells Fargo (who once put a bullshit "consulting fee" on my account when I called with a question), or Bank of America for that matter. I've been with a credit union for years and get treated so much better.

Sorry for your loss, OP. Makes me damn glad I enabled two factor authentication on my Coinbase account.

Hopefully the Coinbase guys are getting free coffee at work, and interviewing for new hires!

I setup a new account with Coinbase this last weekend. I'm still waiting for the bank verification to happen. I was expecting it to have happened by now. It's been 3 business days. :-(

You are correct. I just got verified with them. They made two small deposits to my checking account and send a code using Authy for my phone. There was no ID or utility bill involved.

reddit has a Save feature.

I don't think it can be regulated. Look at Bittorrent. It's flourishing despite powerful groups wanting it shut down.

I know that feel, OP. I bought in at $1092. However, I used only money I could afford to lose (disposable income, play money, whatever you want to call it), so it's more like entertainment to me to see people freaking out. 
And I plan to hold on for awhile. A few months at least. Maybe we'll all look back on this 30% (?) correction and laugh when it's $5,000 USD per BTC.
