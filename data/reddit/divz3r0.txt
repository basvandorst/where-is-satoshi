Good point. Apparently "1000s" of printers are supported. I'm guessing you can find a non-thermal one :)

Hong Kong has its own separate currency, banking and political systems. To get from China to Hong Kong you pass through immigration control as if it was an external country.  Officially it's "part of China", but it has a high degree of autonomy.

By pushing the fees onto the customers and making them aware of the inherent fee differences, this could be good news for Bitcoin. When buying bitcoin becomes super easy, doing that to save 3% (but still have instant payment &amp; shipping) would be attractive to customers.

So we're freezing everything as of now, but we promise not to do this again... until we need to?

Bitcoin itself may not need regulation – it's the crossovers between crypto currency and fiat that seems to so many problems (sometimes due to the regulation of fiat).

So kind of like the South Korean Won!

Dogecoin is definitely a good fit for this :)

Sadly you can never un-notice it now, enjoy seeing the world in teal and orange!

What about the new/used distinction?
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:24:05
Possible theory to explain a "hot wallet leakage": every time they notice the hot wallet is depleted, they top it up from the cold wallet, while not noticing the accounting discrepancy of how many BTC they should have vs. how many they actually have. Depending on how long that went on until someone noticed the accounting issue, I guess it could be pretty big.

but there's already a term for satoshi's!

Inspired by Dogecoin's Ð?

hmm. not super excited about buying a pico-bitcoin…

Fair criticism perhaps? We can do better.

By definition, a newly created item would be delivered before a used one, so I'd say this matters a lot.
If they were not using them beforehand, then their incentive would be to ship the new ones as fast as possible.

It looks like a totally different idea, with CoinPlanter the coins are planted by the community. Coinding appears to be an centrally organised deal, and has not even launched.

Not to mention that at this point the second paragraph is just a promise. It does seem like the Gox model so far, just with arguably more trustworthy individuals. Show us the verification!

Fun design. Would be cool if the binary was a bit more random (or even, actually said something!).
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:31:45
Thats peachy. We are paranoid too, so show us the verification otherwise what is the value of your best intentions?
@_date: 2014-03-17 16:59:30
I see your point about perceived value due the hoarding (something people want must be valuable, right?). But there needs to be an end-game for all the hoarding, like actually spending it one day which I think is what the OP is getting at. Otherwise it will revert to a bunch of useless numbers.

newer versions of iOS ask if the USB connection is a trusted connection, so you can plug in anywhere, just don't hit "Trust" :)

A worthy cause if you ask me. Does he have an active address?
@_date: 2014-03-28 07:50:48
This is unrelated to offline generation – all addresses are created without needing to check a central authority. The chances of a collision are infinitesimally small. If you *could* force a collision you would actually gain ownership of that address's balance, Bitcoin is obviously designed to avoid that!

Reputation bounties are surprisingly successful on SO. They draw heaps of attention to the question. As long as you have enough rep to begin with to offer one.
Maybe they could simply allow people to pay for a reputation bounty. SO keeps the cash, the answerer just gets the rep (as others have noted, avoids the whole pay-for-answer issue).

He only mined a few hundred at the start, and most were sold to pay medical bills, apparently.

The problem affects more than just posters sadly:
