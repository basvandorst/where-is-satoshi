Mempool behavior is not part of nakamato consensus, so behavior may vary depending on miner software, but typically you will drop if the memPool gets too large or after two weeks:

Last time we cleared out the ~100sat/byte transaction pool was around January 1st/2nd (  ). I'd say there is a non-trivial chance your transaction will be dropped entirely. You might need to do a CPFP

Yep -- we had a blacklist of unicode characters but disabled it for this competition to make it more fun. all of the more advanced hacks actually rely on this initial step.
The next layer of security, as you have discovered, involves actually disabling classes.

php is bad because
1. a lot of people who program in php are dabblers, not long term php developers
2. a lot of php developers use pre-built plugins or tools which are not optimized in any sense for security.

For example, it would be useful to know if you want a video on how to set up your programming environment.

I think you can teach about monetary systems and cryptography without giving people wallets. Use tokens, and heck you can even teach RSA to kids (the math is not hard). Show the impact of inflation and other policies. Finally, tie the tokens to some real world thing like an end of semester prize.

@_date: 2014-06-09 20:11:32
If you rely on a 3rd party API (blockchain, coinbase, etc), then yeah -- integration is usually just via JSON. SPV is a bit heavier, since most require a separate thread running in the background.
@_date: 2015-01-09 03:45:23
Ah I see -- so just by IP address. That seems reasonable. I guess this wont work for shared hosting, but I doubt people are running full nodes under that situation

$0.37 @_date: 2015-01-07 02:34:16
The elephant in the room, that nobody in this sub appears willing to admit, is that computer security is complicated. Similarly, dedicated devices are expensive. This will inevitably make multisig the only reasonable solution for the average consumer unless there is global adoption. Although that's a step up from current banking, it gives power to a 3rd party to see and restrict transactions.

gotcha -- so you mean within a single client. I presume you can't send a transaction that depends on a nonconfirmed transaction and expect the network to propagate it?
@_date: 2015-04-16 04:29:05
thanks for the clarification. I guess that actually makes a lot of sense. I'll have to experiment a bit to see whether this carries over with popular spv clients, since downloading the blockchain is a deal breaker.
