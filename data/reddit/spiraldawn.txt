To help bring about a future where currency isn't just another predatory game for the rich. What I'm seeing now, the 'bitcoin isn't for people who live on $2 a day' mentality isn't the Star Trek future I'm looking for. That's just the same 'us first, and screw the outsiders' sentiment I see everywhere. It used to be a peer to peer currency, but as soon as the dollar signs start flashing in people's eyes, it's becoming another elitist party. Why are we here? To lift each other up, or to try to be the first in the door when the 1% deign to allow themselves to become the 1.0000001%?

Starting to look about right. One's accessible to everyone, the others only for those rich enough to afford hoverbikes. I hope this fee issue gets figured out. It's not the Star Trek future i singed up for.

Golden lambos? That's what bitcoin's about now? What happened to a golden age of freedom?

Damn, my analogy game is weak. Shoulda hit Wikipedia to research earthworms first. So embarrassing.

I'll refer you to the comments section any post on r/bitcoin if you'd like further examples. Have a nice day!

I'm curious. Are people just ok with this? Not even my bank treats me like that. I'm starting to wonder if this is sustainable.

If you slice a worm in half, and each half grows into a new worm, who decides which of the two is the original? If there is no absolute indicator of what is Bitcoin, then it's a futile effort. If only the creator of Bitcoin had published some sort of whitepaper laying out what it should be and do... that way we'd know what coin is performing in that manner and which others had spun off into something entirely different altogether.
