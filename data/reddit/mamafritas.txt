I mean...you can just swipe your credit or debit card virtually everywhere and they'll take it. Plus any reasonably developed country has a place where you can exchange physical currency (and they'll all take USD) either in the airport or when you cross the border.

Well decorated I suppose, but it's not like he designed his own luxury mansion/prison like Pablo Escobar.  Still a normal sized prison cell.

I mean, they don't *always* win, but $100k might be pretty hard for some random Joe to sweep under the rug.

I'll preface this by saying Bitcoin could easily keep on going up seemingly forever, BUT...
A currency rising this fast de-incentivizes its users from actually spending it.   
From my, albeit limited, understanding of the transaction system, the fees are becoming too high for small to medium sized purchases since you can buy your way to the front of the line.  We saw Steam pull out yesterday.  This is supposed to be alleviated, but when?
A currency that can't efficiently be spent probably shouldn't be worth so much, especially when (again, from my limited understanding) alternative cryptocurrency seem to have better technology behind them.
Remember, it's a currency, not shares of stock in a business. You may get rich, but this isn't a healthy currency.

FWIW, Al Capone spent his time in a pretty standard cell in Alcatraz

Yeah, I know my email and username tied to the account... I have an idea of what my password is, but it's been so long since I've used it.

Anyone else having issues recovering password?

I've been sitting on a single bitcoin for a long time now.  I've had it explained to me a few times, but I just don't really see why the value should keep going up and up and up.  
It makes sense to me as a payment method along the lines of Paypal, but why should the actual currency be valued so high?  How much bitcoin is actually being spent to purchase goods/services vs how much is just being held by people looking for an early retirement?  I've been aware of it since it was valued at a few bucks per coin. It didn't surprise me when it hit $10/50/100/500/1000/9000. It won't surprise me when it gets to $10k or even if it gets to $100k, but I still won't really understand why.  Seems like you have 99% of the currency just being held while a very small few actually use it for its intended purpose.  I'm not predicting a crash or whatever, but that just doesn't sound like a healthy market.

I understand that there's a limited total amount of whole bitcoins that can/will be mined, but with how easy it is to make a new crypto currency, is the supply truly limited?  
And, not that I've researched other cryptos a ton, but from my limited reading, some consider alternatives to be superior, so why should bitcoin remain on top for the long term? 
I dunno, I watched the video and it didn't really tell me anything I hadn't heard before.

For what it's worth, Fidelity's login was down for over an hour this morning from the high volume due to NASDAQ taking a tumble today.
