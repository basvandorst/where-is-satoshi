Congrats on becoming $1,000+ poorer.

Weird. Never seen any metric tools or hardware not measured in millimeters.
Does everything come in decimeters where you live?

My "[Keyboard to Leopard]( Chrome extension just paid off.

You must really hate millimeters.

I was hoping you'd come. Thank you, bot. Thank you so much.

I still use them for some of my legacy systems, mostly for playing games on my Pentium 1 machine.
Never had anything corrupted. Are you storing them near magnets?

Ones like Michio Kaku who get paid a ton of money to talk about how different everything is going to be in 5 years and how new technology will change the world.
I still have a copy of Popular Science from 2000 talking about how the world will be in 2015. Only a few more months before I move to the Mars colony and all my organs are replaced with nanobots!

A few months back there was an episode that made a serial killer an MLP fan. That show has a way of taking something moderately obscure and applying it to serial killers.

This one, which I just actually looked up for the first time. I knew where it was, but had never gotten around to going over there. Apparently it got turned into a school and other things. Accross the street was a slight simplification, since I live less than a mile away on Glades.
Every computer engineering professor at FAU will tell you that facility is condemned because of asbestos. TIL they haven't checked it out either.
@_date: 2015-03-15 06:37:52
Well, IBM also created the standard PC as we know it today.
I live across the street from where the first prototype was built. It's closed and condemned now because of asbestos.

You could swallow it, and re-swallow it whenever it passes.

The way I see it, why bother keeping BTC any safer than your cash or gold?

You really don't understand metallurgy, do you?
The metal that a gun is built from is mostly high-carbon steel. This steel is heated and cooled in an annealing process that causes the iron and carbon to form a pseudocrystallic structure that is incredibly resistant to high temperatures. Even then, the metal is very precisely machined into parts that fit together with a margin of error less than 0.0001".
Make a 3D printer capable of reaching temperatures in excess of 1,200 degrees Celsius with a printing accuracy of 0.00005" or better, find a way of printing the parts without warping and distorting, and figure out how to evenly anneal the finished parts without warping or distorting them *more*, and maybe then you'll have a gun.

I like this idea.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:30:19
No, I avoid corporate-controlled news so I miss a lot of stuff.
Exactly what plastic can be melted by a 3D printer but can withstand the heat and pressure of a gunshot? Definitely not PLA or ABS.

And maybe he'll have a smartphone! /s
I think you missed it, bud. The joke was superior technologies/concepts that don't exist or aren't mainstream yet. Not things that are already common.

Now this is fun.
1. Modify the safe to include a battery-operated UHF transmitter, GPS receiver, and tilt-switch. The system turns on when tilted and can only be disarmed by a switch inside the safe. When active, the system reads GPS coordinates and transmits them, with a simple encryption scheme, over UHF every 10 minutes. To recover the safe after a tornado or flood, Use a directional UHF receiver to get a general direction as well as GPS coordinates which would put you within 16'. A rechargeable lead-acide battery of reasonable size to fit in a retrofitted document safe would be able to power the beacon for days, possibly weeks at a time. And, yes, good document safes could easily survive tornadoes.
2. Build several of these safes. Include a simple FTPS server where the current password is an MD5 hash of the data stored on the device already. This way you can...
3. Store several boxes at different locations, hidden or with trusted friends. You can update the contents of the boxes over the Internet. Securing this data transfer can be done in numerous ways. Considering the small amount of data being sent, you could use several layers of encryption for this purpose.
4. Store a couple of boxes underground around your house. As long as they have power and a network connection of some sort, they'll be fine.
5. If you want to store a small amount of data for a very long time, encrypt it on a USB drive, strip the USB drive from its plastic housing, and submerge it in clear epoxy resin. The drive is now all but indestructible and could easily be disguised as anything, with a bit of creativity.

You've got a point. I'm no gun person but I noticed my local Wal-Mart was selling shotguns for almost $2,000. Pistols ranged between $600 and $900.
I fond myself wondering how guns are so common in violent, impoverished areas.

A 3D printer capable of printing in hardened steel in such a manner that the steel forms the appropriate pseudocrystal structure required to hold its shape under the heat and pressure of firing?
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:48:00
Fair enough. My PC runs all-out just about 24/7 anyway and I don't even mine. I suppose regular users would be able to see a difference in their electricity usage.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:40:34
Last I checked, my home IP gets pinged by a server owned by Microsoft about once every hour. I don't use wifi to transmit anything sensitive, and my router has a MAC whitelist. All of my sensitive files are stored on an external drive.
I'm feeling pretty safe.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:57:06
How? I don't think a 3D printed gun would be any better at going through a metal detector than a manufactured gun. Let alone physical searches and TPR scans.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:21:32
I'm reasonably certain that a 3D printed gun would still have a fairly unique set of imperfections on the inside of the barrel.

The consumer would be using electricity playing your game even if it were not bitcoin mining.

(Newb here)
Not sure if joking. Isn't half of the appeal of Bitcoin the concept that it would survive a collapse of the banking system?
Also, why would keys be hard to keep safe? Text file on USB drive with 512-bit AES encryption, twice with different keys, kept in a fireproof safe.
Maybe this is a *whoosh* moment.

Enough to kill someone? Considering the extremely low hit/miss ratio of a real-life firefight where dozens of bullets are shot and maybe one or two people get hit.

I have no BTC of my own, anyway. How often would you update the data?

Hrmmm... Last I checked forensics had a lot of ways of tracing any gun.
