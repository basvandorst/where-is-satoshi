How is this not having a positive effect on price?
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:43:34
Great back to 8k we go
@_date: 2018-08-04 12:50:58
Guys it's over. If this kind of news dumps the market then I've lost hope

Don't you understand that Bitmain would not fuck up its own investment by going over 51 percent and thereby likely impacting bitcoin's price negatively? It's in its interest for the price to be as high as possible.

He's trying to disconnect himself from checking the price

If you're looking at gdax it's just the arbitrage bots you're seeing

You don't understand what an ETF is. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:33:08
Where do you see this?
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:07:47
8k easy
@_date: 2019-08-08 20:25:36
Watch out. Any mention of ethereum will get you downvoted here.

We heard you the first time. Volume trolling is so pointless. These markets are unpredictable, just accept that and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2019-08-22 17:30:06
Good luck... the number of possible combinations of 24 words is too high to solve in a meaningful timeframe.

Hammer day candle looks good. Havent had that for a while
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:49:04
And yet they mine mainly btc. Money matters to them most.
@_date: 2018-06-26 09:17:52
Is the volume high? Where?
@_date: 2018-06-26 09:31:34
I managed a month in May. Pretty relaxing. First few days are the hardest.
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:19:15
Shit like this used to cause a spike...
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:58:38
Nah moon time bitch
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:34:33
That was due to anticipation for blockchain week. Now there is no catalyst in sight. I've given up tbh
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:08:57
I laughed. Although they did win there the first time.
@_date: 2018-06-26 10:48:34
Yes when the earth ends
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:24:21
Yup we seem to be set for a pump
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:54:59
Bitcoin was never at 25k. True story...
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:26:42
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:29:39
This is such immense nonsense
@_date: 2018-03-13 09:44:47
What nonsense
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:46:45
Having an opinion on a financial market is like having an opinion on a dice roll. Just accept it's random.
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:55:39
Yeah just pick the chart that best fits your hoped for market move... 
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:02:00
We will end this day well in the green
@_date: 2018-03-13 09:43:45
One of these days we'll have a massive short squeeze of all shorters expecting the usual dump. Hope it is today.
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:45:54
These fud attempts are becoming more boring
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:48:35
If this is all the google news does to the price then I think we're going up soon
@_date: 2018-03-14 08:42:06
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:34:11
No Lambo for you then
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:17:59
Pff how the OP deleted the reference to Ether. Come on guys we don't need fake news like that
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:19:11
Come on short squeeze
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:34:05
Almost every time... you must be new here. Salty nocoiner. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:03:35
Yeah I know, it's whales trying to get me to sell
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:53:20
Guys I give up. This is going to shit
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:30:25
Fuck you
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:22:40
Anyone think the futures expiration today may be the reason price is being kept at around 9k?
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:21:31
give it a few hours. Recovery is going to be brutal
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:40:51
Silly comment. For every buyer there is a seller...
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:57:17
Oh shut up
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:33:45
True. It's just selling to accumulating whales
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:07:23
Fuck this shit....
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:31:01
Only up from here boys. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:18:26
Haha all replies are bearish. We must be close to a bottom indeed!
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:32:05
You forget that with crypto most ppl will simply not report their holdings (google it, there's research on this specific point). This makes it different than the dotcom.
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:33:16
All this bot buying looks like whales accumulating to me. I think we'll have to await to around Consensus before they finally let it go up
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:18:51
It's time for fomo
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:05:55
Mods can you please stop these fake accounts 
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:50:22
The other dips were far easier to handle as they were quick to recover. This endless slow bleed is getting the better of me I must admit
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:16:19
GDAX action has been the same for weeks now. All these bot walls of around 30 btc showing up on one side and other walls dissappearing with the price then moving a bit and then some other walls pop up. It all looks so fabricated. Honestly I'm losing faith that we"ll recover from this. Have been in since 2014 but am thinking about selling. I guess we must be close to a bottom then I hope.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:24:09
This comment makes no sense. You're mixing up buyer and seller. Also look at the volume. Glad you sold.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:08:19
When do these futures expire?
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:50:44
Same here. Will go down with the ship if I have to
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:18:03
Yet you claim to know that other comments are unfounded... I can only laugh. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:29:11
It is. 10k by end of Sunday. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:38:51
Upvoted cuz true
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:00:09
Nice fud attempt
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:15:22
@_date: 2018-07-29 17:16:46
You don't seriously believe this nonsense do you? Crap systems like this have been scientifically proven not to work. Bankers use it only to lure in suckers with the promise of being able to predict the future. So why bother us with it? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:18:08
Yet you claim to know that other comments are unfounded... I can only laugh. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:35:19
Fuck this shit. I'm done.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:20:11
FOMO bitches
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:45:43
Don't forget to delete your post again when it proves wrong again. Fucking idiot.
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:37:17
Haha wrong you fuck
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:14:56
Your prediction is just as stupid as every other price prediction.
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:11:52
When is the etf decision due?
