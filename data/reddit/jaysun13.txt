He could tweet about executive orders on it that could drive the price down even though he is against regulations. Try to drive the price down then a few days later change course and announce full support thus likely driving the price up as his supporters buy it just because he said its good. This triggering the bull run early. 
It’s bitcoin anything could happen

You should add up how much you think he has taken over time and use for triple damages. Line up a new job before this haha

It’s valued at 11.7 billion as I write this. Obviously selling off could tank the price to under 1000 but per coin value is 11.7 billion.

Of course he did. He’s the inventor

If you think about it PayPal was / a form of virtual currency. At least it was for me at a young age to transfer $ around. He then sold it and likely hated what became of PayPal and bitcoin is his new invention but to not cause a circus he did it anonymously. Who else could let 10-20 billion sit in an account and cash out 0?

Was at  he bank when a man from Thailand was trying to receive a wire from Thailand and was told it would take 3-7 days to process. 3-7 is such a random and annoying thing to be told. Almost seems like magic. Wish I could have told him, “if you do bitcoin it will take 10 minutes”

Elon Musk is Satoshi Nakamoto. Change my mind.

Dump all my $ into amazon and apple and short leman brothers. Take my profit and buy up bitcoin in 2009.
@_date: 2019-02-12 07:09:10
If that were the case miners would be setting up sell walls over 4k and sell pressure would ease up 
@_date: 2019-02-20 08:44:49
Elon Musk probably low key invented bitcoin. My reason behind this theory is he hates what became of PayPal after he sold it.

So basically $ is fake and everyone just owes everyone and they just expect to die before paying it back?

Word of advice . Replace that bitcoin ASAP. Do whatever you can to replace that bitcoin because when it takes off and hits New all time highs you’ll hate the ring if you don’t replace the bitcoin you spent.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:06:14
Good to hear.

You could always prove the conversion yourself.  If the ride is .07 btc = 26.03 @ 371.53 but I bet they will have $ amount because they accept Bitcoin but I'm sure accept credit and PayPal.
I wish these ride apps would accept cash and then just not charge your CC but require CC go ride l

Hate to be a downer but that bitcoin is not ADA Compliant as the top button or touch area can not be higher than 48 inches. A person in a wheel chair can not use this machine.

I’m mad the model 3 wasn’t ready when bitcoin was 20k I would have bought one and sold my car. Bummer

Company’s sell bitcoin to at least cover costs 
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:00:15
Wow you will seriously regret selling them. You didn’t have the bitcoin last week so why not just pretend like you don’t have them and check in a couple of years. You could honestly be sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars or maybe even a million and you will kill you self knowing you sold out for 30k
@_date: 2016-10-24 05:53:20
i bet you it has happened to 90% of people. I own atm machines. i have seen people do a balance inquiry for 3$ from their bank then take out 20$ from the atm for a 3$ fee and 3$ fee to their bank. 9$ to take out 20.... people are DUMB and thus cant handle these types of fees on their own without help. Just because you might be in the minority doesnt mean a thing. It happens to everyone man.
@_date: 2016-10-22 18:12:53
this has happened to everyone. They should make it federally illegal to charge fee's for not having $ and a fee for over drafting. They should DECLINE if you have no money, not charge you 35+
@_date: 2016-10-24 05:54:46
im too busy and have too many accounts for work and business and personal to keep track of an account under 100$. i want overdraft transactions declined...why is that so hard to ask for.
@_date: 2016-10-28 15:54:44
whats that have to do with anything. Its not right to charge what they charge. What do you not get? The little guy gets screwed every time. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:26:28
Can wait for the headlines to read.
"Bitcoin soars above 5000 to an all time high."
@_date: 2015-11-16 03:00:40
but logical.... bookies should switch over to it instead of dealing with cash. Its just a more secure, more efficient way over the typical cash.

If it can take even 5% of the worldwide gambling market the price would default to 2000$

Too bad he didn’t say Donald Trump would become President during a lot of this. Then more people would believe this post today.

Yes correction. Everything from the same source is sent out. So if you receive 1 bitcoin from one transaction and then send .1 to a friend then remaining .9 gets locked until the .1 confirms so in network conditions like this be sure to pay a priority fee. 
If you receive .5 from 2 difference sources and then send .1 you can still send .5 as it will come from the second translation but the .4 from the first one will be locked until confirmation.
@_date: 2019-05-18 14:06:51
When you send with bitpay it send your whole wallet but everything minus the amount you sent returns at the next block confirmation.
@_date: 2019-05-22 12:44:47
Sorry for your loss but legal action will cost you the same as buying a replacement bitcoin. Yes I know that bitcoin will probably be worth 100k one day but my best advice is buy that bitcoin back anyway you can ASAP.
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:32:21
Would it? Would apps still be as free? Would bitcoin ATMs operate? Would coinbase still be up?
