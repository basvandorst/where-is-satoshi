She is an admitted darknet market drug dealer. That's why the police are on her. She is probably an actual money-launderer. She has definitely broken German law.

The government prosecutes people on what can be prosecuted. Maybe they can't prove that she is a drug dealer. But maybe they have good evidence that she is money laundering and financing criminal activities in violation of banking laws. So they will prosecute her for that.
  
Al Capone did not go to prison for the murders he ordered or the criminal enterprise he ruthlessly ran. He went to prison for the provable crime of tax evasion. They could show convincing financial evidence in court. They didn't have good evidence of his other far-greater crimes.
  
I'm opposed to the war on drugs. I think it is wrong that they are nailing her on this because, presumably, this is all they can prove. But that's the system we live in. That's the shit she stepped in.

I ran realsony through snoopsnoo.com. She is an admitted darkmarkets drug dealer. She is committing real serious crimes. I think that those 'crimes' should be legal, but the German government disagrees with me.
  
German police say that she is a money launderer and financing criminal enterprises? *They are right.*
  


  
How smart you are. How foolish realsony for posting this. I assume that the German police will be reading this thread.
  
My heart is with her. I hope she weathers this without going to prison. I wish she would wise up and stop incriminating herself on reddit.
