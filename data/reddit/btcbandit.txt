Someone is going to steal your bitcoin. So do something about it and dont use the same username on different sites.

Whoooo!!!! I just sent some money to my steam account using Bitcoin!
How easy was that no fannying around with Paypal any more!
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:25:25
Recovery plans?? Its a bit late for that isnt it? Perhaps security plans might have been a better idea.
@_date: 2016-04-26 07:59:41
Well i just tried in the UK and unfortunately I cant use Bitcoin on my Steam account :(
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:21:59
 
They seem to send lots of reminders but nothing else :)
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:02:56
Ah OK but what is the expression, a watched kettle never boils. I find if you look away it goes vertical ;)
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:16:10
I made a post a while back about a friend of mines business wanting to take bitcoin.
If you are in business why wouldn't you? They never did set up a merchant account with anyone preferring just to do it face to face anyhow as its not the kind of business that can post its product (its a flight simulator)
Good luck with it all though.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:59:45
And so you check it one day and it's all gone, what then? What does checking it every week do to enhance security?

Not at all, I don't trust Bcash, it's centralised, no other reason. I can use Litecoin if I want fast transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:53:46
Oh right so people arent using Bitcoin then? I must be mistaken, I though I had been using it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:02:48
Andreas is the real Bitcoin Jesus, or maybe the real Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:36:36
Fuck me, no wonder Bitcoin is fucked at the moment. Some people should just stick to using cheques ;)
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:23:29
To be fair i think all exchanges are bogged down. No one can cope with the amount of interest bitcoin is generating.
Its early days yet. The problem is poor experience is putting new users off and also frustrating old users.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:39:10
Tell them then, but dont stick with teh cocks at coinbase. They are just fucking us all over.
@_date: 2018-09-17 08:41:53
Maybe Bitcoin is using more power than is ideal, however didn't everything use more energy than it does now? Cars, light bulbs, computers  etc. It will perhaps get more efficient and if it replaces the joke money that banks and governments push around then it has to be a good thing.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:01:13
Is that Roger very in the background :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:22:27
Just buy a bigger garage thats 'problem' 1 solved
2, you wont need to work
3, whats a meme?
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:40:57
This is a lame excuse. Coinbase are one of the reasons there are high transaction fees. Leave coinabase and manually send your payments for now. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:37:34
She never charged me
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:54:48
Dont use exchanges that dont use segwit, dont use wallets that dont use segwit use RBF etc and you dont have to pay the high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:21:00
Just stop using the lame fuckers. ive emailed Blockchain.info and asked them what I need to do to close my account. I refuse to entertain anyone who has anything to do with Bcash ... BCASH  BCASH BCASH BCASH fuck you Roger

..  sorry the other day.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:27:16
Roger doesn't have a penis, he didn't need one in prison he just bent over and took it.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:21:04
What I want to know is what happens to the bitcoins I hold now if there is a fork and I do nothing with my wallet? Will I personally lose anything?
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:13:21
prison :(
@_date: 2015-12-05 12:55:15
No sorry I'm in a hotel it's on the bbc click program so it might be viewable online somehow.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:32:25

@_date: 2018-08-15 04:24:40
So you are all bitter and twisted because you sold the Bitcoin you bought?
If you didn't then you still own bitcoin so no problem, it will go back up.
@_date: 2018-08-15 09:55:04
Well in that case you best sell it hadn't you??? If you know it's going down you best get out before it goes further.
Some people just aren't ready for Bitcon.
@_date: 2018-08-15 04:34:06
based on what?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:51:01
I used bitcoin to buy a PC and a VR headset, a 1080ti for another pc, worked just fine for me.
@_date: 2014-10-22 13:22:01
What do you sell?
@_date: 2014-10-15 22:17:50
Where can I buy one of these in Europe?
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:00:55
Is there a maximum size the blockchain will grow to or is it just going to keep getting bigger and bigger?
All this is sounding a little worrying! :/
@_date: 2014-07-21 18:31:35
If everyone had your attitude your bitcoin balance would be worth nothing. It's a currency and should be used as such, then everyone will benefit, tight git!
@_date: 2014-02-08 11:04:12
There is no evidence that Gox has anything other than technical issues, sure lots of rumors but no evidence.
All I hear is a load of whingers and whiners who are probably over invested filling their pants that they are going to lose their money.
If Gox has / does fail I will lose money too but I prefer to remain calm and see what the official outcome is. We have been there before with Gox and it will happen again perhaps with other exchanges.
If you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen!
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:01:20
Ah! But can you buy the coke with your credit card ;) 
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:58:36
I have a leased line and a couple of idle servers, however, bandwidth and electricity is expensive.
I think we need an incentive, personally i have a tiny amount of Bitcoin, shouldn't those with the most to lose be putting their hand in their pockets? Maybe they are in which case ignore this :)
If I could make a little from running nodes like miners do then I'm all for it.

Buy using bitcoin then just buy some more coin, simple. That way your bitcoin will become worth more faster than if you all just sit on it.

I'm probably wrong, but, having imported small batches of items from some of China's very small manufacturers some years back I know what a pain dealing with 2 or 3 currencies is. I just think these small manufacturers would prefer to use bitcoin and if it goes mainstream not accepting it will be a setback if the competition is taking it.
If bitcoin has a mainstream future China will need to be part of it as they are a massive exporter.
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:01:23
How is it not related to bitcoin?? Are you on drugs?
What do Exchanges do? They provide an entry point for people to change fiat into BTC? They don't wash cars or sell underwear do they? I wasn't trading on Gox I bought BTC, I tried to withdraw it.
Perhaps your right, exchanges have nothing to do with BTC, lets just shut up about it and let others make the same 'mistake'.
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:11:17
I watched the video or at least the very first bit of it and it worries me when someone who isn't 21 yet says his background is in start-ups, how can he have any experience if he has been to college too? Does this mean his other startups have all failed?
I would prefer to deal with someone a little bit with a little bit more credibility, nice looking website, but as we all know that means nothing.
If they are genuine though good luck to them. The more the merrier so long as they are reliable.
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:03:34
I'm sure I will be corrected here but I cant see a 100% safe way to get into Bitcoin. You send money to an exchange you can get shafted (Gox), you try mining you get shafted buying equipment (Butterly Labs).
The way I do it is little and often to reduce my exposure to rogue exchanges. Dont leave money online and the sad fact: don't trust ANYONE!
@_date: 2014-05-03 16:50:55
...barely human though eh?
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:29:08
The very sad truth is all of this could be avoided IF MTGOX would just come clean and make an honest statement as to what is actually happening.
Then everyone could take fresh look and make their decisions rather than trying to second guess what the situation really is, although I think most of us probably guess right :/
I have a very small amount with them that I had bought and I was not intending to store it there.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:12:21
Did you mean following the nerd? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:52:58
So Gox or any other exchange ripping people off for millions isn't important news?
Get real you smug twat LOL
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:19:16
noun: news
newly received or noteworthy information, especially about recent events.
All the techy stuff is great, if you understand it, you could hang out at Github maybe and join in the chat there?
People are emotional about losing money and worried. It is the biggest thing affecting the future of Bitcoin right now, for Joe Public and potential new users.
Anyhow we aren't going to agree, Ill get back to looking for a glimmer of hope you can get back to doing whatever it is you do.
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:14:28
No need to worry as long as its not yours ;)

@_date: 2014-07-23 16:51:15
Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency. If more people actually use it then it might become more valuable as there are a limited amount of coins. If it isnt used then it is useless. we need people to want Bitcoin, for it to be usefull to the masses. Trust me on this.
@_date: 2014-04-29 21:37:23
Since Gox took my trousers down I've used Kraken. So far so good.

I dont really care if it is temporary, the fact of the matter is I cant spend my BTC right now. What if I had just taken someones girlfriend out to dinner and was trying to impress her.
I get my phone out to pay and guess what, I cant, but its OK I guess I still have a credit card so good old fiat saves the day!
Seriously though this lot needs to be sorted out. Blockchain.info going off line just isnt acceptable, these guys are supposed to have some of the 'best' working for them.
Bitcoin is never going to be taken seriously if crap like this keeps going on, there is no wonder the price has been on a slide for the last few days.
I want to believe but I find it harder with ever fuckup.
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:08:36
I just logged on to see the price heading south. Its triggered all my auto buy trades :) Wished I had hung on a little bit longer and bought some more.
What has caused this? Not more 'bad news' surely?

great video thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-15 10:23:19

@_date: 2016-06-22 14:00:31
So it alters every 2 weeks regardless or is it based on blocks mined? I got it in my head it was the latter I shall go off and try and find the answer.
My original concern was if suddenly half the miners went off line it would take a long time for the difficulty to re-adjust.
@_date: 2016-06-22 16:51:38
Thanks for the clarification 
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:15:38
You're right! I don't know how I missed that!
So I'm going to go long in my shorts and expect a rise in the early morning.
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:13:24
You didn't read my question, I was asking about what effect price will have on mining after halving.
Do I sound surprised?
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:26:16
I just sold all of my BTC before I got to the bottom of this post
@_date: 2016-06-23 18:02:04
Are you sure that is a head and shoulders low and not the inverse plumb conditioner?
I can see the triangle breakout possibly but surely the rhythm section will all have to congregate to support the triangle with thumb symbols and maybe some inverse tamborine play?
 
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:52:45
Ill be turning my miners off if the price doesn't rise, as will many other small miners who have to work out if they can afford their electric bills.
What I mine wont affect anything, but my bills are small. 
Just my thoughts.

@_date: 2017-11-11 17:18:34
Maybe you should give your money to new ICO's? Bitcoin is beta, it carries risks. If you just want security and that cozy feeling maybe invest your money somewhere you will be looked after and pampered.
Dont expect Bitcoin to change just to make you rich. That isnt why it was created. Although these days im starting to wonder what it is about TBH. :)
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:28:17
I watch all the kiddies panic and sell when they get scared when there is a dip then immediately regret it when it goes back up.
If you are so scared of losing them you can't afford to be invested. If you believe in Bitcoin just sit tight. Stop trying to trade. Go watch TV,read a book or better still get a life go outside and enjoy yourself. Try talking to humans face to face.

I think the guy giving the hash for Hello! got it wrong but then maybe it was me ... more likely ;)
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:14:27
Is there anyone reading this here supports the idea of the split?
I cant see one good reason for it other than a few big companies getting richer.
Or am I missing the point? For me its the tried and tested  Bitcoin.

I bet you bought high last time and then panicked and sold didnt you?
Each to their own. Ive been buying and mining since 2013 and the only regret I have is I sold some and I never bought more.
@_date: 2016-09-20 22:31:32
Hope it works, mine never did properly, letters get jammed.
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:12:33
crashed again :)
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:06:36
Who gives a toss? It would be good to see the bulk of mining done elsewhere, although I guess they will work out a way around the ban.

the price has gone up 500 Euro whilst I have been getting fucked up the arse by Kraken. Im going to punch someone
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:13:23
You shouldn't buy more than you can afford to lose. If you did this you can relax in the knowledge that you hold some Bitcoin no matter what the value.
One day you may be rich, one day you may not either way if you sell it now you never will be. Unless you sell and hope it goes lower before buying back in.
You pay your money you make your choice.
I lose interest when the market is like this, then in a few months I will check and see what its worth.

I cant buy back in FFS this is so friggin annoying. Whats a better exchange that is designed to be used?
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:01:20
Well one thing for sure its no one who is using Kraken.com to trade because they are running their exchange on a raspberrypi and a 14k modem. Bunch of fuckwitts!

The thing is I trade Bitcoin and Euros, what are you trading on other platforms?
Being Goxed in the past I am nervous leaving anything on an exchange. At the end of the day I remove everything.

Whilst you are cheating on your wife with your money I hope she has been sneaking out and having a little bit of kissing and hodling with the milkman whilst you are out at the ATM.

Are you sleeping with the CEO then because it seems the majority of users (myself included) struggled to get their orders in. I think it cost me about 800 euro.

In that case you should be happy and rich
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:51:32
Most bitcoin holders are fat nerds who live sat in front of a pc monitor. Probably not going to sell many here.

Unfortunately for you it is the midlands  and its a fixed base 737 simulator not an actual aircraft although they may be partnering with a normal flight school too.
I think ease of converting Bitcoin to pounds at (or near to) the time of purchase would be an important factor due to the volatility of Bitcoin. That said they seem quite keen to also use Bircoin too so fingers crossed they will get some in! :)
Thanks again 
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:59:24
Slightly off topic but I asked the question on bitcointalk a year or more back: would it be possible to spend bitcoin on an aircraft in flight like you can use your credit card?
I know some airlines have internet via satellite but would it be useable with a slow transaction time etc?
Just thinking :)
Dont think I got any kind of real answer after asking.

Looks like a rasberry pi? I have a couple of these one has been used for a couple of years for running miners, (now retired). Could I not just use this old Pi as a node with a hard drive? If so let me know where to get the info
 to do it and I will run it.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:49:51
Has Andreas Antonopoulos commented yet?
Rightly or wrongly he is possibly the one person I trust in the Bitcoin space. If he says its proof then I will be happy until then Im sceptical!

It has cost me no more than paying with cash.

"To put things in perspective, a 30,000 contract holder was margin called trying to go long on 5/18 at about $435"

Not better, different. I use Amazon prime if I need stuff next day or now I can get it in just a couple of hours. Plus you get the music and video for free with Prime. With Free shipping.
Not that that lot applies to using Purse though.

Wont the pools do that or is it up to every individual miner owner to do something? Ive got a bitmain miner working on a pool.
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:56:20
Maybe they are making them faster now if they are selling more and quality has gone down.
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:40:59
Its slow because it can take hours for someone to get funds. I dont give a toss about card transactions. if someone pays me with card then as long as it is a legitimate sale then the money is in my account instantly. I can spend it.
Im not knocking it as such just saying I am disappointed.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:23:15

When Bitcoin goes down the toilet everything else does too, ETH is falling now too.

I was just checking the price and I have a wallet with about .4 in it. The exact amount I lost on Gox. I consider myself very lucky compared to some. The price increase must hurt some guys, Im sure there would have been a few $ millionaires now.

But was the awesome restaurant awesome first then went shit before maybe getting awesome again in the future?
Bitcoin started out great and then just ground to a halt because too many people are using it, a bit like your restaurant, if its that awesome you are going to have to book a table 3 months in advance which is basically what it feels like waiting for a transaction to get confirmed.
