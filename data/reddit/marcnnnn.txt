Could be normies trying to move their saving out of HK, or at least moving part of it. Everyone are trying to open offshore accounts

It's our chance against tyranny
HKer here

Indeed. I think I can comment that was an execution

Nope. What do you mean by "since always". I have the freedom of speech, freedom of protest and free from the fear of white terror "since always" (since i was born), until CCP tighten its grip in recent years. And we are NOT fighting for independence. We are fighting for autonomy and freedom promised to us, both during the handover and written in the Basic Law (HK's constitution).

Just bitstamp/Kraken starting from 2019...used to use local cryto exchanges. Insane premium

A high school boy was shot in the chest by live ammunition on the national day of  extending their brutal suppression of protest to a next level.  I am not surprised HKers/ mainlanders are trying to pour their money out of CCP's reach. Things have been escalating for months

I do not disagree with your vision, you got that part right on spot.  Autonomy was promised in Sino–British Joint Declaration too. So it's not just China. Anyway, this doesn't stop us from fighting back when it's clear that the promises are just lie. HK is not at the mercy of China. If they want to burn us, they should be ready to burn with us

It's all we HKers are asking for, bringing the tyranny down with us. We are not stupid. HK is just a frontier, an example for the world. If HK falls, they are coming to the rest of the world.

Just checked out the price in localbitcoin...never used it before...the prices are ridiculous

I am sure his next common sense is not to stand up against the biggest tyranny in the 21st century
@_date: 2019-10-02 15:18:30


oh common sense... what a creative way to justify executing a 18 year-old kid in a city without any firearm except law enforcement. Good luck in your free cryto world

HKers used to have the exact same thought. But we are standing up that for our own people and the generations to come. When freedoms are stripped off bit by bit, it will eventually come to a point when it's too late to fight back. Infiltration has been CCP 's best trick. It's the time now

My bad, I thought term "live ammunition" is self-explanatory. Edited. Thanks

non-lethal rounds, baton, warning shot...out of his choices he picked to shoot at point-blank range. That was an execution. The police officer did NOT act in self defense. He ran into the crowd and shot
