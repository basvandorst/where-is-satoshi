This. Also I do think a lot of Altcoins will stay burned because of their competition with bitcoin. Many alts are looking to take Bitcoins place by either trying minor improvements or just being faster. People with strong hands and patience will see alts recover for sure over time, question is how long it will take with this extremely bullish Bitcoin! 
I think altcoins need to offer something unique and more than that being a service, altcoin as a service. So altcoins contributing to Bitcoin and other coins. 
With my believe in Altcoins as a service I invested I a small unknown coin called NAV. The currently are in a far stage of developing polymorph. Enabling anonymous instant exchange of bitcoin and 50+ Altcoins. This is a service unique to the current crypto scene, mixers aren't anonymous as we all know.. Here is the roadmap

It's not so much about which is the most unique. I just want to point out that competing with Bitcoin seems to make no sense. Unique development is required and offering services to Bitcoin.

NAV Coin has not yet activated SegWit. The vote has been locked in through PoS voting over a one week period. Over 95% of yes votes were cast during this period. 
Sunday 21 May SegWit will be activated.

No there was no premine. It started as Summercoin, PoW, Summercoin 2, navajocoin, NAV Coin. 
They named it navajocoin because of the WW2 code talkers, because of the anonymous capability. However that was not fully understood by everyone so they made it simply NAV.

We should aim for mass adoption and stuff.. Not this arrogance and elitism. 
Raspberry Pi is an awesome device. [NAV]( for example enables you to mine, PoS, with just a Pi. Cheap and easy for everyone.

Monero is like next level obfuscation. Obfuscation isn't anonymous.

Consider it done! And yes, very nice explanation!

Some want to be bitcoin 2.0, some look to be a service for bitcoin and other crypto, some just promise a lot and don't bring anything and some have a whole other purpose, for example decentralized computing power.

NAV Coin, they are close to release polymorph. It's a service to do instant anon exchanging. Also they finish their R&amp;D on anon Dapps at the moment. 
Solid development over the last years and growing team.
