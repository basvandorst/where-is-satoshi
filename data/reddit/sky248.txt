I've used it to buy and sell.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:47:12
Huh, only took 3 days for me... but they probably have a lot more people trying to sign now than they did when I signed up in march
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:46:08
I used my RBC card to sign up with them, so that works for sure.

I prefer coffee, black.

So I haven't been following Bitcoin for the past 6-7 months. Has anything noteworthy happened in that time frame?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:48:10
Its really simple. You just click the withdraw button on the dashboard page and it shows you the different options. Most just select direct bank transfer since its free, wait a few days and the money shows up into your account.

Lmao, stop, please.


They would be the minority. And you have to consider who even has the money to buy these places in the first place.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:25:28
Lmao, thought this was serious until I read that Goldman Sachs line.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:39:30
I was gonna say the same lmao
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:01:41


And how will one party prove that it was the pollution specifically of another that resulted in their part of the ocean being polluted? what if both parties don't care and decide to dump? 


I was referring to when you said "keeping garbage from traveling onto certain water areas".


The privatization of international waters doesn't do anything to remotely solve this... .

Heh, $3659 USD on Quadriga.ca
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:04:19
I find it funny how you came to those conclusions. You say something I don't agree with and offering a counter argument is me being arrogant?
And how are my arguments me claiming to predict the future and yours are not? I certainly did claim what I believe would happen if such a scenario took place, the same way you claimed what you believed what would happen.

Wow BTC is at record a record high, and BCH is climbing too lol. Glad I stopped procrastinating and bought some a while back
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:30:46


Key word, land. Land isn't shifting much. The stuff we dump on land isn't going to wash up on a beach halfway across the world.


Dumping in the ocean is a legitimate use of water from a profit making perspective.


That's expensive and not easily done. Actually that sounds impossible.


Prior to WWI did corporations own air? Ofc you could sue them, they didn't own it...

I'm more annoyed by the fact that I can't set my own fees, the lowest one you can choose is way too high...
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:12:30
Quadriga, a Canadian exchange. Also I was gonna sell and then buy back during the dip lol.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:10:16
That doesn't make any sense... that would just allow corporations to buy water they are free to pollute. And not to mention, it would be hard to tie pollution in the oceans to anyone in particular since water is constantly moving.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:39:49
Man, I wish I sold when I was seeing prices for over $4700 last night on my exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:19:52
I don't think we have enough adoption of Bitcoin at the current moment for it to be valuable if the economy takes another big hit.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:29:19
$3200 on Quadriga (Canadian exchange). Actually, seems to have been 1-200 higher than other exchanges I've seen over the past few days
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:03:53
This is why large miners only setup in convenient locations, places where energy is cheap like in countries like China, or parts of Canada. Also colder countries where they can save money on cooling, which is where the majority of the costs come from.
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:17:37
LMAO this is the greatest thing ever
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:28:57
Heh, my sister told me to sell at the high and buy the dip and I did
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:24:35
Did you send the entire amount in your wallet? Because I believe you have to have something left to bump it with.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:00:07
There is a feature in Mycelium where you can bump the fee
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:14:12
Forcing someone to do that just increases the chance that they are caught lol, and you can only withdraw so much from an atm.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:50:59
No, its not at all since those are all easily traceable and can be reversed with a call afterwards to the bank/credit card company. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:54:46
Don't keep all your bitcoin on your phone wallet? Could always keep the bulk of your bitcoin in cold storage.

If governments started taking down the internet there would be an uncontrollable revolt worldwide

Was just about to say, we had like a 3 week long "sale"...
