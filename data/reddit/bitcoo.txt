He does. The animations to explain his "subchains" scaling invention was pretty cool:
But this one was my favorite:

But once you do run BU, don't talk about it too much around here or you'll be banned :)

Adam and the other Core devs are protecting us from centralization risk!  He has the ["Courage to Act"](
**“When the economic well-being of their ~~nation~~ Blockchain demanded a strong and creative response, my colleagues at ~~the Federal Reserve~~ Blockstream, policymakers and staff alike, mustered the moral courage to do what was necessary, often in the face of bitter criticism and condemnation. I am grateful to all of them.” **  -- Dr. Adam Back, CEO Blockstream
He knows that we cannot let the block size be determined by a free-market process because the free market is full of stupid people who will do stupid things.  Instead, we must let Blockstream Core Dev use the block size limit as a policy tool that--combined with their infinite wisdom--will result in the ideal balance* between centralization risk and fee pressure.  
In other words, Bitcoin must be centralized in order to remain decentralized.
*ideal balance = block size that maximizes the profit of Blockstream's off-chain payment solutions.
