Bitcoin isn't a get rich scheme. There's some important shit here. We don't just change fundamentals because you want a moon shot
@_date: 2015-06-20 06:31:49
Enough with this shit.
Shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:15:17


lol...no I'm not. I think keeping the 1MB blocksize is a bad idea.
I just outlined what would likely happen *if* we kept it.

What are your thoughts on [Bitseed]( Is it worth the average joe bitcoin enthusiast picking one up? Is this the kind of help you feel is important?

Here's where he says they're still not using the bitcoin blockchain, despite seeing direct evidence to the contrary.
@_date: 2015-05-07 18:27:25
It's incredible how someone can say that when the vast majority of the planet hasn't even *heard* the word 'bitcoin' before. Let alone the portion that has any real understanding of what bitcoin acutally is...

The blockchain is distributed on computers around the world. There is no "just turning it off" unless you're talking about uninventing electricity.
Think about it this way: when a nude photo of a celebrity hits the internet, hundreds of thousands of people download a copy of that photo onto their computer. How is one supposed to get rid of that photo? Go to every computer that downloaded it?
The blockchain is the same thing. As long as one copy exists, the integrity is still intact.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:41:10
I'm not suggesting anyone do anything. Higher fees will be a result of the block size not increasing. It's a product of supply and demand. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 18:41:01
Intersted to hear your take on the block size limit debate.
@_date: 2015-05-13 03:19:25


Link? I saw the Coindesk article, but the Vimeo link in it was private.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:40:59
Yes, faster and way, way less secure.
@_date: 2015-05-13 02:23:49
I have to admit, this is the most plausible business model prediction I've seen for 21.
This idea of putting miners in household appliances seems pretty hair-brained to me. But who knows, if that is indeed what they're doing, I'm willing to bet they've put in the work to determine if it's realistic or not.
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:36:38
Can you elaborate on what vulnerabilities exist with the secure enclave? I feel like there's this back and forth between people who feel coins should *never* be stored on any piece of connected hardware, and then others argue that exisiting hardware does in fact have options for secure storage.
But when I think about the iPhone, I see (to my knowledge) closed-source hardware. In other words, how do we know the secure enclave is as secure as the documentation describes?
Really appreciate your work on breadwallet - it's what I direct all iPhone users to.

Because we'll reach a point in the not-too-distant future, where the 1MB limit is hit more often. You can only pack so many transactions into a 1MB block, so not only does that limit the amount of transactions/second the network can handle, but it also introduces a market for fees. The higher fee transactions are prioritized by miners and now bitcoin isn't such a low-cost way of moving money.
@_date: 2015-05-11 23:47:17
Yep, I know this.
@_date: 2015-05-13 02:27:26
what's your point?
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:45:27
The hypothesis is that there will come a time where the miners begin making more money from fees than the block reward.
@_date: 2015-05-06 21:40:19
I think we need a TKS-type company based in a neutral country like Iceland.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:46:42
Do you have any peer-reviewed evidence for these claims? 
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:13:04
Calm down.

Pretty decent interview.
They seemed a little more comfortable than in some of their past talks. Good work, guys.
@_date: 2015-05-13 03:05:15
No, I can't.
You're obviously skeptical of 21. That's great. You say...


Learn what exactly? Has 21 somehow under-delivered their not-yet-delivered product/service?
@_date: 2015-05-06 21:44:40


Best of luck.
You're right though. All these idiots who've been working on this stuff all day, everyday for the past 5 years, most with decades of experience in distributed systems, security, and cryptography should just charge ahead and yank the limit because "derrr sumthing else will jUst be bettttrrr"

@_date: 2015-05-11 03:58:19
The thing is, you don't need to.
IMO this is one of the best things about bitcoin: it's a tech that lives or dies by its utility and merit.
If you find it compelling, use it. If you don't, don't.
@_date: 2015-05-05 20:16:39
Sure, but they're already doing that. Where there's a will, there's a way.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:05:41


Well, you can, you'll just be required to pay a higher fee to "reserve" your space in a block.
@_date: 2015-05-07 07:04:45
I'm not sure this is "demanding that any discussion be stopped".
@_date: 2015-05-06 20:25:43


This is absolutely correct. I didn't mean to imply this was the best game theoric approach. Simply stating that, in practice, if someone wanted to get included in a block, they can *effectively* guarantee it.
@_date: 2015-05-06 22:37:07
I assume the software will be open source as well. But maybe that's wrong.
@_date: 2015-05-09 08:27:01
It's most likely because the reddit software insta-downvotes all threads/comments that suck as much dick as this one.
@_date: 2015-05-06 21:37:51
I'm not sure this is the case, but doesn't seem like a stretch. I think in order for this to be rigorous enough, the two companies holding keys (Case and TKS, in this instance) need to be in two different jurisdictions. 
Having both be US-based companies is a weakness.
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:47:01
The [lightning network]( (or something like it), sidechains, and pruning will likely solve the issue with scalability.

It's exciting for the community because it shows further evidence of a talent migration toward bitcoin companies. Why you feel the need to pessimistically qualify the position is more telling about your attitude than anything else.
And who are you to decide what's newsworthy? At what point does it become newsworthy? Once the person's title crosses a certain level? Would a previous VP at Mastercard be newsworthy? Not for you, by the looks of it. It's just too easy to move the goalposts.
"Well, it's just an HR person"
"Well, it's just a middle manager"
"Well, it's just the COO"
"Well, Mastercard isn't even the top payments company. It'll be newsworthy when VISA gets on-board"
If you get to decide what's newsworthy, I get to decide what's comment-worthy, and you don't quite make the cut.

All that for nothing! :)

I'm interested to hear your thoughts on the block size limit debate.
@_date: 2015-05-13 04:31:08
It depends.
If you want long-term offline storage, I'd look into the various hardware wallets ([Trezor]( [Ledger]( [Case](
For daily use, if you have an android-powered smartphone, I'd recommend [Mycelium]( For iOS, I'd recommend [breadwallet](
You can also check out [bitaddress.org]( if you're interested in paper wallets. If you choose this, I'd recommend using an offline computer (old laptop, raspberry pi, etc.) to generate the wallets and preferably a basic, non-wifi USB printer to print them.
Hope this helps!

No no, the idea of controlling the flow of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:59:49
My word, who comes up with this shit?
I can't help but think how often legislation in other areas is proposed/passed with virtually zero education on the topic.
@_date: 2015-05-07 02:40:17
Just because the limit is increased doesn't mean blocks start hitting the new limit all of a sudden.
@_date: 2015-05-11 01:51:38
Aw, what's wrong? Your intention of coming in here and laughing about no real use-cases isn't working out :(

@_date: 2015-05-06 17:22:51


Right. This isn't misalinged with what I said. In general, if you're willing to pay a high enough fee, you'll getincluded.
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:14:20
Good christ, what a shitty comment.
@_date: 2015-05-12 22:42:46

You are mistaken.

Is this that pickup artist book?
If so: 
@_date: 2015-05-15 03:43:57


No, because we don't know what they're doing. And like others have said, provide some link to these financial statments or GTFO.
@_date: 2015-05-17 23:37:29
You want to know why there's no response to this?
Because it's a sound analogy and practically irrefutable.

And yet Gavin doesn't argue this


@_date: 2015-05-06 17:26:56


I think so.


That's not remotely true. As evidenced by Bitcoin currently.


Well, the people who have literally built this system and work on it all day, everyday seem to disagree with you. 
With all due respect, I'll throw in with their camp.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:30:55
You're not actually saying anything here. Of course it's all relative.
If I am willing to pay a 1BTC on a $5 coffee, my txn **will** get included in the next block. Then you say "but what if everyone is willing to pay that fee?" as if that's a reasonable thing to say.

Then how about you drop the self-righteousness about bitcoin not being usable by "normal people" and realize that beggars can't be choosers. I'm a normal person and I use bitcoin. I can also explain bitcoin to other normal people without receiving blank stares.
