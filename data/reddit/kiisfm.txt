@_date: 2015-06-19 06:00:34
More like bfl'd
@_date: 2015-06-21 12:38:18
Are you insane? You think we'll fork without core??
@_date: 2015-06-21 12:36:06
No one's using xt, I'll use core with this patch
@_date: 2015-06-14 02:01:52
It'll work but Bitcoin now does something similar inside
@_date: 2015-06-08 07:06:04
It's a great payment rail
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:57:14
That's a great spread for Brazil
@_date: 2015-06-18 22:41:38
Yes they were part of the paycoin scam
100% scam do not ever do business with them, use bitpay
Gocoin scam fraud

Almost everyone is a scammer to me, I feel like I'm getting scammed until I finally have Bitcoin in my armory safely
@_date: 2015-06-16 09:38:01
Bitcoin only
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:54:24
I just buy no matter the price
@_date: 2015-06-05 16:11:11
I had a node turned off until I got pruning

@_date: 2015-06-03 12:44:28
I'd print them a paper wallet with entropy
@_date: 2015-06-20 05:58:44
Wouldn't they just be behind the network at some point? Mining in the past? 
@_date: 2015-06-15 03:19:06
Use purse
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:24:02
Most have sms

@_date: 2015-06-18 09:32:11
Ok sorry
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:50:36
The change is still centralized and can be changed. The blockchain just provides an unalterable audit
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:33:22
You should be using armory, it has hd backups which never require refreshing
@_date: 2015-06-26 22:02:23
Nothing can beat uncensorable Bitcoin. Govcoin will be even worse than cash with centralized theft with one click by the government. Centralized emoney will have horrific consequences. Gates is leading the poor into a world where their $1 in their shack can be instantly forfeited and sqld to the rich. This is exactly what governments, banks and buttcoiners want. Scum.
@_date: 2015-06-22 12:35:23
She used armory, it might be a random new address from her cold wallet. Her site uses bitpay. I don't see a prominent tip address.

@_date: 2015-06-21 11:04:57
Why no bitpay? 
@_date: 2015-06-21 13:08:40
I have faith core will add it, I won't run xt until it's optional, not expected as you say
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:29:44
That's exactly how it works except everyone should finish a whole copy

Mircea Popescu — One of the most outspoken personalities in the Bitcoin world, Mircea founded MPEx, a trading platform for Bitcoin securities, which made him quite wealthy. He has his good moments such as bailing out OpenBSD and telling the SEC off. However, he looks down on anyone he considers a “Bitcoin noob” and can be quite abrasive in his communications. You can no longer follow him on Twitter at  because his account was banned for “threatening” to kill Andreas Antonopoulos, but he often hangs out on IRC in the  channel.
@_date: 2015-06-01 09:20:19

That blue part doesn't go down, it's tiny and it's only off chain at Coinbase, they can't see other off chain. Like you said, no one can see it unless they talk.
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:14:13
You choose. If you're reported wrong you get banned or something. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 11:51:19

Don't apologize, you just need more versions, bigger smaller etc

@_date: 2015-06-04 04:14:14
So you don't have to download the blockchain
@_date: 2015-06-29 03:49:40
@_date: 2015-06-11 18:09:25
How would you like that to work? 
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:40:15
It's bigger kb
@_date: 2015-06-11 01:07:40
Blockchain does, it's part of their receive api
@_date: 2015-06-26 22:06:17
Yeah what we need is a list of onion nodes, I made one too but no one knows about it, onion isn't shared p2p
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:46:26
Bitcoiners are usually libertarians and very private. If I get rich, I'd disappear off the face of the earth. This account would be closed and I'd be long gone. No one would ever know I had bitcoins. I'd move to Austria to live next to glock and talk to no one.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:25:59
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:48:43
Nodes verify and relay. Can't be stolen because it's hashed and inside is their address where their coins go. To change it requires mining a new block which is better spent on the next block, not working backwards.
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:07:49
Copay is very good
@_date: 2015-06-22 00:34:46
Nah that's dsl fud, I get full 300 almost always. But up is 20 so still shitty
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:38:28
@_date: 2015-06-02 06:50:06
You don't need the public
@_date: 2015-06-27 03:59:55
Why don't you look at the btc sent
@_date: 2015-06-02 12:09:47
Ill wait until it actually has new code
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:56:57
Reddit still has coontown
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:18:12
That's too bad
@_date: 2015-06-21 12:23:51
So if there's a wallet.dat how's it making a new one? 
@_date: 2015-06-14 02:04:47
Sure save the source code and someone can code it for you
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:05:59
Just use Coinbase to receive payments too

No amount doesn't matter. The size is when there's many inputs. Say you get hundreds of Satoshi transactions from a faucet, combining those will be extremely large. Moving millions of dollars would be almost free otoh.

@_date: 2015-06-05 12:53:09
Looks like wallets will currently be disabled
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:29:44
Namecoin is mined by Bitcoin miners. Litecoin is a shitcoin.

Yes this price is definitely natural and any more demand will just go up
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:53:05
That's still centralized. The benefit is the ledger. Banks have lost track of who owns what mortgage as they traded paper back and forth etc
@_date: 2015-06-08 07:16:27
Stripe is pumping stellar like idiots
@_date: 2015-06-07 14:47:28
So no chili dogs? 
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:03:00
That's wrong blocks will stay the same size even with bigger limits for a while
@_date: 2015-06-06 12:07:15
It's extremely overpriced, the point is to trade the contracts
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:07:46
Because it's really old
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:46:20
No it's good for people to find a Bitcoin wallet when searching blockchain
@_date: 2015-06-21 13:06:18

Who cares
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:46:39
It's both, you can not relay or relay but then not have big blocks being mined
@_date: 2015-06-15 02:21:02
No most people would use hosted wallets
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:21:28

Lol now companies are starting to want Bitcoin. Listen lifelock, you got scammed with lemon, it doesn't even do anything. Stop this shit and start your own Bitcoin services before it's too late. Xapo isn't that great anyway and has no income yet. Stop being so stupid.
@_date: 2015-06-14 22:36:44
@_date: 2015-06-02 12:07:44
No they didn't, that's mms gateway spam.
Call your carrier to change your mms email address, tmobile recently had a bunch of spam.
@_date: 2015-06-23 11:41:13

@_date: 2015-06-15 06:36:38

So, I built a credit card enabled version of the site for you! You can find it at  it’s $19.99/month, and it accepts VISA, Mastercard, JCB, and Discover! It’s almost identical to the main site, in that you can access almost my entire catalog of over 300 videos, I’ve just had to remove some of my more super-taboo videos in order to comply with the payment processors moral policies. It makes me sad having to censor myself, but I think it’s worth it if it means you guys will be able to enjoy it! I’ll be updating it in parallel to my main site, so in general all of the content will be identical, just some changes to wording and certain videos will only be available on the bitcoin site. I know it’s not the perfect solution, but now you can enjoy my content even without bitcoin, and make the switch whenever you’re ready! The main site will always be bitcoin only so we’ll be free from censorship and be able to make the porn we want to make! It also always be half the price of the credit card site thanks to Bitcoin’s lack of fees!

Correct these paid shills have a job to do. You can see it clearly in the Engadget xbox article comments.
I respect the mods for not censoring but some of these shills are enemy combatants and no longer have rights as civilians.

You can import and send because you have the private key. A sweep is just an automated way of importing, sending then deleting. Same thing.
You can definitely send internally between addresses. I cycle my bitcoins periodically. Yeah when you buy they normally just send to an address you provide. No need for private keys. Like when you buy something, you send not fund a private key and give it to them. You're thinking of something like physical coins with a hidden key. Those aren't very safe since the key wasn't generated by you.
When choosing am online system make sure you own the keys. Blockchain.info and greenaddress you own them. Coinbase no.
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:21:15
Yup, a great use is for people to spend Bitcoin and never have to hold it, instant buy then send, no fees no markup no volatility no stolen credit cards

I was also banned from buttcoin, they made up that I was selling nudes or something. They're trash and will burn but I like bashco. He's actually a good guy, better than the other mods for sure.
These paid shills have a job to do. You can see it clearly in the Engadget xbox article comments.
I respect the mods for not censoring but some of these shills are enemy combatants and no longer have rights as civilians.
I trust bashes judgement and I think he's not even given the ban permission. Somethings gotta change though. 
I've also been banned from here many times for also being crazy haha

The problem is if you choose a shitcoin, you then compete with Bitcoin and 500 other coins. It's plain stupid. The public barely knows Bitcoin and people think their shitcoin has a chance. If you choose your shitcoin based on technical merits then everyday a better one comes out.

A private key is one address. When you import it then spend, whatever wallet you're using may send the change to an address it normally generates. If you destroy that burner wallet, you'll lose that change.

Infinite addresses can be generated through one root key, it's good for backups since you only need to store the root key. Thats all. Core generates random addresses which need each key backed up.

Sending extra Bitcoin is impossible, leeching is impossible. That was your change which was instantly sent back to you. You didn't lose anything other than your bet. You're very confused and holding a grudge for no reason.
Your change is still sitting here 
Your wallet generates change addresses on the fly  for you. Bitcoin has inputs and outputs, when you use a bigger input, change is generated.
Please forgive Bitcoin as it did not wrong you :(

If you use a paper wallet and say spend it through a software wallet, that wallet will create a change address. If you then destroy the software thinking your change is in the paper wallet, you just lost the new private key which contains your change.

The longest one that's it. Valid transactions should be present in both unless mempool rules differ greatly but most are stock.
Now if you're fee is too low and the winner didn't like it, it may get dropped since other nodes removed it from their mempool or it may come back ready to be mined again. This part I'm not sure about. It's gotta be the second one or double spend attacks would be easy.
Now in an attack he'll insert a new transaction effectively double spending. Standard miners would never allow that because the input would be spent in the mempool and therefore rejected.

The ruble or rouble (/ˈruːbəl/; Russian: рубль; IPA: [rublʲ]) (RUB) is a unit of currency of various countries in Eastern Europe and is closely associated with the economy of Russia. Currently, the currency units of Belarus, Russia, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria, and, in the past, the currency units of several other countries, notably countries influenced by Russia and the Soviet Union, are named rubles, though they all are different currencies. One ruble is divided into 100 kopecks (Russian: копе́йка, tr. kopeyka; IPA: [kɐˈpʲejkə]).

Does this mean that although we can buy the coin at around $4.00, if it is actually worth at least $20.00?
Answer: Yes, Josh stated that the coin will be $4.00 or less for the miners to purchase using their Hashpoints.The analysts and banks have stated that they have determined the coin will be “at least” $20.00 per coin, once it is released for sale to the public.
Clarification (Allen): This is just like an Initial Stock Placement Offer (IPO), to investors and the public, of a corporation’s first issuance stock on the NASDAQ, NYSE, Euronet, CAC 40 and DAX. A company decides to raise a specific amount of money to expand their operations, so they go through a process with investment bankers to secure the needed amount of money. The investment bank analysts probe the would-be investors to get an impression of what value they place on the stock, or in this case, a coin. This will change as the offering date approaches, sometimes higher or sometimes lower. They will know best a day or two before this ICO for the coin. Currently, GAW is being given data to indicate that the coin will go for “at minimum” $20.00 each to investors who have already shown interest to “buy in.”
I am basically curious how you guarantee this $20.00 price. Why $20.00 and $4.00 valuations?
Answer-1: $20.00 is not guaranteed, it is the minimum price that outside investors have agreed they would be willing to pay to invest in the coin. It is highly likely the coins market value, at sale time, will be higher than the $20.00 price. As the ICO date approaches, more valuations will be determined from further probing of the interested investor market.
Answer-2 (Allen): All of the ICO coins are apportioned based on the current investors’ and banks’ percentage of involvement up to this point. The remaining share of the ICO coins belong to GAW (and entities). This is a funding coin for GAW’s business expansion projects as well. All involved entities have decided on the percentage of the ICO that will be sold to the miners. Any miner with Hashpoints will be able to purchase the coin with their Hashpoints.
Prime owners also will have a continued role in the workings of the coin in the future. Therefore, it was agreed that the miners would be able to buy-in at the lower price, but that the coins would not be just given away without a reasonable value paid. Therefore, the value of $4.00 “or less” was decided, based on the number of Hashpoints estimated to be mined by the ICO date. As we approach the ICO date, that number will be solidified for the miners based on the total number of Hashpoints that have been mined by the date of the ICO.
So, that means every Hashpoint is worth $0.05?
Answer: No. They are currently worth $0.01. Since our miners will be able to purchase the coin at or below $4.00 (400 Hashpoints), the conversion will be based on a Hashpoint being worth $0.01 each. However, miners will have an immediate appreciation of value for the coins they buy based on the ICO’s success. If the end price is $20.00 per coin for investors, then our miners will have earned prospectively 400% (or more) on their investment in each coin they have purchased with Hashpoints, once the initial offering has completed.
This is my concern. How do we ensure we get in?
Answer: It has already been arranged with the underwriting bank(s) and investors. All totaled Hashpoints represent a share of the entire pool of coins offered. Those miners who do not participate by purchasing the coin with their Hashpoints, will only be able to acquire the coin in the future through exchanges, or by mining the coin with Primes. Some miners may not want to use their Hashpoints to buy the coin, choosing instead to use their points to purchase AMPs for their Hashlets in the future.

Maybe my original reason for being ignored was wrong. But don't lie and say you weren't busy with anything else, like covering things up from your partners.
@_date: 2014-09-14 11:57:54
You're pretty good at this already. The trick to the ledger/blockchain is the proof of work PoW which requires extreme amounts of power to generate a block. The entire network barely keeps up due to difficulty rising, there's no way to go back and change older blocks and catch up. This is where a hypothetical 51% attack can happen because due to "voting" they can possibly rewrite a couple previous blocks and catch up in time rewriting a couple blocks. This is useful say when you want to buy a house, show them confirmations then get your bitcoin back by rewriting the transaction to yourself. Pools are made up of many miners but because it's centralized, a hack can redirect the work. This isn't invisible and would be detected, probably resulting in a fork and ignoring the bad blocks. Anyway it's not a concern.
A wallet is just private keys correct. There are no bitcoins in it. The keys let you move bitcoin, you never own bitcoin though. You only have the right to move it. If someone gets your private key, they too can move it to an address where you can't move it back. Some people get worried about someone creating the same private key, but there's more keys than atoms on earth or something like that. The coolest thing is that you can generate a key offline and receive bitcoin without ever "registering" your address to the network.
Different wallets behave differently. QT is always creating 100 keys ahead. A potential issue is if you don't backup, do 100 transactions then have to recover. Well your backup won't have your latest key. Newer wallets are deterministic where they can create unlimited keys from one master key. You back it up once and forget about it.
Yes there are light wallets which ask a server for balanaces and inputs. Every wallet exports keys differently. In QT go to the console and export the key 
Blockchain.info saves a txt file usually encrypted. It's important to always have backups from whatever wallet. Blockchain can create new keys on the fly so backing up everytime is critical. Change addresses are a good concept to understand. QT generates them always when your input to spend is less than your output, it creates a new address to receive it (tho many keys are pregenerated as earlier). Blockchain likes to reuse addresses, possibly because people don't like to backup every time since they don't have a key pool. Armory wallet is deterministic and one backip can recover forever. Tho when you recover, it may not generate enough to get to the end of your activity, you simply tell it to make more from your master key.
Electrum seed is deterministic and can generate forever. Different wallets have different formats, just backup a lot and you can move by recovering, they all allow key export and import though it's not recommended. You should recover, then send to new wallet.
You shouldn't move your addresses between wallets. Send bitcoin over the network. Though in emergencies you can export and import keys. Blockchain.info even lets you drag and drop your wallet.dat great in case you have bitcoin and haven't syned in a while. Upload the file and get instant access. The server pulls out the private keys. Though it's recommended to then use new keys from Blockchain.
You can import keys and files between computers but it's not recommended. You should use seperate files or they might get confused as to why there's transactions when it never sent them. For a daily hot wallet, something like desktop Blockchian site and mobile app is great.
Localbitcoins usually don't give you keys. They just send over the network. IF you ever do get a key, you should never import it. Sweep instead which will create a transaction into your other address. If you simply import, the other guy obvioualy has the key still and can take them back. Sweeping is what you mean and some wallets provide that functionality.
If you are using QT, I highly recommend using Armory. QT is still required but armory has many more features and is deterministic. Armory talks to the local QT to get data. It's highly secure and no servers to ask. Armory is a seperate wallet so you will have to go into QT and send to your new Armory wallet.

Snapsaved claims that it took the site offline as soon as it realized that it had been hacked. Users appear to have believed that Snapsaved let them save their Snapchat photos on their own devices; they didn't know that the pictures were also being saved on servers owned by Snapsaved. There is no evidence that Snapsaved had attempted to alert users of the site that their saved Snapchat photos and videos had leaked. Instead, the snapsaved.com URL was changed to redirect to a shopping website.

"Gawsome! 
All these rumours and negativity projected towards Paycoin and  only do one thing for me: Convince me to invest more in GAW because this perpetual jealousy usually means a good thing for our community, they see a real threat :D
Pulls out pocketbook
Like I said, the jealousy spewing from the acne on the kids face, that wrote the article is only making me invest more of my time and money into Paycoin.
Pulls out pocketbook again"

Op, I've been in your shoes at pyramining, people were begging to get scammed. The company attacks you and the delusional supporters hang you until the last second, then they blame YOU. it's sad but I've learned people like to get scammed and they get mad at you if you try to stop it.
But it hurts Bitcoin and there's nothing you can do. This is why we need the death penalty for financial crimes, especially now that they can hide it in Bitcoin. Can't take their Bitcoin but you can take their life. Bfl, knc, gaw, neobee.

jmordica's Mining Statement: 
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:46:29
People keep calling what Luke did blacklisting but it's just filtering transactions from being relayed on your own node. Your node will still accept them if they get mined. It's already being done by miners. Some don't want to relay or mine sdice. But they'll still accept blocks
with them.
True blacklisting rejects those blocks and that's a dangerous precedent.
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:21:34

An ambassador is an official envoy, especially a highest ranking diplomat who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state, or to an international organization as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment.[1] The word is also often used more liberally for persons who are known, without national appointment, to represent certain professions, activities and fields of endeavor.

I truly believed the ny hearings were about how to ban Bitcoin, as an early user we went through a lot and I did lose faith but finally promised myself to never lose faith again. Now I'm all in no matter the price.

True but that's when you sell nonrefundable bulk packs. Like 100 at a time. Enough to show commitment but low enough to not let them get more if there's a problem. This all happens automatically in the store. Problem is they must expand and brand rapidly. Especially now they've proved their product.

Millennials want digital money not stupid metal.
But there are other reasons that Silbert believes that the price is going to rise. He took a quick survey of the room, asking how many people were under 40. Many raised their hands. He then asked how many owned gold. Very few of those under 40s raised their hands. He finally asked how many planned on buying bitcoin. Many did.
Silbert’s point was that much of the money that is currently being held in gold will transition to bitcoin as younger people gain access to it. And that increase in demand will force the price of bitcoin up. “If the $7 trillion gold business moves to bitcoin as a store of value, there is a lot of potential,” Silbert said.

Does this mean that although we can buy the coin at around $4.00, if it is actually worth at least $20.00?
Answer: Yes, Josh stated that the coin will be $4.00 or less for the miners to purchase using their Hashpoints.The analysts and banks have stated that they have determined the coin will be “at least” $20.00 per coin, once it is released for sale to the public.
Clarification (Allen): This is just like an Initial Stock Placement Offer (IPO), to investors and the public, of a corporation’s first issuance stock on the NASDAQ, NYSE, Euronet, CAC 40 and DAX. A company decides to raise a specific amount of money to expand their operations, so they go through a process with investment bankers to secure the needed amount of money. The investment bank analysts probe the would-be investors to get an impression of what value they place on the stock, or in this case, a coin. This will change as the offering date approaches, sometimes higher or sometimes lower. They will know best a day or two before this ICO for the coin. Currently, GAW is being given data to indicate that the coin will go for “at minimum” $20.00 each to investors who have already shown interest to “buy in.”
I am basically curious how you guarantee this $20.00 price. Why $20.00 and $4.00 valuations?
Answer-1: $20.00 is not guaranteed, it is the minimum price that outside investors have agreed they would be willing to pay to invest in the coin. It is highly likely the coins market value, at sale time, will be higher than the $20.00 price. As the ICO date approaches, more valuations will be determined from further probing of the interested investor market.
Answer-2 (Allen): All of the ICO coins are apportioned based on the current investors’ and banks’ percentage of involvement up to this point. The remaining share of the ICO coins belong to GAW (and entities). This is a funding coin for GAW’s business expansion projects as well. All involved entities have decided on the percentage of the ICO that will be sold to the miners. Any miner with Hashpoints will be able to purchase the coin with their Hashpoints.
Prime owners also will have a continued role in the workings of the coin in the future. Therefore, it was agreed that the miners would be able to buy-in at the lower price, but that the coins would not be just given away without a reasonable value paid. Therefore, the value of $4.00 “or less” was decided, based on the number of Hashpoints estimated to be mined by the ICO date. As we approach the ICO date, that number will be solidified for the miners based on the total number of Hashpoints that have been mined by the date of the ICO.
So, that means every Hashpoint is worth $0.05?
Answer: No. They are currently worth $0.01. Since our miners will be able to purchase the coin at or below $4.00 (400 Hashpoints), the conversion will be based on a Hashpoint being worth $0.01 each. However, miners will have an immediate appreciation of value for the coins they buy based on the ICO’s success. If the end price is $20.00 per coin for investors, then our miners will have earned prospectively 400% (or more) on their investment in each coin they have purchased with Hashpoints, once the initial offering has completed.
This is my concern. How do we ensure we get in?
Answer: It has already been arranged with the underwriting bank(s) and investors. All totaled Hashpoints represent a share of the entire pool of coins offered. Those miners who do not participate by purchasing the coin with their Hashpoints, will only be able to acquire the coin in the future through exchanges, or by mining the coin with Primes. Some miners may not want to use their Hashpoints to buy the coin, choosing instead to use their points to purchase AMPs for their Hashlets in the future.

I need agents! Right now when someone calls, they'll be forwarded to an agent. Both your number and theirs is private. I can't currently control when calls come in so you have to manually tell me when to add you or remove you.
Then I need people to call in needing help! I have many features for the future. Eg. For both agents and callers to call and take calls in their browser. i need programmers and donations for more twilio minutes!
I'd like to pass out cards, get grants, develop premium support for companies looking to outsource support using our best agents.

Millennials want digital money not stupid metal.
But there are other reasons that Silbert believes that the price is going to rise. He took a quick survey of the room, asking how many people were under 40. Many raised their hands. He then asked how many owned gold. Very few of those under 40s raised their hands. He finally asked how many planned on buying bitcoin. Many did.
Silbert’s point was that much of the money that is currently being held in gold will transition to bitcoin as younger people gain access to it. And that increase in demand will force the price of bitcoin up. “If the $7 trillion gold business moves to bitcoin as a store of value, there is a lot of potential,” Silbert said.

They very clearly state that their insurance applies to "online" assets only - or about 3% of the bitcoins they store on behalf of users.  Everything that remains offline is uninsured.  In other words, even if Coinbase's cold storage assets are "safer", they aren't actually covered.

Also get an invite to circle.com which is free. Coinbase charges 1%. Bitcoin is divisible to 100 million units so you can buy 0.000045 if you want. We like to use Bits which are 100 of these units called satoshis. 100 million satoshis in a Bitcoin, 1 million bits. Pm me anytime in the future if you want help. Yes you give them a public address to send to. But Coinbase is also a wallet but you should look into running your own. Then send from Coinbase to your own.

Bitinstant was awesome I never complained about that. I'm mad you went after other profits instead of staying with bitinstamt which was awesome for Bitcoin. I had to spend weeks yelling at that zipzap company to get a refund.
I just want people here to know what's really going on then make a decision. Until now many thought you were in trouble for bitinstsnt. I don't believe you closed that just because and nothing to do with your involvement in silkroad.
No I'm not jealous of you, I don't need to buy a bar to be cool. You're still immature.
People here just need to know the truth. You need to stop lying. You're still trying to twist things by focusing on bitinstant and what you did which was great. But you're hiding btcking and silk road. You took a plea, admit what really happened and tell us about the future.

For thine is the Blockchain, the Power, and the Glory
For ever and ever.

No it's what you sold it for then when you sell for fiat. I guess if you never mentioned a fiat price then yeah the basis is when you got it. Stick to one, if you start choosing the best method that benefits you on every sale then you're in trouble. Just keep logs and a procedure.

Who cares
@_date: 2014-09-01 08:25:41
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:59:59
Yeah it's dumb
With selfish mining, the attacker keeps the block to itself and mines on top of it without exposing it to the network. [The selfish miner] only exposes this secret chain — the local secret chain — when it has to in order to maximize its revenue. It turns out by doing that a miner can actually increase its revenue and earn more than it should, more than its fair share of the mining power, and this is the essence of the attack.

Centralization is only increasing because less people are using core. This will continue whether blocks are increased or not. 
I run a few nodes and I could care less what the block size is. I need pruning already and changing the size doesn't matter one bit, I have one large node ready with a 3tb disk, FILL ME UP ASSHOLE. 21mb sounds great, I'm ready. 
You wrote a bunch of crazy shit but never explained how centralization will increase. Less nodes? People running nodes now will continue because it's a hobby for us. The nodes aren't wallets anymore.

@_date: 2015-05-04 08:34:52
Wait until your keypool diverges and you lose coins
@_date: 2015-05-03 12:33:54
Try them backwards! 
@_date: 2014-11-23 18:08:05
I'm ready for you fucker
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:26:41
Blast of education
@_date: 2014-10-13 16:34:24
Idiot you didn't learn anything
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:00:59
Tell us how creepy olaf was
@_date: 2015-05-01 11:45:54
Privacy is a suspicious transaction.

I love armory
@_date: 2014-12-31 08:47:33

Lol Litecoin is a shitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-17 12:43:48
I hear blah blah blah, give me Bitcoin take my shitcoin
@_date: 2015-05-21 15:40:48
Any live leak? 
@_date: 2015-05-16 11:18:41
They don't, we switch to Bitcoin citadels
It's all outlined at @_date: 2014-10-11 00:07:16
Sounds like you're one of them
@_date: 2014-12-18 01:12:00
It's making 1mb every 10 minutes
@_date: 2014-09-04 02:06:51
Death to Litecoin
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:15:12
Yup better than mark, hackers, or court
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:24:58
It won't be cold anymore. Migrate to new wallet, send change to new address.
@_date: 2015-05-11 20:29:31
That interest is a huge red flag
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:15:24
Not a single miner will risk losing even one block, everyone will switch
@_date: 2015-05-04 02:53:12
You just can't use it at the same time on different computers
@_date: 2015-05-06 11:36:37
Why no meerkat? Wtf is pundit
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:43:42
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:29:55
I can put the Trezor in my mouth, this one I cannot
@_date: 2015-01-19 15:37:50
Oh lol! 
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:02:15
Still pretty safe, it's obviously not a wallet
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:03:35
Yup this guy is now running his own scam
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:14:12
I hated having my gold after a while. I never thought I'd get ask, let alone get paid in Bitcoin the next day. Finally divested personally of gold thanks to amagi.
@_date: 2014-09-08 03:49:38
Blame the criminals at Apple, low life scum
@_date: 2015-05-03 03:23:31
Haha shitcoins
@_date: 2015-05-06 13:18:03
What's that have to do with block size? 
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:17:04
@_date: 2015-05-03 04:15:38
Shamir can be used per key before multi sig
@_date: 2014-08-31 19:37:33
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:09:44
I wasted my time looking for a photo Yuck
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:46:32
Fully agree
@_date: 2015-01-17 21:23:02
It could but it's barely dropped off at all if not increased
@_date: 2015-01-08 05:07:00
Yah but it's expensive
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:11:26
None of that matters, where's the orgasm? 
@_date: 2015-01-25 03:16:32
They're good but you never keep Bitcoin on any exchange
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:17:38
Like Intel? 
@_date: 2015-01-17 21:20:13
A quad core in my pocket is ridiculous, I'd be stoned to death 10 years ago
@_date: 2015-05-24 17:03:28
There goes your throw away
@_date: 2014-10-09 09:26:40
Well that's dumb, keep checkpoints just for piece of mind
@_date: 2014-10-17 22:14:35
@_date: 2015-01-27 07:40:00
Please guys, don't get scammed, just use rushwallet for your online needs
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:14:11
I use authenticator plus, amazing app
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:52:09
This can't be real
@_date: 2015-01-01 06:15:25
How's it feel to be a trail blazer? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:29:49
That should be it
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:24:34
Please don't add alt coins, it dilutes the experience and there's thousands you'll have to add.
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:39:41
Banker shills getting desperate
@_date: 2015-01-30 06:12:36
Wanna trade some shitcoins? 
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:18:42
Current situation shows current laws work.
@_date: 2015-01-26 09:42:31
Enjoy a donuthole on me @_date: 2015-01-12 08:15:32
Your wallet should remain but possibly moved
@_date: 2015-01-26 09:33:05
Oh good I didn't see a date!!
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:59:17
Nope, who does that? 
@_date: 2015-01-24 10:43:07
His private pgp key can be useful
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:39:53
Yup I made so much bitcoin on bfl gen 1 then lost it all on gen 2. Still waiting for a monarch.
@_date: 2015-05-31 04:22:39
Tomorrow bro
@_date: 2015-05-03 00:42:00
Never! 
@_date: 2014-10-19 19:50:31
It's great for giving a friend a quick secure paper wallet
@_date: 2014-11-10 05:27:29
Someone's going to make a coin
@_date: 2014-11-24 17:52:41
No they already fully attack websites
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:18:05
Enjoy a donuthole on me @_date: 2015-01-04 17:02:36
Pretty soon maybe when .10 is official
@_date: 2015-01-17 07:52:04
And diagonal
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:13:47
Fuck you shitcoin
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:30:21
Not pre-order so they didn't scam us, that's up to their investors
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:10:56
@_date: 2015-05-15 21:12:15
Sure but the irc allows anyone to anonymously use the order book
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:23:47
Cool as long as you're safe and happy
$1 @_date: 2015-01-21 03:36:21

Ehh I want people getting fired up and think I'm tarded
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:30:22
I would never trust an extension
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:44:50
Yes and you'll be one of them
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:48:45
I don't care who you are. I'm a better Bitcoiner than you ever will be. Why don't you go get btc.com next for everhooscoin. Stop thinking you're a bitleader. We're all equals.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:04:55
Well he might need my address, still trying to find a way, maybe I'll just buy cards
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:54:04
They're bits, millionth of a Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-17 07:51:44
Bitpay should ask him to resign! Sick
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:41:45
Don't shitcoin don't mine. There is no daily income. Hodl btc or lose.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:50:13
Worse than paycoiners lmao
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:46:12
Yup it's Homero Garza
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:05:02
People laugh at me when I say never click, always type
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:11:23
Yes safe

More dollars
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:42:28
$1 million
@_date: 2015-01-08 07:34:28
No they'd lose it then
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:26:08
Size doesn't magically increase. It's a max not the current. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:56:57
@_date: 2014-12-08 03:07:39
Yeah they're a scam
@_date: 2014-09-06 00:16:58
They have algorithms to accept 0 confirmation transactions while insuring they'll get mined. They check fees, propagation, etc. Mycelium local trader has a progress bar. These guys I think are exposing it via api for anyone 
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:10:37
In your url
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:48:48
They can't just refund everybody
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:34:14
Why? Aren't most shorting? 
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:51:42
Circle has always been .5% cheaper for me I always check
@_date: 2015-01-23 11:09:43
Here's my entries, please steal
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:01:55
We need much more even
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:28:40
Yup CENTRALIZED shitcoin
@_date: 2015-05-30 08:16:54
And cocaine cures depression
@_date: 2015-05-05 02:50:50
And doge and Litecoin
@_date: 2015-05-29 06:55:42
Be strong
@_date: 2015-05-07 04:37:44
I'd like your feedback 
I made the distinction on your behalf
@_date: 2015-01-17 07:50:13
Disgusting why the fuck is it brighter
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:21:06
No you'll pay on what you're pulling out. If you doubled your money but pull out half, that's 50% profit. Taxes are little though.
@_date: 2015-01-30 21:15:25
Bitcoin 2.0 = shitcoin pumpers
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:26:57
It's the only good alt coin and it's not normally pumped and dumped
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:56:55
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:40:06
Peasant food for the Bitcoin rich
Enjoy a donuthole on me @_date: 2015-01-25 10:21:09
Armory offline
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:00:06
Yah there's gotta be centralized fiat counter party risk somewhere
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:20:03
Beware there's more ethereum, stamp and road coins left to dump but we're getting close
@_date: 2015-01-09 07:43:00
You can go the other way, it's just almost impossible
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:46:56
It's too distributed and has very high mining to be a real shitcoin like Litecoin
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:01:43
-disablewallet too
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:18:03
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:52:09
Sold out I tried
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:16:57
Wat? He's blaming Mark lol
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:00:08
Yes but if you hold 10 then they'll be multiplied by the amount they're divided, you don't lose. You'll have the value of 10x 7 billion people
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:01:33
Looks like that's the hacker just holding it for some reason
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:17:59
Buy low, sell high
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:44:20
The Bitcoin foundation lawyer works for gaw and sued to censor coin fire
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:59:11
Coin fire just trying to buy cheap Homero coin! 
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:06:08
I'll bring potato salad

Relax he enjoys buying from dumpers
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:53:35
Stupid early adopters getting free $200 coin
@_date: 2015-05-19 09:13:52
Nah Apple will die just like paycoin
@_date: 2015-05-05 12:50:38
They're using cloud wallets now, no need for core
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:28:14
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:18:54
Hahaha 
@_date: 2014-11-26 04:49:18
Here we do not cloud mine or shitcoin
@_date: 2014-11-19 15:20:56
Send knc to be beheaded
@_date: 2014-11-25 16:40:03
Nah they're doing medical shit now like hp
@_date: 2014-10-10 01:36:17
@_date: 2014-08-22 04:22:51
Yup, I've already dumped all my fiat
@_date: 2015-05-23 19:28:40
No, the people owning it have it multiplied, no one gets inflation
@_date: 2015-01-26 09:42:58
Hope panic buyers learn to panic hodl
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:02:51
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:34:03
Many people think mining is free
@_date: 2015-01-01 06:12:02
Maybe I should say he's taking up slots
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:56:46
Bitfinex is BIG
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:42:18
Bitfinex should be more legit

@_date: 2015-01-04 04:41:50
Nda bro
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:47:34
And the cnn interview
@_date: 2014-08-31 21:14:37
No problem
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:29:46
Man I gotta go do something
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:21:17
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:53:47
Why not straw paw
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:02:14
Because they use fees to judge good transactions
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:15:28
That's how Bitcoin began as hashcash
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:04:20
@_date: 2015-01-04 05:27:31
Thanks, you live and you die by Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:38:14
Smart guy
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:32:02
How about a shitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:36:42
Could have been very quick after the one before
@_date: 2015-01-17 06:49:20
Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:10:07
I like tether
@_date: 2015-01-31 22:53:01
On your phone, has to be precise

Yes circle.com
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:22:42
That's because the banks are starting to enter and at a good price. The paid banker shills are either losing their jobs or going to start promoting Bitcoin. I just saw basedghandi switch sides this week. Nobodybelievesyou is entering the cucumber industry. His old passion.
@_date: 2014-11-24 05:50:24
You can spend horizontally
@_date: 2015-01-24 05:32:35

Haha what a slave
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:49:51
Yay it's back
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:38:58
Me too, but I enjoy going there to see Litecoin, doge, and all the rest decrease weekly so leave them. It's what the site is for.
@_date: 2015-01-10 07:35:15
I'm using armory offline
@_date: 2015-05-03 23:25:13
Yeah I dumped instantly, couldn't believe it
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:18:58
You can't rebroadcast until the first expires otherwise you're double spending
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:52:44
Yes maybe the local business wasn't ready
@_date: 2015-01-21 05:54:59
Nope it'll only get worse
@_date: 2015-01-16 08:14:44
Actually it may be correct with the new 1099k rules but I doubt it, ask zenpayroll
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:01:13
Yes distribution is getting better. Whales dumping is good.
There's lots of sites like
  
 
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:39:56
Perv very unprofessional
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:17:23
I hear they're adding shitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:06:32
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:51:51
Man that sounds hot
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:47:31
Yeah but I think we're risking tbs tnt etc which I need, that's the problem
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:31:46
They do send Bitcoin refunds at today's value so that's a positive
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:21:25
Let's make a ponzi
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:03:20
Paid banker shills
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:43:36
Try using opendns
@_date: 2014-12-23 23:21:53
It was a scam last time 
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:01:56
Where's the realistic panic chart
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:48:38
Idk you could get disturbed
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:45:15

No oxygen this high! ! 
@_date: 2015-01-24 09:10:41
Haha that points idiot
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:08:48
Actually it's good reserve psychology, Bitcoin used to be for nerds
@_date: 2015-01-01 09:33:29
I tried vultr too but not many locations and no imaging so I went back to do
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:29:41
The selfish mining fork
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:18:04
In this case it's hard coded into the device
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:14:04
What will you do about the criminal nature of the foundation? From promoting altcoins to having their lawyer also work for paycoin? 
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:18:15
Someone has to steal that projector, stupid moe
@_date: 2015-01-30 09:50:21
Fine sell the preprogrammed atmel with a logo Powered by Trezor. Trezor needs to be a trusted brand and code, not a one off wallet. No one would buy a generic otherwise anyway. Btw trezor isn't in America, they may not have antitrust laws. Thanks for helping to polish my idea.
Link your project I supposedly downvoted.
@_date: 2015-01-01 11:28:56

Probably more so, banks charge you to use your money ;)
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:57:12

Looks like you're right. Very odd because 1099-K is only sent to sellers (and the IRS) when that seller has processed over $20,000 in sales volume and 200 transactions with that processor. They added it to increase reporting but removed $600 1099-misc? Crazy. You're still required to keep w9s on file though. I guess let Coinbase handle it. But that's an odd part too. Will Coinbase only do 1099k for merchant accounts? How do they know if it's a payment or self deposit. You might want to send 1099misc anyway and double report. Depends on how legit your company has to be.

Don't invest! Buy to use when needed. Geez only invest in Bitcoin. Plus xcp burned the initial Bitcoin so that's a plus. Fucking greedy idiots trying to pump shitcoin. Not you personally. People can't look past their greed and use it like a tool. Would you invest in a hundred phones? No you use 1.
I'm so fucking tired of these idiots who invested in ether. 99% have no clue what it does and never intended to use it, just to pump it. Fuck em. Dumb mother fuckers centralized 37k btc like fools.

They do have your full social once they asked you those questions so possible collections but guaranteed they'll seize your money if you ever use them again or someone sends to you by email, etc
14. Insufficient Funds
If your account has insufficient funds or a deposit is rejected or reversed, Circle may deduct amounts you owe from the balance of your account or from funds you subsequently deposit or receive into your account. If you have more than one account, Circle may set off the negative balance in one account by using any balance that you hold in your other accounts. To secure your performance of this Agreement, you grant to Circle a lien on and security interest in and to the balances in your account.
For example, if you deposit $50 by credit card and that deposit is reversed by your bank after you’ve spent the funds, we reserve the right to deduct $50 from your account balance or your next deposit.

Just a guess but you securely share your private key of a temporary transaction and or share a 2of2 for a new transaction with a trusted service and add nlocktime, this guarantees you can't double spend which is what instant confirmations means, real confirmations still take 10 minutes

@_date: 2014-10-17 01:27:26

I figured out the password wallet. Take your seed, it should have a ! Delete whatever is after it, sha256 your password and add that after !
Try it then try your current wallet

@_date: 2015-01-26 07:53:02
@_date: 2015-01-17 06:53:52
She'd arrest him 
@_date: 2015-01-27 07:32:04
Then he may never get verified
@_date: 2015-05-09 06:10:07
Could've been funnier

This fat man named Mark owned an exchange called mt gox, he lost 500k bitcoins because he was busy trying to build a cafe under his office. The moral is to never leave your Bitcoin on your exchange 
@_date: 2015-01-16 18:57:08
Phones already have great secure elements
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:13:06
Then they'll be instantly seized of course
@_date: 2015-01-01 12:59:48
Upload your wallet to Blockchain
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:12:56
There's 13 million bitcoins currently, not many are online
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:04:21
Trial is even shadier 
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:39:53
That's when the forum lost data
@_date: 2015-01-23 00:41:38
They're in beta, they never actually announced and their service leaked but I'm very confident in them
@_date: 2015-01-22 05:48:16
If it happens I'll eat chicken feet
@_date: 2015-01-04 05:04:09
Lol so where's the cashtaker money? 
@_date: 2015-01-21 02:22:37
He had his epiphany on the knc forums when he learned not to stop scams but how to create his own
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:06:27
Yeah that's bs

No they'll dump more seized Bitcoin, we'll be paying
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:14:47
Then that's what we're upset about, paycoin is a 96% premined pump and dump, you can't say ignore it and not researched it
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:24:47
We hate you gypsy
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:49:16
Source? 
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:01:37
He claims cash takers require massive amounts of power. In reality a pi can stake unlimited coin.
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:06:38
No you'll break it

@_date: 2015-01-13 02:45:35
They're paid to confirm transactions
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:19:40
Their logo there gives them legitimacy creating more victims, like when ver did the Gox video or Andreas working at neo bee which lost me Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-21 04:56:41

@_date: 2015-01-21 00:35:53
Why'd you need our help with Coinbase
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:52:31
Preach to us
@_date: 2015-01-31 23:21:25
This is why trezor can use their reputation by selling their code with support. I'd totally buy this powered by trezor vs the Trezor.

Bitcoin is gsm, shitcoin is nextel.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:44:47
Because we ignore shitcoin payment processors, only go to businesses with bitpay
@_date: 2015-01-02 08:43:03
More scamming
@_date: 2015-01-11 11:11:31
It's great for distribution

His crash plan didn't succeed, we stuck together and took down the wall! 
@_date: 2014-09-05 04:55:51
You take colored coins, centrally generate a certain number and distribute them. People can prove they voted and the vote can't be changed. The vote is public and who voted what can be secret if distribution is anonymous. You store that someone got a coin but not which one.
The power comes from everyone seeing the votes but no one can change them.
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:11:53
Yeah I kitten

@_date: 2015-01-15 20:35:02
Ah that's what Bitreserve does, circle should offer the option
@_date: 2015-01-31 23:04:18
No one praises him but himself,  mircea is a clown. He used to pretend to be a girl doing his own pr on the forums until he was banned.

You can only publish a small hash

@_date: 2015-01-11 13:02:22

Aren't they promising to buy the coins on the exchanges? 
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:36:08
Trezor is bullet proof

@_date: 2015-01-15 11:50:53
So people donated 30k btc? Lol ok
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:30:13
They're still waiting for $20 even after Homero denies it and deleted all his promises
@_date: 2015-01-17 15:43:48
If he didn't remove them
@_date: 2015-05-04 23:16:11
Write down trezor seed

It still needs a little watching, v2 may have a web page monitor and auto updates
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:37:32
Josh confirmed that when he says third party escrow, he means himself lol
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:21:43
They seem very butthurt. This is business101. What you do is secretly sell your own generic.

You're confusing data with hashes, the blockchain shouldn't be used for data, pruning can verify through hash tree

Upload your wallet to blockchain.info
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:29:20
It could, they're trying to find other means like an audio cable.
But even usb has to execute and since it's a text file, you shouldn't be executing anything
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:08:41
Can't prove they're unique

@_date: 2015-01-02 18:06:32
I'll save that argument for another day, you shouldn't be a bitleader if you aren't a Bitcoin extremist.
But surely paycoin is trash and being there will make the whole conference a joke.
@_date: 2015-01-21 03:56:10
No it's still good

I'm not sure how quickly New work can get to workers. How often is it? I'm pretty sure a new root hash can be computed in ms if they try. Then stratum sends it quickly. Sending new work a minute after the old block wastes 10% of the 10 minutes.

@_date: 2015-07-05 10:45:35
From where? 
@_date: 2015-07-06 00:41:07
Prices come down, you save up, you know like a market without bubbles, you buy a house for $50k, not $700k using fake money paying the bank free interest for life
@_date: 2015-07-03 01:48:07
Yes! That would be awesome!!

Lol no one accepts gold, there is no spending power
@_date: 2015-07-02 11:35:41
Yeah but everyone laughs at Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be the only choice someday and they'll hope it's not too late. We didn't cause this but we can use it to show others how much Bitcoin is needed.
@_date: 2015-07-01 00:49:52
Costs go down as more people use it, so avoiding Bitcoin is worse

Yes and we'd use a lot more if the investors stopped increasing the price, now we're using less and electronics suffer, I see many fake gold contacts tarnishing. The old Nintendo cartridges would still be working if we could've used more gold
@_date: 2015-07-01 06:12:11

@_date: 2015-07-05 11:50:23
No one would think that up, he started it and always uses it but always seems to mention "they call me Bitcoin Jesus"
@_date: 2015-07-05 06:09:30
No one buys Microsoft certificates
@_date: 2015-07-04 09:04:22
I don't see why they don't run a rugged node on a vps and use gbt or stratum or whatever, seems dumb to trust random nodes like this situation
@_date: 2015-07-08 06:36:36
Tax by inflation is probably the best for fairness and enforcement, yet they inflate anyway and taxes are just a bonus
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:58:38
They'll convert because shitcoiners have no loyalty and their greed will make them lose in the long run
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:21:19

Gold is archaic, it's a joke for humans to see something shiny and value it, no merchant accepts gold

She's kinda hot
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:36:43
What happens? It creates another wallet.dat? 
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:13:46
If he wasnt all words, he'd volunteer at voat, they obviously really need this for the hosting alone
@_date: 2015-07-07 10:41:34
@_date: 2015-07-07 23:37:15
It goes to the developers, the volunteers still don't get paid, it's for more servers
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:30:17
He's in the same boat as Roger ver, scum bags
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:44:39
you dont like girls in this industry?

Roll into an ira
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:51:57
@_date: 2015-07-04 08:41:26
A miner was signaling v3 but wasn't actually enforcing it and they built on top of v2
@_date: 2015-07-05 10:37:49
The first had a few transactions but no one could've planned for it
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:00:50
My armory is trying but if the transaction is huge, no one will give me a 1mb transaction
@_date: 2015-07-20 01:05:10
Oh I do, this was a long term plan
@_date: 2015-07-05 10:15:49
No and it's dumb because their international payments page is full of junk
@_date: 2015-07-10 09:40:17
I just laugh at them here 
@_date: 2015-07-08 11:42:02
Yeah wtf 60 = 1??
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:10:36
Fuck off with badbitcoin
They pump every mining scam and paycoin
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:10:04
Can confirm
@_date: 2015-07-03 12:55:38
@_date: 2015-07-04 08:44:27
I hope brewster gets executed
@_date: 2015-07-07 23:18:31
Probably never, just run many nodes, electrum servers, joinmarket, explorers, etc
@_date: 2015-07-08 05:37:30
They gotta service that paycoin staker and cash out Homero
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:04:01
No because nodes can be faked
@_date: 2015-07-03 10:48:28
So you can audit the chain of custody, issuance will usually be centralized
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:27:43
They did a lot
@_date: 2015-07-04 09:15:05
Look at her grease ball husband
@_date: 2015-07-03 11:22:40
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:48:32

@_date: 2015-07-03 06:27:49
Mods here better not get their panties wet too, we got shit to do
@_date: 2015-07-05 10:19:39
Imitate (good deeds). Not impersonate! 
@_date: 2015-07-10 05:03:02
They let Charlie pump here it's disgusting, shitcoiners have no loyalty, the pumpers are merely trying to get more Bitcoin from the dumb sheep
@_date: 2015-07-10 03:37:35
Shitcoin pumpers always lose
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:06:12
Libertarian with a checkbook
@_date: 2015-07-04 08:48:20
These huge Chinese miners don't even have nodes? 
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:35:45
Sure bro, that paycoin staker was just for fun
@_date: 2015-07-03 00:41:24
That's their only business
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:12:31
My dream used to be opening a mining warehouse until knc fucked me over
@_date: 2015-07-06 00:38:18
Yes forking is safe, it's only dangerous for merchants
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:37:53
There's a proxy where you can pretend to be a node while not storing anything, people will fake thousands and actually make real nodes quit. Miners have proof of work, nodes have no proof.
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:48:38
Why would they go to Italy? 
@_date: 2015-07-03 12:41:57
No but you downloading something is a virus
@_date: 2015-07-10 09:19:12
In this moment I am euphoric.
@_date: 2015-07-05 06:33:49
Used to be thousands, looks cheaper now 
Not sure if that includes authenticode though

You didn't backup before? 
@_date: 2015-04-02 00:43:33
Wrong paycoin vouches for it
@_date: 2015-04-05 00:24:08
I think we should be provocative instead

Maybe they meant they had records but as mortgages were traded, they lost track of who owns it, data storage can easily be added with Amazon though
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:31:47
Yes it does, have you ever traded forex? No one "calls you" unless you're a huge bank. Individuals do not get calls, they get immediate liquidation. Brokers are not in the debt collection business.
@_date: 2015-04-05 13:36:03
I envision the blockchain building and using weapons like HAARP, Bitcoin evolution will not be accepted easily. Those stealing and dumping bitcoins will be its first target. Those corrupt agents will not be safe in prison, along with Homero.
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:56:17
Haha fuck him

From what I remember from p2pool, you don't need to find Bitcoin blocks. You submit Bitcoin blocks to p2pool but find Namecoin blocks privately. But difficulty is very high due to all the Bitcoin mining, but not everyone merge mines.
Namecoin needed a hard fork to let you use Bitcoin pow. After that there's no relationship. Slush invented it.
I merge mined Bitcoin, Namecoin, ix, i0, devcoin and groupcoin on p2pool and mmpool. P2pool did not pool merge mine, mmpool did.
@_date: 2015-04-13 19:08:42
Yes I mean some people think they won't get it offline, you just need to sync

Yes it can be encrypted offline. Remember only 100 keys are generated before a new backup needs to be done. This reason is why encryption forks from a non encrypted wallet, it regenerates the key pool. Always keep and make old backups. Sweep to a new address to get encrypted keys.

Everyone in the world have ability to issue REMI as long as they have Bitcoin to secure the value of REMI. If you want to to issue REMI, first deposit some Bitcoin with Remitano. Then mortgage your Bitcoin to issue equivalent REMI. Currently, you can issue up to 200 REMI for every Bitcoin. Also, you DON'T have to pay any interest.

I love chicken nuggets
"As Christian Williams, our new Head of User Experience, noted:
I sent a few tips around to people on Facebook and noticed that the one that was the most readily accepted was not denominated in bits, nor in dollars - but it was a rose. The act of sending someone a flower - and having my aunt think about me handing her a flower over the Internet - was the impetus to have her open an account and learn about Bitcoin. "
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:00:46
Yeah but we're not there yet, trezor was more important, tor can already be used though
@_date: 2015-03-17 00:44:53
Tons of pumping lately

Scum should let me disable authy, I don't use that centralized shit

I think it's up to tellers to buy sell Bitcoin like lbc
@_date: 2015-03-23 11:16:19
Oh for authy, I use google authenticator. This is a common problem of getting looked out. You should securely save the qr code they give you.
And you can't blame them for free Bitcoin being over. That was a leak anyway.
These issues aren't really circles fault.

I've actually talked to them a lot during the beta but I'm sure they can't be as quick anymore. Your questions might just be confusing them. So the fee you learned. Bofa charges cash advance fees.

She is widely credited with creating the modern credit default swap, a derivative used to manage credit exposure to underlying reference entities.[7] In 1994, J.P. Morgan had extended a $4.8 billion credit line to Exxon, which faced the threat of $5 billion in punitive damages for the Exxon Valdez oil spill. A team of J.P. Morgan bankers led by Masters then purchased credit protection against the credit line to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to cut the capital which J.P. Morgan was required to hold against Exxon's default, thus reducing its own risk. J.P. Morgan later bundled together packages of such exposures and offered them to market as BISTRO, for Broad Index Secured Trust Offering, and these new financial instruments were quickly adopted by other banking institutions.

Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust is poised to become the first publicly traded bitcoin fund, with approval and assignment of a ticker symbol by the financial industry’s main self-regulatory body paving the way for trading on an electronic platform operated by OTC Markets Group .
The BIT, which was first launched in 2013 as a private fund for accredited investors with annual incomes greater than $200,000 or assets of more than $1 million, has been racing against a rival offering by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, best known for their lawsuit against Facebook Inc. chief executive Mark Zuckerberg .
Whereas the competing Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is going through a lengthy Securities and Exchange Commission process to register a formal exchange-traded fund, the BIT as taken a backdoor route to public listing. By exploiting a rule that allows holders of a private fund to sell their shares publicly after a 12-month lockup period and completing a less arduous approval process with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, some of those long-held shares in BIT should soon be available to investors of any income or wealth bracket. The BIT is sponsored by Grayscale Investments, a unit of Mr. Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, which he established last year to hold the digital currency interests of his broker-dealer SecondMarket Inc.

Banks do scary shit.
She is widely credited with creating the modern credit default swap, a derivative used to manage credit exposure to underlying reference entities.[7] In 1994, J.P. Morgan had extended a $4.8 billion credit line to Exxon, which faced the threat of $5 billion in punitive damages for the Exxon Valdez oil spill. A team of J.P. Morgan bankers led by Masters then purchased credit protection against the credit line to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to cut the capital which J.P. Morgan was required to hold against Exxon's default, thus reducing its own risk. J.P. Morgan later bundled together packages of such exposures and offered them to market as BISTRO, for Broad Index Secured Trust Offering, and these new financial instruments were quickly adopted by other banking institutions.

RPC access control changes
Subnet matching for the purpose of access control is now done by matching the binary network address, instead of with string wildcard matching. For the user this means that -rpcallowip takes a subnet specification, which can be
a single IP address (e.g. 1.2.3.4 or fe80::0012:3456:789a:bcde)
a network/CIDR (e.g. 1.2.3.0/24 or fe80::0000/64)
a network/netmask (e.g. 1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0 or fe80::0012:3456:789a:bcde/ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff)
An arbitrary number of -rpcallow arguments can be given. An incoming connection will be accepted if its origin address matches one of them.
For example:
0.9.x and before	0.10.x
-rpcallowip=192.168.1.1	-rpcallowip=192.168.1.1 (unchanged)
-rpcallowip=192.168.1.*	-rpcallowip=192.168.1.0/24
-rpcallowip=192.168.*	-rpcallowip=192.168.0.0/16
-rpcallowip=* (dangerous!)	-rpcallowip=::/0 (still dangerous!)
Using wildcards will result in the rule being rejected with the following error in debug.log:
Error: Invalid -rpcallowip subnet specification: *. Valid are a single IP (e.g. 1.2.3.4), a network/netmask (e.g. 1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0) or a network/CIDR (e.g. 1.2.3.4/24).

Look, if he plead guilty, a sentence would have been reached aka a plea bargain. So of course there could be a plea bargain. Plea = plead, bargain = sentence. You think the prosecution would just quit and let the judge decide? No they'd make an offer. Possibly 50 to life, so he declined the plea bargain and went ahead without a defense other than blaming Karpeles. Again, a plea bargain was possible. It's always available.

Improved signing security
For 0.10 the security of signing against unusual attacks has been improved by making the signatures constant time and deterministic.
This change is a result of switching signing to use libsecp256k1 instead of OpenSSL. Libsecp256k1 is a cryptographic library optimized for the curve Bitcoin uses which was created by Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille.
There exist attacks[1] against most ECC implementations where an attacker on shared virtual machine hardware could extract a private key if they could cause a target to sign using the same key hundreds of times. While using shared hosts and reusing keys are inadvisable for other reasons, it's a better practice to avoid the exposure.
OpenSSL has code in their source repository for derandomization and reduction in timing leaks that we've eagerly wanted to use for a long time, but this functionality has still not made its way into a released version of OpenSSL. Libsecp256k1 achieves significantly stronger protection: As far as we're aware this is the only deployed implementation of constant time signing for the curve Bitcoin uses and we have reason to believe that libsecp256k1 is better tested and more thoroughly reviewed than the implementation in OpenSSL.

It adds a url to the qr code and payment link
The bitcoin: URI scheme is extended with an additional, optional "r" parameter, whose value is a URL from which a PaymentRequest message should be fetched (characters not allowed within the scope of a query parameter must be percent-encoded as described in RFC 3986 and bip-0021).
If the "r" parameter is provided and backwards compatibility is not required, then the bitcoin address portion of the URI may be omitted (the URI will be of the form: bitcoin:?r=... ).
When Bitcoin wallet software that supports this BIP receives a bitcoin: URI with a request parameter, it should ignore the bitcoin address/amount/label/message in the URI and instead fetch a PaymentRequest message and then follow the payment protocol, as described in BIP 70.
Human-readable, secure payment destinations-- customers will be asked to authorize payment to "example.com" instead of an inscrutable, 34-character bitcoin address.
Secure proof of payment, which the customer can use in case of a dispute with the merchant.
Resistance from man-in-the-middle attacks that replace a merchant's bitcoin address with an attacker's address before a transaction is authorized with a hardware wallet.
Payment received messages, so the customer knows immediately that the merchant has received, and has processed (or is processing) their payment.
Refund addresses, automatically given to the merchant by the customer's wallet software, so merchants do not have to contact customers before refunding overpayments or orders that cannot be fulfilled for some reason.

Lol. Here's the secret, shh. They charge your bank account via ach. The credit card is only charged if your bank bounces the payment. Coinbase doesn't accept cards directly, circle does though.

@_date: 2015-02-13 13:56:51
I feel similar but this change should've happened a long time ago. Subnets are standard practice. Please note, rpc isn't used much. Any miner usually only runs one node. Alts will break and you won't know who updated syntax or not.

Yes blockchain direct onion would go directly to their server vs ssl passing through the tor network, most onion dont even need ssl, the only onion ive seen also using ssl is Facebook, not many sites have a direct onion, only risk is using the wrong onion because it's not easily human readable, Facebook has a nice vanity onion
These are the only two onions with ssl
