I took this screenshot at 11:44pm PDT on Oct 17, 2019.  In the background is a live coinbase pro order book and foreground is the price quoted by regular Coinbase for a purchase of $1000 worth of Bitcoin.  Notice the latter quote is for $7,955 while Coinbase Pro is showing an ask of $7,917.  So not only do you pay a 1.49% trading fee on coinbase regular but you also pay about $40 more for Bitcoin?

Hello, I've never bought bitcoin before but want to join the bandwagon : )  I see there are many exchanges and they change their fees frequently, so most articles on the internet and reddit posts about fees are already out of date.  I thought I'd post my findings based on fees I looked up today.  
I should note my cost comparison is for my specific use case which is to use US$10k in a US bank to buy bitcoin as a maker and store it in a hardware wallet.  My bank charges a $25 wire fee, and I am not able to ACH to third party. (If I could ACH to a third party, then the Kraken total cost for example, would be much lower). Based on the my cost analysis in the image of my spreadsheet above, I'm calculating that Binance is the cheapest at $14 total cost (using Coinbase to ACH USD in, converting to USDC, transferring to Binance, buying bitcoin, and then withdrawing to a hardware wallet).
Thought I'd post this to see if anyone wants to double check my research and in case it helps anyone else.  Thanks!

What's the reason coinbase would keep inventory for retail order flow other than to charge a premium?  I'm just wondering does the customer benefit at all from this?

You can only ACH push to Kraken by initiating a third party ACH from your bank, but most banks don't have that functionality (for example Bank of America has that feature but Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, TIAA Bank don't).  You can't for example enter your bank info into Kraken and have Kraken ACH pull from your bank account like you can with Coinbase.

Thanks for the replies so far.  A couple updates.  Turns out Binance.com is not available to US investors, only Binance.us and the latter only in certain states, none of which I have an address in.  
Also Binance.com has a current promotion of 0 maker fees for trading BUSD/BTC.  BUSD is their version of USDC from my cursory look. So it seems if you ACH&gt;Coinbase Pro&gt;USDC&gt;transfer to Binance.com&gt;BUSD&gt;BTC&gt;withdraw to hard wallet, then you only pay $4 per $10k for that entire chain?
So if I can VPN from another country and open a Binance.com account then the above would be the cheapest way.

To answer your questions: I'm in the US looking to buy $5k at a time. I have all payment methods available. I don't need access to proceeds anytime soon.  Privacy isn't super important and I will transfer to a hardware wallet.  I have cash app but it charges 1.76% to buy BTC while binance only charges 0.10%. I'm looking for lowest cost.  Currently bank&gt;coinbase pro&gt;USDC&gt;binance.com&gt;BTC&gt;hardware wallet seems to be the cheapest way to buy large amounts of BTC.  Do you know of a better way?
Thank you for your explanation regarding Google Auth.  Want to make sure I completely understand. I get that if you have a recovery number for Gmail a phone port could reset your Gmail pass take control of Gmail and then through that reset your Coinbase password.  But if you're using Google Auth (and not Authy/SMS) then the hacker would still not be able to get control of Google Auth right? (Unless he contacted coinbase support to reset Google Auth but I believe that takes a while and involves manual ID verification?  If anyone knows the exact coinbase Google Auth reset steps requirements I'd love to know).

Interesting.  From a subsequent Google search it seems he was awarded $75mln from the 21 yo thief.  If what was stolen was a shitcoin that went to zero in value, doesn't seem like the thief will be able to pay him back.

How do you on ramp your fiat then?  I don't trade with coinbase or CB pro but it's the cheapest place to transfer in USD and then convert to USDC to then send for free to a low cost exchange like binance to buy crypto.
How would phone porting work as an attack on Google Auth?
