None of those guarantee that gold will have a high value.
Aluminium was once much more expensive than gold and had a guaranteed utility value as luxury metal. Until someone came up with a very cheap way to make it. The value crashed and today its so cheap we even use it for cans and people dont want it for jewelry anymore because its so cheap. The value is very low.
"At this time aluminum was more expensive than gold and platinum1, and it was regarded as "the new precious metal". A bar of aluminum was even exhibited at the Paris Exhibition in 1855. But over the next ten years its value fell by over 90% although it was still far too expensive to be adopted by industry as the metal of choice. Gradually methods were improved upon and in 1885 a process was developed with an annual output of 15 tonnes."
If someone brings home an asteroid with gold, value of gold will also plummet.
"Within three years, two firms plan prospecting missions to passing asteroids. When even a modest space rock might meet demand for metals like platinum or gold for centuries"

Actually lots of people don´t want freedom very much, they prefer being secure. 
Wedding is a good example.

It takes at most 3 seconds for a transaction to propagate the whole network. There is no "latency" you are making things up.
The Bitcoin network would not even work today if it took any longer than that. For 99.99% of small transactions thats enough security.

How much was the cost for Humble Bundle and if it was such a cost why did they add it to the Humble Bundle store.
You are the one making a strawman, saying it will create lots of support costs when in proven reality it will not. If that was true it would had been removed from every single merchant today.

Come on, the company earns more money than most companies in the world and can afford to add a payment button because support for it would be expensive?
