Hey damontoo, what happens if I ask DogecoinMachine, who happens to be the owner of a bitcoin gaming site (crypto-games), which I happen to know, and I ask him to come in this thread and explain to your stupid ass that I am not him. Would that be ok with you?

Gridcoin has done 75 billion credits across 63 different Boinc scientific projects. I hardly think that is what shitcoins do!! How much scientific work have you done Moosecountry05?

We need to resurrect Alan Turing so he can build us a machine to decode this.

It is traceable only in the case of complete novice users, let's be honest about that.

"The imitation game" is a really good movie about Turing's machine. If it wasn't for this guy, the Nazis would have won.

So anyone who posts anything about btcfeed will now be banned immediately? Are you suggesting that DogecoinMachine is my account?
And how about you answer my first question, how come BTCFeed articles have been on the first page of ,sometimes even several articles simultaneously. Ohhh, I know, it must be a conspiracy on behalf of the admins of BTCfeed.

Hey damontoo, if btcfeed is so bad, how come several of their articles were upvoted to the front page of Is it possible that people liked their stories, created a new acc and then submitted the story to Reddit? The fact that an acc has only submitted material from 1 domain, does not mean that acc is a spamming one. You are drawing conclusions off of flimsy evidence and your own prejudices.

Anyone who thinks or claims that Universities and Boinc are scams needs to get his head out of his ass and read this:
