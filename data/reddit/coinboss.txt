I suppose it was cheaper and easier to just pay off the goon squad and make them go away.  I would have done the same thing., However, crowdfunding is perfectly legal since the HIRE Act.  Voorhees could have won an important precedent case here, but instead we should now expect a shakedown of Cryptostocks, Havelock and others...Pay the ransom once and they'll keep kidnapping.

Yes, Bitcoin is a Type 1 currency, but it's better to call it "international" rather than "one-world" because of its negative baggage linked to control.
And, yes, distributed ENERGY is the key to a Type 1 civilization living in harmony.  That is coming too.  Open-source solutions are already floating around...

I've had delays where coins seemed to disappear. I submitted a support ticket and it was taken care of.  It took like 24 hours, but it was fixed accurately.  All-in-all these exchanges are handling the growing pains nicely.  Cryptsy is solid and has a bright future.

Anything that requires a timestamp or a public registry can conceivably be replaced with the bitcoin protocol.  Wills, contracts, stocks, bonds, automatic payments (insurance, pensions, etc), voting, governing, etc, etc.  The only limitations will be our imagination.

I use Coinbase to buy bitcoin with gov't-issued IOUs.
I can spend them anywhere on the Internet now using SnapCard.  Hence I will never sell them back for more gov't IOUs.
Who uses it? Everyone I know is either using it or talking about it.
Black market? Yes, I've used Silk Road before the bust.  Wonderful, peaceful, voluntary market until the mafia thugs raided it.  However, USD still makes for a better black market currency.
Hacking?  Hacking into the Bitcoin protocol is highly unlikely as its network is now 200X the 500 best supercomputers combined (Forbes). Individual bitcoin service providers can be hacked.
The biggest risk I see is Wall Street messing with its value to discredit it until they come out with their (bankers) version. Google 'JP Chase Bitcoin Patent'.

Fantastic article! The incentive to build up the Bitcoin ecosystem is so great right now and the infrastructure is already worth billions. Infrastructure takes immense resources to build but does not go away easily once built. And we're just getting started.

It only loses value if you trade them for dollars.  Gold goes up and down, too.  But the store of value is in holding them until the laws of supply (limited in case of BTC) and demand (more adoption) are more in your favor -- that is if your goal is to make more dollars from them.

Ask him if transferring $1 million to China instantly has value.  What does that cost him to do securely now?

Cryptocurrencies will be part of the matrix for the foreseeable future.  It's still very EARLY days, but it's clear that adoption will grow.  How do I know it's clear this will happen?  Because all you have to do is use bitcoin once or twice to experience its utility.  
Bitcoins are already VERY liquid and likely to become even easier.  You can already buy anything on the Internet with bitcoin using SnapCard.  You can buy gas cards, Target and Whole Foods gift cards, and plane tickets.  That's liquid.
In short, cryptocurrencies will be a big part of our future.  By getting in now, you may benefit from the rising value as wider adoption takes root.

I look at my $300/mth of btc purchases as a contribution to tearing down the criminal banking system.  It is currently our best tool for doing so.  No protests, fighting, or war needed.  And, yes, that means I also believe btc will become the world's reserve currency that all central bankers will bow to.
Making a profit on my btc is just bonus as far as I'm concerned.  
Also, like many bitcoiners, I will NEVER sell mine for gov't paper.  I will only trade them for real things...
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:04:52
Conspiracy guys have an immediate knee-jerk reaction to digital currencies due to the stated goal of the globalists that they want a one-world cashless currency. That's the endgame for complete control.
But all these guys will come around as they learn how self-empowering and incorruptable this technology is, and it is just the start of decentralization of the power structures in society.
Bitcoin is also completely voluntary and always will be.  No coercion from authorities, yet.
Finally, Bitcoin represents a huge transfer of wealth to liberty-minded people all over the world. If Alex Jones or any other liberty activists want to know what bitcoin is, it's called WINNING.

DPR's bitcoins were likely in an unregistered paper or mind (brain) wallet and are probably lost to the network forever. So, theoretically, shouldn't BTC increase in value since the overall supply is now reduced?
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:59:53
They all come around eventually when they are forced to actually find out what Bitcoin really is.  
Then they all go, "Oh My, isn't that interesting." Then they rush to open a Coinbase account to get them some and tell everyone they know.  Krugman is dumb but he ain't stupid. He'll be buying bitcoin soon.

A site like that would be obsolete as soon as eBay starts accepting bitcoins - which they likely will or they'll become obsolete.  I think the best website/businesses in the future Bitcoin space will be the ones that figure how to use its other features; contract recording, loans and insurance, etc..

This Verge article is worth a read "In my opinion ... for Bitcoin to fulfill its promise as a global currency, global transaction network, and global remittance network, the monetary base will need to be a lot higher than $10 billion."  Agreed.
They say, however, that volatility makes merchants hesitant to adopt it, which is quite silly without mentioning that merchants can convert bitcoin orders to dollars right away if need be.  This "volatility" as a barrier is a convenient talking point but it has no real merit in actual practice.
Besides, things like SnapCard allow the purchase of ANYTHING with bitcoin and the merchant gets dollars.
The real boom to bitcoin will occur when the "need" for merchants to cash out for dollars goes away.  That level of adoption will be mega and it's coming, slowly but surely.
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:34:26
I think we need to start thinking about a Bitcoin economy that never needs users to convert to USD to get our daily needs.
As such, I'm working on a BTC platform for food barter (grocery, local, restaurant, and perhaps labor).  A barter platform like this would also allow the sale of raw milk and other food and supplement contraband. IM me if you want to contribute to this project...
Additionally, as NY cracks down on AirBnB rentals, that industry is coming under threat from tax junkies.  Perhaps a BTC version of AirBnB could take off...

Dumbest babble yet about bitcoin.  The article states that all other private currencies failed because they could be easily counterfeited and the gov'ts stepped in to prevent "fraud".  
Anyway, the point about "century’s worth of accumulated state power, jealously guarded and ruthlessly enforced" is a notable one.
