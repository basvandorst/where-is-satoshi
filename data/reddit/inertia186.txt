Person A makes a $1,000 purchase with person B.  Then, the price of BTC rises.  Person B violates the contract.  You think the courts will rule that Person B now owes person A whatever the price of BTC is at that point, in order to make person A whole from the point of sale.  So now, person B has to come up with, say, $400,000.  Multiply that times the number of contracts.
I have trouble believing the courts would rule that way.  I have no faith in the courts.  I think they might rule $1,000 and apply some punitive amount, but nowhere near the remaining $399,000.  And they'll call it good.
Over time, as USD weakens, the implied "bitcoin clauses" in contracts will go from being functionally illegal to illegal.  This is because the courts are USD centric.

That's why contracts in gold are *functionally* illegal.  Just to make it easier on the courts.
EDIT: Changed my phrasing from "illegal" to "functionally illegal."  It might be legal on paper, and you won't get in trouble *having* a gold clause in your contract, good luck collecting.  I'm sure the courts will rule in terms of USD.

Ultimately, it's been good for me that Coinbase has a haywire risk robot that has cancelled every single buy I've made since December.  Yes, there were some sweet prices that I has to miss, but it has forced me to look at other methods.
Maybe Coinbase is good for most people, but once the risk robot flags your account, you're sunk.  As volume and attention rises, more and more people will have these problems too.

At the moment, quantum computers are like arranging pins with a bulldoser.  So maybe there will be a time when high end quantum computers are available to the government and not the rest of society.

I don't think very many "hoarders" have the stamina to resist not whittling down their stake.  In other words, I don't think there are very many true hoarders out there.  I think we are confusing hoarders with hold-outs.  Some of them are holding out so that they can pay off their entire mortgagee in one swoop.  Stuff like that.  There's a price, and they'll sell once it's close to their price.

More like Thursday.  And it's always been like this.  Some mainstream exchanges (I forget, Hong Kong?) will actually close their exchange for lunch to smooth out the day.  Any exchange could impose hiatus to prevent a mini-liquidity crisis, but I doubt any bitcoin exchange will.  It much easier for mainstream exchanges to do this because they have what amounts to a cartel.  Any bitcoin exchange that attempts to impose a trade hiatus will just lose customers.
I think you're right, that once more people realize they can take advantage of these periods, they may smooth out over time, as long as nothing else goes wrong over these given weekends.

In the US, in the days when silver was commonly used as a means of trade, "hoarders" were people who were widely blamed for deflation.  In reality, they were just a scapegoat for the status quo, but that didn't matter.  Once their silver was "liberated," inflationary policy could go unchecked.

Yes, that is an important function as well.  I know a vast majority of users probably don't know what PGP is, but that really isn't an excuse.
I have given MtGox a new e-mail address and created a filter to mark all e-mails to the old address as likely phishing attempts (or at least 99% likely spam).
Gmail users, you can set a wildcard to achieve the same.  If your gmail address is abc you can give MtGox something like abc+123  It will still reach your regular inbox.
If you already use a wildcard with MtGox, change it again.

He'd have to use several dark pools.  If he doesn't use a dark pool, early trades will see the massive volume and bid down.  If he does use a dark pool, no one pool has enough volume to accommodate 300,000.  Once the early trades happen, the counter-party will try to cash in again, also causing massive volume and a bid up, tempting the original guy to become tempted to exit the dark pool trades.
In other words, trying 300,000 all at once would be noticed and ultimately cause the price to fall, which is actually a good thing because it will likely make this trade slow.  If it doesn't then a lot of people will have a chance to get in at a lower price.
Yes, it can always result in panic selling, of course but none of this is manipulation.  It is how free markets are supposed to work.  I think the falls will be sudden (it has happened to BTC before) but the rebounds will be glorious.

I have a different take.
**Confirmed:** All account names were released to the public, which we already knew. The passwords were hashed (and most were salted, salt itself supposedly not released). The folks at MtGox said the original hack itself happened ... *last freaking week!* They are getting reamed over that fact alone. This alone explains why it went as low as $13 last week.
**Root Cause:** MtGox says that they hired an unnamed security audit firm and that this firm was compromised. Why this firm had access to user data hasn't been explained. What kind of privacy policy is this?
**Damage:** MtGox seems to have allowed up to about 200 BTC to get stollen. MtGox is going to lock down the accounts until you log in and re-authenticate.
**Response:** They're rethinking how they hash the passwords and who they'll hire for audits in the future. I think the response that has most people concerned is the "rollback" they're planning to do on suspicious trades. They're also flushing the open orders, which means they're going to bracket asks/bids to prevent wild bids (like at 1¢). It's a very interesting situation by itself.
**Alternatives:** [TradeHill]( is a competitor that started up about 11 days ago. They're getting a lot of attention as result of the MtGox hack.
And the bottom line, nobody is asking the "taxpayer" to bail anybody out. Well done, free market! Everybody's worried about their reputations and keeping everybody happy. FTW!
All this from their interviews.  I'm happy with the information as conveyed.  I would love it if OnlyOneTV would get their act together in the tech area, but I'm happy with the information as gathered.  I certainly couldn't do better.

It happened in late 2008 the same way.  When the credit default swaps started to get called in, demand for the dollar skyrocketed.  The solution was to quickly end "mark to market" and this plugged the hole temporarily.
So whatever dollar-based trading instrument they are playing with today, perhaps dollar-based dark pools or some other dollar-based mechanism they invent, the same thing will happen.  People who have obligations in dollars will need those dollars in a hurry.  This will cause massive selloffs of equities and everything else, and naturally, the dollar demand will increase once again, briefly.
I think we'll see BTC fall to 3¢ for that brief time.  That's just my speculation.  Take it or leave it.  I think BTC is a safe place to park your wealth.  But looking back at it after the dust settles on the up-coming crisis, there will be lost opportunity during the dollar demand spike.

Ironically, super paranoid .onion sites are usually very diligent to remove all non-onion URLs.  It doesn't look like TorBroker feels the need to be super paranoid, which turns out to be a problem.
The reason is, TorBroker isn't offering a service that is considered outright illegal, in very many places, anyway.  If they want to offer this service, they should approach it as being the most illegal service imaginable and go from there rather than be reactive to each exploit as they are reported.

Maybe a better way to look at it is that USD is *enforced* by Pentagon.  BitCoin isn't enforced by anything, and that's the way I like it.  It's voluntary.
Backing implies "If I give you this, you are obligated to give me that."  It doesn't work with dollar.
"If I give you USD, you are obligated to give me Pentagon."
... or BitCoin ...
"If I give you BTC, you are obligated to give me The People."
Those don't make sense at all, but enforcement makes sense with USD.
"If you won't do business in USD, eventually resistance will result in my use of Pentagon against you."
... but with BitCoin, it doesn't make sense ...
"If you won't do business in BTC, eventually resistance will result in my use of The People against you."
Thus, BitCoin is voluntary ...
"If you won't do business in BTC, that's your choice.  I bid thee well.  Will you take LTC?"
A currency with a backing is illusory.  Any backing requires cooperation with government.  Obviously that is the case with government currency (if there is any kind of backing at all).  But it is also the case with privately issued currencies as well.  If government allows a private currency that is backed by something to exist, it can.  But it is at the whim and desecration of government.  Once government decides that private (centralized) currency is a threat, it's gone, regardless of its backing.
BitCoin has a chance of breaking the government whim paradigm.  I am hopeful, anyway.

On my first attempt at verification, one of the document photos didn't meet with their approval, so my verification got rejected.  I updated the document and resubmitted.
They rejected it a second time because of the first document.  They didn't delete the offending document and they don't give the user that option either.
I even told them that they were considering a document that they already rejected, no reply.
So it was a long time before they ever got around to letting me verify.  Eventually they did.  They're just swamped and in a huge hurry with everything.  But still.

I'm not here to sell you on Litecoin, but consider this.  When the weekend comes, there is often a "dollar shortage" that impacts Bitcoin because banks aren't transferring.  The slowness of the dollar makes some people panic and can temporarily impact the price of Bitcoin through this silly dollar demand the banks (inadvertently) make.
I believe Litecoin will smooth that out by providing another form of liquidity during the temporary dollar shortages.  It may not be a lot right now, but there are a lot of people who think they missed the Bitcoin train and are now focused on Litecoin.
It's even possible that last weekend's Bitcoin (relative) stability was due to Litecoin already, but that could have been a coincidence.

I don't know about this specific problem.  But any show stopper anyone can come up with will be mitigated by the fact that Bitcoin is voluntary to use.
If there are enough road blocks, there's always Litecoin.  In that situation, it will iron itself out.  If less people use Bitcoin and seek an alternative, problems created by its own popularity will be solved.
So if problems created by its own popularity go unaddressed, it's self correcting.  If the developers try to solve problems by doing something even more unpopular, this will also affect its own popularity, solving the problem.
It all hinges on Bitcoin being voluntary.  As long as there's a risk of flight away from Bitcoin, I'm not worried.

Umm. No.  If even one address can be cracked in polynomial time, all that does is prove all of them can be cracked and the whole thing falls apart.
Quantum computers will not be a threat for a very long time.  And leading up to that point, quantum computers will first be used for mining.  So if you ever see an unexplained jump in difficulty, then it's time to maybe consider worrying.  Even then, it has to be a real hockey-stick.

Finally.  Some examples of "government bullying."


Ok, so these are good "wut if" scenarios.  They are all semi-plausible.  And nothing is a better bogeyman than semi-plausible.
I think forced packet sniffing is the most likely.  If it happens in the US, it won't be overt.  It'll be part of a comprehensive anti-terror algorithm black-box that ISPs may "voluntarily" install.  If they do install it, they'll get a government seal on their web site, certifying to their customers they comply with these voluntary measures.  And anyone who avoids using these ISPs will be "helping the terrorists."  Bitcoin need not be singled out or even mentioned, but the black-box will flag and/or block bitcoinish packets as well as a huge number of other patterns.
What will the impact be on Bitcoin?  Almost none.  It'll be easy to sidestep.  The main thing government wants is "security theater*" even if it doesn't actually do anything.
    * See: TSA
Banks regulating transactions seems like it'd have a little more impact.  But I think it'd be hard to make it harder to buy Bitcoin than it is now.  I'm not an expert in banking stuff, but if it did get harder to use more traditional methods, I think more innovative methods will come along.  And these methods will just leave the mainstream channels behind.  Of course, this will hurt Bitcoin growth.  But it will benefit Bitcoin too.  How?
Less possibility of mainstream adoption means it'll be like it is now for longer: Used by mostly neckbeards and hipsters.  This isn't ideal, but it's like getting a low profile.  Mainstream adoption will stress Bitcoin in ways we can't imagine.  It will hold up.  But if we don't have to stress it right away, that's not a bad thing either.
So, last one is taxing merchants who use Bitcoin.  That would be an interesting tax code.  If it's too specific, and it only applies to Bitcoin, then it'll create interest for cashing out in other blockchains out here like Litecoin.  If the tax code is too general, it will run the risk of being applied to non-monetary algorithms.  If the tax code is specific to blockchain technologies only, then it'll create an opportunity for another kind of crypto-currency.

This is actually somewhat interesting.  Normally, in a martingale betting strategy, you risk your entire bankroll hoping against the possibility of a small string of losses.  It's actually fairly easy to bankrupt.
But this "parabolic" strategy offers lossless rolls up to 25 and lossy resistance from 26 on.  In other words, if you're really unlucky and find yourself with 50+ losses in a row, you risk 10 BTC and lose only 1 BTC if you finally win on the 52nd roll.
Or risk 20 BTC, only lose 2 BTC if you roll 58 losses and finally win on 
I'm sure there are examples of 100+ straight losses, too.  In fact, it's to be expected.  Thus, in the long run you still lose more than you win, but it's an interesting approach.

Sure, I think there will be resistance, but Molyneux's analogy of the combustion engine is very good.  How many people in the status quo before the combustion engine realized that this device was going to put them out of business?

BitCoin is back-door-anarchy.  I don't mean back-door-chaos.  I mean "an-archy" as in "no (need for) (centralized) authority," which is what the word literally refers to, disguised as a cute innocent currency alternative.

You have an understandable concern.  It is difficult to answer your questions without getting technical.
But basically, the code in  is published publicly and signed.  If it did anything weird, it would have to be out in the open and subject to public scrutiny.  And it doesn't do anything weird.  It's safe.
However, what cannot be assured is your own computer doing anything weird or not.  If you have any malware that is bitcoin aware, you're at risk, whether you know it or not.
There are several tools for importing a paper wallet when that time comes.  One of them is blockchain.info.
