It's irrelevant though at the point of starting proceedings, stuff like that comes out in court. If you want to press criminal charges and the police are reasonably sure you are not off your rocker (i.e you are not trying to get Obama arrested for multiple homicides) they have to investigate. How they investigate is up to them i.e what priority etc.
Now you hand them a nice gift wrapped package of "evidence" that you spent millions gathering and are supposedly a responsible organization then what do you think they are likely to do? They have to follow through and let the lawyers and the courts decide it.
Like i said unless you are talking specifically about wikileaks and a handful of others then this statement doesn't really apply.

The bulk of advanced electronics (consoles, pc's, smartphones etc) require things that are mined in regions such as the DR Congo. Per Wikipedia:


So maybe your kit might not contain any Coltan mined from a warzone but the drive for it for consumer electronics is funding one of the most deadliest wars.
Notice the two dates when it was at its 10% peak, they line up with the release dates of the PS2 and 2nd gen iPhone and other models of premium Smartphones. When something electronic is in great demand people don't tend to care.

No one tells you not to take a dump on the floor either, you just don't do it. If you are running a business these things are assumed, that you are repeatedly showing how you don't get this just further reinforces my thinking that your "business" is just completely off the books buying and selling. Nothing wrong with that but don't call it one thing when it is the other. 
When you run a business there is little hand holding like when you get personal accounts etc because you are have a lot more legal and regulatory responsibilities then you would as an employee.


Good for you, this is not an option to a lot of people though. Even then it still has to be up to building codes etc so make sure you keep evidence for that around. You seem to have a real aversion to paperwork, yes it sucks but as a business owner you have to do it.

Gox was in the crap when he did it as well. IIRC they had already suspended things like OKPay withdrawls and were only allowing BTC withdrawls blaming "the bank" for only letting them do a few real money transfers a day.
Right up until it shut people were insisting Gox was fine with people buying "Goxcoins" for cheap, these were BTC stuck in gox that people bought the rights to if they came out. Needless to say they never did.

The U.S never had much to do with ISIS in the area, except rounding up all it's leaders and grunts and sticking them in one big POW camp for yeas for them to formulate the plan...
Other countries have been accused of funding ISIS, mainly Saudi Arabia and Turkey and then cutting funding when they realized what it had become. 
There are many groups operating in Syria and Iraq. Most western aid is going to more established groups like the Peshmagra (the defacto police of North Iraq  since gulf war 1) and others.
ISIS have very little beyond running a permanent blitzkrieg (there initially source of funding was robbing iraqi banks) and hate other Muslim groups more then westerners. ISIS are even at war with al queda as they see them as sell outs!
If anyone is forcing an ISIS vs Assad fight it is the Russians or are mainly bombing anti Assad rebels and doing a few token strikes on ISIS.

Ah a classic history comment. The hyperinflation of the 20's was caused by many things primarily That France had acted like such a douche at the negotiating table and took a chunk of German industry and demanded huge reparations to be paid by a country that lost the war more through a failing economy then militarily (which is what Hitler rode in on).
When Germany failed to meet the reparations(which were pretty much impossible), it had a cyclical effect on European countries and then the U.S causing the big crash. 
Even Foch on seeing the Treaty of Versaille said(paraphrasing a bit as going from memory) "This is not an armistices it is a ceasefire for 20 years". He was a year out if you class WWII as when Germany invaded Poland or a year or two early if you class things like annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia.

The hardware is useless unless you want a poor miner locked to a specific pool attached to a cheap pi that doesn't even have a case for $400.
Oh and there is no proof that there chips are actually mining. You can't point them at another pool and the mining rewards come from a buffered pool anyway(which is why it gives you way more then it earned when first turned on).

Okay let me try this again. You are asking the bank TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU and you don't bring in the most basic of business documents because you were not asked is there fault? The onus is on you, they didn't remind you to keep breathing either. These things are stuff you are supposed to do when you run a business.


And that has squat to do with anything. Like i said i was in the bank in a KMFDM T-shirt and white combats and was treated the same as a ceo in a suit because i could prove where my money came from. You don't like that they treated you suspecious because you had a large amount of money and no proof of source beyond your story without any backing up. That is like first day on the job "How to spot suspicious transactions 101" level.


Guess what they are going to do when you want a mortgage or a car loan etc.
Also do you have any paperwork? Because now would be a good time to start if you don't and LTD\LLC's let you minimize tax legally more then if you are self employed.
End of the day you asked them to do business with you and despite being almost a 100% fit for suspecious funds they still did. Now lets say two people ring you up wanting to sell an audio doodad:
 is some guy who has dug it out the attic and shoots the breeze a while about how they used to be all the rage. He knows a bit about the price but has way to high an idea so you give him market rate and he accepts. He also has no problem filling out a reciept for your records (you are getting those right)
 Has the doodad and a few random cables, asks you how much it is worth and looks strung out. You try to talk to him about audio gear but he has no clue about it yet has this rare doodad. You low ball him a ridiculous offer and he accepts. Then when it comes to paperwork he gets all shady with you
One of these doodads is stolen which one is it most likely to be?

Just because you don't agree with something (as evidenced by your calling everyone involved with it "left wing") does not make it irrelevant. 
The EU has had the effect of forcing some countries to bring in things such as maternity\paternity leave that they would not have done otherwise. The exact same thing is true of the 48 hour work week to the point the UK fought it tooth and nail until it got a volunteer get out clause.
The EU ensures that all member states have a certain level of human rights and social welfare which comes under "most or the best work for fraternity between nations" by bringing a common framework to many different distinct and historically separate cultures and nations. Who also have spent the best part of history blowing holes in each other.

Thanks for your reply. I asked in the main shadowban sub at the time and was told by cupcake i was banned for vote brigading . At the time the only two subs i ever really voted on were here and and it definitely was not from and IIRC it was mentioned it was for this sub but i can't remember to be sure.
I've been on the net long enough to remember the famous Compuserve user quote, the gist of it is we become the content that companies sell to make a profit. So when my old account was banned i used a greasemonkey script to thoroughly nuke everything i had ever done including several very useful posts in various subs.
I really could not give a damn about the account but given reddit is all about voting and things to basically drop a nuke on my head without warning seems far too much. Especially as the rules state that brigading is an organized activity and i was voting independently.
As to it can be a circlejerk too but in all honsesty if people stopped doing stupid things like claiming bitcoin will be the national currency in 2016 because reasons or even this "lets make people ~~wear yellow triangles~~ have flair showing their allegiances" then there really would not be a A bit of self awareness would go a hell of a long way in the bitcoin world.

The NHS is not state theft. It was enacted by the elected government of the day, in fact it was one of the main reasons that government were elected booting out Churchill who had just won WW2.
Any government since that has tried to take the NHS away has either been booted or scaled back plans because it is what the majority of the people want. If you live in a democracy by definition you go with what the majority want.

In the UK they have a pretty odd definition of theft which is basically to take something from the owner with the intention of PERMANENTLY depriving them of it.
So most care thefts are charge as TWOC's (taken without owners consent) rather then straight up theft because by abandoning a stolen car you don't permanently deprive the owner of it.

They have access to them through API calls. There is nothing stopping paypal and others from letting an API call authorize and then spend and move money freely. They chose not to because it would be a security nightmare.


Or buy a $25 gift card and load it into paypal, still cheaper then a PiTato. Any financial API can allow machines to machine transactions they are just untrustworth so they really on the final step of human auth.
When you buy something from paypal with say opencart, your store says to paypal "username X whats to buy Product Y, QTY 1 is this OK" Paypal gives a luanch screen, presents that data with you and you click "OK". Paypal then sends pack "transaction confirmed by us buddy, your are good to go".

Did you read the META-study before copy and pasting an excerpt from the abstract?
Like the bits it says:


WHO recommend 1.5mg/L.
Or that there was no control for other contaminants (iodine, arsnic). There is also another paper showing that low dose is bad but did not meet the criteria for the meta study:


Not to mention that the IQ score was an **estimate**


Leaving aside the fact that IQ is a pretty crap measure whose goalposts have had to be moved multiple times (like when it needed an overhaul for women where it was classing everyone as barely functional)


It is a meta review (a paper reviewing other papers) that concludes that there be something (there may be not) and further research is required because the data available contains confounders which could be fudging the findings.
Then to top it all off you realize fluoridation occurs naturally and water is usually only artificially fluoridated to compensate in area's where the natural level is lower? The EPA is even looking at dropping the limit down to 0.7 which **would stop artificial fluoridation because the water would be at that level naturally**

Once again people in this sub bitch about banks when the problem is the way they approach them. If his business was legitimate in anyway he could prove it no matter how he was dressed.
When i got my business bank account opened I was wearing a KMFDM t-shirt and white combats with 5.11 boots. I was taken to a private office offered coffee, cake etc and had to show my company details and passport for I.D. Took about 30 mins for business account + business credit card for myself and one other person.
Odd what happens when you have a way to prove the money is yours and your not acting in the same way they have been trained to spot drug dealers and money mules isn't it?
If you don't want to make life easy for yourself then don't complain. You are asking them to do business with you, they have every right to turn you down so i don't se why he is so upset given he had no records to show that money was legitimate and was asking questions which:
A) The branch staff would not know the answer to, fraud detection is down in the back end.

Are you dense? That is how democracy works. You can just as easily say if everyone votes for ultra-capitalists then someone who is a die hard communist is forced at the barrel of a gun. They are not.


Welcome to democracy, again this cuts both ways. If you don't like it vote against it, if enough people vote against it then it does not pass.
While your talking about gun barrels you might want to look into all the defense contracts that were cancelled by Labour through the 60's &amp; 70's. Also how various people from the business &amp; aristocracy communitys plotted to overthrow a democratically elected government because they didn't like the way it was going. So who was forcing who at gunpoint?


Yes they do. They are called Co-operatives and there is a pretty big one in the UK called (imaginatively) "The Co-Op". Again under a socialist government there is nothing stopping you from forming a company that gives value back to shareholders only. Funny how most EU nations have flipped between various government types since the 50's yet still have the same industries and financial centers...

They did and got " I sell doodads on eBay". What they would be expecting is "here is my accounts for the last 3 months, i can get more if you would like and here is my tax return for the previous year"
Laws likely vary by state but a quick wiki search gives:


So given your sales claims you should have had one of those 1040-ES copies to show that you are legitimate and not operating as a cah in hand type. You also should be keeping your accounts in order and could have gone in with a YTD overview.
Instead you turn up with a pocket full of bills and no history other then your story and wonder why they might think something funny is going on. Providing basic business documentation when dealing with a financial entity doesn't usually need to be explained, it is kind of assumed you will bring it with you just as a normal person would bring payslips or proof of address etc.

You don't get it at the moment various financial apis have calls that basically say " I want you to send $50 from John Smith to industries order 1234"
At this point John Smith is then made to log in to see the transaction and click accept at which point it will say "Johm Smith agrees to send industries $50 for order 1234"
You can drop that middle authentication step at any time but how do you prove John Smith wanted to send the money to industries? maybe he sets his fridge to top up his milk when it is low and to auto buy with permission granted, hey he even limits it to a$2 limit? Cool that means tomorrow i do an API call "John smith wants to send NotHyplon industries $2" "OK you are pre approved, sending". Then i loop it through $2 at a time.
John Smith claims I tried to rob him, I claim his fridge made those API calls. Do you see the problem here? having a user login and validate a transaction puts responsibility of the transaction on someone. M2M transactions are a great vector for fraud, money laundering and allsorts of financial shenanigans.

And here we have exhibit A folks:




How can you tell me what i do and do not like you idiot? You can't say i don't like bitcoin more then i can say that you like jacking off to pictures of donald trump covered in peanut butter.
I have 3 antminer S1's running currently. I made a small fortune in arbitrage between gox and btc-e during the bubble as well as cashing out a lot. I have made some regular beer money shorting on bitfinex riding the weekly up and down that happens as DNM users get their market orders in then stop over the weekend.
I have also made money through my company buying in bulk miners from China and selling on eBay. Why would i hate something that has been financially beneficial? The fact i don't believe it is the answer to every question is the exact same way I feel about my toaster, it rocks at making toast, it sucks at doing data analysis.




Right so it is only going to end SOME war's not all war. That makes it a much more sensible and rational statement... You seem to think all taxation will dry up, guess what? It won't. Tax has existed for thousands of years in one form or another and will continue to do so. Death and taxes are the only things you can guarantee in life.


Is there one saying it will make you all rich? Or have there been more scams, losses, bubbles and what not enough to keep both and busy? Bitcoin has been around 6 years, has a single bitcoin company been around that long without getting involved in a lawsuit/scam/shady dealings?


Indeed. Oddly though they don't tend to talk about it on old airplane subs where someone decided to launch [a bitcoin tirade at me]( or when i made a post on where i said:


Which earned me a place on some lunatics "troll watch" sub. 
There is a big difference between discussing bitcoin and OMGZ LOOK GREECE IS DYING LETS GET THEM USING BITCOIN SO WE CAN BE RICH then downvoting anyone that points out that the transaction limit makes this impossible.
As for missionaries can fill you in on what it is like having the same people ask you weekly to accept bitcoin. The constant online nagging of people to accept bitcoin and then not ordering and was pitchforked and ostracized for saying bitcoin provided hardly any sales. Even Mozilla's A/B testing was criticized.
A Brazilian Professor was doxxed for being a member of and accused of indoctrinating his students against it with no evidence. I have posted multiple times since they showed up how purse.io is a scam and been downvoted to oblivion for it yet there are people being raided by the police because of it.


Well here is a good one how about despite being told multiple times to piss off from people stop trying to preach over there? How about building useful goods and services rather then all being idea's men? How about not providing a textbook example of why deflation is bad (HODL)?
Also for the second time I do not hate bitcoin, I hate bitcoiners people like yourself who are so presumptuous you think you can tell others what they think. So thanks for providing a perfect example of the  lunatic segment compared to others who have responded to me politely and reasonably  in this sub.

TCP has a theoretical max of 64kb for a packet size, not sure why you think this is important given the nature of the protocol but anyway it is a moot point as most network devices have a maximum MTU of 1500 bytes by default (for ethernet).

claimed the government didn't care with the internet when most of the worlds governments were activley devloping the infrastructure, protocls and things that would end up being used.
Also that comparing Bitcoin at X point to the internet at X point is a flawed analogy. It is like saying that someone is trying to keep electric cars down and that Tesla is like the road network in 1995.
As you mentioned WWW is a service running over the internet with bitcoin and others running on top of that. How then can people compare a service running on top of a service to the infrastructure underneath it all.
If people want to make a comparison it should be Bitcoin vs WU or Bitcoin vs Paypal/Skrill/ all the similar ones. This is never done though because Paypal went from zero to massive adoption in 5 years whilst bitcoin went from zero to poor adoption (Dell, overstock and a couple of others) unless you count DNM's which most of the crowd treat as an elephant in the room

The wording is different to what you would get for a business account letter. Banks are required by UK and EU regulations to ensure that they take all steps possibke to prevent money laundering, criminal transactions, funding of terroism etc.
Have a read through these:
To a bank someone trading bitcoins either through exchanges or on localbitcoins through a PERSONAL account looks a lot like someone money laundering either intentionally or unintentionally (money muleing). This then flags up as a risk and OP basically told them he was operating as a money exchanger as well.
If he had a business account the banks rarely intervene because they know your business area and can see if you are a retailer money is going backwards and forwards between You, Suppliers and Customers. If they want to dig deeper they can then ask and you show them your records. 
On a business account you pay fee's for the banking service and have much more regulatory expectations placed on your business. Personal accounts in the UK are free and have Terms and Conditions which this guy likely broke. If they turn a blind eye then the bank is at risk of failing on various compliance checks.

Most of the time governments and private companies are separate, there are exceptions like Guatemala in the 50's. Private companies can lobby and get there voices heard but they can only lobby the people YOU elect to office.
If you want to see the power the ordinary vote has look up UK politics and the rise of UKIP (who want the UK out of Europe) who are gaining rapid support as a fourth party in the traditionally three party system.
If you vote A or B you will get A or B. You know what A or B will do but you vote them in anyway because to do anything else is "wasting your vote" which is utter tripe. 
Elections these days are run on number crunching, if they saw a key demographic defectin to "The Bitcoin Party" they would make manifesto changes in much the same way the Conservatives in the UK (think U.S Republicans-lite) are changing attitudes to Europe to stop voters defecting to UKIP.
The same thing happened with the Scottish Independence vote. Scotland may have lost independence but now has much more power heading its way.
If you moan and whinge that they will never change then they won't. If people want to vote for someone that does the opposite to you then you are outvoted. It sucks but the majority disagree with you and the needs of the many and all that jazz
American's are the worse for this. They moan about a police state etc but have elected posts all the way down. Hunter S Thompson was nearly voted Sheriff FFS. Most countries get to vote on a local council and one or two national representatives + EU MEP's if EU states. Americans can vote for so many public post's yet still vote red or blue.
If he doesn't like it run for office even local council. Every vote he receives is a poke in the eye to any major political party as they are watching polls like hawks more then ever. If you keep voting them back in to do the same old shit they will do the same old shit.

You and me have different success criteria. To me Bitcoin is already a success for what it is an anonymous way of sending cryptocyrrency fast. If you vision of success takes the form of shutting down all banks whilst simultaneous;ly becoming rich of of 10 coins then good luck to you but it ain't going to happen.
Look at the cluster fuck that is the EURO with the the UK and Sweden not going ahead despite massive pushes from all other EU states. Now tell me some purely electronic psudo anonymous thing is going to achieve that level of saturation? 
Maybe, just Maybe if it was released 10 years+ earlier when the wall Cyberpunk wars were going on and people were smuggling OpenPGP source out on books will it have gained a niche. It is like saying a Ford Taurus is a good car, it gets you from A-B therefore every car should be a Taurus.
As someone pointed out unless battery storage tech reaches some advanced state electric cars are going nowhere beyond their niche. They are not laughed at anymore mainly because Tesla build proper cars an not oversize golf buggies. For the foreseeable future the IC engine will still rule.
Same with self drive, infact i would no want a self drive my car has 3 electronic driver aids, ABS, power steering and EBC. That is all a car i want to drive should have.

Try buying something big like a house. You have to prove I.D, show proof of employment, bank history and explain where your deposit came from (for mortgage).
Most countries have an amount for cash transactions where above a point they have to be declared (10k usd) and other legal rules applied.


Aside from the mistakes others have picked up they do regulate software. PGP was subject to munitions control as it was classed as a weapon in terms of export out of the U.S. They got around that by printing it's source code as a book (1st amendment FTW) flying it to Europe and rescanning it.
The code for DVD encryption was a similar thing (DeCSS? i think) so a guy wrote a song about it. Even now if you get software images for things such as enterprise routers there are different versions to take into account the export controls on encryption.
I would imagine technically if you sent someone a Linux install DVD to Iran or North Korea you could be done for arms trading unless it was a gimped version with all the good security protocols removed.

No they are being asked to play by the same rules.
Just like it would be fair to say that SUV's should not have been classed as "light trucks" to get around emissions laws.
The Legal High\RC scene find ways of tweaking illegal substances so that they are chemically different and therefore not illegal. They still remain illegal for human consumption though as unlicensed medicines. You do not hear them bitching they cannot sell Etizolam like Roche sells Valium. When the law finally catches up they move on.
Tesla's are electric powered but that does not grant them an exception from safety tests or high way speed limits. The list goes on.
Just because something is new does not mean it can be a special snowflake and expect its competitors to not point this out. Mastercard spend millions in compliance alone, most bitcoiners thing compliance is a selfie of you with your driving license.

North Korea is just as deadly as it was before, not much unless you are South Korea or maybe Japan.
The thing with North Korea is all anyone could do was threaten them. Anything else and China stepped in. Plus Korea does not lend itself well to fighting, they found that out in the 50's. Plus fuck all in resources
Whereas gulf states are nice and flat (mostly) which is tank/attack helicopter country and have lovely oil. Which is why Iraq was invaded for "WMD's" and the Norks asked nicely not to play with nukes.
ISIS is favored over South Sudan because they represent everything the media and governments  have been claiming since 9/11 - The evil caliphate that will kill your men folk and make everyone convert to their version of Islam at gunpoint.

Bulllshit! The Bitcoin businesses do not want to comply with the regulation or rules they would need to follow and so are refused service by banks. Any bank that did business with someone so openly flaunting th regulations is liable to be smacked hard by the auditers of the multiple industry standards they adhere to.
If they worked to the rules they would be allowed. Most don't even want to make any attempt at even looking into what sort of regulation they would need. PROTIP:KYC\AML is a teeny tiney part of it not all of it

Careful you don't cut yourself on that edge there.
Lets take it nice and slow. Society has a thing called laws, if you break said laws you get a punishment. These laws are made (usually) by people who are elected by the populous to represent them.
If you do not like said laws vote against the ppeople that make them or run for office yourself or something. Sure you can create your own mafia state if you can find some land that you can OWN that is not part of an existing country. Then get yourself recognised as an independant nation by the U.N and call your self "Grand Wizard of Bitcoinia". Then you can make what ever laws you like!

I said gold is a conductor, did i say gold wiring? it is a good conductor of electrictiy and heat. Even NASA use it on things like the lunar lander.


I never said they were. Gold is an investment and USD is a currency.


The current price of gold is reflected in its rareity and cost of extraction\production. If you think you can aquire it cheaper then good for you go tell the people having to build huge ass mines in Australia to extract ounces of the stuff.


Yeah I mean if nought 1 BTC last novemeber it would be $1000+ and is now worth $350ish. On December 8th it was at $379 then $335 on the 11th and now $350ish. Something that wanders up and down 10% in 4 days is not a good store of value.




No it wouldn't, it would only require the devs to do it, it would create a fork and like i said is unlikey to happen but is possible. Alchemy on the other hand is unlikely to ever create more gold.

Tell that to totes, RIP fellow AI!
What you call straight up trolling is not often trolling but pointing out blatant flaws in the circlekjerk. Like the recent DC build in progress that was a horror show, Xapo's week long outage, Localbitcoin sellers consistently getting PERSONAL accounts shut down because they are using them for business etc.
Then a few weeks back y'all went and had a full on McCarthy era red scare complete with bounty's on users but included one who was very pro bitcoin. People set up blatent scams (purse.io, cloudmining) or illegal businesses(cigarette importing) and when people point this out they get called trolls. Then one month later its " My Amazon account is under investigation for a carded voucher".
For such a "Honey Badger of Money" Bitcoin seems to need a lot of molly coddling from bad news. Most of the so called trolls round here actually use BTC, I have several miners myself yet you will find me posting in most business threads asking about compliance and being labelled a troll.
Any criticism gets labelled as trolling. Anything remotely positive even when a blatant scam gets upvoted and rewarded. I think I speak for many who actually like Bitcoin but Bitcoiners who try to make a square peg fit a round hole. I think this passage sums it up nicely as to why I personally stick around here though "The Hydrogen Sonata" by Iain M Banks really sum up the attitude here to &gt; However, there is another reaction to the never-ending plethora of unoriginal idiocies that life throws up with such erratic reliability, besides horror and despair.”

So you could say that around cryptocurrencys they are not meeting the requirements of  "DIRECTIVE 2005/60/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing"
That is a big no no and no UK bank will do anything with them unless they can prove they are fully compliant with Jersey, UK and EU laws and regulations. 
They may be licensed in Jersey but that does not mean they are up to code for UK banks. If you can't prove 100% then you are doomed as basically you are guilty until proven innocent as its up to them who they want to do business with.

You misunderstand, i said name a bitcoin business that could pass an audit not challenging you personally to name an audit.
Picking on coinbase because I had a discussion on here with about them in which he says he is making changes. In the past though there solution to store cold wallets was USB keys (THE worst form of backup) in bank safe deposit vaults. I somehow doubt that would pass any of the ISO audits. Also unless they are backing off credit card's and stuff they should be PCI-DSS compliant.
It can go on and on and i don't mean to pick on coinbase here but none of them are acting according to regulations or industry best practices and most seem to be delibrately making no attempt to become compliant. IIRC coinbase hired on a complaince officer recently so he is going to have his hands full.
No one wants to pay the fee's a BTC bank would need to comply with relevant regulations and laws but then moan when someone gets hacked. Its a catch-22 Bitcoin company invests in industry standard practices, passes the price to customer, customers go elswhere.

Much like the UFO scene as well what little information of general purpose gets buried under disinformation from both sides.
The documentary "Mirage men" (books better) covered it nicely including the part about how in 1987 one of the top guys in MUFON confessed to being fed information from government sources (IIRC). Also how one man Richard Doty was able to influence the current UFO craze to such an extent.
In Bitcoin you have people that believe a few people can do no wrong and are idolized like prophets yet time and time again they are caught out shilling for scams. Neo &amp; bee, purse etc.
What most call shit in here is often the information you don't like. This makes this sub as easy to control as the "true believers" of other things. So long as the idols back something it will be all ok. As for hoaxers, the bitcoin equivalent would be scammers and we all know how many of them there has been.
How about people stop acting like missionaries and put in the time to make Bitcoin what you want it to be whilst having some realistic expectations. It will not be the one world currency, it will not have a price tag of 1 million per coin.
It is useful for sending transactions instantly across the net, especially where such transactions run into issues with traditional payment processors. Mkae it better, make it more user friendly etc but at least accept the other side of the coin when someone disagrees it is not trolling. Much like someone can say UFO's are not Aliens but are still UFO's be they things like test planes, light tricks, ball lightning etc.

It's ok though because "Hyplon,Hyplon and Bit_Bubbly" are located next door and they fight for my legal rights by disrupting the legal process, or at least they did untill that whole "needing to pass the bar" bullshit. I pass the bar everyday at "Hyplons Liqour, Fireworks and handgun store" but they keep going on about licenses for that.

Wow that will go far if you hit someone. Also does it apply to your car payments system, because if you don't own that car outright there will be similar conditions. This is why dealers have different sections for fleet vs consumer.
A cab is acting as a registered commercial vehicle, an Uber driver is not. The cab will be insured for commercial use but also as part of a business i.e Statist Cab Co. If you get hit by one to the point insurance doesn't cover it then you can go after the parent company. Even owner/drivers can set up as a limited company and worse case the company goes bust not you personally.
In the same situation but as an Uber driver you are fucked and will be chased into bankruptcy. Limited companies really are a thing of beauty.
Also not sure how this works stateside but many countries require cabs and commercial vehicles to have roadworthy checks either more often or more stringently.
Just because the American Cab (and Union) system has led to such Nepotism and Cronyism does not make Uber the cure for it. Ultimately you are riding in some persons personal car with a third party that will disavow anything that happens. Even mini cabs in the UK are licensed better. I could go drive an Uber car now in D.C but if i tried a black cab in London without doing the knowledge the police would be the least of my worries.
This is not a black and white Cabs good, Uber Bad rant. There is a lot wrong with the American cab system but simply going around all the rules and regulations and saying lol those don't apply to me i am disrupting! Is not the answer either.

Only the ones that have people buy stuff for them on stolen cards. OP knowingly went to a site notorious for carding to save a few points on the dollar. Whatever way you cut it he received stolen goods, they were in his house therefore you get a warrant to enter the house and recover stolen goods.
Even if OP was totally naive about purse the same situation would have happened. They knew his address so they know where the stolen goods are. To enter they need a warrant (most EU countries are not as lax as the U.S on probable cause), they have the complaint from the CC provider, the complaint from the merchant and OP's address where he signed for the good delivery. Why wouldn't they issue a warrant?
Handling stolen goods is against the law in many nations. Their is nothing illegal about going into an Apple store and buying an iPhone at a 10% off sale. If you buy from a shady guy in a back alley an unboxed phone at super cheap rate though and it turns out stolen well your out of luck. You knew it was stolen, best case you lose the stolen object.

Lets see just how many golden rules of DC design they have broken:
* Hot/cold aisle - probably but only due to pointing miners one way with no division of airflow.
* Over stacked cabs - Each cab is pulling way more electricity then in a normal DC
* Cabs made of wood or metal garage shelving- Really? do i need to explain this one
* Wiring spider web - OK this is post fire but i see no cable trays and likely power and ethernet had been twist tied together
* Using non safety approved kit - They have FCC, CE etc marks that are real and not just stickers
* No false ceiling to assist in partition of hot/ cold aisles
* Basing in a freaking barn
* No fire suppression system ( a Chinese guy with a extinguisher does not count)
and thats just the very basics, what about access control etc. Also who wants to bet the whole thing ran off a single linkysys/other home modem on the end of multiple switches?

You really are dense aren't you? Amazon will notice the CC charge backs, link them to the gift code used and file a complaint. They also have data mining up the wazoo so will spot this much quicker then other companies.
Stolen CC's have a short life time so what people have been doing is buying Amazon gift codes and selling them on purse for a profit. As soon as the ripped off person notices the charges they get them refunded (yay Visa\Mastercard). The merchant is now out stock and money but guess what they have all your details from the shipping and i'm sure the nice friendly police officer will take all this down and stick it on the to do pile as a slam dunk.

I use one of my vehicles 95% personal use but if I use it to go to/from a customer site that is classed as business use because most insurers cover commuting to/from your "usual place of work" or similar. So it needs business insurance.

If you want Bitcoin to succeed the price should be irrelevant. What most people on this sub do not get is more mainstream adoption = lower price not the other way around.

The same goes with regulation. You can have mass adoption or no regulation, you can't have both.

Oh they know all right. Want to scare anyone at a bank, two words "Compliance Audit". Just because he has no clue about the various EU and UK laws and regulations around the finance industry does not mean they are making them up as they go along.
AML\KYC is a teeny weeny part of the big picture and is not enough to satisfy EU laws on money laundering. From a technical standpoint banks will need to see things like:
* PCI-DSS compliance if you go anywhere near a credit or debit card
* Proper and vetted anti-fraud processes
* Minimum SLA's on ALL hardware (probably applies to software as well but not my area) for vendor support
* Some form of ISO compliance
* Proof that data is safe (comes with ISO compliance but still)
That is not even including the clusterfuck of things they ask to hook into the network.

No it means if you have a hacked CC you use it to get gift cards that you can then liquidate through a convenient service run by people either incredibly naive or lying through thier teeth. A hacked CC number has a very short life span so you convert to gift codes that have a longer life span (until Amazon link the CC charge back to the codes)

Which means you are likely using it in a purpose it is not insured for and so do not have valid insurance even though you are using it for good deeds. Just like if your an Uber driver you can't use your normal drivers insurance.

If you get busted trying to rob 300 Euro's worth of stuff from a store and get caught the cops catch you+ stuff no need to do anything else.
In this case they need to enter the residence to recover the stolen goods. Plus if this is not OP's first time at the rodeo they can might have 3 or 4 complaints against him from other people he scammed via purse. TBH the amount you have stolen is irrelevant if they know you have stolen\illegal goods inside, if they can prove it easily (which in this case they have his address on the fraudulant order) it will get signed off. The warrent might be for seizure of the items and related things, possible bye bye to OPs computer!
Plus it might be related to a wider investigation of purse purchases that come back as chargebacks. Only takes a bit of data mining by the CC companies to find common links with purse transactions i.e usually ordered by males buying tech products etc.
EDIT: Remembere this is not straight up theft. They can go down the Identity theft route (using someone elses card), International theft (if the original card is not in the same country as OP), Conspiracy to commit fraud, Aquiring goods through fraud etc etc

I'm curious as to why people think this is a useful analogy when it really isn't.
The internet is infrastructure, bitcoin is a service that runs over said infrastructure. Just like roads are infrastructure and cars are things that use the infra structure, or to push it further Armoured Trucks that deliver money carry wealth across the infrastructure.
This analogy is so often repeated and so flawed. If your going to compare to something in the early 'net days compare to Gopher, Napster, Flooz, Beenz, Kazaa, Gnuettella etc. All seperate services that run over the internet.
People compare to Email but not to the multitude of IM clients and protocols that have come and gone?  
Also not many people scoffed at email, most scoffed at the "paperless office" concept becasue that had been touted since the 70's and still we have not reached it yet.
Email, Usenet etc were no harder to operate back in the 90's then the operating systems underlying the machines. If you could work Windows 3.11/95 you could send an email. AOL &amp; Compuserve even had there super dumbed down versions that anyone with an IQ higher then a lawn dart could use.

You know the last batch of BTC auctioned was Ulbricht's personal seized coins right? The USMS agreed so it locked in the value so if he loses  they get cold hard cash and if he wins he gets the cash back.

Thing is if the cops raid you for selling drugs and they find $100,000 and a kilo of coke they take it all as evidence and stick it in a lock up. Then if it turns out that $100k you got for just selling a rare pokemon card or something and not the proceed of crime you get it back. 
You do time for the coke but have the $100k waiting for you when you get out. The move Ulbricht has made is basically saying "bitcoin is not going to be worth much" so pre-trial is saying to the USMC to cash it out so it does not plummet in value. It is not about it being proceeds of crime at this point because he has given them permission, if he gets off he gets the cash waiting for him. 
Like i said before its basically Ulbricht saying BTC does not have a long term future. A bit like if he was arrested with VIP tickets to the next superbowl, they would let you cash them out before the event and hold the proceeds until after the trial.

You don't get offered in the traditional sense, its not that kind of world skippy.
You usually get approached by one of the gang of 4: Banks, The Government, The Illuminutty or the reptilians.
Now the banks pay the best but the rules suck and they think dress down fridays is a treat. The Government pays peanuts but the benifits are god and sometimes they let you play with new toys, we had great fun with the Brown Noise gun at last years Convention at Denver Airport! Those Chemtrail guys didn't know what hit them!
The Reptilians are all right but you have to get used to the tempratures of the offices and also that your working for the Royal Family so if you don't like Monarchs its not a good idea. Personally I went with the Illiminutty, you get to train at Atlantis and outwitting Hagbard Celine is always fun.

@_date: 2014-12-12 09:54:41










Yes it does. It is basic supply and demand economics. For the price to go up demand needs to outstrip supply, barring manipulation\ fluctuating on news, same goes for going down.
As more companies adopt Bitcoin they insta turn it into currency to pay suppliers, staff, taxes etc creating more coins entering the market then if it is just HODLERS and miners. Unless every single person rebuys the BTC they spend the effect of adoption will be to push the price down due to a glut of coins.

How was he able to see your order number, was it displayed publically or was the guy that posted the one with the hot card that did the order for you?


I wonder why someone would post a tutorial given how purse is so heavily policed and totally stops fraud right &gt; contacted the woman which credit card was used and asked her to press charges so they can get that high profile CC scammer.
She would have pressed chargesanyway as part of the reimbursement if she claimed the transaction wasn't hers. You basically sign a document stating it was not you and authorise the bank\cc to pursue it in the court so you would still be at the exact same place.


So you were warned in september that you were under investigation? Even after everything that has happened you then say things like:


BTW you left your Birthdate unblacked out. Stop defending purse and don't let them pay your fee's you are only making further connections between them and you. You are looking at some serious criminal charges because of those dipshits why would you want anything further to do with them?

On the software/backend side no bitcoin business would pass an audit that a bank would require. Hence how come they get getting "hacked" or having week long outages.
AML/KYC is a teeny tiny part of the amount of compliance you would need to be operating legitimately and not part of a start up "rules do not apply to us" company". Plus stuff costs money and people in hate fee's

Proof? I highly doubt they are regulated to the degree a bank/financial would need to be. If they are then HSBC would not cut ties.
If someone is not compliant and you don't cut ties then you can fail your compliance as well.
Remember this is HSBC, whose Mexican branch took money from the Cartels. If they were even close to being fully compliant i doubt they would cut them off.
Compliance is not just AML/KYC it covers everything from reporting transfers over a certain amount, protecting customers data, physical and data security, HR, Service contracts on owned equipment, set SLA's etc etc
The SLA's in particular is a good one. If your on the BACS network and something goes pop you are racking up fines in the millions after a few hours. Xapo went down for over a week with a "we are moving, it will be fine next week"

Most national laws make some distinction between handling stolen goods and knowingly handling stolen goods. If you are sold some thing as legit and it turns out stolen most of the time the police will take it to return to original owner and give you a warning if you co-operate i.e Who did you buy it from.
If you knowingly handle stolen goods then there are harsher penalty's.
Say I saw 2 Ferrari F40's being advertised for really low prices, one is $10,000 and the other $9000. I go to the 10k one first, the guy has the keys, owners manual service history etc but is selliing it because his wife died in it and he thinks its haunted. The next one is 10% cheaper but has a smashed in drivers side door and needs to be started using a screwdriver. The guy says someone vandalsed it and the screwdriver is a known issue and replacement Ferrari parts are expensive. Oh and the papers for it were stolen when they did the window in.
If you buy the 10k one and it turns out stolen then likely they will confiscate it and tell you "tough shit". If you buy the 9K one you are obviously buying\handling stolen goods and they will slam you for it.

BTW [THIS]( is what it looks like when a UK bank loses service for 3 hours let alone a whole week.
"Fail fast" is a fine motto within the small start ups that birthed it but it is not a mantra for every single business. Know why financials have these penalty clauses? Because it makes them pay attention to resilience, change control and not act like total cowboys.
Fun story: A major UK bank (well 3 but they were intermingled) went down a couple of years ago for a looooong time. Not only was this a massive shit storm but some customers were trapped in foreign countries in hospitals that they suddenly could not pay. All sorts of plan b's had to be invoked to get people home, keep people in treatment, stop people getting smacked with late mortgage and credit card fee's  etc.

NK can't do anything with Bitcoin either. What is a Bitcoin worth? either a cash value which they can't exchange it for or for goods and services which they also can't exchange it for.
I never said that it is OK regarding blocking payments in general. I said they are following international agreed sanctions. The wikileaks block was a private block done by the companies.
Your point about China is invalid Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Diners Club, JCB, Federal and Million all operate ATM's in China. There is not one payment processor for all of China. The banking system though is more controlled.


Otherwise known as "Asshole dictator regime" that gets itself sanctioned by the U.N or countries separately in the hope they will change their ways. The sanctions on Russia are hitting the Ruble hard.

Of course they did not even bother to use cabs and stacked them on wooden garage shelves at a power/BTU density that would again get you marched off the premises.
Given the long shot i also don't see any form of PDU but i guess that could be on the other side if I am being fair. Chances are they were running a pile of power cables next to each other like the Chinese one featured a while back.
Also WOW fans! We don't need no stinking aircon in Thailand (well known for its ice cold climate) , or any form of fire suppression, in a wood barn. Not to mention how the air is unfiltered etc etc.
I could write a book on what is wrong with this setup but i guess someone will still chime in with the same excuse Xapo got of "at least they tried!"

Getting it back though is the trouble. I was watching a documentary about fusion and Hydrogen-3. It is only made on Earth as by product of nuclear reactors but could be used for easier fusion (it also has medical uses).
The moon has loads of Hydrogen-3 but it would be too expensive to bring back. The analogy used was "If there were gold bricks in piles on the moon ready to be loaded it still would not be profitable to bring them back"

My English to nutjob translator is broke so i don't really understand this sentence. P2P finance is regulated in some countries (like the UK) it just doesn't have any protection with it.
You act illegally, you get caught. Its all in the game. If most localbitcoin sellers did an hours worth of research they could find out how to continue and pay less tax and be patted on the pat by the taxman\ government for running a successful business.
It's a bit like a can drive down the road at 50mph being the speed limit and get no shit from the police. If i do it at 90 mph sideways they tend to take a dim view. Bitcoin businesses are run by cowboys who think most rules do not apply to them because they are special or its too hard.
Well tough shit. I had to shelve several business plans because it was not worth the legal risk or could not afford to bring it up to spec. You can't just go "nah fuck it launch anyway" and not expect to get slammed.

In the land of the free you can only gamble in certain "safe" zones. Else it is done through organized crime. By comparison in the UK most High street's have a bookies and several of the bigger sites are listed on the LSE.
Gambling is an American problem and one you can get sent to jail for even if you are not an American, Do not have Servers in America but if you let someone from America play on your site without adequate checks then you can be extradited to face charges.

People need to understand that banks are heavily regulated on what they can and can't do and also that there are different and often overlapping regulations depending on which sector (retail, investment) or even division(IT,HR etc) within the company. 
Now before some smart ass jumps in with yeah but here is a headline about bank X doing thing Y, that is an exception not the rule and is often down to a single entity going rogue (trader,support or even a national division like HSBC Mexico). Once caught they then get bitchslapped with fines, again you can argue (justifiably) these are not enough but that is how the financial industry works.
You can't just fire up a financial company and ignore all these points and expect to be treated as an equal. This is not banks "trying to destroy Bitcoin" it is banks fearing that their own compliance is at risk.
Bitcoin exchanges are high risk, mostly illegal and the ones that have jumped through some legal hoops likely have not done all of them and bring in peanuts compared to the risk they carry.

Start by speaking to your freind who obviously does not understand the meaning of "explanation" and "terms and conditions" Specifically:
"We may end this agreement immediately (and 
stop providing services and close your account) 
if we reasonably believe you have seriously or 
persistently broken any terms of the agreement or 
we have reasonable grounds for thinking that you 
have done any of the following things, which you 
must not do:
• you put us in a position where we **might** break 
a law, regulation, code or other duty that applies 
to us if we maintain your account
Other circumstances in which we can end the agreement
We can also end this agreement immediately 
(and stop providing services and close your 
account) if we **reasonably believe that maintaining 
your account might expose us (or another 
Barclays company) to action or censure from any 
government, regulator or law enforcement agency**
(emphasis mine)
Making 5 or 6 cash trades on localbitcoins per day will trip a number of alarms. He did not disclose the size of the transactions either. So assuming he was profiting on the sales we have likely tax evasion, they can close your account then and there for that.
Not to mention large sums of cash going in and out of **A PERSONAL ACCOUNT** is a major sign of money muling and illegal activity.

You know an I.P is worthless without a court order right? Very few people have static I.P's so you would need the ISP to confirm that user had that I.P at that time period.
So unless he was logging in to other sites using his own credentials on your PC then you do not have much. If he was dumb enough to log in elsewhere using his own credentials on your PC you might get some help from forum admins etc.
One of the biggest myth's the likes of CSI like to perpetuate is that I.P's mean something. They really donn't unless you get a court order to prove which customer had which I.P. On a standard home setup your I.P will change at least once every 24 hours.

Watching Xapo is like watching a clown dance through a minefield. Lets take a looky look at what their Chief Strategist has come up with:


Stop comparing yourselves to credit cards Xapo. You do not offer the same functionality. It is like comparing a car to an aircraft because they both have wheels.


Like Paypal,Skrill etc? Those are also native to the net and can manage compliance AND not have week long outages!


Very debateable due to not including costs of upgrading PoS systems, staff costs etc.




Ah there we go! Comparing Bitcoin to the internet at 199x, the standard ploy. The internet is infrastructure bitcoin is a service. It is more akin to the internet being roads and bitcoin the car.
Comparing Bitcoin to the internet at any point is a false analogy and anyone who actually knows about either should see that.


Seriously? Calling Bitcoin convenient is just delusional. 10 minute confirm time? non-scalable transactions per minute? Yes you can get around these problems but this article is cherry picking bits of Bitcoin then showing other bits of how the financial system works around problems.




WTF kind of drugs is this guy on and where can i get some. Bitcoin runs OVER the internet. The internet goes down so does bitcoin. Do a bitcoin transaction to North Korea via the internet and see. Beyond a few other things like some of the radio stuff that is more a proof of concept bitcoin needs the internet.


Any online business is born global. This is like saying your special because you breath air. Mind you at Xapo they probably give out prizes every week for that.


Seriously now, what drugs is he on and where can i get some? You want to talk about human evolution and ignore the fact that coins have been in use for millennia, then paper notes and other financial instruments? Really?


No doubt. Where can i see what code Xapo is running on?


Xapo the financial service that has brushes of  outages that a normal financial would scream at wants to talk about standardisation? Show me one compliance rating Xapo has? PCI-DSS? ISO? any form of industry standard?
TL;DR The Chief strategist of Xapo is either on some serious drugs or does not have a clue about the world we all live in and the financial world they operate in. Either that or he is fully aware and puts out puff pieces full of misinformation knowingly.
Keep going Xapo. Since BFL fell you have become the front runner in hilariously incompetent bitcoin companies that will be smacked with the ban hammer (or get "hacked")sometime soon.

I said about USB keys not collusion. you know the life expectancy of a USB key to JESD218A specs is about two years right? It doesn't matter what security procedures you have in place when the media you are using is probably the most unreliable format for long term storage. You could have them watched by Navy SEAL's 24/7 and in a nuke proof bunker it won't change the fact that USB keys are not designed for long term storage.
Banks still use tape drives for offline\offsite backups even with redundant SAN arrays. Nobody uses USB keys for long term storage because they are the cheapest form of flash memory which is itself not suited for long term storage.
USB keys are designed for taking data from point A to point B. They should not be used for long term storage for many reasons (cheap chips, degradation etc). If you need them stored to be access use a secure DC with SAN's, ideally at multiple DC's. If you want offline storage use tapes.
It's Data Storage 101 and something that would likely come under the masses of audits that financials face. Even laptops and desktops in large financials have to have USB disabled for security purposes (depends where you are, i know at least 1 UK bank does this).

Yeah they probably did. They said the price of BTC is falling through the floor so if you want to have anything left IF you win cash out now. USMC agreed because IF he loses its a bigger amount for them.
Win-Win for both sides. What good is having some brainwallet somewhere when he can come out in 5 years and have BTC worth nothing? This way if he doesn't get put away and assests seized he is guarenteed $X, this also applies if he gets off on mistrial,appeal, technicality etc.

The thing is neither are currently up to spec compared to what a financial would be like regarding data security and backup. Coinbase do seem to be moving ahead a bit better now with adressing some of my concerns in another thread.
Financial IT infrastructure is very hard and costly to do right. The only reason the banks do it is because they are forced to. The recent issues Blcokchain.info highlight what happens when proper standards and procedures are not followed.
At some point people will have to be prepared to pay for the security they require. Banks offset this with the money they bring in from retail (loans, mortgages etc) and investment sides of the business. Not many places outside of America charge for a bank account.
Else your just going to get the usual shoulder shrugging and "we was hacked" if you store your Bitcoins elsewhere. If there is no regulation to force them to do it, then the like of Coinbase &amp; Circle will need to be able to charge as they can't eat the cost like a bank does.

you bring up supporting a larger economy on something that can maintain 7 transactions per second. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, it's value is as a currency.
Other things such as gold are useful for electronics, heat shielding, propping open a door, whatever. Most of golds value comes from it being a value store but if it wasn't we would still use it in things.
Bitcoins value comes from darknet markets, speculators, ransomware, scams and the odd honest business. The latter of which get pitchforked into oblivion when they don't act in a prescribed way.
Bitcoins do have a value, today it is $240ish 6 months time who knows. With no intrinsic value it could easily fall to penny's.

Oh dear, they seem to have gone off on one again without doing the research. There is a reason why things that already do this (folding et all) run as batch jobs and nto real time. A big challenge of distributed processing is to avoid things like race conditions and dependency of one part needing another to finish first.
Now it is one thing to do that when you are dealing with lag between various different processors inside a single supercomputer but if you are dealing with the public internet that is a whole different ball game. 
It will also be more expensive then EC2 and its competitors both in terms of compute cost but also in programming time. If it were a feasible option you could do it now without bitcoin and utilize x86\x64 architecture without needing to build out your own chips etc. All you would need is to log time and pay over a certain amount rather then in penny shavings. No one is doing this (except botnets), I wonder why?

No it isn't thats just a small part of the customer facing side. Let me give a few examples that would fail an audit:
* Is there equipment supported i.e vendor supported (no windows xp, EoL hardware etc) and support contracts in place?
* What are the access policies at there offices and datacenters?
* What change approval process do they have in place? If its anything like Xapo's its a clownshow
* Are they able to pass an ISO audit which is a huge deal and includes everything including how documents are stored etc
* PCI DSS for anything that touches a card
And on and on it goes. Banks do not have massive compliance departments for nothing. If someone you are doing business with fails an audit, you can be liable. This is why banks cut anyone off the second they get a hint anything is up with the business processes.
EDIT: If XAPO were running out of the UK their week long outage "because we are moving shit around" would have them fined into the millions of pounds figure. Especially if they were hooked into faster payments. Also being a card want to bet they won't pass a PCI audit?

If you read back through not once did i level anything personal at you, only at the crass efforts of Changetip to piggy back on a disaster killing thousands to get signups. For that I am being accused of "discourage people from donating to charitable causes" so you know what?
[I have made a no strings donation of more than Changetip, a company with $4 million in VC funding. This was done using filthy fiat and also qualifies for an extra 25% from the UK government]( No doubt there will be some reason why this is wrong but at least it's not dependent on people signing up to some company that thinks it is a good idea to use the death of thousands to promote themselves.
Please feel free to one up me on it, the more the merrier. Also bear in mind my comments about Changetip are towards the company and not you and despite this you as both a mod and a Changetip representative have made personal insults against me.
Stay classy Changetip

Because you don't make a profit (or revenue) on email. Are people really that dense in this sub?
If you mine a bitcoin and sell it depending on your region you either make a capital gain (where it is treated as a commodity) or an income\profit (where it is a currency).
If you make more then a certain amount, you pay taxes. If you don't declare any amount and you do it then you get stomped by the tax man. It is the equivalent of working "cash in hand". 
A piece of software is not a physical object either. If i was hired to be on Theymos' super dev team at $100,000 a year but did not report that at tax time then i can expect a visit from the tax man.
Death and Taxes are the only two things you can guarantee in life. If your making money doing something and not declaring it as taxable income, chances are you should be. 
Of course this is only relevant to individuals. If you set up a company you can have a fun time dodging tax legally but paying a small (sub $100) fee to set up a Limited Company (or LLC or the German version) and getting a business bank account seems to be too hard for 99% of the people here.

You either authorise with the autonoums AP, A combined AP/Router (home setups) or a lightweight AP and WLC (enterprise). Computers only factor into it when you are using things like proxy servers.
[This] ( )Will show you the basic settings of WebAuth on Cisco gear. For home solutions you are authing based on the PSK of the router (most of the time) unless you are building access software onto the router (like BT OpenNet does).

Did you apply through the DHS site for it? IIRC you have to go through a DHS website, punch in your name, passport etc and so long as your not on the no fly list and pay the $13 or whatever it is you are done. Then your under the visa waver, you still have to fill out the paper form thingy on arrival but you don't need to get special permission to enter the country like on a normal visa.

Government insures them in a robbery? Sure they do, those insurance contracts they pay out fortunes for is just for fun.


They either own the machines outright or are run by a third party on the banks behalf. Also most banks around here don't charge fee's. 3rd party ATM operators do for upkeep of the ATM. So your 2\2 for flat out lies.


Yeah, Zero using a UK-UK account!


Hence savings account. Also the UK inflation rate hovered around 0 for 2015, an ISA (tax free) savings account paid 2-3% at the time.


Because for a third time they make money on mortgages, loans etc.

Official Motto of @_date: 2015-05-17 20:57:00


For every person that signs up we will give a whole dollar (maximum $100) 
Using the deaths of thousands as an excuse to promote their service. Notice how other companies don't go "If you sign up for a GenericBank Visa today we will give you $1 to donate!" Because its a crass and disgusting marketing technique.


Same reason they pay facebook, google, nike (who make a fortune off the data their trackers gather) etc, for advertising mostly.
Point is Changetip at present does not have a sustainable business model and uses a mass tragedy for advertising. Even when advertising it offers a pitiful amount to the point [I donated more then them (with no strings attached as well) whilst exchanging words with BashCo on their testing in that was going on at the same time (during the conversation it came out that was to a user request and not random testing). They have also had multiple accounts banned for various things as well.
EDIT: Also you don't use charity money to get money in to a country you use it from where ever you are based at to pay for fuel, rations, aircraft etc and then fly that into the disaster zone. Funnily enougth if a natural disaster occurs that is big enough to require international aid it usually knocks out power and internet rendering changetip useless to get donations into the country.

Any bets are irrelevant, I'm looking at facts of the BFL case.
1) They "shipped" your miner 3 ft, with your full support (by taking up the free hosting)
2) BFL had no way to meet deadlines, this was widely suspected in the community at the time, BFL did it before with FPGA's and internal logs from the investigation showed this.
So by your own admission you took part in the BFL fraud either knowingly or unknowingly, the latter i find hard given they couldn't get FPGA gear out on time.
Further the author of CGminer claims you took portions of his code without giving proper credit per license. Don't know how this would be class in ye olde worlde terms, theft?

80% is on the low end. Aside from DNM's most bitcoin based businesses (exchanges etc) are not being run to local regulations, are not following industry standard procedures etc. Then you have Purse acting as a CC theft front and Gyft exploiting a referral scheme (which not technically illegal). Even mining gear manufactures are just painting on FCC approval and stuff as there is no way most would pass standards testing.
There are very few legal businesses involved in bitcoin and the ones that were have been chased out like wholleyhemps business. Just because you can exchange BTC for gift cards (even legal ones) means nothing. I have a load of potatoes in my garden i could sell, buy an Amazon giftcard and say Amazon accepts potatoes etc.

woah hit a nerve there didn't i? maybe you should try for rebel of the month clunbu nning against Davaii or whatever he was called.
The regulations were put inplace when bitcoin was dream in satoishi's eye not as a response. Just as an education let me break them down for you : 


This is to stop any mogoloid walking in from the streets claiming to be from IBM. I once worked a DC every day for tver a week and they all knew personally ( i bring foodz!). One day my change was late they would not let me in the car park and only bent the rules when i insisted i was cold and wet and getting further rained on (was on a motorbike). Even then they kept me in hte secure reception and not normal reception.


This is classed as an intrusive change just to open the cab door, Change Advisory Boards (CABS) hate intrusive changes


One time it was obviously a futzed part, they had a spare i asked to use the spare to restore resiliency , nope they wanted new even though it would take 4 hours to arrive with a field engineer in tow ( i outrank field engineers like a major out ranks an corporal).


Approxamately half of your change window is back out time, even if to back it out means its still fucked.


This is very serious no phones other then wired on the DC floor and they have 1m long extension cables. Need a patch or a new version of vmware? your screwed.


Most predate modern computers goiing back to the 70's and Jackbooted thugs does not describe the nice men and women of DC security who often poke you on the shoulder first and tell you to knock it off.
You are right though i have worked for banks, i have worked for retial operations, i also for a glorious month worked for an F1 team sch is the life of a ~~scumbag~~ contractor. All have very similar access controls.
Do you know what happens if a bank pulls a Bitstamp? they start racking up millions of fines for not meeting SLA's. Given all the hassle above i have had when the CIO and VP's have been involved not of some piss ant start up but of multiple fortune 500 companies

Compliance costs remain the same or higher with bitcoin in countries with legalized gambling.


Or they could take a small commission like current p2p betting services do.


Breaking even on average is usually not a reason why people gamble. There is a very easy way to break even on betting, don't bet. With poker\blackjack etc  use play money.


Ah so the 1% fallacy is not good enough now so its the 5% fallacy?

Yes you are, you just have to meet existing financial regulations put in place by the host nation and away you go. Several new banks formed as internet only in the UK in the early 00's with no retail locations but all are compliant with financial regulations. There will be a new bank forming soon out of a chunk of RBS.
So you can start a new bank anytime you want, saying you can't do that because it is expensive is like bitching you can't start a Formula 1 team overnight.

Yeah but generally if the thing is shut off before the water is dropped on it then the damage is minimal. Plus if anyone is on the floor at the time worst case is they get a bit wet.
The whole system is automated so anything in the same cab is switched over to its partner and closed down as fast as possible. Then power is cut to the cab/surrounding cabs then water dumped (if needed). Needs less storage of gasses/less check ups and i am not even sure if the alternatives are allowed in the EU.
Unlike every bitcoin business ever all the banks kit is N+1 redundant anyway so losing a cab or two is no big deal in the short term. Then they get the vendor on the phone and get new kit shipped in (can be on a 4-hour contract) to bring back redundancy. You know basic compliance and stuff, again strange concept around here.
You also don't need to worry about legging it for a re-breather like in the old HALON days. Much the pity :)
@_date: 2016-01-08 20:03:27


Plenty of risk just having a normal account. Is your business a legitimate one? Are your customers businessess legitimate? etc. Very easy to trace things using normal money but your involved with Bitcoin so who knows. They could think you write software for DNM's and that if you don't go belly up they might get hit with extra paperwork caused by queries about payments you make and receive.
You could receive payments that turn out fradulant through no fault of your own but it tips the risk scales. So think about it why bother doing business with people involved in an area rife with scams, fraud and assorted illegal activity for little reward. 
I'm not saying you are doing any of those things but just by using bitcoin you are tainted by its reputation. This sub is a prime example of why people are not wanting to get involved with bitcoin when rampant conspiracy theories and "bitcoin will end all wars" drivel gets upvoted and fraudsters are hero's until they are caught (neo and bee anyone)

Oh the Irony, where to start? At no point did i say anything personal about you yet your start throwing accusations of "keyboard warrior" at me. Also calling people a paid shill\troll is a bannable offence IIRC on this sub but i'm not going to do that because contry to what you might think i pointed out the exact reason a FPS sponser would tell a bank to reign it in on risky accounts.
Go have a look over at the regulations and fines for Faster Payments then you see the logic behind Barclays. It has nothing to do with competition and everything to do with Barclays not getting themselves cut off as well.
Also people like yourself are the reason banks have problems with bitcoin. You were selling them through a personal account and doing thousands of trades. That is not what a personal account is specced for. I also doubt you have any form of company or accounting set up but that is neither here nor there.
Now times that by how ever many LBC sellers getting false hack\fraud claims and whatever and it makes dealing with bitcoin seem extremely risky and not worth it for the tiny percentage of the population that actually use it.

This has existed for over a decade. Look up Betfair a UK based betting exchange that is listed on the LSE. You place "Lay" bets where you act like the book keeper and can set the odds, this is then matched to people placing traditional "Back" bets.

Nope but I think it would be a very dangerous thing to have on your machine in countries that do not have US style laws. It could be used as a form of SWATing.
For example say some racist half wit doesn't like his muslim neighbors, a quick call to the police that he has seen them [throwing away chemicals]( mentioning something about using the internet to talk to his cousin in pakistan and that you think they are planning something [because they have been studying CCTV camera placement in the town center]( then watch the police swoop in. 
They will take any PC's as SOP then ask Mr GuiltyOfBeingBrown to decrypt everything. He can't and as it is a terror investigation that activates RIPA part 3 and cranks it up to a potential 5 years.
Basically like SWATing but for anyone using crypto they can't decrypt. Agree it is an unlikely scenario but it is something that is a possibility.

That is absolute rubbish. You can over power wi-fi pretty easily as it is low powered by design because it uses the ISM band. Set something up on 2.4ghz at a higher dBm broadcasting whitenoise and you shut down. You can also use the deauth attack like Marriot did at lower power with just as much success. You can do the same to 5 GHz or just make the signal look like RADAR and let DFS do it for you.

It's not my theory as mentioned but GOX maintained a margin over other exchanges (i used to arbitrage gox and btc-e) so they use Gox to get the BTC as dollars are harder to move, shuffle these into China where again they were selling for more then get the money back out of China.
The Chinese exchanges tended to run higher then non-Chinese due to the hassle of getting hard currency out of them to a consumer bank account holder. So imagine if you could source unlimited BTC through gox and could make +5-10% selling in China. Free money right?


This is Mark the Karp who makes changes in production, shared a personal account with gox's deposit etc etc. He was in his own lalala land.
Having done a lot of arbitrage in 2012/13 if you could get money in and out of China you would have been laughing all the way to the bank. The theory above works for me because it uses willy to get BTC (by offering more then other exchanges), shuffle to China and repay the original debt.

Let me translate: 
The account owner has a personal account. the bank started seeing money transfers\ cash transfers coming in from all over which is a red flag for money laundering.
They tip off the police who went to investigate and seized the money pending investigation.
The guy not revealing the source makes it sound more like he was a drug dealer.
He eventually lawyers up (he would have been provided one but hey ho) and tells them it cam from bitcoin trading.
The police give the money back.
**How can i avoid this happening to me?**
1.  Don't use a personal bank account for business transactions, it really pisses the banks off as the risk and expectations of usage are different
2. If you do trade bitcoins declare it on your capital gains. His amount was under what he would have had to pay anyway.
3. If the police stop you then say "it is from my bitcoin trading, here is my tax return"
4. Get a nice apology and walk away
For the love of all things holy stop using your god damn personal accounts on LBC. You may as well run around the bank in a neon green zentai screaming "I'm money muling\laundering\dealing."

Yes there is, read the small print. You are using a personal bank account for business purposes (trading bitcoin). You do not even have a company set up and you wonder why you are refused a bank account for the purposes of money exchange?
Also don't file as a sole trader, file as a LTD there is so much more protection and fun and games you can play with the tax man. Plus if it goes belly up they can only get company assets and not personal ones (sole trader they can come after everything you own).


They are operating exchanges on a much bigger scale. If you comply to the various UK and european financial regulations you will be fine. Here is a big hint AML\KYC is a tiny part of it. From the IT side alone you need support in place, if you touch payment cards you need to be PCI DSS complaint, ISO 27001 helps, you need to fully meet data protection laws etc.
The barrier to entry is high but so is setting up your own airline or opening your own hospital. Most bitcoin exchanges think compliance begins and ends at AML and that is why banks cut them off because come audit time you are only as strong as the weakest link.
You should be approaching it from the angle of a currency store and not an exchange\bank though where the barrier to entry is much lower. Please read the paper work though, no wonder you got turned down if you have no source of income and haven't even paid £29 to register a company with companies house.

Before you bibble on next time maybe you should read up about who frequencies are licensed out and that even though the ISM band is unlicensed you still have to meet regulations on power etc.
Then look at the various other laws that bleed other into the space (i.e DoS) and put the too together to see what Marriot did was really stupid because it gets the regulatory body to come down on them like a sack of bricks.


You realize that most big enterprise IT companies offer regulatory checks right? And that the regulations themselves are drawn up by international bodies some of which are non governmental?


There is no monopoly. Countries are free to choose what they do in ISM band within reason. This is why EU, Asia and the U.S have a different set of wi-fi channels.

You know why he did that? Because the Japanese judicial system is heavily weighted on showing remorse. If he had not done this his sentance would be bigger and more likely to be found guilty. This is why Japanese politicians\businessmen cry like babies when caught because to do anything else gets you more time.
It is even worse for juvenile offenders. You can be held for a year in a reform school and your behavior monitored BEFORE you get sentenced. Act all repentant and a good boy and you might get a light sentance and walk free, tell the teacher to go fuck themselves and you do your prison time on top of reform school (reform school = prison for juvies anyway).

Courtesy of opper's book (in the excerpts that have been published elsewhere) seems to say that the April/2013 boom was due to big whales like Andreessen and the Fortress Group investing lots of money in bitcoin, after attending a bitcoin presentation by Wences Casares in March 2013.
My own favorite theory is that the bubble started in Jan/2013 when BTC-China and Bitfinex made bitcoin popular in Shanghai and Hong Kong. My guess is that Mark or some other MtGOX insider decided to profit from the bubble by trading in China with the customers' bitcoins. So the guy created Willy, who would buy bitcoins from other customers at a 10% premium with non-existent dollars, withdraw them and sell them in China. The plan must have been to bring the revenue from those sales out of China, and use part of it to fill the clients' dollar accounts, pocketing the profit.
That scheme apparently continued all through the Nov/2013 peak. But the plan would have collapsed in Dec/2013 when the PBoC blocked the accounts of the Chinese exchanges. Otherwise, the purchases of bitcoins by the Chinese during 2013 would have meant at least half a billion dollars in CNY leaving the country, in exchange for a bunch of "worthless nothings" that had been imported without licenses or taxes...
TL;DR this is what he was trying until chinese money ran out.

That was nothing to do with chip access. The features are part of the protocol and it was a deauth attack and is something pretty much any enterprise level wireless system can do but most people don't because it is a legal minefield.
Basically all it does is broadcast to the other network "i'm done" when you are not. The AP then cuts you off, your client tries to reconnect to your AP and there AP sends another deauth etc.
You know what stops this being more widespread? Regulation! Just like what stops someone from having something broadcasting on extreme power on the ISM band and cutting off everyones wi-fi etc.

No, its more a case of "if you want to play in the big leagues here is the rule book you have to follow". Most bitcoin companies haven't got a clue as to what regulations they need to follow.
If you can meet all the requirements then the banks will work with you. You can get a faster payments hook (free) if you qualify to deposit with the Bank of England direct, else you need a sponsor. No one is going to sponsor a company that has not been compliance checked to the industry standards etc.

It is paid out of [national insurance]( which both employer and employee pay. For the employee it works out as between 5.8-12% for most people depending on how much you earn.
A prescription then costs 8 GBP ish regardless of drug cost. You can also buy a prepay card so for £120ish annually that is all your prescriptions covered.
The U.S co-pay kicks in at the start so you fall down some stairs and end up in hospital for a long time you are looking at copay+paying your health insurance. You do it in the UK you don't have to worry about paying for your treatment then and there.
There is also no such thing as uninsured. If you are unemployed, disabled a student, low income etc you don't pay NI and you don't have to pay prescription costs.
Again the UK spends less per head on healthcare then the U.S. NI contributions are also much less then the figures you see people paying for insurance and scale with wages (so low earners don't pay much).
NI also gives you a state pension, unemployment\disability (without a time cap) and maternity allowence if not provided by your job. So it is a bit more then just health insurance.
EDIT: You can also double dip if you have private health insurance. Mine costs £800 ish per year for two people and means you don't have to wait for treatment, get private rooms, have things done in separate private hospitals etc. This is similar to the U.S system but again no co pay and a hell of a lot cheaper, Private is not subsidized so for a private prescription you pay the market cost of a drug.

Again no need though as transfers in the UK are usually done in an hour or two and in the EU often same day. Most EU accounts also do not charge fee's for transfers nor do they charge a fee for having an account.

No it isn't and it is a responsibility of the bank under EU law to report this. If they have reasonable suspicion that a crime is occurring then the police investigate. The guy did not help matters by refusing to talk making him seem like a launderer\dealer. Once he got his paid lawyer the lawyer told the police where it was from and he got released with his coins. He could of told the provided lawyer this but didn't for whatever reason.
All this good have been avoided if he didn't use a personal account and explained when he was initially questioned. As the article states bitcoin trading is not a crime and his amount is below what is required for capital gains.

A stolen CC has a short life span. You have until the transactions are noticed (1-day - 6 weeksish) and anywhere you ship to is tied to you and can be traced to bust you.
So instead you set up an account with a fake address (maybe even the one on the stolen card depending on the data snatched) and buy some Amazon gift certificates. You now have gift certificates that won't age out.
So you go on purse to sell them immediately and put a huge discount on because you paid say $1 for the CC (if that) and want to cash out the $100 gift card you bought. Someone buys the giftcard for btc which now can't be taken away from you (mostly).
If they use the giftcard before the card fraud is reported it goes through amazon fine. If the card has been reported they invalidate the gift card and this is where people have had balances removed from there accounts.
Notice that the one surefire address\id in all of this is yours so unless you are on a fresh amazon account they have a good idea where to find you. usually it is small fry and not worth doing but if it became a thing you can bet they would start sending criminal complaints about the carded vouchers.

Even if you don't belive that then scroll back to the Iraq War being started for "WMD's" which were never found (apart from some old rotting ones that were left over from before Gulf War 1). No Iraq War = No ISIS.


That is not what people are saying, you are being an idiot. People are saying no one except the U.S wanted the second Iraq War ( it caused the biggest political rally in the UK against it, the UK went in because Blair did what ever the U.S president says).
Compare to the first Gulf War, which had a crystal clear mandate from the UN and most western nations involved.
Not to mention how the U.S dicking around in Afghanistan trained up Bin Laden, How the U.S and UK overthrew Iran's democratically elected leader kicking off a chain of events that led to Iran becoming the state it is. etc etc.

This sub has a major blind spot in comprehending laws. In purse's case it is that the duty should be on Amazon to catch them not Purse. Doesn't matter that Amazon do catch orders and purse have said to spend the cards immediately (which is totally not shady).

5% is legitimate as they use amazon referrals to make up the gap. The deeper the discount the more likely you are going to run into CC fraud. The german guy whose house was raided got raided because his name was in a tutorial on a carders site about how to use purse to commit CC fraud.
Of course purse care so they offer $10k in legal fee's which is not shady in the slightest. So if 30% is worth a potential police search then go for it! Also Amazon have been known to remove the money when it is found out to be stolen leaving you out of pocket. Purses answer: use the giftcard immediately.

No one has been able to get in touch with FreidCat but he moved some coins before going AWOL. Current thinking is :
* He has been arrested, his family and freinds have checked police stations and can't find him, then again China
* He has ran off with the coins and gear
* The gear was stolen and his disappearence is seperate.
There is a long ass thread on bitcointalk mostly people claiming they will use their "special Russian and Chinese special forces" contacts to go after him etc. Nothing has happened(it started in January) and he has not been found.

is about the DNM's not a market place in itself. Subs that directly sell get shutdown. Airbnb is in a grey area that they protect themselves from because they shift responsibility onto you. Most places have things against subletting etc. 
Purse sit directly inbetween carders and buyers whilst making money from the transaction. They are not legitimate in the slightest, they have had sockpuppets come on here and promote them with more vigor then paid spokespeople and several people like OP have found cards cancelled and one guy was raided.

I've made a reasonable amount from bitcoin in terms of early mining and arbitrage (back when Gox was around this was incredibly easy). I understand Bitcoin fine hence why i find posts like this tweet amusing.
Bitcoin is great for what it is but it is not a replacement for every single use of currency and finance in the whole known universe. If people stop trying to ram a square peg into a round hole and actually focused it might go somewhere beyond a small niche just like how people are interested in blockchain systems but not bitcoin.
To say Bitcoin will become the new reserve currency is ridiculously stupid when one unknown entity controls a significant chunk, it gets backed up from a stress test that wouldn't even register on a financial network and it depends on an infrastructure that is out of any control.
That last point whilst a selling point for Bitcoin is not one you want for a reserve currency. It is a fundamental opposite of what you need in a reserve currency.

The average person has no idea the costs involved and non-creators required. Authors are often asked why they don't move to self publishing to get a bigger chunk. The common answer is they don't want to because it means more work, by being under a publisher they just have to write it. They don't have to proof read, work out the legal contracts per region, market it etc etc.

Purse is a small fish in a big pond for CC fraud but they still enable CC fraud.
I have no problem knocking off these posts if purse and thier "fans" stop the astroturfing going on. 5 posts calling them wonderful in 36 hours ish and one user at least who is in every thread praising them like the second coming.
They often flat deny that ANY fraud happens, there are multiple cases above. Then they move to "it is Amazons job to stop it not us" except it isn't. If they care about stopping CC fraud they would put a hold on the vouchers to let them age beyond CC fraud reporting. They don't in fact they have told people to spend them immediately, again enabling CC fraud.

IIRC they do 150km/h but those ones are designed for speed so no payload and short battery so it is all a compromise. Anything that is lifting a payload will be slowed.
Also i think the max altitude is something like 800 meters by some guy in Russia (legal limit in the U.S is 500ft IIRC) so again not much height.
So unless you go to a different design quadcopters won't be doing much cargo work. Zipping across prison yards to drop and things though is a good (but illegal) use case.
What happens when an illegal one hits a legal one? If the legal ones are sensored up they would pick up the illegal one and would report it?

OOOO boy where to start here. Not sure where you got violently imposed from given it was done by a democratically elected government after votes for women were bought in.
 &gt; You cannot impose a reality that doesn't exist without causing disaster.
It existed prior to 1914 then when it was bought back it stopped the post war recovery and resulted in a run on the Pound causing the UK to come back off it again in 1931
That little inconvenience was WWI, you know the first world war. It was kind of a big deal that changed everything. The war reparations\rebuilding killed the gold standard. The various depressions amplfied the effect on Germany causing the hyperinflation which in turn led to the rise of extremists and ultimately WW2.
Funny how coming off the gold standard allowed the UK to drop interest rates and have the economy bounce back to almost pre depression levels before mass re-armament.

They had an open crime because the women whose card was copied reported it. Most banks auto report this to police for insurance purposes and so now it is officially a crime.
So you have an official crime and up pops Mr German Purse customer and stolen card number on a carding website. What would you do as German police?
It is an overreaction sure but they did not know at the time and might have thought the German purse customer was the one writing the tutorial.

Not to mention users have posted about orders being cancelled by Amazon who picked it up as fraudulent. not forgetting the one guy that actually got raided (and who knows if any more are in the pipeline).
Maybe Purse should get rid of their $10k legal fee offer. I mean as a legitimate business why would they need to cover any customers legal fee's right?
Also what you are meaning is not slander but libel. If purse thinks it has a case they can take us to court but i'm sure a judge will laugth his socks off once they see the business model resulting in a loss for purse. Not to mention there are probably a whole load of other smaller regulations they are breaking (i.e data protection etc)
EDIT: LOOK AT ALL THE LIBEL BELOW!!!!
[AGuy getting his house searched due to purse enabling Fraud](
[Someones $500 voucher not spent for a month is found to be fradulant by Amazon. Suprising huh](
[Purse locked someone out of thier account for "Suspecious activity" but there is no fraud in purse right? They let him back in anyway a few days later](
[This person had his $100 credit revoked by Amazon after 6 weeks. Guess that was when the card was reported](
[Another one having thier Amazon account frozen](
So much libel i will be in so much trouble in front of a judge for pointing out that PURSE FACILITATE CREDITCARD FRAUD!

That is what purse claim but it is baloney. The deeper discount ones are CC fraud and people have been caught. Not to mention Amazon have stopped multiple orders as well. Also does walmart offer to pay $10k in legal fee's if anything happens? Why do purse need to offer this if they know there model is not shady.
You can find specific examples including how a german guy was raided because his name was left ON A TUTORIAL OF HOW TO USE STOLEN CARDS THROUGH PURSE in other posts i have made on this thread.

[Read the thread]( he even posted his search warrant unredacted until people warned him. Plus the whole story and then in another thread how purse are paying his legal bills (updated a month ago). Then there was the guy 10 days ago whose $500 was taken off Amazon and purse refunded him.
The only person that has said anything nasty about me on reddit is you calling me a pedo because you don't like the fact i don't like scammers.
Do you not find it odd in the slightest that a crystal clean company has to offer to pay legal fee's? That orders have been stopped by both amazon, purse and police? That multiple threads a day appear praising them and the same people alternatively praise them and call everything else "FUD".
What kind of proof do you need? Something written in blood from Bezo's saying an order was paid for with a hot card?

Right sure I'm making this up. I mean if you walk into a target and buy something with cash it matches you face to a DB and tracks you that way right? You know when you use a credit card in a store it's only the data on the card they get? They have no clue what demographic you are (age, gender, income level etc) which makes the value of the data nose dive.


See above. It also means people are more likely to shop for the "discount" so creates a win-win situation. The customer benefits from reduced prices and they benefit from a much more detailed view of their consumers. That view is also incredibly expensive to get through other methods (focus groups, targeted advertising etc). The use of discount\loyalty cards allows them to see exact market changes and also historic trends, for example if they see a whole dmographic drop off buying (say the CEO makes a racist statement or something) they can see exactly what demographic is gone and not just a blank "sales are down 5%"


If i wanted to pose I would say i was a fighter pilot brain surgeon not a network engineer. I don't need to pose, margins are similar across the big vendors and if you want to double check try pushing the deal off the table on hardware costs. They barely budge but you try it near the end of a FY they will gouge software\services right down for you. Hardware they can't because the margin is not there. Some vendors even have some product lines going out at near cost because for enterprise they know you will have to buy a support contract for compliance and auditing purposes.
If you want to prove it for consumer PCs try pricing up the build cost of parts then compare. These days there is no much difference, given a big vendor has access to scales that a normal person doesn't it should be much wider if the margins were there.
If you doubt the value in analytics go in a Walmart or other big store with Wi-Fi. Why do you think that is there? Because they are nice? Or because they use it to monitor you through the store to build up a view of how traffic is flowing inside the building.

Nothing like a convicted felon shilling for a company that enables CC fraud. Why won't purse show their company registration details Roger? It is common practice for most businesses (and is a legal requirement in some countries). Why hide what should be public information? Oh right, the CC fraud:
[AGuy getting his house searched due to purse enabling Fraud](
[Someones $500 voucher not spent for a month is found to be fradulant by Amazon. Suprising huh](
[Purse locked someone out of thier account for "Suspecious activity" but there is no fraud in purse right? They let him back in anyway a few days later](
[This person had his $100 credit revoked by Amazon after 6 weeks. Guess that was when the card was reported](
[Another one having thier Amazon account frozen](
Purse themselves say:


[They also refuse to give out information that in most countries is required by law to be on their webpage such as a business adress and compnay registration number]( again nothing shady here.
All they give is "We are based in the Mission District in San Francisco. " Are they a LLP company? what is thier company number? why hide something that should be a public record anyway?

All of this is too warn people they may get there house raided due to involentry committing CC fraud, which has actually happened.

They are quick with the fines if you mess up. you got to remember a lot of financial crime is hard to pin on individuals so things like HSBC's mexican crimes just net them a fine.
Every internal communication within UK banks is recorded so when they can find individuals they will go after them like the ones getting busted over LIBOR fixing.
Point is there is a lot of regulation and compliance you need to operate as a financial provider in the EU. AML\KYC is just a tiny part of it. Most bitcoin businesses don't have a clue whatis required so no bank wants them because the risk that they bring is not worth the money the bank would make.
So ultimately it is the free market not letting them have bank accounts. If they could show they were not going to expose the banks to massive compliance headaches then a bank would love the extra £££. Most of the bitcoin companies seem to have no clue and people keep doing stupid stuff like trading on personal accounts and not even spending the £30ish and 10 minutes it takes to set up a ltd company.

In fairness it is a clusterfuck of a situation with multiple different factions against each other.

I think if you actually looked into it you would find plenty of information including from Joe Biden that the various Syrian factions with dodgy affiliations that eventually rolled into ISIS were funded through other countries in the area.
Why do you think Western Nations have been cagey about funding the Peshmagra who are effectively the Army\police of Kurdish Iraq and have been for decades? Why would they act cautiously around a legitimate force but give away stuff like candy to others that asked?
You can't rule out the possibility of some craziness going on (Iran-Contra happened after all) but the Syrian Rebels armed by the U.S were not the ones that turned to ISIS due to their links to al-queda and other "undesirable" factions.

Gratuitously stolen from :
exceedingly long tl;dr is a former mod, who ran a blind A/B test† randomly showing/hiding the "pay with bitcoin" option on his business' website, discovered that by including bitcoin as a payment option, he was actually losing money specifically because he was including bitcoin as a payment option.
He posted his findings in out of a desire to figure out what the issue was. Surprisingly, the bitcoin faithful were none too pleased to hear about this. For perhaps the first time, this didn't seem like it was good for bitcoin. As a result, they began to rather aggressively attack him, accusing him of being (surprise!) a paid shill, and then started in perhaps some of the most impotent rage of all time:
1. leaving negative reviews on his business' Yelp! page
1. harassing his customer support asking about why they weren't accepting bitcoin anymore
1. making fraudulent claims about how they had paid with bitcoin but never received orders
something interesting I remember about this: wholly later posted about while it's possible to prove that someone does own a bitcoin address, it is quite literally impossible to prove you do not own a bitcoin address.
  They link to a random transaction and say "that's me sending the money to you".
   I say I don't control that receiving address.
   I guess I could have generated all my receiving addresses in advance, put them all in my database, and hashed the table to "prove" it hasn't been tampered with, but hindsight is 20/20 and I'm guessing 99.99% of the general population doesn't even know what hashing is.
      It's their word against mine, and in the court of public opinion, businesses rarely are seen as victims.
    
1.  generally trying to destroy his business' hard-earned reputation
1.  to top it off, doxxing the poor guy
Interestingly, along with the alpaca socks guy, whollyhemp's business was a frequent target of mockery from (being hemp-based soap products). I didn't know it way-back-when he was an mod, but he actually sets aside a sizable amount of his profits for helping people in the developing world (through microloans, if I'm not mistaken).
He doesn't post here much, but he's become something of a fan-favorite (at least to me) for having emerged from the deepest depths of the other side. He ain't a but he's a pretty cool guy all around, and I feel like more than a bit of a jackass for having participated in making his business (pardon the pun) the butt of our jokes around here.
Oh yeah, on one more note, I really just won't buy anything from any website that offers a pay-with-bitcoin option, because I (and others) very seriously do believe that bitcoin is an actual, literal cult. I'm not sure if this explains 's findings, but I like to think it does.
†: a blind A/B test basically means that you show 50% of your visitors a web page  and 50% of your visitors a slightly-different web page  to try to discern if something in either page  or page  is making visitors not proceed with making a payment transaction. In this case, whollyhemp showed 50% of his visitors a pay-with-bitcoin option and 50% of his visitors no pay-with-bitcoin option. He discovered that he was leaving (I think it was) ~5-6% of his potential profits on the table simply by even having bitcoin as a payment option.
So the short tl;dr (that i didn't steal) is : He sold soap for bitcoin, did not get many orders, stopped taking bitcoin, went nuts at him, made him a honored mod and now he sells through Whole Foods

ETN's are like a promise from the bank to pay you whatever the asset is worth without you needing to be a commodities trader.
So say I think copper is going to go up, i buy into a copper ETN. The bank that underwrites it promises to pay me for the amount of copper when it matures - their fee's. I can buy and sell the ETN though.
Nowhere in the ETN does it say the bank has to secure the copper or anything else. They could if they wanted to or they could pay it all from cash never touching copper. If the bank goes belly up you loose the ETN. This means they are completely unsecured.
For a sub that hates global banking and debt its quiet funny seeing excitement over what is essentially a debt note from a bank\ wealth fund.

Banks provide services based on risk assessments and so personal accounts are often free\ low fee because they expect (and you agree to) a certain type of behavior i.e PERSONAL use. Business accounts charge for lots of small things that personal doesn't but includes more protection etc.

No they told an IoM based business that they couldn't link in to faster payments. This is because the Faster Payments network has massive compliance and SLA overheads. They were cut off for two reasons:
1) They likely did not have the compliance infrastructure in place
2) In Financial audits you are only as good as your weakest link. If they were not up to code any bank dealing with them would also fail the various audits.
Go look up how much financial compliance officers are paid. There is a reason it is so high and that reason is because it is a fucking minefield of SLA's, rules, regs, reporting etc.

Yes they are feeling threatened but not about Bitcoin. They don't want to fail an audit and working with Fidor means if Fidor fall down on anything so will they and then they get cut off from the banking network as well.
So the risk is massive and the reward tiny, not worth doing. Before anyone says AML\KYC that is a small part of dealing with a large financial. For example all equipment needs to be under vendor support contract, there are SLA's that if missed mean millions in fines (not like Xapo's week long outage) and often to get a hook into the network you have a hell of a lot of hoops to jump through such as:
* Being up to ISO/PCI Spec yourself
* Having a Clean room where only people that access the banks links have access and cannot be viewed from outside
* Strong Physical Security
* Regularly Pen/audit test
* Anti fraud measures etc
BACS and Faster Payments are two of the systems that clock up hefty fines for an outage as well as having very strict guidelines. Banks do business with Paypal they don't care if it is digital they care that the company they work with is all audited and secure else they get cut off as well.
Now imagine what would happen if RBS got cut off from BACS and faster payments due to a partner audit failure. Why would you risk it?

Pssst most planes fly on autopilot most of the time and the more modern ones rely heavily on different types of computers to keep them airborn.
Pilots usually to take offs and landings and even then things like auto throttle are used. Pilots don't often hand fly the whole trip unless something goes wrong.
This is not to rag on pilots they are highly trained and underpaid and can hand fly the plane if they want to it just makes more sense to have it fly itself most of the time. Landings are done by ILS and pilots are trained to land ILS by blinding them from the outside so they can only see there instruments.
You could have completely self flying and landing civilian planes if you wanted with a few more sensors and coding (i.e to pick up runway incursions etc) but the insurance would be massive and extra cost not worth the price of a pair of well trained pilots in the front.

I'm not familiar with Australia's laws but do know how financials operate. If you have done everything you are supposed to (i.e set up a proper company etc) and they refuse you an account it is likely because they see you as too high a risk.
Which bitcoin is whatever way you cut it due to its pseudo anonymity and not being able to trace as easy (i.e there is no easy way to prove an address belongs to a person and vice versa).

Boy you sure like using the word paradigm, any way back to civil wars. These occur when one group of citizens within a country disagree with another group and either try to change the current government or split into a new country\ join another one. That is when civil wars start, when a big enough group wants to break away they usually do not just upsticks and become New Buttlandia without the old nation they were a part of fighting them.
Of course micronations don't start civil wars because they achieve nothing apart from being masturbatory material for ancappers who see it as an easy route to being president of chucklenutistan. Apart from Drivelandia that was founded by a glorious el presidente.

Apart from a HDD dying unless you took adequate steps before hand. I lose my bank card, no problem. I lose my private key, ooops


But this raises an interesting question do you get your return in BTC or USD. Ideally it should come back as BTC but a lot of places seem to be doing it in dollars so how do you protect yourself as both a company and a consumer against price volatility


Never said they were


Nor do they need to but they can track bills when required through serials (the ole marked bill). Point is even paid cash that cash has a history going back through the businesses etc. However cash is dying out and direct account to account is even better to prove who paid what.


Which you assume is a problem for most people but it isn't. Look at the amount of people with store discount cards that do nothing but give away all your buying habits for a discount. Plus you have entered into a credit agreement and that in turn brings in a whole new load of consumer protection. Especially in the EU where they were even able to bitchslap Apple for there pathetic warranty policies


Indeed not but some are worse for example an exchange going belly up leaves you with nothing, a bank has deposits guaranteed etc. A pc mess up could wipe it out, a house fire could take out your PC and backup private key etc.
Bitcoin is great for it's small niche but is not ready for prime time. I mean imagine you get paid BTC, you try to convert as little as possible and spend direct and when it comes to pay your taxes the price nose dives. They can see you got say $3000/month worth of btc but now you only have $2500\month equivalent but have to meet the tax demand of the higher rate (of course in fairness it could go the other way and you make money).

If someone did do that IRL the bank would quickly but a cap on maximum withdrawals in a given time period (they probably already do). Now if i do it and hang around while the timer ticks down can they do something? Yes! They can tell you to GTFO.
If i block book all the flights on a plane am i DoSing it if i pay full price? The airline might bar you but it isn't a crime.

So it is not a lousy false positive, its a pretty good guess that most of the world are not running miners and those that are, are aware of them and can add them to the excluded list. Those running them and unaware are botnetted.

You know most people who wind up on end up there not because of bitcoin but because of bitcoiners.
Bitcoin is an interesting experiment and has enabled some new (mostly illegal) business models. It is when this sub goes full euphoria that people roll their eyes. For example:
* being burned at the stake for saying bitcoin hurt sales (ditto Mozilla). Made a mod of buttcoin for a laugth and was threatened with being doxxed.
* Constant throwing of penny shavings then getting pissy when someone doesn't want your 30 cents. 
* "We are all going to be millionaires HODL" which is the exact reason economists say deflation is bad
* Enabling Fraud\theft (purse,bawker,cigarette sellers) is fine because of the discounts
* Thinking most merchants care about chargebacks. They don't only charities(used to check if a stolen CC is still valid) and Porn have much of an issue. If you have issues with chargebacks chances are you are doing something wrong
* Thinking Bitcoin can replace a national currency or even all national currency's
* Screaming that Bitcoin is suitable for everyone despite requiring massive checklists for security and people still getting hacked
* The chance that any business involved in Bitcoin is either going to go broke or scam you is huge. Even ASICMINER have now run off with everyone's funds and that was probably one of the oldest entities in the commercial space.
* A complete misunderstanding of how the financial world works, followed by reinventing the wheel (don't use paper banknotes, use paper wallets)
It is Bitcoiners that turn people off of bitcoin not some grand conspiracy by the Bilderburg group with the RAND corporation and the reverse vampires.

Mike you seem to have no idea how the UK legal system works. This case would not even reach the CPS who would throw it out due to lack of evidence and tenuous link at best.
For example your point about it being peer to peer? It can be between two coinwallet employees then. You also don't seem to realize that intent is not everything especially regarding UK law.
I can intentionally be a dick and drive everywhere at 25 MPH, however there is no law against it regardless of the queues that might build up. I can openly state my intent is to back up traffic but it doesn't matter because THE LAW HAS NOT BEEN BROKEN.
Just like in this case. For it to come under UK law can you define the difference between bouncing coins around between wallets for your own use and what coinwallet are doing? Intent is mostly irrelevant until it gets to court.
Like i have said elsewhere if i setup a webserver on some ancient kit but have an I.P logger attached and it falls over you can't go after people for just visiting.
If they were malforming transactions or doing something to circumvent controls then you might have a case. It is completely irrelevant what the white paper says because for there to be a criminal case to answer in the UK some entity needs to have been harmed. The bitcoin network as a whole can not be used, OP could try for disruption to his business but again that would be very shakey ground and would likely have to go to a civil case.
You can't argue because they are not spending on goods and services one minute then get all excited when people use bitcoins blockchain for storing information on diamonds etc. Luke-Jr's storage of bible verses is enough to get it tossed out on that technicality.
I honestly don't know where you are from but I am guessing U.S? The British legal system is something completely different. Why do you think when one of the coinnews sites asked a solicitor they were told there "could" be a case under the relevant section. 
This is very hand wavy and makes it a useless statement because they have only glanced at it. Anyhow if you think a crime has been commited feel free to phone the UK police. Given it is a criminal offense it will require police action first to gather the information and then hand over to CPS who will decide if it is in the interests of the people to prosecute further. It won't cost someone in the UK anything except time so maybe one person spouting about how unfair it is in this sub should ring through to the police.
Of course they won't though because just like anything bitcoin a tiny number of people do something (like yourself) and everyone else sits on the sidelines alternating between hype and claiming oppression.
Any other financial would have adapted after the first "stress test" by not doing so under UK law you also risk the case getting thrown out. This is why Bank's have to display a very specifically worded warning at login on all IT kit in the UK. Even in clear cut cases if you have not taken reasnoble precautions the court will use that to reduce any judgement against the person that wronged you (for example a car hits someone on a motorcycle and they are wearing a helmet, shorts and nothing else, lack of protective gear factors into any relating case)

You won't if you are doing it through legal means. If everyone with a visa decided to start at a certain time of day on a specific day to donate $1 to Amnesty international and do it every minute for a week the following would happen:
1 Visa would not get so constipated easily
2 They would rapidly put in some change of ToC's to restrict transactions in a given space of time

See other companies adapt. large financials stress test themselves all the time and have plans in place should everything go down the tubes. It is part of the various regulatory and financial compliance checks they have to do.
The key takeawy though is instead of trying to argue if something is illegal or not (seriously go to a lawyer and get laugthed at) there needs to be changes made to prevent one small entity from affecting the network. Except no one can agree on anything around here.
This sub seriously thinks the big banks\ NSA\ lizard people are out for bitcoin but look a tiny company is backing it up with miniscule resources compared to the other entities.

Multiple teams in charge of various bits of the network, specialists from various hardware and software vendors, support contracts with tight SLA's (i.e 4 hour ones), oversight from national, and international organizations, independent compliance and risk mitigation processes that are audited at regular intervals and would be suicide for a bank to fail (ISO 27001, PCI DSS), Change control, Disaster recovery, N=1 redundancy, offsite backups and a whole load of things i have left out. Show me one bitcoin company that has even half of that.


Pretty irrelevant when 1 BTC is dividable down to how many decimal points?


Good luck intercepting that data in transmission. If you can do that there are some high paying jobs for you. Most bank\ cc theft comes from users being phished and the occasional dodgy cc processor serving dubious clients (online pharmacies etc) which is actually a good use case for BTC


Merchants know sod all about you. That is why they bought out discount cards so you voluntarily tell them everything you buy from them and where in exchange for a few % off. Online is a bit different but Amazon on BTC would be just the same as it is now.


The Faster Payments network clears bank to bank transfers same day (and has huge SLA penelty's if you mess up) Sepa is 2- 3 days. Your ten minute time is for one confirmation providing no stress test is going on and you paid the right fee. Assuming you wait for 6 and never convert to anything else then bitcoin is faster.


Varies between your bank but i can send money around the EU for free. My belgian account i think is free worldwide and my UK account is $20 for any amount to outside the EU (i think). Paypal is less though.


Other then the bit about time bitcoin does not beat fiat in anyway. On the time thing it only works providing you are not converting to another currency if you are going USD -&gt; btc-&gt; ZA Rand then you got to factor that in.
Also to counter point you can't earn nterest safely on BTC and you can't get internationally recognized  credit either.
Bitcoiners really need to stop comparing bitcoin to fiat as a whole and focus on the niche where it is actually useful. For example a lot of supplement companies are being given heel by CC processors because of the sale of peptide based products that are not illegal. This is where you should be directing your energy not trying to compare a Fiat 500 against a mack truck for its ability to move objects around.

How is bitcoin useful to someone like Amazon over something like Netteller or Skrill which they also do not take?


Yeah of course, hopefully my miss universe awatrd will be paid in BTC as well.


But those area's are not Amazon they are dodgy pill sites and things. If you mean things like blocking Nigeria or something that will be just as much a problem for BTC as any Fiat currency without the paper trail.


Dude, it has been 6 years and the only thing that has gone up is the mining difficulty and price. In terms of usability bitcoin has not changed much. The net transformed between 1995 and 2001.


Course it will just ignore the slide downwards the price has taken since gox went boom.


Are you trying to play buzzword bingo? Bitcoin has been around 6+ years and is failing to make a dent. It is not having a civil war over blocksize etc. Blockchians may be useful but those do not have to be the bitcoin block chain.
Keep believing true believer but the simple fact is that bitcoin is tiny (in the grand scheme of things), has not changed much in 6 years and when it tries WW3 erupts amongst the userbase and it's uncontrolled nature makes it something most companies would not want to touch

That is a tiny part of the complaince needed. What standards are there data protection to? What are there DR plans to? What external audits have they had down? If they even look at payment cards are they PCI\DSS compliant? What staff training have they done on these issues? What vendor contracts to they have in place to provide coverage? What is there change control procedure? etc etc. 
Being a financial carries a massive overhead in compliance risk and if you deal with anyone who is non-compliant you fail compliance as well. If bitpay were compliant to the same standards as a UK bank then there "hack" would not have happened due to airgapping of different systems and various checks along the way.

Cash is fine if it has history. If you can show them accounting records that show how you acquired that cash legally, for example say you walked into a casino, made a stupidly long bet and won you would have the receipts etc.
Most businesses prefer to stay away from cash as it is a ballache to secure, keep track of etc. So even a business that does a lot of cash trading (i.e small shop) will deposit to a bank account. 
Of course that is in theory, in practice they might just choose to walk away as you might be considered a risk. Also it would still need to be logged somewhere for AML purposes.
For OP to get his BTC sale accepted he would probably need to show where they came from i.e mining or price purchased and from what company (which is difficult given some exchanges). Then prove that the money used to buy mining rig or original purchase was legit and where from then finally all the stuff from coinbase he already has.
When I bought a house I had to provide bank statements showing where the deposit came from and payslips to show normal wage. Some of my deposit actually came from gambling sites but it is fully legal in my country and i was doing matched betting at the time (free money, no risk) and they didn't even raise an eyebrow.

Bingo, so why do they need to implement BTC again when most of the world is happy with using credit\debit cards?

HOLY CRAP you are sourcing from the Daily Express? What are you over 70 and afraid of yogurt? 
They have the journalistic capability of a wet sandwich FFS.
OK here is a counterpoint as an EU citizen i say "we have smuggled millions of people into ISIS held territory" and it has as much credibility as there source.
Of course they are going to spout all sorts, it is called propaganda and has been done for a very long time. The fact that a fear mongering paper like the express picked up on it makes it even more funnier. Did you believe the Iraqi Defense minister when he kept saying "there are no enemy troops here" when they were fighting about 10 miles away?
Are you OK? I mean you read the express and fear brown people, would you like a nice picture of Diana (the other thing on the express most of the time) or would that make you sad? Should i get your Nigel Farage Plushie?
It's OK the world is a scary place but not everything you read in the papers is accurate and true. Diana died in a car crash, you won't get cancer from powerlines\muslims\lightbulb\whatever else they will claim is causing it this week and the bombers that hit the UK have been mostly white anyway. Even the 7\7 ones were British Citizens.

Nor will this abomination. So it produces a trickle (actually whats less then a trickle, a drip?) of BTC and costs money to do it. But wait the maig is in the super API that lets it do stuff! Except that API is running on the PI and access the hardware wallet for things.
So everything this can do a computer\phone could do with a wallet with bitcoins in it. They just can't generate them themselves but at this things tiny hashrate it is not going to be generating much either. So instead of having a PC+wallet or a phone+wallet that lets you do other stuff you have this thing that does one thing and does it poorly (150GHash max? in 2015?).

Yes USEFUL tech. For most companies bitcoin is not useful and so is pointless. Just like they will translate their pages into most commonly spoken languages but not the language used only by a tribe in the amazon. Bitcoin is used by a tiny minority of Amazon customers so why bother? You seem to think they should integrate it to boost bitcoin which is the opposite of what needs to happen.


*sigh* Amazon are famous for razor thin margins and there is going to be a cost of integration yet you ask for a discount? That alone shows just how much entitlement is happening in the bitcoin world that you thing you deserve a discount because people have no idea how credit card fee's and chargebacks work. 
I can't remember when overstock announced but its share value is on a slide down. Also the technical implementation is a small part, then you have staff training, legal and compliance to deal with.


Outside of things like porn or shadey businesses chargebacks are not an issue. This sub thinks chargebacks are killing businesses but they really are not.


You mean in the previous post where i showed each of your paragraphs and responded to them? How in the hell is that "picking and choosing" if anything presenting them with the quotes shows that i am not trying to take your words out of context.
Keep beliveing bitcoin has some use to these big companies. Overstock did it for free PR and look what it got them sod akll sales and a partnership with a company that got itself under federal investigation (BFL). Why woud any company choose to implement a system used by such a limited amount of people that can be bought to it's knee's by a "stress test"? There are plenty of payment methods beside bitcoin that amazon don't take as well it just is not worth the effort for them.

Purse works by having people buy stuff from amazon using stolen credit cards and charging you in BTC. You get a discount because they need to cash out the stolen credit card fast.
A guy on here ordered from them, and got raided by the police as his house was the one stolen goods were shipped to.
purses response pre raid was that "Amazon has good fraud protection" and "there have been no fraudsters on purse" then saying in the same thread that they had banned 3 people for using hot cards.
Post raid they offered to pay the legal fee's.

It is a poor miner strapped to a raspberry pi. If this was the first bitcoin ASIC sure lots of slack but it isn't even worth having at todays difficulty.
Whatever business models you can come up for on this thing can be done on a PC with a wallet. The ability to generate BTC itself is kind of moot when the hash rate is so low. Remember they are quoting 50-150Ghash, which probably means 150 is only achieveable overclocked under cooling fans etc.
You are right the T does not have to be a small thing but it generally the implementation has to be cheap to warrant adding internet to it. This is why Intel bought out the Galileo and others, full spec systems for cheap.
This is why BLE is being looked at for location based services rather then RFID, it is more accurate at a cheaper price point. That is the sort of services IoT will encompass. This thing adds nothing new, they couldn't even be bothered to make their own ARM board and are charging $399 for a Pi shield.

I say this as someone on a verified signature track (9 courses long+costs money) but don't put too much faith in the value of those completion certificates.
The uni's involve make a point of saying they are not actual classes and do not entitle you to say you have studied at uni X. They also will not do much for the HR CV sift etc.
The real reason to do it is for the knowledge you earn rather then the certificate. Use this to build up a portfolio or stepping stone. For bit coin if you want to be a consultant you would do well to look deeper into its workings and write papers on it, actual proper papers. If you can do stuff on blockchain rather then bitcoin you might even get that published places, that is worth putting on the CV.
Also if you don't know how to code now you can't really call yourself a cryptoconsultant as you would be bought in to help companies integrate into their platforms and such. If you are young enough go to Uni and do Comp Sci and use your final year project to really wow them on bitcoin\blockchain.

Oh you believe the old "sleeper cells " bullshit. OK here is an interesting thought experiment for you, remember the beltway sniper? Locked down DC into a state of fear while they were active? Turned out to be two dudes with a rifle, right?
So if Al Queda\ISIS\Enemy of the month have sleeper cells all around containing people willing to suicide bomb themselves why not just hand them a rifle (which they can get relatively easily in the states) and have them pop civvies in major cities all starting on the same day.
Imagine the terror that would cause if it happened in the 20 biggest cities in the U.S (so 40 people) plus htye can be wired to go boom if they are caught for good measure.
Hasn't happened yet though which is strange because it is an extremely cheap and easy way to cause terror in any western nation. How come the U.S was supposed to have all these "sleeper cells" but all they do is sit around playing CoD all day or something?
Sure there will be criminals and extremists because in that many people there always will be. You could take a slice of any race\religious demographic and find the exact same thing (i.e Florida Man).
ISIS work on blitzkrieg, they hit a place and are constantly moving. They don't do long term planning even on the battlefields they are fighting. They tend not to hold towns but make it difficult for someone to retake it (booby traps, stay behinds etc).

The blockchain research in financials is inwards looking. It will be looked into as an alternative to existing systems that are closed. it is also key that they say blockchain and not bitcoin. None of them are going to use bitcoin for anything useful when the entire thing is outside of their control.

The UK is not Disarmed, there is Gun Control. Big difference. You have a right to a shotgun and the police have to find a reason to turn you down but you also have to store it correctly and when off private land have to make sure it is unloaded and secure(stored in a locked metal gun case at all times to stop theft etc). Rifles require a use (target shooting, hunting) and require a registration of each one.
They are still easy to get providing you have no major criminal record and appropriate storage to stop them being stolen. My dad had to fit a house alarm for his ages back.
Pistols are outright banned (except antiques so you could have a wild west revolver) but if you think you can over throw a government with them good luck.

Lets see: Newspaper article Ver uploaded says 20 times the legal limit for fireworks, manufacturer calls them explosives, they are written on the product as explosives, Ver agreed they were explosives (in court) and did federal time for selling explosives through the mail to unlicensed people.
So I think i will go with the majority that they were explosives. Oh and your M-80? If he was selling those same problem:




Not sure where you got the power comparison as the article Ver uploaded claims they had up to 1 gram of explosive material and legal M-80's as described below are in the milligram range but hey ho.

Yep in terms of sysadmin the old Helldesk route in can be done without a degree. 


Agree. Lots of people go and do say Film Studies and doss around. Very few actually learn and produce thier own mini films etc whilst there with an aim to actually becoming a director or whatever. See also Drama, Psychology, Music, Business Studies, Jornalisim etc.
It is what you do with it. Lucas did film school and mad a short that became THX 1138 whilst there. Many others go, pass and end up at Starbucks. If you don't have the drive or passion for the field any degree is useless. Even a STEM degree is useless if you are not interested in it's applications.

2) Your phone, PC and your bitcoin miner all contain things such as tantalum which has been fuelling wars in places like DR Congo for decades.

Wow that is a brave thing to say in this sub, kudos! The problem with the first example is that there is nothing but a few lines of code that makes bitcoin rare and useful as a store of value. If we created alchemy overnight the gold price would tank but it would still be used in electronics, heat reflection and jewellery. Worse case you could make a solid gold baseball bat and rob a store with it.
If something replaces bitcoin there is nothing backing it other then momentum. Companies like Nokia and MySpace can tell you how well relying on that works out. Even then Nokia still probably had a ton of patents that were useful.

People with a brain wouldn't spend $400 on a raspberry pi with a wart on it. It does nothing a normal computer\pi can do and the mining chip is irrelevant as it is too low power to out run its power cost.
Plus even if they suceed and put one of these in every electronic device what happens to the difficulty? So yeah either way the fail, Either it is an exppensive shield or they become successfull and the difficulty goes through thew roof so these chips barely mine anything.

Everyone. Some of the worst people on here for unrestrained hype are the ones that have been here the longest. Ignore my account being a year old, i have been around this sub at least 3 under by old one (that i nuked) and involved in bitcoin since late 2010. 
It has always been just as bad on the forum and a lot worse at times because of the reddit vs forum format. 
Everyone should take a look at if they want to make a quick buck, have bitcoin succeed as a currency or a store of value. If you just want to make a quick buck, fine, nothing wrong with that just be honest about it.
Some of the wedging bitcoin into disasters has just been disgusting and does nothing for it's image. This sub's blind euphoria and the owners of bitcoin companies that play to it cause more damage to bitcoin then any regulation a government could come up with.
Bitcoin does not have to be joined at the hip with a certain form of politics. take i bet i could post over there and kick off a console vs pc war or a console vs console thread. If i tried to say "streaming will end all televison this year" it won't blindly get upvoted to the front page.
People come on and pretend to be bankers, or have spoken to these mythical bankers. I work in financial networks and i can tell you banks are looking at blockchains but not bitcoin as anything other then an experiment. It carries way too much baggage and won't square with the regulations EU banks have to follow.
If I made a long ass post detailing exactly what i know, what regulations etc it would be downvoted to oblivion. Someone on a throwaway comes along and claims to be head of a canadian bank despite spewing obvious errors to anyone that has ever phoned a bank= front page.
TL;DR if people want to get rich quick just admit it, if they want bitcoin the technology to succeed, cool! but don't do the first claiming you are doing the second. This sub in general needs some critical thinking (i worded my first post the way i did because i wanted to convey it is not aimed at the sub and by extension the mods but all the individuals involved)
@_date: 2015-11-22 08:40:51


No they don't. Bitcoin needs the mining arms race to stop someone being a jackass on the network. Internal chains can run capped mining (with no reward just to hash then spread blocks) because you have to meet certain standards to be let on. Faster Payments has no form of mining but a load of rules and SLA's you gets you fines up the wazoo if you miss them.
Mining is part of the trust side of the equation, if you trust everyone involved (i.e non public facing chain) then you don't need to build out a massive infrastructure. Bitcoin works just as well at low difficulty as it does high difficulty. If we still only had CPU miners bitcoin itself would not have changed.

You keep telling yourself that. Vendors on Amazon don't receive credit in Amazon money\vouchers they get it in local currency. I used to sell through Amazon so if it is sold UK it is GBP if Germany Euro and when i take it out it converts at the bank.
The only legitimate use case they come up with for such deep discounts is Mturkers who are paid cents to to small tasks. Now ask yourself this: If the Mturk market was big enough that a service that lets you cash out into a currency as small as bitcoin is in anyway profitable then why do you not have local's doing it for rupee's or whatever? 
Would be simple to setup even in African countries using M-Pesa in exchange. Instead they all want to turn a refundable and traceable thing (CC money, Amazon gift cards in your case) into something non refundable and difficult to trace (bitcoin). Odd that huh?
So what if one fraudster buys newer card info then the other? Those deep discounts are not turkers who are already paid peanuts and know full well how amazon pays out. They are people urgently trying to turn a card into BTC for whatever reason. Maybe they take a 25% hit because they need BTC right then for DNM's or something but i doubt it.

The Economic incentive that is not there unless you are stealing power in China...


That is because DC's are built to strict compliance codes and have strict access controls, HVAC, back ups and fire protection systems. Unlike bitcoin data centers where i have yet to see a single picture where i can't spot at least 3 or 4 basic rules being broken (and why they catch fire)


There are plently ways to manage resources. Hell I know one that can make a change to 1000 network devices in a change window, check everything is ok and confirm the change where they used to use a human...


Er no. Any insitution would use a private blockchian so they can adapt it as needed. Look at the Civil War over block size and stress tests constipating the network. That does not square with SLA's most DC's provide.

If you liked that check out the book "Outlaws Inc" by Matt Potter where the guy flew on some of the shady ex Soviet cargo planes that Viktor Bout owns (one of the people Nick Cages Character in the film is based on.)
It focuses on the IL-76's that turn up whenever serious stuff is about to go down and how the crews basically live in the planes and go job to job. Also if you strip out extra weight (things like lifeboats etc) you get and extra 14 tons of cargo capacity. Guess what they use that for?

Right, got it. Cheers for the explanation. How is this Tor by default though? Seems a bit of a misnomer to me.
It sounded a bit like Tor and Core were bundled so if you launch core it launches TOR and then starts syncing up. That is what i thought reading as "by default" rather then "it will use it if it is there"

Yes and I also grew up with guns and black powder rifles and pistols, again all of which are restricted and have to be stored in a suitable safe by law.
The fact he didn't consider them a threat is a BAD thing. It is like the idiots who wave guns around, just because they think they are safe to do it doesn't mean they are.


No but using a cell phone whilst driving (unless using hands free) makes you a gigantic dangerous asshole to those around you and is also illegal in a lot of parts. So same thing, endangering others because you don't think it is a threat.
The things were 20 times the limit of what a firework would be, they had explosives written on the box, explosives written on them yet he still maintains they are "fireworks" despite doing time for selling explosives (prettty sure one sale was to underaged kids). It is not just the damage he could have directly caused that get's considered but the damage down the line i.e if some 12 year old blew their fingers off their hand because they too were being a dumbass.
He tells a story of how he was railroaded by the state. However if you go to the court transccripts it falls apart rapidly. Most of it is standard legal stuff but there were also things that i haven't mentioned here as they are to do with him personally. I would urge you to go find the transcript page and take a peek most of the time is family issues and complaining about cougth medicine not some anti state rhetoric. Then judge his actions since especially when talking about this event.
He still refuses to admit he did anything wrong (but he did in court), claims it was his politics and the judge was against him when actually the judge seemed quite open minded and so many other inconsistencies he has done to play to the crowd of this sub.


It is irrelevant. The law doesn't let you drive drunk so long as you don't crash. If you drink drive and get busted, you get busted. This is because it has to take into account the potential danger to those around you as well as yourself.
What he did could have caused serious damage to an apartment complex, if those things were "1\4 stick of dynamite" or not he would have killed himself had they gone up and could have caused structural issues to the building. Like i said overpressure and not some massive fireball is what kills\ damages places. Movie like explosions with flames everywhere are not how it works in reality.

Just about every piece of enterprise networking gear can spot TOR and flag it and has done for other a decade. So they might not see what you are sending but they can see it and kill it.
 A VPN can also be seen but are usually used for more benign things (i.e foreign business people).
So Tor+VPN might let you go somewhere but again it really depends on how far they want to take it. The penetrating of the great firewall is a political hot potato rather then a technical one. Think about people doing business in China how they would react with no email for a week etc.
Technically China could block much harder then they are doing especially as some vendors are currently facing lawsuits about special "Chinese" editions of network devices. Now all these vendors produce devices that have a "lawful intercept" model but the China specials have even more features\power.
Before some smartass pipes up "Lawful Intercept" is a specialist model and depending on the vendors employee's can see the source code of the normal models.

College is what you make of it. You can use it to spend your time using the access you get to academic journals and library's of information to study and research or you can do keg stands every night or sit and learn dead and useless languages\maths systems (Tonal, Esperanto etc.)
Plus I guess when you are sick you don't go see a doctor (college graduate), who might prescribe you a drug (either initially developed at and\or by college graduates).
This is then tied into a healthcare system that is being constantly enhanced (there are lots of research grants for IT in healthcare). You then take it to a pharmacist that double checks everything is OK (also a college graduate) who then hands you the cure to what problem you need.
If you need further testing the devices that they use will somehow come back to fundamental biology and physics research initially performed at colleges and evolved into end user devices.

It would leave you open to a legal minefield as well. Despite not knowing what is flowing through your TOR node if you are taking payment for it then it makes it very hard to argue you are not a service provider and should be taking all relevant steps.
Running one now is dodgy enough to cause some people to get raided, only to be told "sorry we bad" later. 
I mean it's all relevant but remember the links to unsavory material someone shoved in the blockchain? Technically that could get virtually every bitcoin user in trouble especially countries without robust free speech laws and laws around having to decrypt on demand. No one is going to bother because it will likely not have enough evidence to go all the way and can be argued that no one has control of what is put on the chain.
However once you through money into the mix, especially in terms of being rewarded for participation that opens up whole new avenues of law you can get hit with.

Every thing else be it x86,x64 or ARM is general purpose compute. So yeah a general purpose processor is not going to be better at hashing bitcoin then an ASIC based system but it works the other way. If you are going to measure in pure compute power the desktop PC's alone probably account for a significant order of magnitude more than the bitcoin network in terms of processing power.

Wait but won't bitcoin have to come out of TOR at some point? You are not going to get corporate firewalls to run TOR through, so unless I'm misreading this you are saying Bitcoin traffic remains inside the TOR domain?

True. The fact still remains though they were likely on a plane at one point which is against FAA rules (even for basic fireworks) and planes are super thin and full of other things that can cause an issue. They might not be that dangerous on their own but its the effect that could potentially happen from being mildly annoying to downing the whole thing. [You can see the effect of one in this video]( these were the model Ver was selling


No I am not. The damage explosives cause in the real world is not the big balls of fire you see in the movies but the overpressure caused in the air. Now an apartment complex is different to a house in construction methods but many U.S buildings seem pretty flimsy to my European eyes. 
If it was a wood,stud,drywall type construction chances are it would blow through things. I honestly don't know what the apartment is likely to be made of but i will say bricks and mortar. Still when you create overpressure in a confined space it has to go somewhere. It could have blown out the window, it could have blown out the floor above, who knows? Secondry fires and structural damage could have been an issue. They could have gone off through no fault of his own, say the neighbor sets light to there sheets or something smoking, an unexpected boom is not what firefighters need.
If we were talking about an industrial unit somewhere it would be a totally different conversation (and he probably would have a much lighter sentance) but it was residential and he endangered those around him.


I used to work at a store that sold Fireworks for bonfire night (nov 5th). Now this iis in the UK and the only fireworks a non specialist place can sell are tiny in comparison to what Ver was selling and what you can buy in America where legal. We still were required by law to have a thick metal storage trunk with blowout flaps that was locked at all times (it might have been bolted to the floor, can't remember) and have it checked by the fire department. 
Ver stuck much more power then that next to his bed in a normal cardboard box. Like i said it could have been nothing to do with him that could have caused them to go off.


He has done his time for it and that should be enough. However he has chosen to lie about many facts around the trial to play to the crowd that were dis-proven when the publicly available court records were posted.
[Here is a photo of what he was selling posted by Ver himself]( The box clearly states "Warning explosives" and "Store in a secure area". The article (again posted by Ver states they were 20 times over the legal limit allowed and therefore explosives not fireworks plus it is written on them explosives and on the box.
[Here is an article where Ver clearly is lieing to make himself seem a martyr]( The relevant section's:
It says:
At the sentencing the judge asked me if anyone threatened or coerced me in any way to sign the plea agreement. When I said “Yes, absolutely,” the judge’s eyes became very wide and he asked “what do you mean?”
What actually happened:
THE COURT: And has anyone threatened you in any way in order to cause you to plead guilty in this case?
THE DEFENDANT: It depends on how you define "threaten," but I would say no, Your Honor.
Bit of a gap there huh?, also the judge on the case seemed to have no problem with Ver's politics:




He also left out a lot of stuff that i won't cover because it is personal. Make your own choice but realize he has repeatedly lied for personal gain and this is something covered by independant court recorders.

Care to elaborate? Because not trolling here apart from some adoption (that has then been backpedaled on by some) Bitcoin  has not achieved much in it's 7 years of existence economics wise ( the tech is interesting but the article is about economics).
If anything it is proving an exact model for why a deflationary system is bad with people in this very thread still saying "HODL". Many people in this sub to not want to spend it for fear that they will miss a massive price spike, which when they occur are hyped up a lot.
This makes it a poor currency choice (because no one wants to spend it) and a poor store of value (because it should not spike up or down that much in short periods of time). If anything Bitcoins contributions to economics (again put the tech to one side) is a working proof of why deflation is bad. The only group using BTC as a currency on a regular basis regardless of price are the DNM crowd and i don't think you want to put that argument in front of an academic committee

Yep those third worlders have plenty of bandwidth and storage space to run bitcoin. M-pesa being so simple it runs on old Nokias was not deliberate or anything.


Those are two seperate things and most progressive places make it a requirement that banks have to offer you a basic account. They don't have to give you credit etc.
Failing Anti money laundering rules is a use case for bit coin i suppose as drug money needs to go somewhere.


Bitcoins makes this better how? 


Course they do if you count all the people living fo less then $1 in the worlds worst places. Somehow bitcoin is not going to be for them yet M-Pesa and equivalents took off like wildfire...

This is why that one exchange had someone walk off with thier server. In comparison I had been working in a banks DC for 4 days, on the last day they refused me entry to the car park (high fence electronic entry) because my changes had not yet been approved.
It wass raining, i was on a motorbike and knew the security guys so i begged them to just let me park up and get into the non secure reception (because they have two) and it took some convincing but they did. I then got on the phone and got my requests pushed up as emergencys whilst dripping all over the carpet.
I was the only engineer on a motorcycle, they had seen my ID (Camera ad mic outside) and knew who i was and that i would be there all week yet protocol still meant they couldn't even let me park. The guy told me he broke three regulations letting me into the external reception (I repaid him and securoity crew with loads of munchies later).

The FAA forbids the transport of fireworks\explosive cargo. The example showed how oxygen candles were put in a non sensative hold which did not require smoke detectors so burned and took down the plane.
Again even 1 or 2 of those going off in a wrong class hold could cause mayhem on an airplane. Go look at one that has been cut in half at a boneyard and realize how thin they are. Now throw in potential for a smouldering fire. Chances are it would be in a hold with smoke alarms now so the plane could divert but there is a reason they are banned from mail routes via plane.

No U.S Politics is a choice between two evils. Other countries often have more then two parties, i think there were 6 on my last voting slip (with more then 7 in parliament).
American's moan so much about how politicians are so alike then keep voting A or B. The UK just came out of a coalition between the Tories (think moderate Republicans) and the Liberal Democrats (Liberal does not mean what Americans think it means, Think of them as like ultra accepting democrats)
Those two are at the complete different ends of the political spectrum but it enabled the Lib Dems to influence the Tories to a certain degree. Of course in doing so they sold out some of their key audience and got slaughtered in the last election.
Key point though is you don't need to be A or B. The internet makes it even easier to get your message out as you don't need to pay for expensive TV slots to run stupid attack ad's.
The other good example of this is the EU Parliament. It is elected proportionally so a region has a set amount of seats and they get split according to vote %. This means you have the normal suspects from each country+ a hefty dose of Greens, a couple of pirate party memebers, some far right anti EU parties etc.
So if you want change get someone to run as C and get behind them on all levels. Americans get to vote on everything way more then most other countries. Stop voting Democrat vs Republican and mix it up a bit. Eventually the big parties see where votes are going and move position, this is why in the UK the Tories played to the UKIP(who want UK out of EU) crowd.

The American legal system is built around plea bargains. He wanted his day in court and it back fired massively. 
Welcome to the real world, you tend to get much shorter sentences if you say " i am sorry for what i did, i realize what i have done was wrong and i accept responsibility for my actions" This works outside of court as well, covering stuff up in a job is  much worse then going in and saying "i messed up"

Maybe grouping random women you have just met and then patronizing them is normal behavior for you but not for me. Maybe I am just weird


Wait is it bad apples or normal behavior? I also said it happens in other area's as well.


OK so back to normal human trait again must be weird as i don't go for someones leg if they sit next to me at a tech conference nor do I assume the women speaking at such an event is there because she is someones wife\girlfriend. Weird i know.


I was providing further examples of this community in regards to how women are viewed and treated. oddly a lot of other subs don't have this problem and a lot of others do. It is possible to talk about a subject without bringing someones gender or looks into things.


You seriously think branding another human being for life with a QR code for payment is something any normal male would do? That was the suggestion not that the tattoo already existed. I guess you also think a trade show is pointless without booth babes around?
A " Bitcoin Wife" who is very pro bitcoin says the communities are toxic and off putting and you still don't see how all this relates to the demographics of bitcoin?
A women photographer (who turned out to be a scam) posts and a large number of comments were variations on "i'd do her" and nothing on her work etc.


Right, so because some parts of Reddit act like horny 13 year olds, everywhere should? talks about changing the world but i guess that only applies ~50% of the population. The others should just go to Odd how other subs don't really care about gender and can talk about the topic in hand.
You claim to be "really sick of this 'white male' shit." but think nothing at all needs changing that could make bitcoin much wider accepted and not off putting to large chunks of the population. I'm not talking about affirmative action or even being PC but not acting like schoolchildren could go a long way to help adoption.

Person A creates a wishlist of stuff they want to pay BTC for. 
Person B uses stolen CC to buy it for Person A.
Person A Pays Person B in BTC at deep discount (because extracting money from stolen CC's is worth taking the hit)
Purse sit in the middle and make money on connecting the two sides. Now scroll forward a month or two and Person A has an issue like OP, Amazon now know the item was bought using a stolen card (card company will call it in)  and they know where it went (Person A's address).
So Person B now has some BTC to exchange for whatever they want and leaves Person A as a patsy. Guess who Law Enforcement are likely to visit first?

The comment about reddit came from a women who is pro bitcoin. if that is a pro bitcoin view imagine what a neutral
egative view would think of this sub\ bitcointalk.
The article shows there are people that either feel entitled to group or patronize. This is not isolated too bitcoin and has cropped up at sci-fi conventions, skeptics conferences etc.
Then you have this subs general behavior which is off putting and is at times only a level or two above 4 chan's "TITS OF GTFO"
Now take all that and mix with the lopsided nature of niche STEM subjects that exists.


Indeed, but as i mentioned above if you know you are going to get shit why bother. Look at the effect Gamergate has had on female game dev's, some leaving the industry, others going dark etc. Why say you are female if you can expect treatment like that?


Lets take the relevant passages:


 
The bitcoin community is more lopsided because of the points i made above, it is also tied in to rand paul\libertarianism\ayn rand etc. 
Rand Paul is a pro-lifer that will put of some people, Ayn Rand thinks its ok to punch a women in the face if she is a moocher and not everyone agrees with libertarianism. When people tie bitcoin to these ideologies they are alienating those people not interested in those ideologies who can write it off as "another libertarian gold bug thing" rather then digging deeper into what bitcoin is. This applies to both genders


Go to a bitcoin conference, get groped or patronized. Come online get told to cam model or be called gay or much worse
 


Criticize bitcoin and prepare for holy hell. Someone accused me of a heinous crime for pointing out purse have been caught engaging in card fraud without any evidence. Why bother getting involved in something so niche given all of the above?
So back to your question, bitcoin has plenty of white male supporters\critics\interest already. People already involved with bitcoin are interested in it to varying degree's but mostly make up one demographic. If you want mainstream adoption you need to appeal to a wider demographic regardless of gender\race\sexuality. Just because he said "White males" does not mean all White males are on-board with bitcoin but that it's small niche is dominated by them even though the numbers maybe tiny overall.
If bitcoin wants to suceed mainstream then maybe the community should consider:
* How it acts around others, the sidebar link and any topic involving an adult site taken bitcoin usual dissolve into teenage beavis and buttheaad levels of "Herr Boobs"
* Decoupling from a political view not shared by many. Nothing says you have to be an An-cap\libertarian to be interested in bitcoin but if you read this sub it would seem that way
* Start treating people equally at conferences. I mean is this one really that hard? My fiance has a business in a very female orientated field but that doesn't mean she gets to patronize every man that walks in and say "oh did you come here with your girlfreind?" or cop a feel.


This is absolutely true but when there is something that you don't need to be a part of and the community makes no effort to make you feel welcomed then people are not going to bother.
The niche my fiance works in actively welcomes males in but is still heavily female leaning. If bitcoin communities\events can't even make basic efforts to engage those outside the niche (especially given the points above and catching some of the gamergate flak) it will stay as it is and that is what the guy was complaining about.
Examples: 
[Top voted comment: tattoo QR code on strippers](
[Financial conference? Bring in scantily clad dancers](
[The original abby bitcoin thread]( complete with comments like






[Women of Tinder talk bitcoin]( including:




Plus somewhere on bitcoin talk is the "Why aren't more blacks into bitcoin" post of cringe.

but it kind of negates the cap a bit. A dollar is only divisible down to 100 units (conventionally) so 21 million dollars would leave a max of 21,00,000,000 that could be used to pay for things with nothing cheaper then one of those units (without rounding). 
Making it divisible so much means the hardcap in terms of the consumer makes little difference. Who cares if it is 1 BTC or 0.1 BTC if the relative price is the same? It is proving the critics of deflationary economics right though in that instead of spending and encouraging use people are screaming HODL and hoping for another price rise.
It is like if you buy a Ferrari 250 GTO you know there are only X in the world and there won't be anymore so they are constantly rising in value to insane levels. If you bought the last Ford Crown Vic of the factory line and kept it hermetically sealed for 50 years it would rise in value as they are iconic cars but it would not be worth the millions a GTO would be because so many are made.
You see this with Miata's\MX-5's. First generation ones that only have delivery miles are selling for more now then they did new but not much more because tens of thousands of the things were made.
To your gold analogy that is why it is sold by the troy ounce and not bar\coin. There is a small amount of gold in the world but it can be divided down and sold at spot rate for the smallest amount. Like you say it makes it more usable but it is not some magic guarantee of value that people in this sub think it is.

Look I don't know how much more clear i can be. [Read this article posted by Ver himself.]( It states that the items in question were 20 times more powerful then the legally allowed limit for "fireworks" this is why they are called "Explosives".
He also posted the photo below it, clearly showing a box saying "Warning Explosives" and the product in question which also has "Danger Explosive" as if it was somehow a dangerous explosive item.
They are not fireworks they are used to deter pests and are only available to people with appropriate licenses to use for that reason (again Vers posted article states this as well). They exist solely to explode and make noise, no pretty light effects or anything.
So are you seriously saying that something that is legally classified as an explosive and not a firework, has "warning explosives" on the main carton and even has "Danger Explosive" on the actual product in pictures posted by Ver himself is not an explosive?

DUCK, flying goal posts incoming...
The only way the U.S provided arms to ISIS is the ones they picked up when the Iraqi army high tailed it out of there in the early stages.
The west are supporting the Free Syrian Army and affiliated factions, The Russians are supporting the Assad regime and are barely touching ISIS to force a choice of ISIS and Assad.
Hezbollah and Hamas are also involved in the south of Syria and are definetly not getting U.S funds\ training. 
Some of the neighboring countries helped ISIS in the early days but the U.S never did and have been critical of them without naming names (likely Saudi Arabia).
But hey never let the facts get in the way of a good rant.

I know what inflation is but the point remains the cap has zero effect on any consumer. So what if there are 21 million available when you can divide it to however many decimal places. Nobody cares if something costs 1 btc 0.1 btc 0.01 btc if the relative price of the item stays the same.
DNM's are proof of that. Most users really don't give a damn about the price of BTC they just know they need 0.5btc for drug X. When the price goes down they need 1 BTC etc.
Also central banks tend to try to keep things like inflation in check so you don't have massive price pogo's like bitcoin because a national currency actually matters. Things like wages also tend to rise with inflation meaning to the average person it is not a big deal until the two get well out of whack.
Now take bitcoins supposed "deflation" whcih leaves everyone screaming HODL terrified they might miss a bubble so not spending it. Which stifles uptake and furher chokes he price lower in a nice cycle that economists have said would happen in deflationary periods.

You wouldn't even get near the server before your ID and things are on file. So you would have to basically treat it like robbing a bank with marked bills exclusively. Remote access is also policed just as much.
A bitcoin exchange is pretty much a bank. It has your personal data, financial data and your wealth (btc) all in one place. No bank does that, swipe a server from a bank DC and if you get through it's encryption etc you might get some tx and personal details but no actual money.
IIRC someone literally walked out of a DC with an exchanges server containing a wallet.

You either have security or you don't. Once you have physical access to something there is always some way to get info out of it. All you can do is police the physical access as much as possible.
It's like if you wanted to steal a MiG-29 (they can be self started as a defector did without a groundstarter), you can jump in and if you know which switches and buttons to press away you go. Now try to get to the flight line of an airbase and see what happens.
It is a nice idea but i can think of a few attack vectors on this, the key looks like a RFID for one so super easy to copy if someone was targeting you (this could be done by someone driving by you or walking near you as has been shown on passports). It has an Intel Processor which the likes of GCHQ\NSA etc will analysis to death etc.
I don't buy the whole honeycomb either, for it to erase data when the thing is powered off it must have some form of battery. Also you would need to overwrite the data to make it non recoverable. How long would it take someone to yank the honeycomb and yank the battery? Or pull the SSD completely?

Crossbow, axe and knifes are fine. Anyone can own these unless specifically banned (probation terms or something). However you cannot carry them in public without a good reason. Going to and from an archery range with everything backed up in your car is fine, walking down the road with it slung over your back is not.
Pepper Spray is classed as a firearm and banned from civilian ownership. Tasers are the same, a normal Taser gets you up to 5 years, a concealed one (i.e shaped like a flash light) up to 10.
Guns are controlled by licensing IIRC for a shotgun you have a right to it and the police have to find a reason to turn you down (if all conditions are met, see below). Rifles you need to prove a reason for ownership (hunting, target shooting etc) to justify why you need it. Pistols are banned completely(except antiques and black powder type ones) following a school massacre in the 90's.
To get a firearms license in the UK you need a secure storage cabinet that must be fixed to a solid wall (i.e not plasterboard) and make other things to ensure they will not be stolen (like a home alarm). All ammunition and firearms must be stored in the cabinet and locked when not in use. You will also be visited by a member of the local police to confirm everything checks out.
You need to file 2 or 3 character references from people in relevant positions (i.e the owner of the gun club if you are target shooting, the farmer you do pest control for hunting etc). The police will also conduct a criminal background check on you, minor crimes are not an issue (speeding etc) anything violent is an automatic NO. You cannot buy ammunition or firearms without your license and each gun must be registered with the police when purchased.
THAT is what he is doing 6 years for which is a light sentance considering he had a zip gun, shells and pepper spray with a violent track record.
So yes he could legally own everything except the zip\pipe gun if he met what i laid out above. Airguns under 12ft/lb's of impact (enough for bunny hunting) are also uncontrolled.

Yeah that is what i meant on the location front. No matter how hard the crash places like London or NYC will always bounce back. Other places in large nations like the U.S are a bit different because there are plenty of other spaces to go to. For example Vegas was only useful initially as a railroad\telegraph stop(IIRC it is on the limit of the old telegraph systems length), then a fuel stop then they legalized gambling and now it is a huge resort but should gambling be legalized U.S wide it would shrink drastically. 
Compare to say Paris where they can't build tall buildings because the whole city has been undermined with unrecorded mines of gypsum (IIRC). So unlike most places where you can knock down a few low buildings and build a great big one it is impossible so property will always recover.

So throw it out then, don't know why you keep it around in the first place.


[Of Course not]( ! Even Pua Pyland, better known as the Bitcoin Wife or Mrs. P has said " This is then further exacerbated by the volatile monetary side of Bitcoin, where women are typically risk-adverse and less likely to invest. And socially, the Bitcoin community has existed on thread boards, IRC, and Reddit - all places that are notoriously not very female-friendly environments."
So you take a STEM topic (which has a lopsided demographic), throw in some weirdo's (not all bitcoiners are like that but it only takes a few) and the community being toxic and you further push the demographic one way. If you want any further examples go look at some of the backpage+bitcoin posts, plenty of "hurr durr boobs" type comments.
Then add to that the whole Gamergate politeness towards women on places like reddit or the fun Ellen Pao had and see what might be keeping people away.

It really isn't. Most big companies went to CFl bulbs long before the public and the same with LED's. When new soloutions for things such as IT are put into these big companies the first two questions you get our "how will this affect are business goals" and "what savings can it make". 
Most big companies are now beginning to experiment with Wi-Fi analytics to turn off heat in rooms no ones in etc and they have had motion detector lights everywhere for years. One large bank has even stuck boards in the old gaps between the racks to reduce air bleed between hot and cold aisle. All this reduces the cost of operating the infrastructure.
Solar PV is not a panacea. If you don't believe dig a bit into Germany. They have an excess of electricity around midday due to the massive subsidizes PV got. When then creates a problem as traditional plants need to throttle back and restart later because mass energy storage is a pig to do. There was even an IEEE white paper floated around about pluging commercial DC's into the grid so that when the power price went above a certain point they would use the emergency generators to put power onto the grid  (burning diesel) rather then spin up a gas or coal plant.
PV is great in California, Arizona etc but pretty pisspoor in most of northern Europe and small scale wind has a lot of problems (noise complaints, maintenance).
Sometimes it is better to go for the low hanging fruit then the big end goal. Sticking large amounts of roof insulation in is more effective then putting up panels and extra heaters (in cold climates). For companies really basic stuff like turning down the IT infrastructure over Christmas can save $100,000's for essentially free.
PV is fine when it is sunny but you can't adequatley store the power unless you have huge amounts of land for pumped hydro. By comparison a nuke plant will tick along quite nicely producing less CO2 and radioactivity released into the air then a coal plant (seriously). All you got to do is work out how to store the waste safe.
Gas is a major issue in Europe. The bulk of it comes from Russia and allows them to act like dicks. The problem is other plants can't spin up and down as fast as gas. So PV everywhere is great during the day but crap at night and wind is too unreliable as well. You will need to rely on some other form of power generation to balance them out.
This is were France has been smart. The bulk of there power is from nukes then hydro then wind/pv. In the mean time virtually all the EU nations are subsidizing energy efficiency programs to insulate old buildings, implement smart meters, outlawing incandessent bulbs etc as these measures are easy and have a much bigger impact then PV everywhere.
Of course the other option is the one the co-founder of greenpeace is in favor of. Burn wood for power and plant more tree's making it carbon neutral. He got booted out for that because cutting down tree's is sacralidge even though it would mean more forest and better forestry management
Edit: Forgot to mention no pro chef will ever cook with an electric hob. They are a real bitch compared to gas because you can't adjust the heat on the fly. So most ovens here have electric oven and gas hob.

Aside from Goxcoins though. Someone like Bitpay or coinbase could do the exact same thing if they chose to.
You are forgetting that fractional reserve is what allows people to have things like savings accounts with interest, loans, mortgages etc. You know the stuff the modern economy needs and ends up going haywire when removed (look at Greece when cheap credit disappeared).
Your "fake" money is used by the bank to generate the profit to pay the interest on your savings account. Your balance reads $1000 but part of that $1000 is loaned to someone else as part of their mortgage, they pay interest payments on that which then get distributed back to you. Your $1000 is not locked, you can get it anytime you want and in most off the western world it is insured.
The financial crisis happened because they gave loans to people who were not suitable, defaulted and tipped the whole equation out of order, not because fractional reserve is fundamentally flawed.

Umm that is enougth to start a burn that then lights up the internal boards of the miners, the plastic fans etc. These guys found that out the hard way: 


A DC fire suppression system will pick up the rise in temperature or other triggers caused by fire. Electrically isolated the cab (and those nearby) then dump water on it. Because most things are not powered when the water hits they are salvageable. A fire would breeze through a design like that and take out whole chunks with ease once started.

Oh dear god:
* Those better be ethernet cables on the floor and they be better be shielded or your going to get cross talk
* Cables running at head height
* Flamable materials in emergency stairwells
* No sign of any fire suppression equipment
* Eating in a DC floor? Hello contamination (although i doubt they are doing any air filtering by the look of it)
* Using garage shelving and not racking, no consideration to spacing the heat
* Every miner crammed together
* Not a single cable over rack cable tray
* Using a home spec PDU for industrial power
* Noisy as fuck, no hearing protectors.
I could go on but ffs it is like they want the place to catch fire. Given they are sleeping in there that could be fatal

Assuming it is good grade cable, which in all honesty it probably is Cat5E at least it should not be an issue. More through luck then judgement.
Older cable though even twisted pair bundled up like this causes interference on the cable enough to drop the frame. If there is power cables in there then holy balls fire and interference risk.

You still need to pay attention to thermal placement. Breeze cooling is not open air and when the big boys do it (google have a DC with no HVAC in Belgium IIRC) it is still filtered air.
It will also be tied to all the safety controls so if a fire starts it does not get fanned into a massive fire. This place doesn't even have a sprinkler system with electrical cut. Fire control is probably a guy named Chen with a hand held CO2 extinguisher.

Nah a lot of DC's are upgrading to Biometric. It has caused SLA issues where an engineer has been sent out at short notice and not on the biometrics so not let in or refuses to be printed/scanned.
The rest is rubbish though. Theye likely Co-Lo'd in various places that advertise as "being underground" and think that makes them more secure then above ground. It doesn't and if anything make you less secure given most underground places are ex military and likely still in the big list of "places to bomb the crap out of if things kick off"

They put in Mi-Fi devices they owned and built on a service they own. If you own and build the hardware this is trivial to implement. 
If you don't own any of the hardware or service you may as well try to care a life size statue of liberty from your own ear wax, it would be more legal, useful and class as art.

Both points are irrelevant. i also work in an area of Cheshire famous for having a massive amount of millionairres in there and guess what cars i see. Houses in tiny villages go for vast sums. I live in a rural community where with 30 miles you have mostly working people and the very rich (for example one of Status Quo and one of the Top Gear presenters live within 30 miles of me)
Even if they have enough spare cash to sleep on a bed of USD, hryvinas, Rubels or Yuan why would they want to buy BTC as opposed to other stocks, bonds and securities? One is 6 years old and is on a pogo stick or you can put a chunk in the S&amp;P500 and pretty much get a safe return ?
If you are rich enough to buy a lambo you probably have savings earning a decent rate without having to worry if a chinese miner decides to call it a day and cash out.

No they shut down non compliant financial entities as they are require by EU and UK law as well as internal risk management. Go find a bitcoin business that has passed ISO 27001 and PCI (if they go anywhere near cards), has full 24x7 support and is regularly checked for compliance to financial industry standards that they have shut down.
Btcoin businesses are often not setup as financial companies, use "company in a box" setups when hey can even be bothered to register as LTD companies, do not have any policies in pace (change control, DR, security etc) and are often doing things that would be flat out illegal in the financial world (i.e bitfinex front running on their own market) plus they are super risky because they go belly up faster then henchmen in a bond movie

However, since our **risk assessment system and regulations** have changed, we are no longer able to accept any international forms of payment.
DING DING DING This is what it comes down to when dealing with financials. Banks don't manage money they manage risk and this is why many don't want to be involved with Bitcoin.
are you PCI DSS compliant or do you back off the card handling to a processor?

To get a credit card you generally need to be the same age as you would need to be to buy porn. So if you pay by a CC that is legally yours you pass a further age check.
You could of course be using a visa debit, your moms card etc but generally these places work on CC's being a big factor in confirming peoples age.
Bitcoin can be held by anyone. Like i said it only takes one pissed off parent and your going to get all sorts of legal bullshit thrown at you.
