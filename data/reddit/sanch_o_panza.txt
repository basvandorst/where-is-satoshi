Are you aware that ABC is written in C++, BCoin in Javascript, Bitcrust in Rust, ... ?
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:22:38
Did you find any such service?
@_date: 2017-03-31 14:54:00
I disagree completely, but I submitted it to the development list to get their opinion on it. Maybe if something is so clear to you, you can explain why my proposal is not strictly a superset of BIP9 features?
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:49:21
Well, thanks for your work on Bitcoin!

I understand that you might feel personally aggrieved by my choice of words. Still, it is not a personal attack on you, as I have said before.
It could turn out, like some have suggested, that I'm wrong and the mail was blackholed by the list server. That does not excuse the lack of response from the BIP editor to my request for assistance in finding out what happened to it, nor the false accusations that I faked the submission and email headers, nor the unprofessional attitude that you display here.
There could be other possibilities here:
- rogue moderator censoring things without you noticing
- technical problems with the list
So lay off the 'false accusations' and perhaps realize that to me, as someone who just submitted to the list for the first time, it is perfectly reasonable to start believing that my proposal might be suppressed when I don't receive any reply from the editor, and received a reply from the list which indicated that it had seen my proposal (the auto reply from the list owner email which included the test of my submission).
At the very least, you (moderators / list admins) should clarify why I received a reply from the list owner account if indeed my submission was trashed because of spam (which is the current theory being put to me).

Yes, of course you may ask!
It was about generalizing the BIP9 scheme to allow finer-grained control of signaling and activation of forks.
Something that could e.g. be used to restart signaling for SegWit on another bit (e.g. bit 2) with a lowered threshold.
You can search my history at for the details - I submitted the full proposal text to some subs.
You could also ask Luke-jr because I copied him the full submission text in the mail I sent to the BIP editor address.
Of course, there would need to be discussion on the mailing list to get the full details of such a proposal worked out. I just submitted a rough draft with the idea and motivation for just this purpose - to get this discussion going.
I am planning to re-submit it later today. Hopefully my email "sanch0panza can be whitelisted.

As I indicated to brg444, the full submission text is in my posting history, as are the context of my enquiries around this.
To get more context, I have provided an 'assemble-yourself' link below which links to the full text. You need to eliminate the spaces.

My actual reply to you which I made 40 minutes ago here does not appear, I think because I used a word which only you as a wizard can use.
EDIT: this one : 
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:21:31
It is not the answer I was looking for, but thanks for engaging in this conversation with me. Maybe what you suggest is what I have to do.
If you don't mind me asking - are you a Core developer?
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:11:09
My proposal makes no assumption that backwards-compatible changes are the only ones that can be deployed by the versionbits signaling, that is correct.
Actually, my proposal allows the versionbits to be used for future Bitcoin Core changes which are not backward-compatible. For example, flexcap, or many other items on the HF wishlist.
This is just one of the possible __benefits__ of this proposal - it makes the versionbits *more useful*.
I don't know what you find patently absurd about it.
It is still up to the users of Bitcoin to signal for changes of their liking. The proposal does not force protocol deverlopers to do something in a more restrictive way, it offers them greater freedom to use the existing bits.
@_date: 2017-03-31 13:21:33
For example, the one who told me to "get lost" when I raised a question about my submission to the bitcoin-dev mailing list not appearing.
Or the current BIP editor who did not reply to my enquiry about the submission.
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:27:07
I was raised by ordinary, common sense folks.




"might have just gotten spam filtered"
And no-one is able to look if this is the case, and provide definitive proof?
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:16:54
Allowed only in the sense that Bitcoin is a permissionless system.
I disagree about it being a stupid waste of time, but this is a matter of opinion.
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:48:55
BIP135 is a generalization of BIP9 which allows separately configurable threshold percentages/window size and grace periods for each versionbit.
