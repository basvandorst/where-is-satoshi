Chip and pin is not required. The clerks just don't know how to do it.

Have you thought about looking at public xively data?  There's probably already a lot out there.

The only thing that I've had go wrong is that I've accidentally sent the transaction twice to bitpay.... and they don't give you the second one back.
Mine was for a small transaction, but still kind of annoying.  The blockchain iphone wallet transaction didn't go through (gave me an error) but it eventually did go through...

Coinbase isn't  an exchange so does it really apply?
Time and time again people get caught leaving coins in a web wallet... Buy them at coinbase if you have to but immediately transfer out.

i was about to say the same thing... updating via apt...
it didn't help LOL

As long as they sign the letter it should be fine. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 12:54:24
You have to have them sign a letter saying it is a gift.

Today, after several weeks of silence on the status of the 10,000 chip bulk orders, Yifu Guo posted on Avalon’s web site a story of extortion in china. Several weeks ago a team member’s personal information was identified and family members were intimidated. Reportedly, the malicious party was threatening Avalon team member’s safety if their demands for payment were not met. The radio-silence during was attributed to their evaluating potential solutions and implementing new security procedures. Also included in this report is an update on the status of existing pre-orders, as well as a discussion of their future plans.

I don't exactly understand how the website works. I just use the online wallet for taking in coins then transfer stuff to a paper wallet.

Break even of 32 days without electricity?  Not too bad of they deliver and you can front the 20k
@_date: 2013-08-07 02:02:04
Rough. Sounds like a normal amount of money to be going through there. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 02:36:42
Waiting for the first story about one where everyone gets arrested. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 21:58:51
it is in the article

Actually, selling at mt. Gox prices is a great idea. Just not buying.

Blockchain app works fine for me. 
@_date: 2013-08-02 18:33:30
Believe me... I know that drill.

Gliph has coinbase integration that will let you send coins to other gliph users with your wallet.

Hmm... I have a problem spending them since the value always seems to be going up. How do you get bitcoins?  Paid in them?
@_date: 2013-08-02 20:37:34
But that's why they are selling it at an ATM for gox + 10%   Agree you wouldn't want to ever expect to get cash out of gox. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 16:52:35
I think it is because it is hard to get cash out of gox. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 18:11:59
i don't think it actually went!
@_date: 2013-08-31 20:31:07
Ahh. I thought that transaction on bc.info was for .6 btc. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 21:05:02
you guys failed to mention people working for avalon having their families threatened by extortionists!  this is crazy if true.

Kevin Rose posted this on his twitter feed today, so I guess that is the google ventures part.  It looks like they have a large legal presence.  Hopefully it will enable the flow of fiat in and out while staying in the regulatory space.

this does require the bazaar to be covered by wifi or cell service though, right?

i have three, and will not see roi on them.  it is an interesting experiment that was fun to put together.  i already had a raspberry pi laying around, and i did the adafruit/piminer thing.  i also have a jalapeno on order, and will probably add it to that too.
this is all in the context that i don't actually use bitcoin for anything!
@_date: 2013-08-07 01:54:28
Business or personal account?
@_date: 2013-08-08 12:34:39
You could probably do it with an iPhone and an app bra use so few people would actually use it.

That's an expensive Xbox live code!

They probably just don't want to deal with anything that isn't totally routine. Unfortunately, most big banks are probably going to be like that.

I thought you weren't supposed to tip in Germany....
