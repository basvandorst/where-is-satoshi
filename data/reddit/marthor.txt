I've made many purchases on Overstock through Coinbase and never had a problem. There's nothing wrong with using an intermediary when circumstances call for it. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:02:06
BTC, XMR, LTC, and BTC Platinum are all cryptocurrencies.
XMR, LTC, and BTC Platinum are altcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:03:30
All altcoins are bad. They are just pump and dump scams for whales to take Bitcoins from retail investors. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:31:55
Bitcoin's fees are high only when the miners are spamming the mempool with junk transactions. When they aren't spamming the mempool, Bitcoin transactions cost pennies.
So the problem isn't something unique to Bitcoin. If miners were spamming BCH or LTC transactions, fees would be just as high for those coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:59:54
I was hoping this thread would be about switching BTC's proof of work algorithm.
But, nope, just a Bcash shill.
Larger blocks would do *nothing* to help scale Bitcoin. Blocks are full only because miners are spamming the mempool. When the mempool isn't being spammed, blocks are practically empty. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:41:36
The vast majority of these recent transactions are spam from the miners who are trying to drive people toward Bitcoin Cash. If you look at the beginning of the chart, you will see what Bitcoin's mempool looks like during normal use. The transaction spam is the *only* reason that Bitcoin transactions are slow and expensive right now. Without the spam, it would cost pennies to get your transaction confirmed in the first block. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:07:41
Nothing. Litecoin is a scam.
Luke Dashjr offers a good critique: 
Of course, since that post was made, Litecoin now has ASIC mining, and the hardware is sold by Bitmain. That's yet another reason to avoid it. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 06:50:29
Actually, Bitcoin dominance is now less than 1% because I created 100 trillion Super Duper Coins (SDC) and sold two of them to my brother for $5. We will be listed on Etherdelta shortly.
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:34:22
Yes, but I doubt that ASIC manufacturers are still using S9-tier hardware. The S9 came out two years ago and produces only $3 a day in profit at a power consumption of 1300 watts. It's a very bad deal to run one of them, which makes me strongly suspect that new S9s are not what is causing the Bitcoin hashrate to continue to skyrocket. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:01:08
This doesn't seem healthy to me. It suggests that mining is possible only for a few people who have the most efficient hardware.
Bitcoin should change its proof of work algorithm to level the playing field.
@_date: 2018-08-02 06:15:47
People are free to make their own altcoins, but they are all worthless, except for Monero, which serves a useful purpose until Bitcoin develops better privacy features.
Too many people make the mistake of thinking that having multiple cryptocurrencies is just like having multiple computer companies or multiple car companies. It isn't. It's more like someone saying, "Hey, these rocks are valuable too!"
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:54:55
There are tradeoffs to different algorithms.
Memory hard algorithms are more resistant to ASICs but can cause clients to slow down because they are harder to verify. (This was the case for Scrypt, at least.)
If an algorithm isn't memory hard, then it will quickly become an ASIC-only algorithm. Some experts, like Luke Dashjr and David Schwartz, believe this is desirable.
I agree that more research needs to be done. I think a hybrid PoS/PoW approach should be explored as well.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:02:54
I can't agree more. As much as I love Bitcoin and want to see it grow both in value and adoption, I do not like seeing this sort of parabolic growth that is clearly not the result of organic supply and demand. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:24:43
A 1% fee to move hundreds of dollars seems pretty good to me. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:05:54
There is no problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:57:32
Bitcoin's block size is more than enough for organic usage. The only time blocks are full is when miners are spamming the network or abusing BCH's difficulty adjustments.
As you can see, the spikes occurred during 1) the New York agreement, 2) the first BCH pump, and 3) the second BCH pump. I'm not sure what the March 2017 spike was, but I'm sure it was related to some push for larger blocks.
In between the manipulated spikes, you can see that Bitcoin's mempool is very small. This means that Bitcoin's current block size is more than sufficient. 
Off-chain scaling is the real solution to increasing Bitcoin's throughput. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:30:22
If you increase block sizes, mining pools are just going to add more spam transactions to fill up the larger blocks.
Increasing the block size solves nothing. We need off-chain scaling only, and fortunately, most Bitcoin users are wise enough to realize this. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:06:13
Yes, .2% fees with zero confirmation transactions are entirely possible if miners aren't spamming the mempool. 
However, it will be much more efficient to take these small transactions off the main blockchain. Coffee purchases don't need to be stored in nodes forever. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:06:42
Short term solution: Wait for the Bitcoin Cash pump to fade.
Long term solution: Lightning Network so that people can transact Bitcoin without going through miners.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:14:25
The problem with bigger blocks is that there is no need for bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:54:10
Ok, by that logic, altcoins such as Litecoin and Ethereum are better than BCH. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:45:40
A block size increase isn't in the best interest of the vast majority of Bitcoin users. 
It doesn't matter what a bunch of miners and businessmen want. The Bitcoin users and the core developers are the ones who make Bitcoin what it is, and that is why Segwit2x will fail. It's just said that they won't concede gracefully and instead are launching a replay attack.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:40:22
Because no one cares about altcoins. BCH is just a tool for SHA-256 miners to pump and dump. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:24:07
First of all, when you're buying something cheap like coffee, you don't really need any confirmations. This means transactions are essentially instant.
Second, coffee purchases don't need need to be included in the blockchain that is running on everyone's node. It's far more efficient to make these purchases through an intermediary such as Coinbase or BitPay or to make these purchases through sidechains, which is what the Lightning Network intends to do.
Whatever the solution is, it does NOT involve on-chain scaling. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:23:33
Yes, BCH is a nothing but a scheme to enrich SHA-256 miners. 
It's an annoyance, but there's no doubt that BCH will fail in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:46:57
Do you really think that Bitmain and Roger Ver are going to walk away from with pump and dump with *fewer* Bitcoins? Not a chance.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:48:50
I'm relatively new to crypto and had no idea who any of these figures were earlier this year. But it didn't take me long to realize that the Bitcoin Core developers are the ones creating innovative improvements to Bitcoin, while Roger Ver and the big blockers are selfish con artists. This conclusion seems so obvious to me that I have to wonder how many of these Bitcoin Cash supporters are paid shills or sock puppet accounts. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:10:01
No one is working against the miners. Segwit and Lighting Network are improvements to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:25:08
Lower fees because no one uses it.
If BCH became as popular as BTC, then miners would just fill up the 8mb blocks with spam transactions.
Larger blocks are not a scaling solution. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:45:02
BCH is a scam, which means you are more likely to lose money from it than to gain money from it.
Trading is a zero sum game. You aren't going to win against Bitmain and the whales who are pumping BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:26:20
That's what I'm hoping. BCH miners are getting 40 blocks an hour, which gives them a strong incentive to pump up the price. At 6 blocks per hour, hardly anyone would mine BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:54:00
If the core developers and users support a proof of work change, then it would still be Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:07:00
Correct. Blocks aren't even close to being full when miners aren't spamming the network or pumping BCH so it drains all of BTC's hashing power with its corrupt difficulty adjustment algorithm. Organic usage of Bitcoin is coming nowhere closet to filling even 1mb blocks.
Also, if we increase the block size to 8mb or whatever, there is nothing stopping miners from just filling up the blocks with more spam, since it costs nothing to them.
Larger blocks do nothing good for Bitcoin and should be avoided at all costs. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:07:47
They won't be picking up any sooner now, thanks to the attack by Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:50:43
There have been thousands of altcoins created with trillions of tokens collectively.
There are still only 21 million Bitcoins at most. 
I don't think his argument holds water. The best arguments I've seen against Bitcoin also apply to all non-fiat currencies -- that only fiat is backed by violence, and violence is what holds society together. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:02:59
They are launching an attack on Bitcoin and they will fail yet again.
Roger Ver and his minions will never win because they offer nothing of value to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:30:54
BCH and BTC have the exact same use cases.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:02:14
Creating a fork of Bitcoin is actually the fairest way to make an altcoin. 
The real issues are that 1) Bitcoin Cash is worthless at best and potentially dangerous at worst and 2) it has led to perpetual pump and dumps so that miners can abuse the difficulty adjustment algorithm. Miners led by Bitmain, Ver, and associates occasionally pump up the price of BCH, mine a huge number of blocks (the average for the last three hours is 26 blocks per hour), and then dump those on the market at the inflated prices. After the dump is over, Bitcoin Cash will lay low for a while and no one will mine it, which means no downward pressure on the price. Eventually, they'll decide to repeat the cycle. 
No one benefits from this except for miners. We should seriously consider a PoW change. At the very least, make sure to sell all of your Bitcoin Cash and never buy it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:21:23
How do bigger blocks help with that? Block times would remain the same. It's also highly unlikely that the 1mb limit is currently being reached with legitimate transactions (as opposed to spam transactions designed to incrase fees and create a spurious argument for larger blocks).
If you are concerned about Bitcoin's throughput, then stop supporting Bitcoin Cash, which is stealing SHA-256 hashing power from Bitcoin thruogh its corrupt difficulty adjustment algorithm, and stop supporting miners spamming the mempool.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:51:11
My thoughts?
Total scam just like every other ICO out there.
There's no reason that this application needs its own token -- they can use one of the widely established cryptocurrencies already out there.
Also, an endorsement by a YouTuber is not a good sign.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:20:32
The scammers behind BCH will dump it long before then. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:55:22
If you capitulate to these scheming miners, then Bitcoin is dead.
I don't see the current "attack" as a big deal. I welcome these attacks. Bitcoin needs to be continuously stress-tested. If an altcoin pump and dump causes Bitcoin to collapse, then it's a failure.
The long term solutions are to 1) increase off-chain transactions and 2) change the proof of work algorithm.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:35:47
My guess is that Bitcoin would go down pretty dramatically. During crashes, people flee to low risk assets with high liquidity, such as cash or treasury bonds. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:15:40
By that logic, every altcoin is a side chain.
And as a corollary, BCH is the least useful side chain/altcoin because it shares SHA-256 mining power and adds no new features. Other altcoins add features like anonymity and faster blocks and do not compete for Bitcoin's mining power.
BCH is utterly worthless.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:35:52
Hopefully what will come out of this is that more people will realize that Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, and their henchmen are selfish, greedy people whose ideas should not be followed.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:40:02
Increasing the block size would increase the data requirements for nodes and in turn increase centralization.
Also, larger blocks would just result in more spam transactions.
So the reasons to avoid on-chain scaling/block size increases are 1) lack of efficacy and 2) creation of node centralization.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:05:53
Yes, .2% fees with zero confirmation transactions are entirely possible if miners aren't spamming the mempool. 
However, it will be much more efficient to take these small transactions off the main blockchain. Coffee purchases don't need to get stored in nodes forever. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:45:09
Because there is no need for larger blocks. Typically, it's not a good idea to try to solve problems that don't exist. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:21:34
Bitcoin is about freedom. People can use it however they want to. Blockchain ensures that everyone plays by the rules.
For what it's worth, I think Bitcoin trading on Robinhood is a great thing and it's perfectly reasonable for them to use IOUs instead of settling all trades on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:46:01
This is why we are smart to resist the argument for bigger blocks. The mempool isn't close to being full under normal use.
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:44:40
With PoS, a unit of currency that you acquired several years ago for a couple cents is just as effective at producing new coins as a unit that you purchased recently for $300. 
With PoW, you need to constantly reinvest in mining equipment if you want to earn block rewards and transaction fees.
The mechanics are completely different. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:11:57
We will undoubtedly see the same emergency difficulty adjustment with B2X as we saw in BCH. The ultimate outcome will be the same though: B2X will fail. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:22:28
Altcoins have gone down relative to Bitcoin, so buyers are paying less. I recommend that you just keep mining -- whatever amount of BTC you're earning today will be a lot in the future. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:48:50
You are correct. PoS rewards people who acquired their coins for next to nothing. 
An Ethereum token that was acquired for 30 cents will be just as effective at "mining" as an Ethereum token that was acquired at $300. This virtually guarantees that all of the stakers will be insiders, which I suspect is what most PoS cryptocurrencies actually want.
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:36:23
Wrong again.
Most PoS stakers are speculating that the value of the coin they are holding is going to rise. They would be willing to hold the coin without PoS, so there are no opportunity costs (or very little).
PoW, however, has real opportunity costs in the form of hardware, electricity, storage, and maintenance. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:31:05
Many, if not most, miners will continue to mine BTC because it will likely be worth substantially more than B2X. Signaling means nothing -- miners follow the money. If block times are longer for a few weeks, then so be it.  
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:04:12
The author contradicts himself.
He starts by saying that Bitcoin has no use except as a money-making scam and as a tool for criminals.
But then he goes on to acknowledge that Bitcoin is useful for people who live in countries with oppressive governments. Isn't that a legitimate use? Economic freedom for disenfranchised people is a good thing, right? (It's similar to how Jamie Dimon admitted that Bitcoin is better than fiat in countries with hyperinflation.)
You can't argue that something is a scam and then concede that it improves the welfare of at least some people.
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:16:30
I meant that the Bitcoin Core developers could fork BTC with a different proof of work algorithm. All of the development talent is with Core, so people will likely follow them instead of Segwit2x, which has one developer. 
But then again, this isn't going to happen because BTC is going to be worth far more than B2X. Also, hour long blocks would be fine for a few weeks. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:11:38
If Segwit2x becomes Bitcoin then many if most in the community will consider decentralized cryptocurrency to be a failed experiment. 
Fortunately, I think this is as likely to happen as an asteroid hitting the Earth tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:55:03
Segwit2x keeps losing momentum. At this point, it's likely to be a non-issue like the Bitcoin Cash fork was.
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:22:50
Core could change the proof of work algorithm to something that isn't mineable by ASICs. This is the Doomsday scenario.
The most likely scenario is that BTC will be worth substantially more than B2X. If certain mining pools don't want to mine BTC and leave millions of dollars on the table, then they can go right ahead. Enough people will mine BTC to ensure there are enough blocks for transactions.
There is simply no chance that B2X will become the new Bitcoin. And that's a good thing because it would likely be the end of cryptocurrency if it happened.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:52:44
No, that's not how it works. The chain with the most amount of work isn't necessarily Bitcoin. If the longest chain produces work that is rejected by honest nodes (which will be the case with 2x blocks), then the longest chain is not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:01:21
If people value BTC more than B2X, then miners will mine BTC. It's as simple as that. Miners follow the money. 
And as a hypothetical, in the incredibly unlikely scenario that no one is mining BTC, the core developers could create a PoW change that would bankrupt the current SHA-256 miners. This would be disastrous for Bitmain and the rest of the B2X/BCH supporters. The only scenario in which miners will stop mining BTC is if the price of BTC plummets relative to B2X, and the chances of the happening are incredibly small.
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:19:42
Yep -- miners aren't going to leave millions of dollars on the table to support what will likely be a failed altcoin.
Also, even if only 6% of miners are mining Bitcoin, things will be just fine. Bitcoin with two hour blocktimes is still much better than an ill-conceived altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:24:59
People will quit mining, the difficulty will go down, and then profits will go up for people who are still mining. Mining will always be profitable for at least some people in the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:30:43
Transaction fees are occasionally high because miners spam the network with low-priced transactions. Without the spam, Bitcoin has low fees with its current block size. Blocks aren't even close to being filled.
Also, the people behind the spam attacks are the same ones pushing 2x. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:30:39
There is no chance that Coinbase will call Segwit2x "BTC." That would likely be the end of their status as a top exchange (assuming that a Segwit2x victory doesn't destroy Bitcoin altogether).
Miners can get away with an attack because they have monopoly. Exchanges do not, so they have to yield to the community. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 06:41:26
Two altcoins are going to be created using the Bitcoin blockchain as an initial distribution -- Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Segwit2x. There are no Bitcoin hard forks coming up.
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:23:11
NiceHash isn't cloud mining though -- it's essentially a hash power exchange. It's certainly not a scam.
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:05:47
There are numerous reasons.
A simple reason is that all of the talented Bitcoin developers are sticking with BTC. All of the future innovation will occur on that chain. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:47:10
Almost 80% of Ethereum was pre-mined and distributed to a small number of early investors a few years ago. A handful of people control the entire currency. The Ethereum Foundation itself has 13%. 
Conversely, all bitcoins were acquired through a decentralized proof of work system over the course of nearly a decade. It was a relatively fair distribution (imo, Bitcoin's distribution would be a lot more fair if the issuance hadn't been so skewed toward early adapters, but it's still much better than a massive pre-mine and ICO).
