Which paragraph of the letter refers to bitcoin as the reason for the account being closed?
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:14:55
I think you are losing sight of why currencies exist in the first place. People want a standard with which to do trade. Sure you might have pumpkins and I might have tractors, and sure you may want a tractor, but what if I don't want pumpkins? We need a tool with which you can buy my tractors and is value of me to purchase something which I do want. Gold fills this gap.
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:06:45
In a world of financial turmoil, gold *should* be the stable foundation which people turn to when currencies are volatile.

I work in the industry and have worked on HFT projects in the past. Your comment seems to match what I have stated, that it is only the big Wall Street firms (and hedge funds) which can do this. It is not thousands of programmers.
@_date: 2014-08-18 21:31:43
Automated trading is very different to HFT.
Anything which is relying on arbitrage is going to be extremely expensive and competitive with a very small number of people seeing success. It sounds like what you were doing is something different.

Laundered **through**, not **by**.
And the answer is that these banks did not have appropriate AML checks and processes in place.
Now we are discussing a bank which does have appropriate AML checks and processes in place and you people still aren't happy.
I guess people just love to complain.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:39:53
It isn't an accurate analogy though.
A relatively small number of people losing 40% of their investment is not comparable to the global impact of the financial crisis, or what would happen should one or more of the biggest banks fail.
If the bigger banks fail, then it creates a chain reaction which cripples entire countries. We already saw and experienced the damage of them nearly failing. We saw how every sector and every market was impacted. Hundreds of millions of people felt that impact and it is something which will be studied for centuries to come.
MTGox failing is something which almost no-one will even know happened and in a month's time only those who were directly impacted will remember it.

You cannot simply label the present as "irrational" because the outlook is negative.

I haven't invested anything into Bitcoin and I will not notice any impact at all from MTGox failing. That is why it is not "Too big to fail".
I don't have any investments in the mega banks, but when they came close to failing, I nearly lost my job and hundreds of thousands of people who also had not investments in them *did* lose their jobs and homes.
That is the difference between a tiny company like MTGox and big companies.

All you are doing is repeating garbage.
$2b is $2b. It is a lot of money.
Also, since you wish to throw allegations around like you've just come from which specific executives laundered which money? You don't have a clue.
@_date: 2014-01-28 06:14:07
You sure can. It's great that we can all have different opinions. That doesn't validate them at all, but it's cool that we can think different things.
For example, when something is a record high fine, and is more than most companies are even valued at, and is about 100,000 times more than most peoples networth will ever be I consider it a lot. But I guess for you a fine isn't significant unless it shuts down a company and forces 260,000 people into unemployment.

That's how settlement works. The prosecutor agrees to drop the charges and the other party undertakes some lesser punishment/fine.
It is actually how the vast majority of legal cases are resolved and works well when the prosecutor is not confident of a successful trial.

I'm so sick of garbage which reddit spews about this every day.
1) HSBC were fined almost $2b dollars and have made agreement to fix their process, something which in itself has cost over $1b. This is not a "slap on the wrist". That is a huge amount of money.
2) HSBC were never proven to have known that they were assisting money laundering. They were never proven to have committed any crime.
3) Shrem has been shown (but not yet proven as the case is ongoing) to have known that he was assisting money laundering. He will be proven to have committed a crime.

Energy markets are almost entirely seasonal. Retail is largely seasonal.
You are not a trader.

I agree completely that the fundamentals haven't changed, however the price of bitcoin has not been driven by any fundamentals for years.

With equal respect, the U.S. really does set the path which other western countries follow when it comes to the regulatory space, so when you see things like the CFTC decision, that will very heavily influence other markets.
Going further, US regulations often apply to all businesses which wish to operate in the U.S., meaning that even companies based outside the U.S. will need to abide by U.S. regulation if they have any operations here

Yes, however New York Times is a news website which does not place emphasis on subscriptions like Reddit does. Comparing the number of subscribers is like if NYT was to compare advertising views. Reddit has very few ads because that is not their model just as subscribers is not NYT's.
Further, these 4million subscribers are largely there for the generic content which I have already stated most people are there for - not the niche places like Even further, there is a difference between number of visitors/subscribers and having influence. New York Times has actual poilitical influence because the quality of content there is of a respected nature and the readership are generally more influential people themselves whereas Reddit has very very low quality content on average, and the readership have little influence.

Here's an entire paper on it: 
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:03:22
This is true, but you also need to factor in things such as the cost of living a satisfactory life.
If it costs a person $20K/year to house, clothe and feed themselves, then they are not very likely to gamble their last $20K even with slightly better than even odds. The difference in happiness between trying to live on $0 and $20K is much bigger than the difference in happiness between trying to live on $20K and $40K. 
However, if someone has $1million then gambling $20K is not such a big deal since the difference between going from $1m to $980K is not very different to going from $1m to $1.02m
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:49:12

It will continue until JPMorgan, Visa, Federal Reserve or some other much larger, better connected organization decides that the public is ready for electronic currency and releases a solution which is used globally by mainstream vendors.
Bitcoin is a proof of concept, not the end solution.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:59:27
That is a safe thing to do - this does not necessarily make it the smart thing to do.
At the end of the day, investments are just things with differing rate of returns. A loan is an investment with a negative rate of return which you hope to offset with an investment elsewhere. If his expected rate of return on the bitcoins is higher than the negative return on the loan, then the smart thing to do would be to keep it all in bitcoins. I personally know nothing about the bitcoin market so I would certainly do something similar to what you have suggested.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:53:45


Here's my challenge to the pro-bitcoin crowd:
Given that there are a number of financial institutions and government treasuries who already have so much power and influence in this space, why can't they create a competing currency which has actual, meaningful support from vendors and mainstream public?
What is unique about bitcoin which would allow it to overcome much larger and better backed competition?

The fact that you had $35K to spend on BC suggests to me that you are not a child, however the fact that you are coming to a internet forum to complain to a group of children about how you have been treated seems to contradict this.
If you care about your money, show it by taking this seriously and stop posting about it.

That isn't 'logic', that is a pattern which has been observed a few times in a short lived product which has not yet been challenged by a serious competitor, yet has no barriers preventing big financial institutions or governments from creating more viable products.

That is just a URL. Please actually explain where the political influence from Reddit is.
If you read that article, you'd see that it claims Reddit incorrectly decided that Paul Ryan was pro SOPA and decided to 'destroy' him and replace him with Rob Zerban.
I'm not sure if you followed the elections or not, but even with all of this supposed Reddit political influence that you speak of, the $15,000 Reddit raised didn't get Zerban even close to winning.
It should be noted that gawker, dailykos, atlanticwire etc are all just clickbait for Reddit children so try to overlook the hyperbole and look at actual influence which Reddit has shown.
