Atheose_Writing, could you please enumerate all the instances of you having sex with your wife lately. Please list all the poses and modes of a foreplay. Don't forget to attach certified measurements of your dick. Thank you for your cooperation!
It's not an invasion of privacy, I'm just asking. Nicely. The government of my native Ygtfclystolia requires me to gather this information on any person I'm engaged in online discussion with, so it's just a matter of legal compliance. We don't want to be seen as engaged in anything illegal, God forbid! So, let's comply. 
Of course, you might choose to not answer, or lie. That'll make you you a 1st degree criminal and terrorist under ygtfclystolian status DGTX-39477.9435 and they'll be following a legal procedure of sending government-issue drones to locate and liquidate you. 
Why the big eyes, most democratic governments of the world are doing it all the time!

No matter what Keynsians would have you believe, printing money out of thin air does NOT create goods and wellfare out of thin air. Otherwise Zimbabwe would be a fabulously wealthy paradise.

Well then, I cannot have any online discussion with you and your refusal to comply with the law has been reported to relevant authorities under status DGTX-39477.9435. Good luck and I suggest you start brushing up on your drone-dodging skills.

People post here about similar and other types of problems with Coinbase all the time. Almost every day, you see a few posts with complaints. I wonder why nobody bothers to make a search on "Coinbase problems" before doing business with them in the first place?
@_date: 2016-03-05 20:37:43
What's the difference? Once they control the protocol, they have legal liability to make it "compliant". Pretty compelling case could be built that this is exactly what Coinbase is after: 
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:28:41
Yeah, seems that you just don't get it. If Coinbase gets to control the protocol, it has to modify it to comply with the law - any law. Preventing 'illegal' capital flight of Chinese users? Yessir! Censuring illegal transfers to online gambling sites? Naturally! Collecting names and real addresses of Russian bitcoiners, so that they could be put in jail? You only have to ask, Mr.Putin! We'll have them rounded up in no time!
And you are spewing the nonsense about 'complying with the law' here? You do understand that Nazi death camp employees simply 'complied with the law'? Disgusting...

Indeed, it is a problem:

It is no coincidence that a well known altcoin scammer Marshall Long is a key figure behind both Classic project and r/btc subreddit. They tried to hide or downplay this fact, but there was NEVER any explanation what the hell he is doing there and what his real role is.

Bloatblockers keep re-making these bullshit charts to support their ridiculous claims. "OMG! The sky is falling!" A few months before his whiny ragequit, Mike Hearn was peddling something like this. In his projections, a total collapse was projected in January 2016, if I'm not mistaken. Such predictions will need to be revised periodically to keep FUD alive and pressing Bitcoin price down. I'm stumped anyone is STILL taking these clowns and their scary pictures seriously.

I've spoke to Bitfinex support. In case of split network, they plan to trade both types of coins. And why wouldn't they? It's more money from trading fees. Obviously, Classicoins&lt;-&gt;Corecoins will immediately become the most active crypto-forex.

You obviously do not understand how this "consensus" thing works.

Tis hopeless. There is no explaining Bitcoin with her...

r/btc sockpuppet/troll brigade back in town. This sudden "mass agreement" out of nowhere is the reason local mods have sleepless nights... ;)

You need to sign the message (either pro or con) with your bitcoin address holding non-zero balance. Most clients, such as Core, Mytrezor or Armory have a menu option such as "sign a message".
@_date: 2016-02-26 18:23:53
Trezor is the best solution. Actually, you can use a couple of Trezors - one for everyday transactions, one for long-term storage that you keep in deposit safe or somesuch.
