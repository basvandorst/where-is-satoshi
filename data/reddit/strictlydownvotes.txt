Mystery solved: I (don't remember but let's assume I did) withdrew 0.3 bitcoins to a paper wallet. This withdrawal apparently happened but coinbase did not show it because "phantom balance." Sometime later, because I thought all my coins were in coinbase, I threw away my paper wallet. It wasn't like I was going to use the same key, right? Right?
So, there's another .3 bitcoins up there in the block chain never to ever be used again.

Here are some screencaps. Intriguingly, there is now a 0.3 withdraw from my account LAST YEAR.
What is the tx history?

I think a valid story these days is bitcoin merchants stealing bitcoins from their customers.

It was empty. The money had been transferred out but then coinbase transferred money back.

Sure, if tomorrow everyone woke up thinking Cheetos are money then Cheetos would be money. In that sense, value is subjective.
The more interesting question is, "For how long are people likely to continue valuing Cheetos?" The answer is not very long for a list of obvious reasons like mass production and turning everything greasy, powdery and orange.
I still much prefer precious metals to anything else because they have so many properties lending themselves to use as a stable money. Their quantity is regulated by nature. One simply can't go out and invent a new element the way one can go out and make a Litecoin or Peercoin or Dogecoin. The problem with these digital monies is that they can be infinitely diluted by other digital monies. It's not a stable configuration.
I'm hoping for a future where precious metals are used for savings and digital peer-to-peer currencies are used for daily transactions since they have a payment system built in. The digital currencies will come and go but it won't matter because each individual won't have very many of them, preferring to keep their wealth in tangible assets.

Mystery solved:
OK, it looks like I found the address where the bitcoins went from your records:
I recognize this as my first paper wallet.
It sucks because I discarded the paper wallet after my balance showed that the coins had been transferred to coinbase. Looks like I'm out 0.3 bitcoin...sucks.

Is there an algorithm for generating a bitcoin wallet by rolling physical dice? I would like to avoid any theoretical issues with random number generation.

After a huge rise in btc and fall in silver shouldn't you be portfolio rebalancing by buying silver?

I hope there is room to be both a fan of bitcoin and precious metals. Gold has the advantage of being naturally scarce and **simple.** Bitcoin has the advantage of incorporating a payment system into the currency. I think both have a bright future. Just because bitcoin outcompeted a gold payment system does not imply bitcoin is superior to gold.

Yes. Exchanges work on the principle of matching buyers with sellers and collecting transaction fees (they don't care about price going up or down). This normally works fine because at the equilibrium price there are approximately as many buyers as sellers. However, during a "gap up" there aren't enough sellers and during a "gap down" there aren't enough buyers. Gaps up happen during euphoria and gaps down happen during panic.
Taking a look around here, I'm seeing a lot of euphoria. There's no knowing when euphoria will end. The problem with euphoria is people buy in with money that they can't afford to lose. They buy in anyway because, well, they're feeling euphoric. A gap up attracts momentum chasers - people who buy anything that's going up in the hope they can ride it and get off one station before the crash. The point is, euphoria typically ends in a panic. Say bitcoin goes to $2,000 then it would not be surprising to see it scoot back down to $200. It's still awesome if you bought at $150, and in the long term bitcoin could go to the moon...
...but in the mean time remember that "nothing goes up in a straight line."

Diamonds are made from carbon. Gold is an element.

There's nothing wrong with selling part of a speculative position after it's gone up a lot. It's logical and prudent even when you continue to believe in the investment. Even being right doesn't guarantee people will see things, or even continue to see things, your way.

If the existing miners don't accept it then they will create an opportunity for entrepreneurs to jump into the mining market. Either way, consumers win.
