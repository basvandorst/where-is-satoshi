Yes, let's do this. 
Life changes for the positive. More education around Bitcoin becomes apart of the daily routine. Still living within our means

Quick update (anybody out there lol)
Boston and New York were awesome. 
The Coin Shovel ATM at Veggie Galaxy in Boston was very fast and awesome to use. They used bitpay to accept bitcoin for meal and was very seamless. Nice work!
Had Poutine in Montreal for BTC 👌

Sometimes they do get shots behind the drummer, not sure they will use the one today. My name is Derek, drummer, coffee, Bitcoin lover who fully believes in the Blockchain and the community. Last year I used Bitcoin in 18 countries on tour with BANKS, treated our crew to dinners, coffee in Vancouver, shoes in Paris, haircuts in Amsterdam, ramen in Tokyo. Very lucky to see BTC working in the world, world wide, very happy to connect with people in the community. City to city I enjoy talking to people about Bitcoin on the road, what their perception is, having a convo. Have encourage friends small businesses in Venice beach to Tokyo to accept Bitcoin. Who's out here that I've seen before in person? :)
