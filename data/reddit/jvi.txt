I know many former Googlers and many have said that lots of managers at Google nowadays play all these games to advance their own career and end up stifling innovation.

lol. hopefully you're not serious. Linux is the shittiest OS ever, not only because of the crap driver support, but also because nobody gives a shit about it. It's also nothing innovative. Windows probably has the best kernel in terms of sophistication and performance (no surprise given the number of really smart people working on it), but it's all the bloat on top that makes it bad.

Osx is still the better os for devs, but sure waste your time using a subpar os just to prove a point. I prefer to just use the superior products for the job.

Western Union is honestly the most evil piece of shit ever. Even a 5$ fee seems ridiculous when all they're doing is taking a tiny bit of risk and a crappy service.

how much do you make a month?

dude i'm a software engineer and managing my account there is a pain even for myself. i much prefer something like coinbase, but coinbase requires way too much verification.

There wasn't really anything wrong with chanse until now...

Hmm.. not much info about this. What exactly are these things about? I do see the worth "symmetric" misspelled on the cover, which doesn't inspire confidence.

Sure, find a flaw in current cryptography (factor large primes quickly or something), and *bam* bitcoin is worthless. But, then again, we'd have bigger problems in that case.

So.. no way in hell you'll ever be able to withdraw mtgox using dwolla anymore?

WTF ARE YOU SAYING
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:49:43
Well, I only skimmed through Satoshi's paper (so I'm probably grossly simplifying), but aren't bitcoin transactions just digital signatures, which just uses public/private key cryptography. Public/private key cryptography is just getting two large prime numbers, and those are your private keys, then multiply them together and modules, and you have your public key. If you can prime factorize really fast, you'd be able to figure out the private keys.
As for bigger problems, well ssh keys become worthless as well, and you can basically hack any networked computer system in that case pretty easily.

Even better! Then you don't even need to pay.

Dude, convert it all back right now. No healthy market is going to not crash for this long.

If the prices are in BTC, then you're fine.

lol, even if it goes to 0, you only lost like 500 bucks. I've lost 30k in a few minutes before, for reference.
