It never happened even.. CNBC spreaded fake news look at Forbes response:

Too much if you can convert it to ETH or LTC to save on fees

I understand it’s a platform but what you said implies I can’t liquidate it for fiat. ETH is just as liquid as btc. Liquid = value = currency. So basically ETH is btc on steroids that is also a platform

So true...

I’ll have $5 worth of wings.. pays $5 in transaction fees

It’s like a commodity. I spent $500 before.. $40 fee and took 2.5 hours. I should have just wired. Wall Street will get smart and start investing in more efficient blockchains. Bitcoin right now is the Nokia brick phone and the dev community where do I even start lolol

Use Gemini, coinbase fees are insane in comparison
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:43:35
Or Bittrex..
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:44:36
I agree.. but moral of my story is that if I did a wire transfer it would have been cheaper and faster then bitcoin. 1-2 hours and $25 vs 2.5 hours and $40

Check the site out on mobile LOL

Meh I would diversify more

But it’s mainly used as a store of value. Also definition of electric currency can be interpreted in many ways.

Bamboozled again!

It’s what people said above but for you it’s really for developing products. For example now you can create your own bitcoin casino, or accept bitcoin in your ecommerce store, a bitcoin wallet, etc directly on your own node instead of using a 3rd party like block.io

This should clear it up for you.. its a good read. I know a guy who traded $4.2 million (he had to calculate it for taxes) on an exchange over the last year with only $50k capital. Thats some volume right there. Dude must have day traded the hell out of it.
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:24:21
The volume isn’t 100% indicative of actual buying and selling bitcoin. Could just be moving wallets, deposit and withdrawing from exchanges, etc

Look up HBSC laundering scandal and their fine was a slap on the wrist really (no one went to jail) freaking hypocrites

Then amazon adds it and kills your business.

Thanks Obama! Gov shutdown like 3 times lmao.. and your comment makes you seem like a sheep
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:48:59
Misleading. A study was done where every transaction can power like 5 homes or even more for a month. Very efficient LOL
