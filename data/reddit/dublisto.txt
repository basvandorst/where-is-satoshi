Actually, when I was working in New Mexico recently, I was looking at places that accepted Bitcoin near me and saw what had to be an escort service...

Wouldn’t he essentially be mining at the same price as his electricity costs?

I'm at the point to where I don't really even like going to bitcoin links for the suspicion that someone is looking and sees my ip and assumes I have bitcoin.  Like even talking about it on reddit haha...

Nice!  Thanks

I think I'm at the point where I should buy a legit wallet.  I think the only thing really holding people back from the general public perspective is fear of losing their btc...also, I really dont want to take advice from a guy who was throwing his private key around on the internet...even if he though it was safe.  I'm assuming there's probably better info on reddit as to how to safely store your keys...

I'm on an exchange right now (yes, that is the root of the topic, I'm aware of the risks which is why I started the thread) will there be giant fees to move them?
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:23:00
Can anyone else confirm this?  So they're buy only?
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:50:44
32.33%...repeating of course

I think if people didn't say they "were mining BU blocks," I wouldn't be confused

Aren't there a bunch of Bitcoin atms that just got out into NY?
