Not going to happen.  Governments have a lot of tools to mess with the money supply and not something they would give up by decentralizing currency.
One reason that the USD is valuable is because it's very constant with a consistent level of inflation.  This makes is globally very attractive, especially if there's an uncertain outlook.  This stability isn't created through market transactions, however.  Look at the government's bond-buying programs, which are just creating massive amounts of money.

A currency that doesn't continue to add more supply is inflationary.  
If we were on an island and we used conch shells (assuming you could never find any more shells) for currency, as the population grew, the supply would stay fixed, making the currency more valuable.  This is inflation and why governments "add" money to the money supply so that you avoid over inflation.
The real question is what does inflation mean.  Is the CPI a good benchmark?  Probably not since people consume more than a small bundle of very basic goods.

You are correct.  I meant the value of the currency relative to goods.  The point I was trying to make is that based on that, the value will continue to increase.
Anyhow, you probably are preaching to the wrong crowd.  No offense to anyone but the sub looks to be a watering hole for bitcoin optimists.
