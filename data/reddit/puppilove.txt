This sounds really dodgy, I couldn't find any information about that website and I found a few repeated posts with different accounts, but with the same structure on Reddit

I think I'm just going to delete my previous posts since this drama is getting too far. I simply just wanted to know if people weren't using SD cards anymore, since I do use them quite a lot. That's it. I'm not answering anything else after this. Sorry for this confusion and if I bothered any one. Have a good night. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:57:55
