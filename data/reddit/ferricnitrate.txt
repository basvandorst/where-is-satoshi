Did you see the AMA from that kid who had $1 million in bitcoin a couple months ago? Kid could barely string together two grammatically coherent sentences in a row but was convinced education was beneath him since he made so much from putting a $1000 gift from his grandmother straight into early bitcoin. Seems he had made a deal with his parents where he could finally abandon school if he made a million before high school graduation.
Hopefully he took the advice of the thread and put some money into safer investments or he and all his failed businesses will collapse if bitcoin ever falls.

Oh yeah, I hate idiots (at least the ones who spread misinformation and refuse to learn or even enter into discussions, you know, t_D users). At least it's better than hating entire groups of people based on their backgrounds, skin color, country of origin, or current situations like t_D loves to do...
My hate is based on merit, not prejudice.

Last I checked it was sitting in a bitcoin wallet. Coincidentally that's fortunate considering the rise of the few months it sat there but, of course, it very easily could have gone the other direction.
[Here's]( a link to the thread. Main theme is that he's done well but people hope he realizes he basically won a lottery in terms of a lucky financial bet backed by a supportive family and hope that he'll use the money to better himself.

[Found it]( As mentioned in the top comment, he's acquired some good skills for himself despite dropping out at 15 but he's sorely lacking in some important life skills he would have otherwise learned.

I bet you didn't even see the irony in that statement. The subs you frequent allow screenshots of blogs as "news" submissions. They also endorse violence and derision towards minority groups. r/politics only allows submissions from verified news sources (you can take issue with the bias of a news company all you want, but at least they're more credible than blogs). They also haven't instructed people on how to run protesters down with their vehicles...but that's something t_D loves to pretend never happened (sort of like how a disturbing number of those users deny the Holocaust but secretly really wish it happened all the same)
Try getting your news from somewhere that isn't an alt-right cringe sub or even from reddit in general. Fox, Breitbart, InfoWars are toxic garbage; CNN is also trash but at least not state propaganda; WaPo leans but has been doing solid journalism since Watergate; few take issue with BBC but coverage can be lacking. Avoid opinion pieces from the lot of em.


After you, snowflake.

I learned the hard way recently to never leave my stock sitting without a sell order. Went to lunch during the 10 minutes it broke 9k and came back to the bloody dip

Get your shitty, hate-fueled politics outta here. This place is for bitcoin and the memes.
