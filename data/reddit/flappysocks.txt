Paper wallets are a popular answer, but do take care. A silly mistake can be costly.
Hardware wallets remove the human element somewhat. Less chance of screwing up.

The EU is finished. Even the German vice chancellor said today it's a possibility.  
The nation's trying to get into the EU, want to do so because they are poor, and want a slice of the EU funds, and perks that go with it. With the UK out, the money pot just got a lot smaller. It won't happen. Germany and France would have to find the cash.
At best, the EU will reform into a trading club, which it was supposed to be in the first place. Even the UK might rejoin. But as it stands, the EU bureaucrats want to cling on to their jobs, expense accounts, and life of luxury. They even set their own rate of personal taxation, so it's no wonder they are trying to keep it going.

How do you know the bitcoin used for child porn, doesn't end up in your wallet? Or you sending money to a wallet associated with crime?
You might argue, fine, but at least you can prove the transaction was for legit purposes.  Can you? Can you remember the fish food you bought 18 months ago from an OpenBazaar seller? Do you want the authorities investigating you out of the blue, demanding an explanation for a trivial purchase you can't remember and the stress that brings?

I'm sure in time OB will become a fully featured trading platform to compete with OpenCart, Magento, shopify.
Once that happens, a lot of established business will start using it. Things like VAT calculation, and reports are essential for high volume traders.  Integration into accounts software, also a must.

Circle is shaping up to be a credible competitor to PayPal. But it needs some serious momentum behind it to make any dent into PayPals business.
Facebooks payment platform has the reach, but not the innovation. Circle and Facebook could be a good match for each other.

I wish the British public would wake up and take an interest in what this is about. Most people just shrug their shoulders, and declare they have nothing to hide.  If this bill before parliament becomes law, watch other governments around the world follow suit.
The worst part of this bill, is "equipment interference". The man on the street has no clue what this means.

You don't charge tax for overseas buyers, so I don't see how that makes any difference. That's why OB needs to handle sales tax correctly.
All the major selling platforms do. It's essential, particularly in the EU, where tax registered buyers can avoid the tax too, providing they give the correct credentials. The software needs to verify that the buyer is entitled.

Great list. The one thing that worries me about companies advertising VPN services, is that it could be run by a government, and you wouldn't know.

Looking at the bigger picture, they could go head to head with PayPal, and incorporate a payment system into WhatsApp. If they bought Circle, they could merge in their app.

The UK government is playing a different tactic, but basically trying the same thing.
When they proposed this, they were forced to retract it. Instead, they did a complete U-turn, and are now saying how wonderful encryption is.
What they are now trying to make law, is "equipment interference". Every company manufacturing hardware &amp; software connected to the internet, needs to register the product with the government. They then may be asked to "interfere" with it, under a gagging order.
I bet ARM will get a knock on the door.

There are loads of tutorials out there, on the web and YouTube.
Docker runs your apps in a container. Containers can be built from script files, or from a bash shell from within that container, based on your favorite distro.
So for example, your script might use debian as a base platform, then apt-get any dependencies, including git. Then pull docker from git. And execute.
The container can then be uploaded to docker hub, for others to download as a complete running container.
Containers come with built in security.

I don't hold out much hope. MPs don't get it. "If you have nothing to hide....."
The "equipment interference" part of the bill, which as far as I'm concerned the worst part of the bill, is not being scrutinised. And not enough UK companies are objecting.

Richard Branson invested in TranferWise. So it's sad to hear, that they are dismissing bitcoin, given Bransons positive views.

Yet a bill going through UK parliament wants to impose a system where all I.T. products and services that contain any comms (almost everything these days) have to be registered with the government first, and if required, back doors implemented, under a gagging order.

Well yeah, but that's unlikely to happen overnight, but once they see the threat, they will need to compete. Offering cheaper payment options to sellers can only mean bitcoin.
This is just the kind of killer app bitcoin needs to take off in a big way.

Most of the billion dollar investments made up until now have yet to show up in the market place.  Optimism for 2016 could be a factor.

Hehe. Same as if you lost your card. You need a backup, in the form of a brain wallet.

Hopefully this, coupled with NY regulation will be the tipping point.
But I can't see the UK consumers getting excited over bitcoin, except maybe the youth market. Maybe I'm wrong. If retailers give discounts, then it might make it attractive. Chip n pin, is the norm for so many people.

It's surprising how many Christians haven't read the bible.
Before the printing press, only the   priests, and people in power had access to the bible, and they tried very hard to stop it becoming widely available.
But even today, Christians, indoctrinated from birth, have not read all the bible in context. They have been so brainwashed with the nice bits, they don't know much about the bad bits.
Thankfully education, and the internet, is stripping religion of its power. Europe are ahead. America are a few generations behind, but they will catch up. Unbiased, scientific education is key.

Lower fees is not enough to tempt people away from ebay. The larger number of eyeballs looking at your ebay auction, compensate.

Yes I know, but next time their bank manager drops in, TransferWise may be more inclined to mention it if they have evidence that they are losing custom.  It looks anti-competitive
@_date: 2014-01-02 02:45:24
Transferwise is really good. They credit you money if they can transfer cheaper then they quote, and often do.  PM me if you want your first transfer free, and I'll send you a code :-)

This is a good idea. As a small business owner, I do my own bookkeeping, and it's a real drag. I have to put all my purchase invoices into the accounts program, and then match it with the bank account entry. Or, I have a payment on my bank statement, and I have to figure out what it's for, and find an invoice.
Wouldn't it be fantastic if all payments, had a matching bill of sale, which can be pulled on demand by my accounts system. Bookkeeping world be so less time consuming.
@_date: 2014-04-26 03:19:26
Jeeez even receiving bank transfers are not safe now.
If you make a mistake, you make your apologies, and ask the recipient to send you it back. If they don't, you make a small claims, get a lawyer or write it off as bad luck. If the bank can help meditate, then fine, but they should not have any powers to enforce.

Having just got back from traveling, where I had to deal with two different foreign currencies, and where credit cards were not always accepted, bitcoin, universally accepted, would have made a big difference.

Piratebay doesn't host the files, you need client software to run the p2p element.
In the same way, OpenBazaar requires client software to host the goods for sale, and process the transactions.
It's quite likely a web site will pop up that allows you to search, and view goods for sale, in much the same way PirateBay does for torrents. But you must use client software to make the trade.
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:51:26
How do you know?
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:30:55


Not really. Spending it is a problem. But the biggest threat, is you. Humans make mistakes. With a hardware wallet, you never come into contact with the private key, so less risk.

Because if bitcoin is to become used by the local people, then exchange rates will have to be competitive. It's in the retailers interest for shoppers to use bitcoin, instead of credit cards, and in many cases cash.
Retailers have no influence over exchange rates to foreigners, where credit cards are used (and cash for that matter), so by offering bitcoin, they can not only save themselves credit card charges, but potentially offer much better rates to shoppers from overseas. Win win.
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:22:14
The problem is getting a BitPay account. I applied for one and I was expecting it to take a couple of days. Two weeks later, I was approved, but only for a maximum of $100.
You then have to go through another process, to get the limit increased. I waited, and waited, and then applied for a BIPS account, which was approved in hours.  Over 3 months later, I still haven't heard back from BitPay. Not that I care now.
@_date: 2014-06-10 22:25:08
On a fixed fee like that, it's relative of course.

Agreed. Decentralisation works when there are enough nodes to support the network. For a single purpose node, the temptation would be too run the node, only when needed, which for git could be minimal, especially for mobile users.
There has to be an incentive to keep a node running 24/7. Either a financial incentive, or because the node is is essential for multiple services you rely on.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:44:48
Yep, that's the sort of thing. Once we get client user interfaces that match ebays ease of use, then ebay will have to drop prices, and eventually go extinct with a bit of luck.

Isn't he asking for a level playing field, and regulation where fiat and taxation is involved?
Without governments giving clear directives, then accountants, banks, and official government departments, have nothing to go on, and make it up, or ignore it, which helps nobody. For example, the UK government seems to be pro-bitcoin, and tax department have made clear rulings it. But you can't pay your taxes in bitcoin, and UK banks are blocking bitcoin, because there us nothing to say they can't. So it's all disjointed at the moment.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:37:44

The Trezor never gives up it's private key, so in theory, it's as safe as a paper wallet, without the hassle.
If you take into account other factors, such as the human element in making mistakes, and that paper wallets need to be put on a computer when you spend it. It's probably, a lot safer.

How long will it take to adapt though?
First you need to modify the code. You can borrow code from other coins, but you need to be sure the new codebase is secure. Then you somehow need to insure everybody updates. Not something you can do without a fair bit I'd notice.
We need to concentrate on getting more users on p2pool. And develop competing p2pool technologies. And make it super easy to use (building it into miner software for example).

You can run your own node, or use someone else's. It really doesn't matter. The problem is trust. It's possible the node could be dishonest. But you could say that of any pool, and the beauty of p2pool, is you can run your own, and know your not being ripped off.

Transferwise used to be the place to get money into the exchanges from UK bank accounts. The UK banks leant on them last year to put a stop to it.
They are all in cahoots with each other. We know this from the endless corruption we keep seeing.

Only this assumes the malicious code will operate immediately, and not delayed or only when the wallet has enough funds.
A smart developer would not want you to know it was their software that is responsible, otherwise it might raise an alarm, before the software has had a chance to get installed as much as possible.
Use  a Trezor.

Bitcoin is at a critical point at the moment. It promised ultra low fees, decentralization, and fast money transfers, which were true to begin with, but today it's not. It's success has caused issues. Yet it still has the highest market cap of all the cryptocurrencies.
Diversify is my best advice. Nobody knows what will happen.

It matters that Bitcoin seems to be losing innovation to markets which should have been low hanging fruit.

Users pay to secure data on the blockchain.
The more use it gets, the more tokens are burnt, putting pressure on supply. This forces up the price. Conservative projections put the value between $13 and $400. Today it's just hit a new high of $3.90.
Bill Gates gave the Factom Foundation a sack full of cash last year to build a system to secure medical documents. Other high profile VCs have invested. And today Overstock.

Not at all. At the moment most of the mining is done inside China's great firewall. There is no solution on the table to decentralise.
Given miners have all the voting power, it's unlikely they would ever vote for this to change.
@_date: 2017-02-17 19:11:33

The UK is closed for business, when it comes to Bitcoin.  The banks are in control, and are corrupt. Understandably, they don't want bitcoin.
You can't get a new bank account if you are seen to be trading in bitcoin in any way. Some existing businesses have been lent on by the banks, such as TransferWise, who had to stop transferring money to and from bitcoin exchanges.
HMRC had to make their stance known, so that accountants could do their job. But this is not the green light to start up new bitcoin business.

@_date: 2017-02-10 00:10:45

@_date: 2017-02-08 10:53:30
That's out of date. The M2 release that went live a few weeks ago does Ethereum. It was announced on one of the chat rooms. Can't find it right now (on mobile), but if you Google "Factom Ethereum", you will see news articles from last year about their intention.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:17:43
It's quite simple.
Mining is a business, with rent, bills, and capital investment. It's fearlessly competitive, resulting in it moving to the most cost effective place on earth.
So its natural, miners are going to defend their investment. They are not to blame for this. It's just the consequence of how bitcoin has evolved.
So what is gained by getting around the table, and reasoning with them? It's just not going to happen.

It scares me that all that hashing power is behind a communist state firewall.
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:41:38
I agree the LN will be Bitcoins killer app. But I'm doubting it will go live anytime soon.  Ethereum's LN goes live next month, and manufactures of IoT are looking to use it for micropayments.
I fear Bitcoin is not only losing out on that, but also the lucrative blockchain data security market. Factom seems to have that covered, with investments from Bill Gates and Overstock.com. It's going to be used for securing medical records, insurance, and government.
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:35:50
That would have been good advice in the run up to today. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 23:33:49
Data security.
Not every country in the world needs or is ready for payment type services.
But every country, every government, every business, financial services, medical and so on, need their data secured.
Factom uses the Bitcoin blockchain to secure data. Overstock.com invested in Factom last week. Bill Gates gave the Factom Foundation cash to create a solution to secure medical records.
It's going to be big, and not everyone knows they need it yet. But when they see it can combat corruption, make documents stand up as evidence in court, they will beg for it.
@_date: 2017-02-18 04:11:57

I know, but what use are nodes if the great firewall gets disconnected?
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:46:28
It doesn't need to be a miners that disrupts bitcoin. Most of the hashing power is run from inside a firewall, operated by a communist state.
Should the firewall fail, deliberately or otherwise, Bitcoin will fork, leaving the chain outside of China venerable.
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:19:15
Yeah, TransferWise is brilliant. I used to use them all the time for Bitstamp until someone lent on them and put a stop on it.
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:54:05
It's not China's fault. It's just the way bitcoin has evolved. If too much power falls into the hands of one state, then that states actions will effect everybody.

Agreed, but Ethereums LN goes live next month. Bitcoin is likey to lose the IoT market, and could make entry into areas previously dominated by bitcoin.
Overstock just invested in Factom. They were traditionally behind bitcoin. Bitcoin should have taken on the security market.
Bit by bit, Bitcoin will lose out, for as long as it can't evolve.
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:11:26
That use is that to paypal, google and apple?  "We can scale, but only when the miners say so".
Or they can go to an alt-coin and they will say, "yes we can scale on this date".
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:33:53
And yet Bitcoin can't scale, and it's entire value is secured behind a communist state firewall.
I think your dreaming. That could have happened, but it's too late. Business can't invest in a network where miners can dictate the outcome of important decisions. Bitcoins voting mechanism is broken.
We are already seeing platforms like Factom making headway into the corporate sector. Overstock, previously big in bitcoin,  just announced they are backing Factom. Bill Gates, and others also backing Factom for securing medical records. That should have gone to Bitcoin.
Ethereim looks to be getting a big chunk of IoT market. Also visa-scale micropayments next month. Plus too many other things to mention.
The writing was on the wall when Circle quit.
Let's hope Bitcoin gets ETF next month.
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:05:18


It promised to deliver a Turing Complete smart contracts network. It promised you can build dapps.
It delivered on both of those, and a lot more.
Everything is "next month, next month" and investors realized it is a dead protocol.
Examples of where that has happened? The LN (Raiden) has been in beta over 6 months. The official release is next month. Do you think that is an empty promise?
By contrast, Bitcoin has promised the LN for years, and it still doesn't work.
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:17:14
Yep, that's what the Trezor should have been.
Hope it's not expensive.

The halving doesn't matter, so long as the bitcoin price goes up to compensate. Can you guarantee that?
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:55:42
Looks good though. Privacy built in as well.
@_date: 2017-02-10 03:42:54
Next month.
@_date: 2016-03-26 03:13:38
Yes, and it won't be long before someone writes an Apache/Nginx plugin, to allow business to host their own OB shop, directly from there web site, without the users having to run a client.
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:20:51
Might have gone back to $200 by then. If it goes below $700 miners start losing money, and go out of business. Diversify.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:59:06
That may be true, but they will have to act quickly, otherwise other coins will do the same job, just as well.  The Raiden Network goes live next month.
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:00:28
I asked OP about micropayments. He said wait for LN. I asked if it would be out before Raiden.
Now your asking about scaling?
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:08:38
Correct, but how do we do that? Mining will naturally go where electricity is cheap. The algorithm needs to change, but it's too late for that. China already has that monopoly.
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:30:08
I remember when adding a fee was considered a tip, and entirely optional.  Now it's cheaper to use my bank in many cases.
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:33:45
As others have said, get a hardware wallet. It's also a good idea to diversify to spread risk.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:50:25


Correct BU also works for LN. Miners didn't have an inventive for that either.
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:34:43
Diversify. Spread the risk. If you had bought into GNT a few months ago, it would be worth 300% more now.
@_date: 2017-02-10 03:11:14
Almost everything mined, goes through the Chinese exchanges, to pay for electricity, rent, and hardware.
That's most of the bitcoin economy right there.
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:05:09
Then you should know better than securing all your data in a communist state. I have spent time in China. The internet is horrendous. I couldn't even get a connection to my servers in London, without packet loss.
What potential? Other coins can transfer value faster and cheaper than Bitcoin. Other coins are less centralised. Bitcoin can't scale, yet next month Ethereum will have visa-scale low cost transfers, and micropayments, that Bitcoin can only dream of.  Bitcoin is unlikely to get a LN, which is the single most important thing to growth.
As someone that used to CPU mine Bitcoin in the early days, it is upsetting to me that Bitcoin has not evolved as it should have done.
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:13:31


Now, let me see. Here are a few to get you started.


I can see your a little upset by all this innovation. So I will leave it at that.
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:59:28
Humans make mistakes. Paper wallets are fine, but don't make a mistake. Ever. Not once. And did you check for malware? Are you sure? Really? Your that confident?
Hardware wallets never give up your private key. Not even to you. Malware?...who cares.
@_date: 2017-02-12 23:48:44
It's not just scaling that needs to be addressed, but centralised mining. Scaling may bring back those merchants who have either given up on Bitcoin, or are sitting on the fence. But it won't bring in big business, like Paypal, Google, Apple, Amazon, while China has such a big stranglehold.
People will just start diversifying more, into other coins, until one starts to get a lot of traction. Plenty of contenders out there, and more advanced than litecoin.
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:39:24
The nature of mining is to get the fastest ROI. So its shouldn't come as a surprise, miners will vote for what serves them best.
In the early days, it was not a problem, as users and miners were mostly the same people with the same motives.
@_date: 2017-02-10 13:31:58
What's the scam? I'm not aware of it. Link?
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:36:51


Then why has Bitcoin not got it's LN yet? You do know that's the big catalyst for growth. Bitcoin will do all the things, like visa-scale transactions, and micropayments, once it gets that. Except it wont be the first, and will miss the boat.
Don't know what that is but I can't imagine Bitcoin going to be toast for any reason other than a major flaw in SHA256. 
Most of Bitcoins mining power is behind a government firewall. If that is disconnected from the rest of the world, then Bitcoin will fail. Exchanges will have to suspend deposits and withdraws. The price will tank.
@_date: 2017-02-10 13:29:02
What on earth are you talking about? Bitcoin is secured by China. A communist state.
Ethereum is far more decentralised.
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:08:30
Your Trezor is fine. SatoshiLabs made an error of judgment, which has hurt their reputation, not the security. It's still the safest way to store your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:56:22
I didn't see the mechanism here where security relates to fees.
If that were true, fees would be much lower today, as the network is fundamentally less secure than it was in the past.
@_date: 2017-02-13 02:14:28
The longer it takes to solve this issue, the more people are going to diverse their investments into alts.
You might say diversifying is not such a bad thing, to reduce risk, but if one of those coins starts to make any serious headway, or get backing from a big company, it could be disastrous for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:44:36
I'm not so sure. Wouldn't the ETF want to declare a decision quickly, to avoid it leaking?
My thinking is they are reluctant to go ahead by leaving it so close to the wire. 
Today's events can only hurt those chances.
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:29:57
Too late. Overstock.com announced today they have invested in an altcoin.
They used to be very pro-bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:01:07
Bitcoin's inability to scale is hurting it. Seen todays news from Overstock.com? They just invested in an alt-coin.
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:57:57
Lol, so sometime came up with an app, which just so happened to be targeted for the ETH network. It got a load of unexpected attention. It had a bug in it, which got hacked and so Ethereum and Factom are a scam.
It's a bit like having a virus, written by a hacker for Windows, and Microsoft installed a fix, to kill it, and saying Microsoft and Apple are a scam.
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:48:33
No, but it's losing out to other coins, because it's unable to evolve.
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:03:40
ASIC resistant POW maybe? Or perhaps POW itself is a problem.
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:56:27
What happened to the promise of micropayments that cryptocurrencies were going to solve?
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:45:23
Money laundering service. Freshens up your coins.
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:34:38
It is a pity the government/central bank which is apparently pro-bitcoin, won't step in and do something. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:29:35
That's a shame. Bitcoin looked very promising.
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:50:42
If the internet was disconnected at the Great Firewall, China would carry on as normal. Outside of China, there would be a new fork. Exchanges would have to suspend deposits and withdraws. Any trades on the minor chain, would get wiped out, the moment if/when the connection is restored. Panic would cause a collapse in price.
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:09:49
It looks like Ethereum have the right idea. Switch to POS before mining becomes centralised.  Their plan is to allow everyone with a little eth a vote.
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:13:49


But it wasn't wrong as, as you go on to say. I never said Bitcoin would do micropayments out of the box, although I remember the days when a transaction fee was considered a tip, and optional.
Given how long bitcoin has been around, you would think this would have been resolved by now. Ethereum gets visa-scale micro payments next month. So it looks like Bitcoin is going to lose out.
@_date: 2017-02-05 22:11:48
Yes I know about the Lightening Network. But Bitcoin hasn't got one. So the promise of low fees and micropayments has been lost. Other coins satisfy this just fine.
What we have learnt, is POW is good at bootstrapping a coin, but at a certain point, it becomes detrimental. Centralisation occurs. 
Of what use is all that POW, when it's all behind a firewall of a communist state? Another Tiananmen Square event is not inconceivable. Nor is Trump upsetting the Chinese government. Neither of which is an attack on Bitcoin, but would likely kill it.
If your happy to have your wealth, secured that way, good luck to you. But telling people how Bitcoin needs to cost so much, because it's secure, is either delusional, or dishonest.
@_date: 2017-02-10 12:32:09
Ethereum. It's getting a lot of interest for the IoT market.
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:29:06
It sounds a bit like Ethereums Casper.  A stake is required on a node, which gets eaten away for being a bad actor.  It restores decentralised voting back to the users, who can run nodes cheaply (like a raspberry pi), and earn interest on their stake.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:49:09


Do you think miners want off chain tech?
@_date: 2017-02-13 00:29:06
The fist time Bitcoin went to over $1000, it quickly dropped to $250 and stayed there for quite some time.
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:25:30
Diversify. Spread the risk.
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:53:55
No, because of the inflated exchange rates they charge.
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:02:05
Your not using your Trezor anymore, just because Satoshilabs made an error of judgment? It's still a good product. No reason not to use it.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:52:59


And lower fees!


Then you didn't understand what LN will do when that goes live.
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:14:39
They anchor to Ethereum now.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:45:29
Do you run a mining farm?
What incentive do miners have to enable it?
@_date: 2017-02-10 20:26:02
Ethereum's LN goes live next month.
If all of China's miners are behind a government firewall, then if that firewall goes down, all the the mining power goes offline in an instant. It will cause an immediate fork.
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:20:11
We have a winner!
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:32:04
The City is a scam. The whole banking system is corrupt. Do they want bitcoin? Hell no.
All the more reason to be surprised, the chancellor is taking an interest.
Now it's true, when a politician wants to bury something, they often start making lots of noise about it, to make you think it's important and on the engender. Instead it's just talk, with zero action.  But in this instance, I'm not so sure. It seems too significant.
I guess we will have to wait and see.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:31:46
Yes. Lower fees.
But it's not just that. Anything that may rock the boat, poses a risk. Business hates risk that it can't control.
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:16:13
Presumably It will take a while for people to deposit money into the exchange before we see any real activity.
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:34:34
How would you get the miners to agree to a change? Seems like a catch 22 situation.
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:07:28
Miners will be miners. You can't just reason with them. They have ROIs to worry about. What do power companies using mining equipment to dissipate excess energy care about segwit, lightning networks, and lower fees?
The problem is POW has caused users voting power to shift to China. And it's too late to fix it.
@_date: 2014-10-30 01:10:43
Nice, but if much prefer a hardware wallet.

I guess we will have to wait and see if Ethereum POS works.
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:43:24
Unlikely given the state of the community. What business can trust in a network, with so much division?
Circle lost faith. Now Overstock.com is investing in Factom. Ethereum is getting micropayments next month, and IoT manufacturers are interested.
This should have been bitcoins territory.
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:02:14
Yeah I have since been doing a lot of reading. Seems it will not work without segwit or a hard fork. Given nobody knows when that will happen, it's not an option. :(

Nobody knows what is going to happen. Diversify. Come back when the dust has settled.

@_date: 2017-02-05 22:52:12
Oh, so all good then. Bitcoin has lots of cheap and fast ways to send funds. No other coins can scale better than Bitcoin.  POW is the only workable option, and Bitcoins implementation is good. State operated firewalls are nothing to worry about.
Thank you, you have enlightened me. I don't know what all the other people are fussing about.
@_date: 2017-02-10 13:17:48
Bitcoin has failed to do micropayments, required amongst other things IoT. There is only one coin that can do it. Next month. Ethereum.
Prediction markets will go live this summer. Requires a LN. Bitcoin hasn't got one. Will it have one by the summer? I doubt it. Ethereum again.
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:30:06
Do you know when this roadmap will be complete? There seems to be confusion when, and in which way bitcoin will evolve, and in how secure it is.
Raiden will be out in a few months. I'm wondering what impact this will have if it goes live before Bitcoins solution.
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:55:17

Nope. That was just from $12 to $20. Prior to that it was a ten fold increase, because Ethereum delivered on a promise. And the big promises are still to come.


It's an infrastructure project. A bit like when the railroads were built. You buy shares for the future. It's going to be a good year. And next year, explosive. The only thing Bitcoin can hope for is the ETF. If that fails, what is it good for?
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:17:48
You keep mentioning the price.
Ethereum went from under $1 to an ATH of $20 in 6 months, last year.
I don't get why you think Bitcoins  market is more desirable. We all know China sets the price.
Had you invested in Ethereums GNT 3 months ago, you would be up 300% now.  Bitcoin didn't get that growth.
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:07:07
That's fine, providing "we the people" can indeed unite. The community is divided at last 3 ways as it is.
The other problem is - when.
It would take time to organise this, and already bitcoin is loosing out on markets which should have been low hanging fruit.
Ethereum will have its LN next month. It's attracting interest in the massive IoT market.
Data security is going to Factom. Overstock.com announced their investment this week. Bill Gates is using it to secure medical records.

That's just wishful thinking, and narrow mindedness.
The blocksize issue needs fixing yesterday. No business is going to invest heavily in Bitcoin as an infrastructure, while there is so much uncertainty. They are all investing in the likes of Ethereum and Factom.

@_date: 2016-01-26 17:15:35
As much as that. Defiantly an incentive then. I wonder how low uber could go, to fend off competition.  They would argue, they vet drivers, and provide insurance. But other companies could provide that service to drivers for a fee, and offer certification.

Agreed. It's something I have been thinking about, for another industry, yet to be untapped.
It's a bit different, in that it's important the provider has a minimum standard of qualification. I think the money to be made, is in setting up an organisation that can certify, and insure its members, to give customer confidence. Somebody to turn to if something goes wrong.

Part of this Bill to be introduced to parliament, is "Equipment Interference".  They want hardware manufactures to implement back doors by law. Don't think this is just a UK thing. Other governments will be lining up for this, if it gets through.
They are selling this as a solution to terrorism, protecting our kids online, and finding missing persons.
Unfortunately, the "If you have nothing to hide, why would you object?" argument is a powerful one, to those that have no clue about technology.  This is the line MP's are using, and they need to be educated how dangerous this is.

Factom is a good case in point, and hit the news last week. 
It's not about moving money, but about data security. And it uses bitcoin blockchain to underpin it. But it is also a coin in it's own right, with value, and a wallet (Jaxx and Exodus soon).
Overstock.com announced a big investment in it last week.
Bill Gates also gave the Factom Foundation money to develop a solution to secure medical records.
The uses are massive. Every business on the planet need this, and they don't even know it yet.

@_date: 2017-02-05 18:23:43


Nonsense. Micropayments were always touted as possible with Bitcoin.
In fact, it is impossible that fees remain low forever, because bitcoin is run by thousands of miners on expensive equipment
Firstly, economies of scale should kick in, to provide lower fees but haven't due to centralisation.
Secondly, innovation, such as the Lightning Network as you pointed out contradict your statement. Low fees are possible.
Thirdly, the cost of the equipment is due to Bitcoins POW. Once POS or some other system is proven to work, Bitcoin could theoretically change to it. However, it never will, because the miners would be cutting their own income stream.
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:42:55
As someone that's looking to invest in a platform that can provide me with micropayments, "Nobody knows" is very worrying. Whilst I'm quite small, I can't see the likes of Paypal, Google, and Facebook using a platform with so much uncertainty surrounding it.
Raiden seemes to have a very solid roadmap, and non of the centralisation and therefore security issues Bitcoin has.
@_date: 2016-01-26 11:29:41
If it were dramatically cheaper, then yes, that's an incentive. One of the reasons people use uber in the first place.
I wonder if the price could be cut enough, to satisfy both driver, and customer. It probably would need to be enough for them both to want to try an alternative system. And uber could respond with cheaper prices, to disincentivise.
There is a safety in what your already used to. So ubers momentum will be hard to overcome.

It's not up to the developers/core foundation.  All they can do, is advise. There needs to be a consensus among miners.
This is why it's ok. Miners are not going to accept it, if it's not for the good of the community. And likewise, the foundation, can't be forced/blackmailed into doing this, every time something bad happens.
In this particular case, I can't see any reason not to do this, given it has zero impact on anything other than a reversing the effects of a failed experiment.

That's worse IMO.  Unless you can realistically pay it back in a reasonable time, it's not really a loan at all. It's a gamble on his good will.
Unless your father is very wealthy, and it's a drop in the ocean, I'd say your taking a risk with his money. If it were to backfire, you could end up in a horrible situation you will most likely regret. Stress can have adverse health effects, which you might not appreciate at 17.

The voting mechanism is broken. In the early days, miners and users were mostly the same people, with the same motive.
Now that they are not, miners are always going to want higher fees, and users will always want low fees, and innovation.

So what can we do?
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:32:13

What we have learnt, is POW is successful at bootstrapping a cryptocurrency. But as we are seeing, it can lead to an inability to evolve. Maybe that's because it's not (in bitcoins case) ASIC resistant, or maybe POW is the wrong tool for the job, once a coin gets popular.
Other coins will continue to evolve, and have their own growing pains, but the one that finds the solution to securing the voting rights of everybody, won't ever be in the situation bitcoin finds itself in.

I didn't think what happens with Litecoin will have any impact. It's not the technology that's the problem. It's the motive.

I doubt all those Chinese power companies running mining equipment to dissipate energy, read reddit. I also doubt they care about segwit, blocksizes, lower fees, or lightning networks.

Sure the coins value is manipulated, in the same way Bitcoin was, and to some extent still is.
But look at the fundamentals, and Eth particularly looks good.  Investment in the platform, is higher than any other crypto, alongside Factom.
Bitcoin can only do one thing - a store of value. And even that is starting to look out of shape, which can only get worse.
@_date: 2016-12-04 03:25:49
Oh really? Why is Bitcoin chasing these features then? You don't think the Lightening Network is worth having? Visa scale transactions. Ethereum already has it's implementation in testing, and will go live at some point. Bitcoins lightening network may never happen.
True anonymity? Alts already do this. Dapps? Bitcoin's answer to that is Rootstock. Worth having? I'd say so, but not going to happen, unless the scaling issue is sorted.
Bitcoin can't wait 1 year to fix it's scaling.

@_date: 2016-12-01 05:36:12
Agreed, but the miners then were a different bunch of people, with different priorities. It's less about speculation, and more about turning around a thin profit, where collecting transaction fees make a difference.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:11:01
Don't forget, higher prices, don't necessary mean more mining profits. The difficulty rises to match it. Margins get squeezed, to match the price.
So any short-term gains are just that. And of course the reverse can happen, which is worse, because you might not be able to pay the electricity bills.
Miners don't like price volatility. Up, yes, but gradual and sustained.

@_date: 2016-12-08 21:49:01
I don't really know what your trying to get at. The original question was why a miner might not want to enable Segwit.
The presumption being, it will be good for the price in the long run.
I'm saying, miners don't hold. They operate on margins, which require most of their mining income, converted to fiat to pay the bills.
What's left over, is their income. They may hold that of course, but that's no different from you or I holding some of our paycheck in Bitcoin to speculate.
Keeping the mining business profitable comes first. And Segwit kills their transaction fees.

The voting mechanism is broken.

No they don't. The difficulty goes up to compensate.
Margins are very tight, which means you have to operate on a tight cost/reward rato.
Sure, sharp rises means extra profit. But sharp drops can put you out of business.
Professional miners like stability, with slow growth. All the more reason not to rock the boat.

It's the system that's wrong. The incentives worked nicely when we all used to CPU mine on our desktops. Miners and users were the same people. A democracy.
That's no longer the case, as miners have split away from the users, with their own motives, and pressures.
Maybe we are learning POW is not sustainable? Or it needs modifying somehow.
@_date: 2017-01-30 20:18:23
In the early days, users and miners were mostly the same people, and shared the same motives.
Today, mining is mostly all done in China, due to their low power costs, low rent, and hardware availability.
This has caused an imbalance in voting, where only the motives of miners count, and not that of users. Users want low fees, fast transaction times, and innovation. Miners want high fees which is the result of lack of innovation.
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:58:05
You have to pay your monthly costs, which are quite significant.
Electricity, rent, hardware.
So you have to cash in your bitcoins every month to pay the bills. What's left is your profit. If you hold, then it's no different from you or I buying bitcoin with our paycheck. Your holding to speculate.

You think Bitcoin is less of a risk? It has serious scaling issues right now, and Segwit is unlikely to happen. Maybe Bitcoin will get through this, maybe it won't. The point is, it's a risk.

It's a very simplistic example.
You could set up a betting system, where any number of people could pay into a contract, and it will automatically pay out to the winner(s), when the result is published on a trusted news site. No middle man required.
You could give money to your kids, which are programmed to only work in predefined stores, and message you when it was spent, and on what.

It's amazing, because we are on the cusp of a new computing revelation, using p2p and blockchain technologies, and if this law comes into force, the UK will be a technology backwater.  OpenBazaar for example, won't work, which will bring a whole new way to do commerce.

Who cares, all stepping stones lead to the end goal eventually.
What is great about this, is that you can spend your bitcoins anywhere, which will help adoption.  Once retailers understand how it works, then it won't be long before they start enquiring how to save on transaction fees.
Once the POS terminal manufactures see what's happening, maybe they too will assist.

Any purchase, is a contract. I'll give you bitcoin, in exchange for coffee.

Your not seeing the bigger picture here.
Others have tried to compete with ebay, and failed, because you need critical mass. And that can take time, which a startup with bills to pay doesn't have. It also needs a huge marketing budget, and an incentive to switch.
OB doesn't have bills to pay. Even if the backers go away, OB won't.
It's free to list your stuff. Existing eBay and Alibaba sellers have nothing to lose by uploading their wares. Once uploaded, they stay there, and is searchable.
OB doesn't need a marketing budget. It will spread by word of mouth. The media will soon pick it up (for the wrong reasons probably, but that's ok).
Private sellers will love it. Quite often stuff is just not worth listing on ebay. OB is like your own shop, without the cost or hassle of your own web site.

@_date: 2017-04-07 14:28:06
Your right.
In the early days, users and miners were the same people, with the same motives. Today, that is no longer the case, and mining is a business, with all the normal market forces.
You can't blame the miners, for being miners. It's their job to squeeze every drop of power from their machines, and be competitive.
The problem, is what few people want to acknowledge. Bitcoins implementation of POW.

If they pull this off, and it works as intended, it won't be long before it hits headline news. Admittedly for all the wrong reasons, but as people try it, I think it will catch on, and be a driver for bitcoin adoption.
Think of all the thousands of business that advertise on Alibaba. Putting there goods on OpenBazaar will cost them nothing.

You see, it doesn't matter if your computer has malware on it. When you spend money, the hardware wallet signs the payment. Not the untrustworthy PC. The HW wallet, never gives up your private key. Not even to you (except the backup seed obviously, on initializing).
Also, humans make mistakes. The chances of making a mistake on a HW wallet, is slim. Paper wallets, are far less forgiving.

The article is an easy read, but I'll try.  In the old days, we used to have a single receive address for our wallets. The downside, was anyone could peek into your wallet, and see how rich you are, and also reveal which hookers and drug dealers you use.
These days, we use throwaway receive address. But that requires you to generate a new one each time. Not very good for printing on your business cards.
Now we will be able to generate an address that can be used by anyone, that can't be traced beyond that of a transaction between two people.
@_date: 2016-10-23 02:18:50
You might be missing the point. The private key is generated on the HW wallet itself. It never gives it up, even to it's owner. You get a backup seed, you write down by hand, in case the HW wallet is lost/damaged.
Unless you take great care, without making a single mistake, a paper wallet, is vulnerable to having the key leaked. Even after 10 years of safe keeping, it could be all gone when you spend it.
A hardware wallet is almost foolproof, from our human folly.

Net neutrality is good where bandwidth is not limited by technical restrictions (providing it allows for emergency or opt-in packet shaping).

I don't doubt KNC have behaved poorly. But I'm afraid on the matter of whether your a business or not - technically you are.  And two courts that I know of agree.

In the UK you can buy your broadband from your local supermarket chain for a cheap service or from lots of independent ISPs with a choice of services and SLAs. Yet it goes down the same cable to your house. Net neutrality is not an issue.

There is no UK exchange, because no bank will let you open an account for that purpose.
HRMC already have rules about alternative methods of payment. Bartering for example is legal, but you must pay the equivalent tax in sterling.

Not quite what your asking, but Dr. Christos Vlachos, the Nicosia University Chief Financial Officer  is partitioning the Cyprus government to become a world leader for Bitcoin.

It's a vending machine! There should be enough profit to cover the occasional fraudulent transaction.

I use KashFlow, the online accounts system. I asked them a while ago about Bitcoin. They added BTC as a currency for me, but it only works to 2 decimal places, like all the other currencies, so not so good.
For it to work properly, they need multi currency bank account support to. It's one of the most frequently requested features, yet no sign they will deliver.

What can we do to help the Cyprus government to decide to embrace bitcoin? This would be good given they are on the EU.

Something like this?

Yeah there are loads of ISPs that don't filler anything. If you choose one of the cheap mass market ISPs like Sky, BT, Talk Talk, Virgin, PlusNet then you can expect filtering.
It's a BS story anyway.

Can't remember if I had 2FA on at that time. I have a Yubikey. I only installed the Android app to try it out, back in May I think, when it was first launched.
Wish the Trezor would hurry up and ship.

Suggestion: If this uses anything like TOR, where data passes through private nodes, or if cpu cycles are required, let there be an optional tiny charge, to reward people that set up fast nodes. Nodes with the best ping/data throughput get rewarded more.

I was going to ask why an acceptable minimum fee can't be just calculated on the fly. But of course your wallet has no concept of worth. It needs an authority (in this case the devs) to make adjustments.
There has to be a better solution, perhaps based on the average of multiple references prices.
EDIT: looks like the devs are already working on a better solution.

Can't understand why more don't use p2pool. It can be a bit complex to set your own node up, but you can always use someone else's, and most of them have 0% fee.

Try Black Arrow. They have new miners coming out March.

What about Linux on the desktop? Highly configurable. If I need to use Windows, I just run it in virtualbox.
I have never liked Apple's closed mentality. The only Apple product I ever bought was an ipad, and that's only because at the time, it was the only tablet worth having.

A p2pool setup requires bitcoind running, so in effect it is a full node.

Agreed, I would never touch Java, after Oracle got hold of it. Oracle have no need for Java, other than to keep their lawyers busy.
Java fanboys used to say it's rival C# was unsafe, for the very reason Java is now unsafe, yet it was FUD. Mono is lightyears ahead, and about as open as it gets.
