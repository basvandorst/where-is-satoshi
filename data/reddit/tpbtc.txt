Large companies have tedious work they want done.  Survey information(Marketing), mundane tasks(usually SEO related), or just data mining personal info for spam and junkmail purposes(aka fill this out to win a iPad!!!).  But these large companies have more important things to do with their time.
So they pay smaller companies who specialize in providing tasks to internet users, and getting the work completed.
Every time an internet user does one of these tasks for the smaller company, it is submitted.  The larger company pays the smaller company a certain amount of money for getting the task(s) completed, then the smaller company pays the internet user an even smaller amount for actually doing the work.
That's how most of them function. 
If it's not task related.  Then it's usually malware or just advertising/click-thrus.

@_date: 2013-04-07 21:03:33
A confirmation is exactly that, a confirmation.  It confirms that the sending address actually has the funds that it is attempting to send.  
And yes, it does guard against double spends.  But the question you are asking could go on and on about how specific details about how coins are sent, from which addresses in your wallet, how they are chosen, how change is made, and how they are assigned priority from a wallet with multiple addresses that each have coins to cover it.  Too much to type.  Do some wiki reading about transaction, addresses, and the sort, it's not as complicated as it appears to be.

On the topic of merchants...  If there is an item that a bitcoiner wants, there are four typical ways they will buy it:
1. Buy it with fiat like a normal consumer, continue hording coins.  (**Strengthens business confidence in fiat...  Also, bitcoin is not strengthened, possibly weakend if anything**) 
2. Sell enough bitcoins so the fiat exchanged can be used to purchase the item.  (**Strengthens business confidence in fiat... Also influences the market exchange rate negatively by creating a sell**)
3. Buy it with bitcoins.  (**Helps support businesses that accept bitcoin, and shows other businesses that they should start accepting it**)
4. Buy it with bitcoins, and then spend the equivalent amount of fiat on buying bitcoins back.  (**Helps support businesses that accept bitcoin, and shows other businesses that they should start accepting it...  Also influences the market exchange rate positively by creating a buy**)
All 4 methods get you the item.  But each one is different when you consider how it will impact bitcoin.
* I urge anyone who is using method  to consider  or  With  depending on fees and discounts, you may end up spending the same amount of fiat that you would have with   But with  you are also helping bitcoin in two different areas. It's quite literally a win win situation for bitcoin.  Plus, your BTC balance will be the same.
* If  isn't appealing,  might work better for you(or vice versa).  The real difference between the two is fees, and the fact that some people don't ever want to see their BTC balance go down at all(speculators/hoarders).
* Reasons for using  can vary widely, but should be the most avoided option if any of the other methods are possible.

In all honesty, bitcoin is simply not big enough for something like that to be built.  At least not on a large enough scale to accommodate the issues you present for the entire public.  
As great as it would be, it simply will not happen until at least 15% of **ALL** financial transactions in the world(or a country) are being done in bitcoin.  And even at that point it would probably be built and maintained poorly in the beginning.
I'm all for bitcoin, not trying to argue against you on that.  But I am trying to be a realist.  If it actually takes off, I doubt any of us will be alive to see it rival banks on a truly large scale.

You have to remember that the general public is probably only seeing the value go up or down from a simple widget or a straight forward converter page.  I'd bet that a lot are getting their numbers from tweets as well.
Most of them are not watching something like bitcoinity, and therefore don't know the details behind increases and drops..
But ya, it was pretty interesting to watch the impact all those .02 transactions had.  They were all 50 cents a piece from each other, in rapid succession.  Someone posted an image earlier when they were all in queue.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:22:35
Because your wallet is actually made up of more than the individual address it shows you in bitcoin-qt.  
Whenever you send an amount that needs change, a new address is created in your wallet.  This new address holds it.  This new address will also impact the total amount you see in bitcoin-qt, but it will not impact the amount being held in your primary address(what you are looking at on blockchain.info)
On that note.  This mechanic is another reason it is good to make regular backups of your wallet, in order to keep track of newly created change addresses.
@_date: 2013-04-04 10:49:53
Yes.  It is absolutely guaranteed to send.  The only difference between a transaction with fees and one without fees, is how long it will take to be confirmed.
The only possible situation where it would not send, is if another transaction from the same address performed a double spend with those same coins and including fees with it the second time around.  This will make it confirm before the non-fee one, effectively making it invalid once confirmations on it are attempted(common for scammers buying things).  But if you are simply sending back and forth between yourself, there is no downside at all except for the increased confirmation time.

The rationale from the topic titles alone changes so much, it's hard not to laugh.:
"Bitcoin isn't in a bubble, the price is only gonna keep going up"    
"Why the recent drop in value is a good thing for Bitcoin"    
"Ok we've finally stabilized, now it's time for Bitcoin to take hold"    
"Why we haven't actually stabilized yet"    
"It's starting to rise again, better buy now!"    
"Hold off on buying, prices are too unpredictable right now"
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:56:11


Yep.  That is the point I was trying to make.  It seems a lot of people here and on IRC think that everyone else in the world should be fine and dandy with personally maintaining their own wallets and bitcoins by themselves, alone.

The safest way to do an in person transaction is in a public place(preferably with security cameras), and to make sure that if any theft/scamming could occur, it would involve the physical item.  What I mean is:
* **Example 1**:  You meet up to buy a pair of headphones.  With your phone or laptop, setup the transaction to the point where you only need to hit send.  Before you hit send, take possession of the headphones.  Once you have them, only then do you send the transaction.  Both wait until it confirms.  Deal is done. Cool.
* **Example 2**:  You meet up to buy a pair of headphones.  With your phone or laptop, setup the transaction to the point where you only need to hit send.  Send the transaction.  Both wait until it confirms.  Once confirmed, instead of the headphones being given to you, the seller simply walks away casually.  Have fun talking to the police about stolen bitcoins.  Nobody around you saw anything more than a guy coming and going with his own headphones, and another guy playing on his phone/laptop.
* **Example 3**:  You meet up to buy a pair of headphones.  With your phone or laptop, setup the transaction to the point where you only need to hit send.  Before you hit send, take possession of the headphones.  Do not send the transaction.  Take your laptop/phone and new headphones, then make your escape in whatever fashion you feel is appropriate for the situation.  Be concerned that people around you saw you taking possession of the other person's headphones and 'escaping'.  Be concerned that he may contact the police about a physical item you stole/scammed.
In all honesty, there is no way to mitigate all risk.  But there are certainly ways to lower it significantly.  Just take those examples and swap around the item/cash/buyer/seller to whatever combination fits your situation.  Then apply whichever example method you prefer.

The buyers, obviously.  But we were/are talking about one side being a majority.  Think of 95 people wanting to sell and 5 people wanting to buy, compared to 95 people wanting to buy and 5 people wanting to sell.
Either way, there will be a 5 buyers and and 5 sellers when all is said and done, like you were trying to point out.  But the price will be radically different depending on which side is the majority.  That's what was being conveyed.

Just to play devils advocate...
Once bitcoin starts to dive, we could be seeing all that 'long lag and engine cool off' because a bunch of limit order bids are kicking it, combined with the panic of numerous at market price sellers.  
I have no idea if that is the cause, but it is certainly a possibility, regardless of how plausible.
I personally have no real answer either way, because I am not privy to MtGox's inner workings, and can only have opinions and assumptions.  Until there is no reasonable doubt left, I will continue to think this way.

You might want to take better pictures to use when presenting this idea.  You put so much time into what you wrote, but then the only product image looks pretty bad(no offense).
The picture(s) should be cropped down to the wallet itself, with better focus.  You should also include pictures of it open, pictures of it with some money and cards in it, etc etc.
If someone showed me that picture and told me nothing about it.  I would never guess that it was a wallet.  That is not a good thing.
As it stands now, I like the idea and everything that you wrote.  But the picture, not so much.

I get where you're coming from.  There are a few people/posts that believe in the positive future of of bitcoin so much, that it reaches militant/cult levels of devotion.  As someone already into bitcoin, I just shrug them off as people not understanding or willing to accept **ALL** the possibilities of bitcoin's future.
But I will agree, when I hear people speaking that way about something I am not a part of, it does kinda make it less attractive.  Or at the very least, add some skepticism to my viewpoint on it.

As long as their servers aren't compromised, your login information is not guessed/brute-forced/keylogged, and the owners do not steal your coins themselves, then it is 100% safe.
I know that sounds like I'm saying they aren't.  I'm not saying that.  I'm just pointing out all the possible risks.
For comparison sake.  The risks involved with a paper wallet are you losing whatever you wrote/engraved that private key on, and, nothing else.
The risks of using a bitcoin client on your computer are second place in the risk list, assuming it's done correctly(and the above two examples also assumed they were being done correctly).
@_date: 2013-04-04 11:52:24
Bitcoin will succeed because it's a better currency?
It is not a currency if everyone keeps buying things with fiat, and hordes/speculates their coins.  It needs to be spent to be a currency.  It needs to be spent to have a real value outside of cryptofans and speculators and tech-geeks.  The biggest hurdle to doing that is having merchants who will accept bitcoin.  That is the road that leads to validating bitcoin further as a currency.  
That is what this thread is about.  This thread is not about the best way to maximize one's personal profits through the holding of bitcoins.  That's fine, I have little issue with the percentage of people doing that.  But someone who argues that there is no incentive in option  when compared to option  is grossly incorrect as far as the future of bitcoin is is concerned.  Yes, it may benefit the specific individual, but that is not what this thread is about, or what many people believe bitcoin is about.

Perhaps you could think about formatting the text in the pop-ups better, and/or dynamically formatting the pop-up size to accommodate for the particular text inside of it?
Also...  Once clicking outside of a pop-up, I would expect it to disappear(but it does not).  That feature is particularly helpful for correcting mis-clicks in a condensed area that isn't zoomed well enough by the user(always assume a complete idiot is using your software/app/interface).

If the price of bitcoin on MtGox changed in the way that you mean, people would take notice and disregard the prices MtGox listed.  MtGox would lose reputation, other exchanges would profit.  Not a good idea for them on almost any front.
Now... If MtGox changed it ever so slightly that people didn't notice(like boiling a lobster), other exchanges would probably also trade relative to that amount, because MtGox is the most recognized rate resource..  
But that just brings about the idea that you technically cannot trust anything or anyone 100% except for yourself(any maybe your mother).  Outside of that, you try to take the path least risky, at least most of the time.

Plus, you can use it to verify that it was funded by Casacius himself(if you know the addresses he used to fund the coins he made), which helps to verify that it is real(at least as much as you can verify, without seeing the coin in person, or in a picture).
For example.  The address, '1EA8pywVqQzhd6XKQCNsfSgkP7eJ9GYyna', would have a short address of '1ea8pyw'.
Which could be searched on the blockchain with:    
TL;DR:  It's the number printed on the back of the coin.

What happens if the hard drive that the idiot proof software is installed on dies?  If the answer is that it also makes backups to a server, what happens if the server is compromised?
My point is that someone/something needs to accept the blame ABOVE the owner, and pay them back for their losses in such a scenario.  Otherwise, the idiots will revolt, and that will be the single largest blockade to widespread bitcoin adoption.

Too many people don't know about or understand change addresses.    
This needs to be changed.  Good post.
There is also a reverse example.  This huge mistake is made by many people when they have been using a client like bitcoin-qt for a while, and decide to make a paper wallet using only the primary address from bitcoin-qt.
In that case, they believe that they are putting the entire bitcoin-qt wallet balance into a paper wallet.  In fact, all they are doing is putting the balance for the PRIMARY bitcoin-qt address into the wallet.  All the change addresses hidden to the user in bitcoin-qt will not go into the paper wallet.
Then a crash occurs, or whatever.  User imports from paper wallet.  Wonders why balance is so much less than what they had.  It's because the change addresses weren't included.

What this guy said.
I think what you are really asking is if there is a way to send all your coins to somewhere that you haven't yet touched, or at least your internet connection hasn't touched.  In either case, the answer is still yes.  
You can generate a new private/public key combo while you are offline with whatever method you prefer(hint: perform an internet search).  Then you send all your coins there, even if you don't have a wallet/app setup with that private/public key combo.  In that case, the coins will belong to that address, even though you've actually never 'touched' it(just created it).
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:25:38
A lot do send, but we're talking about tiny amounts here.
I wanted to test it out and made an address that I only used on faucet type sites.  After 30 days of use everyday, which took about 15 minutes every day(totalling 7.5 hours after 30 days), the total balance on that address was .00017284.  Not even close to being worth it, like, you would make more money walking around picking up coins in parking lots.
As another experiment.  I made another address and used some of those 'perform tasks for bitcoins' sites.  Instead of spending 30 days, I just spent a total of 7.5 hours on them over the period of a few days.  It was mind numbingly boring, but the total balance on that new address was .08187250.  Much more profitable than the faucets for the same amount of time put in, but still not even a dollar an hour(not to count being much more boring and actually requiring you to focus your attention).
But, in all honesty...  The second method isn't a terribly bad option for someone who really just wants to play around with bitcoins a bit.  Just not a good option for making any money with your time.

My understanding is limited to bitcoin-qt.  So disregard this is you are using a different client, or keep reading if you're curious.
With that client, 100 empty addresses are **pre-made** and stored in the wallet upon creation.  When those addresses need to be used for something like change, the first of the 100 is used.  Now that there are 99 unused addresses(and 2 used addresses[your primary one and the newly funded change one]), a new empty address is created and added to the bottom of the 100 list.
So...  You will always have 100 empty addresses waiting to be used, and a numerous amount of used addresses that are making up the total balance of your wallet.
The thing to take away from all of this is that you should make a wallet backup frequently enough so that your most recent backup is no more than 100 change addresses behind.  This is because that backup will only know about the 100 empty ones that existed when it was backed up(plus the used ones), but it will not know any of the new ones that were created since the time of backup(which would start to happen once  was used).

The first problem you'll encounter if you don't want to 'handle the commerce', is that you'll need an outside handler, or at least a script, that can change the bitcoin payment amount dependent on the current market price.

Let's assume you are using bitcoin-qt, since it's the most popular client.
That program is actually a wallet as far as wording is concerned.  It contains your main address, the one you are probably familiar with.  It also contains numerous 'change' addresses that were created while you made outgoing transactions.  That is why it's a wallet.  Not because it holds your coins, but because it holds all of your addresses.
Realizing that, the balance you see in bitcoin-qt is not actually the balance of that main address.  It's actually the total balance of all those addressees combined.  If you look up your main address on blockchain.info, it's probably different than the balance you see in bitcoin-qt.
Following that understanding...  All you have to do is create a new address in bitcoin-qt(push a single button), and that address is added into your wallet.  Tell 1 person about it, they send you coins on it, and then those coins are inside your wallet.  You never have to tell anyone else about that address ever again.  No one will know your main address, and no one else will even know about that new address unless you speak about it.
Got a second customer?  Repeat the paragraph above that I just typed.  If you really want to remain completely anonymous, then there are a few more steps involved once you start spending those received coins.  But for the scope of our convo, I hope this makes enough sense.

I'm not sure what exactly you mean when you say 'valid key', but an outgoing transaction cannot be created without the involvement of the sender's private key.

There was one thing that [willphase]( didn't completely touch on in paragraph three.
Yes, if blockchain goes down, and you already imported your 'data'(by backing-up via download, dropbox, google drive, and/or email), you're technically good.  But if the storage device you saved the downloaded backup to gets lost(or dies), or dropbox goes down, or Google drive does down, or your email server goes down(**Or** you lose/forget the login credentials to any of those places)..  Well you get where I'm going with this.  That is not even mentioning if any of those things are compromised, which is another topic in itself.
The point to take away is that you should make sure that the information you need is located somewhere you know it will always be accessible(by at least two different 'locations' at any given time), and that the credentials necessary to retrieve it will always be remembered.  Also make sure that both of those things only apply to you, and nobody else.

So at that point, once it got that big...  The idiots would use bitcoin banks, and the rest would handle their finances entirely outside of banks if they so desired(how it is for current bitcoin users now).

For a moment, at least until I make the point I want to make...  Let's disregard that this topic relates to bitcoins, and look at the topic itself(Technology adoption rates since 1900, and using that to determine the status of bubble or not).
I feel like I have to point out that the historical adoption rate of new technologies does not determine if there was a bubble, or a lack thereof.  This is one of those situations where people will pick and choose which 'Technologies since 1900'  they want to pick, in order to support their theory/viewpoint...  All the while not mentioning just as many examples that would go against it.
I'm not trying to talk bitcoin down here.  I just wanna point out that this train of thought is not in any way, shape, or form, a good method of determining whether or not bitcoin is in a bubble(or any new technology for that matter).

I didn't want to include that into my post and make it even longer.  But yes, as [raging12] ( pointed out, banks are not necessarily a bad thing at the core of their definition, they just seem like they are, because of how they are being currently operated.
As far as your question about if there were any experiments where people pooled their BTC resources together, in order to have higher levels of security.  If you search for bitcoin scams on any search engine, you'll find your answer right away.  If you don't want to, yes they tried, people liked it, then they robbed them(or allegedly got hacked).
I like the last paragraph of your post.  That idea is actually a feature that has already programmed in bitcoin since it's inception(except your idea adds a little twist for paying out to a random person), it just isn't being implemented by any clients or wallets at the current time.

The receiver couldn't have an 'offline/sleeping' transaction that would broadcast, process, and pay him once he got online, unless he had the senders private key.  Which would obviously not be a good thing.
And ya, even if that was possible.  No way to protect against a double spend.
Cool idea in theory though, just no real way to implement it.
edit:  Actually I may be incorrect on the private key part.  A transaction could be 'compiled' by one person, given to another, and then that other person could broadcast it and get confirmations, all without the other person having the private key.  But there would still be the double spend problem.

I'm not sure myself if there is a way to find those change addresses from bitcoin-qt itself.
You can look up each of your outgoing transactions on blockchain.info.
Take this one for example:
*  The address 1Ma5...  wants to send 1HJMM... 0.00020221 BTC.
*  What happens is that 1Ma5... sends out 1.04270221 BTC.
*  After the .0005 fee is taken, that means 1.04220221 BTC is going out.
*  Now 0.00020221 BTC is going to 1HJMM...  Which was the whole point of this transaction.
*  That leaves 1.042 BTC that went out, but is actually change.
*  So you can see that an address 1Grm... got that 1.042 BTC.
*  That address would get added to the wallet where 1May... is at.
That person's wallet balance will reflect this amount, but the 1May address will appear 1.042 BTC short of what the wallet is saying.
Hopefully that makes sense.  That is the only way I know how to track change addresses if you are using bitcoin-qt.  But I could be mistaken.

I suggest tipping everyone who makes a post that doesn't involve a meme, and I mean EVERYONE, from here on out.  Make sure to mention that the tip is for 'not posting a meme'.  Also mention that you will be creating a blacklist consisting of anyone who posts a meme, and that you will never ever tip them..  Even if they provide you with life saving advice in the future.

Expanding on [Anenome5's]( explanation of what Satoshi Dice is.  If you want to get a real feel for just how 'spammy' it is to the bitcoin network....  Load up  and check out the bottom left area of the page(this is where the most recent bitcoin transactions are listed, in real time ).  
The Satoshi Dice addresses are 'registered' on blockchain, so you'll see "SatoshiDICE XX%" after any of their addresses in that transaction list.  It's quite literally 75% or more of all bitcoin transactions per minute, at most times.
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:14:09
If you are that new to bitcoins.  Just remember that an unconfirmed transaction is absolutely fine as long as you are on the sending end of that unconfirmed transaction.  It simply means that more time is needed to confirm(can vary wildly depending on certain aspects, but usually less than 10 minutes if a fee is included).
If you are on the receiving end, unconfirmed is almost always nothing to worry about either, except for certain(and rare) types of scenarios that you mentioned you are not yet ready to delve into.

Didn't notice that.
In that case, my new point is now that the exchange in the picture only conducted 19 trades in the last 25 minutes from before it was taken(and is only on a 24 hour scale).
I was just trying to be funny anyways.  But in all seriousness, the time-frame being shown and the exchange being used in that picture do not make a good case for(or against) stability.
And that's not even counting the volume of coins traded in the last 25 minutes shown in that picture.  Which is next to nothing, near 1 coin a minute.
@_date: 2013-04-07 11:23:54
You have to remember how simple it is to create new addresses(as well wallets that hold more than one address).  You don't have to choose just one, I'd actually argue the case that you should store and diversify your coins among more than just 1 wallet/address(depending on the amount of coins you possess).
Store a large amount in something considered 'safest', aka cold storage.  Have some coins stored on addresses that bitcoin-qt is aware of for 'quick shopping' on your main desktop/laptop, have a few addresses on a mobile/phone wallet for on-the-go spending/buying, etc...
But maybe you(or whoever is reading) don't have a lot of coins, and splitting them around like that just doesn't seem to make much sense..  As a general rule, I suggest, if you have enough coins that diversifying them among cold storage, desktop/laptop wallet, and mobile constrains your ability to use them, then you don't have enough to start yet worrying about these types of options.
If that is the case, just make sure that the amount you have is all in one secure place, until you have enough that you are ready to start spreading them around in such methods.
I know that your question was asking more about a particular wallet setup that allows semi-remote access, and that my post didn't really address or answer that.  But for some reason your question got me on this other train of thought.

No, it isn't.  Honestly.    
Even the most devoted bitcoin fans would agree on that(at least for the next 50 years).
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:16:30
I would advise giving her regular information, monthly perhaps.
Sure..  It would be great to let her know out of the blue, that her bitcoins are worth 8K.  It would be an amazing surprise to someone who knows nothing more than the fact that they gave you some cash in the hopes of you turning a profit on it.
But..  It would suck to tell her out of the blue, that her bitcoins are worth next to nothing.  Afterwards, it would suck even more when you tell her(or keep to yourself) that at one point they were worth 2 or 3 thousand, but you kept it a secret in hopes of really knocking her socks off with that 8K goal.
You know her better than I do though.  But personally, I would like to be updated regularly so that I could choose what to do with what is technically my money, or at least feel like I was being kept up to date so that I could take part in the decision.  I'm willing to bet she probably believes that what she has given you so far, is still worth about the same amount, give or take 10%.
@_date: 2013-04-04 11:12:25
No economic incentive?  I would argue that since most bitcoin merchants are currently offering incentive discounts for using bitcoin, that will more than likely mitigate the fees necessary for buying coins to recoup what was spent.  In most cases you will probably save some money because the discount is greater than the fee.  
Even if it was a small hit because of fees...  Looking at the long term, doing things like this will strengthen bitcoin's value and acceptance.  So..  Since you already have coins, the economic savings that you would receive from them being further accepted, as well as being worth more down the road, is a huge financial incentive.
As far as time, I'm assuming you mean the amount of time it would take for you to take possession of new coins to replace the ones you've just spent.  In that case, you've got me.  If you are so strapped for fiat/coins that waiting for a market transfer/buy to process will hinder your spending ability on a day to day basis, this solution might not be for you.  In fact, if you are in that type of financial situation, I would strongly advise not putting anything into bitcoin.  It is far too risky for someone in that financial position.
If by time you meant the hassle it takes to perform all these steps, compared to the time it takes performing   Well you've got me there again.  If all you are after is convenience and looking out for yourself, then  is certainly the best route.  I would argue that anyone who wants to help bitcoin become more accepted by merchants, as well as helping aid it's performance in exchanges, would deal with the mild inconvenience in order to help those bitcoin causes.
That's reason enough for me.  It's unfortunate that it isn't enough for you. :(

There are a few wallets that offer a dead man's switch.  The quick and dirty of it is, you set a time limit, and if that amount of time passes with no activity on the wallet, all funds are sent to whatever address you put in when you were setting the time limit.
Can't remember which wallets/services offer it.  But a quick google search should point you in a good direction.
It's not a great option from a security standpoint.  Much better to utilize a public/private key stored somewhere that goes along with a Will.

Yes, it would lead many investors to hoard theirs, while other people still decide to spend theirs instead.  I never argued that, I even said that I have no problem with a percentage of people doing that earlier, it's how things work.  But if everyone adopted the hoard attitude instead of just a percentage, bitcoin would inevitably drop in value to the point of being worthless.  We can't all hoard.  If the value ever skyrockets, the hoarders who become rich will hopefully realize it happened because other people were spending it, causing more and more merchants to accept it, giving more people more places to spend it.  So on and so on.
It won't raise in value because of hoarding, at least not in this stage of the game.  It needs to be spent to gain worth as a currency.  We need merchants to accept it so we can spend it.  That is what this thread is about.  It is not about investing like a stock.  It is about making it more widely accepted by merchants, so that we can pay those merchants in bitcoin.  
Did you read the original post? How do you not get this?

That would be great if it could happen.  But the government isn't going to get involved to the level of providing what we currently know as FDIC insurance, without some sort of cut from the pie.  At which point the differences between fiat and btc only get closer(or at least only for the people who choose to use their services).
Which begs the question, why then would those people switch from fiat to bitcoin in the first place?  Only to help *us* out, the one's who can handle their btc on their own?  Very doubtful that they'd have that opinion.
I'm not talking bitcoin down, I love it.  But I'm trying to point out that it cannot be adopted widely as it currently stands(because it does not safeguard 'idiots'), and any steps used to provide those safeguards would negate many of the reasons bitcoin was created in the first place..
Which begs the question, what is the point, in the long run?

Your client knows and remembers these new addresses.  The problem is that your backup does not.
So in one example...  You make a backup.  Then you end up using exactly 100 empty addresses and your hard drive takes a dive.  You would load the backup, it would sync with the blockchain and see that all 100 empty addresses it was storing have been used.  All 100 of those would merge into your 'used' addresses area, and it would generate a new empty 100.  Nothing lost.
In another example...  You make a backup.  Then you end up using exactly 147 empty addresses, and boom your hard drive dies.  You would load the backup, it would sync with the blockchain and see that all 100 empty addresses it was storing have been used.  All 100 of those would merge into your 'used' addresses area, and it would generate a new empty 100.  Unfortunately, the backup would know nothing about the 47 newly created ones.  So the balance of 47 addresses are lost.
Make enough sense?

Actually, since I'll keep it up, and you seem to be informed about prostitution...  I've got a question.
What happens if you pick up a prostitute, and pay her for being an actress?  Meaning, you take her home(or to your 'studio'), have sex with her while it's being filmed, put it on your internet subscription based porno site, and then pay her?
Is it still prostitution, or are you just hiring someone to be involved in your porno 'biz'.

Then how are you going to pay the idiots to mow your 50 acre estate, or clean your olympic sized pool?  I get what you're saying, but anything implemented on a large scale has to accommodate the lowest common denominator, and that definitely includes finances and money handling..
Your statement is akin to all the 'fatcats' wishing that that they could buy a large island to all live on together, just so they wouldn't have to exist among the 'plebs'.  It simply wouldn't work.

Ignorance also causes 'dumb' people to adopt a personal viewpoint that agrees with the ideas they hear being told to them(aka sheep in a herd).  In this case, those ideas are bad things being said about bitcoin, most particularly that it is a bubble.
You could argue that you don't want 'dumb' people on your side anyways.  But when I hear so many people complain about how dumb other people are(especially on internet forums/boards), you have to at least acknowledge that their numbers are large, and therefore can be very detrimental(or helpful) to ideas and causes.

Don't worry.  If you see them in the blockchain, it's just a matter of time until they are confirmed.
The only way that wouldn't happen is if they were double spending them.  And if a betting site wanted to cheat you, they would just keep them in the first place, they wouldn't send and then double spend to negate the send.

In short, yes.

So, I'm not trying to speak down to you..  But I can't think of a better way to word this, so I'm just gonna say it as I originally intended to type it:
"Your entire argument is based on there being(or a lack thereof) a central authority?"
I actually agree with you.  Just don't like the way you presented your argument.  But on that topic of authorities(not central), if bitcoin ever gets that big, there will **definitely** be places for idiots to secure their amounts, or at least a place where they can be insured and/or place blame away from themselves if shit starts to fly with their coins.
If anything, that security offered would be an idiot-surcharge.  Which everyone who claims to be smart has always joked about being necessary.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:09:16
In that case...  Whatever the exchanges currently say it is.  Remember that this value only applies during the second you check it, and what it's value will be in the following second is unknown.
Look up the definition of volatility in relation to economics, which will explain how to determine bitcoin's 'price' value.  It will also explain why no one has been able to give you a good answer, that is not based on personal opinion.
Outside of that, it is not widespread enough to have it's value based on other things(fundamental or not)...  Such as GDP, retail sales, or unemployment; which you mentioned in a different reply.

For arguments sake.  Try to pretend that you don't know anything about debit cards or computers/internet, at all.
Are you imagining that?  Ok, good.  
Now pretend that I give you a laptop and hand you a Chase bank debit card and tell you that your name is John, your account number is 373826153270, your card security code is 592, your pin number is 1287, your internet bank login is John:abc123.  I then walk away and wish you the best of luck in your financial life.  
How well would you do at the grocery store, an ATM, or with a web browser?  You would probably say fuck it and go back to hard cash and using checks.
The point I'm trying to make is that the technical aspects of Bitcoin are not necessarily difficult to understand, it's just that they are simply unknown by most people.  There is honestly no difference at the core of each, you just perceive a difference because you are familiar with a certain method.  If you were ignorant to both, they would both seem equally as complicated.
If there was an alternative universe where bitcoin was the main way finances were done since the dawn of their modern society, banks and credit cards would seem just as complicated to them as bitcoins are to the 'idiots' you are speaking of.
