This an extra layer of security for big coin holders like exchanges. No one In there right mind would accept a reverseable transaction so the public is not at risk. However an exchange could keep most coins in that wallet so even if somehow the cold wallet got hacked it would be pretty worthless because the coins would be reversible (and any group with that many coins will have more then one person that can reverse it). Even if the hacker got the private key and would reverse there reverse trasaction it would still keep rhe coins out of the hackers hands and imo would make it alot less beneficial

Telegram is secure as far as i can tell  . The only downside is that the telegram team made there own encryption protocol BUT so far its been passing everything with flying colors. 
There is also GetGems with Telegram which is the telegram client but reskined, a bitcoin wallet added to it, and optable advertising channels where users can earn earn gems.

How about instead of trying to fix this with another softfork/update we fix it by pushing companys who haven't yet adopted segwit to adopt it. If they do we will see the fees drop. I think this should be more then enough to hold us over until LN network is out.

"Even gold and silver will not be very valuable in the long run. They are commodities, and technology will find a way to increase supply.
However, Bitcoin is the capital that will power the machines that make human labor redundant. As a human, you should not view Bitcoin as a risky investment, but as a life insurance policy that you absolutely must have.
This is a dark view of the future, but we live in a dark present, where human life is not valued.
Buy Bitcoin."

Do you really think it would be hard to incorporate a field, or tag to add a city/state you are in to send taxs to? EVery citizen must provide an address and the goverment can EASILY (blockchain analyzation tech will make this effortless) see that the coins where spent legitimately.

Where you forced to trade on mt.gox? Bitcoin does not need MT.Gox. Bitcoin is not mt.gox . mt.gox was a 3rd party service that relyed on bitcoin... not the other way around. 
It doesnt matter how safe,secure,unhackable, valuable, or omnipotent your money is if you give the control away to a bad actor.
When you send coins to mt.gox you sent them to mt.gox, and they controlled the private keys which means they owned the coins FULLY. Its like if you transfer the title of the car to your girlfriend and she dumps ya, sure it was your care but you gave her the title(private keys).

Big difference. Let's assume you had cash when the Greece banks went down, you where basically uneffected. Let's say you have btc in a wallet on your pc when mt.gox went down , you where uneffected. The difference? Bitcoin offers bank-level security when you store it on YOUR WALLET. Storing coins on mt.gox is the equivalent of storing your cash in a 3rd world bank which has no regulations, no proof of reserve. Would you send your money to that 3rd world bank and expect it to be safe??? Hell no

If a fork ends up spliting the community into the good actors and bad actors im for it. The market will resolve itself and the bad actors will go broke trying to scam themselfs. (hopefully this is what happens with bitcoin cash).
Part of bitcoins brand imo is that its a permission-less technology, meaning anyone can decide to add on to it. Even if it results in a bitcoin cash or w.e.
However you are definitely right that hardforks can be ugly and its not something we should wish for.

If you want to look at it as a currency remember its still only 9 years old compared to the hundrands of years other fiat has been around. As a currency alot of volatility is because of how small it is, it terms of market cap qe are still tiny. As small as it is rn i think it would be silly to use it as a currency unless ur in like Venezuela. Im not saying you cant buy stuff with it im just saying to use it as a daily currency its be silly due to its viotillity.

Take this into perspective. Lets assume that you want to send some data over the BTC network, you need to pay fees right? Lets say you need a fee of 0.0002, well since you're device came preloaded you already spent all your BTC and to start using the BTC network you need to buy more BTC! not a problem right? Well you're in africa with only a internet connection &amp; electricity and nothing else your shit outa luck! HOWEVER with this device you mine BTC passively meaning you ALWAYS have BTC to transact with the network. Further this is amazing for developing nations with no ways to keep buying BTC, if you where in syria right now how would get BTC? Maybe you where looking to sign a couple last messages that you wanted in the blockchain forever? Maybe you want...... well you can fill in the blanks. Also id argue that making an API costs money, not free.

Ok so now when your fridge,roster, ect ect needs btc you gonna fund them all? Imagine a house hold has 40 of these devices, you going to load all of them with 400$ or are they going to share a wallet? Are you going to encrypt these wallets? Or would you rather the device be able to convert some electricity and have the btc without you even interacting? 
And that's the shitier argument for the chip.
You want the real value? Getting on the blockchain with NO REGISTRATION,  How else you going to do that? You going to have your refrigerator hooked up to a faucet? Lol

"To best understand how cryptocurrency works, think about videogames. You have a virtual world, and within this realm, you can often earn virtual currency, which can then be redeemed for rewards within the game--extra armor, more lives, cooler clothes. It's the same here, except that it's rooted in blockchain technology and (theoretically) you can either convert the play money into the real thing or deploy it for actual goods and services inside the entity that spawned it."
I dont think they understand how bitcoin works at all.
