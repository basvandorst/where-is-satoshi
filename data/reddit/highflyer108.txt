Ok thanks

So if the account key is hardened you can't even access all the keys of that account?
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:57:35
Okay, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:51:45
Oh thanks, I just looked at the wallet section of bitcoincash.org and didn't see anything. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:01:05
How did they buy BCH you mean?
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:42:30
Yeah and you could actually do it before this block since they have forked about 5 hours ago. I got my transaction into this block.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:47:31
[This]( website will let you know when BCH has forked
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:26:43
Zimbabwean dollar probably already has
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:52:18
Yeah block explorers still need to update their nodes.

@_date: 2017-08-01 18:53:40
There's no mobile wallet for BCH right now AFAIK. The wallet I use is [electron]( (a fork of electrum).
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:12:37
But it's very easy to switch between mining BCH and BTC compared to other alts
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:50:20
100% of the mining network is now supporting SegWit so this won't help it activate. And there was a fork planned today for SegWit (Called the UASF or BIP 148) but it didn't fork because all miners are signalling for SegWit now.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:10:49
That's what I'm thinking, if BCH crashes very quickly I will definitely be holding it because if the segwit2x HF fails, a lot of big blockers will be flocking to BCH (Bitmain have said if the 2mb HF fails they will support BCH). And a lot of hardcore Core supporters seem to hate the very idea of 2mb blocks so it's going to be interesting...

Hey it's me, ur op...
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:34:38
Electrum and Armory are wallets I'm 100% sure are ready, and there's probably a lot more since Devs have had a while now to update their wallets. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:15:13
Well I think you can broadcast BCH transactions before the first block is mined. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:36
It’s the shorting that would cause the price to drop though.

How do you verify the checksum of a mnemonic generated according to BIP39?
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:10:36
Just one more question, if I wanted to make it a testnet address would I just substitute the 0x05 with a 0xC4 like a normal P2SH address?
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:19:53
And electrum
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:42:50
~~Ok, so would I hash160 (0x0014{pub-key hash}) ?~~ Edit: NVM this doesn't seem to work for me...
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:43:33
Ah ok I get it now. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:02:18
It's because they derive their addresses from different paths of the xpub. See [BIP44](

@_date: 2017-10-15 11:46:25
For all other versions you just needed to run the installer again and your wallets were fine, but if you want to use SegWit you'll need to make a new wallet anyway.

Do Coinbase hold 2 keys or 1 key?
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:04:42
Sorry, I meant how would I implement it in something like a python script.

@_date: 2017-07-27 10:26:10
There is no way to know how the markets will react, but IMO I doubt the price will drop by a half as bitcoin cash futures are currently on viaBTC for less than 0.2 btc a coin. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:07:19


I think you meant bear market
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:09:10
We're already in the new signalling period. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:37:09
The new DNS hasn't propagated fully yet
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:11:08
You got it the wrong way around except for bitcoin.com...
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:53:35
I wouldn't say it's the mining that's centralised but the distribution of ether itself. The foundation has more than 10% of all coins in circulation. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:01:26
As long as &gt;50% signal SegWit it's practically guaranteed to get activated because the minority not signalling SehWit will be orphaned. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:31:07
It's an L not an i.

Here you go, now I'll take 21 bitcoins please 
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:03:21
And a third altcoin split off from core most likely...
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:03:24
Send them to [electrum]( 
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:38:29
They don't control the supply though. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:13:54
It would take a while for everyone to upgrade their software and it would just create a huge mess. AFAIK you **could** just schedule softfork tomorrow if you wanted but it wouldn't get much support. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:21:18
A lot, he was an early investor in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:47:41
Well you could just remember a seed for your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:01:03
So if I wanted to keep the wallet I have now I should move all my bitcoin into a new electrum wallet *now*, and then send the bitcoin from that into my old wallet after the fork?
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:03:38
Shit it seems like you're everywhere giving away btc, be careful you don't run dry :P
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:31:34
Lol ok redditor for 0 days...
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:47:12
Well bitfinex have already said it would use BCH as the ticker. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:15:22
Why would they not want the tx fees?
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:02:20
Yep, litecoin wallet has all transactions show up as unverified. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:09:46
Bitmain have said they won't mine on BCC if the 2mb HF is successful (obviously if you believe them or not is up to you)
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:03:33
To make sure that there is actual consensus among miners and there is not just a lucky string of blocks signalling for something that a minority of miners want. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:26:51
Mycelium is a good wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:26:03
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:50:10
As long as you don't make any transactions until everything has settled you will be perfect.
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:20:06
Yeah but we also got unlucky with the timing because signalling is split into different periods of blocks (every 2016 blocks I believe?) and we are already too far into this period of signalling to activate it so we will have to wait for the next 2016 blocks. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:10:47
The only people panicking are the ones that left it to the last minute to move their coins off exchanges. Most people have all their coins kept where they are until the fork is over. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:06:50
If he payed with bitcoin he would still legally have to pay capital gains on it. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:51:02
They are on an electrum wallet now but I want to keep the transaction history on it, but electrum say I will have to use that wallet for BCC after you have the BTC off it and moved to a new wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:00:33
You should also look into getting an offline wallet where you control your own private keys. Try [electrum]( it's pretty easy to use. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:10:07
No $3000 (on GDAX anyway) is the ATH.

Also follow up question: Does Segwit2x disable AsicBoost?
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:02:22


Do you know what wallet I could do this with?
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:44:38
I won't need an electrum server as I'll be broadcasting signed transactions from the offline raspberry pi from my online electrum wallet on my PC. Unless I'm missing something?
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:48:58
[Looks like it](
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:48:41
Ok thanks for the quick reply. Btw do you use wirex? If you do would you recommend them because I would like to be able to sell bitcoin when it's high and use the fiat and not have to worry about using the card on the dips. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:33:05
Just set up a Coinbase account using your parents ID and bank account info/ credit card info and pay them back using your cash.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:11:32
By settlements do you mean large transactions? Sorry if it's a dumb question.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:32:38
Yeah lol this isn't something they should be proud of tbh
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:05:51
Is the fear of centralization from larger blocks because of the fact that the file size becomes larger and harder to store on PCs?
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:41:48
If they lock in BIP91 and don't signal for Bip141 they will orphan their own mined blocks though. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:31:21
Is it because they need to download a bigger blockchain size?
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:30:03
They're doing the 2X part later anyway. It's activating Segwit first. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:34:38
Without at least some miner support though block times will be painfully slow as the difficulty wont be able to adjust quick enough
