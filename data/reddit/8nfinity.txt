Gemini is the standard .25% fee for purchases. Often cheaper than coinbase and they cover your transferring fees out. Incredibly easy and quick

0% maker fee? Wow. That's nice. I'm not sure since I don't use gdax.

I keep the majority of my coins on a hardware wallet, but obviously I don't carry that around. For instances like this, do people keep some on their phone (either an android or iphone wallet)?

Can anyone she'd light on the significance of auction trading versus just setting a limit order to buy and sell? I tried reading g through but didn't fully grasp the advantages of it. Thanks

You said does anyone actually do that? I told you which people do.

Of course. Does it make sense if you made $100? No probably not. What about 1000? Eh still maybe not. 10000? 100000? 1000000? At some point if you want to use that money you need to be able to explain it to the irs

Where/how do you lend and at what rate?

I moved my coins from gemini to electrum. I should be fine and get both coins at the end of the day correct?

From what I read they haven't fully confirmed they are going to but probably going to. So I was trying to be proactive
