I'll send it after 60 days that's the policy for charge back and disputes. 
You could buy something for example a sheet of blank folded paper and I'll ship it to your address via tracking usps/ups and no chance of disputes that will go through. 
Still too much work unless it's at a $=&gt;BTC loss instead of 230ish more like 230ish

Never used you guys but look forward to this. I have never hear of this service I use gyft which I like very much I pay and show my Barcode and it shows my Balance quick and can use the Starbucks reward members login too. Now with you using 20% this seem more promising for an app I'll use I'll update once I use it!

I have done a few with this guy and none have been reversed it's been a couple of weeks for a couple of them. 
I am glad you guys confirmed my speculations. I will be stopping these now.

Wow very comprehensive! I agree with so much here. I would love to keep adding to my "savings" with BTC and your suggestion is spot on. I would love to find more accepting traders and use the small amount buy/use for as much as possible. I am excited because I am moving to the outskirts of Atlanta soon and I think this will help so much.
I have been raving so much to my friends and even got a serious investor involved in BTC and it felt so good. With people set in their old ways and with this "made up" money as someone who told me offers resistance to my flow upstream but users like you restore my faith in the currency and community. Thank you for your advice. I'll keep a look out for more merchants to convince amd try my best to contribute to the cause of a good community name.
