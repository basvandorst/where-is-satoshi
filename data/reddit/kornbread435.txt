I'm in East Tennessee, and it's $3.10 today.

Eh. Close enough.

400oz in 12.5kg at $1237 per ounce so $494,880 per bitcoin.

Not going to lie, it annoys me your jingle came after the slogan.

I don't even know who that is actually.

Bank transfers are not easily reversed, and they required me to verify my bank account with username and password. While I'm sure people could possibly set up some scam somewhere, and if it's possible it will likely be done. They could easily allow instant transfers on transactions under $100 and limit the number of transactions. People steal, it's built into prices with everything we buy. Treating every customer as a theif and making it so difficult to get entry to the currency has been the biggest issue with bitcoin I've ran into.

Not if you have sizable student loans you took on to get that income. :(

I'll give you that, 2 day shipping would be $5-6 + materials. Haven't had any problems with first class though.

This is solid, you win I'll buy another tenth.

I was going to pick up a couple flavors to try your line out, but $7 to ship two 10ml bottles is pretty high. $0.50 padded envelope + $1.50-2 shipping cost ≠ $7.

Wouldn't each stores inventory and the warehouses be a reserve for these coins? I mean sure it's not the same ingredients on any given day, but they all have a stable volume of ingredients. They might even increase the reserves if they anticipate a lot of coins being redeemed.

Can someone give me a eli5 for this thing?

I would slowly cash it out and pay off my student loans, you're a better person than me. I would also fear lawsuits over it.
