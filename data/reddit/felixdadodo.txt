I understand your premise, but it doesn't really answer whether someone can get involved in it this late in the game. But thanks for this.

Also, thanks for the advice on the bitminers, probably the safest bet for me. Kudos man.

This is a great way to put it to me, thanks for the insight! ☺

Literally, I had no idea of these new algorithms until I went on coinwarz earlier today. I new of the newer scrypt algorithm, but that was it.

Nice, thanks man, I'll be sure to check it out! 
@_date: 2014-07-11 19:16:30
In my dreams, yes. In reality, I'm probably nearly 30k in debt as a student lmao.

Damn that would be pretty awesome, my friend had over 1000 BTC at one point but when he spent it all on drugs, it was worth as much as the million dollars he could of got for it haha!

I calculated an 86 day turn around. I think 2 months is a bit ambitious to be fair.

My bad, thought I'd come to the larger party to ask. Will redirect myself next time. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 19:20:22
I pretty much just want an ROI and the experience. Thanks for your insight dude.

Yeah, I priced up a rig I wanted to build in March, but backed out, would of given me 1.5 Mh/s for about 450 quid. Was pretty efficient. It was using gtx 750 SC gfx cards on maxwell architecture. Probably would of made my money back to be fair. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 16:32:01
That's a good way to look at it, I didn't think about it like that! 
@_date: 2014-07-11 19:18:29
Yeah, I have a good understanding, just no actual practical experience, which would be nice to have. Thanks for your opinion man. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 19:11:16
That's another way to look at it, the ms for the insight. If could imagine some people would be like that but then again some may welcome the extra power to the network.

Pretty much yes to all those questions except for capital. I'm a student, so small scale is where I would plant my feet. I was looking at an Asic that had a break even 86 days down the line in the current climate, with an I initial investment of around £300, energy isn't wildly expensive here either. But then again, it's capital. I can't go large scale in my situation. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 19:13:47
Yeah I think you're right it's a rich man's game now. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 19:17:43
Yeah, I'd be happy to get an ROI, that would make me happy.
