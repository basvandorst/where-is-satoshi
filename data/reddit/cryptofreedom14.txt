check out blockstream working with ICE (NYSE parent company) about to launch a data feed for crypto markets.

dollar cost average in. buy back in pieces so that if it goes back down tomorrow you can buy more
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:08:42
i would even be inclined to feed you in hopes that it would be that one good deed that would pay off one day when you get your life together... but based on your comments you seem like a lazy ass that isn't going to amount to much so for those reasons..... I'm out.

thanks didn't know that. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:45:01
they are gonna work together on a data feed for crypto markets. maybe in the future they will have a exchange that has lightning payments

It also hit the 100 MA those other times too. maybe it will hit that line before the bull run
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:02:28
thanks just set up my paper wallet!
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:14:42
oh and I'm only 23 myself you control your own life!
@_date: 2018-05-10 03:16:44
Any idea who actually owns that account? I think its hilarious, just curious.
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:38:42
There is some truth to this but also the kid may learn a valuable lesson by putting $100 in bitcoin. If he panic sells the first dip that will be a hard lesson to learn, but if he holds and treats it like a retirement account, adding to it when he earns more money, and in 10 years has a nice reward for holding, that will show the power of investing for the future. Either way he stands to learn how important saving for the future is, and if he can grasp the concept of DCA and not panic selling at this young of an age that will be valuable moving forward. Also not to sell and blow your money the first time you gain $5 worth of value ha.

It actually reached to a market cap around 800,000 i believe 
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:49:44
Yeah I noticed that when I sent btc to my ledger a while later the receive address changed, so I think whether you want to or not your btc is on multiple addresses but under the one wallet. Is this correct?
@_date: 2018-10-20 15:46:08
I don't think I said they are actually on the device. I was asking if it is good to break up your coin in to a few wallets or if it doesn't matter and is just as secure all in one wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:55:39
you will likely find that you are not very successful in guessing which will rise and which will fall. That is why people say if your not a trader don't try to be a trader.  
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:49:11
Your wrong people trade currencies just like they do stocks. Look up the FOREX market.
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:53:20
You have no idea what industry I work in first off. And second, exchanges like coinbase and I’m guessing Abra, cannot tell you why they denied you service. This isn’t an argument your just wrong. Charlie lee worked at coinbase and he has said several times they cannot by law tell you why you were denied. 
You should probably change careers you sound like you don’t know much. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:14:46
okay yeah the products are more valuable against our currency your describing inflation. the USD absolutely gets less valuable every year you cant even refute that. yeah sure if you set yourself up you can make your money last. that doesnt change the fact that inflation exists, you can look up the yearly rate
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:19:16
What if they are gonna implement the coinbase merchant setup. maybe thats another reason for ditching paypal?
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:33:00
Its not a conspiracy theory. just look up fractional reserve banking. why has the federal reserve never been audited? they don't have money in reserves like they say. if we all went to our bank right now and tried to withdraw our money, they would have only a small portion of it. this could not happen with bitcoin.  
Edit: Also this is the first time we have a technology to get off this corrupt system, and if we don't take action we are just passing it off to the next generation kinda like global warming. Furthermore, even if you do not believe in global warming, you at least agree its possible right? and if you had a technology to eliminate that possibility you would use it right? My point being that even if you don't believe that the federal reserve is corrupt or that fractional reserve banking is a real issue, we have a technology to eliminate that possibility so why wouldn't you?
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:07:49
I don't think BTC has to be perfect right now. I'm sure there could be a layer added to address this and if not there could be another cryptocurrency for loans with interest. 
But our current system has obviously been failing and hasn't been fixed. they wont even audit the Fed. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:33:53
Of course there will be some sot of profession in finance always. But i also feel like you can accomplish a good bit in finance without getting a 4 year degree in it. unless you could get a degree in cryptofinance or something ha. anyways my point I feel like your degree should be something that cant be obtained without university. for example I am pretty sure there are ways you can get certifications to work in finance without necessarily a degree. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:13:54
I do agree with this, but i have also been educating myself on the federal reserve system. reading books like "the creature from Jekyll island" etc.. and i do see that we need a change in our financial system and as the cryptocurrency infrastructure progresses it offers us a way to get off the crooked system in a way we have not had before. Crypto offers a way to make your statement by getting off the fiat system and that can be very powerful the more it is realized.  
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:42:39
Your getting away from my point that the fractional reserve banking and the fact that the federal reserve has never been audited makes another 2008 type crisis eminent. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:11:01
Your a dumbass, its the other way around. they can't, by law, tell you why they denied you service. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:26:19
I believe that freedom is more important than safety. In this new system it’s very important to keep track of your keys and be responsible about how you store your value. Also I am willing to bet people have had way more cash taken than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:20:08
Have that gun store implement the coinbase commerce app, that way people can buy guns with crypto and they will have a direct way to cash out when they want.
 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:59:08
read the bitcoin whitepaper and do some research.... you'll be back whether you want to or not 
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:31:35
The chairman of the CFTC even said himself today that there is no distributed ledger blockchain without bitcoin. How can you try to spread FUD about something even the regulators know cant be true.
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:07:30
You sound like a genius. You seem so quick to say coinbase is a loss of freedom but yet we all use debit cards and central banking system. coinbase is a step in the right direction. you dont have to keep all your coins there just the ones you spend, just like a checking account. if you cant see the benefit then you probably dont have enough coins to matter anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:48:36
I’m sure there will be bitcoin loans and all of that. But to address your question on how our current system is failing, have you ever tried to take out a large amount from your bank and been told they can’t give you that much? That’s happened to me. 
Why wouldn’t they have the full amount that’s in my account? That won’t happen with bitcoin. Also remember 2008? They were to lenient with their lending and caused a crash. 
You think the federal reserve actually has the reserves? We wouldn’t know because it’s NEVER been audited. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:39:09
But did you buy??
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:26:47
I thought the same thing. switched my degree to biophysics. Also i feel like so much information is available about finance without getting a 4 year degree in it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:13:30
you would agree though that if you feel inexperienced and/or you have unsuccessfully tried to sell and get back in at the right times then holding or hodling may be the best strategy for someone like that? 
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:45:40
Nice tinfoil hat there fella. The masses are still on the central banking system, so yes coinbase is a step in the right direction for the average person to get exposer to crypto. I think your stretching by saying the coins are tainted ha. Like you might end up with some coins that were from Silk Road, are those tainted? Should you track every coin you buys history? Come on that’s a bit much. I don’t really care if my hundred dollar bill has been used to snort coke off a strippers ass, so why do I care it coinbase has “tainted” the btc I’m gonna buy and then send to a paper/hardware wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:22:12
Once you send it you can see the transaction and how many confirmations it has on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:12:12
Freedom from banks. Freedom from a currency that is less valuable every year.

@_date: 2018-04-24 01:07:14
I would be weary of anybody who attempts to explain to you exactly what happened because chances are their full of shit
