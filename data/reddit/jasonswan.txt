Hey there, do you know if you can SSH into these and setup other services on them?

Hey there, I own the website: 
It pains me every time I see these lists of faucets that hardly pay anything out.  If you take about 2-4 minutes you can complete an offer on our website and easily earn between $0.50-$1.50.  That'd be like a months worth of faucet farming or more.
We've very active and completely transparent with our payout process, we've paid out about 13 BTC to our users to date, I would suggest you check us out!
Heres our bitcoin talk thread for lots more info:

Nice try, miner.

Will we be able to SSH and have root on the box?

Table 'bitcoin.smf_boards' doesn't exist
Whats a smurf board

If you want to make fractions of cents, then yeah goto some faucets, but if you want to make actual dollars goto a site like 
And no your wallet is not private info at all.

Theres clearly a ton of conflict of interest, and alot of really bad apples amongst mods.
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:41:35
Done. :)
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:16:05
Thats not how this works, thats not how any of this works. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:41:31
Oh Blockstream, you mean that company that got 21 million in funding to improve the bitcoin with side-chains with lightning network?
SoOoo Weird.. its almost like theres an incentive here to keep the current bitcoin-core gimped so a company can centralize "faster" transactions..
This is what we've turned into.

They are really trying to stop XTs growth by stonewalling all communication, absolutely *crazy*.
There must be *strong* incentives for higher ups/mods to stifle growth and keep the system gimped.

If you have a BITNODES HARDWARE and want to run the new XT Core, I've made some instructions:
    # XTs build apparently needs libcurl to compile or else configure fails, this wasn't on the bitnodes I have by default.
    sudo apt-get install curl libcurl4-openssl-dev
    cd ~
    git clone 
    cd bitcoinxt
    git checkout 0.11A
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --without-gui --without-miniupnpc --disable-wallet
    # This next step takes alot of RAM, you'll need to shutdown the supervisor and bitcoind process first to clear up some RAM, otherwise you'll get an "internal compiler error".
    make
    make check
    cp src/bitcoind src/bitcoin-cli ~/bin/
    # Disables auto updating
    rm ~/hardware/.current_bitcoind
    # Reboot so system/supervisor/bitcoind will come back up cleanly.
    sudo shutdown -r now

Pretty much this.
Despite the XT topic being 1000% on topic to bitcoin, it is literally deciding factor if people want to switch to larger block sizes or not.  
There is clear motive and incentives for current mods to silence and censor any discussion of the topic which should tell you where things are headed, and where you should go.

This dude is beyond fucked in comprehensive/reasoning skills.

He actually did a good job, not bad for a TEDx talk
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:24:07
Yep, nothing happens until miners do anything, we could have 100% nodes and it would do nothing.  Hope that makes sense now!
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:05:59
Its not an "alt-coin" it *is* bitcoin.  Stop trying to use words like "altcoin" to stifle traction &amp; growth.  An alt coin lives on seperate chains...  BitcoinXT literally uses the SAME blockchain Bitcoin-Core does, it is *the* exact same in everyway except that XT is improving on Core's inadequacies.

I'm unsure if Thermos was actively involved but this guy was HEAVILY modding, look at his post history too, very ignorant over the XT thing.

web dev here, adding &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; to the header would probably fix this, I have seen that fix alot of character encoding issues.

"using bitcoin tech"... sooo anything that uses SHA256/AES is bitcoin tech now?
@_date: 2015-04-10 00:03:52
I can't remember where I saw it, but I thought I saw one of the bitcoin core devs actually say that by limiting BW, you could actually be harming the network rather than doing it good.
@_date: 2015-04-10 00:09:57
I love how they keep using the phrase "no customer data was compromised".
Sorry, but having someone else get all the emails of your users and send them a phishing email, is THE definition of customer data compromise. Jesus

Too bad someone couldn't convert this to some kind of roller coaster simulator, so we could literally ride the bitcoin!

This is absolutely BONKERS.  With all the things that have been brought to light since then, it should *absolutely* be a re-trial.  
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:10:49
Bad press sometimes good press? The latest scandal is all over major news outlets, perhaps people are looking up bitcoin and buying in on some?
@_date: 2015-03-24 22:02:38
Web dev here, would you guys be willing to put together a full feature list of what kind of tunables you would like to see? I'm curious as to what things would need to be managed.
