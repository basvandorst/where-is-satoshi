Changed my BTC's into Segwit mode on my Trezor... hope that helps to speak out my support for the Core group...
Keep BTC decentralized and free... keep up the great work.

With all information been written, the readers should consider and educate themselves intensively about the reasons of the disagreement of the solutions. There is a lot of disinformation going around. 
Main importance is that Bitcoin and the Blockchain should BY ALL MEANS stay DECENTRALIZED...! ! !
We're talking about a lot of money and power, and money and power corrupts. The main players - the miners want to have this power and investors should be very weary of who is doing what.
Follow the leads and you will find that one of the main companies behind mining computers has already build in a sneaky backdoor to manipulate the rules. Then follow who is behind which solution and you can figure out which solution you want to support. That is for me the main reason why I stay with the Core. Decentralized is the key ! ! !

I have been reading my a$$ off since 2014 about BTC. First going slowly, buying a Trezor after reading whatever I could. I even made my own Google sheet to calculate my profits.
Now there are a lot of new beginning investors and they need to find a way between all the boobytraps [scams] so you could start an honest, independent consulting company. 
I don't want to do that because I want to stay much below the radar of [government] crooks, etc. but maybe it is and idea for some of you.
