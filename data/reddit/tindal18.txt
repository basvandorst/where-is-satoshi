Satoshi is/was Hal Finney. Too many coincidences 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:31:32
Great post. Something tells me it’s still Finney. 
I find it interesting about the email patterns and estimated time zone based on sleep which would infect to against the Hal Finney speculation but either way. What a man

The SEPA payment needs to be authorised by the bank and received in the euro wallet in Coinbase as stated above. Your account is not authorised until this is done. 
Looks like you have to send another SEPA payment. Ideally with another bank if you current bank is refusing to process it. 
In my experience HSBC allow them. 
Hope that helps

Scan the QR if it has one. If not enter the keys on an exchange. Good luck most are delayed AF

We’re all fucked and the world is going to end... 
BTC will rise like a Phoenix from the ashes and peck out the eyes of BCH. Coinbase will take a blow as the tooth of the BCH will stab through the book of forks freeing LTC from its enchantment allowing BTC and LTC to go join ETH on their journey to defeat the dark lord... I mean the one who must not be named. 
All the while XRP and his dirty friends XMR and IOTA plot against the hapless trio. 
Sooo by my calculation it’s all dependant on the strength of the Wingardium Leviooooooossssaaaahhhhhh

Basically someone locking in a buy price for the future so say 90 days. While another wants to ensure a guaranteed price at a certain date so agreed to sell at that amount on that day. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:24:49
That’s makes no sense. BCH will be made available for millions of hyped and normally poorly researched buyers on an easy to use platform. 
Only issue I see if trading halts and temporary dips in BTC LTC and ETH 
If you’re brave sell all and re-buy in the dip. 
BCH will spoke huge amounts and will join the waves of Crypto all will then find a steady ground and the cycle starts again. 
In short BCH will not crash today. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:50:28
I agree there should be an age. I suggest 2.99 days

95% of wall st think it’s a bubble so they’d take the risk to sell at 11k in 3m and someone else will obv agreed to pay 11k in 3m thinking BTC will have surpassed that figure.

I pity anyone who lists a buy order for 9k!! There was a handle of buy orders settled at 6-8k have a look at the book on cryptowat.ch GDAX BCHUSD

No you’ll need to type in the key manually into the exchange wallet address when depositing. 
And you there above. I assume the guy was able to comprehend doing this on an exchange not a random QR reader... jeeeees

I think it’s overreaction.
Coinbase wouldn’t  have won whatever they did. 
If you’re genuinely concerned then grab a hardware wallet and get out of Coinbase. 
I personally have a reasonable about in Coinbase and I’m happy to keep there. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:42:11
Such good advice. 
If you have belief in the coin then a 25% price drop doesn’t change that. It’s irrational behaviour and it costs the market billions. 
Make and informed decision and stay with it unless significant information changes. Not price.

Not quite. In fiat terms it would be quantitative easing. You print more money but value doesn’t change. You’re just entering it into the system at the same value. 
This is different in that each coin will hold the same combined value initially. Then as it’s individual value increases you make gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:58:17
9k is the limit for suspicious transactions to be reported. On second thought I think that’s cash. 
The blockchain should prove when you bought it and show the gains as increase in value as opposed to obtaining large sums of money. 
The alternative would be to spend it on a reasonably liquid   asset and sell that asset. 
All depends how far back the audit trail needs to go. If you used an exchange you should have a statement of account available

Managed to trade LTC a couple times to get some free coins but nothing on the other two.

No. Huge back logs on transactions. Reported days or delays. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:36:38
I know this isn’t the answer you probably want but I think the safest option is to drop feed sums under 9k into your account over a period of time. 
Big fees I know. 
Can you not use your keys to research the block chain? I suppose the point of BTC is that it’s an open ledger. Your transaction(s) will be recorded with a time and date to prove the growths.

A hard fork only increase the distribution of the coin. The value of those coin is dependent on the market. It is likely that the actually market cap remains similar as the original
Coin tends to drop while the new coin gains a new value. 
If you have $1 and you trade it for 2 x 50c you still have $1 but more coins. 
It’s no inflation. 
Both are then free to be valued at whatever the market decide
