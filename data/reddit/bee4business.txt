Dude, what the hell are you rambling on about? :) Wouldn't admit that you were right about what?
@_date: 2018-06-21 18:58:46
I second this question.
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:02:00
Ok, guys, thanks for your answers. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 18:18:13
What did you mean with "what's next"? Do you want to know if I have another question?

I've been wanting to move my BTC from a legacy address paper wallet to a Segwit paper wallet. Can anyone tell me if segwitaddress.org is safe to use (to generate the keys)?
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:48:24
Ok, thanks!

Not if I kill myself first.

Hello, fellow hodlers. I've been wanting to move my funds from a legacy address paper wallet to a Segwit one. Is segwitaddress.org safe to use in order to generate the keys? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the process would be: generate SW keys, sweep legacy keys to Electrum SW wallet and finally send funds to SW paper wallet. Is this right? 
I'm told tx fees are quite low at the moment, is this true?
Also, could someone explain to me what is a Bech32 address, and if I should use it (advantages/disadvantages). 
Thanks a lot!

It's ok, don't berate yourself over it, but learn this lesson and take it with you to the next dip.If it was money you could afford to lose why would you sell at a loss?

Could someone help me out with a question I have? I'm trying to transfer my BTC from a legacy address paper wallet to a segwit paper wallet. I am planning to generate a new segwit wallet in Electrum while being offline, exporting this wallets public and private keys and deleting the wallet file. Then I'll sweep the private key of the old paper wallet into Electrum and send my funds to the offline generated segwit public key. Am I thinking correctly?
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:41:31
Thanks for your reply. I want to use a paper wallet for cold storage. Can I use Electrum to generate the keys to do so?

Thanks ;)

Hi, guys and gals. Can someone tell me if it is, like, SUPER hard for an average PC user to set up a Lightning node? Does the node earn Bitcoin/is it profitable? Thanks.

You should convert your nipples into BTC.
