It only looks like a spaghetti mess to humans that are not good at comprehending many bits of data at once. Computers are good at it. The internet works on a similar world wide 'web' of connections between devices. Channels are maintained by the parties involved not by the entire system. This essentially means there are no limits to the network apart from the bandwidth between the routed channels. 
A sudden closing of a large hub would cause an influx of on-chain transactions that could take a while for miners to process. But the money would be safe. As far as I understand.

I dont support tether at all and hope it does disappear. I just haven't seen any actual evidence that it doesn't do what it says it does.You would expect a USD pegged crypto to see high demand when prices are going up (for the whales getting in) and when prices are crashing (for those that want to sell out temporarily without triggering a tax event). What would be weird is if you were running a scam, had to go to court to defend yourself, then committed another major fraud a few weeks before you went.

As price goes up the miner reward is worth more so there is more incentive for people to start mining and hence the hashrate goes up.
@_date: 2019-07-11 06:28:04
High hashrate doesn't make your transactions go through any faster. Difficulty just goes up.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:58:00
It is very likely to change date due to changes in hash rate or even just due to probability.
The difficulty adjustment only happens every 2 weeks (roughly) so the block count can easily get ahead/behind of the predicted schedule.

I think an assumption that everyone has an average of 2 addresses would not be accurate. There are many many addresses which have tiny dust amounts left over from transactions.

Yes it would. These spikes only last for a few days when there is a lot of price movement and people are trying to get in and out of exchanges. Take  a look at the mempool history. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:40:08
Keep in mind that most exchanges where you can sell or trade large amounts of bitcoin will require at least 6 block confirmations. So to do this double spend attack you would need to mine at least 6 blocks in a row. This is extremely unlikely even if you do own more than 50% of the mining power. 
You would also need to be very very highly invested in bitcoin mining equipment and electricity (probably in the order of billions of dollars). If you were able to successfully pull off a 51% attack this would cause the bitcoin price to fall very dramatically. It just doesn't make economic sense to attack a system you are that invested in when you could make a killing from just mining. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:01:23
I think a 2mb hardfork would be difficult after the S2X drama. Even if it was supported by core (and not a malicious take over attempt). 
Does anyone know if this could be done as a soft fork? I heard BCH are looking at a 32mb blocksize change as a soft fork (no idea why I guess they just really like their big blocks). 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:24:50
I can confirm that I did a 50c transaction a couple weeks ago and it went through in less than an hour. Right now a transaction like that looks like it would take a couple days (just depends on if the pile up continues or dies down). 
This site shows you how quickly each transaction has gone through based on how much of a fee was paid (in Satoshis per byte). Most transactions are about 200 to 300 bytes I think. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:08:36
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:33:26
No. There will just be a backlog. Bitcoin isn't like a webserver. As long as there is someone in the world that can mine they will happily take your fees and process transaction. Fortunately there are lots of those people.

It's all open source code. There are a bunch of people around the world that are interested in developing it. The main group is called bitcoin core. I believe they work on it for free (or donations). If someone wants to make a change they can develop it and present it to all the nodes and miners and users for review. If it gets enough consensus then it can be implemented as a soft fork or hard fork. Exchangers and wallet providers then integrate it if they want to. 
The most promising scaling solutions are additional layers to the blockchain (see lightning network). These won't interfere with the main chain at all so anyone can develop it and people will use it if it's good.

I tend to agreed about 2mb, even if it was just temporary untill lightning is up and running. 
As of yet I have not seen any other crypto that I would trust to run a global economy of trillions. Those that claim they can scale have not been put to the test like bitcoin has. Those that can genuinely scale have made compromises on security or centralisation. In my opinion security and decentralised are the most important foundational attributes. 
It's early days. A huge amount  of smart people have just recently started working in this field and I'm confident we can go from dial up to fibre broadband in much less time than the internet took.

@_date: 2017-12-14 11:30:57
Lightning may result in large hubs but that is not the same as centralisation. These hubs can only play by the rules or risk a penalty. And if they try something shady the community can just choose to route around them. They have no power over the system so there is no centralisation. My guess is there will be plenty of channels happy to process transactions for free (in the same way that many are happy to run a node at their own cost).

If lightning becomes popular I could easily see it taking 95% of on chain transactions off chain. Which means the on chain ones would be much less congested and much cheaper. 
Lightning is good for smaller payments. Payment size would be restricted by the amount that each person has in reserves. However as they are instant and cheap, I don't see why you couldn't make large payments by combining multiple smaller lightning transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:52:11
The energy use is not directly related to the number of transactions. Its related to the mining difficulty, which increases with more mining competition. If the number of transactions doubled tomorrow (which it can't do currently due to other scaling issues) the energy usage and security of the network would be the same. Lightning network could achieve this.
Alot of energy is expended by the current financial system and by mining of other metals and commodities. Alot of energy is expended by Christmas lights. The cost of renewable energy production is falling rapidly and will very soon overtake traditional power plants. 
Proof of stake (in its current form) is not an ideal solution for bitcoin as security is very critical.

LN will be here next year. In a market that is moving this quickly 3+ years would kill bitcoin. We are hitting the start of the s curve now, if it becomes unusable because of backlogged transactions attention will go elsewhere. 
Im happy to leave this problem to the devs that understand the technical side. But it is a problem. If segwit is the best and most immediate solution than we need to be getting alot more serious about increasing adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:57:16

1. Stored using cryptographic keys (same as bitcoin base layer). Very secure as long as you keep your keys safely. 
2. They will receive the bitcoin immediately. Buts it's kind of like an IOU (but very secure and spendable to others). they can spend the same bitcoin IOU immediately. In theory you could stay on the lightning network for months or even years. 
3. I don't know but I have heard it can run on a normal CPU and uses small computing power. See 'eclair' and you can setup a channel on the testnet if you want to try it out (I have not done it but keen to give it a try). 
4. Closing a channel cost the same as an on chain bitcoin transaction. If your not in a hurry this should be a few dollars. 
5. I don't know. 
6. It can be used for one off transactions as long as there is a route between you and that person. In theory a network would form similar to the internet where everyone can connect to everyone else by routing traffic.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:31:29
Not quite. 
A 51% attack does not give you the value of the all transactions in that block. With a 51% attack you could double spend your own transactions. For instance you buy something with bitcoin, then re-do the work of mining that block and create an alternative blockchain without that transaction in it. You would have to keep this up to maintain your blockchain as the longest chain. There is no way to 'steal' other transactions which are directed to other addresses.
Therefore the energy required to keep the blockchain secure has nothing to do with the amount or total value of transactions in each block. 
However, as the value of bitcoin goes up, there is more incentive to mine which means there is more mining competition and therefore more energy used. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:42:10

It would not get to that stage. Bitcoin core have said they will go to a bigger block size if and when needed.

I agree that satoshi has a right to privacy and to do what he wants with the Bitcoin that he mined legitimately. if anyone has rights to a million Bitcoin it's him.
However.. I'd also consider him one of the biggest liabilities to Bitcoin. He ownes the keys to what may [soon] be the single biggest pile of wealth in the world. That's a lot of power for someone that the world knows almost nothing about. Even if he has good intentions, a decendant that gets the keys may not be.

 Bitcoin has gained more hashrate in the last week than the sum total hashrate of all other SHA-256 POW chains (Including Bitcoin cash).

That spike alone is twice the entire hashrate of BCH. Meaning someone chose not to destroy that chain with a 51% attack.

Yes that's called inflation of the supply. Only on a much smaller scale than the US that has printed trillions over the last few years.
The math is simple. I'll teach you. 
$1m per coin x 21 million final supply (including the millions of btc that has been lost).
= 21 trillion dollar market cap.
That's less than 1/3 of the global broad money supply.
It's better than Fiat because you can own and store it yourself, transfer it without permission, and it doesn't get diluted to nothing by the federal reserve. With a bit more development it will be near free and instant to transfer. 
Ok just to be reasonable for a second. Im not one of those guys that convinced Bitcoin is definitely going over a million. But unless some major powers interfere I see a small chance that it goes way way higher than what it is now. And for me that's enough to put a bit of money in.

The game has changed since bcash. You could now 51% attack BCH, take your double spend, while shorting BCH on an exchange at high leverage. Then just switch your miners over to BTC and continue to make use of your mining hardware investment.

The difficulty adjustment only happens every 2016 blocks. Any increase in hashrate before the adjustment means the average blocktime is less than 10min.
On average we mine blocks around 6 to 10% faster than designed because of the continuous increase in hashpower.
If hashpower starts decreasing it will correct in the other direction. However it's more likely that hashpower will be added rather than removed over the next couple years.

Sure, I agree that the little guys can't mine independantly.
But there is no issue switching pools. Bitmain is running [BTC.com]( and Antpool. This makes up just 33% of the total haspower. [
Even if he covertly controls some of the other anonymous pools, there are plenty others to switch too.
I'm sure he owns alot of hardware himself. But this is very very far from 51% hashpower.
Also the bcash mining drama cannot be entirely attributed to bitmain. It was in all miners interest to game the difficulty like that. Of course they were going to switch to the most profitable chain.
I feel like you critizied me, then kind of agreed with what I said but just said some more words anyway.

I think the current ICOs and 99% of alt coins will go to near zero. Same as the internet bubble. So unless their creaters cash out before the masses work out it was all hype then they're gonna get hurt too. 
But some crypto will survive. The world wants a global currency, so far the best contender is bitcoin.
There is no figure head. Higher liquidity (a requirement  for institutional investors), and has a decent scaling solution (lightning). Obviously the price will get out of hand and need corrections along the way.  But over the next few years it's gonna keep trending up as it has over the last 8 years. Imo.
Do as you wish.

I believe there are two things. Firstly you put in your security deposit, then if your order gets filled all the Bitcoin in your order also gets locked in a multisig escrow account until the buyer pays up. 
If someone tries to break the rules an arbitror determines where the locked money goes, and the dishonest party might also loose their security deposit as a penalty.

Reasonable regulation would probably help Bitcoin because it gives developers and instutional investors some certainty and direction. 
If they were to ban it (possible but unlikely) they could hurt the price and adoption but would not stop it from being used. Bitcoin network cannot be shut down without turning off the entire internet indefinitely (and even then there are other ways of doing transactions peer to peer). There are even decentralized exchanges now that allow buying and selling into dollars anonymously. These exchanges are also distributed and can not be shut down. 
There are no middle men. Regulators don't act as middle men. At worst they just make it slightly less convinent to buy bitcoin. but they certainly don't make extra fees. 
I find it unlikely that big governments would create a total ban. They can see that it would be ineffective (in same way that they can't shut down torrenting) and they would be seen as hindering tech growth and killing jobs. Plus there are too many people in high places that hold this stuff.

It runs on distributed open software rather than from a server. Once it's out there is no way to shut it down. There is also no middle men that hold your Bitcoin for you.
The only con I can see is that you need a security deposit to conduct a trade. This is a little bit of Bitcoin that gets locked up during the process and discourages breaking the rules or spamming the network. The deposit is returned after the trade is finalised. When other development progresses (such as atomic swaps) this might not be required in the future.

I'm interested to know if you got this from anywhere or if its just a guess?
The median transaction value on chain is around $100 at the moment. That means that if all transactions less than $100 were done off chain we could get a 2x capacity increase. Except that you still have lots of channel opening and closing transactions, so lets say 1.5x.
To get a 4x LN would need to handle much higher transaction sizes. It seems unlikely as I don't think everyone would be keen to hold that much in a hot wallet, and it doesn't make sense to drain your channels with big LN payments and then have to top them up again with onchain transactions.

You don't need a full node. That's a common missunderstanding. 
Bitcoin light wallet is non-custodial. You control the keys.
Bluewallet is much easier to use but is custodial. You are trusting the owner to not steal your money. Good thing is that it's open source and the the owners ID is known (so you can take him to court if he takes your money).

I realize you are just here to criticize, but for others;
Segwit and batching is making more capacity and keeping fees low. The network is currently handling around [300,000]( transactions per day, which would have (and did) congest the mempool in dec 2017. Yet i'm still using 1sat/b on all my transactions and thats with segwit adoption at just 45%. Seems like its helping alot.
As my posts suggest, i believe that on the next bull run we will have full blocks again and fees will go up again. I see two options;
1. Increase the blocksize now. This would be solve the immediate scaling problem but at the cost of decentralization and hardfork risk. Then what? Merchants and exchanges will do what requires the least effort and will continue with inefficient use of blockspace until another blocksize increase is needed. This unnecessarily bloats the blockchain cutting off more and more people from being able to participate by mining and making it more profitable for mining cartels. It already takes 17GB/day of bandwith to run a node, how many less people will be mining when you have 100MB+ blocks with 1700GB/day bandwith (ignoring propagation issues)? We all know where this leads because we have seen it play out in BCH  - where 2 rich individuals have shown they they have access to enough mining power to take over (good thing one of them is 'nice'). Do you think a global currency like this would survive a major war or attack from a nation state?
2. First build technology that doesn't make compromises on the base layer. If fees go up, merchants and users will start putting in the effort adopt these technologies. Build sound money first and people then people will use it. It can't be done the other way around. The technology is getting better and i believe LN will get to a point where most users don't even know they are using it (because it runs in a wallet backend). In worst case scenario we can always fall back on an easy blocksize increase.

Its a tipping service that lets you send bitcoin on the lightning network (LN) to other reddit users.
LN is a new protocol layer built on top of bitcoin that allows users to trustlessly send bitcoin for near free and instantly (instead of waiting for blocks to be mined). The downside is that its new and a little more complicated to setup and use. Its only designed to be used for small payments (around $100 or less)
I've sent you 1000 satoshi which isn't much. you can keep it on reddit and use it to tip others if you like. If you would like to withdraw it off reddit you could use a Lightning wallet like [bluewallet]( (which is very easy to use but is custodial). If you want avoid custodial wallets try [this](

It's likely the pattern would continue. It makes sense that the amount of activity would die off through the night in America. If Bitcoin becomes much more popular in a country with a different time zone than this would start to change things. It could also change if there is a big event, such as a fork or sudden change in price.
If/when blocks become fuller the backlogs will get bigger and mempool might not empty. which means fees go up.

A few things to mention.
1. You don't need to wait for these times to do a bitcoin transaction. Use a wallet that lets you set the fee amount, if the transaction is not urgent simply set a low fee (even 1sat/byte will do) and it will clear as soon as the backlog dies out.
2. This is just based on mempool over the last week. You can check at any time if there is a backlog by going to [

Liquid is certainly far more centralized than Bitcoin. But it is intended to get used by centralized exchanges. If you have no issues having your Bitcoin on an exchange then you shouldn't have issues with your exchange using liquid to transfer your Bitcoin to another centralized exchange. It certainly seems better than using tether and having the additional friction of USDT to BTC exchanges (with fees) on either end.
Will be interesting to see how much load this takes off the main blockchain. I wouldn't often send bitcoin from one exchange directly to another but I suppose there may be others that do.

Yes, a newb wallet should automatically have its own watchtowers which protects its users.
However this service is not very likely to be used often. Its unlikely for mobile phones to be offline for long periods of time. Also watchtowers are only needed if you are going to be receiving payments. If you are just spending then previous states are always in your favor. Most everyday users would only be spending with their lighting channels. This is pretty normal for most people who are used to getting paid into a saving account, then transferring to their spending account which is linked to their debit card.

LN needs an app for newbs. It should auto fund a channel as soon as you send bitcoin there. Or at the tap of a button. Most users don't need to know which node they are connected to, just let the app choose a few nodes that have decent capacity and improves decentralization. 
We should have on-chain + lighting QR codes in one. The app can decide if it can make a lightning payment or if an onchain payment is needed.

Other than them acquiring bitcoin to hold in cold storage (likely OTC), BAKKT will be all off-chain transactions.
If people are willing to trust them with custody than this is not such a bad thing for the rest of us as it keeps trading traffic from congesting up the mempool.
Who cares about proving the transactions are increasing. This metric is not reliable because other improvements such as batching and lightning will also come into play.

The transaction was only 0.8316 BTC ($5600.00).

Edit: it is possible that its the other way around but very unlikely.
Edit 2: The 30k BTC originally came from a bitfinex cold wallet (sent last month). Its possible bitfinex also owns the 30k BTC address and they may be dipping into it due to the tether scare (lots of people withdrawing from bitfinex). Complete speculation of course.

I don't think the argument really has anything to do with whole number bias. 
The only reason one Bitcoin is refered to (rather than 1mbit or 1 Satoshi) is because that's how we measure the price of Bitcoin. One Bitcoin = $6500.
To me this post is simply helping with price discovery. It's difficult to estimate the true value of something like bitcoin. It helps to imagine how much a certain group of people would pay for some Bitcoin. If a group of fidelity investment clients would want more than $6500 worth of Bitcoin in their portfolio than it's likely that the price of one Bitcoin will be higher than what it is today. 
It should really be compared with the amount of new bitcoin that is being minned rather than the total circulating supply.

Maybe bitmain is actually gearing up to attack Bitcoin.
-Put all new hashpower into Bitcoin to raise the difficulty and drive out other miners.
-Suddenly switch all hashpower over to BCH.
-Bitcoin network stalls (death spiral)
-At this point he could also try a 51% attack. But this doesn't make much sense. Other miners will jump in for the high fees. And it's hard to do a double spend when blocks aren't going through.
This is why miner centralization is the biggest risk to Bitcoin. And why big blocks are a bad idea.

I believe they are actually going to zero (clearing the mempool). 
Some miners will refuse to include transactions that are less than a certain fee (usually less than 1 sat/byte) even if they have space to include it. So some of these ones might remain but they would represent a very small percentage. 
Those green transactions are getting processed. It's possibly just that there are new transactions coming in immediately after the block was mined, which makes it look like some didn't go through.

Glad you choose the two most important data points there.
Assuming you are getting your data from the same chart as me, this is the probability of success between any two random nodes.

None of these guys are trying to use LN to pay $300 lightning payments and there is no need to route through them.

Although there are of course risks there are also some benefits to holding alot of Bitcoin on exchanges like bitfinex. One of them is that bitfinex allows you to use this money for 'funding' (other users borrow your Bitcoin for leveraging) which means your Bitcoin can earn interest. With this amount of Bitcoin the interest would be heaps. I think it's at least 0.05% per day.

Every time a block is mined, the miner puts as many transactions into his block as possible (there is limited space). He chooses the transactions with the highest fees to put into his block because they get paid to him. However, if there is no backlog of transactions and he can fit them all into a block (which is currently the case) then it doesn't matter if you pay a big fee or a little fee, your transaction will still get included. 
This chart is showing the transactions that are waiting to get into a block (called mempool). They are sorted in color by the amount of fee that they have attached to them. The pile of transactions slowly increases as transactions are being added to the mempool, then suddenly drops where a miner has found a block and included those transactions (they get removed from the mempool). 
If the drops are going right down to 0 it means that the mempool is getting emptied every block (therefore you can choose a cheap transaction fee). 
If the mountains are building up and not dropping all the way to the bottom it means that not all transactions are fitting into the blocks and you might need to pay a higher fee to get your transaction into the next block. For example If they are only dropping down to the 10 sat/byte range then you should choose a fee of at least 10 sat/byte if you want your transaction to go through quickly. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 02:46:23
Fair point. 
I guess as long as you had a small bit of anonymous Bitcoin (bought with cash or decentralized exchange, or shape shited through xmr) you could still use it to open a channel then wash your other Bitcoin then close it again.

Sorry last one had a typo
@_date: 2018-06-18 06:08:39
Not sure exactly what you mean.
Blocks get mined roughly every 10 min, this has nothing to do with the number of transactions or fees that are in the mempool. To mine a block a computer has to guess a number that will get the correct solution to a math problem. The computers (globally) are guessing over 40000000000000000000 numbers per second in a race to win the number guessing lottery. 
As soon as someone guesses the correct number they get to grab all the transactions in the mempool that they can include, put it in a block, and broadcast that to the other nodes with proof that they guessed the correct number. All the other nodes then agree that those transactions are valid and go on to mine the next block. 
If you pay 1000sat/byte and I pay 1 sat/byte then both our transactions will go through in the same time (next block) as long as the mempool is empty and the miner chooses to include both. 
If the miner can't fit all the transactions in, its likely that yours will go though but mine will not. Mine will simply stay in the mempool until the backlog dies does again and it fits into a block. 
It's handy to know how full the mempool is so that you can choose a fee that will go through quickly but not overpay. Usually your wallet/exchange check and calculates this for you but often they still overpay. 
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:28:33
It doesn't require trust. When you open a channel both parties agree to a set of rules between them. If one party breaks any of those roles the channel automatically closes, pushing the funds to the correct person and penalising the dishonest person. 
There is a possibility of someone broadcasting an old state to the network. This could mean you could loose funds if..
- you had previously received funds from the attacker. 
- your node was offline the entire timelock period (the amount of time is agreed on when setting up the channel and could be mutiple weeks/months). The attacker is not able to see if your node is offline or not so would be taking a huge risk as he would get penalized if you catch them.
- you didnt have a watchtower service watching your channel.
So in summary if you manage your channels correctly there is no trust needed at all. Similar to how you also need to manage a Bitcoin node properly and keep your keys safe.
@_date: 2019-10-02 04:28:39

I  used to think I was a good trader until I started tracking my holdings over time against BTC. I think people are normally biased to the occasional 'wins' and so they feel they are doing well. Especially if you are just looking at USD values.   
Back to hodling I guess.
@_date: 2018-06-07 06:31:37
Agreed. 
Also. The attacker is creating a fork of bitcoin and is broadcasting the new chain to nodes for validation. The nodes would accept it only because it's the longest chain. However, once people have worked out what is going on, there is no reason the other nodes can't simply ignore this fork and continue on with the valid chain making the other one worthless.

I was looking at this myself. 
Its calculated based on how far your price is from market value. If you sell 1btc at 1&amp; over market value the total fee is 0.2&amp; (or 0.002btc). 
Then you also have to pay transaction fees. 
Trade volume is low because its fairly new and still rather difficult to setup. 
I'd expect it to pickup after time. This service is still way better than [localbitcoins.com]( (which now requires ID). So I expect it to eventually take most of that trade volume.

Luke has been an advocate for reducing the blocksize for some time now.
This code is not yet merged. It would need to reach some consensus among devs first.
As its a soft fork it would also need to reach a level of census among mining nodes. I would suggest its unlikely to get traction. However some miners may have some incentive as transaction fees would very likely increase (significantly).
Personally I do not support this rule change. But i'm interested to have a discussion on it.
Looks like this would be a temporary soft fork (august 1st to Dec 31)

Try out the [bitcoin lightning ]( Unlike bluewallet this is non-custodial so you control your keys and channels. 
You will need to open channels manually and if you want to receive bitcoin you will need to free up some incoming capacity. Hint: After you open your channel use [ to send bitcoin back to your BTC wallet. This creates space in your LN channel for receiving. Or you could just spend it to free up space.

Im not really satisfied with his answer to the routing question. Routing is working now, with a small network but even the lead devs admit that this strategy would not work with a really really large network as it would be very computationally intensive to keep track of the whole network. Its a problem that we have years to solve but it would have been great if he went into some of the proposals including ant routing and neighborhood broadcasters etc.

Are there still prices for some coins one the portfolio tab? 
Coinmarketcap did change their API however it still seems to be working for the top 100 coins. Anything under rank 100 will not get price data.
I've also noticed that the Historical price data for BTC is missing a few dates (about 4 days over the last few months are missing). which causes errors on the moon math tab (which is also shown on the portfolio tab). I've been fixing this by manually filling in the gaps.  The historical price data does not come from coinmarketcap. I think its coindesk or quandl.

AMP is going to be a huge improvement on lightning. It effectively eliminates all capacity issues and lets much larger payments go through. Given that an onchain transaction costs about \~300 satoshi at best, and most lightning payments cost around 2 satoshi, this would mean you could break up a payment 150 times before its more expensive on lightning than on chain. Given $50 payments are going through very consistently now, that would mean payments up to $7500 are still cheaper on lightning than on chain (though not recommended obviously).
This also means there is much less of an advantage to have high capacity nodes (hubs) and really comes down to who has the lowest routing fees (many are even free). This should help prevent the network from becoming a 'hub and spoke' topography.

GDAX doesn't use tethers. 
'Moving' Tethers into bitcoin is the same as buying bitcoin with tether. The exchange that you used to buy it with would see the price pump ahead of the others. 
Agreed that transparency is good. But If I went to facebook and asked to see their books because i suspected fraud, but didnt have any actual evidence then i would get laughed out of the room. 
As my posts suggest i dont support tethers in anyway. The claim I am refuting is that the price of bitcoin isn't propped up by tethers. There is no evidence that tethers are used to manipulate the price and yet we get comments like yours. I think that fabricated FUD is a much more real and effective market manipulation strategy. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 00:29:08
This uses extension blocks (which also allows bigger blocks by softfork). My understanding is that the BTC devs are not all keen on extension blocks (at least back when the idea was originally proposed).

Agreed. But if they are printing it out of nothing (which is conjecture) they can only do that once per coin. So once its in the system there is no benefit in manipulating the price with USDT rather than any other currency or crypto.

I saw some basic napkin maths a while back that indicated that the current source routing algorithms should be right for up to 500k to 1ml LN nodes.

The idea is that it will have a seperate little chip on board just for keeping keys and signatures. Other apps will not be able to read or write to this, only Samsung. So it should be alot more secure. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 09:31:51


Ah so it 'writes' data to the chip and then 'reads' the signed data then. Got it. 
I think what you are trying to say is that Samsung will not be able to steel your keys. Assuming they make it in a way that stops themselves. Which would be good. 
Even if someone can't get the keys themselves they could potentially get the chip to sign a transaction that sends the Bitcoin to an address they control. Unless the phone has a physical button that has to be pressed (which I doubt) to sign a transaction then this is entirely possible. The article I read said that the chip would only talk directly to samsung and nothing else. Thus preventing malware software from doing any damage.

The more nodes the more complicated the path and the more information you need to know. Its alot to ask for a mobile app to check on 1mil nodes, with several channels each and know which channel has enough capacity etc (which is continually changing). It needs to do this very quickly. Once it has the data the route calculation is relatively simple. 'Recommended' hubs are not ideal as that would make the network less decentralized. the big hubs could start jacking up fees or censoring transactions and the everyday user would still use them, unless the app knew better paths (again this requires a lot of information). A third party server could certainly keep track of the network state and send the route to you. But again this would be centralized. The server might be sending all transactions through their own route or deliberately avoiding certain people. 
The idea would be to have each person able to know the network state themselves. Or at least for there to be many broadcasters (like watchtower services) that can be checked against each other so that the naughty ones can be called out. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:42:04
I think bitfinex always charge 0.005 as a fixed rate. 
This site shows how quickly each transaction clears based on the fee paid. 
Unfortunately alot of wallets and exchanges don't let you choose a custom fee and they will just use a calculated rate (which over pays the fee in most cases).

90% crash is extremely unlikely. It would require a much bigger force than an exchange going under to cause a crash like that. 
Mt Gox caused a 75% crash but they were managing 70% of all bitcoin transactions at the time. Bitfinex trade volume is only 10% of total BTC market volume.

There are two other independent implementations on lightning protocol that are not related to blockstream at all. The code is completely open source.
There is almost no money in it for blockstream. The cost of running a LN node is tiny and blockstream have absolutely no advantage to any one else in this. 
if you are suggesting they are just out to kill Bitcoin completely that is equally absurd. Many of these guys are Bitcoin OGs. They know the tech well and they are heavily invested in seeing Bitcoin succeed. They wouldn't be easily fooled by some banker investor. Also it would be a stupid tactic as it's pretty obvious that another crypto would take its place and equally threaten the banks. 
Second layer solutions have been talked about since near the beginning of Bitcoin. Even by Satoshi himself. This is not a new idea that blockstream invented. It's been heavily researched and there are plenty of smart people on both sides of the debate. Waaay more than are under the control of blockstream.
There will always be medium to high value transactions happening on the base layer and giving miners fees. Ln is just opening up small and micro payments which is a new use case that hardley is used on the main chain anyway. Taking a percentage of the fees away from miners is arguably better than letting miners form centralized server farm cartels due to high blocksize. Where security would be completely lost. I believe miners centralisation is way bigger problem than miners loosing some transactions fees. Did you know bch miners get less than $1 per block for transaction fees. In btc it's over $400. Big blocks aren't helping. Hardley worth fighting for. 
If you really want to look for a conspiracy look into bitmains segwit boost advantage and why he apposed segwit. There is billions of dollars in that. Follow the money.

The allegations that the bitcoin market is propped up by $0.6B tethers is completely baseless and designed to create FUD. The 24hr BTC trade volume is over 5x higher than the entire amount of tethers in circulation. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:32:55
My understanding is that the device is physically unable to transfer that kind of information. It can only sign a transaction that the app sends to it. Signing of a transaction doesn't in any way reveal the private keys, it's only a mathematical proof that you do own the keys. The equation cannot be calculated backwards to determine how it was proved. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:01:50
This is good news... 
no real money was stolen because it was blacklisted and can't be sold. If it was taken directly from Tether then no person/exchange actually lost anything of value. Tether could just replace the tokens with fresh ones. 
No one will trust tether anymore which will mean exchanges will need to go back to holding real dollars instead of USDT. Demand for bitcoin will continue to go up proving that its not propped up by tethers and thus removing the FUD. 
Tethers are easy to print and hard to audit. This goes against the purpose of bitcoin and therefore shouldn't be part of the crypto space. Hopefully this is where they end - after paying out their tokens.

Yes that is true. But the entire market cap of USDT is less than 20% of the 24hr BTC volume. Even if one person dumped all existing tether into bitcoin on one day they couldn't do much more than a short term pump. They would also have to be paying a much higher price than the rest of the market was selling at before hand. To sustain an inflation for this long you would have to keep pumping it in.
Case in point; Bitcoin cash.

Could you explain this further. The github says "each of the participants enters and leaves the Typhon sidechain with a much simple P2WSH/P2SH transaction with only one output". 
This sounds to me like each participate still needs to do an onchain transaction to get in and out of the sidechain (though I take it that these single output transactions are much smaller).

Bitfinex allows margin trading of up to 3.3x leverage. To do this you need to hold USD as equity. You can't 'repeat over and over'. 
For example; if you bought 1 bitcoin at $800 last year and its now worth $8000. You made $7200 but you still have the same amount of bitcoin. You can't convert back to USD to buy more bitcoin because you just sold it. Margin trading (which is essentially just taking a loan from the exchange) doesn't help this either.
Sure you can [somewhat] manipulate the market with enough money. My point is you can't prop up a $130B market by feeding in $0.6B over a 1month+ duration.

Please explain how lightning resembles a central bank in any way? It is 100% decentralised. If mainstream channels pop up the users will be able to choose a channel route that doesn't use them. That means that even if a super channel forms it has no power over the network.

To hold money in a lightning channel you essentially have to keep your node online. Which means you are more susceptible to hacking etc. If your node goes offline for longer than the timelock period (which can be set to whatever you like) than someone could broadcast an older state and steel your money (only if you have received money from them in the past). Though there are 'watchtower' services coming out soon which will help deal with this. 
Also just because lightning is a lot newer so there is a much higher chance of there being bugs.
Personally i wouldn't feel comfortable putting any more than a couple hundred dollars on there at once.

Ok. thanks for improving my argument.

I'd say its perfectly valid for me to say that I have previously read something without spending hours to dig it up in an effort to help you do research. You are welcome to research it if you wish or to dismiss it. 
The link I did provided backed my point up quite well. Though Andreas is not a lightning Dev he is considered an expert and understands the technical issues well. certainly better than me. Network communications is his background.
I'm not saying that the myth that lightning can't scale is true. But I don't think your answer would satisfy the Bitcoin cashers or even address their myths. post your video on r/btc and you will see what I mean. I'm on your side just be prepared to give an educated answer that's all.

I can't tell If you are trolling or just stupid. 
Lightning hubs settle on the blockchain. If they don't they can be forced to. They can only play by the rules or loose money. Nothing like a bank. And it doesn't rely on litecoin or any other altcoins. 
During the last crash fees went up 500%. Bitcoin price fell 20%. Fees in fiat were way higher than normal. Maybe look at some number before you go sprouting baseless claims. 
Edit: correction

Think about it.. Bitfinex was behind GDAX by $100 to $200 during whole the rally. To pump the price with tethers you need to buy at above market rates. I know this because I was watching the markets. for proof compare:  and  at the same time stamps. 
Also... The total bitcoin volume traded in the last 24 hours is 8.5x more than the ENTIRE tether market cap. Those tethers were fed into the system over 3 months. That averages to only 0.001% of the 24hour bitcoin volume. To be fair, you can get some advantage with leverage (3x on bitfinex) and by dumping all at once etc but you are still not even close to having a significant impact against a market that big.

Market will buy immediately at the best price it can get. 
Limit will buy or sell at the price you set. Market will have to move to that price for the order to be filled. This only works if you want to buy at less than the current market price, or sell at more than the current price (otherwise the order will just fill immediately). 
Stop order will trigger a buy or sell if that value is reached only. So you could sell if the price falls to $X. Or buy if the price goes over x dollars.

First he argues that bcash will beat bitcoin in the long run because it's cheaper and faster. 
Then, when asked how it's better than litecoin, he argues that it has better utility adoption and higher trade volume than those altcoins. 
Which one is it Roger? If it's about trade volume and adoption then bitcoin wins over everything. If it's about fees and speed, then litecoin or dash is gonna win. Bcash has no advantage.

You don't have to have a channel open with bitfinex. You can have a channel open with anyone on the network and use it to route payments to bitfinex or any other users on the network provided there is good capacity in the nodes along the path.
If you intend to use bitfinex alot it would make sense to have a direct channel with them to reduce fees and any potential capacity issues.

Congrats man.

@_date: 2019-02-07 01:25:01
Agree. Only problem is that lazy people might only have one channel connected to a large 'hub'. Which they would know and could jack up their fees etc. I guess in the worst case you could also say that a handful of hubs appear with significantly greater capacity than anyone else. Then they also have some control over larger size payments as people could be forced to use one of the big hubs otherwise the route fails. - Hench why AMP is going to destroy that criticism.

Seems like these tethers are just the next FUD getting pushed. 
I'm not saying there's no shady stuff going on but.. 
1. There is currently only only $0.6B of tethers in existence (this will keep rising). This is tiny compared to bitcoins market cap. It would be very hard to inflate the price with such a small amount. If tethers suddenly become worthless this would be a small dip in the bitcoin market (assuming people act rationally). 
2. This is only a risk if the exchanges are lying and not actually holding equal amounts of dollars to back their tethers. They claim to have been audited but this could be hard to prove. 
3. There is a correlation between the trade volume of bitcoin and tethers. That doesn't mean causation. It's much easier to trade btc to tethers because this is easier to transfer between exchanges. So it makes sense that the volume of tethers would increase as bitcoin volume increases not the other way around.
4. Tethers are used for other cryptos too. So this isn't just  a problem with bitcoin as many seem to be claiming. 
5. Worst case scenario is a big exchange like Bitfinex goes down. This would be bad and would cause a decent sized impact to the market. But not even close to the magnitude of the Mt gox crash. There are a lot of other exchanges (that don't use tethers) around these days and even decentralised exchanges. I could see a Max 40% dip, taking extreme FUD into account. 
That said.. I don't like the idea of tethers at all. It is easy to print and hard to audit. The whole idea of bitcoin was to stop this sort of thing. We should try and stop this before it gets big enough to cause a problem.

my bet is that BSV will not be worth much. The price will start to crash just after the fork date making it less profitable by the time you sell them off. 
A simpler way to profit would be to just short BCH on the 14th. Maybe CSW will pull off a 51% attack on BCH (to try and make his coin succeed). Then things will really crash.

Great work man. I believe your nodes have contributed massively to the liquidity on LN and has helped accelerate LN adoption.
I expect $5.74 per month does not cover the running costs of your nodes. Do you plan to keep them online for the near future? Do you plan to raise fees to become profitable?
It feels like most lightning nodes are operating simply out of an interest in the technology rather than a financial incentive. Hopefully it becomes much more profitable as adoption increases and there are more transactions going through the network.

Nothing is visable on the blockchain except for your initial channel opening (and closing If you choose to do that). No one on the outside would even know a transaction took place. However there are ways to provide a proof.
Lightning payments are just signed Bitcoin Transactions that aren't broadcast to the network. Think of it like as if you put 1btc on a paper wallet and physically gave it to a friend. A transaction happened but nothing was recorded on the blockchain. Lightning does that but in a way that doesn't require you to know or trust the other person. 
The payments have value because you could choose to broadcast them at any point and claim the BTC. It's like how most civil disputes settle outside of court. The court system would never be able to  manage all the disputes. But This still works because the threat of the law and court is there and this makes people comply.

Was a 24hour average. I think that's fair observation to point out considering BCH entire premise of existence is to have lower fees than BTC.
Your second point is valid but also makes the assumption that people/wallets make the decision to pay less Satoshis as the price goes up. Fair enough I suppose. Thanks for pointing that out.
Even still. If btc and BCH have the same dollar value and both have non-full blocks (as currently) then btc should be cheaper. It uses blockspace more efficiently. 
Don't get too worked up over a simple observation.

I've used coinjar (with bpay) and coinbase (with visa card) in Australia. Coinbase turns out to be about 4.5% and coinjar is around 8%(because they put a big spread on it).

I think its an interesting idea, and generally people around here will be happy with anything that has bitcoin involved. But when it starts becoming common place I think we will start to get sick of it. Eventually we will see ads + mining. Websites will try and make as much money as they can get away with. At least ads can be blocked and don't directly cost me (much) money in electricity.

@_date: 2019-01-22 20:53:51
This does a pretty good job at explaining how the channels work. 
I'm a little confused with your examples but the simple answer to your question is that the intermediate nodes never have ownership of the Bitcoin during a payment. They just transfer hash data that will end up giving the end user the right information to receive the LN btc. It all goes through in seconds and if the route fails nothing valuable actually gets sent. So there is no possibility of 'forcing' an intermediate node to pay anything If a channel closes. 
The second layer would not be considered a blockchain since nothing is recorded on a public ledger. It's simply an agreement between two nodes. they could choose to do it by any rules they both agree on. However if they want to make use of the other nodes in the network to route their payment then their rules needs to comply with the set if interoperability protocols of lightning. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:16:45

Although one of the main arguments against raising the blocksize has been that it would increase node sync time and badwidth costs (which are already high) and exclude more people from being able to run a node. With this improvement that is less of a concern and would help reduce these costs making a future blocksize increase more viable which would help keep transactions fees down.

Yes except you will not be able to withdraw your BT1 (it's not real bitcoin). You hold your BT1 on the exchange untill the fork happens then it will automatically turn into BTC. After then you can withdraw it to your wallet.

You are right that many people are ignorant of what money is and how economies work. Very few people know how a central bank works. I believe this is the biggest financial scam in modern history. You do not need to have a economics degree to know that money should not be made out of nothing. Especially by people who are not under the authority of any government or regulator.
People questioning the system is almost always a good thing.  Certainly better then spending your time trying to convince people on reddit that everything is all good and that (contrary to history) the system wont collapse. Let people make their own financial decisions. If that includes buying some gold or bitcoin as a hedge against the dollar than that sounds wise to me. Though I personally think bitcoin will not do well in a financial crash. Not until it is much less speculative.

This node seems to be up to something suspicious.
The owner of the node also ownes the website shitcoin.com, which previously had BTC listed as a 'shitcoin'. 
His reddit account (u/bitcoinArtist) and twitter account ( has a history of support for Bitcoin cash and trashing the lightning network. He is also an advisor to Bitcoin(dot)com. 
All the channels he opens have the exact same amout of Bitcoin (0.16777215 btc). *Edit: this is the current maximum amount per channel.*

He said on Twitter a few days ago that he would be doing a review of the lightning network for his website.

Good question. I don't know.
He may be trying to make a point on how centralized LN is, or how easily a high capacity node could centralize the network. For instance if he convinces a majority of nodes to connect with him (or if he connects with them) then he could force a more hub-and-spoke like topography to form.
After forming the big hub he could then close down all channels suddenly causing a flood of on-chain transactions on the base chain. This is unlikely as it would cost him alot in fees, and would not require having such high capacity channels.
To me it seems most likely that he is just advertising for his website. Which has worked pretty well so far.

Not sure if simpler but...
Bitfinex has a tool for speculating on price of BTC and Segwit2X. You can split BTC into BT1 and BT2 tokens which you can then trade. After the fork BT1 and BT2 tokens will turn into BTC and S2X respectively at a 1:1 basis. 
If you use this tool you can sell your future S2X coins for bitcoin. Then split that new bitcoin into more BT1 and BT2 tokens and sell those tokens. You can keep doing this until the value you have left is too low to trade (0.01BTC I think). Then just hold onto your BT1 token until the fork and you will have more BTC than you had before and don't need to worry about splitting your S2X without replay protection. 
Essentially you can use your profits form selling B2X before the fork to maximise the amount of bitcoin you have during the fork which increases the amount of new coin you get. 
@_date: 2019-09-23 01:36:42
Yes that's essentially it. Except I'm not sure if there is any escrow.
Futures contracts are traditionally used by industry to hedge their risk against future price changes. For instance if you are a farmer and you know you will need 1000 bales of hay next month, you could agree on the price now, and pay for it when the contract expires. That way if there is a crash in hay price your business will not be affected. 
A Bitcoin miner may want to sell his future Bitcoin on a futures contract at the current price. That way if Bitcoin price crashes he is still selling and making profit (though not as much as if the price went up).
Of course there is also just plain old speculation.

The issues you are experiencing is likely due to low node capacity rather than any routing protocal issues. 
I have sent many lighting payments and never had an issue with routing so far. However these were all very small payments. If you are trying payments of $20+ you might start running into trouble. Try opening a channel with a higher capacity node such as this one; [
You could still run into issues if the person you are paying is not well connected to high capacity nodes. 
This will (and is) improve over time as more people trust the network and fund higher capacity channels. 
With regards to your question on routing protocal improvements, I have heard of two so far. 
1. neighbourhood broadcasters. Rather than every user keeping the network data, nodes can choose to be broadcasters for their neighbourhood. These would likely be the wallet providers or watchtowers. These would be considered more centralised because you are trusting a few nodes to give you accurate routing information. I don't think it would be too bad as long as there are multiple broadcasters per neighbourhood and as long as it is easy for anyone to easily verify that they are being honest. 
2. Ant Routing. This is a very early idea and requires a lot more development and simulation. Essentially nodes         send out 'pheromone' signals to nearby nodes which propegate through the network until nodes receive a signal from both ends and is able to connect the route. They would then send this back along the same route to both users and the wallet would select the route that is the cheapest/fastest. Downside is it may be a bit slower, and could be prone to spam attacks.

It's not implausible to remember your seed words. You have already memorize hundreds of people's names. People do memorize their seeds. 
There is also multiple ways of storing the seed in a way that would not be obvious to a thief. Including dividing up the seed into multiple parts. 
If a thief finds an old trezor in a safe there could be ways to crack it - especially if it's not up to date.
If you have a trezor you are going to be storing the seed somewhere anyway in case the trezor dies. So there are multiple attack vectors which dont exist on this 'stateless' device.

Actually when I posted that the 24hr average fee in sat/byte was less for BTC than BCH. As there was a recent spike this is no longer the case. 
The fact that BCH dollar value is less than BTC is not relevant from the perspective of which currency will dominate. If BCH had took over BTC and had the same dollar value then fees would not be any better (based on current performance). BCH has terrible space efficiency so individual transactions are larger.

If you salary was streamed to you by the minute than lightning would be quite well suited even in its current state. 
If each fee was 1 Satoshi (fairly standard on lightning) then you are still only paying about 480 sats (3 cents) in fees per day. If you had a direct channel to your employer then the fees could be 0. 
There are some advantages with a system like this (particularly for casual employees). Employer only pays for the hours you spend clocked in. You get the pay check consistently rather than in chunks (which can be hard for some people to manage with their bills etc). Once the smart contract is setup very little oversight is needed from the accounts department, accept to verify that you are actually at work when you are clocked in. 
Also great for streaming online content, pumping fuel etc. No more trust required by the merchant or the consumer. pay for what you get as you get it.

Gold has been more stable in terms of buying power than the USD. 
It is a matter of debt. The US fiat system is designed to make borrowing money (for spending and investing) as easy as possible. That creates debt. We are now in a position that the entire economy will collapse unless debt keeps growing. No government wants it to collapse on their watch so they keep printing and pushing the can down the road. 
Bitcoin and gold can not be negative. Sure you could borrow in exchange for some other collateral but the total supply remains the same and is always positive. 
Every previously fiat currency has failed. What makes you think the US dollar will be any different?

That's the whole point of being Stateless. The device does not store your seed. Obviously this is more cumbersome but I would suggest it's more secure for someone looking for extreme cold storage.

I think you are trying to say that there wont be an immediate bull run after the approval.
I think you may have confused the words 'Bull' and 'Bear' which makes your comment quite confusing.
The approval of the ETF does not mean they will start trading the next day. It will take months to setup the storage systems, key managment, compliance checks from the SEC.. etc..
The CBOE would be silly to buy bitcoin before any of this is even approved. Even after the approval they don't know what the demand will be. Apart from a little capital for the first few investors they will be waiting to get the customers before taking the risk.
More importantly, it is not the reduced supply that is going to be the primary driver for the bull run. Its the hype. After the approval of futures, bitcoin went on a crazy bullrun, even though there was no product even out and the futures were cash settled. The day the futures came out was the day it all came crashing back down.
I would be expecting a 20% jump on the day the ETF is approved. Minimum. Then a steady bull run right up until launch of the ETF.
Also you mentioned that investors could just buy shares in the ETF. This is false. To invest they need to buy contracts of minimum 25BTC. Each of these contracts needs to be fully backed in BTC and stored by the CBOE.
Strap in.

The solution to the routing problem is not really solved by onion routing. 
The problem is that each node currently has to know information about all other available nodes before calculating the best route. This works fine for now but will not be very efficient when lightning gets to a much bigger scale. 
As far as I am aware there are several options on the table for a better routing solution.

I get the impression that the network can get a lot bigger before the current routing system hits a roof. I'm no communications expert but I don't see why a node couldn't get info from 100,000+ nodes without being too much of an inconvenience (if someone can comment with some math for this that would be great). Or perhaps letting your wallet provider search for this information on your behalf (not necessarily a centralized system because they are just there to improve speed and efficiency).
Another interesting option which would be viable right now is splitting the network routing data into neighborhoods and letting nodes choose to be broadcasters for their neighborhood. I guess this could be considered more centralized but so long as there are multiple broadcasting nodes that are verifying each-other and verifiable by anyone then I don't see any big problems there.
Routing is up to the wallet and not built into the lightning protocol itself. This provides the opportunity for wallets to experiment and put some creative ideas forward.

But you have to hold money on the account which acts as collateral. At a certain point the exchange closes your trade before you run out of money to pay off your debt. Which is referred to as getting liquidated.

Money was waiting on the sidelines for bitcoin to hit the bottom. A big investor thought it was the bottom and bought some bitcoin. Others followed suit, and shorts got liquidated. Some will take profits, but I think there are a lot more that have just been waiting for the cheapest possible bitcoin to get in for a long term invesment. Now that a bull market is signalled they will buy.

I think they would have backups for their keys. In a bank vault somewhere. Or at least a second copy in a waterproof safe. 
With this many machines these guys are dealing with millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. They won't be leaving that on a thumb drive under the desk.
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:33:55
These particular shorts were not closed voluntarily. They were margin called. So the exchange forced the trade to close before their collateral ran out.

You can take it out on lightning layer just not directly from the tipping bot to an onchain Bitcoin address.
So just withdrawal to a lightning wallet then spend how you please. Or close the channel and it's then on chain.
Or you could use 
To generate a LN invoice which you send the the bot and they will exchange it into onchain BTC to an address of your choice.

Jordan Peterson wasn't censored by patreon. He plans to leave it because he doesn't agree with the idea that a few companies/governments should have ultimate control over who can and cannot participate in commerce.
Regardless of if you support his political opinions, you should support his right to transact value without being censored or asking anyone's permission. This is what Bitcoin is about.

Most on chain fees are more than 1000 sat. So it's probably not worth doing that until you get a fair bit more. 
The simplest way would be to use  then copy the invoice in to the withdrawal command on the tip bot. Like I said it will all disappear in fees. 1000 sat is only about 3 cents. 
If your interested in experimenting with lightning more I suggest you setup a Bitcoin lightning wallet on mobile and keep it in the lightning layer. 
Setting up the wallet will use up some Bitcoin in on chain fees but once it's going you get as many near instant free Transactions.

You need to send Bitcoin to the app (press receive funds). Then you use this to fund a channel (after waiting for confirmations). Press 'open new channel' then pick one of the recommended channels. After you have a channel open you can use it to spend on the lightning network. But you won't be able to receive untill you clear up some space on your channel. If your not keen to actually spend money and buy something you could use  to convert your lightning btc back to btc. 
NOTE: you will end up spending more than 1000 Satoshi in fees (which is only worth 3 cents). 
It would be better to just keep in in the lntipbot untill
 you find something you want to spend it on. Here is a list of places you can spend it. 
Just find something you want then when you get the invoice copy this in a private message to the bot with the command '!withdraw'
The idea of this bot is to keep tiny amounts on here that you can use to tip others which might help them become aware of what the lightning network can do. 
The process of setting up a wallet may seem complicated but once it's done you can send Bitcoin instantly for only about 1 or 2 Satoshi fee. This would normally cost around 600 to 5000 Satoshi to send onchain. It's worth the effort if you want to play around but there is not yet many merchants using it. Hopefully things will get easier as better wallets come up that do this process for you.

I agree. Private companies can do what they want and should have the right to do so. But the pressure to shut someone down usualy comes from government regulations rather than the companies own ideals.
Big companies like patreon and paypal playing judge is a problem. Any alternative could mean a huge reduction in revenue. Any centralized alternative would also be under pressure to follow suit. Apart from physically exchanging cash (which is also getting locked down) it is reasonable to say that he could be prevened from transacting value. It's happened to others. 
Bitcoin is better.
