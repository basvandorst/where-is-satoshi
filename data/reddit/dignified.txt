Negatory.  They will hold a *slight* magnetic charge so long as they are in a magnetic field, but that's about it.

So does a bank.  Just sayin'.

This needs to be solved before any real widespread adoption can take place. We need to be honest about what will happen as users are added en masse.   
Its currently 15GB +/-.  Throw another couple hundred million users into this and [this line is going vertical. ]( 90°.  It ***will*** eventually outpace the tech.  It needs to be handled  *before* we pile on more. 
We need to help this develop towards widespread adoption, not kid ouselves that real issues dont need to be overcome.

If someone else will confirm this (couldn't take a pic and drive at the same time); on the way to LasVegas, coming from.California, there is a barn near yermo with a spray paint sign on the side.  'Warning.  You are entering the county of the most corrupt sheriff in America.'

Pretty big assumption on your part.

I'm am in the "guns and gold" crowd.  My concern over virtual currency stems from the nature of it's location.  You need working internet access to use it.  That requires a working infrastructure.  
While I'm sure that there are some people who might include virtuals in their plan, the price point makes them unrealistic given the unreliable nature of it's delivery system.

We see the bigger concept in the huge insurmountable problems everyone who subscribes to that philosophy is having.

I like the concept of digital currency.  It needs work. 
A few problems intrinsic in the DCs: 
1 requires internet access (easy but can be cut off for a plethora of reasons) 
2 requires secure internet (not possible in the us and much of the world).
3 as soon as/if financial institutions dump funds into flesh-eating, algorithm-stomping monster unit that will be the end of that. 
'...in my head.'  No, it isnt.  Its on the internet, which none of us here control.  
Nothing wrong with diversified holdings including both DC and PM.  My little silver stash started years ago has some that I got for $3+/- oz.  Selling those now is a 500%+ increase.  Not to shabby.

US took all their gold, reforged it and is sending/will send/has sent it to Germany, France or one of the line of countries that want their gold back.  First thing they did.

If I may;  I got interested in virtual currency back in the dwolla days.  It, like any other item, will fluctuate in value.  That isn't a problem.
The intrinsic problem with virtual currency is two-fold.  First, it requires electricity.  In any problem scenario, that might be problematic.  As is the second problem; internet access.  Same restrictions as the first problem.
