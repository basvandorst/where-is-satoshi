Stopped reading right there. Life is too short to listen to some idiot repeat the same old bullshit.

You're 38. That's my guess based on your memes.
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:44:35
That's an ad hominem attack. Pathetic.

I'm not a liberal, but you're definitely mentally ill
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:13:54
Wow that was a mentally ill wall of text

I haven't read anything you've said to me, I hope you know. Anyways, you're a loser :(

LMAO thank you, that's the LAMEST use of a meme I've ever seen. Fucking hilarious. You talk like you're twelve but meme like a grandma. Are you 50??

Please relax. We're not going to have a productive conversation with you being all upset and condescending.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:13:08
Wow you are not as smart as you try to appear. You literally learned what ad hominem was this year on reddit.

Why should I provide any type of substance to a random internet loser? I'm just pointing out that you're a loser. Other people tore apart your attempt at an argument already. You're pathetic lol.
Please, make another whiney response about how I don't respect you enough to engage you. Please, cry some more in my inbox.
