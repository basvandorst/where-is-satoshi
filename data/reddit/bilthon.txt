It's not a black box! you can always check what it's doing internally. Here's the code for the `BitcoinPublicKey` class: 
But the interesting part actually makes use of the hashes contained in the `hash.py` file. Specifically at line [34]( you can see that all it does is the following double hash:  ripemd160(sha256(message)).

I can't really open that site of yours so I cannot replicate that. But using pybitcoin do the following.
    &gt;&gt;&gt;from pybitcoin import BitcoinPublicKey
    &gt;&gt;&gt;pub_key = BitcoinPublicKey('037cb4433473b8a644b89c6932f648c0ccc2c6974ffa0df57c6337a397cc024ed2')
    &gt;&gt;&gt;pub_key.hash160()
    &gt;&gt;&gt;'32fb2cfd2ac1104e68aa93d6992c89ae78f752b9'
And there you have it. You can verify that's the hash that was pushed at the 5th (index = 4) output of this transaction:

What loosing end? you don't loose anything by relaying payments, on the contrary, that's when you actually make up a little bit of commission. Yes, you might need to re-balance your funds at some point, but for that to have happened you must have moved a lot of funds and thus made up enough money to pay for this re-balancing. Plus I've also heard of off-chain rebalancing techniques, like this one from some ETH guys:  and this other from blockstream: 
 &gt; You would need to convince people to use your node. You would do that by providing value by being connected to other nodes that are connected to people they want to pay. Then you will need to manage the costs of all that. 
This much is true. For you to be attractive for other peers you have to have a lot of connections. And this is a problem specially now that the LN testnet only allow for single-funded channels. But dual-funded channels are also being discussed. This way you could split a portion of your funds just to connect to important hubs and use the rest to connect to peers, provided that they also fund their side of the channel. This is good for both of you since you end up creating new alternative routes in case the main hubs go down and it is good for the network as well as it will foster connectivity between peers. For more about dual-funded channels see here:

No, if I HAD the property. Not if I had a mortgage on it. In my view you don't own it unless you are debt free.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:33:56
If I had a property I would surely be encouraging my tenant to pay me in BTC.

Except that anyone will be able to "act as a bank" of sorts while getting a banking license in the real world is extremely costly. That's why they call it permission-less innovation.
But really, think about it. If you have a decent amount of BTC laying around, why would you have them just gather dust in cold storage while you could make them work for you?
And finally, remember that even though we're comparing this to the banking system, the analogy would still be incorrect since there's no fractional reserve here. All the funds locked in payment channels are still backed 100% by real bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:03:33


No! that is not you being your bank, that is you lending your money to somebody else being a bank. What I'm talking about is about you setting up a LN from your home and "invest" a part of your bitcoins in the creation of payment channels.

I bet that with the valuation we've seen in the last years you can find A LOT of people that fill both requirements. A lot of capital simply because 1 BTC is quite a lot nowadays, and technical people were precisely the kind of people that were probably hoarding coins to begin with.
And to be honest, having a LN node and opening channels is not that much different than having your bitcoins in your laptop and is surely much better than keeping them in an exchange. The channel management can be done automatically in the background without much user interaction. What percentage of current bitcoin holders do you think use cold storage (which I grant you, would be the safer alterative) anyways?
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:23:18
I downvoted this mainly because it gives me no way to idependently verify. 
Which exchange is this data from? The chart was clipped in a way that it didn't keep the date in the x axis.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it was fabricated. In fact I think it is highly likely. But if a post doesn't provide a way for people to independently verify its data, it is not contributing with signal but rather noise. Let's not make this subreddit be just another echo chamber.

Ok, here's what I wanted: 
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:52:11
You clearly lack the understanding of how disastrous such a proposal would be. The blockchain will be so huge that in just a few years only major datacenters would be able to host it, reducing the number of full nodes and leaving the network vulnerable to attacks and exploits such as the one that took out most of the BU nodes last week.

There has been an awakening
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:54:21


This is not FUD, is just a realistic and pragmatic approach to a very real danger, which would set us all back a few years until the dust settles.

Yeah, it's great and all, but it is really not very good OPSEC dude.

Then again, to be fair, bitcoin is NOT about low fees. Sometimes we do get the luxury of bragging about that, but that's not the core value proposition of it. 
The main value proposition has always been sound money with scheduled issuance and self sovereignty. You own your private keys and thus you own your money. Never in the history of mankind has value been so easy to conceal and hard to take by force. This is why it is important.
Low fees are cool, but they are not the main selling point.

I still can't help but to chuckle every time I see that crazy bcash mempool graph

Actually there seems to be someone with a very interesting proposal that could benefit of this setup already.
I have nowhere near that amount of BTC, but would also be very interested in participating in such an endeavor.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:03:13
But wouldn't the BTC spend tx be valid on the B2X and thus ruin the plan?
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:17:08
Sorry, but I don't get it. I thought the lock would hold both TX for the same amount of time. I'm not that familiar with the bitcoin scripting language. So you're basically saying that we can create 2 spend TXs, one for each party and each with different lock times?  
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:20:23
Cool! the only remaining problem I see has to do with what RHavar said above:


That and finding a B2X supporter with the balls, of course! :P

I was thinking of a multisig address funded just after both parties exchange their corresponding output transaction using CheckLockTimeVerify in order to freeze the funds for a period of six months or so. But I guess the lack of replay protection would also render this kind of construct meaningless, right?

Great video! hope to see more coming!

The technology stack running below is devoid of value were it not for us, the community. But misinformation can make new users choose the wrong wallet/exchange. So I see no harm in putting together signatures and pressure big players like Coinbase in such a way. 
In fact if ALL of us just stayed quiet and did nothing expecting "bitcoin to work" it would certainly fail, because we are part of the human machinery that makes bitcoin tick. So if you agree with most of us that 2X is not in the best interest of the community, just do your part and help spread the word.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:33:23


So you want to purposely make it hard for users to split them, which is akin to forcing them in to the new chain you deem to be the right one. I can't help to be reminded of the USA government pushing "democracy" right down the throat of invaded countries.

According to nullc there's a way to setup this in a trustless way. See:

This is why I think in many ways we gave up our finantial freedom and right to privacy a long time ago. And the surveillance programs Snowden uncovered are just the natural next step in that process.
With the excuse of catching the bad guys, we all have to have our private finantial data and movements carefully tracked down.

I used to use MultibitHD for more than a year now. But a couple of weeks was locked out of my account that way too. I contacted support, and they were very helpful in pointing out that they don't use BIP44. No wonder why my seed words wouldn't produce any single of my used public addresses. That had started to get me worried that I had it wrong.
When I offered to move my funds out of the account and then providing them with my seed words I was turned down. This is a reproducible bug, it happened in a fresh installation of their wallet in my girlfriend's laptop. And has to do with a problem in some specific tx deserialization. As a developer I would be eager to get a way to reproduce this very rare bug, so that it can be fixed. But they don't seem to care much.
I moved to electrum now, their UI is really ugly, but who cares if it works right? they even provide the replaceable fees feature, which nowdays is a must.
