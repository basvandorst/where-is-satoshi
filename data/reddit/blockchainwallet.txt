Hey CryptoBudha, 
Awesome name by the way, we plan to get this feature re-added into a future build. It wasn't initially prioritized but it's on the roadmap. As an active bitcoin user we'd love to get your feedback on our new HD wallet if you haven't already giving it a gander.

Hey BitcoinNL, 
We're happy to help, can you please open a support case with our team here: 
Thanks, we'll look into it right away.

Hey cyph3r_punk, 
Hang tight, we'll be rolling out an HD wallet for Android soon. We're incrementally pushing updates but we're very close. 
As an active Bitcoin user we would love to get your input. Here's an HD web wallet to play with:

Hey, 
We've been seeing record traffic this week but the site should be performing normally. It might be a localized network issue. 
Where are you checking it from?

@_date: 2015-06-20 20:21:16
If you are a user impacted by this please contact Blockchain.info via blockchain.zendesk.com, and say Mandrik sent you. Users should also update to the latest version of the Android app to fix this. Thank you. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:44:38
Our client-side encryption prevents anyone at Blockchain.info from studying your balance a.k.a any of your addresses.

Hey all, 
We report phishing sites the instant we're made aware of them to Google and work as closely and expeditiously as possible when these pop up to get them taken down. Unfortunately, it's not 100% in our control but anyone can help by reporting issues here:
The more notifications Google receives the more likely they are to respond quickly. 
Thanks for keeping a lookout!
Sincerely,

Hey NginUS, we're investigating some latency with our Receive Payments API at the moment. We apologize for any inconvenience this may be causing. If you haven't already submitted a case with our support team please do so here:

Hey everyone, 
We're aware and investigating the issue. We're sorry for the inconvenience and working to get things running smoothly again. 
We'll be posting with updates the moment we have them.

Hi everyone,
Thanks for your patience regarding this issue. 
Our services have now been restored &amp; we will keep monitoring the situation closely. User funds are safe.

@_date: 2014-05-13 21:35:08
All good now!
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:54:50
BTW, this is from Mandrik, the one true Chef Security Officer of Blockchain, not that poor excuse for a line cook Andreas!
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:24:04
It's related to Cloudflare, which is active again. Sorry for any hassle this is causing.
@_date: 2014-09-19 23:59:20
The issue is resolved now. Sorry for inconvenience!
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:40:50
I can understand any concern since the site has been down for about 18 hours, but all wallets are still 100% safe &amp; secure. Our team has been up working on this database issue, and we will certainly provide more details as to what happened once we get everything back up and running. We always like to be up front and open with the bitcoin community, and that will continue. We're not faceless, nameless people who work for this organization. In fact, you can see most of our faces here - 
Make sure you're following  on Twitter for the latest news and updates.

Here's an update on the issue:
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:13:54
I think it's important to note that there have never been any promises of complete anonymity when using Shared Coin. With that said we are looking into ways to improve privacy for users who send via SharedCoin.
@_date: 2014-11-29 15:59:04
Can you PM me your ticket number please?
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:36:07
Nope, it's not a DDoS attack.
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:55:42
Thank you for not panicking. :) We're back!
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:41:28
I blame myself. This past weekend I was commenting to my wife, Alyson (who also works for Blockchain) how calm and quiet it's been in the bitcoin world. I had to go and jinx it all!
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:21:19
I'm writing new text for the page right now. :D
@_date: 2014-11-29 15:22:19
Hey there, and sorry to hear of this. Can you open a ticket at blockchain.zendesk.com? You can mention Mandrik sent you from Reddit.
Thanks, and sorry again to hear about this. We can try to work together to determine how this happened.
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:14:36
We're definitely seeing this problem and looking into this right now. Thanks for bringing this to our attention, and sorry for the problems.
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:36:55
Hey guys, we're aware of the issues right now. I don't have any information yet as to the exact cause, but we're looking into this right now. Sorry for any inconveniences.
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:43:55
You know all those scenes in movies where some insane, world-changing event happens, and everyone stops to stare in awe? Like in Independence Day when the alien ships first appear in the sky. That's a normal Thursday in the bitcoin world. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 20:15:50
Hi, 
We're sorry you had a negative experience. Hopefully we can make a better impression next time. We've traveled around the planet to Bitcoin conferences, meetups, and grass roots events. It's our hope to always make a positive impression. 
Humbly, the Blockchain Team
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:23:04
You can add P2SH addresses as "Watch Only" and send funds to them from within the new wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-29 20:20:45
Open a ticket at blockchain.zendesk.com. I can help you recover the old wallet identifier. Feel free to mention this post!
@_date: 2014-04-29 02:11:36
Not yet, and we're aware of this. We're working on a solution!
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:41:48
We've initiated a takedown against this site. Thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2014-11-30 07:09:21
Hey, Blockchain Support here. Thanks for reporting the Phishing site to Google. Can you share the link with us so we can begin a takedown request
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:23:18
 :D
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:35:57
By the way, this tea is DELICIOUS! Alyson, Blockchain's social media outreach expert (along with my super awesome wife), brewed some yesterday and it was amazing. We'll definitely order more soon.

Since we don't store any personal information on a user we have no way of knowing what the ballpark figure is on unique users.

Hi OP!
Glad to hear one of the other Redditors was able to help you with this. Our support team typically responds within several hours, depending on whether there is some sort of outage or widespread issue or not. Feel free to [reach out to us again]( if for some reason you find the issue hasn't been resolved. :)

Hah! Blockchain.info isn't a one man operation. Check out our team here: 
@_date: 2014-04-21 21:17:26
There are some on going issues right now, and it relates to this blog post we made a couple days ago -  Sorry for any problems.
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:21:04
Definitely aware of these, and we're working to resolve them right now. This still relates to the issues caused during the site downtime. Sorry about the troubles!
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:43:59
Will do!
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:27:54
This is unexpected maintenance. We obviously don't want to just take the servers down unannounced. I can assure you that this wasn't any type of security issue, and all wallets are 100% safe. This is a hardware problem, and we're working to resolve it right now.
(I'm cross posting this message, so you may see me repeating it elsewhere.)
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:53:28
We had a hiccup, but things are back to normal!
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:32:38
It's being worked on. Definitely one of our top priorities right now, and it will be ready when it's ready. ;)
@_date: 2014-04-29 20:20:17
The iPhone app is no longer supported, and that includes the Cydia version. We're working on an HTML5 site that users can access from any smartphone.

Open a ticket - blockchain.zendesk.com. I can help you out!
@_date: 2014-04-18 19:03:55
FYI -  
seems to be related to this - 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:16:21
We've been reporting these phishing sites, and having them removed, but they keep popping back up. I'd always encourage users to avoid third party links as much as possible. Better to be extra paranoid when it comes to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:37:40
There are a lot of updates constantly being posted to Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and our blog. I'd encourage you to keep tabs on all of them. I'm also responding to support tickets as quickly as possible. Communication is a HUGE concern for the Blockchain team, and we're not going to have any radio silence with the bitcoin world. That's not how we do things.
Once the site is 100% operational we'll have a more detailed explanation of what happened. As services are slowly brought back up we'll let you know. I made this Reddit post with some updates - 
@_date: 2014-05-06 18:11:42
Yogurt talk until then! :D
@_date: 2014-05-07 22:30:30
Thanks for catching this! This should be fixed now.
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:14:47
We're definitely seeing this problem and looking into this right now. Thanks for bringing this to our attention, and sorry for the problems.
@_date: 2014-03-18 14:13:51
Update - 
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:00:38
We always want to stay in contact with the community! :)
If you need to access your funds *right now*, and you have the private keys backed up, then you can import them into any other wallet client.
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:43:13
No biscuits until this is fixed! ;)
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:26:55
Yes, it's down for unexpected maintenance. We obviously don't want to just take the servers down unannounced. I can assure you that this wasn't any type of security issue, and all wallets are 100% safe. This is a hardware problem, and we're working to resolve it right now.
@_date: 2014-11-30 10:40:28
Hey, thank you for the heads up. It's not one of our ads, but it does appear to go to the valid blockchain.info site. We still recommend always typing  into your browser address bar to be 100% sure you know where you are going. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:10:05
There are some things we plan on releasing in the near future, mainly an HTML5 web wallet that you'll be able to access from any smartphone without having to download an app. No ETA yet, but it's in the works!
@_date: 2014-11-29 15:15:21
Hey guys! We highly encourage Tor users to use  when connecting to Blockchain.info via Tor. Thanks!

@_date: 2014-03-01 00:11:20
No problem, and don't sweat it. :)
@_date: 2014-06-30 09:48:30
Hey, this mix-up with the flags is fixed, and will be visible in the next update. 
Thanks for pointing it out!
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:04:03
When making a scheduled software update overnight to our web-wallet, our development team inadvertently affected a part of our software that ensures private keys are generated in a strong and secure manner.
The issue was present for a brief period of time between the hours of 12:00am and 2:30am GMT on December the 8th 2014. The issue was detected quickly and immediately resolved. In total, this issue affected less than 0.0002% of our user base and was limited to a few hundred addresses.
We have sent an alert to all users who have potentially vulnerable addresses in their wallets, for which we have an email on file. We are committed to working with any affected users to assess and rectify any issues.
If you created a wallet, generated a new address via Blockchain.info’s web-wallet, or sent bitcoin from your wallet during this time period and have not provided us with your email address, please contact our support desk at support or simply create a new wallet.
Addresses, wallets and transactions created via the Blockchain.info iOS and Android apps, and the Chrome extension are not affected.
If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Blockchain.info Development Team

This user is posting a phishing link - Please report him!
@_date: 2014-04-23 12:29:15
The issue was fixed. Check out the chart now.
Thanks again for bringing this to our attention!
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:27:49
That may just be a generic error message. The server this service is connected to is likely not fully back online yet.
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:53:15
I passed this info on. Thanks for the heads up!
edit: Should be fixed.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:23:37
This is related to an ongoing issue that we posted about on our blog -  I would keep an eye on our Twitter, Facebook, and/or blog feeds for further updates. Thank you for your patience with this matter.
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:53:30
I'm notifying Piuk &amp; the team about this now. Thanks for the heads up!

Hi, 
We're making a scheduled update and it will be back online shortly. 
We apologize for the inconvenience. 
You're quick on the draw!
@_date: 2014-11-18 16:00:57
Hey guys, Mandrik with Blockchain support here. Our developers looked over this and have fixed the issue. The fix will be deployed during our next site update.
This will be seen on our web wallet first, but we will be addressing this issue on iOS &amp; Android. Thank you for bringing this to our attention!
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:38:07
Hey all! Blockchain.info does have a bug report form here for the Android app:
@_date: 2014-07-19 17:28:37
Shared Coin, Blockchain.info's CoinJoin implementation,will be added to the app in a future update. Sending to, and receiving from, a P2SH address works within the wallet. You can easily add P2SH addresses as Watch Only addresses and send funds to these.
@_date: 2014-05-07 21:11:13
Please do not hesitate to notify us with any questions &amp; concerns - privacy Thanks!
Blockchain.info User Experience Expert
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:28:18
SharedCoin is currently disabled because of the malleability issues. We're taking a conservative approach until this issue is resolved.
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:18:18
We'll get this take care of. Sorry for the confusion!
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:57:13
Hi there, 
We highly recommend making sure you activate Two Factor Authentication (2FA) -- also, please consider double encrypting your wallet. This can be turned on via the Settings button from your wallet home. 
Remember, Blockchain never has access to your passwords, but if there is malware on your computer there could be an issue. 
The secondary password option provides you the ability to trick conceal the password from key-loggers, because we display a full keyboard for you to use your mouse to type in the secret phrase. Think of the secondary password like an extra secret password you have to input before moving funds. 
Hope this helps!
@_date: 2014-12-07 20:13:04
We do require 2FA for all accounts that have a verified email address (which isn't a requirement). We strongly believe there is a careful balance between enforcing requirements and having a zero barrier to entry service. 
Your point about annoying people vs. the reputation risk is definitely something we relate to. 
Thanks for your input!
@_date: 2014-10-15 21:40:06
Thanks for reporting this, OP. We're working on taking this site down now.

Here's the post:
Blockchain is pleased to announce the changing role of Andreas M. Antonopoulos from Chief Security Officer to advisor to the Board. During his time as CSO, Andreas has provided expert guidance and a seasoned perspective on security, infrastructure, hiring, operations and public communications. Andreas’ keen insights, leadership and hands-on attitude have allowed Blockchain to improve risk management and security from infrastructure to operations. 
Andreas was hired as the CSO of Blockchain to improve security practices and risk management within the company as Blockchain matured and moved from its startup phase and into its growth phase. We are now firmly positioned in the growth phase. Andreas’ contributions at Blockchain have left the company stronger, more secure and ready to serve millions of consumers around the world.  
At this time we are building infrastructure to meet our anticipated growth, which includes building a full-time security engineering team. Although we wish he could, Andreas, as an author, speaker, and advisor to other startups in the space, cannot devote his full-time exclusive focus to these tasks. 
As a result, we are offering Andreas a position on our advisory board, where he can continue to help Blockchain change the way the world transacts. The primary responsibility for security engineering will remain with Ben Reeves, Blockchain’s Founder and CTO.
We look forward to Andreas’ continued contributions as an Advisor and wish him the best in his future endeavors. Thanks Andreas! 
The Blockchain Team

Hi, our DNS servers are experiencing problems, so our site is not reachable. Site is fine, wallets safe, just need fix DNS issue. Blockchain users can use blockchain.com/wallet/login to access wallets, while we resolve the .info domain problems.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:39:29
No problem! :D
@_date: 2014-12-04 13:18:40
We track our performance using pingdom which you can verify below. The past 31 days we've had 2hrs of downtime including our planned releases. 
We're continuing to work hard to get to 100%
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:51:38
We actually type out the business name as **B**lockchain or **B**lockchain.info. I have personally called the business Blockchain.info for a while now (especially in person), but we also maintain Blockchain.com. There will be more coming from that site in the near future. Saying "Blockchain" is very different than saying "the blockchain," but I'm more than happy to clear up any confusion from a bitcoin neophyte who contacts us with questions.
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:05:37
It's definitely an unexpected maintenance thing regarding a database issue. We'll be back as soon as possible!
edit: I can assure you that this wasn't any type of security issue, and all wallets are 100% safe. This is a hardware problem, and we're working to resolve it right now.

Hey there! Can you open a ticket at blockchain.zendesk.com with this request? Thanks so much!

Hey there Blockchain Support here, sorry to hear of this. Can you open a ticket at [blockchain.zendesk.com](
You can mention Mandrik sent you from Reddit.
Thanks, and sorry again to hear about this. We can try to work together to determine how this happened.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:11:30
One other thing - blog.blockchain.info now redirects to blog.blockchain.com.

We have decided to change the default setting for automatic email backups. This will now need to be manually enabled for all new wallets. Existing wallets have not been impacted by this. If you have any questions feel free to open a ticket at blockchain.zendesk.com. Thanks!

Still no ETA. I'd keep an eye on our Twitter page &amp; blog. All updates will be posted there.
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:27:39
Email backups are no longer sent out by default. A user must first verify an email address and then manually enable email backups from within their wallet's account settings.
@_date: 2014-12-08 02:09:37
Hey there. 
Can you create a ticket at blockchain.zendesk.com? We should be able to help you out. Just mention Mandrik sent you from Reddit. :)

@_date: 2014-09-19 23:59:24
The issue is resolved now. Sorry for inconvenience!
@_date: 2014-04-04 23:32:38
Shared Send is no longer active. It's still listed in the Android app, but this will be removed in the next update. Sorry for the confusion!
SharedCoin works, and you can use that from your computer for now. ;)
@_date: 2014-06-09 14:45:35
We've reported it as well, and we will continue to report these issues to Google until they stop allowing ads from scammers.
@_date: 2014-12-08 02:51:41
Hi OP - 
You are correct, we are pushing some updates. 
We did recently change our SSL cert when we moved to a provider that would issue one for our .onion. At the same time, we also began using an EV cert. 
thanks! 
@_date: 2014-12-15 12:15:44
We're seeing a surge in traffic. We're working with CloudFlare now to mitigate the disruption. 
Most pages are back except for the home page. For e.g. you should be able to get to:

@_date: 2014-03-07 17:37:46
Mandrik of Blockchain.info here. I receive a lot of generous tips from users for helping them out. I'm always amazed at the generosity of bitcoin users. We have some of the kindest people in this community, and I wanted to pay it forward. So I just sent all the tips I've received since the end of January to Dorian:
Thanks, Andreas!
@_date: 2014-05-01 15:09:35
That's actually where Blockchain.info is based. We have a flying fortress that hovers over the ocean. :)

We're deploying an HTML 5 wallet ;) -- soon!
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:20:05
Looking into this now.
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:01:39
These are likely older payments sent/received from a few days ago. Sorry for any confusion here. We definitely do not have access to your funds. We're still working out some things from the server downtime.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will see what we can do to remedy this problem.

Here's the latest update from 
On Monday March 17th, Blockchain services experienced a series of technical issues that originated from a database error and resulted in suspension of services. The issue was entirely unrelated to the earlier problems with the SharedCoin service; it was simply a timing coincidence. This was not the result of hacking or attacks, or of any suspicious activity. It was simply the result of an obscure bug and a combination of technical factors that expressed this bug under heavy load.
For those tech savvy people, the specific problem that caused our database cluster to crash was MySQL Error code 625 and 2352. The error in our database affected several tables, across several replicated copies of our database system, specifically those tracking information that is also contained in the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. We were able to diagnose the problem quickly, but because of the very large size of the data sets and the extent of the problem, the fix was not easy. The two specific error codes are only sparsely documented on the web. We decided to pursue multiple methods to try to fix the problem, including re-compiling a custom version of MySQL to get around the error, while simultaneously restoring databases from our backup systems onto new servers. Because of the large dataset, each step in testing, restoring or copying data can take a very long time, making the entire process slow.
A few important facts: at no time were the customer funds or wallets at risk of theft or loss. Blockchain’s architecture ensures that we do not have access to the users’ unencrypted keys. Furthermore, our systems maintain multiple layers of replication and backup to ensure service continuity. During the outage, our customers were able to restore their wallets directly onto other Bitcoin clients, such as Multibit. Transactions and account balances were unaffected, because the customer funds are stored on the decentralized Bitcoin blockchain, not on our servers. Nevertheless, we recognize that this outage has caused concern and disrupted our customer’s use of the web wallet service, causing inconvenience. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience.
Today, Tuesday March 18th, Blockchain’s services are partially restored and we continue to work hard to restore full services. The Blockchain explorer functionality, which allows people to search in the Bitcoin blockchain has been restored. We are still restoring databases and rebuilding services in a phased approach. Over the next 72 hours, we anticipate all services will return to normal, though we hope to have many restored much sooner than that. We are also adding new servers to support the higher-than-usual traffic we anticipate as services are restored. If you need urgent access to your funds, please follow the instructions here to restore to a desktop client or send us a support request here, if you don’t have a backup of your wallet. You can access your funds independently of our service.
Rest assured, your funds are safe, your wallet backups are safe, our services will soon resume without any loss other than to our pride. After this incident is over, we will conduct a full review; we will publish more information about exactly what happened and lessons learned. We will continue to improve our infrastructure to ensure we are much more resilient in the future and are ready to serve our 1.4 million and fast growing user base. We appreciate your support and patience and we promise you that we are working as hard as possible, around the clock and around the globe to fulfill our responsibilities to our users.
Thank you for your support and patience,
Blockchain Team

Hi, 
Team Blockchain here, we're sorry if you've had a negative experience and hope you consider coming back. There are a lot of helpful tips for how to secure your wallet here:
Remember, Blockchain doesn't every have access to your password, it is impossible for us to steal or lose your coins, however malware can be a serious issue. We highly recommend setting up two factor authentication too.

We analyzed this bug and found that it if exploited, an attacker can cause a wallet to show incorrect balances. However, an attacker must spend bitcoin to do so. We have developed and tested a fix, which was part of the reason for the downtime. A full deployment of the fix will take up to three hours of maintenance mode, so we will deploy it during a time of day with less user activity. It does not allow user balances to be compromised or funds stolen. 
Blockchain routinely fixes security and other bugs via the CrowdCurity platform. Unfortunately, in this, we did not respond to the OP fast enough and our own internal training around escalating issues correctly from support was insufficient. We will reinforce this internally.
We apologize that CrowdCurity registration is offline at the moment, but in the meantime we invite anyone, including the OP, to email us at security with any security related concerns or information. 
Thanks for your understanding.

FYI - 
@_date: 2014-11-30 17:36:22
Mandrik with Blockchain.info here. 2FA on a Blockchain.info wallet prevents someone from logging into your wallet via blockchain.info with just the password. Our wallets service allows you to have 100% complete control over your funds. If you have a backup of the wallet then you can decrypt this offline with just your wallet password. No 2FA is necessary for this, as you aren't accessing our servers to log into your wallet. Storing wallet backups as securely as possible will prevent any thefts from taking place. If you have email backups enabled (this isn't enabled by default any more) then we strongly encourage you to have 2FA setup with your email provider. Always use unique, complicated passwords/passphrases, too.
I hope this helps answer your question. You can read more on how our wallets work here -

We don't currently have an email being sent from the address shown in that screenshot. Based on the content of the email, I can tell it is not from us, because it suggests we have the ability to block your account (which we don't), in a horribly grammatically incorrect fashion.

Once again, wallet backups are 100% safe and sound. We're initiating a phased restore right now, but the wallet section isn't up yet. More news to come soon!
edit1: Double balance issue is being worked on *right now.* Getting wallet service back up remains  priority.

Hi, 
Team Blockchain here, with a strong password and two factor authenticator turned on Blockchain is a very secure and reliable wallet. We open source all of our software, we've been free since our founding, and we provide code auditing of all our javascript here:
We work around the clock to help thousands of new users get started every day. Once and a while, passwords are forgotten or individual users compromised. In these cases we do everything we can to help, but it's so important to remember that Blockchain never has access to your private keys a.k.a passwords. 
Hopefully we can earn you trust. Our Android wallet has strong ratings from thousands and thousands of reviewers but a few people can make a lot of noise when they want to. 
Either way, we're here to help and support the bitcoin community.

We have a procedure in place for 2FA reset requests submitted via this page:
There are certain procedures we follow before approving a 2FA reset request. The best practice is to setup a secret phrase in the "Security" section of "Account Settings." If this is enabled then 2FA cannot be removed from the wallet unless the secret phrase is included in the reset request.

Blockchain never has access to your addresses or private keys. 
It also means our support team has no optics into wallet balances or addresses. 
As part of our process to reimburse users we have to ask for their input and review each wallet individually. 
Here is how we’re doing it. First, we ask wallet owners to set up a completely new wallet then move any remaining funds into completely new addresses. Next, once the wallet with issues has an empty balance, we’re asking users for their original passwords so we can decrypt the wallets and confirm they were in custody of the weakly generated address at the time the funds were swept. Finally, upon confirmation they owned the address we’re reimbursing them to a new address provided by the end user. 
We warn them very clearly to move the funds first and never use that wallet again. 
We realize this is a stressful time for many and we’re working around the clock to wrap up the reimbursements. So far we’re processed hundreds and if you have questions or concerns drop us a case at blockchain.zendesk.com

Here's an update from Andreas Antonopoulos, our Chief Security Officer:
Blockchain is experiencing a technical issue that has forced us to
temporarily interrupt services. The outage was caused by a bug in some
database handling code. We are working hard to fix the issue and restore
service as soon as possible, but anticipate the outage may last more
than an hour, as it requires restarting database servers with very large
data sets. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this recent
outage has caused you.
Please rest assured that your wallets are safe and this outage does not
affect the security of funds or the completion of executed transactions.
Our preference is not to take Blockchain.info down without announcement,
but the situation that presented itself made it necessary. We will
update you as soon as our services are back online.
We are working hard to improve the resilience and continuity of our
services and are investing in software, hardware and operations to
minimize and then eliminate such outages, even while we increase the
scale of our service which is growing at an exponential rate.
The outage is completely unrelated to a previous problem with
SharedCoin, which was resolved shortly before this unrelated
issue emerged.
Thank you for your patience!

@_date: 2014-11-27 16:58:55
Hi Redditors, 
Team Blockchain here. We take privacy and security seriously and it’s deeply concerning every time someone reports a breach. The top three issues right now are:
* Malicious Tor exit nodes
* Weak password management
* Sophisticated phishing attacks
We have been working with some of the top bitcoin and network security researchers to identify malicious Tor exit nodes and warning users against the use of the Tor network in general. Sophisticated hackers are using Tor to compromise individual wallets and escape untraced. We’ve tweeted about this issue [ and recommended that users disable Tor access within their wallets. 
For those interested you can read more about the Tor network issue here: [
If you want to disable Tor access as well as take some other steps to improve the security of your Blockchain wallets here’s how:
The second issue we see is weak password management. It’s very tempting to use the same password online for different services but it also greatly increases your risk profile. We highly recommend using very strong, very unique passwords. Many community members rely on services like LastPass, Dashlane, or open source desktop solutions that never touch the web to create complicated passwords. Also, one of the strongest ways to improve security is to familiarize yourself with Two-Factor Authentication, which requires a unique and perishable code to gain access to your wallet. 
You can set this up now here:
Over the past year, as Bitcoin has attracted a lot of attention it has also aroused the interests of digital thieves who create fake landing pages, send malicious emails, and even impersonate Blockchain employees to attempt to solicit login credentials. We have been spending tens of thousands of dollars quarterly, even when we were bootstrapped without outside funding, to take down phishing sites. We also work directly with Google, ISPs, and network providers to fight these issues daily. 
There is always a tradeoff between convenience and security. We try to keep the barriers to wallet creation as low as possible so anyone in the world can create a Bitcoin wallet for free. We recently disabled automatic email backups because email access isn’t hardened enough for many users. To be clear, wallet backups have always been encrypted but if weak passwords were used there is a risk the backup could be brute forced by guessing common phrases. 
We provide software that lets users manage and spend their own Bitcoins, without tracking,  interference or permission. This also means that to a certain extent, our role is limited to educating users about best practices and innovating security features. 
To this end, we are developing tools that will help users learn about security and audit their own security. 
We've been blessed with a lot of great feedback that has helped us improve. If you have suggestions, we would welcome them here or at security

Latest update from our blog:
On Monday March 17th, Blockchain services experienced a series of technical issues that originated from a database error and resulted in suspension of services. The issue was entirely unrelated to the earlier problems with the SharedCoin service; it was simply a timing coincidence. This was not the result of hacking or attacks, or of any suspicious activity. It was simply the result of an obscure bug and a combination of technical factors that expressed this bug under heavy load.
For those tech savvy people, the specific problem that caused our database cluster to crash was MySQL Error code 625 and 2352. The error in our database affected several tables, across several replicated copies of our database system, specifically those tracking information that is also contained in the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. We were able to diagnose the problem quickly, but because of the very large size of the data sets and the extent of the problem, the fix was not easy. The two specific error codes are only sparsely documented on the web. We decided to pursue multiple methods to try to fix the problem, including re-compiling a custom version of MySQL to get around the error, while simultaneously restoring databases from our backup systems onto new servers. Because of the large dataset, each step in testing, restoring or copying data can take a very long time, making the entire process slow.
A few important facts: at no time were the customer funds or wallets at risk of theft or loss. Blockchain’s architecture ensures that we do not have access to the users’ unencrypted keys. Furthermore, our systems maintain multiple layers of replication and backup to ensure service continuity. During the outage, our customers were able to restore their wallets directly onto other Bitcoin clients, such as Multibit. Transactions and account balances were unaffected, because the customer funds are stored on the decentralized Bitcoin blockchain, not on our servers. Nevertheless, we recognize that this outage has caused concern and disrupted our customer’s use of the web wallet service, causing inconvenience. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience.
Today, Tuesday March 18th, Blockchain’s services are partially restored and we continue to work hard to restore full services. The Blockchain explorer functionality, which allows people to search in the Bitcoin blockchain has been restored. We are still restoring databases and rebuilding services in a phased approach. Over the next 72 hours, we anticipate all services will return to normal, though we hope to have many restored much sooner than that. We are also adding new servers to support the higher-than-usual traffic we anticipate as services are restored. If you need urgent access to your funds, please follow the instructions here to restore to a desktop client or send us a support request here, if you don’t have a backup of your wallet. You can access your funds independently of our service.
Rest assured, your funds are safe, your wallet backups are safe, our services will soon resume without any loss other than to our pride. After this incident is over, we will conduct a full review; we will publish more information about exactly what happened and lessons learned. We will continue to improve our infrastructure to ensure we are much more resilient in the future and are ready to serve our 1.4 million and fast growing user base. We appreciate your support and patience and we promise you that we are working as hard as possible, around the clock and around the globe to fulfill our responsibilities to our users.
Thank you for your support and patience,

We analyzed this bug and found that it if exploited, an attacker can cause a wallet to show incorrect balances. However, an attacker must spend bitcoin to do so. We have developed and tested a fix, which was part of the reason for the downtime. A full deployment of the fix will take up to three hours of maintenance mode, so we will deploy it during a time of day with less user activity. It does not allow user balances to be compromised or funds stolen. 
Blockchain routinely fixes security and other bugs via the CrowdCurity platform. Unfortunately, in this, we did not respond to the OP fast enough and our own internal training around escalating issues correctly from support was insufficient. We will reinforce this internally.
We apologize that CrowdCurity registration is offline at the moment, but in the meantime we invite anyone, including the OP, to email us at security with any security related concerns or information. 
Thanks for your understanding.

It's definitely frustrating, and I completely understand. I live off of bitcoin as much as possible (my paychecks have been 100% bitcoin for over a year now), and I also use Blockchain wallets for making purchases online &amp; in person. We always encourage users to keep their wallet backups safe and secure offline. This could be in pdf paper form, or an encrypted wallet.aes.json file. This way you always have access to your funds, even in the event of something like this that forces us to take the site down for maintenance.

As a reminder, never click on a third party link to access your wallet. Even if you're 100% sure it's from us I'd still advise you to get in the practice of avoiding 3rd party links. It's the safest way to avoid these types of phishing sites.

Mandrik with Blockchain.info here. I've heard of this scam before, and it's quite unfortunate that it happens. Watch Only addresses are one of my favorite features of our site. It's great for sending from paper wallets, keeping an eye on addresses, transactions, etc. As much as I don't want these scams to happen I'm not quite sure what else can be done to prevent this. The idea that immediately comes to mind is not including a Watch Only address in the total balance, but many people want to see this in their balance. I hope people take the proper precautions before buying bitcoins from someone. Being a careful, informed buyer is the most important part of this process.
By the way, blockchain.zendesk.com is the easiest way to contact us in the future. I look at tickets all day, every day. They don't even let me out until I'm done all my work, and even then it's just to cook everyone dinner. ;(

The backup will contain whatever public/private keys that were in it at the time the backup was generated. It is also decrypted with whatever password you were using at the time of the backup. So if you didn't create any new keys since the time that backup was created, and you know the password to decrypt the wallet, then you should be able to access whatever funds are in the wallet.

Here's the latest update pulled from our blog:
On Monday March 17th, Blockchain services experienced a series of technical issues that originated from a database error and resulted in suspension of services. The issue was entirely unrelated to the earlier problems with the SharedCoin service; it was simply a timing coincidence. This was not the result of hacking or attacks, or of any suspicious activity. It was simply the result of an obscure bug and a combination of technical factors that expressed this bug under heavy load.
For those tech savvy people, the specific problem that caused our database cluster to crash was MySQL Error code 625 and 2352. The error in our database affected several tables, across several replicated copies of our database system, specifically those tracking information that is also contained in the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. We were able to diagnose the problem quickly, but because of the very large size of the data sets and the extent of the problem, the fix was not easy. The two specific error codes are only sparsely documented on the web. We decided to pursue multiple methods to try to fix the problem, including re-compiling a custom version of MySQL to get around the error, while simultaneously restoring databases from our backup systems onto new servers. Because of the large dataset, each step in testing, restoring or copying data can take a very long time, making the entire process slow.
A few important facts: at no time were the customer funds or wallets at risk of theft or loss. Blockchain’s architecture ensures that we do not have access to the users’ unencrypted keys. Furthermore, our systems maintain multiple layers of replication and backup to ensure service continuity. During the outage, our customers were able to restore their wallets directly onto other Bitcoin clients, such as Multibit. Transactions and account balances were unaffected, because the customer funds are stored on the decentralized Bitcoin blockchain, not on our servers. Nevertheless, we recognize that this outage has caused concern and disrupted our customer’s use of the web wallet service, causing inconvenience. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience.
Today, Tuesday March 18th, Blockchain’s services are partially restored and we continue to work hard to restore full services. The Blockchain explorer functionality, which allows people to search in the Bitcoin blockchain has been restored. We are still restoring databases and rebuilding services in a phased approach. Over the next 72 hours, we anticipate all services will return to normal, though we hope to have many restored much sooner than that. We are also adding new servers to support the higher-than-usual traffic we anticipate as services are restored. If you need urgent access to your funds, please follow the instructions here to restore to a desktop client or send us a support request here, if you don’t have a backup of your wallet. You can access your funds independently of our service.
Rest assured, your funds are safe, your wallet backups are safe, our services will soon resume without any loss other than to our pride. After this incident is over, we will conduct a full review; we will publish more information about exactly what happened and lessons learned. We will continue to improve our infrastructure to ensure we are much more resilient in the future and are ready to serve our 1.4 million and fast growing user base. We appreciate your support and patience and we promise you that we are working as hard as possible, around the clock and around the globe to fulfill our responsibilities to our users.
Thank you for your support and patience,
Blockchain Team

Please avoid using url shorteners, especially for something like this.
@_date: 2014-12-06 21:34:59
When an address is generated client-side in a Blockchain.info wallet the wallet syncs with the server, and an updated encrypted wallet backup is immediately sent. If there is a problem connecting to the Blockchain.info server (intermittent internet connection is usually the most common reason) then you will see an error message saying the server failed to sync.
It's very difficult to say what exactly happened here without first hand observation, but I can certainly understand why you feel frustrated.

Hey there! If you don't have a secondary password, or the secondary password mnemonic, then there isn't much that can do to access the funds from the most recent version of the wallet. What I can do is send you all the wallet backups, and you could try importing/decrypting the most recent version of the wallet that *didn't* have second password enabled. This will work, assuming you have the correct main password for this wallet version. The downside is it will only contain the keys that were in it at the time the wallet backup was created.

Hey Frank99123, 
Blockchain.info has grown a lot over the past few years. We were one of the first companies to build a wallet that’s web-assisted and doesn’t control private keys. Have we experienced growing pains? Absolutely. We’ve always worked to fix any issues in a responsible and timely manner. When mistakes were made, we owned up to them with public security disclosures, and worked hard to make things right for our users -- not because it was easy, but because it was the right thing to do. It should be noted that we regularly deal with very sophisticated DoS attacks, phishing attempts, and social engineering efforts, and do everything we can to keep our users and their funds safe. Most of the time, no one sees the results of those efforts, and that’s fine. 
Many teams don’t have the resources to provide great user support, but we answer all cases within a 2.5-hour average. Whether you’re new to bitcoin or a longtime Blockchain.info user, we do our best to answer all questions asked of us. User privacy has been one of the core foundations of our Company. We believe in open networks and open access for all. That’s why when you sign up for a wallet at Blockchain.info, the only requirement is a strong password with the option to add an email address. As we’re constantly growing, we’ve been listening to the global bitcoin community and making improvements. In fact, we’ve built a new HD wallet from the ground up that will be more secure and easier to use than ever before and released over the next few weeks. If you are ever having an issue, you can hit us up on Twitter  or on our official support page at blockchain.zendesk.com
Welcome to bitcoin either way! If you're interested in some swag send us a DM and we'll be glad to drop something in the mail for you!

Blockchain.info friendly robots reporting for duty! We're happy to help :)
Sweeping your private key from a piece of paper should be a breeze. 
You'll need to set up a wallet first (make a strong password!) 
We have a ton of tutorials too we've written up over the years so here's a great place to start:

Hi Everyone- 
That application was not made by Blockchain.info. It was made by someone named Joseph Page from La Jolla California.  We haven't attempted to register the mark "Blockchain" and don't have any intention to do so. 
If you'd like to verify, you can read the content at this link: 
 
Blockchain Luxembourg S.a.r.l is our corporate entity as on our certificate. 
We've been contacted by a lot of entities named Blockchain, Bitcoin, etc from around the world so it is our guess there are quite a few out there. 
Thanks,

Blockchain.info has never dealt in anything but bitcoins, and we have never operated an exchange where we bought and sold them to customers. Yes, we linked to many different services, like Barclays Pingit and BitInstant. We still link to Bitstamp. When you access these links you are taken to their sites, and whatever happens after that point is out of the hands of blockchain.info. I'm sorry to hear that you still have an outstanding issue. I want you to get your funds back, and that's why I'm encouraging you to reach out to whoever it is you did a direct bank transfer with. I sincerely hope it can get resolved asap.

Two factor authentication via Google Authenticator all the way! Just click on "Security" under "Account Settings" to enable it. A second password to encrypt the private keys is never a bad idea either, but keep in mind it is more to remember. ;)
Always note your password mnemonic, too. If you ever update the password (and I hope it's a complicated one!), then be sure to note the new mnemonic that generates.
Thanks for using Blockchain.info!

This page is a product of Blockchain.info, but the site itself is still in testing. That's why it redirects you to your Blockchain.info wallet login page. When it's 100% functional we'll spread the word. :)

Woo hoo! Glad I could help!

Hi folks! I'm Mandrik with Blockchain.info. If for some reason you aren't receiving SMS notifications, then please let me know via blockchain.zendesk.com. PM'ing Piuk on the bitcointalk forums isn't the best way to try to get a hold of us, but opening a ticket is! I'm on these all day, every day.
I always recommend people use Google Authenticator for their wallets. It's free and it works offline. You could look into purchasing a Yubikey, too. If you ever lose access to any of this, then you can submit a 2FA reset request. It should be approved or denied within 24 hours tops.
By the way, the people who work at Blockchain.info are a very tight-knit group. We only hire individuals we can trust 100%. We're all very much into bitcoin, and we want to see it continue to grow. That's our focus!

Blockchain.info isn't an exchange, and never deals in anything but bitcoins. We offer a free wallet service, and we keep track of the actual bitcoin blockchain. If you did a transaction with an exchange, but never received the funds, then I'd encourage you to reach out to them. Hope you can get your situation straightened out!

Let me know the exact Blockchain.info shared address you sent the funds to, and reference this Reddit post for good measure.

This is aimed at new wallet creation. We wanted to celebrate the 500,000th wallet  by giving away 10 bitcoins. Maybe this will be someone just trying to win the contest, or maybe it'll be a new user setting up his/her first bitcoin wallet. I'm sure we'll see a bump in wallet creations because of this contest, but we were only a day or two away from the 500k goal before this announcement.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:14:46
Don't worry, I'll be back in the near future. It's fun to talk bitcoin, but seeing people bringing their ideas to life is what it's all about. I saw a lot of that tonight. I just wish I had time to meet everyone.

@_date: 2013-12-27 01:33:20
It was literally the only way to track down the identifier. After I did find it I immediately told him to get the funds out of that wallet, and never use those addresses again.
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:17:40
I posted this on the forum, but I'll post it here, too.
We're extremely limited in what we can do for issues involving passwords not working. We can help track down lost identifiers, reset two factor authentication &amp; IP locks, and even provide a history of backups for a user's wallet. Unfortunately if the password does not work then there is nothing more we can do. We have the lost password mnemonic page ( Whenever a password is changed by a user they need to make sure to note the new mnemonic. Otherwise the old password will still display when you enter the old mnemonic in. We certainly don't want people to lose access to their funds, so we try to offer as many backup plans as possible.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:26:09
From Piuk:
Congratulations, you have discovered an obscure bug in the iphone app!
The issue is you have added a transaction note which contains a newline character. When the wallet is saved this is not properly escaped causing the json produced to be invalid. The iPhone app has not been updated since the notes feature was added so this was never tested.
Using the wallet details provided on zendesk I have restored the missing address (0.5 BTC) and deleted the offending note + added a 0.1 BTC bug bounty. So you should now be able to login again through the web interface and iphone app again.
The bug will be fixed next update.
I'm glad this is sorted out! Thank you so much for your patience. I know not being able to access your funds is extremely frustrating.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:40:38
And we're back. :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:58:23
FYI - this is not a wallet app created &amp; supported by Blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:09:11
Per Piuk:
Turns out it was an issues with BTC-e chat messages not being sanitised correctly if using html encoded entities. Should be resolved now and wallet users need not worry.
@_date: 2013-11-01 00:51:24
