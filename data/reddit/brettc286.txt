Always have two ways to recover the coins.
For Trezor and ledger, this means keeping your seed in one place, and the hardware/ device in another. That way on theif or fire can't get both.
For paper wallet, print two identical ones.  Put both of them in safe, but separate places.  And put them in something water proof (like a ziplock bag).  Water is the biggest threat to a paper wallet.

Great job explaining Bitcoin, I'm sharing with my Indian friends. :)
@_date: 2015-12-26 03:49:58
good call, then the paper wallet isn't just twice as easy to find and steal.  You'd have to find two of them.

If "long term" to you means 1 year, then yes, there has been a decline.  But look at the value on a range of 3+ years, it looks very different.
And I don't know what you mean about the price continuing to drop, it's been hovering around ~$230 for many months.
@_date: 2015-12-14 01:22:29
The hardware needed isn't cheap, especially if you want it to work for more than 6 months.  As the storage needs to handle the growing blockchain and enough RAM in case we implement BIP-101.
@_date: 2015-12-19 23:04:13
Actually, getting a hold of the Trezor and/or the backup is still fine, because you should have set a pin.  And incorrect guesses on the pin cause an incremental back off on retries.  This means the second attempt will be 8s later, the third 16s and so on.  So a brute force attempt would take years.  By then, you should have recovered your coins on a new Trezor and moved them.
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:08:02
I don't understand what that graph is depicting.  He's talking about 2016 but the graph spans Oct '13 &gt;&gt; July '14.  And that's definitely NOT the price graph for that time period.

I agree that taking on the responsibility yourself introduces it's own issues.  I think with time, hardware wallets will get cheaper, simpler, and more secure.  Then solutions like Trevor will be a no-brainer.  Right now, the price point is too high for me as well, and if I was not a programmer/Linux enthusiast, I would ALSO just leave all my coins on coinbase.

For an "average person". Just setup a coinbase account and have some fun with Bitcoin.  For me, it was when I had over 1K invested into Bitcoin that I started thinking much more about securing it.  AND coinbase can help generate your first printed cold storage, so don't fret :)

more of a way to promote bitcoin than anything =)  I'm sure it will be for more "random" use.
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:48:25
My cousin was one of the original ( and non-techie ) bitcoin supporters.  He's also a professional figher and loves showing off things that he cares about.  So I think he'll enjoy this =)
*EDIT* I removed the bitcoin address to adhear to the bitcoin subredit rules.  I wasn't asking for donations, just showing that the hoodie is functional =)
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:26:46
not saying it's a bad idea, but it was not the purpose of the hoodie ;)
Also keep in mind that many Anti-Bitcoin folks use the currency's usefulness in illegal activity as a reason to try and discourage people from using it.  I believe this is a logical fallacy, and as you stated, they are already using fiat money in hand to accomplish the same thing.  But none-the-less, it's something that is being used to discredit bitcoin.  just a thought =)

It would increase the use and demand of bitcoin?  Keep in mind, I'm not speaking in terms of my own actions alone.  Just thinking if my habits could be detrimental to bitcoin if those habits were shared by everyone else.  IE: Should I promote, or discourage these habits in others.

yeah I've seen bigger rigs for $75 that can do way more.  Honestly I wanted to try this thing out in a physically smaller way, not devote a whole table and extra power supply to the mining rig.  I'm not saying I'm going about this in the smartest way, just trying it out and having a little fun =)
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:27:45
hehe, true.  This is also the case for any donation address, and is the general nature of bitcoin.  It doesn't really bother me, I hope it doesn't bother him.

Thanks for the info!  I actually better secured my bitcoins ( or more accurately: my private keys ;) this morning by switching from a wallet on my gaming pc (only used for gaming &amp; browsing but still gets malware every month or so.  "Fucking windows" indeed. ) TO a dedicated Raspberry pi running raspbian and using an electrum wallet.  This pi will only be used for sending BTC, and will not be booted otherwise.  I know it's not as good as legit cold storage, but I think it dramatically reduces my risks.   Maybe this idea could help someone, it was really simple to setup.  Cheers!
@_date: 2015-05-29 02:46:27
Just setup a coinbase or circle account, buy some coin and have some fun.  Don't worry about security or price volatility yet, it won't really affect you at the tiny level that you plan to spend.

I was actually going to suggest coinbase.  Try their "vault" functionality, I hear they store those offline.  
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:20:53
it all depends on how much you believe in the currency.  ANY relative low point is a great time to buy if you believe that it will eventually be exponentially higher.

For me, it's not.  I use a raspberry pi for my "warm" storage.  ( I only boot it up if I want to send funds from my savings, which is rare ). And use coinbase for pocket money.  I like the $35 price point of a raspberry pi a lot better :P.  But that's not for everyone.

It's hard to fix someone else's website in a user-friendly way.  But if you open up the javascript console, and paste in this line, and hit enter.  It will quick-fix this issue.
In Firefox: Tools &gt;&gt; Web Developer &gt;&gt; Web Console
In Chrome: Tools &gt;&gt; JavaScript Console
For blockchain.info homepage:
    $(' overflow: 'auto'});
For blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions ( so you can access the pagination buttons / footer at the bottom):
    $(' overflow: 'auto'});

-----DISCLAIMER BELOW-----
BTCXINDIA CLOSING
Dear Customer,
We regret to inform you that BTCXIndia is closing down it's bitcoin trading platform as of 20th of May 2015.
We have today been informed by our bank that they will no longer serve bitcoin businesses. We have investigated the possibility to operate through other banks, but it seems this is a general policy in India as of today.
Without a bank account, we can no longer operate as a business and we are thus forced to close operations.
BTCXIndia launched in May 2014 with the aim to offer a regulatory compliant trading platform, and have since served customers without any issues. We have been in close contact with banks and authorities to ensure we are as legally compliant as possible in a new industry, and today's news comes as a big shock to us all.
Business will conduct as normal until 20th of May, and we urge customers to withdraw all funds before this date. BTCXIndia apologises for bringing you these news, but the decision has been made is outside of our control.
Once the regulatory situation has become clear in India, we hope to once again open for trading. Until then, we would like to thank you for your business and support.

You want to buy art with Bitcoin? Or sell art with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-30 02:48:59
To those concerned about this painting being a "re-imagining" of a different painting.  I want you to know that [derivative work]( is not uncommon in the art community.
My wife ( who's name is Emily by the way, I'll just use her name from now on ), was not trying to "scam" anyone or misrepresent herself.  She was simply trying to make art that this community might like.
I am a bitcoin enthusiast and I encouraged her to make some art for the community.  There was thought put into the [Art Nouveau]( style that she wanted to use in this series.  She chose it to reflect the technological revolution that Bitcoin is helping to create, which is similar to the technological change and lifestyle revolutions happening in the late 1800's.
I think Bitcoin should be inclusive, not exclusive.  I'd like to thank those who have offered encouragement, and ask those who have not to think about what kind of community we want here.
@_date: 2015-08-03 02:58:12
I wonder if you could obscure it in a clever way.  A thick layer of wax maybe?
@_date: 2015-08-29 14:19:04
Yes! It is inspired by his work, and Art Nouvau in general.  Which I think is mentioned on the page with the painting.  She plans to continue with more seasons :)
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:34:52
I think he's holding up his money.  Or hodling?  No, holding in this context.
Anyway, you see what you want to see ;)  Not unlike [hearing what you want to hear.](
@_date: 2015-08-29 14:57:25
She's updating the webpage to mention this right now :)
Edit: the information added to the page reads:
Special Note: This work is a reimagining of [The Rose]( by beloved art nouveau painter, [Alphonse Mucha]( (I have no doubt it is a parallel piece to his [seasons series]( His version incorporates a more muted, Spring-like pallet of colors. Here the figure is in a slightly larger space with more vibrant colors, reflective of the energy and possibilities of Bitcoin.

Yes, this is exactly what a trezor does for you.  If you can spend the money, trezor is the way to go.  But this is a great tutorial on how to do it for free with existing equipment. You could do this with an offline raspberry pi and only spend around $30
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:08:06
That's how I can interpreted it too, I don't see that as a major flaw.  And it's just a side effect of the fact that no one person/entity gets to call veto on code changes, Instead the majority of miners define what code is used.
@_date: 2015-08-09 01:50:25
I didn't know Bitcoin ATMs require IDs / any personal information.  Are you sure this is common?
@_date: 2015-08-03 03:03:52
Seems pretty good, I went up to the QR code.  I'm assuming from there it confirms your payment and the deal is done.
If you're having to re-invent the wheel here, and it becomes hard to maintain:  Services from bitpay or coinbase are great options.  Or stripe if you want a little more control over the UX.
@_date: 2015-08-17 22:53:47
You might as well assume no Windows system is safe.  I'd trust Microsoft and the NSA more than those who wrote the virus currently living on your PC.
I always suggest web wallets or Trezor to windows users.  Then I tell them how cool Ubuntu is ;)

I actually considered starting to run a full node on [censored altcoin], just to do my part to move all this shit forward.
@_date: 2015-08-31 21:27:20
My wife and I are working on [this](
We haven't found a good printer to make prints and accept Bitcoin.  So we're only selling originals via Bitcoin.
Bitpay is great for this, however let me warn you.  Until you do several optional steps, there is a limit of $100 value per purchase, that they barely tell you about.  We were able to create buy now buttons for 2BTC each with no warnings or messages.  Then we lost two sales because of the maximum value limit.  And they don't even log the user info on the failed purchases, so you're SOL.
Good luck, and let me know if you find a good print service that accepts Bitcoin.
Also beware, the Bitcoin community is not the art community.  We encountered a lot of aggression here, which surprised me.

Special Note: This work is a reimagining of [The Rose]( by beloved art nouveau painter, [Alphonse Mucha]( (I have no doubt it is a parallel piece to his [seasons series]( His version incorporates a more muted, Spring-like pallet of colors. Here the figure is in a slightly larger space with more vibrant colors, reflective of the energy and possibilities of Bitcoin.

Small works on this are fairly easy to ship safely because they can be well protected, and they are very small and light.  Since it's acrylic, it's very durable in high temperatures.

For accepting payments, you can request money be sent directly to your wallet, or use services like bitpay, coinbase, or stripe to accept payments in a more automated fashion, and choose if you want to receive Bitcoin or fiat money from the transaction (Instant conversion from BTC &gt; USD)
If you plan to hold large amounts of Bitcoin to act as your own bank / savings.  I suggest getting a trezor.
For day to day spending of Bitcoin, I suggest a mobile app like breadwallet or mycelium.  These apps are great because you own the coins and the private keys and don't rely on 3rd party servers.  However, I use these as pocket money, not my entire savings.  For that, the trezor or paper wallets in a safe are the way to go.
@_date: 2015-08-29 14:55:10

If you think about the financial services that a bank provides in modern culture, and how you could not easily operate without a bank account.  (Getting paid wages, buying things online, paying bills, etc. ). For these things you need a checking account, a credit card, a safe place to store your money, and that's what a bank provides.
Bitcoin can do all this too, and that's the purpose of a Bitcoin wallet.  Also wallets are free, and can be setup by anyone with a smartphone or a computer without requiring any personal information.  They give the user the ability to take full control of their finances, and not require a bank.  This means that no-one can seize your funds, or block your transactions.  Because you are your own bank. ;)

no, both are vertically centered in the area.  It's just that the word 'bitcoin' is very bottom-heavy, so it sits a little low.

Why not just use Bitcoin at very small amounts?  Then they can play with the exact same tools and services they normally would.  And there's no setup. Example: 20 bits

You can also use it on a chrome book now, since they added chrome integration.  I love my trezor, and trust it to hold my savings.  It's just pretty expensive for just 2 coins.  I invested in it once I had about 8 coins.

This would be my suggestion.  Help her setup a coinbase account, and show her the vault feature.  Then install the app on her phone and she can easily buy bitcoin whenever she wants, and send it to the vault.
I personally don't want my coins in a 3rd party's control, because I'm tech savvy and I trust myself more than them.
But in your case, you DON'T trust your mother to take care of it, so let coinbase do it for her.  So far, coinbase has been really good about refunding coins lost as result of a bug or security breach.
People hate on coinbase because you don't possess the coins, and because they regulate what you can use them on.  ( account might be suspended if you buy things off the dark net using coinbase wallet ).  But I don't think these things will matter to your Mom.
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:50:34
Most people don't run the node on the same machine as their wallet.  But even if you did, I'm not aware of a security risk.

Agreed.  The issue here is that her records and the store's records showed two different things.  With Bitcoin, this would be impossible.
@_date: 2015-07-12 14:54:26
I mildly agree.  For a noob with just one or two bitcoins, coin base is great.  Use their vault feature for your savings.
However, for a noob with 5+ bitcoins. Buy a trezor.  It's also super easy, and WAY more secure.

Phone lines are inefficient.  It would be nice to have I guess, but if I worked for coinbase, I'd advise against it.  As long as their response times are within ~12 hours, I think the support portal is fine.

The "coins" aren't on your hard drive.  Instead you have proof that you own "a" wallet.  The contents of that wallet are determined from the blockchain.

A "large portion" is a "large portion".  I don't see why it would be better or worse based on his net wealth.
To counter your point, someone with low net worth ( and allocating a "large portion" of it in bitcoin ) would lose much less money if bitcoin failed than someone with a large net worth.
IMO the amount it impacts you is based on the percentage of your net worth you put into it, not what your net worth is.

Some will will argue that the Bitcoin Blockchain is "The Blockchain", while others would be "A Blockchain".
Like a lot of things, it's determined by consensus, but I feel like that consensus is met when one thing is overwhelmingly more popular than the others.  The Internet is "The" because it's the main one, the most popular one.  Even though technologically it's not much different from an intranet.
I think Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Blockchain is still too young for there to be an overwhelming consensus that the Bitcoin Blockchain is "The Blockchain", but I think it is, and I think we'll all agree 5 years from now.

Understood, but we're not talking about selling shoes.  These are pieces of art.  The value is subject to opinion, not just overhead.
I think your point is still valid though, just saying the type of product being sold here is more flexible in terms of price.
The thought here is that if you can increase excitement in the piece of art simply by the logic behind the pricing, it might be worth doing.  ( since these are bitcoin themed paintings, I was wanting to gauge how much the bitcoin-based pricing would excite the community )

Nope, BTC can be sent directly to a paper wallet, just as easily as a live/hot wallet.  But are treated the same in the network.
Just make it easy on everyone and print out the QR code for your public address.  The other person can just scan it  with their phone, and send you BTC.

Hey guys, the look and animation in the editor is really fun.  But I have no idea what I'm looking at.  01 02 OP_ADD.  There is no explanation to what this means, or what changes I can/should try to make.  I'm a full-time programmer =P - and I have no idea what is going on here.

Obvious follow up questions: how much? Do you have an online store?

hehe, good idea.  I once put my freelance company logo on my credit card.  This is cooler because it promotes bitcoin.  But I wonder if people will be disappointed when they ask about it and you say you're not really using bitcoin. :P

Those are not the same porportions.  One is 0.5% and one is 50%

I find it hard to believe that these companies have enough cash to hold all profits for 2 years.

I wonder if there ever was a private key! Post it for proof!!
