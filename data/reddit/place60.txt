I would add my 1 btc to it. Where do I send it to?

it's like a lotto. i'm traveling over 3 weeks now all over europe, changing hotels every 3-4 days. All booked through expedia + bitcoin. no problems at all. I've made 6 or 7 reservations already and everything is going fine.The price's a bit higher due to coinbase fee and exchange rates, but overall experience is ok.

Yep. lets make one like it?

What that site is about? Is it like LBC? or what? 3 pages open to public without registration? And they aren't really explain anything.. really? Who is this site is operated by? what are the terms of service? How it secures our BTC? Is there any 2FA for the least?
Don't think I will ever use it. LBC, PAxum or any other that is much more open and transparent about itself and tech it uses. But surely not one like the one You are promoting..

It's just a matter of time when someone out of china will create a service allowing them to keep using BTC. so it's no dead yet.
