Is havelock a problem? I am not understanding the IPO on there either.

I will not take all the money. I will be keeping everyone updated each week through the spreadsheet. I know a lot of people have been ripped off and lied to within BTC. I am trying to be very transparent here and just give a option to some people to maybe instead of just sitting on their BTC but allow it to make you some extra as well. I used to just sit on mine and took a long time to finally find a way to invest it. Once that was found then I did heavy research into the funds and contacted the fund owners. 
If you want more insurance, how about this. At the end of any of the three months you would like out then your shares can be sold and you can take your total earnings as well.

I do not have a passport. I have never been out of the country of the US. I am not planning on getting a passport anytime soon. I have no reason to leave the country. I will talk to you though in a skype call.

True, I did forget. My name is Adam. Trust side, I am a US citizen and I will be using my personal email for this so if I just run off with the BTC then you can sue me. My personal Email has my name in it. I will be investing on Havelock Investments.

This will not be a true stock. You will still get the percent of the dividends made and once sold you will get back whatever your shares make at sell. It is gambling as you may put in 0.1 and gain some or loose some. The actual fun we would be investing in has put in place if it it hits a point of not profitable then the fund own will buy back all shares at market value.
