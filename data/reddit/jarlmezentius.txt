Try GYFT.com, I sometimes use them to buy Amazon gift cards and get what I need, within moments, without the need of converting through a 3 day wait to deposit USD my bank.
There's also tons of small start-ups like:
that's just a brief tour through my last 6 hours browser history.

Put in "I don't Know - Bitcoin is Anonymous!" and hit Send. After a few of those, they might get the hint.

"Several" as in several tries or several Bitcoin... If it's more than a set amount, like above the banking industries reporting requirements for $$$... then I might see this happening.
Even then what's to stop you from lying?
or putting in something like "Bribe Money for Senator ButtKiss to vote YES on the Banking Industry Before Bitcoin Bill."

good point. I wonder if  they are so over burdened with converting their bitcoin to their other "Secret Currency" that they don't have time to check e-mails, tweets, facebook pokes, reddit threads, etc.

There is one Wordpress plugin already available for woocommerce and wordpress describing exactly what you're talking about... you can use either your own wallet address through the blockchain.info API, or your Electrum wallet's Master Public Key for receiving your bitcoins.
The plugin also uses blockchain API to do fiat~bitcoin price conversions as well, so you mat use your local pricing for ease of use for your website visitors.
The plugin is free from the wordpress repo at

Besides ironic and counter-theoretical to the concept of bank-free anonymity, this will be prohibitive, punitive and unpopular.

While historic city-state and national currencies and other forms of fiat have historically ended up supporting and funding wars, Bitcoin encourages peaceful transactions, not forceful ones.

A lot of work went into this site ... This is a serious effort by Bit*Jane to raise awareness of the economy of BitCoin in the general market place.
Redditors already are aware of BitCoin (Otherwise you wouldn't be here) and, this site is mostly for the general public, but today is a good day to come join the fun, win prizes, etc.

Actually it's quite possible as a 'broker' does this every day with 'Brokerage Accounts' they trade with in the markets.
