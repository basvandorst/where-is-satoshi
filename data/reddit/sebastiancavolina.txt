It means that every single unit of a thing is interchangeable for any other unit of the same kind without any effect on its original value or utility. That's something bitcoin doesn't do, as every single coin has a history, and having a history means 1 btc is not equal to 1 btc, as the two of them might have an entirely different history. It may not affect the majority of the coin's functions, but there are some things, like some exchanges for example, that will sometimes blacklist that specific coin and ban/block/freeze every account that has had it in its possesion, depending on that coin's history, and wether or not they have control over that wallet or account that contains it, but thats besides the point. 
TL;DR: Bitcoin is not ENTIRELY fungible since each bitcoin (aside from that coins id) is made different by its history alone.

Not really. It was just a small dip in price at first, but it triggered the auto-sell price drop protection for almost everyone who had it set up causing the rest of the drop

Either a silkroad address, CSW (lmao), some random early adopter who bought bitcoins for cents and then forgot they even had a wallet, or MtGox. There is no definitive proof, but considering the ammount of money and coins, narrowing it down to a few possibilities is a pretty crazy approximation.

Geez, unbelievable how many people dont get this. Yes, coinbase is a whale, but coinbase only affects coinbase, aside from buying/selling price changes, which are also not under their control (and just because they happen inside coinbase it does not mean that they control anything). 
Have an upvote, back to one you go.
(But srsly tho, whatever your opinion may be, we all agree that coinbase is a cunt)

Haha yes it was. Before they went full on electoral fraud mode, they threatened poor people who were already dependant on government supplies with not giving them their monthly food rations (CLAP boxes) if they voted against PSUV (partido socialista unido de Venezuela/ venezuelan united socialist party). 
They also threatened those unqualified public workers they put on those positions, with firing them if they didn't vote for them or if they didn't go to the party's events and public gatherings. 
The one time information about this got out, it was called "the Tascon List". But it's still happening. 
They made them dependant, and then used threats about taking away such privileges. Obviously giving goods for free is part of why we are so screwed now. 
I know this is a fact, because my GF's mom works at an office at the public health ministry, and she has been forced to attend those things. She is one of the few actually qualified people that keep this country afloat.

It's all a part of the socialist corrupt money machine.
Hugo Chavez introduced an exchange control on the trading of USD and EUR back when he first got in office. Ex-president of Argentina Cristina Kirchner did it too with their DollarBlue policy. Now, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO), seeing as venezuela uses LocalBitcoins as an escape to the government policies, wants to block that too. 
Kirchner and the government of Venezuela used to be friends. Beware of those who say they're doing "good for the people", because they only mean "good for their own pockets."

Haha yeah i know. Just 4 da meemz. I'm an ASIC maintenance guy. I just take out the fans, use a brush to loosen the dust and vacuum it afterwards, and reboot them if they have issues. I also create the repair tickets if any hashboard is malfunctioning or the control board dies or i buy the fans when they stop sending RPM to the board.

Not really. You know what's actually frustrating? angsty Starbucks-drinking socialist teens. They think they know everything because "capitalism is bad". 
Like, STFU, Panama became a thiving economy once they butt-fucked Noriega. Trump is an asshole, but if he'll do something about this shit, I'll gladly lick dog poop off of his shoes. 
Just to give you an image of how bad this shit is and how few people can have a pretty normal life, we are one of those few, and i had to give away like 48 eggs, corn flour packets, corn starch, milk, rice, and other shit to my GF's best friend, because they were barely making it by eating lentils, rice and arepas, everyday, 3 times a day, for more than two months. And when the blackout ocurred, they weren't able to buy shit, since there was no subway and she had no markets or grocery stores nearby. And they survive off of weekly income, as in, buy shit to eat everyday. The blackout really fucked up their "get money, spend it all on food, eat the food, repeat" cycle. 
And dont get me wrong, we (as in, only my family, and a few other venezuelans) dont live in poor conditions. But those eggs set us back a bit. Even though we have stuff, our budget is very unflexible. Those were our eggs for like two weeks. We cannot buy more till then. It's a minor inconvenience for us, and we were supposed to be a "high class" (in quotes, because even though we're supposed to be, we're performing like a middle class family) household, imagine what its like for those who earn minimum wage. 
Even "rich" people suffer the effects. Unless you earn dollars, your hands are tied. And everyone knows there are no dollars available to the public.
Hell, people are even saving up on Bitcoin, the most volatile assent in the past decade, just to escape inflation. We're all walking on a tight rope and some people act like that's not even happening. 
Oh, right, but I'm a CIA shill, i forgot, so you can ignore everything i just typed. 
Fuck communists, fuck socialists (except Bernie, he's different, ily Bern &lt;3) and fuck neo-liberal starbucks assholes. 
Edit: forgot to mention, I'm also banned on r/socialism for trying to motivate discussion by explaining why Guaidó is not self proclaimed, and why the government is illegal, with factual stuff, like how they bypassed the actual elected National Assembly, and handpicked their own party members for a new one without a legit voting process like its supposed to be, according to the constitution, etc.

You can also use LocalBitcoins.com, their KYC is reeeeeeally not restrictive. I live in venezuela and they only requested a picture of my ID which in my country is just a piece of paper with a hard plastic film covering it on both sides. Cheap as fuck and if someone wanted to make a counterfeit it would be the easiest to make. The newer versions just have watermarks on the plastic cover, still not hard to counterfeit. And they didn't ask for anything else. Its only function is fiat to btc, and btc to fiat.

You shouldn't buy when it goes up. That's a dumb move. Buy when it dips, sell when it goes up. You bought when it was already up and the price had mantained for DAYS, that's when you gotta sell, not buy. If you are expecting some kind of rocketing price going to the moon you should wat till next year when the halvening occurs. Your complaints will do nothing except serve as a deterrent for people to adopt bitcoin which will just hurt everyone. What i suggest, is buy NOW, everything you sold and KEEP IT until you make a profit. Otherwise you are just an ignorant loser.
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:45:45
You are wrong. The story you're telling implies everyone is honest and the money is there. Venezuelan government will just steal everything.

Threaten to take legal action. They usually start moving when you do. When POLONIEX started behaving shadily and denied users from withdrawing their funds because of things like this, you threatened with legal action and the next day your BTC are safe in your other wallet. These backstabbing exchanges are most likely pushing external entities to investigate wallets with large balances in order to try and have a chance at seizing your funds. The scary part comes when they try to do it to someone like me who lives in Venezuela who can do nothing about it.

Because theres no way to get Bolivares as easily as you can get them with btc. He only exchanges what's necessary and we have everything really budgeted. We never exchange more than what's strictly necessary. Period.
Edit: didn't actually explain. What he's thinking of doing, is putting it back into an exchange and trading it for a stablecoin.
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:27:24
Lmao you're right. They are just going in for the popularity of the thing. In Venezuela we mostly use Localbitcoins to exchange BTC and escape inflation in some way, and if you asked us, we would put on a confused puppy face and ask: "what the hell is litecoin?!?!"
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:32:59
Petro is "worth" 65 USD, but its a non-minable, pseudo-crypto "stablecoin", just like Tether, in the same way that 1 Tether "=" 1 USD, 1 Petro "=" 1 crude oil barrel. 
The thing is, you can't do shit with Petro because of all the international sanctions the country has, since it's considered as an extension of Venezuelas credit, which makes it practically useless almost anywhere.
They decided to "tie" the price to oil because sure as hell nobody will trust a crypto issued by the world's most corrupt government, and in order to give it some value, they needed something to "back it", which is also a lie, and it's not backed by anything.

We are not ruled by low inteligence people. Almost nobody is in support of those people since the past two presidential elections. Its all a fraud. There were massive protests in 2014, and since then people got paranoid and the protests never got as big as they got that time.
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:36:21
It is the solution, however, the government is one giant control freak, so running businesses solely based on it is risky since they labeled it as "illegal" and can get you in trouble. And with trouble i mean, getting imprisoned, with extra crimes you didn't commit, and possibly getting tortured to spill you Localbitcoins log-in info, which is then used to pay the extra salary to the government controlled thugs such as SEBIN or GNB.
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:47:50
Yes there is. We live in Venezuela, we use crypto to escape inflation. But i'm sure this will only last for a few days while the BCH hard fork thing figures itself out. He pulled out all our crypto from every exchange since they started manipulating in the 6000-7000 USD range. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:03:59
There are too many risks involved with that decision. Starting with the control freaks in government. If they realize you're doing business with crypto directly, they will most likely accuse you of market manipulation (in their words: "economic warfare") and use it as an excuse to throw you behind bars, where most likeky a corrupt officer will torture you untill you spill your Localbitcoins login info, which is then used to pay those same government thugs, which in turn motivates them to engage in this crypto-witch hunt  in an endless corruption cycle. It has happened before. And may god protect you if you have miners!

This is also a valid answer. Can you help me understand better?

For example, we sell BTC on Localbitcoins as if the price was around the 9000's in order to overcompensate for expected future inflation.

If that happens, then its nothing more than digitalized fiat. If you're talking about the Venezuelan crypto (petro) that's "backed" by gold, oil, and mineral reserves, you are wrong. Its just a national government approved bitconnect scam.
