That tipping also keeps people interested, however. Say I'm a normal person who hears about Dogecoin and checks out the subreddit. Without tipping I may look around, upvote a few things, leave a comment or two, and lose interest. With tipping, I get feedback on my contribution, and now I'm (in a tiny way) invested into the Dogecoin community. I'm a stakeholder, and far more likely to come back and check things out again.

It works but it's banned, so it won't post *verify* replies.

I wonder if this could be made in a way where they don't own the private keys. Maybe through multisig in some way where the user reserves a privately generated keyphrase?

Interestingly enough, if you hover that link in Chrome it just shows in the bottom left.

Correction: get the wallet, wait 3 days for the blockchain to download

Yeah I use Electrum but sadly most beginner tutorials seem to focus on the default wallet. It makes sense, but as the blockchain balloons I don't think everyone running a full node is really realistic.

The point isn't to cash it out, the point is they accumulate, you eventually end up with around 10k which you can buy some cool stuff with or donate to one of charity fundraisers or tip to someone else or something.
Of course only focuses on money money money so you don't see the point but it's fun, it's a community. It's a currency, not a commodity.

Performance reviews raise salaries through a top-down approach, tipping raises salaries bottom-up. Which do you think is more responsive, having a person's hard work slowly work its way up through a bureaucratic chain, or a customer giving them extra directly as a recognition that they did a good job?
I think tipping is great and I don't see why Reddit hates on it.

It's not about the monetary value, it's about having some coins. The average person doesn't look at 5 doge and say "wow, that's *a very small amount of money*", they see "oh hey that's 5 doge". Even if they do recognize it's not worth much they already know about Bitcoin's explosive growth and figure it will be worth something someday.

Nobody would have been 'forced', if customers wouldn't have liked it they could take their coins out of Flexcoin.

Why? If the intended method of transfer is tapping wallets together the actual address is an implementation detail.

And if Satoshi dumped all his coins that wouldn't affect the market at all?

Because every time someone dropped out, for a short time you would be making money. You would still make a profit, just in bursts of activity.

Well then AddzP's suggestion wouldn't work on that low-powered device either.

I agree, it doesn't really work out. But I think the original idea of bitcoins for wifi is good.

OP's suggestion basically works the same way if you set the price to something the user can mine while browsing. So they pay and then mine back the difference.

Better that the government does nothing than allowing it to do whatever it wants.

It's unlikely. However, if you were to go on to ask about buying things from SR on a pseudonymous aggregation site that logs your IP address, that could be traced back to you with some effort.

Considering she made $470,000 in Bitcoin more than you, she is obviously a better investor.


STOP. Give your sister all the remaining money. Admit you fucked up.
