Actually, that was one of the first categories I added to inventory! High-five for exercizing your rights as an American.

I added a real-time inventory display to count what the system is currently adding to inventory based on your power-searching.
It's added around 500 products in the last week:
"There are currently 4885 products in stock, available to ship immediately!"

How so?
I actually had Silk Road in mind when developing the backend systems running Chronocoin. I thought to myself, "If Bitcoin is going to REALLY succeed people need to able to buy toenail clippers, coffee, and hard drives more readily than drugs." 
Hence...Chronocoin is sort of designed to help Bitcoin overcome it's initially niche roots, whether you're talking about hyperspeculation during bubbles, the 'geek' stereotype, or the hype from things like SR.

You'll notice a lot of nice shiney high-resolution images have been added to the site, and we're now stocking almost 6,000 different products ready to ship immediately. 
Lots and lots of progress this month, but let me know if there's any other features you'd like to see. All feedback is welcome!

I decided to price match some random items to random retailers and see how Chronocoin stacks up for value:
Looks about even to me!

[Chronocoin is pretty cool]( since we are basically building our own mega-store but exclusively taking Bitcoin. Many of the items you'd be able to purchase on a site like [Amazon]( using your local currency on a credit card are now available for purchase using Bitcoin directly, whether from a smartphone or your desktop. 
Let me know what you think!
