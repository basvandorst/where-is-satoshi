Such an interesting opinion from a someone who wrote some C/C++ code 30 years ago with no economics degree. Does he understand fully how Bitcoin works?
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:41:13
In a few years this will be the other way around.

I kept closing Electron and going back into the wallet and it changed from "unconfirmed" to "low fee" back to unconfirmed and then it went away the last time.

The point of Bitcoin isn't to profit, it's to have a valuable currency in the future. Never sell back to USD.

Is this the "technical" term for this? I understand the issue with the idea just wanting a reference to more information on this kind of thing.

It isn't free. You just got the BCH coins when you got your BTC coins as they're essentially duplicates going forward in the chain.

@_date: 2017-08-04 06:00:52
You still should have known.
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:59:41
Neato Frito. What's your point?
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:43:47
They sell managing services for coins their customers explicitly purchased.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:27:07
So never consider selling then?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:06:32
Yes. People call Bitcoin Cash BCH because BCC is the ticket for another coin already.

That uint8_t*
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:47:54
By far, not the worst article I've read.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:39:27
Oh I know. I was just simplifying what you said.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:37:12
I knew I was going to get something wrong and get criticised. I was originally going to just do That char*
uint8_t bytes[4];
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:07:06
I agree. I find it odd how late it was but people should have know before that if they wanted their "free" coins. If you're going to own a digital currency it's your responsibility to keep up with it.
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:37:30
Separation of Currency and State!

Yeah sell if you think you have a chance to sell at a high rate before the price plummets from most people selling their BCH. If you think you can't then hodl and buy cheap coins.
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:18:15
I was just saying that as an example. I know that it isn't implicitly a byte
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:12:50
Why would you withdraw large amounts of BTC from an exchange intended for altcoins?
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:35:36
Not sure if these are comparable but I'll go with it for now.
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:16:41
HODL as opposed to sell, not spend.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:56:33
You haven't lost any money, fool.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:21:40
Not sure why you think selling isn't the best option when holding such a volatile asset.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:56:33
You haven't lost any money, fool.
