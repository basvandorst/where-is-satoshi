Well... It's funny, because I don't necessarily think that even if the current users are pretty well versed we are far along in adoption. We are early in it, individually interested in the tech, so we were more likely to develop a more developed understanding just out of fascination.
I think the tipping point for adoption will start when Bitcoin cards, with fingerprint scanners, are commonplace. Pick one up in a store for $20, put your info on somehow, use it worldwide in credit card scanners. May be a few years before that.

The issue there is that the coins are issued per block and a constant rate. That would need to be changed to reflect this if it happened.

I disagree with your speculation. At this stage, most or many people who own Bitcoin are familiar enough with how it works to know that not only does each service often entail a different wallet /private key, but also there are plenty of good reasons to have more than one personal wallet or brain wallet. I would estimate I am responsible for a half dozen addresses, offchain and thanks to companies like Coinbase, along with several private keys. I also don't think this is hugely unusual.
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:38:53
Very very cool! So what I assume this does is store your hashed information in a wallet, and by scanning a queried qr code yourself, the system can see that it is you through the blockchain and can log you in? Incredible. This will change everything in a few years... finally the era of remembering 50 different passwords for everything on the internet will be over. Amazing application of new technology to continue making all of life simpler, faster, and safer.

I think that Greece as a government and country will not adopt BTC, because the people in power already have their resources out of the borders and will just jump off the ship at the last second. They will refuse to find a deal, or at least so far they are... floundering "helplessly" while the main population is strangled.
That said, I think there are a lot of advantages to incite citizens of Greece to adopt BTC as part of a savings plan. To move whatever they have, if they still have anything, into it before the end of the month. It's their only way to buy a ticket off a ship. This may trigger a domino effect in Europe.

Interesting idea, I "like" it a lot. Once Bitcoin is valuable enough that even smaller amounts of bits can be sent back and forth without them being swallowed (on the order of less than a hundred satoshi) I could see things evolving this way.

If hoarding is what you are trying to do, the system described is not best for you. If the goal is supporting the isolated bitcoin economy through usage, this plan seems solid. You are right that a player is better off focusing on one or the other, I believe.

You want to use a cold storage method- there are several ways to do this.
Easy way- get a Trezor or Ledger wallet (hardware) to do the heavy lifting
Medium way- research and learn about brain wallets, and utilize them
Harder way- combination of above methods

Not sure why the downvotes here. Personal responsibility is a barrier of entry for Bitcoin, but as the system ages and as people become more familiar with the requirements for use (and the pros/cons of trusting third parties), I believe we will see change. 
It's not about ease of use. It's about opportunity. We can all choose to hold securely now, so long as a person does the research for themselves.

@_date: 2015-05-30 14:49:05
Not sure what you mean by premium. I personally have a ledger wallet, so I can speak to it- I wouldn't call it super durable, but if it gets destroyed it isn't as if the coins themselves are lost. You would be able to use recover your coins on any like device. The important part is that it is a way to securely hide a private key (and the projects are open source if you want to read more into that) while still having the coins somewhat accessible.
If you are of a mind where you won't be touching these coins at all for a decade or more, then those physical hardware solutions may not be best for you. Still good, but perhaps not best.

I know the romanticism of this idea drew me in when I was first starting- once I grasped the technology, the idea of being part of this "bitcoin millionaires" club was very appealing. I like it as an idea and a goal, but it's tough to convey that without people thinking poorly of the system. It does sound elitist and cultist.

I don't think so. Americanpegasus was downvoted earlier for saying so, but it is true (disclaimer: my opinion) that there are a mass of people who aren't interested or able to move the body of humanity forward. Rather than needing to weed out the half-baked contributions and using up time and resources, meeting and dividing ideas at the head by limited power and involvement makes good sense. 
The slippery slope begins not with representative democracy, but when money in the system and hidden agendas take information away from the people. When they are fed misinformation by the greater structures in their lives, even the well intentioned struggle to incite change.

Every block in the chain includes, in the input for it's hash, the hash of the block before it. Somehow losing block 3 or any other block would also change every block after it, and would change the entire chain.

I would absolutely say B, no question. We are very early in this, and that I think can be shown in the rhetoric used by mainstream sources. Right now we are only just approaching a stage where 'blockchain' is entering the public lexicon , and that comes with a flimsy and imperfect understanding of the underlying ideas.
This is normal for emergent technologies. 
One of the best parts about Bitcoin in my eyes is that any "missing the boat" opinions are missing the point. As a technology and a use system, Bitcoin compliments itself at every turn. As more coins enter the system and spread around, more people hear about it, more people use it, which increases value, which incites more curiosity, which disseminates the coins further, and on and on and on. 
All things with time. There is no rush. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.

Check out this video explaining Inflation, specifically the first few minutes. Every time (to continue the metaphor) that more chips are added to the game, all of the rest of the chips are worth less (if each one is just a part of the whole of the game's economy).
Conventional currencies in this day and age are worth less each day than they were the day before, and that is because of this created issue of ongoing inflation. With BTC, one unit will always be that unit and this is where it gets a lot of the respect and value from. People on top are not able to steal from people on the bottom through devaluing their savings to cover their debts.

You seem genuine. The reason I'm not worried about abuse in a BTC world is because it is a system with rules that everyone who participates has to follow, and nobody can alter. The only difference between users is the amount of BTC they have, and this doesn't give them more power. 
Yes, if BTC ends up grossly and exponentially increasing in value, people who adopted now will have plenty of "value" to throw around, similar to those who got into it when it was a few cents, or similar to early adopters of anything which catches on. I wouldn't use the word power like you do, though. Coins can only be spent, after all, and then they are gone. A person has traded them for some physical good or service and they are no longer his. There is no policy of interest or controlled inflation or hierarchical rule which influences what happens to Bitcoin, so anyone who has some either holds onto it or sells it for something they and the other party perceive to be of equal value.
That seems to be common sense, but let's look at it closer. If a person simply holds onto it, they aren't really getting anything. You don't benefit from the coins you leave sitting, but the rest of the market does. The scarcity derived from holders is part of what keeps value afloat, and as the desire for BTC to act as a store of value evolves, this phenomenon appreciates (pun intended). Meanwhile, if you decide to spend your coins on something, they aren't yours anymore. They have moved towards the direction of the producers or providers of goods, content, or services. That is the only available direction for things to go. If the spender wants to get more coins, they will need to trade their own goods or services (or a representative of them, such as  any currency today). 
To be more specific about BTC's division, any coin can be split into 100,000,000 units called satoshi's, but this is not a definitive end to it. If a consensus was reached, we could divide further ad infinitum. There will never be more than the maximum of 21 million BTC, but there could be any number of units which comprise it.

What I wonder is how many individuals or groups are going to control 21 BTC or more. A hundred thousand of the million potential clusters? I guess it depends on how much time the enthusiasts get at these lowish prices... I hope to hit that mark myself, completely hard to wrap my head around the implications of a single person controlling a millionth of basically everything. Seemed like there were a half dozen 'I got to 21!' posts this last week alone.

Nobody is going to use a digital system that isn't BTC, that's what my view is. Why choose a system that requires your trust when you can have one that doesn't? I don't think that another cyrptocurrency can be created that is going to be able to match Bitcoin.
I agree with you on b and c, but I think a is where we are butting here. If Bitcoin goes up in value exponentially, then how is 1 cow = 10 mBTC undervaluing the cow? The beauty of this system is that every person on the planet can choose to opt in at any time. It doesn't matter what people in power or what governments say. As people, on an individual level, person by person, decide that it is worth hedging themselves against instability and buying some amount of BTC now, they make it that much more likely that we hit the tipping point. 
There are 21 million BTC and 7.25 billion people on the planet (googled to get that just now). Put that into a calculator and we get 0.00289655172 BTC for each person, if they all had an equal share. At current value, that's less than a dollar of Bitcoin. Who is to say what will happen and what won't? All I know is that I have trouble trusting world governments, and I'm happy to have an option if I choose to hedge my futures somewhat.
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:35:32
All the things you are trying to ignore as important variables are what define supply and demand. There is no existing model in history with which we can reliably predict what will happen with Bitcoin.

They might stop using it because the majority has been consistently abused by those who control it. A system without control can also be a system without abuse. Either way, if capital controls don't scare you, Bitcoin may not be for you.
There is no threat of there not being enough BTC. You're being silly.

This is all semantics, but I would call that a core feature and innovation of Bitcoin, and not necessarily a killer app. When we have the thing which allows people to take advantage of this new ability we have to instantly transfer value across the internet independently and easily, and to WANT to do it... that's when the killer app has arrived.

Shame you are getting downvoted so much, I agree with you. Makes perfect sense to get actual people out of risky situations like back alley meetings or trusting dark entities.

Mt. Gox was human error. The beauty of Bitcoin is that we don't need to rely on humans to have a system that works anymore. We have a pretty long history of screwing things up. Better to take that off the table!
@_date: 2015-07-20 21:06:10
I think you missed my point. People are going to have to individually choose to take the humanity out of it and trust in only themselves and the system.
Even now and likely always, some people choose to keep their coins in a Coinbase wallet (for example) rather than one they control themselves. Becoming the sole benefactor of a portion of estate, responsible for all activity and all blame, is a departure for people and no small one. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:21:27
Not to disagree with you, but it might be because Bitcoin can be viewed just as legitimately as a commodity and as a currency, just like it can also be considered a platform or revolutionary's tool. Maybe they take offense to what they categorize as pigeonholing?
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:08:12
I understand this is a touchy subject. I think that many drugs are really only harming the person using or abusing them, and events where a person on drugs leads to people getting hurt are a consequence of the environment around drugs and not the drugs themselves. I see nicotine and alcohol in this same light, the difference there being that society sees them that way in general.
If people want to use drugs, they are going to get them. It's not as if such things are difficult to do in this day and age. What OP is saying (and what I agree with) is that if whatever can be done to reduce risk for a process is done, then the users (who would have used anyway) are going to generally be at less risk and so will the area they live in. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:26:20
I don't think anybody would recommend using your changetip account as a place to store anything more than a few dollars at a time, it acts as an easy way to spread BTC online through tips and is integrated with several other websites beyond reddit.

I choose the one backed by math because personally, I often do not trust government. 
Your cow farmers can easily choose not to sell! Nobody is forcing them to hang up their hats and hoes and sell the farm, and certainly nobody is forcing them to do it for anything other than what they consider to be a fair price. That's what Bitcoin brings to the table. In it's economy, there are sellers and buyers and no need for anyone else. 
It's all right if we disagree. Like I said before, another nice thing about Bitcoin is that people opt in one by one. No rush. If (like I think) there are advantages to this new system that will become more clear with time, then the interest will develop and people will come. If not, so be it. All life is a stage!

Nothing stops those services from adjusting and being offered. Those services aren't going to just stop existing. It will all be optional, though, and there are no restrictions as to how you seek out a loan or other service. An early example is btcjam.com, or bitbond.com.
The differences are that many more freedoms are available for those seeking any of these services, and through that, more options for the customer. Since BTC is an open network without restriction, service providers are going to need to actively compete with each other in order to win over customers, and I feel that this competition is enough to choke out many malicious actors once we hit that level. With BTC, investing in your customer is the best way of investing in yourself.

@_date: 2015-07-24 17:56:21
Consider this- the more people learn about shortcomings of fiat in countries and economies the planet over, and the more BTC continues to honey badger while the world burns, we may approach a turning point in public perception where growth explodes. 80% of people, the average joes, certainly don't care. Certainly not if they are American. But for people that this new tech does help... Uganda, Italy, Philippines, Tunisia. It helps them a lot.

General application of blockchain tech, with broad strokes. My favorite sections were identity on the blockchain (photo of self holding paper with username/face in the shot) which could then be verified by government (example dmv), and the idea of a city splitting it's infrastructure budget evenly among residents, and then each street corner, park and other community projects would have their own addresses so people could literally tip the street corners themselves to directly impact what areas get work.
Very cool stuff. Thanks for the tip! Happy Tuesday!

Yes, that is what he is saying. Even if a government started a hard fork, people would need incentive to switch over to it that the government/any other centralized entity isn't going to easily be able to provide. So they will stay on the original fork despite all of the efforts of the government, who would have been better off in profit potential just mining Bitcoin for the original chain anyway.

I would say the key difference is that outside of early adoption, there is no way for an actor to use an existing mass of wealth to bully trade in their favor without spending off some of their own pile. There are no negative balances with Bitcoin and no bottomless bucket from which to grab at new chips.

Great writeup, and I think it's a shame it isn't getting more love. Our current system is cumbersome, and few would say ideal. The TLDR says it best. 
I don't think any part of this is a deal breaker- there aren't many holes in what you described. Pre-qualified addresses, and releasing a list of them publicly, seems like a great solution to me. Would X addresses be prepared, where X is the number of 18 year old registered citizens? Either way, having all this information public is the gamechanger. Ballot distribution is a little trickier. Special wireless printers on site that are sent the wallets from washington?

The important thing to do is individually check each profile. I have btc in btcjam, and I only invest if a person has not only a good sized history of repaying their loans on time, but also good reviews.

Completely agree. I think sometimes that people who have lost money on Bitcoin end up being bitter about it, and I wouldn't be surprised (although there is no way of knowing) if many more people have lost than gained. What we need to remember is that this is an emergent technology and a wild west market; there are years of confusion and controversy yet.

A good reminder for people that even though it might seem small when you look at the whole mountain, the snowball that is Bitcoin is still near the top.
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:15:15
They run cheaper and faster with less spending on the part of any business or program. I think any holder is convinced that we are heading towards a future where competition with bitcoin is impossible for any established or usual service.
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:28:22
It'll look like a world-scale Rube Goldberg machine.
@_date: 2015-04-29 14:24:53
Looking forward to reading it! 
@_date: 2015-04-08 04:48:22
All things with time. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 04:09:26
How about that! Great minds.
@_date: 2015-09-30 18:27:56
Sold a copy to me just now. Looking forward to it being available.
@_date: 2015-04-24 20:00:31
Yup, sounds about right. Come on Liberland, lead the way!
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:11:42
Any person who uses bitcoin has a vested interest in making it worth more to others.
@_date: 2015-04-24 15:32:22
I'll take eight!
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:47:21
It lands! Hooray for the universe!
@_date: 2015-03-24 19:41:20
If you haven't read this once in your life already, you should. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:02:22
Hey, would absolutely love to get a sticker! I will pm you a mailing address. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-14 19:09:38
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:11:34
Wow, thank you, this coincidentally also helps me out a lot!
200 bits 
@_date: 2015-03-18 14:55:27
Hey, you are a great comic artist! I love the autobiographical type nature of these =] and very relatable. Hope to see more! Thanks for posting!
500 bit @_date: 2015-03-26 01:44:39
A community thread is useful to have.
I felt like bashco's post to this degree was thorough and agreeable, though. It seems like there is a checks and balance system in place to catch potential abuses of power, and those transgressions don't seem likely to begin with. Guy seems solid.
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:10:36
Still going on? Thank you! I can feel it in my stomach!
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:52:38
This exact thing has been what I am most excited about for years.
It'll take some serious time but just about all roads lead there. The technology has proven itself resistant enough for me to believe. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:42:31
Hey, thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:07:30
Yesterday I made a btcjam account, transferred .2 btc in, and spread it around among 10 would be loans. Sure, I may not see that btc again, but I might also get back .215 btc in 6mo and have helped out people who needed it at the same time.
Glad to see more currencies being adopted, that will spread the love. Crowdsourcing is the future.
@_date: 2015-03-11 14:14:58
Seems like a pretty reasonable estimate. I have a long way to go! Let's keep it under 300 until Friday please haha!
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:13:44
What a line. 88 bits @_date: 2015-03-17 20:03:26
You could likely use it for that, but in my opinion keeping a full bitcoin is quite a bit for a hot wallet. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 03:57:49
Forward them to charity!
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:18:54
It was just an estimate. I didn't give many specifics, so how could he make any specific attempts to solve it? 
Like I said in my original reply, he had a pretty reasonable estimate for what was, admittedly, a pretty loose prompt.
@_date: 2015-10-09 15:41:37
Yeah, I'd say so.
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:39:32
Interesting line of thought.
However, at our current stage, borrowing btc creates buying pressure for btc in an organic way. We don't have a lot of that otherwise.
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:28:53
YOU can tumble.
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:26:56
This is incredible. Didn't think I would be thanking Chinese officials this week.
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:22:01
Especially fridges, better known as the coolest demographic.
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:14:14
Thank you!!
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:53:29
Happy 300! *punt*
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:20:28
Everyone here has an opinion, but nobody knows.
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:32:02
This is a smart move. Someone will integrate Bitcoin, it will attract a lot of attention, and Facebook can begin to more formally integrate it without losing any face.
@_date: 2015-10-08 05:52:12
.003 btc for each human out of the 21 mil, approx.
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:44:27
Wish I could be there! Wrong side of the country =[
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:55:50
Buy some, whatever is reasonable for you, and be patient. Know the risk, of course, but I'm with CryptoBudha. Any day now could be the day.
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:59:23
Integer... 38.
Thanks for posting the snippet about the manual. What a sense of humor!
@_date: 2015-02-28 09:46:58
Great post! 
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:45:10
That's true. There's certainly enough for the trickle of rising we have enjoyed over the past few weeks... and really, if we can keep that constant for another two years, I think most doubters are going to have to answer to reason.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:36:42
This phrasing makes me so happy. I would wear this (or a paraphrase) on a shirt.
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:53:03
Donate to child's play through  :D
@_date: 2015-03-03 04:43:56
AusBit, huh? the new cash of Australians.
Bitcoin is the new cash for humans.
@_date: 2015-02-28 23:37:18
Wait, really?
That seems... very untrees.
@_date: 2015-03-30 09:13:58
I got mine! Thanks again!
@_date: 2015-02-27 17:14:39
So... Sell?
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:24:34
You do this every week =] A hero of these times. Thank you!!
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:28:28
You would have to change every computer connected to the blockchain, not just one. 
It's not possible.
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:27:51
This isn't an investing forum.
@_date: 2015-02-02 06:49:49
I was ready to give up being a shitlord and start stuffing McD's in my mouth if I could do it with Bitcoin.
Sorry, fast food industry. Not today.
@_date: 2015-02-28 23:42:19
This should be at the top. Important contextual information here.
