ZH is full of excellent strategic and technical analysis. However it is a strange mixture of libertarian and fascist, and you can't have it both ways. Many of its subscribers are racist, misogynistic anti-Semites. Or just plain xenophobes. Its policies strongly discourage such sentiments but I don't see this being enforced.

Why r u being sarcastic? BTC is for everyone, so less snobbery please. Thx.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:06:52
Ha! And there i was panic buying. Terribly slow but got it done eventually, and at a decent price too.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:16:47
Then that, my friend, is what you ought to have said first time round.
You can ask him if he has/had 10K on BitFinex, that would clear up the speculation.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:46:15
Not huge on Coinbase either...
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:44:02
Halsey Minor speculated that Bitcoin might not be around in five years time and got a ton of grief for it. My guess is that it will thrive despite disasters like the one today (and more to follow I'm sure). That's because of the much bigger disasters coming our way in conventional banking.
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:51:28
Go see :)
@_date: 2017-02-03 04:27:17
I'm a brit in NYC. Don't know coinfloor as I use Uphold. Can switch between BTC and a long list of currencies and allocated commodities no prob. Can also email sums to third parties. Member to member transactions are free.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:22:13
As somewhere to keep BTC safely, exchange to other forms of value, and use to spend, try Uphold. 100 reserve too.
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:28:50
Btw I also had both Coinbase and uphold. Now that I have ach with my bank i don't need Coinbase to buy / sell BTC. Do it all on uphold.
@_date: 2017-02-03 04:37:49

Feel free to look around ��
@_date: 2017-02-01 21:42:12
Good interview. Thanks for posting it.
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:27:08
Okay. That's interesting re AUD. Maybe write and tell them. Hope it works out for u.
U could watch YouTube on Halsey Minor who started Uphold as BitReserve. There's a great talk he gives in dubai with a brilliant young fellow who advises the government there.
@_date: 2017-02-01 21:33:26
As many as possible.
Purchases used to be in BTC but as price has gone up now loading up in smaller amounts.
Support the idea of using mBTC as a unit of account as it will make it psychologically less daunting for ppl to get involved.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:23:05
I've left Coinbase. Much happier with Uphold.
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:10:04
Take a few mins to watch Balaji describe the vision of 21 on YouTube. Not for no reason it has raised so much VC $.
@_date: 2017-02-12 07:52:13
Unequivocally good
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:42:39
It's obviously legal and has attracted supportive reviews in parts of the financial media. If there's a silver lining, it's that I can't see this sort of thing lasting. Grrr...
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:03:48
Try uphold.com
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:17:45
Thanks. That would appear to be the case :)
@_date: 2017-01-08 08:13:01
Uphold for me.
@_date: 2017-01-08 08:23:10
It's quite simple. Because of inflation, you would need to spend US$1,360 today on stuff that would have cost you US$1,000 in 2000. The value of you money has declined quietly but massively over that time. And with interest rates so low, you won't have been able to grow your savings the way your parents might have done in previous decades. Even without currency devaluations that other countries face, the value of your money is being eroded by governments and central banks.
@_date: 2017-01-18 06:04:49
Or bumped off by a deranged liberal hack like Keith Olbermann
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:41:25
I enjoyed both paragraphs of your message for different reasons :)
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:53:14
If it's true, then this is the same approach that China took three years ago. It's a ban on banks accepting bitcoin, which is very different from a ban on bitcoin. Careful what you post...
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:17:19
Thanks for the intel. Very interesting and all part of the learning curve :)
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:02:42
A lot of irrational exuberance on show today....
@_date: 2017-01-26 09:46:00
I agree with everything you say. Except the words.
Money wasn't confiscated by the state. It was created by the state, ancient and modern (covering imperial, monarchic and post-enlightenment). Preceding money were complex systems of debt and credit and not, as is commonly thought, barter.
Etc etc :)
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:18:46
I'm not an ideologue so don't presume that either the state of market is a panacea. I am simply suggesting that history shows that markets cannot function as a competitive space without involvement of the public sector. You can counter polemically but at some point you'll have to recognize that there is no such thing as an absolute state without absolute tyranny, and an absolute free market quickly devolves into tyranny by strong hands with inherited or acquired advantage.
On your last point: The 1648 Peace of Westphalia gave rise to the modern nation state precisely because beforehand Europe was riven by armies for hire. Of course part of this was to ensure that only the state had a monopoly over organized violence so I am not suggesting that it was to the good. Democratic institutions as we know them came later and continue to evolve.
Free markets cannot exist in the first place without public investment and / or oversight. Economic libertarians confuse individual liberty and anarchist principles with economic activity. Anarchism as a political philosophy rests on self organization and argues that units of organization can play a role so long as they continue to be legitimate in the eyes of the user. Both market and state formations are vulnerable to concentrations of influence and power, which is why neither can be viewed dogmatically as either-or goods. Each needs the influence of the other to work.
Bitcoin holds the potential to construct an entirely new monetary and banking system. I'm all for that. The current one is made up of a cartel of private interests that supports a rigged and exploitative system. But to suggest that bitcoin can or will deliver on a libertarian fantasy is adolescent. In any outcome, there will be a conversation between public good/bad, and private good/bad.
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:40:54
Yep I was a mug :(
@_date: 2017-01-08 08:26:02
I'm buying and holding for reasons mentioned: it's a work of genius, it is made for the Internet, it can lead to financial inclusion and it can help us all bypass the wretched banking system that keeps blowing up the world, coopting the political process and getting away with it.
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:19:40
Can you provide specific evidence to support this conclusion?
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:59:34
A lot of the price manipulation of gold comes via ETFs. So for peeps looking forward to BTC ETFs, be careful what you wish for.
@_date: 2017-01-24 05:00:42
Thx, much appreciate the advice.
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:29:21
Yeah get it thx. Soooooooo much FUD in BTC.....
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:55:52
when was BTC ever great?
@_date: 2017-01-20 05:32:56
So not an attack from "authorized" hackers?
@_date: 2017-01-24 03:16:43
This is all super sensible - thank you. Will keep this one and carry out.
What about keeping BTC holdings on services like Uphold? On this end using 2FA and strong pass phrases. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:54:50
Same as China did three years back 
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:00:10
Who's half as nuts as Olbermann
@_date: 2017-01-21 00:07:44
Well that's true. Was referring to past work
@_date: 2017-01-18 05:24:41
It took 30 years for the internet to go from college campuses to become Mosaic/Mozilla/Netscape. It'll be several years more before we see BTC get close to take off.
Just sit on what you've got and maybe add a bit here and there when you can. It's boring but keeping a tidy sum on one side won't do you or anyone any harm in the long run, and maybe a whole lot of good.
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:22:43
You didn't answer the question. What evidence can you produce to pinpoint the emergence of a market - or free market - along the lines you describe.
It is quite normal for free market fantasists to project their assumptions back in time and construct a narrative of how they think things might have been. But without evidence what you have described here is not even hypothetical - it's an unfounded assumption.
Of course you are entitled to you beliefs and I respect that. It is simply that your inability to produce actual evidence of the genesis of the free market suggests that you are engaging in wishful thinking.
@_date: 2017-01-08 08:04:16
Yep, Uphold for me
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:57:50
Gold has been around 1,000 times as long so has much more social capital. At the moment it's far fetched to imagine BTC having a market cap that large.
@_date: 2017-01-08 08:11:05
I agree, never store on an exchange. I would recommend Uphold.com tho. Allows u to convert to currencies and other assets.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:43:57
Hey, thanks for taking the time. An education :)
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:53:23
Thanks. Will look. Maybe will lie low; as a dabbler don't want to over-extend. Will study from the margins a while. Best,
@_date: 2017-01-21 16:57:06
As of 15 Jan, 98% of trading volume is currently denominated in yuan. PBOC has moved to dampen the worst speculative edge of this. Even then, this is an Asian show now...
@_date: 2017-01-27 00:46:28
So when and where was the first free market then?
@_date: 2017-01-18 05:20:16
Not selling any time soon. More it appreciates more am likely to hold.
Have a modest holding and am instead building up cash position so can escape when the whole shit house goes up in flames.
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:51:53
Gained 10% above principal? Or is this down to rise in price of BTC?
@_date: 2017-01-21 18:57:56
Understood. Mean absolute volume, not just via trading
@_date: 2017-01-20 16:04:12
And yet he's delivered big time. Is entitled to his profit. And has been instrumental in the loss of power of an NZ PM who was found to be lying about spying.
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:35:00
Similar experience. Withdrew several thousand dollars on a Thursday. Nothing on Friday. Wrote and was informed that owing to a technical oversight transfer had not been initiated. Then informed sum would arrive in checking by Thursday, one week after order. Eventually arrived Wednesday.
Previous withdrawals took as little as one day.
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:54:30
No. This is a reported ban on banks using crypto, not a ban of BTC per se
@_date: 2017-01-21 14:33:10
Staggered purchase makes sense. Don't hold your BTC on an exchange though.
Consider using a service like Uphold.com. You can safely keep your holding there, and switch between BTC, £, allocated gold etc. Member-to-Member transfers free.
@_date: 2017-01-18 05:15:20
Weeeell... Trump is going to make Mexico pay for The Wall.
It can add tariffs to exports from Mexico to the US. This would make it more expensive for companies operating in peso to settle in USD. Downward pressure on peso valuation. Some enterprising companies could switch to BTC at both ends of their trade.
It can also make remittance to Mexico more expensive than it already is. That could increase interest in BTC, maybe.
@_date: 2017-01-18 05:08:18
Trump Justice Dept will be merciless on this one, unfortunately. And will lose more badly because of it.
