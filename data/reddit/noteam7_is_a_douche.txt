Forget to switch from an alt or some shit?
The fuck is a guy claiming to make 7 figures doing asking for donations.
Edit: lmao looks like u/NoTeam7 forgot to switch from his alt before [thanking people for donations] (

So u/RemarkableNotice, u/Humblesite, and u/NoTeam7 are all you and are all posting memes asking for donations?
For a self proclaimed rich guy, you beg a lot.
Edit: it's u/RemarkableNotice5! Almost threw me off there
