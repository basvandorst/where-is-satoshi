I am for the symbol Ƀ.
I am curious if someone re-apply somewhere for double vertical stroke B.

I prefer Ƀ because it’s not a logo but a symbol and because I can write it here.
@_date: 2014-04-23 08:06:45
 ƀ or μɃ
@_date: 2014-07-28 09:22:44
Bitcoin needs a symbol not a logo.

Good news. Seriously. We are supporter of Ƀ but first supporter of any real solution. Who are “We”? Do you have a public documentation or any publication concerning this initiative?

Well, technically you can’t, as images are based on the Unicode character U+0243. But the license allows you to do that, just fork it!

Thanks for that!

Smart move from Blockchain. Good news for Ƀ and for Bitcoin.

The following critic is still valid:

No time for this.

Bitcoiners, stop hating Ƀ, embrace change as you embraced Bitcoin. This symbol has been around since the begining and it is a valid solution. Think about design, not personal taste.

Ecogex here. We did not trademark anything. Ƀ was not designed by us. It is a Unicode symbol! All the content of our manifesto  is under an open source license. We own nothing and we don’t want to, it is an non-profit project.

Your experiment shows clearly that Ƀ looks nicer in small size.

We found this [thread]( that introduces one of the most famous logo on the bitcoin forum.
