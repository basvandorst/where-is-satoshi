Capital gains, maybe, but not in inflation currency system.
Imagine lonely island with 2 houses and 100 dollars in circulation.
I want to sell my house but in the meantime central bank printed 200 dollars more. Now my house is worth 150 dollars instead of 50. If I want to sell it, I owe goverment money, because they printed them for themselves.
I have to either give them some money from sale just because the supply of money rose, or I have to work to keep all the money from sale.... Capital gains is inflation tax.

If i pay 0.0126569647989 BTC everybody can track me down. If I pay 0.013, you will have very bad time tracking me. Its just 3% extra...
This is the reason Iam not sending dust from exchanges. Only 1 BTC or 0.1 (0.2, 0.3 ...) or increments of 0.01 (0.2, 0.3 ...) Never send 1.23, better to send it like 3 outputs of 1, 0.2 and 0.03. Then you have privacy.

Iam 3rd world country (1st world is USA, 2nd world is Russia BTW) and I hodl more than you. People in my country (where wage is 1/4 of USA) have saved on average 10k$ in cash or in bank deposits for emergency and they never get into debt, because they dont want to be slaves by not really owning what they "own" by american definition. If you take mortgage to buy house, you have in total negative wealth because you owe more than you can sell your house. In short: "Polished poverty" Americans tend to ignore liabilities at look at today's marketprice of houses and tells themselves that these "unrealized gains" are their net worth. When shit hits the fan, you will not be able to sell your house for gain, it will have 50% of the value before you bought it and you will not sell it because you will see decline in nominal value and you will wait for price recover. its all unrealized gains and liabilities, its not wealth.

They want currency based on or backed by USD to solve printing press problem of USD. It doesnt make any sense. It will inflate anyway with dollar.
Solution is to stop printing money and let US bankrupt because interests will skyrocket to natural level of 7% (which is now decreased by printing much lower) and government will not afford to pay back even principle during one year period.
It will take down everyone who thinks that dollar has any value greater than 0. Anyone whose wage is in USD... Dollar is not rare, they are flooding streets with it.

(assuming lightning network will not catch a lot of attention)
This is the usecase for bitcoin. Its a store of value, retirement plan, whatever. You can pay with it, but its better to pay with some worthless shit on day to day basis. You dont buy loaf of bread with gold, but with some metal-circle-coiny-thing or dirty piece-of-rag/paper. **Its too risky and you are exposing your wealth** Thats why you cannot see your account balance on display at supermarket when paying with credit card. Wealth needs to be hidden at public places. if you are transfering bitcoin anyone can see you have total of 4 of them... You dont want to give out this information to anyone...

Bitcoin can be mined only on one stupidly slow computer, but in this scenaeio 1 bitcoin have to be worth like 1 dollar, because otherwise there will be incentive to mine it with much more equipment. Difficulty of mining will adjust accordingly to number of miners and their computer power.
Total computing power is only function of rewards  of mining and price. If miners now split 12,5btc each 10 minutes, thats 1800 btc per day with price 10 000$. Thats 18M$ per day. So miners worlwide are spending +-18M$ per day on equipment and electricty. If the price or reward goes lower, they will spend less or they will lose money by mining. 
In extreme case in future where reward will be 1btc per day and cost of btc will be 9M$/btc they will have hlaf the computing power as today. If the reward will be 1btc per day and btc will cost 1 dollar, there will be only one guy mining it on raspberry-pi for fun.
In all cases the network will work the same way as today. Block each 10 minutes, but security will be different. More miners, more secure network, less miners, less secure. If it becomea main currency of the world, btc will consume half of world energy produced. If it will fail, it will consume 1 lightbulb worth energy... easy

Bitcoin is ultimate pension system. Longterm hodlers will be rewarded while regular PONZI-oners will starve to death when recession/crisis starts.
In my eyes its better than company contributed system... You will realize it when there will be similar signs like negative mortgages on overpriced houses. Its not worth to take mortgage with -1% interest when prices are 30% above normal. If they fall by this, you will lose money. Same with pensions

If you do it as your parents did, you are paying their retirement and you have to have kid to do the same for you. 
If you switch to bitcoin, their savings in stocks will be worthless and you fuck with them in seconds because there will not be enough buyers.
This is same for metals, bonds, stocks, crypto... You are just buying something that you think will hold value longterm and even rise. You have higher probability to convince people to preserve wealth in bitcoin than in stocks, because participation in stock gambling is saturated to maximum, while bitcoin isnt.

There are million ways how to "cash out" and only stupid people would sell it on exchange...  Directly change it for goods. If Your investment went from 5 000 to 10 000$, then you owe IRS 10-30% (dunno right value for USA) of that gain which is 500 to 1500 USD. So you better find someone, who is willing to accept bitcoin even if you sell it under the market price... If you can choose between losing 1000$ thanks to taxes and current bitcoin price is 10 000, you are better off buying car or something else on craiglist with it and offerring 1 BTC for price of 9500$ and you are still better off.

Look for "money supply M2". Real inflation rate is 7-10% per year. This is the real metric. CPI (official inflation) is calculated from the price of bananas, not stocks, land, housing or bitcoin...
If you look at money supply inflation it explains price of gold, housing, stocks and many others over longer period of the time.
If you are working in food industry you will notice that equipment and other inputs are getting expensive much faster than inflation. Your work and productivity increase is hiding this 7% inflation to only 2% inflation.
