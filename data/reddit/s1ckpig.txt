this doesn't tell anything about the time of your initial involvement. As smart as you are you could have studied and digested the bitcoin white paper in just a few days. Especially because you already have deep knowledge on related subject as you stated in this thread:
*[..] years before Bitcoin I wrote about how strong form decentralized consensus is physically impossible [..]*


yeah, sure :)

this is not even true. 
was aware of it even before sending the report to btc core dev.

**it is not, sorry.**
quoting "bitcoin core capacity increase" FAQ: 


so you would get 2MB only if all txs are 2-of-2 multisig. 
to that add adoption rate. 
you get such gain only if all the network are able to produce segwit-ready txs. 
if the adoption rate is 50% after 12 month you won't get 2MB but something like 1.75 * 0.5 + 1 * 0.5 = 1.35MB

the fork didn't happen because pools built on top of a block containing invalid txs.
it simply happened that after bip66 become mandatory (950 out of last 1000 blocks had version 4), a small pool produce a ver 3 block, because the didn't update their bitcoind probably, and without checking for block version a bigger pool build on top of it.
That's it.
Gavin's PR fix precisely this problem. Before mining on top of a block at least check its header first.

@_date: 2016-03-17 07:11:21
it wouldn't.
@_date: 2016-03-18 12:34:58
you should read mine first. 
what I said is that the fork happened on july the 4th, 2015 did not involve any invalid transactions. 
of course head first mining does not guarantee that the block you start mining upon is valid, it's a mechanism to at least validate block header before start mining (this would have avoided 15/07/04 chain fork).
hence doing head first mining it's a risky practice, the miners who decide rationally to take that risk now have a tool do it properly.

I would be surprised if true, it doesn't make any sense at all. care to point to any proofs?
@_date: 2016-03-17 09:00:48
we were talking about 4th July 2015/ "BIP 66 related" fork, right? 
so a few facts: 
- there were no invalid transactions involved in the aforementioned blockchain fork. 
- a big pool mine on top of a block without even verifying if it has a valid version.
- BIP 9 was created on October 2015 and it still is marked as 'draft', so I don't see how it fit in the discussion at hand a part from the fact it changes semantics of the 'version' field in blocks headers. once it will be activated. That said a miner must continue to check if a block has a valid version independently from version field semantic. 
- Gavin's PR just fix this particular flow, i.e. given you (miner) are willing to take the risk to mine on top of a block without validating all its txs at least verify its header first. 
- Gavin's PR, if applied, fix this particular problem today. Does BIP9 requires a soft-fork to be deployed? 
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:27:07
Sure. 
Thanks for providing the proof. 
Still I feel relieved for a moment I thought the Bitmain was forcing people to point HW produced by Bitmain only toward Antpool.

Xtreme thin block BUIP was published on the 10th of Jan 2016, code initially merged into BU 12.0 branch on the 14th of Feb.
On the other hand BIP 151 has been made public on btc dev ml on May the 3rd, Matt Corallo created compact block  PR (8020) on the May the 18th. 
That said I'm aware you've proposed a [few schemas]( to improve block propagation in the past. 
And I'm aware that sipa already tried to use [bloom filters to improve]( block propagations without success. 
Both aforementioned points do not imply that Xthin protocol and implementation are not valid or has poor performance. On the contrary as you could have seen from the second article of the series Xthin propagation is quite efficient compared to the status quo.

@_date: 2016-11-18 14:18:23
if you say so it must be true. 
Even if that's the case, people involved in BU, and specifically Andrew Stone, have almost 20 years of experience as a software engineer. Andrew is not a rookie and this apply also to the rest of the team.
But as you might know by now even having a lot of experience and having achieved great results on the field seems to be enough, see what happened to Gavin and the to a minor extent to Jeff Garzik.

Come on. Since when the number of commits has anything to do with code quality. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 09:27:27


what do you mean? maybe you want to say out-of-date. 
To expand a bit: this is your opinion and I respect it, but BU not strictly following Core line of development, again, has nothing to do with code quality. More to the point the amount of people working on the project is loosely correlated with code quality and in any case it's not the quantity of developers that determine the quality of code.

From HK scaling Tadge Dryja's presentation:
 
Supposing that: 
- malleability fix is deployed,
 
- block size limti of 1 MB, 
- 1/2 of txs in the block being used to open/close LN channels, 
- all block filled 1% of the time, 
- 6 channels per user per year (6 opens, 3 close 3.5K in total) 
then LN will be able to cope with ~8M users. 
This suppose that malleability fix is in place and that means SegWit will activate sooner or later. Once is active and full capacity reached we could reach ~14-15 million users.

in fact the tech name here is: Extreme Thin Blocks, Xthin for brevity.
if you want you could have a look at a pretty good description here:
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:23:24
the link above does not contain any explanation it just states that it is not opt-in. 
if non upgraded nodes will accept new blocks when ext blk will activate (cause the extension is hidden from them) I can't see why it is not opt in. If you want to deal with bigger blocks you won't upgrade otherwise you will, no?

as you said in your update the remote code exec is not there.
from Sergio tweet 
    **unexploitable** out-of-buffer read access in if(strstr(rec,"false")) as rec may not be zero-ended if 1024 bytes are received.
Do you have any pointer to the actual, alleged remote exploit a part from the tweet of Wang Chun?
@_date: 2016-02-19 17:14:56


This is the schema that explain the exchange between 2 thin-block enabled nodes:
AFAIU the only case when an extra round trip is required is in case of missing txs due to bloom filter false positive.
In the context of above figure, an extra roun trip could happen when Node A does not send to B all the needed TXs because the bloom filter "said" that Node B has txs that actually hasn't.
According to wikipedia false positive probality is less than 1% if for each member of the set at least 10 bit is used to store the element into the BF

AFAIK there's no code merged into bitcoin/master that will take care of O(n^(2)) hashing sign issue. 
There's Nicolas Dodier's work,  but this is still not merged.


It's extremely worthy, imho. 
that said what are the criteria that have to be met for something to be mentioned in this thread? 
by the way next time I'll ask you for permission before mentioning something on my reddit comments. /s
@_date: 2016-07-13 21:08:33


last time I've checked current code still does not fix O(n ^ 2) signature hashing problem.
And I've just discovered, courtesy if Peter Todd, that current implementation makes mempool vulnerable to DoS from malleated transactions.
