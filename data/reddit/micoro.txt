Edited because what I was trying to say did not make sense. I see bitcoin outgrowing the micropayments that are possible now, leaving those to a more capable alt-coin.

Is it such a bad thing if is ground zero for tipping? People tipping inside and outside the subreddit is great for marketing and general awareness imo.

Yeah.. Please look into the story of how Jimmy Wales screwed his cofounder Larry Sanger. I'm not a fan of him for this reason.

I saw the founder of this company present at the North American Bitcoin Conference. He has a huge vision for bitcoin in Cyprus. Hopefully they can execute.

You just got a new download and a fan willing to take part in this.

is not the face of the Bitcoin community. It's a tiny microcosm, and does not reflect thoughts the other 98% of people who believe in this technology.

I think he means that for the first time in history with bitcoin we have a separation of money and state. There is a general feeling among libertarians that with this separation governments will not be able to print the money for the wars/massive spying etc. 
They still regulate everything we buy bitcoin with though.

you should check out one of the coolest designs imo

More respected entrepreneurs jumping into the space = more good publicity.
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:51:46
People like Fred Wilson understand that we need regulation to prevent fraud and illegal activity,  not honest businesses that are enablers of the industry.

Today it's obviously not a problem. When the network grows to VISA + Paypal + cash transaction levels there will be serious issues. 
Right now there's a choke at 7 transactions per second, which we are not even near yet. Releasing that choke opens another can of worms that the devs have to worry about. If it's not figured out we are simply going to move to other currencies like Litecoin.
Is it out of the question that one satoshi = $1 at today's rate in the future?

Here's a rough assessment of someone trying to calculate what the potential value of a bitcoin could be - 
Even they are missing factors because with bitcoin 2.0 innovations one could assume 10% of all corporations and exchanges as well.

It's pronounced like "rogue" with a "d"

I for one have "saved" about $3k because of bitcoin. Quotes because it's a huge gamble. 25 and single so worth the upside to me.

Terrible English. Sorry.

Stick with Bitstamp. It will take about a week once verified but once you do it's very simple to get started there. Coinbase isn't an exchange, it's more like a broker. 
Keep an eye out for the U.S. based exchanges that will be opening this year like Buttercoin.

So say I'm Starbucks, and throughout the day I have thousands of transactions. Every person has paid in Bitcoin. Is possible to put all of these transactions as "offline" so as to not bloat the blockchain?
I am only asking because I see this as an inhibitor to mainstream adoption, and competition to say the Euro and it's 1+ trillion market cap.

I've given out several fake tips on accident. The bitcoin you have in your changetip account is = to the amount of people who have actually accepted your tip and != to the amount of tips you've actually given. I contributed to the mega thread yesterday and didn't realize it was happening until several transactions of mine didn't go thorough.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:40:03
We aren't actually because all changetip transactions are off the blockchain.

You all realize that to get to this world where we have complete control and privacy over our information we need companies like Coinbase to onboard new and non-tech savvy individuals?

Saying reddit "came close" is a stretch.

You all realize the audience Glenn Beck has is literally all of America between the east and west coasts? The fact that he's bringing the idea of potential of bitcoin to that demo is extremely encouraging.

Dude, Bitcoin has never been, nor ever will be anonymous. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:38:38
I agree. You can use the cold storage services of Coinbase (not sure if Circle offers them) if you feel the need to add an extra layer. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 01:19:35
No. Once it leaves your wallet it's not coming back unless they decide to send it back to you.
