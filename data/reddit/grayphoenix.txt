They don't say "Urgent Announcement - Catastrophic Hack. User funds frozen.", they say "We are currently unable to process withdrawals due to technical issues, but service will be returned as soon as possible."
Then you never see your money again.

That's only like $3/hr at this price level.  I don't understand the point unless you're looking for a multi-year contract with someone so that they're locked into paying you the same amount of BTC even if it goes 10 or 20x.  If you don't have some kind of contract like that you'll price yourself out as Bitcoin increases in value, and obviously you'll remain underpaid if Bitcoin stays around these levels or drops.

No that's incorrect

BTC is a great investment/store-of-wealth (perhaps the greatest in human history).  However, it is not a very good currency at this point in time.

The ETF and other custodian services make it easy for people and institutions to buy and store BTC.  If you've ever helped an older relative with their PC, lamented how your co-workers fail time and time again to 'reply all' to emails, or seen a hard drive up and die without warning, then you can understand why most people shouldn't be keeping a chunk of their life saving on their computer.

I'll reword my statement - based on its technical attributes and current adoption, BTC is better suited as a store-of-wealth than a currency.  It is also perhaps the best-performing investment in human history (up over 70,000,000&amp; in 9 years or whatever).
edit: 70,000,000&amp; not 700,000&amp;

Reddcoin has had a bot for Twitch for about a year.

90+% of the bitcoin/crypto community is comprised of men, so I guess reality is sexist.

"You're a sexist for saying a true thing!"

No, us Litecoin hodlers already ate them all.
