Don't forget to also tip them in BTC, they will be so greatful.

I'm actually glad that no user names are associated.
Users themselves do know their own user IDs and thus can identify their own records.

That was a statement regarding his own coins only.

We won't get coins nor fiat back without liquidation. The new owners woud find ways to keep it. They already wrote they'd not give back for one year. Plenty of time to find reasons why to prolongue.

You seem to consider the term "destroyed" as being negative, then concluding that the item destroyed, the btc days, is regarded being positive. 
I do not see any value judgement implied by the language used. If 100 enemy tanks were destroyed, that wouldn't imply enemy tanks being a good thing either.

I tried to figure why you assume people believe btc in rest were good. I rather should have asked you.

I'm trying to imagine their faces when they notice the address the 800 btc were sent to is one of those currently not available for spending...
Seriously, I think there is no legit alternative to returning a lost asset to its owner.

The customer account data is still used to identify customers logging in on the Gox web site. I'd expect this kind of use to go on until the Gox case is finally closed.
In my opinion the user data is not an asset that could be liquidated. It is confidential information shared between business partners, to be discarded as soon as the business relationship has ended.

The trade history is not a fake, it's fucking real!
My deepest appreciation for releasing this information at all and in particular for doing so in a responsible manner, i.e. without clear names or passport scans.
Thank you!
If hackers with the only incentive to get a bit more clarity on how they were screwed can just walk in at Mt.Gox, even after they knew they were hacked before, I worries me what hackers with the incentive of grabbing data worth almost a billion dollars have done before.

If the gox api reports transactions first w.r.t. the bc, we can assume the tx originate from gox. 
If the tx appear on the bc first, the api either reports what happened to gox' own(?) btc on the bc, or delays the reports, making it seem so.
The latter may happen even with btc being stolen, e.g. addresses still known but private keys inaccessible.

I just thought the same. He who can steal the database could change it as well. OTOH, if Gox is suspected of fraud, they may have altered the database by themselves or intended to do so. Thus the stolen database may add to the evidence instead.

They are busy selling their BTC to verify its liquidity.
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:20:56
A mere 35k BTC sold over 3 month drove the entire market down? This is not even 400 per day! If that was true, what would it tell about the market? No liquidity and all the ttade volume and market capitalization was basically hot air. Hopefully noone believes that.

So you don't die of starvation while waiting for the transaction to be confirmed. 
BTW: Is the waitress happy to be tipped with bitcoin too?
