I'm sure it's just a coincidence that this gets to the front page at the same time that coinbase is adding a Bitcoin cash/Euro pairing in their gdax exchange

Coinbase is by far the most reputable fiat-to-crypto gateway that operates in the U.S., hence their ridiculous traffic, head and shoulders above the next most popular fiat-crypto gateway that u.s. citizens can access. It's always good to have access to more than one, just in case traffic on a big swing makes one or another of these gateways too slow or overloaded in a critical moment. One of these should be coinbase, if your goal is ease of use and flexibility and maximum access to liquidity when there's a crunch. 
All that being said, r/Bitcoin has hated them since they added Bitcoin cash/Fiat groupings, and I would suggest that it's no coincidence that multiple anti-coinbase threads get close to the top of r/Bitcoin around the same time that coinbase is adding euro/Bitcoin cash pairings...

Notice the part when he talks about how their customer service has expanded exponentially and is still doing so and can't keep up. 
There have been multiple recent posts on this subreddit about the degree to which coinbase is slowing the network with un-batched, non segwit transactions. 
So, is coinbase sketchy and dishonest and cheating people out of their money?
Or are they overloaded, given the massive influx of new users that are entering the space due to the massive level of hype, and the small number of reputable crypto to fiat gateways.

They will scam you? Really? You are being completely ridiculous. Wire errors and overloaded customer service is not a scam.

I recommend subscribing to r/btc, r/Bitcoin, and r/buttcoin for a healthy mix of perspectives. Never just pick one, anyone who has picked a side is too biased. Relying on one information source, or one side of the story makes you easily manipulatable.

Coinbase owns GDAX, but I believe the use of GDAX to buy or sell BTC for USD incurs no fees, while the main coinbase site does.
