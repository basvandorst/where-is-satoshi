If I was the Winklevoss or Tim Draper, I'd be selling too.

It's really a design contest logo, they have them "designed" for $50. Think MS Word wingdings.

Not if miners permanently switch to another, more profitable altcoin. In that case, Bitcoin is dead.

If I am Tim Draper, I sell coin now, buy back at $20.

This is essentially their exit. They're issuing shares **on their Bitcoins**, in other words, they're cashing out. And if there's no demand for their coins, they'll have to dump them.

So did MtGox until they lost 850K coins.

My guess: the hacker injected his own wallet address in some script that sends funds to the cold wallet, thus receiving the funds himself.

It's time to admit what I've been saying for years: Bitcoin has a design flaw in its mining algorithm, decentralized systems are inherently inefficient to run, and Bitcoin's security cost (miners' reward) has become unsustainable due to lack of adoption, lacking business model and lacking use case.
The only real use case for Bitcoin I ever saw it rebit.ph - but they can do that with Ripple only better. Everything else about Bitcoin is bologna.

Jezus, so naive, Bticoin has been falling for 13 months in a row. When this hits bottom, a more lucrative altcoin will take the lead. It won't surprise me if people switch to PayCoin. Seriously, because that's the state of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:17:15
I think Bitcoin has already done its job, like AOL once did for the internet. Now others will take over.
@_date: 2015-01-01 12:55:22
Sounds like the police used historical internet connection data from an ISP to see what really happened. Smart thinking. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 10:08:03
Nobody. If it goes below $300, it's the death of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-04 07:32:12
Scam. Go away. You're the Bernie Madoff of cryptocoins. Jail for you.
@_date: 2015-01-01 15:10:38
If Karpeles took BTC, those transactions are either on the blockchain, or the coins are still in the cold wallet and never moved. Or possibly, he sold for cash and withdrew fiat, but that leaves a paper trail.

Satoshi Nakamoto's mining algorithm will kill Bitcoin, it's a programmed self-destruction.

Hey, the ECB is 'printing' free money, only $60B per month. Since money is really created as debt, these thieves actually did us a service apparently! Im sure this helps the economy forward, because they'll houses and cars with that money. See, that's why bankers don't think of themselves as thieves, but really as social workers who help the economy.

We don't even know if they were hacked. Their system might have gone haywire and sent funds to an address they didn't control.

Is that the advice he gave before or after his own investment?
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:49:59
No no no. These guys make $20M-$25M profit per year. They're in the top 50 richest people of Slovenia. They can afford a little hack.

I second this post 100%, I have had the same experience. Especially the underpaid/overpaid and refund cases are difficult to manage. Coinbase/BitPay should really handle all these things better.

And the result is 0. Paycoin failed because it's a Ponzi, not because of Coinfire.cf
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:27:07
I think the hacker was able to insert his own wallet address into the Bitstamp MySQL database (or somewhere), and automatically got sent deposits intended for cold storage. That's really the weakest link, the address storage.

What happens to your business model when the block rewards halves? Won't all your hardware be outdated and worthless?
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:59:40
They'll have to switch to an efficient manual withdrawal system. Simply NEVER store funds on a hot wallet. Just never. Never. Never.
@_date: 2015-01-01 12:59:20
it means they're cashing out their coins

The 'idea guy' had an idea. The world submits to your genius and rushes to assemble your deliverable. Just wait. Someone will do it. Sometime. Somewhere.

Hahahahaha. They spent it on hookers already. Come on, we're talking about 4-5 million USD. Of course they don't have that much money set aside. They're bankrupt. It's over.

Not stolen, these are for example Bitcoin ATM's still sending funds to their hardcoded deposit addresses.

It's not stupid, it's deliberate. Karpeles himself leaked this to create chaos.

You're thinking two-dimensional. We need to decentralize the blockchain itself, i.e. multi-chains with interplanetary bridges. You'll simply mine Martian Bitcoin, but you can spend it on the Earth's blockchain.
Decentralize, decentralize, decentralize.

Yes, money=power=threat of violence
But money is also an illusion to make you believe you can be rich by working hard for it (a lie)
Money is also just bullshit
And money still gets women hot and wet, so it's a kind of lubricant in that sense
And money still makes men who lose it depressed and kill themselves or go to war for more
The only solution to money is,
FIND A BETTER REASON TO LIVE FOR

Bitcoins live on the network, the wallet is place to store keys, but an offline private key written down also works--then you don't have a a wallet

Smart move, now he's taking it back. He just kept Karpeles working for him while he needed him.

Ever heard of altcoins? This comparison is wrong, because you can't fork Earths.

This is what it's all about -- those who control the payment systems control the economy. The "cashless society" (operated by Visa/MC) is a fascist society.
