Yep. I will hold until 0 at this point. I panic sold some coins like a noob only to have them spike the very next day. After that the money I'm playing with is dead to me. I couldn't care less if it went to 0 or skyrockets. Thinking this was has made the last correction so much easier to stomach.

Where the hell are you finding frozen pizzas for less than $2 each?

There is no mining if there are no bitcoins. What I asked was what happens when all bitcoins are eventually gone since the introduction of new bitcoins on the blockchain is impossible. Apparently the answer is a hard-fork.

That doesn't answer the question. I need to know where I can buy these $0.66 frozen pizzas!

Ripple doesn't aim to be a currency replacement though. Even if it did, what happens when the supply on the blockchain runs dry? Of course Ripple has a far greater supply in circulation, so you can argue this would take far longer than Bitcoin to happen, but the question still applies.

Very cool idea. Thanks for doing this.
