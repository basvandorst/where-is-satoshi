I posted about this a little bit ago as well. That is my wallet address and I was trying to figure out how the tips are collected?

Well when I set the post on the site I opted to set my public key, which I copied and pasted from my android phone wallet and the site verified that it was valid, its the same public key I've mentioned above.

Honestly I did not tip myself. But when I posted to bitcoin megaphone I almost immediately received tips on the site; within seconds of a refresh, but when I checked my wallet app and blockchain I did not see anything so I am still not sure what happened.

I am using a wallet on my Android phone, I copy and pasted the address from there. When I posted on BitcoinMegaphone it said that I can use my own wallet address which I did and it attached with no issue. I am fairly new to Bitcoin and not entirely sure how everything works. I have learned though you can watch your transaction history on blockchain.info if I am no mistaken. I've watched a bunch of videos and read about Bitcoin and it's truly amazing; I'm just not sure why the bitcoins did not go to my wallet since I was tipped directly through BitcoinMegaphone.

Posted on Bitcoin Megaphone but not sure why I didn't get the bitcoin tip. I was ecstatic to see that I was tipped!!! However no bitcoins come to my wallet address :( ...not sure how exactly this works as I am fairly new to Bitcoin, but love the concept.
My address is: 16xgGGyBTmWNKWWv9TZHtAvo6QA8digqUB

It's named "Bitcoin Wallet" by "Andreas Schildbach", but I'm not sure where the private key is on this app. I really appreciate this help solomania :)

It is marked as "Your Address(es)" which I'm guessing is the receive address, I'm trying to find something online about this too. I'm thinking I should try to backup my wallet as the app prompts me to do that occasionally, what do you think? Will that then give me a private key?

No, not only does it not appear in my app when I open blockchain.info I do not see the bitcoins ever coming in. Only as you mentioned on the other thread Insight shows some sign of the .07377btc; which I don't understand Insight at all.
Here's a screen shot of what I'm seeing on my phone:

No worries, I'm glad I understand why now as well. I actually code myself let me know if I can be of any assistance, I wouldn't mind helping for some btc to get more involved in the btc economy.

Thank you for the clarification, and also for explaining how I can create a new wallet address.
