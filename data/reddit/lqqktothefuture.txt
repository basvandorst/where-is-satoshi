ok at the risk of sounding ignorant may I ask about how this works. Does the seller state the price in USD and there is a way to convert the USD to the equivalent bitcoin exchange amount at that minute? Is there a program that does this? I would like to take bitcoin at my restaurant but the concern is that we take a months earnings say and if we convert to CASH it could be worth less than our USD prices? say its on a dip?

plenty of people have a hard time registering and verfiying accounts at exchanges - i think coinbase requires a US proof of address?

It was meant to be a pun...But I think it was wrong..  'The introvert of money' doesn't work so well.

yes after looking into paper wallets a bit more it is rather cool.

Ok just googled them - so if they scan the QR code into their wallet app it will send the coin to it?
EDIT - I'm going to research paper wallets a bit. BRB

I think the whole point of having something like a Jaxx wallet gives it a bit more realism - they can even watch the value fluctuate - send more money (buy more bitcoin) to themselves. The interactive element is fun. A paper wallet will be kind of meaningless to someone who knows nothing about bitcoin? I'm really looking to spread the word increase userbase etc
