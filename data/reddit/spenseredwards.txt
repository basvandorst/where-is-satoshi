Thanks for the comment you Lead me in a new direction
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:13:42
To give people Bitcoin who don’t have a wallet yet or don’t have mobile wallet. They might not want to move it while transactions fees are high or until the bitcoin price goes up exponentially
@_date: 2019-06-01 02:48:57

@_date: 2019-09-23 21:14:32
I won’t I will be worried when it cost more to send bitcoin to someone in another country then the methods we have today like western union money gram PayPal I will also be worried if no one could send bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-21 19:07:07
Bitcoin will succeed because there will always be money to make from mining and that will keep bitcoin running
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:46:14
Hold your coins keep them in a wallet you trust where you hold the private keys
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:47:16
To buy and sell I wouldn’t d keep them there for the long term
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:16:09

@_date: 2019-09-18 17:21:02
Not really all the miners in the world would have to agree on this change otherwise it would be a hard fork like that cash bullshit
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:20:53
Not trying to be an anti-altcoiner but as a outsider looking in bitcoin is kicking altcoins asses
@_date: 2019-09-22 01:09:54
That’s when transactions fees will increase

My Thanking is that once we hit 20 K one month later will be at 100 K from all the fear of missing out
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:38:09
It caused price increases in the past
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:21:25
I would say sell half of it when that half is enough to pay off your mortgage I wouldn’t sell it all at once Incase you missed the peak by a little bit after the halfing will see the bears again so I say don’t think about it until 2021 at least buy as much as you can afford every paycheck until then
@_date: 2019-05-30 00:01:50

@_date: 2019-05-30 00:51:37
It’s all good fuck the government you don’t need a mMoney services business license to sell bitcoin just like I don’t need a pharmaceutical license to sell weed
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:14:35
Stop spreading propaganda long on bitcoin always no matter what the price is if you are shorting it you obviously don’t believe in it if you don’t believe in it you will lose in the long run buy and hold
