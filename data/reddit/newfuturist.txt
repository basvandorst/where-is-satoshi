@_date: 2015-06-24 13:07:09
What failure are you talking about?
@_date: 2015-06-08 11:54:00
Yes, because people want interest on their money. Because people need credit. Because people want to hedge their currency (no matter what the currency is). All of the traditional banking products will exist with a Bitcoin denominated system because there is demand for them. The price may be different (and therefore things like the holding reserves may be different) but largely any product that existed under a gold denominated system will exist under a bitcoin denominated one.

m2 is debt generated money. There is (almost) no money at the bank to back your deposit. Your deposit is made up of loans, promises to give you back that money. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:56:33
Even people who believe it is a settlement layer (myself) think that the block size is too small. 3 TPS between financial institutions (when financial institutions should proliferate like wildfire in the new economy) is too few.
@_date: 2015-06-08 15:03:33
M2 includes savings deposits. Those deposits are backed partially by real cash, but also by loans the bank owns. You really, really are wrong about this.

There's only one thing that gives bitcoin value. 
@_date: 2015-06-21 22:52:50
Maybe. But the value of bitcoin is in the ability to do transactions. The system which can handle the most transactions will have the most value. That makes doge coin 8x more valuable than bitcoin now from a transaction perspective.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:09:25
I didn't know that. I guess mention that Bitcoin isn't necessarily the best fit in many of the microtransaction examples. I believe that to be the case with the current set up of Bitcoin. We'll see what happens to confirmation times and block sizes in the future.

It's not about it being high risk. I see it as being only as risky as any other technology. But that's just it: any other tech could fall on its face, and so can Bitcoin. I mean, MySpace was the killer app, but then Facebook came along and offered something that suited the masses just a little bit better. Not heaps better, just a little bit. I mean, if someone makes a protocol that is easier to understand, or harder to lose, or gets endorsed by a reasonable number of governments and hence brings regulatory risk to zero, or anything else. 
"the chance of that happening is so close to zero" shows you aren't taking your risk seriously. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:48:55
You got me. I'm an idiot. Oct 13 2010 1 BTC = $0.10. Nov 28 2013, it cracked $1000.

$1 -&gt; $1000 = 100000% increase. 
I'm lost, can you help me out here? 
@_date: 2014-10-23 08:07:35
With a decay value associated with the last confirmed spend at that location, that halves the rating according to the probability of confirmed no-bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-16 08:40:59
In order for per block difficulty to remain equal, the price of bitcoin will have to double instantaneously. It won't, it will stay roughly equal. Of course there will be people who have bought equipment who will keep it on, but for a lot of people, the electricity will not be worth it, and they will turn off their rigs at that moment in time. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 12:26:23
But Bitcoin can easily have m2 built on top of it. In fact, it almost certainly will, because in the case of stability of price, the desire to generate interest from loans will always be there. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 07:53:33
I'm pretty sure the block difficulty will drop at that point. That said, bitcoin took off as the supply of new blocks came close to the time value of money. I don't think that is a coincidence.
@_date: 2014-04-23 11:47:01
The reason why this happens is because people are using electricity that they aren't paying for.
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:22:59
True, except that loans will still be highly popular. the desire to loan out money will be lessened, but that just means the price of loans will go up until supply and demand meet. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:19:11


@_date: 2014-10-12 04:57:10
Exactly. This is the way it should be, too. If Bitcoin is the revolutionary currency everyone wants it to be, we'll be able to give finance to people as we please, quickly, easily and provably. Want to fund a startup in Sudan through loans? Here's 1 Bitcoin in microfinance.

If it hovered at $300-$400, it may indicate low adoption, unless Bitcoin is not adopted by the general public, but instead used to process large volume financial transfers. Unfortunately, though, this is still a little low. Last year Visa did [$7 trillion in transfers]( that's $133 million every 10 minutes. Current bitcoin cap (at $350/btc) is $4.7 billion. I just can't imagine 3% of all BTC changing hands every 10 min confirmation.

It totally is money if you think about it as fractional/zero reserve bank account. The "money" in your bank account isn't there. The bank has loaned it out to someone. But when someone says "how much money do you have?" You don't say "$20 in change and $5000 in loans". You say "I have $5020". This is basically M2 money supply.

Hah! You just gave me a lecture on the exponentially falling prices of hard drives, then told me wifi would be too expensive for most people in 10 years? You can get a wifi router for $40. That'll be 4 cents in ten years.
Anyway, my point is, if it is going to get world wide adoption which leads to thousands of time more people using it for hundreds more transactions per person, we're in trouble.

Yeah, as a former currency trader, I can tell you that when a channel forms, it breaks. Buying at the low might have great consequences, but if you think it HAS to go up form here or it violates some unwritten law of the universe that trading channels MUST maintain integrity, then you are about to get very, very badly burnt. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 02:42:03
When you are finding the line of best fit, you currently give each day the same weighting. However, you really should give more recent times more weighting as they represent more people with a greater amount of people trading. If you did that, you may find that the trend is actually downwards, not up.
@_date: 2014-11-16 07:51:38
That only gives an extra 1.5 years of x10 gains.

Well, like the OP, I'm expecting a 10 fold increase in price every year. I'm investing a dollar now to be a billionaire in 9 years time.
@_date: 2014-10-02 10:09:45
While I agree with the calculations, I disagree that Bitcoin will anything like Visa. I would love to see Bitcoin become the currency with which really tiny transactions are performed, like fractions of a percent. If every time you enter a new wifi zone you pay for a bit more data, and you do that 10 times in a day, you end up with a lot of transactions world wide. Across 7 billion people, that 810 000 transactions per second, or $400 000 worth of hard drives.
Maybe Bitcoin needs to be for big transactions, and something else be used for small. Either way, Bitcoin in its current format won't be the universal payment method. We'll need something else.
@_date: 2014-11-15 15:28:28

You're assuming a lot here...


We'll this is classic expansion of the money supply stuff. Sure the person will expect more back, but if they renew the loan with even more interest, nothing needs to be repaid and the supply of bitcoin is still quite high. All you have is a promise of bitcoin.

Yeah I find this hard to believe. Mining is still not worth the electricity in many places.
@_date: 2014-10-20 06:58:51
I just want to point out how much of a bad analogy this is. No insult to OP, just an observation about probabilities.
Let's say you have pocket aces. You have inside knowledge about the probability of your hand being the best on the table. Taking a big gamble on such a hand is risky: there is a very real possibility that someone else's hand is much stronger than yours, especially after the flop. However, most people would agree that your hand is strong and would bet that they would win, if not as strongly as you. 
As for Bitcoin, you don't have inside knowledge as to the probability of future success of Bitcoin. In fact, no one does. What we have at the moment is market prices: where the risk appetite is satisfied by the Bitcoin supply. At any point in time, the market's opinion is that over the long term, the expected value of Bitocin will be the same + the time value of money (the interest rate). If lots of people think it will go up, the prices will rise accordingly. If lots of people think it will drop, prices will fall. 
Bitcoin is relatively liquid. It is very unlikely you have inside knowledge that the market hasn't already taken into account. 
edit: spelling 
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:02:53

I'm not saying it has it priced right. I am a firm believer of the irrationality of the market as it relates to information asymmetry. Here's my assertion: bitcoin is wildly mispriced, either too high or too low. The long term value is somewhere between $0 and all of the world's M0 money supply. But which one is it? No one knows. And the big difference is, apart from regulator announcements, very few people have non-market disclosed information. We're sitting in a thread where multiple people are saying they've pumped all of their savings into Bitcoin, and you aren't worried at all that there might be some irrational exuberance? I'm not saying that they are wrong, I'm just saying the gold hoarder, and the property hoarder, and the tech stock hoarder all think the same thing.

The value of Bitcoin isn't in any inherent value. It's not like you can exchange it for any physical substance like gold, and you can't peg it to any taxation system. Its value is 100% in the platform; the ability to transfer money in a speedy, provable way. Every transaction for real goods is a boon for Bitcoin that stabilises price and proves its usefulness.

Quantum algorithms will likely be the solution, but my guess is that, at a least in the short-term, that the concentration of quantum computers in state players, and the non-linear scaling of quantum systems will make it hard for consumer grade algorithms to be useful without the caveat of massive backdoors open to governments around the world.

In the case where currency is deflationary, you get laid less and can buy less. In inflationary you get paid more (say 3% more per year) but don't get all of that 3% increase.

Scalability of Lightning is limited, however. Every channel opened needs the capacity on-chain to close the channel in the event that a party tries to cheat. So we can easily scale from 1 on-chain transaction per transaction to 1 on-chain transaction per many transactions, however we still need on-chain transactions for security of lightning.

Bitcoin won't go anywhere while transaction blocks get full before being able to process a substantial fraction of major credit cards. If Bitcoin were to reach 10% of Visa's transactions, it would be processing 15 million transactions per day, or an average of 173 transactions per second.

2. Do an on-chain transaction to set up a LN channel
3. Potentially have enough transactions available to prevent a bad actor from closing channels too quickly. 
So, sticking with just 2 transactions each, that's 14 billion transactions. 
At 3 transactions a second, that's 4,666,666,666 seconds.
77,777,777 minutes

Your discussion about voting with feet/money/mining power is a true representation of the reality of the economics of Bitcoin. However, that desire/ability to walk applies equally to other cryptos. If Bitcoin doesn't change, other cryptocurrencies with greater capacity will take over. The value of Bitcoin is in the ability to transfer stored value in a decentralised way. 3ps is not enough for a reasonable proportion of the world to make their transactions with Bitcoin.
You argue that miners can arbitrarily raise the block size. Unfortunately this position basically falls into the category of the tragedy of the commons. Everyone knows that Bitcoin needs more capacity and 1MB is far from straining the network. Yet when a person to individually processes a larger block, they risk that block being rejected. At the moment, the probability that the block will be rejected is close to 100%, making mining futile. Even at 50% adoption, the cost of mining is 2x higher than the smaller block. You need close to 100% adoption for it to happen. 
So, no one moves until everyone else does. Do you see now why people are arguing for a universal move to 20MB?

Counterparty requires you to buy an external token. Omni (Mastercoin) [requires you to purchase master coin to facilitate on-ramp and off-ramp transactions]( Finally, Open Assets is a [non-private method]( for tokenizing assets.

Trading between consumers **is** secure. Only the first transaction from each address counts for the protocol. So it's impossible to double spend.


On this, you are largely correct. You need to be able to verify that a token hasn't been used before. So the current incarnation of SPV won't be able to establish, with a simple Merkle tree, that an address has received a transaction. This is a definite limitation of XSPOCT


All tokens and coins are originally minted from thin air. Effectively, all tokens and coins (including Bitcoin) have a genesis block event. The trust in one genesis block event over another is fundamentally down to collective agreement. In the case of dealing with a corporation that has agreed to put their tokens on the blockchain, the corporation will refer to you the correct genesis burn event for the XSPOCT they will trade for real-life assets.


To give someone 10^6 tokens, you'd need to go to the genesis burn event, and show a path in which each on-chain proof transaction contains outputs that result in 10^6 being transferred to your burn transaction information hash. Because the protocol only respects the first transaction made by each of the addresses, you can only prove what you rightfully hold. The protocol is absolutely double-spend-proof (as much as Bitcoin is, anyway).

@_date: 2018-07-19 00:24:44
Unfortunately, not at the moment. That said, we're working on a protocol that will allow it to get back on to the Bitcoin chain as full Bitcoin. 
Theoretically it could be done right now with an update to Bitcoin core. However, the simple solution (publish the XSPOCT note on the blockchain as proof of current ownership) would take up a lot of space and would cause everyone's transactions to become public.
We have a more complicated solution in the works, that will allow for an additional secret that gets passed along the XSPOCT chain that preserves privacy while allowing proof of ownership.
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:09:26
If the token represents some external asset (e.g. land, fiat, development hours etc), then you trust that the party backing the external asset will give it to you. It's the same for any token on Ethereum, for example.
As for token not backed by an external asset, all tokens are transferred with an XSPOCT note, a record, going all the way back to the original burn transaction. So you can be confident that you are the true owner of the XSPOCT token, because you can validate every transaction up until that point.
@_date: 2018-07-19 07:17:49

I guess the question is, who can make the ultimate decision, the miners or the people who own the coin? Let's say 90% of coin ownership wants A and 90% of the miners want B. The miners can force B, but if all the owners want A, they can just refuse to use the miners' version of Bitcoin. In the same way that the alt coins don't believe that the strongest mining pool (i.e. Bitcoin) is the standard they will follow, so too could an alt coin closer to bitcoin form a sustainable alternative, not based on mining power, but on the decision of the people who want that coin and its feature set.

There so many packages being published on Github. Many of them, the creator doesn't even think it is worth promoting. We're spending a tiny amount (~$50) to bring attention to this project. Now that people have heard about it, they can decide if they want private token transactions on Bitcoin or not, and then they can review our project and support it if they want.
Your criticism of the company and our protocol simply because we used ads is unjustified.

The important thing is that the block chain will allow you to see how much each bank has in reserve.
@_date: 2018-07-19 00:20:17
You can do that too, our point is that if you want privacy, you don't need to go to Monero. This is why we say it is a kind of a revolution. 
In terms of advantages, you have the strength of the Bitcoin proof-of-work. A 51% attack on Bitcoin costs (currently) $680,000 per hour. Monero costs $15,000 per hour. So, for large sums, you can send money 45 times as quickly.
In terms of transaction capacity, Monero theoretically has the upper hand, but when you look at the transaction fees at the moment, they are roughly the same (Monero is ~90 cents, Bitcoin is 70 cents). Note that in XSPOCT you need to send two on-chain transactions in order to send a single XSPOCT transaction (to the Proof Input Address and then from the Proof Input Address to the Proof Burn Address).

The whole argument against increasing block size is that transactions will occur off-chain.

No. The reason is because a small number of people hold a lot of bitcoin and can move bitcoin price substantially.

So we ([XCredits]( developed XSPOCT, which turns Bitcoin into a privacy coin. It's  a way to send Bitcoin privately using the power of the Bitcoin network for confirmations, with no need to change the underlying algorithm of Bitcoin: [
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:13:07
The currency is inflating, though.
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:37:33
You are absolutely correct. However, I argue that XSPOCT Notes maintain at least a substantial proportion of the value of the original underlying Bitcoin. Remember that in order to create the XSPOCT Note, you must spend the same resources to create the Bitcoin. XSPOCT Notes have a limited supply, equal to that of Bitcoin, and they are verified in exactly the same way. 
To play the devils advocate here, I will put two economic concerns I have of XSPOCT myself:
1) **Bitcoin can always be converted into XSPOCT Notes. That means that Bitcoin has more flexibility. With this reasoning, XSPOCTs should be worth less than Bitcoin.** I have pondered this for while. However, I believe that privacy has value, value people are willing to pay for privacy in one way or another, making XSPOCT in some ways more valuable than Bitcoin. Also, people will only create as much XSPOCT as is necessary to fulfill their privacy desires. Theoretically, the price should balance such that there will be close to no difference in value (although this relies on economic rationality of the individuals/efficient market hypothesis, which doesn't always hold). 
2) **You need Bitcoin to facilitate XSPOCT transactions, which is a core demand side for the value of Bitcoin.** I do think that it is possible that the public might think that the fact that real Bitcoin is necessary to do a transaction means that the value of XSPOCT must be substantially below that of Bitcoin, because there is demand for Bitcoin in fees (in the same way that fiat appears to have value because the government demands it back in tax). However, I think that Bitcoin is already in a position where the majority of the value in Bitcoin is not in its ability to facilitate transactions with fees, but is simply valuable because it is hard to mine. 
We also should consider that if XSPOCT takes off, there will be markets where XSPOCTs will be traded for real Bitcoin, making paying for the transaction fees relatively pain-free.
**On bringing back Bitcoin**
We are working on a methodology which should maintain anonymity, while allowing the XSPOCT to provably get back on to the chain. I believe it is possible, however, it needs more work. In order for it to be able to be brought back to the Bitcoin chain as real Bitcoin, Bitcoin core would need a slight protocol change. I don't know whether the core devs would be interested in something like this, it would be cool to hear their feedback.

We did advertising to get exposure. We also reached out to the crypto press. Many of them are asking for thousands, sometimes tens of thousands for coverage. We aren't being misleading in our adverts, nor are we paying off anyone for positive opinions. 
Just because you advertise doesn't mean you are misleading or or ripping people off. 
We're giving away free software! We aren't making profits from people using XSPCOT. In fact the protocol is so private we can't even tell if people are using it or not!

Bitcoin isn't money. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. It's an asset that some people think has value, so you can trade with it. You can trade it for money, which is kind of an IOU. But some people also think it has value, so you can also trade with it too.

You clearly know nothing about the breadth and scope of education. Probably should have paid attention more in school.

It depends on what you mean by "anti-establishment". Bitcoin allows you to do your own financial transactions, which is hugely anti-establishment. Your ability to do this will continue. What will change is that some old money companies will try to get in. This really should not be a surprise to anyone.

So what about education. You could probably balance the budgets of most governments by removing education altogether. Would it be morally wrong to borrow (at government bond rates, which is SWFA) to educate the future generations?
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:02:46
I understand this line of reasoning, but the value of Bitcoin isn't in Bitcoin bonds. The value is in being able to make easy, provable transfers. The lack of scale makes the transfers not easy. Any distributed currency, in order to get mainstream adoption, needs to be able to handle paying for my coffee. 
I would argue it needs to be able to go even smaller than that again. Imagine a distributed currencies where autonomous internet of things pays for things themselves. This could be taking your laptop somewhere else and paying for 1 cent worth of internet use, managed and paid for autonomously. Even further down this rabbit hole, you could revolutionise the internet from a server-client model to a mesh model (for which it was originally intended), giving much greater redundancy, making links and transferring data without the large contracts that big ISPs typically pay for between connections.

So rather than give a trying to actually price a bound on bitcoin, you would rather say that "this is too hard to calculate" and therefore have no price guidance? 
You can't price in hundreds of years of appreciation into today's prices. If you were going to do that, I would say throw all your money at Amazon because it is priced 3 or 4 orders of magnitude below (future) market value.

I agree with the point that the decree is from the people than the government. However, the supply issue is only true of Bitcoin is only true of Bitcoins themselves. The supply of cyrptocurrencies are mathematically infinite, and we can already see a huge expansion of cryptocurrencies.

Once again, that doesn't explain how Bitcoin is better than fiat. Sure, the Bitcoin is worth something because it is agreed to. But a cup of rice that might cost 10 cents will still be able to feed a person for half a day if you keep it right. The rice has an intrinsic value as a food source. The problem of fiat not being backed by anything is exactly the same issue with Bitcoin.
