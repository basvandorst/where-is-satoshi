thanks for you interest! so I asked my dad who keeps those in a terribly messy stack that goes back 40+ years to have a look, he should get back to me soon. we know for a fact its there somewhere, its a matter of finding it, &amp; in which condition! will keep you posted.

great review by TouchCoin , almost no talk about bitcoin tech in itself, neither postive or negative. pretty good episode for regulars of the show, fills a few blanks from early episodes, well-donw flashbacks. the lost coins are pretty representative of people getting bitcoin in 2010...

your impatience might be showing a desire to buy for short-term gain. if you believe in tech, buying even in 10 days is fine

Debit card (not credit) with Interac Online amounts to 1.5% and is instant on QuadrigaCX (Canada). Best way I've found by far. Cashing out is 2.5% fee

Do live in CA. Its possible to open a QCX account from outside Canada, not sure about using Interac fron intl account... 
@_date: 2018-05-19 03:18:09

@_date: 2018-05-18 23:56:00

@_date: 2018-03-11 16:23:07

sounds like a plausible travel story to me
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:39:20
but everything to do with public perception of said plane's safety
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:46:49

Buterin is a well-known coder for decentralized, heavy load systems, thus definitely not a fraud in his main sphere of activity. I still would like to know on what grounds your calling him a fraud.
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:47:00
Could you even begin to point out the fraudulent aspects of his development ? Do you code?
