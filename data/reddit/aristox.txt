Because of a single red candle?
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:25:28
You're right! ��
@_date: 2019-08-16 06:04:44
It's actually probably just normal market correction

I think you're missing it.
You don't do it to impress people. You do it with people you genuinely like and who genuinely like you because the event and experience is intrinsically valuable.
Looking at everything in life as an investment makes you miss the flavour of life, and neglect the human spirit. Parties are awesome because you get to bond with other people, share your lives and your souls together, and build great memories and stronger connections.
If you're only doing nice things for/with people on a quid pro quo basis and keeping one eye on ROI you're like a man who spooges into a cup and impregnates his wife with a turkey baster because it "achieves the same end result anyway" as throwing her on the bed and fucking her properly.

What do people do at a bitcoin meetup?
Sir around and day trade on your phones with one hand while masturbating the guy/girl to your left with the other?

Also: Oh nice! That's really cool. A minute ago i thought it was weird, but I like XBT now :)
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:54:58
Dude bitcoin is maybe as low now as it will ever be again. Why the hell would you be selling now if you're a long term investor lol that's absolutely mental

Where can i learn more about that 4 BTC loss?
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:31:57
It's okay. But yeah if you want to learn to trade id highly recommend Krown's Crypto Cave on YouTube
@_date: 2019-08-17 23:53:08
You buy it before you leave
@_date: 2019-08-16 04:46:11
Yeah id buy bitcoin around 10k. Might be the last time it's ever that low.
I'm expecting a higher low then yesterday's 9500, then coming back up again creating a consolidation pattern that will break bullish in around a week.
@_date: 2019-08-15 05:15:52
Everyone's talking about it
@_date: 2019-10-24 07:21:08
Nah this is still pretty basic stuff about how markets work that you need to know for trading. Any good youtuber is gonna cover this sort of thing.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:55:51
You don't need a whole bitcoin to get started
@_date: 2019-08-15 03:45:57
Noob question: Why is Bitcoin listed as XBT in some places?
@_date: 2019-10-24 02:27:31
There are good youtube channels which explain the basics of trading
@_date: 2019-10-18 13:37:50
Pretty sure they weren't being serious dude
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:22:30
I know i want it so bad

Nothing wrong with Coinbase. Create an account and transfer your currency over to Coinbase Pro to buy there with better fees.
Get a referral from someone though and buy your first £85 of bitcoin on the Coinbase app and you'll both get $10 free from the referral, which more than pays for the fees

Yeah Jacob Rees-Mogg is an absolute tool

It's a separate exchange that used to be called GDAX, but Coinbase bought them. So although it's a separate website and they dont have their own app, you can log in with your Coinbase account and transfer your currency across without any fees. The mobile version of their website is nice and works great
