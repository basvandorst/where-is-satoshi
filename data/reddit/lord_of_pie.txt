I'm still trying to find info on it, I mean if it's not a subscription you'll be earning profit in 4 months which isn't too bad.. But I doubt it works that way tbh

Ah okay, sorry just had never heard of them before and I generally try to poke holes in new bitminer companies as most end up being scams... from what I've read though they seem to be legit-ish.

Maybe they'll use some combination of numbers with a name, expiry date and CCV to send your borrowed bitcoins to someone and perhaps they could store it on some tangible item that fits neatly into your wallet, you know, like a card.

intriguing, how long do you think it would take to pay off the amount you spent and start profiting? I can't find any info on how much they charge for maintenance etc so I can't calculate it

yeah electricity here is $0.30/kw and then if I go over a certain amount I get an increase to like $0.35/kw.
So not practicle at all

I think you might wanna look into that. I think you'll find that $10 only last's 1 month.

I assume it's a monthly thing yes? you pay $10-whatever per month as a subscription.
If you use a calculator to do the math it works out to losing 75% of what you invest at this current difficulty.
100GH/s = $99.95 per month
100GH/s = $27.56 made (0.01349968BTC)
Essentially you're paying them to give you 1/4 of your money back over the course of each month.
