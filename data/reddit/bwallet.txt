Exactly! 
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:04:53
I'll discuss with the engineer, but i don't think it's viable. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 09:55:59
no,not exactly the same, we did some localization and modifications. Besides  plugin and backends are original, because trezor do not opensource that.  
@_date: 2015-01-22 08:19:17
We don't know yet, but will reply once we find out

And we'll make another post then. Thank you Sir. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 06:35:45
We'll try contact AA and Kristov and get a review. MultiSig is not supported in this version, but will do later.  
Basically this hardware wallet is selling to Chinese bitcoiners (trezor, with all due respect, is too expensive for us),  but we want to see if other country's bitcoiners are interested too.  
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:09:24
We do that:) 
@_date: 2015-01-22 09:33:19
yes, you can import your own wallet. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 09:29:40
it's open sourced and you can build firmware yourself. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 04:39:38
Edited.  Thanks for the suggestion. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:54:48
We are supposed to reply to the upper post about the license content.  Sorry to hear that you don't trust us, you still have our respect as a main contributor to this community. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 09:52:55
What's wrong with that? We leave it there only to hornor Trezor.
And we also solve the puzzle that trezor do not open source, like plugin and backend.
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:24:59
Of course. Just tell me how.

Every innovation starts from cloning. Btw: iPhone is produced in China. Most Android phones are produced in China. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 11:40:39

@_date: 2015-01-22 04:38:23
Thank you for the suggestion.
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:06:01
Trezor  can be connected to Android Phone and work with Mycelium. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:05:41
Not yet, but we have the plan.

@_date: 2015-01-29 11:00:47
1.  No, it's not
2.  Yes, that's obvious, since it's totally opensourced. But not as Trezor's FUDing, we check it to make sure that our clients will have the best service on our server.  If customers are worried about it, he can simply use it without our server, using MultiBit HD or make their own server (IT'S OPENSOURCED,  TREZOR DOESN'T)
@_date: 2015-01-22 06:47:37
Thank you Sir! 
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:20:23
Thank you, Sir. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:13:31
Yes! 
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:14:22
It's cheaper, does this make sense? 
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:15:44
It's opensource, isn't it?  More opensource thank Trezor (They didn't opensource server and plugins)  
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:18:36
You can upload your own firmware to make sure it's the right bootloader; then you can upload the official firmware (or your own compiled firmware)  to make sure it's the right firmware.  
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:12:25
It's opensoure, you can compile your self, you can even build your own server and plug-in (which is not possible with Trezor) 
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:10:00
You can group buy at our shop, the more you buy, the less you pay for shipment.
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:11:25
Yes, we build the server ground up, we build the java applet, we localized it, and we are making more feature. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:16:57
For safety concerns (Trezor are build by hackers), no, we can't include SatoshiLabs pubkey into bootloader.
