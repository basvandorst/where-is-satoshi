Both security and privacy are still in there beginning stages when it comes to bitcoin. For security there is ultimate secure using proper cold storage methods and multisig technolgies. These methods aren't easy now but they will be. For privacy here are a few examples. When send coins there is no way to take more then I give and it does require my personal information, unlike credit cards that you give your cards number out. There are tools to protect against block chain tracking also. In person transactions, coinjoin, darkwallet, mixers. These are also going to evolve but there is no reason you can't be both secure and private using bitcoin.

I am not a fan of these services.
Really all you are doing is moving from BTC to another currency when you lock and back when you unlock. Yet another way to not hold coins until the second you spend them.
If services like this and service like bitpays immediate conversion to fiat. The price of BTC is headed down quickly.

@_date: 2014-11-21 21:04:17
Use loose fungibility because you can't create your loop.
so let us say the scCOIN is more valuable for some reason. People peg the max amount of BTC to the scCOIN. People still want scCOIN, but can't peg anymore so they have to buy them directly from the owner. Also the owners of the scarce scCOIN won't convert back and rather sell direct because they would lose value.

My suggestion is to see if you can find a niche market to explore and build. Chain.com has APIs that can make programing any bitcoin project pretty easy.
Learn about offline signing and multisignature. The biggest advancements that will come from bitcoin is to make it easier and more secure.

The fundamental flaw with credit cards is you are vulnerable to anyone you give your card to. With bitcoin you don't suffer that same vulnerability.
Since bitcoin is a network protocol and is susceptible to various network attacks. With the use of offline signing and multisig you can secure yourself from most attacks.
Give it time and you will see how easy it will become.

You can limit the number of coins that can be transferred into a side chain. So lets say I set the max amount of scCOIN to 100.00000000 so only 100BTC can be converted in/pegged. The side chain has some feature that gives it great value, so people have to start buying the scCOIN outright since you can't transfer in more BTC. The only way the BTC will come back to the mainchain is when the scCOIN loses value to lower than BTC. This is one way of pulling value away from the mainchain.

This is true, but if btc to scCOIN conversion can be limited(cap on number of btc that can be converted) then value can best stolen from the mainchain. There is nothing saying they can't set in a limit. It's a slippery slope.

+1 the Trezor is great!
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:56:29
Just finished up the automation of building mytrezor webwallet on Vagrant using Docker. (runs on Linux|OSX|Windows)
The build time takes a while since it pulls everything from source and isn't prebuilt.
I built this because I had a couple times were mytrezor.com was not working for me. Plus I like the idea of decentralizing the webwallet.
Any feedback would be appreciated! Thanks.
EDIT: So there is still a single point of failure as there is no opensource BOP server yet. Can't wait to get my hands on that. I know we would all really love a local myTrezor wallet! Sorry to get everyones hopes up. I think this will at least speed up the release once the BOP is ready.

I had my Sprinkler system blown out 2 weeks ago for the winter. The guy doing the work started talking about litecoin/mining. I ask if I could pay him in bitcoins. He said sure and installed the app on his android phone. Within a minute it seemed the transaction was completed. It was great!.

@_date: 2013-04-02 22:58:59
Think about it this way, you have 100 flips. 50% up %50 down. You dont know the order and I do. I inject myself during the winning flip 10 times. Your odds aren't 50/50 anymore.

@_date: 2013-04-02 22:07:16
I am saying the odds are correct and verifiable. I am also saying that the site can not change the outcome of a bet. The issue is the site produces a list of the outcomes(secrets) before they do the transactions. This allows the site to know when to inject its own bet to win. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:00:26

According to SatoshiDices verification page referring to _secrets_ "They are not released right away, since they could be used to submit selective transactions and win bets unfairly." 
They are not released the public right away, but the site has them before hand. They have to, to be able to release the hashes.
It seems to me since they can predict the winning bets there is an order defined.
I really wish I wasn't so dense, I really am trying to understand.
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:41:25
False, it lowers the odds. If I can remove some winning bets from a pool the probability goes down.

Would be sad of this was just a ruse to get your "verification documents". Then using those docs to open up accounts on other exchanges to get around taxation.

The biggest dilemma I have is when I want to show someone bitcoin. I will set it up on there phone and send them like a dollar. Then I always have issues re-sending from there phone, because the amount is so low and combined with transactions fees. It also takes 45 minutes before they can resend. I wish it was a little more seamless with micro amounts.

Its not that he is winning his own money, he is blocking people from winning. He is lower the probability and increasing his revenue.

I know a few of the devops there. They come to our puppet meetup group. I will see what they say about it and if they have any leverage. I know they were just bought by another company. So that might come into play.

According to there verification page.
Secret keys "could be used to submit selective transactions and win bets unfairly"
Yet they generate the secret key before the day of transactions and only release it to the public the day after trading.
This only prevents the system from changing the outcome of someones bet, but does not protect against them injecting there own bets since they know the order of the wins/losses. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:08:08
Was coming back to say that.

You should write either a bash script or a puppet manifest for this process to save time.
This brings the question. If there was a site where you could pay 5usd in bitcoin to launch a full node on amazon cloud for a month with a push of a button. Would you want it? Also is there other services you would want at a push of a button? The only limitation is that all the vm would be hosted on an account I would own and wouldn't want people to have direct shell access to for security reasons. Let me know.

or faster.
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:12:06
So we are agreeing they can predict the order for which bets will win, and could possibly inject there own bets during a winning sequence before a customer.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:43:33
So youd still have to pay the tax without converting it to USD?
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:56:12
The verification section explains they dont release the secrets till the following day, meaning since they have the secrets the day before, they know the outcomes. This means they still can inject there own bids. This actually proves my point.
The only thing this verifies is that the outcome didn't change.
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:34:10
The no chargebacks would allow the scammers to win. Paypal accounts are compromised all the time. The scammer would then just hit the checkbox for no chargeback.

Gotcha, I was under impression it wasn't calculated per transaction and the secret gave away the order of the wins. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:39:53
The machine only dispenses 3K per person per day? I don't see how they could limit per person.

Can you elaborate on how this protects predicting win by the system? They state they dont release the secret key till later because it could be used to predict bets.
