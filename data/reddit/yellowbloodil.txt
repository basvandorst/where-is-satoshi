I've been told there's a mountain of bitcoin just sitting in California, waiting to be picked up!
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:13:24
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:35:13
Hopefully better wallets will come up.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:36:21
I'm not aware of any. Also, about 12 hours have passed since the last mined bcash block, so even if deposits were allowed you couldn't really deposit anything in a reasonable timeframe.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:09:45
Just refresh it.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:13:54
Well they're not btc miners anymore are they?
Please keep asking questions, I'm having fun.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:35:50
would appreciate a serious answer :)
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:50:15
Exactly. But for safety reasons, you should first move your Bitcoins to a new address. So the old address will have a balance only on the bcash chain.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:52:29
Happened to me as well, but fixed by itself after the night. I managed to send the bcash to a new address which is waiting for confirmation still.
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:03:09
Maybe? Is that a new altcoin? @_date: 2017-08-02 13:49:13
I'm not familiar enough with hardware wallets. The first step is about securing your Bitcoin and avoid the risk of exposing them to a bcash wallet that we don't fully trust.
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:08:21
As a software engineer, increasing the block size sounds to me (and should sound to you as well) an equivalent to "The service we coded is slow so let's add more CPU", or "It got stuck again, restart the server and it'll be fixed".
That doesn't look like a good solution. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:12:48
What do you mean by "an address that I already had"? If you have another old address with bitcoins, you would want to cash out the bcash from that address as well. If it doesn't have bitcoins, and it wasn't generated from a common seed of the wallet you use, then it's ok to use it. Though, it's not like new bitcoin addresses cost money.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:26:11
that doesn't make sense in large scale trading either. If you look at the stock market for example, you'll rarely see a stock that has such a high price for a single unit.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:47:45
You're correct. If you don't want to sell the free BCash, you don't have to do anything. I will make sure to make it clear on Step 1 of the guide.
You can keep hodling and you may follow this guide years from now if you like, as long as both of the chains still exist.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:37:12
It's not worth the risk.
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:50:00
does it scale though
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:15:57
Fuck Bitcoin Cash indeed, see how to sell it here:
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:53:49
It's not a bunch of people, it's a group of big mining pools. I think the BCash limit is 8 MB.

@_date: 2017-08-02 19:31:37
Exactly. Notice the updated guide - I explained how to make sure the Electron Cash works with the BCash network.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:51:55
Good to hear :)
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:05:38
Maybe this guide is a scam to floor the price faster? :D
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:35:05
Sure. Do you want permissions to the repo so you can update it if I'm not fast enough? Contact me.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:35:36
What do you mean they "evaporate"? If you see your addresses on BCH getting empty, your BCH wallet is probably misconfigured and listen to the Bitcoin network instead of the BCash one. Check your addresses on blockdozer.com .
You may also benefit from [my guide](
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:51:16
I'm not sure I follow. You only need to move your Bitcoins to a new address. You can create this address in whatever wallet you're using, but you should avoid using the same seed (in case the see leaks). Remember that this transaction will only be valid in Bitcoin, your BCash stays on the old address.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:27:49
Weird. They didn't require anything from me.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:08:30
Not as confusing as the imperial measurement units.
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:26:14
That's what commas are for. It's fairly easy to read a number like 6,000,000 when you use commas.

Give more details so I can add it [to the guide](
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:57:56
No, it's a fork that allows bigger blocks, against the core developers decision who support segwit.
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:37:25
I did just withdraw my BTC from HitBTC. Will update the guide, thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:25:04
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:52:00
And yet people keep asking about it everywhere. You're right though, maybe the guide should start with a take-a-deep-breath note.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:17:30
That's exactly it.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:55:55
For me it got fixed by itself after a night. Not sure why, but it forgot the Bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:06:06
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:33:42
That would work.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:22:02
HitBTC and ViaBTC should support it, but the mining isn't fast enough to confirm the deposits.
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:26:37
Sell through HitBTC, 2 confirmations deposit and fast BTC withdrawal.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:04:39
You probably missed the first and only step of the guide, which tells you to move your Bitcoins to a new address before doing anything bcash related.
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:08:57
I don't see much demand for it, but it will be fairly easy to duplicate it and make the needed changes.
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:37:05
wait, what's a $10 Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:07:04
No, segwit doesn't require a hard fork. Bigger blocks does. Bcash is a fork, or an altcoin, whatever you wanna call it. Segwit isn't activated yet.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:49:39
Holding is a bet exactly like selling is.

The jump is way too sudden. Something is up.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:21:23
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:20:59
Personally I believe the price will hit rock bottom once it's easy to sell it. This guide is for people who wants to sell, if they prefer to hodl this guide is irrelevant for them.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:10:34
I'm not familiar with hardware wallets, but if someone adds an explanation I'll accept it of course.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:42:39
Yea, I might've heard something. 
I'm saying that a transactions spam will rise fees, and wallets of real users will adjust the fees accordingly, thus the miners will process the real transactions first (with the high fees). When they want to reclaim their spam fees (at the bottom of the mempool), they just stop the spam and mine the mempool.
If they share the profits fairly between themselves, they'll only lose fees that non-cooperative miners will mine. That why it's important for them to unite as much as they can.
They can do this regardless of block size.

That's Bitcoinity's choice, not mine :(
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:48:54
Exactly. It's just a matter of calculating what percentage of hash power in the cartel, and how much spam, will make it profitable. If the cartel owns 85% of the hash power for example, it won't require a lot of spam to make profit. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:43:28
Ah. So odd. In Israel both the employer and the employee have to put money in the pension plan, but it's completely owned by the employee. I hear in the US the employer can actually use the pensions if the company goes bankrupt, that's fucked up. Thanks.

I sold most of my BCash the moment I was able to and it didn't peak much afterwards. You can't really anticipate the price of course, but it's pretty safe to assume that the general direction of both BCash and 2X is down to zero.

That's why the first step is always "secure your Bitcoin by moving it to a new address", and only then move the altcoin bits.

This comment is even more epic:






@_date: 2017-10-21 16:51:53
That's actually a very cool idea.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:36:23
If you move all of your pre-fork Bitcoins to a new address, on the Core chain, and then move your B2X to a new address on the B2X chain (or directly to an exchange for selling), replay attack is irrelevant. 
However, if, after you'd move your Bitcoins to the new address, you see that your B2X were also moved to the new address, then I guess you'll need to wait for a replay protection.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
