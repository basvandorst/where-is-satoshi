If you’re talking about a full Bitcoin, then yes, I would place a limit sell at $12,500. Buy again when it pulls back to around $11,000. 
Congratulations- you now have $4,500 and 1 BTC. Or, reinvest the $4,500 you just saved and you’ll have 1.4 BTC. 
Take advantage of the price swings.

I am one of the Wall Street retail traders that recently got into Bitcoin (my friend showed me Bitcoin in 2010 and I thought it was stupid, but that’s neither here nor there at this point). 
Anyway, I don’t agree that people generally see BTC as a “safety net” long term. More likely, people see BTC as an excellent speculation tool. The newcomers aren’t here thinking they’ll one day retire on 1 BTC. We are here to swing $13k worth of BTC into $14k, then rinse and repeat. BTC is the tool by which to make normal money.

It’s a real issue that we are still measuring the value of BTC vs our local currencies. When measuring against the dollar, Euro, or Yen, it really shows that our goal is to make a lot of fiat off of our investment into BTC. 
If we really wanted to collect large amounts of BTC because we thought satoshis would be the pennies of 2040, then we would cheer when prices dropped so we could load the boat before then. Instead, we do the opposite and cheer for 52-week highs. 
When we stop saying, “BTC hit $8k,” then I’ll know we are serious about replacing currencies.

You have a very zeitgeist view of how banks work. There are a few problems with your scenario:
1) “a banker” doesn’t exist. There is a bank in that community, and it probably employs people in that community. There’s no boogeyman. 
2) “the banker” does not own 50% of the money. Banks get their money from deposits that people put into the bank. That is, if 50% of the community’s money were in bank deposits, then that bank can loan that money out to other people at interest. But it does not rightfully control that money since people can withdraw it whenever they want. 
3) banks do not print money. They manage other people’s deposits and they can use fractional reserve banking to request more from central banks. Printing of money is highly controlled, and no consumer bank can get 100% of their deposits in money from a central bank. 
Your scenario is more made-up than realistic. It is not a “simplified” version of reality; it’s just wrong.

Why would we want houses to drop to the value of x? They wouldn’t be nice houses with swimming pools, garages, and solar panels. They’d be shacks. The average person would only be able to afford the most meager of dwellings. 
I’m not convinced that “the price of nice houses will go down to x because there are no loans to artificially inflate the price of a house.” You can’t even transport the concrete needs to build a foundation for x in most people’s accounts.

Everyone in this sub with their 0.43 btc needs to calm down. This man traded a speculative asset for a diamond ring.

We had housing before the renaissance, yes. But it is not my goal to go back to the feudal age where sharecropping was a leading industry and inheritance was the primary source of wealth. 
Consider this- right now, I can take out a $400,000 fist loan and get a great house. If I were using bitcoin, I’d have to actually have 90ish btc to throw at a seller. Even if some organization were willing to lend me 90 btc to buy a house and they deposited it into my wallet, forgoing all anonymity, how is that arrangement any better than just using fiat? At least with fiat, the dollar-value of my house will rise due to inflation. With btc, the btc value will decrease because it is deflationary. Good luck paying back 90 btc over 30 years.
@_date: 2019-04-07 05:42:18
Ignoring everything else- How can I ensure my heir will receive my btc without me giving my private keys to someone before I die? I won’t trust my estate to a bank deposit box. At least lawyers specializing in estate planning have oversight to make sure they don’t run off with my loot. With a private key in a lawyer’s office, the lawyer could sweep my wallet into his own anonymous wallet and there would be no way to prevent him from doing so or even prove that he was responsible. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:44:31
I need you to help me understand some of your counterpoints. Please elaborate.
a) you say my problem is not with btc, but with sacrificing btc’s anonymity. This makes sense. If I were a whale and decided to lend someone 100 btc to buy a house, and I sent that money to a public address that is know to be owned by you, is there an enforcement mechanism to force you to pay back that loan? Can we make one? Can the whale expect to ever see that btc again? Tell me, because that would amount to a “loan.” We just have to build an enforcement mechanism before this method becomes viable. 
b) I understand that we don’t “need” consumerism to survive. We existed as a society before consumerism. But do you not see how having an incentive to spend instead of hoard money forces the ultra-rich to move money out of their accounts? Imagine if you have 10,000 btc. What will that be worth in 2040? More than it is now, so you should hold it unless you absolutely have to spend. What will 10,000 be worth in 2040? Less than it is now, so you should invest your money or spend it. With deflationary currencies, there just isn’t enough money changing hands to sustain jobs and economic growth. We would all become highly frugal. The only winner in that scenario is the environment since we would just consume less stuff. 
c) I’m struggling with this because I find it highly different than fiat in this regard. With fiat, I can put my money into a trust that my juvenile son will access when he comes of age. I can give my estate planning to a certified lawyer who has oversight to make sure everything is in order. I cannot do this with btc. There is no trust that I can put my btc in for my heir to inherit. There is no estate planner who can ensure my btc actually reaches my heir. Right now, passing on your btc to someone means either doing it before you die (unexpectedly in a car accident?) or leaving your private key somewhere. I’m not leaving my estate to a bank deposit box. If we want to btc to be inheritable, we need to create a system first. 
d) the goal of btc was to create an anonymous currency exchange. Right now, I can buy 20 btc worth of stuff and the government wouldn’t know I did that. There might be certain situations where the government “knows” someone received btc and could levy a tax, such as when a highly-publicized transaction between a whale and a business takes place. But otherwise, transactions will be anonymous. The government will not be tracking who received .002 btc working at a deli. We would have to register our addresses with the government for them to be able to reliable levy tax. And as much as we hate taxes, they are the reason we have a society. 
e) without loans, there are a few ways you can run big projects: slavery, life-and-death necessity, convincing people that they should do it for god, and some other creative ways. We had Tenochtitlan before loans, sure, but they had a healthy stream of slaves and ground corn. Loans have been around longer than you believe. Loans before fractional reserve came from the ultra-wealthy that actually had the “cash” to do it: churches, royalty, etc. They were aided by the fact that you can inherit fiat, thus allowing a multi-generation stream of wealth. Fractional reserve banking lets banks make loans with only a portion of the money on hand. That is, a bank can loan 100 btc without actually giving someone 100 btc. It sounds risky, but the bank can assume risk by doing their best to ensure that loan will be paid back without anyone actually coming to collect the btc they used to loan out. In the case of btc right now, such a loan would have to come from a whale or a miner. But that organization would actually have to have the btc on hand because we have no fractional reserve methodology. Whales would be wiped-out in a day, and there is no enforcement mechanism to make sure anyone repays the loan. Besides, btc is deflationary. Why would a whale want to loan out btc anyway when they can just hodl and gain more wealth than they could by making loans (and less risk)? Right now, we cannot make loans in btc unless we create an apparatus to sow us to do so. And until we can make loans in btc, no one is going to fund a major project with btc. No one is forking over 1,000 btc to build an airport. And we do not want to go back to the Bronze Age “when they built things without loans.”
I know that was a long read. If you’ve got some answers, please help me understand.

Rich people are becoming richer in spite of inflation, not because of it. 2% inflation means jack to an average person because you might be losing 2% of your $10k bank account. Meanwhile, the price of your assets (IRA, house, etc) should theoretical rise by 2% due to inflation. 
People with a ton of assets are the ones gaining wealth because even though their cash value decreases (losing 2%/year of a $36 million is a lot of money and a big deal), they’re buying-up assets that increase with inflation. This is how the ultra-rich get richer. They avoid the bad effects of inflation and take advantage of the good ones. We levy an estate tax to recover some of that money to prevent the rich from just purchasing and owning everything of value. Without inflation at all, and without an estate tax, the rich would just hoard their cash because they’d have little reason to purchase assets with it. We need the rich to put their money into circulation, not hoard it in accounts.

Loans have been around since the Renaissance (and probably before that, for all I know). You simply can’t build a housing community in a cash-only manner. You need to finance debt in order to do so. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:52:15
There are some ways in which I agree with you.
We should repair instead of replace so that we don’t produce as much waste. 
We should culturally change so that we do not value ourselves in terms of our stuff, thus we won’t be so eager to spend on what we don’t need and thus save money and reduce waste. 
We should be motivated to improve society without the incentive of money. 
However, we also have to be realistic. I like my airports and my cruise ships. But unless we are going back to slave labor, there is no way we are going to build an airport without having to finance it. Without a fractional reserve system of finance, the only ones who could actually finance an airport would be an ultra-wealthy person like royalty, the Vatican, or Goldman-Sachs. Unless we are looking to hand even MORE power to large corporations, in the form of letting them be one of the few entities with enough capital to finance large projects, then letting go of fractional reserve banking would be a mistake. Until we create an apparatus of fractional reserve banking involving btc, we cannot sustain economic growth. We would actually regress to a less developed era.

I’m convinced that literally everyone in this sub is here to get rich. That is why we always talk about btc in terms of what it is worth in fiat. The only time we say “1 btc is still worth 1 btc!” is when it crashes versus fiat. 
When we stop measuring btc in terms of fiat, then I’ll say we aren’t here to become millionaires.

There are two. One of them is a small island.
@_date: 2019-04-07 05:26:13
a) you can charge interest on loans in btc, but you’d have to sacrifice anonymity. 
b) we cannot function economically when there is a huge incentive to hold “cash” (btc) and not spend it. “Spending money” is not the same as “going into massive deby,” so don’t confuse the two. 
c) My heir is 5, so he’s not touching my private key. This is the same reason we have trusts for juvenile heirs who are inheriting normal money. 
d) how can you enforce taxes on people who use bitcoin when it is anonymous? People might use a new wallet for every transaction. 
e) I’m struggling to see why this is incorrect. You cannot give someone 500 btc on loan unless you have 500 btc to give. There is no fractional reserve method by which to achieve this. We can’t build an airport without debt. No one will have the means to finance it. 
If you’ve got answers to these problems, please elaborate.
