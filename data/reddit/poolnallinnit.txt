Theres a similar story of Aussie businessman Kerry Packer who was an incredible operator. High stakes poker room, and there's a Texan oil guy making all the noises about how rich he is. Packer asks him to quieten down a bit, he's disrupting everyone. Guy says do you know who I am, how rich I am? Packer pulls out a coin and says I'll toss you for it.

yup, except for things such as a car, house or investing which would need to incl registeration to operate/own/invest. So youre ok with seeing your coins future use as basically discrepancy expenditure?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:17:15
let them eat cake.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:31:57
and so, following your logic through, what good are the coins to you? You cant cash them into you bank account at any point. You cant buy any assets such as a house or car with them as that would mean youve associated your name to the coins and can be traced back from inception.
Genuinely curious how they end being of any value as you wont be able to transact them without expecting a tap on the shoulder at some point

Draper always reminded me of Brian from Family Guy.

Ill give you $1001 for it before Sunday comes.

who said anything about trends? You stated there was a 'current stampede' at hand. 


continue on with your condescending tone, its cute.
@_date: 2016-06-27 02:56:37
Youve an odd understanding of the term "stampede". Even the UK are hardly stampeding out the door now that the reality of the situation is dawning on them.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:32:02
So can we hold off on claiming them or do we need to do it now or risk missing out by claiming them at a later date? 
What I do have is some BTC on my trezor. What I dont have is any idea of what I should currently do!

if youd access to free electricity, would it make sense to mine at this stage of difficulty?

Let me make it easy for you, a tutorial for others so we stop seeing this. 
Give me your fullname, credit card details for.your lowest interest card, DOB, current address and blood type. Then just take your wallet from your pocket, put it beside your computer. Make sure there are no magnets near it. Then grab a beer, ill do the rest.
I'm only doing this the once mind you, can't be at this all day. next time, it'll cost you.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:01:08
Any pointers on where you'd find out about the basics of mining? Turns out a pal has rented a place for years and never had an electricity bill
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:20:59
youre giving a lot of personal financial info that you may want to be a bit more cautious about. circa 40k investments, 15k cash on hand and at least 1k/week discretionary, you may be putting a target on your back.

That still doesn't get his money out of his account unless your suggesting open a union account simply to act as a stepping stone between us bank and Gemini

It's certainly support but not sure you'd call it generous given it's off the back of a cool bil move.

I don't think any conclusive decision is made May 15th. I believe that is just the final day for submissions.

Ask someone their height in the UK and they are not going to answer in cm. Without doubt they will use feet and inches. Ask them their weight and they likely tell you in stone

So if I have an offline wallet like a Trezor and transfer from one trezor wallet to another, it costs?
