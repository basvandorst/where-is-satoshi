He convinced her to spend a whole 5 bucks?

Can you post a video of the prototype in action?

No one here is agreeing with you, you're being downvoted across the page. You aren't changing anyone's mind, and your username is stupid.
But hey, call me a druggie and climb back on your high horse.

There are plenty of reasons to lie about it.

He didn't deal drugs, you dense moron. He ran a marketplace.

Lost almost 100 btc. Initial investment was under 1k, but i had never realized any gains. 
I was insanely depressed,  embarrassed,  and had trouble sleeping and thinking of anything else for a few weeks.  I didn't tell virtually any of my close friends or family because of the embarrassment. 
I still only make abt 400/weekly and have basically 0 savings.  I thought bitcoin would be my chance to create savings and put a down payment on a house,  eventually.  I was very angry with Karpeles but that anger has subsided. Now I'm angry at myself for not knowing more about cold wallets. 
It really,  really,  really sucked. Keep your head up guys,  you never know when another lucrative opportunity will come along. ...BTC was going to be my "gold rush" moment.
Thanks for reading

Already on it,  thanks.  Managing to pay all my bills on time,  feed myself and the dogs, and put away at least 150/mo into savings. 
It's tough when i think about potentially having a 75-100k cushion. Mark Karpeles still gets his Starbucks,  i can't afford coffee.

Good on you. Keep us updated please.

Lol. Explain to me how 140 in cash versus 100 in Bitcoin "devalues" btc. It actually does the opposite by implying the btc are more valuable, genius.
