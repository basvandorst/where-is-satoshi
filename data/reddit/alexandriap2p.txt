Eventually, yes - right now our publishing interface is designed specifically for videos, but we'll be adding more content types over the coming weeks. Music up next :)

Absolutely - you can start getting familiar with our api here:  and if you'll DM me your email i can invite you to our slack to discuss the details of how everything works

We're storing the meta data in the florincoin blockchain so it was simply easiest to verify addresses within that chain initially, but content creators will be able to use any ECDSA address for a publisher address in the future, to include Bitcoin or Litecoin or Ethereum, etc...

cut of profits, no, but content creators will only be able to sell their content if its getting seeded enough, so it will be their responsibility to ensure that it is. if its popular enough, they wont need to offer money as extra incentive, but for some pieces of content they will. this will be as a metered X price per Y period kind of thing, or X price per Y bits shared, not X percent of Y purchase price. and we wont have the audience automatically seed anything unless they opt to do so.
And yes, we know BTC isnt well suited for 1 cent payments right now, we're looking toward the lightning network or some other off chain solutions to address that weakness.

yes, i love this idea as well, i have a few friends who make and manage some really fantastic playlists on spotify, and i'd love to be able to send them a bit of coin each month to encourage them to keep it up - you're essentially describing the activity of content curation as a paid job and thats absolutely a part of our plan :) users will be able to curate and subscribe to blacklists, whitelists and sub-lists (playlists). and subscriptions will be able to be free or paid.

the two most appealing possibilities right now are the lightning network (even the current implementation, thunder, could work for our purposes we think) and using an altcoin which protects its ability to handle micropayments (like LTC) along with a frictionless instant trading mechanism so that users can keep their primary balance in a more stable valued chain like BTC but have some amount of their balance in LTC so its spendable (can send as low as 1/10 of a penny)

Hi John - we understand that you're convinced that a little known alt simply cannot actually scale securely and we recall that you've been pushing for us to switch to blockstack for about a year now. I promise we haven't stuck with flo for some weird dogmatic reasons, we have a great plan for how it will be able to scale and actually protect its contents, and after more than two years of working on this project, we still truly think that doing it this way is actually the right long term choice and that depending on the Bitcoin blockchain for this function would in fact be a mistake.

storage and distribution will come from a combination of voluntary seeding, which is a good enough motivator for popular content that it enables the bittorrent network to own nearly 1/3 of internet traffic these days, and paid seeding when some financial motivation is needed.

Providing permanence, un-maleability, and un-censorableness (if you'll forgive my creative english there) were driving motivations for the app.
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:20:50
un-maleability = intractability?

The media content is "stored" and distributed via the Bittorrent mainline DHT right now. We had our eye on IPFS last year but recently saw some big moves on their part so we started talking to Juan yesterday about using it to replace the mainline DHT in Alexandria. The "locator" for the file in the DHT, it's hash (or magnet link), is stored in the Florincoin blockchain, tho we are looking at also publishing to the BTC blockchain and some other possible solutions as well.

Ok, that was awesome. Bill S Preston Esquire thinks Alexandria "looks amazing"

some people in the bitcoin community seem to turn off instantly as soon as they hear that another blockchain is being used for some functionality. it's somewhat understandable after all the scammy coin launches last year, but thats certainly not what we're doing with Alexandria. We are using Florincoin for a purpose that it is extremely well suited for, storing data - it allows us to store 528 bytes per transaction. We also use Bitcoin for the purpose its extremely well suited for, sending tips and payments. Its our opinion that the bitcoin blockchain should not be used for everything under the sun, but we have a very open mind about how best to implement Alexandria. If the community feels that it makes more sense to add all of this extra data to the Bitcoin blockchain for its security value, then things will probably move in that direction. We're of the belief that blockchains with specialized features should be used for specialized services and that apps should simply take advantage of how frictionlessly they can be traded to connect them, but only time will tell how the world wishes to use this new technology.
