Just want to give a public thanks to BCI for its contribution to the community. Contrary to much trolling, satisfied customer over here. Please continue the good work.

The notion that bitcoin can be killed is pretty ridiculous, don't we think? Bitcoin is more an idea than a tangible currency that can be killed. At least to those that truly see. Beneath this mask there is more than flesh. Symbols are given power by people. Alone, a symbol is meaningless, but with enough people... Is humanity worthy of bitcoin? If so, it will succeed. If not... c'est la vie.

Do we have a link for Citizen Four yet? And is it relevant to this discussion? Friend keeps telling me to watch. Airing on HBO in a couple weeks I believe. Will wait for that if I must...

Bitcoin is as anonymous or public as the user chooses. If you're a company requiring new age public accounting then blockchain transactions is your game. If you're a private citizen valuing fourth amendment rights, then private cash purchase of paper wallets may be more up your alley.

I wish I was friends with you when I was a kid.

Mostly this. But what does "artificially scarce" mean? What is artificial? It is a consensus, agreed upon size. It is not completely arbitrary or artificial as I've come to know the word.
Also, this may be an idiot comment by me. I'm new here. Just trying to broaden my understanding.

Attempting to discredit an author's person before considering their content is... stop wasting your life.
Edit because I love my sister. Feminism.
