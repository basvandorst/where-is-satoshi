my guess is that $96.01 ≠ 8.737 BTC
not sure what i am looking at though

there are a couple of different people on bitcointalk trying to get some US-based assembly going with the avalon chips. you should just look into just getting in on a group order -- by the time you have those chips (in 10ish weeks), there will definitely be a domestic option.
it'd probably be cheaper just to buy your own chips (each costs about 0.078 BTC), and by the time you have them its safe to say they'll be reselling at a premium in the off-chance you don't want to end up using them to build.

i don't think much has changed since you were looking for free btc to use on silk road a month ago...
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:51:13
amen. i think once anyone actually looks into his track record or is made aware of his "customer service" / his pissy little posts on bitcointalk they will want little to do with him. 
guess he's not done with this "toxic community malformed by greed" just yet...

interesting. i had a sell a few weeks ago, and i noticed the price was jumping up by like $12-13 (to around the gox price) every once in a while, but would go back down within seconds. somehow managed to time it right and get a sell in at the higher price.
guess this may have been related... i was wondering how coinbase's pricing worked.

the next shirtoshi t-shirt? i'd buy it

This cannot be stated enough, especially if they account for most of your savings. While being stored in coinbase, your BTC are not technically "yours"
@_date: 2013-04-25 03:12:26
aren't two of the best things about Bitcoin the lack of transaction fees, and the impossibility of chargebacks? wouldn't using BTC through paypal totally nix these benefits? 
@_date: 2013-05-16 09:01:46
cool. thanks for your help
@_date: 2013-05-16 00:22:57
correct me if i'm wrong but the only thing that has changed about mt. gox is that they no longer accept dwolla transfers... 
mt. gox is still an option on bitinstant last i checked. i suggest your friend gets online/reads more/buys diapers like the other guy recommends

likewise. debiting my bank account works just fine this week, but i still have yet to see an ACH deposit i initiated on friday.

i've never had an issue &amp; have always received mine right around the quoted time &amp; date they give you when purchasing.
if you've already given them your bank info, why not just give them a cc# too? that instant buy is pretty handy
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:46:23
they're hardly criminals, but with all the funding they've received you'd think they could get their site to function properly at the times it really counts.
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:13:07
especially with gox fees
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:48:46
indeed, but a place that is pretty crappy for sellers/merchants. i've been screwed out of a significant amount of money by dishonest buyers over the past decade.

aw man, now i won't be able look forward to nearly as many posts from buffoons losing all their btc... what will i do
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:24:09
get out of here
@_date: 2013-05-14 04:01:37
so you only have $1.50 all together? you can buy fractions of btc, but the question is where -- since that is less than pretty much any fee you will pay when exchanging fiat for btc

so after replacing an old version will all my addresses automatically carry over to v0.8.2, or is there something more i need to do? 
@_date: 2013-05-15 21:37:23
i'm pretty sure it functions just fine. ever notice how the cost of btc on coinbase goes up by a few dollars anytime gox is down?
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:23:41
yeah, the site looks to be down altogether at the moment...
edit: they're sorry, guys. [ 
@_date: 2013-05-16 01:43:27
yeah, seriously. you'd think if it was a scam they'd at least bother with something professional-looking and possibly even use proper grammar -- pretty awful for "english college grads"
