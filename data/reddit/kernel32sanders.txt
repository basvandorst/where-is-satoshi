I'm going to get hate for this cuz neckbeards, but sign up for a coinbase account and being the waiting process for them to vet you. Sure, the prices are high, but it is the easiest way to buy crypto. Signing up for a binance account would be a good move as well, as confirmation of your account can take a long time. It's a little more technical, but a good place once you're a little more read up on how this all works.
In the meantime you should watch as many YouTube videos and read as many articles about how BTC works, what it is, ECT. Follow that up with researching info on wallets and how to store crypto securely. 
The waiting periods should allow you enough time to get a grounding in crypto and a general understanding of how it works before you jump in.
My two main takeaways would be: 1. Don't bother trying to day trade. You'll lose your ass, and that is almost guaranteed. 2. Don't watch YouTube channels with people who have extraordinary claims. Follow the boring, bland people who seem tepid about not throwing away money. CryptoTips is a good channel. She's really even keel, knows her shit, informative, and really fun to look at.

Yes, but crypto is a mess still with janky workarounds for wallets and way too many possibilities for huge errors and is way too open for malicious attacks. 
Also, I don't believe we will ever get away from something like the FDIC. People just won't be willing to risk losing everything through an attack or robbery, which crypto is still way too open to. We may pay for the attacks on large payment networks we currently use through fees and other fuckery by the baking institutions, but the vast majority of people are not going to be willing to risk trading those fees for not having that insurance. The fact that people are so scared to disclose their BTC holdings on Reddit proves how dysfunctional the whole system is still. 
Edit: this isn't to say I don't think we may see mass adoption someday, but I think of  the current state of crypto as the early stages of computing. It's has very powerful potential and could revolutionize the world, but it is way too clumsy and takes a pretty tech savvy person to fully understand.
