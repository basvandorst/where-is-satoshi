Been using it since 2 weeks or so. The order book is still a bit thin though. Looking forward for more people using the EUR exchange.

Hot stories like "China is banning all bitcoins for real this time" from throwaways?

Is it just me or is the "News" section on blockchain.info broken. 
Shows "Blockchains Reaction to Mt. Gox" 1 minute ago since days and the link is not working either.

+1 Watching that video makes me sick. What kind of room or office is this. None of those vintage Macs (weren't those PowerPC Macs?) is even connected.
I would never ever trust these people. Not that i trust Marc Zuckerborg more when he's standing in one of his state-of-the-art data-centers.

I guess the bank bailout in 2008 will top this. Thousands of families foreclosed, banks too big to fail.

Who would sell bitcoins at nearly 100 USD / Bitcoin?

Not for forget that those that know how to play the market will do just that. There isn't any regulation that prevent exchange owners from using their order book advantage. 
Bitcoin in its current state is not for the amateur trader. Just like this line in the brilliant poker movie Rounders: 


If Bitcoin has a future it will be bright and it won't matter at all if you bought your coins for 100, 200 or 600 USD a piece. So if you believe in Bitcoin keep your coins and forget about them for a few years and get on with your work - maybe to build up services or infrastructure for bitcoin. Just don't try to gamble with them as most likely others will outsmart you taking your coins.

I love reddit but never thought of paying for it.
But those times when other sites are unreachable and i can return to reddit to check the status. That's priceless.
I think everybody who uses this subreddit daily should consider buying reddit gold. Show the reddit developers some love for keeping such a great service up and running.

Imagine what would happen if the founders tried to sell those 100 billion now? The big difference to bitcoin is that all mined bitcoins are in the hands of the community while 99% of Ripple is not.

Just use Bitcoin.de. Register and buy from someone that offers inner-german Überweisung.

While i agree that expensive weddings might be a waste. Children offer the best return you can get in life. Apart from money they require a lot of your time. A lot. They bring more smiles and happiness than you can ever imagine - even with BTC being at 1000 USD.
Good luck with your Bitcoins.

Yep, i don't understand why Mtgox does not put in a simple limit of the number of trades a single user can do. It would probably solve most of those bot created lag spikes of 0.02 BTC trades.

The fact that 100 billion coins are pre-printed and in the hands of the founding company should be a big enough red flag for everybody to not touch Ripple. Nuff said.

I bought back before the first crash at around $30 and felt stupid for several months. Don't worry bitcoin is here to stay. I'm still keeping most of my bitcoins and only use them when i buy something. I actually got some pretty good deals by suggesting to pay via bitcoin with some merchants.
