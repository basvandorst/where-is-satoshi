I'm thinking about purchasing a "CASA"?  Do I need to have something other than a router to be up and running?

Maybe some people invested only what they were willing to lose. Why would you sell at a lost if that is the case? Let it ride.  Not everybody has invested their entire future into this... so relax.

yeah! (pitchfork in hand)

I agree. A major reason is that the masses don't understand it and it is not that easy for the common everyday uneducated "in tech" person to get involved.  Also, people don't like change. 95% of the people around me talk crypto down and they have no clue what it's even about.  When I first heard of BTC (June of 2017) I thought "oh that's too expensive (not knowing about satoshi's) let me look for the cheaper Crypto that maybe will be the next big thing" and bought ETH instead. Now I understand it a "little better" and how BTC is different from all other cryptos.  Its just going to take some time.  A lot of time, money and effort is still being put into this, to make it user-friendly.  All these wallets coming out are still being tweaked to make it that way.  It's not a matter of "if" its "when". Congrats to all of those that got in at the beginning.

Is that why the price is able to dip below the actual cost to mine one?  Which I have always read was around 4800. So if these losers are selling off a bunch of bitcoin to fight their personal battle the supply becomes so high that miners are not needed right now?

thats what the usdc is.

And the Phoenix begins to rise. Damn should have bought at 4300. lol

Dear Whales,
Please drop the price lower so that I can buy more.
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:22:00
Get your cryptoart.  IMO it will be worth big bucks someday since they only make limited pieces. What do you guys think? [
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:52:07
Will the "coinbase" wallet on my phone suffice for tomorrow?
@_date: 2019-01-26 23:45:05
I say that every time it goes up $100.

A little confused here about the whole mining and 21 million coin thing.... how many are left to be mined?  and will there be a day when mining stops because all 21million have been mined? and what about the lost ones?
Laymens term please.

you suck at math
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:52:26
That's what I was thinking.  Its a blessing in disguise, IMO.

Does anybody know of a "bitcoin" type craigslist or Let it go,  marketplace?
@_date: 2018-12-24 23:21:21
A major hurdle that will have to be overcome.
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:04:14
Guessing?... I was referring to bitcoin and the fact that you thought for over 47 years I or anyone for that matter would continue to put money into bitcoin with no results and the hopes of it becoming something.  Thanks for the known info.  Doesn't sway me from taking a shot at something new and unknown.
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:11:29
I'm predicting that your prediction may be right or wrong.
@_date: 2018-12-24 23:11:56
Bought myself a cryptoart for Christmas. Kind of excited about it.  Happy Holidays everyone.

BTC is not my only investment. $100 a pay (bi-weekly) is not much to me.  Avg people spend $100 easily on alcohol and entertainment every week.  If bitcoin is going to be something it will show within the next couple years.... not 47yrs of guessing and hoping.  To each their own...again I view the upside potential worth the risk.  Good day Sir.

I find it funny how people are so concerned with how others are investing their money.  If someone wants to invest say $100 dollars a paycheck into something that could possibly give them a great return then so be it.  Why waste your time attacking people, putting them down and making comments about the outcome of their investment when you don't really have a clue of what the future will hold.  No one's going to be able to tell me "I told you so" because I've invested what I could afford to lose anyway.  So its either going to pay off nicely or I will just be in the same position I've been in any way. Good luck to all!

Hopefully, I'll be able to buy my next house with it.

So have you predicted all these up and downs since inception? Is 3K not excellent growth from .10? What should everyone do with "THEIR" money to be as successful as you and be able to hang out on here. Because you sound like you have life all figured out.

One day my friend, one day and it will be glorious!
