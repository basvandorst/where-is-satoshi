Honestly this is the only metric I'm watching for figuring out when it's time to buy. Before 90% dominance there's every chance we're going to see more price crashes, until we have a clean house.

tbh because I already have like 4 apps for sending my phone contacts money. it’s a solved problem. 
good luck in your endeavor. I hope you find a good angle.

Yet another custodial wallet?
I don't mind custodial wallets for small txs. But what's new about this one?

You can use [Bisq](

You should reconsider using them. I recommend Bisq.

Which operating system?
Which server are you currently connected to?
Mine is currently connected to [blkhub.net]( (block height 603601) FWIW.
@_date: 2019-11-13 17:45:43
Are you able to use a terminal?
I would try testing the connection to any of those servers at port 50002.
e.g. `nc -z some.server 50002`
(you'll need netcat installed)
It's possible that someone's blocking this outgoing port on your network.
You can also just paste that address in your browser bar (e.g. `some.server:50002`) and see whether you're getting an empty response (means you're at least getting through) or simply getting a "connection refused".

If you're read through all Satoshi wrote on Bitcointalk and consider the infamous "if you don't believe me" quote to be representative of his online demeanor then I guess we'll have to just disagree.
Satoshi's niceness score online is basically 99.9%
Szabo's score is like 30%, well into asshole territory.

When did “grumpy” become the euphemism for asshole? This space lacks people who can communicate and debate properly. Instead, the smartest guys behave online like children in a playground. Hurling memes at each other and blocking anyone who disagrees with them. 
This space needs the likes of Hitchins. Even Dawkins. Sam Harris. People who are erudite and knowledgeable but also polite, articulate and yet brutal and unflinching in their debates. 
Satoshi came off as one of the nicest people to communicate with online. Read Book of Satoshi if you haven’t already. Could not be Szabo, unless he deserves also an Oscar for playing an asshole so perfectly.

try without the .server part. that was just an example of a server hostname. try with some server from the list in your ethereum.

idk electrum still seems simpler to use than that... but in any case, both are still entirely too technical and complicated for people without a technical background. this is a very cool tool for enthusiasts, but OP's title is really stretching it.

As expected a counter example as it is unique. Go read Book of Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-11-02 12:14:53
I agree he was way more polite than his typical online self. However he’s still no where the caliber of the aforementioned intellectuals in terms of discourse ability. Just imagine Chris Hitchins shilling bitcoin... how epic would that be. Then think back at “number go up” and what passes around here for memology or pomp vs. schiff as what passes for debate. Depressing. 
Ironically, Satoshi himself was a great explainer and argued very pointedly with those around at the time. He would have probably made a great public face/educator. If it weren’t for the security risk...
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:58:28
not quite. Initially there were no central banks, just commercial banks iirc. According to Rothbard’s History of money and banking in the USA.
In fact there was a period prior to banking, when mostly foreign coins were used:
“It is important to realize that gold and silver are international commodities, and that therefore, when not prohibited by government decree, foreign coins are perfectly capable of serving as standard moneys. There is no need to have a national government monopolize the coinage, and indeed foreign gold and silver coins constituted much of the coinage in the United States until Congress outlawed the use of foreign coins in 1857.”

Technically, the paper was created from the working prototype, on which Satoshi worked for about 1.5 years prior.

Hard to argue with that. But similar sentiments were voiced in the early days of the internet, too. Yet somehow everybody's figured it our 30 years later. It'll probably take that long for Bitcoin as well. A new generation will grow up with these skills.

I think the halvening cannot be “priced in” completely, otherwise Satoshi wouldn’t have sent Hal all those coins for free, and Gavin wouldn’t have been giving them away during 2010 :)
It clearly has to do with the degree of global adoption. 
I think there’s also a Lindy effect in play, in a way. Each halvening is basically proof that Bitcoin survived and thrived for 4 more years, which increases its chances of surviving further. If you buy at today’s price your basically betting on 10yo Bitcoin being successful as a store of value. If you buy 40 years from now, regardless of scarcity/circulation really, you’re buying something a lot more proven, and the price should reflect that.

I honestly think at this stage it’s more up to macro events than anything else. Fiat currencies crashing, rogue states ditching the USD and hoard/mine ₿ - that sort of the stuff. Nothing to do but sit and wait for the collapse of the legacy monetary system.

Great stuff.
I used to use SSS to store my wallet seed, but I switched to 3-5 multisig (one of which is a Trezor, btw), because with multisig there's no point in time when the entire key☨ is present in one location.
☨ not exactly key, but you get the point - enough information to control the funds.

meh the hell with etfs. short term the price will go up, but nothing like it would with grassroots adoption.  institutional investors won’t hodl. it’s just going to increase volatility and introduce counter party risk.

Exactly 0% of Bitcoin or Lightning’s security comes from any formal proof of their correctness. The reason they are secure is that they’re the biggest bug bounty on the planet that has yet to be collected. No grey beard reviewing and pontificating about the ostensible correctness of the project is necessary, and as it turns out hasn’t actually contributed to it in any way. 
So this is a bullshit vanity metric - number of professors that blessed the project ��
With enough funding they probably would have blessed ethereum classic as well.
