Microsoft is probably the closest.  there are a lot of technical issues in creating a public utility like that.
OpenChain is something to look at for transaction anchoring with business logic,
Other services/companies to look at are factom for your blockchain datalayer with faster confirmation times etc.
I mean, technically speaking, Bitcoin is it's own public cloud offering.
I'm guessing you think you're too far behind to catch-up with syncing the blockchain to your machine (or don't have storage space for it)...
What are you wanting/trying to do?  that has a big impact on what you need
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:50:50
nah, I'm just throwing it out there for the slowpokes.  It's easy for us.  Ultimately, the bank's employees start to learn, and it sits in their mind, and like any good idea, it starts to take form, and people start to learn, and their eyes open up.  and they say, "why are these people still talking about bitcoin?" and they say "haha! lol!  this is a hilarious drama,  and they say "hmm, I wonder why people still talk about this, isn't it dead?"  and then they meet someone, and they ask "Isn't Bitcoin Dead?"  And that person they ask, looks back at them, stares them straight in the eyes, and says "Bitcoin will never die." and that person's whole worldview will crumble, they will start to dig, they will start to sift through the bullshit, and look for "what in the actual fuck do people see in this?" and at the end of their journey, they're going to find out the simplicity, the power, and the honesty there is behind it.  They will dissociate it from it's shit-colored wrapper, see it for what it is, and find a piece of gold.  And then we win.
They Have No Chance.

I just notified a person who I know is affiliated with Kraken.  They should be able to forward your request to the right people.
I hope it gets resolved.  They are being honest on the M&amp;A side of stuff.  You can check the recent news.
I have no reason to suspect they are up to anything bad... just... lots of work to be done.  Bear with them!

worked with a philosopher/CS engineer on technical feasibility - made significant contributions.
Theology? "Does god exist?"  and the answer is a resounding yes.  
not sure what you're implying vis-à-vis theology.  if you want me to defend my position, I can, but I'm not here to argue over the merits of the existence of an identity that is "god".  To me, it is a silly question.
@_date: 2015-08-10 18:56:22
Move to Texas! Low taxes, easy to start a business, relatively low regulatory hurdles.  Not to mention that Austin is a huge hub for bitcoin activity.  And Houston is an international business hub...  
  
but that's just my opinion
@_date: 2015-08-03 20:13:55
to use one question and his answer (from the interview) to write-off the entire interview is false cause.  All I asked was if you would explain what you mean - what supports your position?
  
"Self-evident" is questionable, but I'll let it slide for the sake of argument.  What is true for you, may not be (and likely isn't) true for everyone.
  
I'm not making any false pretenses, *I simply asked what you mean*.  What supports the judgement of "incompetence", and how could that be remedied? what could be different to make you feel differently.  
  
Please teach me what went wrong and how we can fix this problem.  I will convey your comments and concerns to the appropriate person.  
  
edit: you can see PKirby's response in this thread. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 17:38:15
I don't see how what he said shows that he "knows shockingly little about what he is doing"
Can someone explain this to me?
edit:  what i'm really getting at is that I think the title is a bit sensationalist...

Said it once, I'll say it again... Move to texas.  No Bitlicense, Cheap cost of living...  
  
For those who want to move to California (SV) you still fall under a money transmitter license which is basically the same thing as the bitlicense in cost and information to be provided.  
  
it's a racket.

I commented below, but can you explain what you mean?
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:37:30
yea, I see this too, but if you're trying to start a bitcoin business, states are proving that regulation has a huge impact on innovation.
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:23:15
I thought his explanation by analogy was pretty good.  
tcp/ip -&gt; http == bitcoin-&gt;factom, 
Mozilla -&gt; Mozilla Foundation == factom inc. -&gt; Factom Foundation 
I mean, if you wanted to have a talk about code, this isn't the forum for it, he's at a banker's conference, so shouldn't he be talking in terms of what matters for bankers? scalability of large transaction volumes that are immutable on the Blockchain?

I'm in Houston Myself... moved here from Austin in January.  
  
Houston in good - the job market is "scared" because Oil companies are laying people off, but still a good place for IT... comparatively speaking Houston has fewer IT people per capita than Austin - rent's are cheap if you are willing to live in a suburban area
@_date: 2015-08-03 20:41:50
To be clear, I am A, single, one, unitary, community manager out of a whole group of them.  Just trying to get to the bottom of things so they can be addressed appropriately.  By the looks of your name, I'm guessing you are a fanatic for Counterparty, so... you really can't make a straw man out of me....
    
I see the words you are using, and I don't think there was anything he said that warrants the sensationalist title.  Not to mention that it's a wholly unsupportable claim that "he knows shockingly little about what he's doing"  
  
Not to mention that for a general audience, none of his answers were that bad...  I think you're trying to throw out the baby with the bathwater, the bathtub, the plumbing system, all because someone said something that was only slightly offputting to your delicate sensibilities.  
  
For example, if I wanted to call someone an idiot, I would do it to their face, not make some BS sensationalist title and vote brigade the post to the top. yeah... that'll show 'em.      
  
What you have posted is similar to the following:
"If he doesn't know the perfect response to this pretty technical question on the spot, then everything else he says is bullshit" isn't a valid argument.
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:33:15
yea.  It probably would have been better if he said "the base price is .1 copper - the federated servers set a market price to process the transactions, and the factoids are what give authority to do the entry."

Right in the feels bro. Too soon.
  
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:18:18
I'm pretty sure the business case is securing large volumes of transactions in a short period of time - all of which are hashed to the Blockchain, thereby making it immutable.
edit: I guess there is some "reading between the lines" I'm missing.  Nothing really seemed out of the ordinary.
@_date: 2015-08-03 21:12:09
thank you.

I think the Factom folks found one of the centers of gravity for all cryptocurrency... indisputable record keeping.   
  
That's one thing that everyone touts about bitcoin, but until Factom, no one has had a means to actually accomplish this in a way that's practical to the world at-large.  
  
Looking forward to hearing more about this partnership.
