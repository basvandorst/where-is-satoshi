Think of all the mainstreamers that put a lot of money in at peak for an investment and want to cut their losses, I predict it going down even further tomorrow once they figure out how to sell.

I always tell people not to buy when the price is high and rising fast, but when everything is calm and low. It's for sure that it'll crash and a lot of people will be devastated, the hype will die for a bit and the only question is when. (Might already be starting right now)
Terrible time to invest as the value is highly volatile.

It's all speculation. There's never a good time to buy, nor a bad time.
People will say that at thousand milestones is when a drop occurs. 
But no one knows for sure.
And if someone does know, send me over some bitcoins since you're so certain.
Besides this, there will probably be a huge crash. I think it's bound to happen in a hugely speculative market that's gone up way too high too fast. 
What will happen when 10k hits and there's a huge sell off and not a lot of demand buying since they're waiting for a dip? Domino effect of people selling outpacing buyers, lowering price. 
But hey, that might be why I'm not a millionaire. Have to find that risk/luck balance.

I'd say invest in some books. That'll be a better investment than bitcoin. Your best investment is in yourself. You can put a little bit on it like $20, and watch as it falls and goes up. Once you have residual income, that's when you want to invest!

Pretty much all of the above.

It will drop down a lot more, until everyone forgets about the hype train in a couple of months. That's the best time to buy, when everything is boring.
No point buying right after a drop because the price is still hyped and people are saving their bitcoins. You'll still get your ROI in time, but it'll be a lot slower.
Key is patience to see that Bitcoin is in steady growth and not the inflated price it is now. Check out the charts from 2013 - it'll drop for 2 to 3 months until price is stable again and will steadily rise.

Yeah, people just have to relax and just enjoy a nice cold beer. :)
You're a great guy mate.
