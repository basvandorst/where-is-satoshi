  Tradehill was killed by the dwolla thing.
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:56:20
Speaking of MtGox, is that whole situation resolved yet?  Is there a thread with all the info?  Last I heard, they opened a useless call center.
@_date: 2012-02-14 16:16:32
What -- with Dwolla?  Really?  Can you fill  me in?
@_date: 2012-02-14 16:17:44
What happened with the 100k?
@_date: 2012-02-14 23:40:20
Wow, crazy.  Thanks.  But if Dwolla was violating their own policies, how come TH could never get the money back?

Thanks for that link to Dan's response.  Although I'm not sure he's saying what you think he is.

Pasting announcement here since the text is not wrapping and scrolling is annoying:
"::::: Announcement :::::: TradeHill suspending trading and returning client funds.
 Dear Clients,
Effective immediately TradeHill will be shutting down trading / deposits and returning all client funds.
Due to increasing regulation TradeHill can not operate in it's current capacity without proper money transmission licensing. Combined with multiple bank account closures and Paxum's decision to close all Bitcoin business accounts, we have deemed the best course of action is to halt trading and pursue licensing while raising funds.
SEPA transfers for our Euro customers have been enabled.
Everyone at TradeHill has also been working without pay for several months after one of our payment processors removed over $100,000 dollars from our account without notice. We decided to cover this loss for now instead of passing it on to our customers and are taking legal action against the processor. We would also like to make it known that our relationship with Paxum has been great and hope to work with them in the future.
We will be focusing on Bitcoin.com and are preparing to release a new site before the end of the month.
It has been a pleasure working with the Bitcoin community and look forward to continuing our business in the future. More details to come soon.
Jered Kenna
Chief Executive Officer
TradeHill

The most interesting response:
Dear Bitcointalk members,
Thank you for your active participation in this thread. We're now working on the official response regarding this matter and hopefully we can clear things up.
Meanwhile, we want to make clear a few things:
- Bitcoinica is no longer a product of xWaylab Inc., and we no longer operate in the jurisdiction of Delaware. We have registered a new entity outside of United States and we are now a fully licensed financial services provider in that country. (We will announce our new corporate structure with proof of financial services license available from a government site.)
- Bitcoinica is a Bitcoin CFD (Contract For Difference) trading platform, not a bucket shop. Even though our trading facilities don't deliver actual Bitcoins, there is actual trading of Bitcoins among Bitcoinica customers or at other exchanges. The benefit of trading CFDs instead of Bitcoins is the possibility of margin trading of commodity-like assets, instead of contract-like assets. The underlying trading process is absolutely legal.
- We have a legal deadline for doing KYC procedures, and currently we are still far from that. However, we are considering requiring identification documents from our customers. We will launch a poll to hear your voices.
It's surprising that the OP didn't give us more than 3 days to announce the changes at the corporate side of Bitcoinica, and this thread has forced us to put aside our technical development and focus on the legal problems right away. We will address these issues soon."

I haven't heard about this.  Is there somewhere you would recommend going to read about it?  I'm curious.
@_date: 2012-02-14 00:10:44
Fake volume?  What's that mean?
@_date: 2011-04-03 15:21:06
me too!

@_date: 2013-01-25 01:08:43
Exactly.  Also, it seems most discussions I see are about investment (such as this one) leading me to think most people are investing, but I'd be interested to know the real answer not one tinged by my accidental selection.

You probably can't buy an island with btc.  Assuming one has millions in ill-gotten btc, it is currently going to be difficult to get that into another currency. Also doing so will likely create a paper trail.
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:33:00
I stand corrected about the island.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-02-03 05:45:13


Interesting.  But you'd have to convince me it has predictive power, not just that you can fit things in the past to it.
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:14:13
Ah, wow!  Thanks for the explanation!!  Makes sense!  And thanks for the gold.
Vault sounds better anyways.

Previously you had  and now you have  ?  A little confused why you don't have the old domain (which I see by clicking through your links) forward to the new one instead of 404. 
Nice job on the website though, lookin good and good luck.  I like hearing about the effort you have made in squashing bugs.
