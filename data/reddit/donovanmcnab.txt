LPT use outline.com and copy and paste the url into there. That website has been invaluable to my time researching crypto.

Hm that’s super interesting angle as well. With the recent confirmation of the wanna cry virus linked to North Korea, blockchain analysis tools should be able to detect if those particular wallets are being involved in the high frequency transactions.

Peter Schiff has his own podcast and did an entire episode on bitcoin. 
I think it's an important exercise to hear both sides of the coin. While I see flaws in his logic about the inherent value of bitcoin, I tend to agree that when there is nothing grounding said asset, the value becomes heavily reliant on speculation which can lead to volatility. 
One thing that he fails to acknowledge is the network effect. IF bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gain mainstream adoption (we are nowhere close to mainstream adoption) the prices will rise and then eventually stabilize.

Hm I've used bitcoin to purchase a trezor and signed up for a shift debit card as a backup in case I travel (no travel restrictions). I think the biggest reason I don't use it more often is the tax implications. Every time you spend your bitcoin you have to calculate the net profit or loss on the realized value of your bitcoin. The hassle of worrying about keeping track of capital gains tax on a $5 latte? No thanks...

No, this is good FOR Bitcoin

Just a fun fact, Japanese "karē" is not exactly Indian food. Well, by just like American pizza is not Italian. The British introduced the Japanese to curry during the Meiji era 1860-1900. This was the same time they colonized India . So karē has been around for quite some time and eventually evolved to what it is today. I would consider karē as much Indian as say pizza would be considered Italian. Cheers!

Great just purchased one last week, my first bitcoin purchase. Can't wait to get it, but the entire setup sounds daunting for a novice. Are the setup instructions fairly user friendly?

I'm flying out to Tokyo next week, I'm interested in how you go about paying with bitcoin in Japan. Do they give you a receipt with a qr code, or do they just give you an address and you send the funds from your wallet? I've heard that bitcoin is now a legal means to pay for things, how prevalent is bitcoin out there? What % of shops accept bitcoin? How long did the confirmation of payment take? 
Thanks!

Just a guess, but from a regulatory stance I'm thinking it could get a little dicey when you start accepting bitcoins. Since they are a money transmitter they probably need to adhere to local and federal laws. Bitxoins are a grey area to ppl who regulate money transmitters and other money service businesses. If you operate in a single state, it's easy, you can just get he proper licenses for that state, when you operate globally, that's a different story. Hence coinbase use to restrict purchasing in certain states and countries, they are a company that revolves around bitcoin so it's part of their business model. Airbnb probably can and eventually will,but I'm guessing they are waiting o the sidelines until the regulators figure out how to regulate this new crytocurrwncy. Again, this is just my assumption, would love to hear some other opinions
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:48:22
I'm aware of the strict laws that money service remittance businesses have to adhere to, "know your customer" and customer information requests, what purpose does it serve for them to track coins beyond those regulatory requirements? 
@_date: 2017-05-09 06:40:06
What's a tracking token?

Wondering if the pseudonym of the creator is contributing to the popularity of Bitcoin in Japan

I also had some issues buying some ether the other day, the transaction was suppose to clear by the 8th but it just showed up in my account today. It's frustrating but when you purchase the coins you are locked in at the rate at the one of purchase. I don't think there is any nefariousness that is going on behind closed doors, they're doing a great service by making Bitcoin accessible to everyday ppl. I think scaling a platform as ambitious as coinbase, there will be some growing pains. I think we should wxcercise a little patience. 
I may be wrong, but I doubt they track our coins to the same extent that some of the community believes. They need to cover their asses so that they can stay complaint with fed laws, but beyond that, what incentive is there to monitor every transaction?
Mayb I'm a bit naive or too optimistic
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:26:18
Nice do you just transfer with your bitcoin wallet? How long does the transaction take to confirm? I'm going to Japan soon and intend on using bitcoin whenever possible.

What are the tax implications for being paid on bitcoin? Is it as simple as paying both income tax and than capital gains tax if your holdings appreciate when you realize the gains?
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:12:27
Awesome just arrived yesterday. When I get a chance to be a tourist I will most definitely try and pay via btc 
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:41:57
At the moment you cant directly walk up to the Starbucks cashier and pay by transferring your bitcoins to them. As previously mentioned, you are able to either purchase a Starbucks gift card with bitcoin, alternatively they do have Visa cards that are connected to your bitcoin wallet ( but that's essentially visa just exchanging your bitcoin to fiat). We haven't gotten to a point where it is easy and convenient and most importantly  cost effective to use bitcoin wherever you want. Hopefully soon... 
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:15:58
Easier to take money and tax free?? Capital gains tax...
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:51:51
More likely more than 75%...

coinbase ico... now theres an idea
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:56:50
I definitely feel this same sentiment. This rivalry has always been strange to me. I believe its mutually beneficial for both coins to flourish. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:29:15
Yes, I second this. How would one go about searching that information?
