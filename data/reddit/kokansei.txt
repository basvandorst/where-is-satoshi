The article is written by a Chinese bitcoin trader who is convinced that the recent bull market in BTC was primarily driven by Chinese interest in MMM. He started going long on BTC while keeping his eye on various Chinese MMM groups to gauge sentiment with the intention of selling / shorting BTC once the MMM ponzi started to implode.
Today the trader saw that the MMM groups are panicking because the scheme has started to implode. The people running the scheme have promised to resume withdrawals by Jan 5th (lol, yeah right) and all the "participants" in the ponzi are unable to get their cash out. The collapse of the scheme appears to be global, not just limited to China as initially thought. When the trader went to start selling / shorting bitcoin, he found that the price had already started to decrease and he sold some off around 2900, but he couldn't resist buying back in around 2700.

You are either a malicious liar or an idiot.
Show me where the original tweet regarding Coinbase's switch away from core is still up. That's right you can't because it was deleted despite being highly upvoted. This is the very definition of censorship: removal of information against the wishes of the vast majority. 
Why has this sub started corralling all discussion of the most important issue facing bitcoin today into a very limited number of threads? Why have the mods recently disabled the display of post scores and often changed the default order of posts to make it more difficult to ascertain the mood of the community?
The above actions are nothing but a desperate attempt to control the discourse of this community, an attempt that will inevitably fail despite all the power and illegitimate authority thrown at stifling the free flow of information and despite the existence of useful idiots and shills like you.

This is a huge oversimplification. Unless the state is willing to transition to a complete command economy, which would immediately put it at a disadvantage in the war, it must play within the "ruleset" of capitalism or the entire system implodes.
Saying you don't need currency to make weapons because the currency doesn't actually make the weapons is the same fallacy as saying you don't need a factory boss or management because the workers make all the widgets - there is a whole hidden infrastructure of resource management and information transmission that you are ignoring when you make such claims.


Currency is a way of bookkeeping among every single economic actor in a given system. It is both the lifeblood and nervous system of the entire economy. When you give the state power over the currency, you give it tremendous power to distort (or completely destroy) the system as a whole, which is one of the main reasons our society is currently so incredibly fucked up.

Bitcoin absolutely has the power to stop state acquisition of assets, at least to some degree. It is much easier to simply borrow / print currency to finance a war than it is to convince the proles to buy war bonds. This same logic applies to almost any expenditure of the state, not just war.
The size of the government would be significantly smaller if it did not have control over the money supply because it would actually have to acquire money before spending it like the rest of us mortals.

Personally I have never understood why Russia has not been more proactive in promoting bitcoin since the current global domination of central banks heavily favors its Western rivals. Yes, mass adoption of bitcoin would cause Russia to lose control of its own currency to a certain degree, but Russia does not need to control and issue its own currency in order to maintain an out-sized empire like the US currently does. Russia promoting bitcoin would technically be bad for the Russian government from a monetary sovereignty point of view, but it would be potentially catastrophic for the US government, so it is arguably still in their interests to promote bitcoin.
My best guess is that the right people in the Russian leadership are just beginning to understand the strategic implications of this technology.

This is pure bullshit. You're talking about a theoretical scenario that hasn't occurred so far in bitcoin's 6-year history and whether or not anyone with even several billion dollars in capital at their disposal could cripple bitcoin permanently is very much an open question.
If the big bad government was truly omnipotent and smart, they would have killed bitcoin a long time ago, since the longer they wait, the greater the probability that bitcoin completely devours their monopoly on money. The fact that they haven't done anything meaningful up to this point means that they either don't have the physical means or (more likely) they are simply not smart and coordinated enough to recognize and neutralize the bitcoin threat. Contrary to what Hollywood tells us, governments are generally slow, incompetent and incapable of solving even very simple problems.

I don't think the author provides enough evidence in the article to support this claim, quite frankly. The changes proposed by Gavin will not go through without a 75% supermajority - that is, the distribution of the code and decision as to whether or not to run it will necessarily be decentralized. 
The author also takes a long time explaining why the approach taken by Gavin is wrong without really proposing any alternative vision, unless that alternative vision is "let's just leave the arbitrary 1 MB cap in place until every singe user and contributor to bitcoin agrees on an alternative," which is just plain silly. Personally, I will be running the updated version of Bitcoin core when the time comes and anyone who cares about the network's short term scalability should do the same.
It's clear the rivets on the existing financial system are coming off at an accelerating pace, and bitcoin will need to have a suitable level of transaction volume capacity when the time comes if it is to succeed. That time may not be very far away.

It's probably most accurate to say that Bitcoin is not constantly enforced austerity but constantly enforced *responsibility*. When the government cannot run up absurd debts by manipulating the monetary system, austerity becomes unnecessary because the system is self-correcting in the first place.
It's essentially the same as sobriety versus having a hangover. Bitcoin forces sobriety on the government. You cannot have a hangover if your monetary system prevents you from going on a bender in the first place.

I have a pet theory about bitcoin trolls, which I'm sure they won't like:
*Dons armchair anthropologist cap*
I think that a sizable number of trolls may have once held bitcoin or seriously considered holding bitcoin at some point. In short, the typical troll (or at least one archetype thereof) was at some point psychologically invested in bitcoin in a way that is probably similar to the typical bitcoin-positive person.
However, unlike most bitcoin-positive people, these trolls at some point become disillusioned with bitcoin due to some event or frustration. One example of such an event might be selling all one's bitcoin in frustration as a result of a price decline, hence explaining why we tend to see more bitcoin trolls during long drawn out bear markets. Another example might be a catastrophic loss of one's bitcoin savings due to a failure to hold private keys or store them properly (this includes people who got Goxed, etc.). In any case, the resulting "disillusionment" with bitcoin causes the proto-bitcoin troll to change his or her entire attitude toward bitcoin as a psychological defense mechanism that reconciles the trauma of whatever event caused a loss in the drive to support bitcoin. Just as the harshest, bitterest critics of a company, organization or ideology tend to be people who were once positively invested in said company, organization or ideology, so too are the bitterest critics of bitcoin often formerly positively invested in the idea of bitcoin.
In addition to the above, I also think there is a substantial population of trolls who have never been psychologically invested in bitcoin in a positive way, but who dislike bitcoin on ideological grounds. These trolls typically do not understand bitcoin at a fundamental level, but they see certain ideological language in which conflicts with their own views. The best example I can think of is the anti-libertarian, pro-state or pro-status quo crowd who like to use name-calling ("Ron Paul fun bux," etc.) in the same way that rabid fans of Rush Limbaugh like to resort to immature name calling to belittle people who espouse different views.
Finally, there are some people who just enjoy trolling for the sake of trolling. For them, it is a form of recreation. This last class of trolls is not unique to the bitcoin community, of course, but the above two archetypes definitely are and I think they go a long way in accounting for the unusually high number of trolls we see here.

Language is not exactly analogous to currency or bitcoin.
First of all, bitcoin will succeed because it is needed. The current global monetary system underpinned by the US dollar has been dysfunctional for some time and there is an urgent need for something superior. Bitcoin is that something.
On the other hand, the current global standard for human to human communication, English, is already a pretty decent solution to the problem of international communication and a synthetic language like Esperanto does not provide any killer bitcoin-like advantages over English that would compel people to adopt it.

Rogoff, Krugman and their ilk are nothing but academically and intellectually dishonest voodoo chieftains perpetuating the catastrophically massive fraud that is modern central banking. To give you an idea of just how ignorant and out of touch Krugman is with reality, he has been on the record as calling bitcoin "[evil]( (WTF?) and also stated, in 1998, that "[by 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's](
Yet despite their staggering ignorance and lack of vision, every statement made by these pseudo-scientific charlatans is received as gospel by equally ignorant leaders around the world, despite the fact that they have been, and continue to be, consistently wrong on numerous critical issues. If you don't believe me, [just look at how a 10 minute conversation between Krugman and the Japanese prime-minister, Shinzo Abe caused the latter to postpone a sales tax increase in Japan that was intended to preserve the fiscal integrity of the Japanese government]( which currently holds a [debt to GDP ratio of 237.9%]( far an away higher than any other modern nation on this planet.
The fact that these frauds are given so much power over the modern economy and finance is a perfect example of the need for bitcoin and the crypto-anarchy which it will beget. Human beings are infinitely fallible and no one person should ever have the prerogative of interfering with an honest free market voluntarily established between consenting parties.
"Vires in Numeris" - strength in math or numbers, *not* the half-baked proclamations of high priests. This is not just the slogan of bitcoin, but the slogan of every form of substantial progress that the human race has ever made. Mathematically incorruptible accounting, protected via cryptography is bitcoin's biggest innovation and anyone who tells you that bitcoin is not political has an impoverished understanding of either bitcoin or how the world works (or both). Bitcoin is a quiet revolution that will be heard loud and clear around the world.

Bring on the downvotes, but I'm going to say it anyway: while I sympathize that you got scammed and sincerely hope you are able to recover your money (as unlikely as that is), part of the new and exciting world of cryptocurrency is being informed, vigilant and responsible with your money.
There is no such thing as increased freedom without increased risk and therefore increased responsibility to manage said risk. The whole reason why our monetary and political system is as completely fucked up as it is, is that people have preferred, for a long time, to mandate the offloading of responsibility for securing and managing their money and lives to third parties, resulting in increasingly centralized control and manipulation of markets and thereby subverting natural market equilibrium.
When one of us, any of us, goes crying to the authorities because we need to be "protected" from our own ignorance, laziness or lack of responsibility, we are doing nothing more than surrendering our freedom and dignity as free-thinking responsible and intelligent agents. When someone decides that they no longer want to take responsibility for something and asks for centralized protection "from themselves," they don't just hurt themselves, they hurt everybody who wants increased freedom and are prepared to pay the price for that freedom.
Freedom - real freedom - means having the freedom to fuck up. Trying to blame Google or some other third party, including the government, for your own actions (after all, you voluntarily gave your information to the phishers, no one forced you at gunpoint) is no better than AIG or any other large financial institution crying to policymakers because they can't deal with the consequences of their own actions. Only be dealing with the consequences of our own actions and, like intelligent human beings, learning from them, can we move forward.

This is completely unrelated to the discussion here, but watching bitcoin closely and thinking about the concept of money over the last month or so has made me realize something: faith and religion seem to be tied inexorably to the concept of money and in a sense the two may be analogous in some respects.
"In God we trust," "full faith and credit" and now "praise the Blockchain." The almost religious reverence that a lot of people have for money is really interesting.
Now that I think about it, as someone who has never much cared for religion or the supernatural, I think developing an enthusiasm for bitcoin is the closest I've ever come to joining a religion.
Someone needs to start a "Church of Satoshi" that regards adding transactions to the blockchain (the "One True Blockchain") as an inviolable sacrament. Mark my words if bitcoin blows up there is going to be an "L. Ron Hubbard" type who tries to capatalize on bitcoin by creating a full-blown religion around it.
On that note, I think I now have a backup plan if my dayjob doesn't work out. ;)

Agreed. I have yet to hear a truly convincing argument that deflation is "bad" made by a "trained economist." They will tell you "sticky wages," "reduced investment," "psychologically unfeasible," etc. but that's all bullshit. 
What they really fear is that, as mentions, deflation would basically mean the collapse of the debt-based fiat system that *they created artificially through the abhorrent edifice of central banking.* It would mean that the U.S. government would have to default under its crushing debt and it would be the end of the financial system as we know it.
It should not be surprising that the people who are at the helm of the system will do everything in their power to maintain it, *even if maintaining said system is not in the interests of humanity or the common man.*
That's where bitcoin comes in. A bitcoin-only economy will thrive in the inevitable death of fiat and all of humanity will be richer for it, having thrown off the yolk of their former masters: the middlemen who have captured our monetary system at the expense of the populace and the free market.

Thanks for your sincere reply. I suppose if you are convinced that a deflationary currency is a bad idea then there there really isn't much more that can be discussed, so if that's your reason for rejecting bitcoin as a viable solution to the problem of organizing human activity, fair enough. I think that most advocates of bitcoin do not see the (eventual) constant supply of bitcoin as a problem, probably because there are examples of productive economies with deflationary currencies throughout human history.
I'm assuming by *odd* beliefs you mean libertarian/an-cap/anti-state beliefs? I agree that many of these beliefs (I would call them ideologies) sound strange at first glance, but you must also acknowledge that there are a lot of very thoughtful people who hold these beliefs and there is a whole body of scholarly literature on them. Like any ideology, you can either agree or disagree (or be ambivalent), but dismissing these ideologies as *odd* without engaging them intellectually, is, I think, a mistake. I'm not saying you have to agree (or even disagree), but I think one of the problems that a lot of pro-bitcoin people have with people who object on ideological grounds is that they tend to not really be well-versed in the ideology they are attacking. Imagine if you met someone who was vehemently anti-democracy who couldn't even coherently articulate the basic philosophy underpinning democracy of the structures of a typical democratic government. I'm pretty sure it would be a very frustrating experience! I think many of the more ideologically-driven members of the bitcoin community feel the same way.
As far as your last question is concerned: personally I am pro-bitcoin because I believe that, on a fundamental level, people have the right to voluntarily exchange goods and services without the interference of a centralized authority and bitcoin facilitates this. Not only do I believe that the free exchange of goods and services is a human right, I think that it will allow people to be more productive and create more wealth for everyone. I know it's popular to demonize free market advocates as greedy or uncaring, but personally I am in favor of free markets because I think it will enable everyone to be better off (including the poorest among us).
Anyway, thanks again for your thoughtful reply. 10,000 bits @_date: 2014-06-02 06:40:50

I can see it now: 
Washington (5/6/2018) - The White House announced yesterday a mandatory seizure of all private keys for bitcoin addresses with a balance over 5 BTC in exchange for compensation at a government-mandated fixed  rate of 57,000 USD per bitcoin, citing "national security concerns" as the federal government remains effectively insolvent for the 5th month in a row. As of this afternoon, the Winkdex BTC price continued to climb to 342,546 USD per BTC and the index held fast to new highs despite the threat of government seizure, which analysts have discounted as "effectively and physically impossible."   
At the same time, Senator Diane Feinstein (D) has introduced the 2018 FAIRNESS AND SECURITY Act into the senate, calling for massive government purchases of bitcoin in order to, as the senator put it "fund our entitlement obligations to hard working Americans." The bill has been lauded by Senator Feinstein's elderly and unemployed constituents who are struggling to live on a 700 USD (~2 mBTC) per month social security disbursement.

The state can print as much as it wants provided that the resulting inflation in daily necessities and other consumer crap is under the threshold where people start rebelling. 


No one is making this claim and you're right that states will still have other means to distort the economy to its will, but control over currency is a hugely important tool in the state's toolbox that, once lost, cannot be fully replaced by other means. It is far more expensive and difficult to actively confiscate wealth (taxation) than it is to confiscate by inflation. 
This is doubly true if / when bitcoin becomes a common currency. Not only will bitcoin neuter the state's ability to issue currency, it will also make taxation practically much more difficult. Right now, if they want, the IRS can freeze your bank account with pretty much no due process. They cannot do the same thing to your bitcoin. Right now, it is easy for the government to keep an eye on large currency transfers since they have complete access to banks' records. It is not possible to perform such monitoring with bitcoin.
I could go on and on. Bitcoin is not "just another currency." It is a statist nightmare and will severely hamstring the state's power relative to where we are now.            
@_date: 2014-05-29 08:18:59
Bitcoin isn't even close to mainstream. How many people have actually ever acquired and spent a bitcoin (or fraction thereof)? In other words, how many people in the US or around the world have ever made a transaction on the blockchain?
If any one had rigorous statistics on this, I would be interested, but I can't imagine that this number is anywhere over 1% even in markets that have seen more widespread bitcoin-related innovation.
Once the percentage of people who have left their mark on the blockchain increases beyond 30% or so you might have an argument that bitcoin has finally gone "mainstream." 
@_date: 2014-12-20 07:27:08


You're probably getting sick of me contradicting you so much, but this statement is also difficult to support. Hear me out.
When you create a blockchain, you need a robust network of computers (computing power) to maintain it, otherwise it can be broken with a sufficiently powerful supercomputer (this has actually happened to some alternative crypto-currencies). If a government wanted to set up it's own block-chain and keep it secure, they would need to ensure that the total power of all the computers maintaining the blockchain is greater than the total computing power controlled by a potential attacker. In other words, if the US government set up a blockchain specifically for voting they would have to ensure that the computing power used to maintain the new blockchain is significantly greater than the total computing power controlled by all rivals (China, Russia, Google, etc.) who might be interested in manipulating the outcome of the election. This is a serious problem, even with the resources of the most powerful government on earth.
That's not even the worst problem with a new blockchain, though. The fatal flaw of using a new blockchain maintained only (or primarily) by the government is that said blockchain could be manipulated as long as the manipulator controlled more than 50% of the network. If the "US voting blockchain" is 80% maintained by some central authority, how can we know that that authority is not manipulating the blockchain? We cannot and trustless voting is impossible without decentralization.
On the other hand, the total computing power of the bitcoin blockchain is [higher than the world's 500 most powerful supercomputers combined]( (!). Not only is the bitcoin blockchain protected by an insane amount of computing power, it is also not centralized, meaning that no one controls more than 50% of the network's computing power. This means that no single entity can tamper with a record that has been made on the ledger so things like trusless voting are possible.
Anyway, that got a little long, so let me know if you have any questions. I'm not trying to be pedantic here, I swear. I just really enjoy trying to explain bitcoin to other people just starting out because it helps me improve my own understanding of the technology.
Anyway, thanks for keeping and open mind and listening to this old bitcoin enthusiast talk! It is really nice to see people here who are interested in learning about this fascinating technology. 5000 bits @_date: 2014-06-03 08:41:50

This is a really interesting point, but does deflation necessarily preclude  the possibility of loans?
Say my friend needs 50 BTC to start a small internet business and the rate of BTC inflation is -3% (that is, prices for everything denominated in BTC go down 3% every year). I loan my friend the 50 BTC at an interest rate of 5%, but since the rate of inflation is -3%, the effective interest rate is now 8%. How is this any different from how loans work now? Hell, credit card interest rates can go north of 20%, so an effective interest rate of 8% seems pretty decent to me.
I know this is just a counter-example and not a proof, but it seems pretty compelling to me that loans would still function in a deflationary environment.


I guess you're right in that in the future stashing bitcoin in cold storage would be more attractive than putting hundred dollar bills under the mattress is now, but would everyone just sit on their bitcoin if there were solid investment opportunities elsewhere? If we stick with an inflation rate of -3%, why settle for a measly 3% return on your coin when you could average 10% by investing in a diversified bitcoin securities portfolio?

So if I understand you correctly, basically what you're saying is that formally defined deflation is when the first derivative of the price vs. time curve is negative (prices go down), whereas disinflation is when the second derivative of the price vs. time curve is negative (the rate of inflation goes down)?
In that case, wouldn't bitcoin still be deflationary based on the historical bitcoin price data? In 2010 a pizza was 10,000 BTC whereas now the same pizza can be bought for 20 mBTC. That sure seems like massive deflation to me. Are you saying that bitcoin is disinflationary simply because the rate of new bitcoin creation is halved every four years?

Sure, I'll respond to this idiocy.
1. Deflation is only death in the current debt-based fiat regime because it means the US government cannot effectively roll over its ballooning debt and kick the can down the road for another year. Deflation being dangerous is a massive bug in the current system, but far from a law of nature. 
2. Your claim that humanity never had a healthy economy before the advent of central banking and centrally planned inflation is laughable. Open a goddamn history book.
3. Also, the OP is correct that central banks are able to buy assets with nothing more than digits that they literally typed into a computer. Imagine your custodian (the government) sold promises that you would give up your labor (debt) to your neighbor because they typed a few zeros into an excel spreadsheet. Would that be cool? Of course not. Your labor and the labor of your kids and grandchildren is being sold for digits typed into a computer by a committee of PhDs who have zero scientific or rational basis for what they do other than "the system needs to be maintained."

This kind of behavior needs to be more widespread in this community.

Even people who are very technologically proficient won't necessarily "get" bitcoin until they see it in action in a real world application. I have a good friend in IT who I have been talking to about bitcoin for several months on and off. I had always thought, "if there's anyone in my circle of real world friends who would understand the significance of bitcoin, it's this guy." Despite his high level of technological proficiency and general intelligence, he remained extremely skeptical and sometimes even antagonistic towards bitcoin as a viable concept. Until...
A week ago, I was helping this guy with a project and my friend noticed a website we were using as a reference accepted bitcoin donations. He joked that I should "donate some bitcoins," probably thinking that it would be a huge pain in the ass to perform the transfer and I wouldn't take him on his offer. He definitely didn't expect me to say "sure" whip out my phone, scan the site's QR code, and have 5 USD worth of bitcoin donated within 15 seconds. When this happened and I showed him how the donation was already listed on blockchain.info, the look on his face and his reaction was absolutely priceless: "holy shit, this is going to change the world."

@_date: 2014-12-09 12:03:26
Kudos for making this list, but many of the issues you highlight are quite solvable or have been previously addressed


It is not even clear if this will become a problem, even with millions of transactions per hour. Moore's Law has kept the size of the blockchain manageable since bitcoin's inception and assuming bitcoin is allowed to grow gradually and organically I think this will continue to be the case. If not, there are several proposals for intelligently pruning the blockchain that can be used to ameliorate this issue.


This is pretty much a non-issue. Most retail POS systems work fine with 0 confirmations. (Don't have a source for this other than my own experience using bitcoin in the wild, so maybe someone else can back me up on this)


With Tor and coin mixers you can stay pretty much 100% anonymous. (Source: The existence of a thriving black market on the darknet) Darkwallet will make bitcoin anonymity even easier and more robust.


Well which do you want? More anonymity or less? I don't think anyone except busybodies and overbearing governments really care about something being *too* anonymous.


This is purely an implementation and market issue rather than an issue with bitcoin itself. If there is demand for bitcoin consumer protection services that insure your bitcoin against bad products and services, there is nothing stopping someone from starting such as service.


I'm not well versed enough in cryptography to really address this, but this is the first I've heard of a potential issue with secp256k1. Perhaps someone else can address this.


Deflationary currencies have been used throughout history and human progress has proceeded perfectly fine under deflationary regimes. The "deflation = bad" meme is propagated very aggressively by certain economists because the current debt-based system would literally collapse if deflation took hold. Deflation being bad is a flaw of our fragile, centrally controlled monetary system, but it is not a law of nature.
Friendly disclaimer: I'm not trying to argue that you're wrong, just thought I'd share a few counterpoints to the issues you brought up. Personally I think discussing the potential flaws in bitcoin is one of the best things we can do as a community. Actually, I think the biggest threat to bitcoin is not a fatal flaw per se, but the possibility that someone, whether an individual or government, might come up with something better, though this concern is tempered by (a) the network effect advantage of bitcoin and (b) the fact that the last six years or so strongly point to the fact that governments don't really have their shit together and are likely incapable of solving some of the deeper economic issues the bitcoin solves.

Fair enough. But it is sobering to go back and read legislation from the days of the "American Republic" and discover that it is actually of a reasonable length and readable by a normal human being. Many bills which are enacted into law today are more than a thousand pages long and unreadable even by even a seasoned legal professional. Hell, the ACA was so long and dense and passed in such haste that there is no way that our so-called "representatives" who voted for it actually read it and understood it's content. If this is not a ludicrous perversion of the democratic process I don't know what is.

Seconding this, but the progression of the "awakening" should be a thematic element of the show that builds in significance over time and ultimately moves toward the forefront as the show nears its end / climax. 
For instance, you could deploy an awakening metaphor in subtle ways (verbal or visual references to "getting-up," alarm clocks, etc.) that don't immediately register with the average viewer and gradually build up to include the theme in more integral / concrete elements of the show (people stuck unaware in the fiat / corporate legacy system as zombies, etc.).

I would go even farther and say that money is a medium for collective ad-hoc intelligence.
As "far out" as this sounds, hear me out: money has enabled us, as a species, to organize according to modes that are so unbelievably complex as to be beyond the understanding of any single individual participating in said monetary system. Nevertheless, the allocation of resources (natural resources, capital, labor, etc.) that is produced by this system is not random but highly organized. In essence, money allows for intelligence to manifest as an emergent property of voluntary exchange between individuals who do not possess the same form of intelligence manifested by the system itself. This is analogous to the fact that you and I all exhibit intelligence as an emergent property of the way in which the neurons and glial cells in our brains interact with one another, despite the fact that the neurons and glial cells themselves do not possess the intelligence of the whole brain.

Full Quick and Dirty Translation (cause it's a slow work day):
CEO Mikitani Forecasts "Rakuten to Implement Bitcoin" - Mainichi Shimbun  July 15, 2014  Tokyo Morning Edition
In a speech given in Fukuoka City on the 14th [yesterday] the CEO of Rakuten, Hiroshi Mikitani, said, among other things that "the internet revolution is accelerating this year and I imagine that, sooner or later, Rakuten will start accepting money in the form of bitcoin (an internet virtual currency)."
The speech was directed at merchants who operate on the internet-based virtual "Rakuten Marketplace." CEO Mikitani indicated as his reason for forecasting the implementation of bitcoin that "it is increasingly the case that countries with unstable economies are able to achieve greater security [with bitcoin] versus their own currencies."
Furthermore, with regard to the potential of the internet, Mikitani said that, "all forms of transacting will come into play, not just watching, reading, and buying. What functions existing things perform will be redefined and new services will emerge rapidly." As an example, he discussed the possibility of services which allow you to lend out your own room to people in lieu of a hotel room using Facebook as an informational basis of trust. [Kazuhiro Toyama]
As others have pointed out, if Mikitani is serious about this, this is incredible news for bitcoin in Japan. So far adoption and public awareness here in Japan has been lagging and Mikitani is well-known in Japan as somewhat of a maverick in Japanese internet commerce (similar to Jeff Bezos in the U.S.).

Again, there is a large body of scholarly literature that discusses these issues from a free-market perspective and you might be surprised how well thought out some of their arguments are. A good place to learn about the an-cap position on the market failure problem as it relates to externalities is [this Wikipedia entry and the sources cited within](
The notion that markets fail when there are some irrational actors is pretty controversial, particularly since the market tends to dis-favor these actors.
As far as information asymmetry is concerned. I agree that in the past information was valuable and hard to come by, but with the marginal cost of information now approaching zero, the "information asymmetry" argument is more and more difficult to support. The reputation systems in place on the darknet markets demonstrate that, provided there is little marginal cost to do so, people will demand certain information (reputation information) and they will use it to their advantage to ensure that they are not scammed or cheated. This system is highly efficient and does not require a centralized authority to tell people who they can and cannot transact with.
While I agree that perhaps the world at large is not totally prepared for a libertarian revolution, I think that there will be a gradual transition away from the state as it becomes less useful in general. This is already happening with the increasing availability of information allowing people to make smarter individual decisions, eliminating the need for regulators to tell people what they can and cannot consume. Hell, the entire drug war is basically a case study of how people completely disregard regulations when regulations fail to reflect reality and it is a great example of how regulatory institutions can fail spectacularly at great cost to human health and happiness. The current financial system is, arguably, an even greater example of this same kind of regulatory failure. All in all, I think that as the marginal cost of information and education continues to go to zero, there will be less demand for the state to "protect people from themselves" and more demand for the freedom to make personal decisions, whether they are good or bad. 
Ultimately I think the libertarian position pretty much boils down to "a system with a centralized monopolistic authority will usually produce inferior outcomes versus a market of individuals engaged in voluntary interactions because the world is fantastically complicated and the market (which is just another way of saying millions or billions of individuals) is much better at processing the "data" of reality and adapting itself to said data to produce greater wealth." This is not just a philosophical position, but a conceptual one that is supported by insights from systems theory. Whatever their character, decentralized autonomous systems tend to be less fragile, more robust and (ultimately, but not necessarily at all time points) more efficient than top-down command hierarchies.
Anyway, sorry about the wall of text. Just wanted to give some perspective on how us crazy ancaps think! I promise that we're less crazy and more thoughtful than you might think, though you're certainly free to think we're wrong. ;)

Is this a serious question? If it is, I think you might have an issue comprehending the fundamental incentive structure of bitcoin. A forced hard fork without overwhelming consensus would be catastrophic. If you had a deeper understanding of the incentives and forces that govern the bitcoin ecosystem you would understand that it doesn't matter that the reward halving time is somewhat arbitrary as long as it is *consistent*. An inconsistent reward schedule completely defeats the point of bitcoin as a superior form of money. You need to do more reading of the bitcoin and economic literature before coming to premature conclusions. I'm not trying to be an ass when I say this, but almost every incorrect assumption that you have presented here could be easily avoided by referring to existing discourse by people who are far smarter and more involved in bitcoin than you or I.

Serious question: is there any scholarly literature that discusses this whole auction scenario in a more generalized context, preferably with historical examples?
It seems there are two conflicting arguments regarding whether the auction price should be higher or lower than market. On the one hand the buyer is purchasing a large quantity of the asset at once and should receive a "bulk discount." On the other hand, even if the buyer pays slightly more than market at the auction, he or she is likely still paying much less than they would had they placed a buy order on the open market, which supports the thesis that a slightly higher than market price should be expected.
Then again, perhaps there are lots of different forces at play here and the problem is hard to generalize. Thoughts?

I understand what you're saying and agree that in the short term extreme deflation is a serious bummer for the economy.
The real question here though, is in the real world how long can -10% inflation be sustained in an economy with a fixed monetary supply? If everything else is equal, 10% deflation implies a 10% increase in the number of goods and services available in the economy (again, assuming a fixed amount of currency), in other words, economic growth. If, on the other hand, the number of goods and services goes down while the monetary supply remains fixed, would we not see natural inflation since each bitcoin is now able to buy less stuff? When this happens, wouldn't bitcoin holders naturally start investing again?
Maybe the above reasoning is garbage, but if that's the case, I'd like to know why.

What? So it's cool then if my parents sign a loan in my name while I'm too young to even consent just because they are my "guardians"? Of course not. This argument doesn't even stand up to basic scrutiny. Even if you accept that parents have the right to give consent on behalf of their children, as in the context of a clinical trial, etc. you cannot reasonably say that just because A has a child, A implicitly agrees to enter his or her child into a "social contract" because that would imply that there is an alternative. Which, as we all know, there isn't (or maybe I just didn't see the "opt out of the social contract on behalf of your child" form). Again, there is no contract or agreement without real consent. 


Right, so if I want to nullify an agreement that I didn't even consent to, the onus is on me to pay a $2,350 renunciation fee and leave my place of residence. By the way, the fee was raised this year from $450. I must have missed that clause of the social contract, too, I guess.


Yeah, you can choose whether or not you want to walk into a restaurant. Of course a contract with a restaurant doesn't necessarily have to be written, but there must be consent by all parties. This is really not that complicated.

If, like many here, you think that the bitcoin economy will continue to grow, buy only as much bitcoin as you are comfortable with 100% losing, put it in cold storage, and forget about it. I promise you if you do this you will have far more peace of mind than the majority of speculators.

This is a terrible analysis. Your math is fine, but your assumptions regarding the inputs are very far off base. First of all, estimated average daily transaction volume is closer to 30 million USD per day (source: blockchain.info), but this does not even account for off-chain transactions etc. and furthermore does not account for peak transaction volume.  Furthermore, the supply of available bitcoin in circulation (i.e. bitcoin not being saved) is far less than 13 million. This number is far more difficult to estimate, but based on current exchange volume, the number of bitcoins is likely to be lower than 13 million by one or more orders of magnitude, which, by your analysis, puts the "fundamental" value of bitcoin in the hundreds of USD. 
Of course, like many technology stocks, the valuation of bitcoin is also dependent on other factors such as expectations of future network demand as well as pure speculation. The argument that bitcoin somehow has no or little intrinsic value has been done to death and is false. Yes, bitcoin is not a company in the traditional sense, but to claim the transaction network (and all sorts of Blockchain 2.0 tech coming soon) itself has little to no value is extremely foolish.   
Please come back when you have a reasonable and rigorous analysis to present. I would also suggest doing more reading on bitcoin and market economics in general before coming here with garbage analysis like the above. It ain't gonna fly here.

Here is my understanding of why it is at least tangentially related:
Congress essentially left taxpayers on the hook for trillions of dollars of potential bank liabilities with the passage of the new cromnibus bill. In a sane and functional democracy, congress would not even think of making such a law because the people would be screaming for blood, and rightly so, at such an abominably unfair law. However, congress and the government has figured out that as long as they provide a certain amount of free shit to certain people and institutions, creating dependency on the government itself, the beneficiaries of this wealth redistribution will be much less likely to object to destructive government diktat that runs counter to the interests of the nation because they cannot think beyond the government largess of which they are the beneficiary.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this sounds ludicrous. The whole point of having a blockchain (made of verified blocks) is because you have multiple entities that mine and verify the chain. Having a blockchain with just one verifier would be like using the worlds most powerful supercomputer to play pong. With only one entity verifying the chain, you might as well just have a traditional ledger instead.

Completely irrelevant to the issue of market cap. You argued that the bitcoin market cap is not equivalent to a particular equity's market cap because as soon as people start selling coins, the market cap will go down. I am merely pointing out that this is also true of stocks as well. The valuations of some stocks, like bitcoin, are also driven in part by speculation regarding their future "underlying value" (see TSLA, AMZN before they were profitable, etc.), but this does not mean that their market cap is somehow less valid.
Just to drive my point home so you can hopefully understand it this time, you say


This part in bold is total nonsense. Whether or not the price of a stock crashes is determined by depth on the buy side (bid depth) relative to how many shares are being sold at a given time. If Elon Musk sold his entire stake in TSLA (which is a stock, by the way) over a short period of time, the price most definitely would crash, though it is difficult to say to what extent... which brings me to my next question for you: on what basis do you make the following statement?


I am curious where you got this number, assuming you did not just pull it out of your ass.

Immediate loss of any credibility right here. The Fed will not raise rates this year, next year, or ever really. Why? Because they cannot - raising interest rates would result in financial catastrophe as many of the zombie entities that have been created in the current regime of cheap (a.k.a. bad) credit would no longer be able to roll over their debts, in turn causing a de-leveraging of epic proportions such that the entire system would be pretty much wiped out.
They know this, and so they will maintain a zero interest rate policy as long as they wish to remain masters of the money supply, providing injections of QE when needed to bailout isolated entities that threaten "the system." QE4 is coming soon. Count on it.

@_date: 2014-12-20 06:38:41
I agree, but the situation is somewhat nuanced. If you're interested, here's a post that I made a while ago on this subject:
I have a pet theory about bitcoin trolls, which I'm sure they won't like:
*Dons armchair anthropologist cap*
I think that a sizable number of trolls may have once held bitcoin or seriously considered holding bitcoin at some point. In short, the typical troll (or at least one archetype thereof) was at some point psychologically invested in bitcoin in a way that is probably similar to the typical bitcoin-positive person.
However, unlike most bitcoin-positive people, these trolls at some point become disillusioned with bitcoin due to some event or frustration. One example of such an event might be selling all one's bitcoin in frustration as a result of a price decline, hence explaining why we tend to see more bitcoin trolls during long drawn out bear markets. Another example might be a catastrophic loss of one's bitcoin savings due to a failure to hold private keys or store them properly (this includes people who got Goxed, etc.). In any case, the resulting "disillusionment" with bitcoin causes the proto-bitcoin troll to change his or her entire attitude toward bitcoin as a psychological defense mechanism that reconciles the trauma of whatever event caused a loss in the drive to support bitcoin. Just as the harshest, bitterest critics of a company, organization or ideology tend to be people who were once positively invested in said company, organization or ideology, so too are the bitterest critics of bitcoin often formerly positively invested in the idea of bitcoin.
In addition to the above, I also think there is a substantial population of trolls who have never been psychologically invested in bitcoin in a positive way, but who dislike bitcoin on ideological grounds. These trolls typically do not understand bitcoin at a fundamental level, but they see certain ideological language in which conflicts with their own views. The best example I can think of is the anti-libertarian, pro-state or pro-status quo crowd who like to use name-calling ("Ron Paul fun bux," etc.) in the same way that rabid fans of Rush Limbaugh like to resort to immature name calling to belittle people who espouse different views.
Finally, there are some people who just enjoy trolling for the sake of trolling. For them, it is a form of recreation. This last class of trolls is not unique to the bitcoin community, of course, but the above two archetypes definitely are and I think they go a long way in accounting for the unusually high number of trolls we see here.

@_date: 2014-05-30 03:52:11


What people, exactly? My impression has always been that "inflation is good" is just conventional economic wisdom propagated by (for lack of a better word) "establishment" economists. The people who are now claiming that deflation might be good don't appear to intersect heavily with this population subset, but maybe I'm wrong.


Technically you're right in that new bitcoins are still being issued as a reward for maintaining the blockchain, but the endgame is a fixed amount of bitcoin on the blockchain and I think there's still a good argument to be made that relative to the USD, bitcoin is already deflationary or at least less inflationary as the increase in XBT/USD shows.

This vignette reminded me of a distant but vivid memory from the 6th grade:
We, a class of about 15 students, were all assigned to fill out a worksheet of around 15 or so questions on American History using the new-fangled internet-connected desktops that had just been installed in the classroom. The teacher basically gave us a crash source in how to open Netscape Navigator and gave us a list of the dominant search engines at the time (Ask Jeeves, Yahoo, DogPile, etc.)  
I remember that I had just read something in PC Magazine (which was still the shit back in the bad old dialup days before tech blogs and such) about this awesome new "still in beta" search engine called "Google," so naturally the first thing I did when I got my hands on a mouse and keyboard was go straight to  to see what the big deal was. This being middle school, some busybody girl immediately started commenting to the teacher about how I was visiting "some weird site" that was not on the list of suggested search engines. 
It's really hard to explain just how awesome and revolutionary Google's PageRank was back in the day. I quickly discovered that by using Google, I was able to find the answers to my worksheet questions much faster than the other students using DogPile, etc. I was on my way to finishing what was supposed to be a 50 minute assignment in around 10 minutes, all thanks to the power of the Google.
Guess what happened next? The teacher actually interrupted me right before I was about to finish my worksheet and told me that I shouldn't be using "unapproved" sites despite the fact that I showed her - literally showed her using the computer screen - how fast and awesome Google was. Her response was something like "Google is not as reputable as the search sites I gave you guys" and she just walked away as the other students continued to agonize over how to phrase questions so that they actually found something relevant using AskJeeves.
At the time I thought nothing of it other than being slightly frustrated at the teacher's lack of understanding, but in retrospect it is amazing how many people, including fully grown adults, are just not willing to operate outside of their very limited cognitive space. The above is nothing but an anecdote, of course, but I sometimes wonder if that teacher still remembers brushing off a student who tried to introduce her to Google back in the late 90s before it took off.
Whatever the case may be, I choose Google back then and I choose Bitcoin now. I say to hell with the naysayers. Let them continue to use AskJeeves until the awesomeness of Google is shoved down their collective throats.

It amazes me how many people fail to grasp what is depicted in this simple graphic.
Occupy Wallstreet, the Tea Party, the Rally to Restore Sanity, etc. were full of people who desperately wanted to change the current broken system but failed, because there is nothing you can do to topple a corrupt monopoly on violence short of withdrawing all support for said system, including the parasitic politicians who selfishly maintain the entire charade against all common decency and a fundamental respect for the truth.
Marching? Peaceful protesting? Petitions? Complete waste of time. If you are still voting and paying taxes then you are perpetuating the system and the oligarchs couldn't give less of a shit. That is the bottom line. Reagan's Secretary of State, Alexander Haig once famously remarked in response to traditional non-violent protests ["Let them march all they want, as long as they continue to pay their taxes."](
That leaves the conscientious individual with one option short of open, violent rebellion: complete withdrawal from the corrupt system itself. Bitcoin enables the individual to participate in an alternative system based on non-violence and mutual consent.
Right now it is still difficult for the average person enmeshed in the system to fully withdraw via bitcoin due to the relative size of the bitcoin economy, but that's okay. Any level of withdrawal, however incomplete, is a blow against the status quo and as the bitcoin economy continues to expand it will become increasingly easy for individuals to completely withdraw from the prevailing illegitimate system.

In all likelihood no one will read this, but this is a fun discussion so I'm going to respond anyway. 


What would a doctor do if there was no rigorous scientific evidence that a particular treatment worked? Let's say I am a psychiatrist with a depressed patient. Can I ethically prescribe a drug which is empirically untested but theoretically potentially effective in curing the patient's depression? Hell no. That would be a huge breach of medical ethics in all but the most extreme circumstances. If the patient's depression did not pose an immediate threat to his or her life the prudent course of action, in the absence of any clinically proven treatment, is to do nothing pharmaceutically.
It is hilarious to me how we humans hold our physicians to the highest standards of scientific rigor, yet we allow economists to interfere with our livelihoods and our entire social system without requiring anything close to the standards of scientific rigor upheld in medicine, genomics, math, etc.
While I do think economics has a right to exist as an academic discipline, I think that it should be treated in the same way as sociology and linguistics: interesting as a field of study, but in no way regarded as scientifically authoritative in the same sense that physics, chemistry, etc. are. Can you imagine the waste of time and energy the would result if suddenly policymakers attempted to use linguistics or any other quasi-scientific discipline to coercively alter people's behavior? They would rightly be regarded by professional linguists as idiots.
Not so with economists, however. While I'm sure you're a nice enough guy (or girl), there is a certain segment of the economics profession which has the hubris to think that they have sufficient insight to "cure" certain macro-economic problems in our society and they are given extraordinary power to coercively alter the course of history itself. It is the abuse of perceived authority by economists that gives your field a bad name.
This is already too long, so I'll wrap up here by saying that I really don't think it matters whether or not some people might be psychologically biased to reject falling wages in a deflationary environment. The point I'm trying to make is that, given the room for disagreement on this issue, why on earth are we as a society making critical decisions based on what amounts to an easily questioned professional dogma?

The current system is insane. There is no other word for it.
Bitcoin will be deflationary when it needs to be and inflationary when it needs to be, as determined by market forces. Though no one can predict exactly how bitcoin will develop, one thing is sure: the current system built on debt and endless inflation is folly and will fail.

Once more well-off Chinese start using bitcoin for international commerce bitcoin will have the same "cachet" that the iPhone had in 2008 and will likely enter the daily Chinese lexicon alongside other "swanky" brands like Apple, Mercedes, LV, etc.

Just for the record, I want to say thank you for being so tenacious in this mini-debate (even though I doubt anyone is reading anything we write here). I really appreciate it when someone else just wants to get to the truth of some matter by engaging in some good old back and forth on the Internets. You have my respect, stranger. 10000 bits That said, I still think you're wrong on a couple of points:


I am curious why you are trying to distinguish between "e-payments" and "transaction volume" as I am not convinced that the distinction is really meaningful at all. Even if a transaction on the blockchain does not entail an "exchange of goods or services" *per se*, it still demands a certain level of utility from the network and requires that the network market cap be at a certain level. For instance, even if I am just transmitting 5 million USD in bitcoin to myself, the market cap of the network still has to exceed 5 million USD for this to be even possible. Given this, it seems sort of arbitrary to try and isolate a certain kinds of transactions over the network as the best transaction metric, which is why I prefer using the blockchain.info figure of 30 million USD per day.


I agree in principle with what you're saying but I think that analyzing bitcoin as though it were a payment network in isolation is a flawed approach since bitcoin is not simply a payment system that exists in a vacuum. By the very design of bitcoin, as long as there is a viable payment network it will be possible for people to speculate on network growth by buying and holding coins, thus, there is no plausible scenario in which the number of bitcoins held is zero. You could argue that the current proportion of coins held in savings today is abnormally large, but I prefer to take the data at face value and assume that there will always be a significant number of hoarded coins, since that is what we have observed throughout bitcoin's (admittedly short) history.


How dare you blaspheme against our Lord and Savior Satoshi in this sacred space! ;) In all honesty though, I admit that I am definitely biased in favor of bitcoin when these sorts of debates come up because I think that not only is it is a revolutionary technology the likes of which history has never seen, I also detest the banking cartel which bitcoin has the potential to disrupt. Is there a part of me that wants bitcoin to succeed? Hell yes. Hopefully the fact that I'm still here talking to you, though, proves that I'm not a completely mindless zealot. I love bitcoin, but I love the truth even more, even when it hurts.

Millennials should adopt bitcoin because they are getting reamed by a corrupt gerontocracy that is hopelessly dependent on a constant fiat infusion which is in turn slowly destroying the economy and what is left of our civil society.
People are starting to realize that the old system is a sham. It is high time to start over with something more transparent and less corruptible and the millenial generation could be instrumental in this respect as they are staggeringly under-served by the existing fiat system.

I know I'm going to get downvoted for asking this because some people will be offended (and the trolls will have a field day), but maybe it's a question that deserves to be asked so fuck it: what if the essence of bitcoin is actually hopelessly beyond the comprehension of 99% of the general population due to high intelligence / education thresholds required to appreciate it to the point where one has an "ah-ha" moment of real understanding?
I guess the question could be rephrased as: "is the current inability of a substantial proportion of the population to comprehend bitcoin a function of intelligence, education or some other variable (ability to think outside established frameworks, etc.)?"
If the conclusion that follows from the answers to the above two questions is "98% of the population will never be able to comprehend bitcoin on a meaningful level" (by "comprehension at a meaningful level" I mean comprehension to the point that the person in question can provide a coherent real-time synopsis of the whitepaper, though not necessarily all the details), then how will adoption and growth of the bitcoin economy be affected?

Just because someone says something, especially in an advertisement, does not mean that you can turn your brain and reasoning ability off and hope everything will be okay, trusting fully in some third party. This is the type of thinking that leads to intellectual and spiritual self-enslavement.
Google provides a platform for advertisers and customers to come together. They are basically analogous to a company that owns a bunch of highway billboards and rents out ad space to different companies. Google cannot, nor should they, be responsible for policing every single advertisement that goes over their network, as long as they don't maliciously and knowingly provide space to scammers.
Going back to the billboard example. If a company selling bullshit magnetic balance bracelets advertises on a highway billboard, should everyone who buys a bracelet then sue the billboard company due to the fact that the bracelets are pseudo-scientific garbage and don't work as advertised? Of course not, you go after the scammers themselves first and, more importantly, you need to educate and empower people to have the critical thinking skills needed to reject pseudo-science to begin with. Any other solution basically shifts responsibility where it doesn't belong, hurting everyone in a fundamentally unjust way.
We as a society really need to take a step back and re-evaluate to what extent we are willing to surrender personal freedom and responsibility in the name of X (where X is safety, fairness, etc.). If there's anything the last decade or two should have taught us, it's that sacrificing your own agency as an individual to some central authority is almost always a bad deal unless the transfer of said agency is voluntary and well-informed. Information and education, not centralized control and coercion, will set us free. 
The sad reality is the OP gave their information voluntarily and without coercion to a malicious third party and there's really not much we as a society can or should do about it. Did the third party attempt to present itself as something it isn't? Yes, and they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law for that. By the same token, the OP should have checked the blockchain.info URL (or just entered it directly instead of going through Google). There is plenty of blame to go around in a situation like this, but blaming a neutral platform for the behavior of the two main parties involved is definitely the wrong response.

Here's something you have to understand about the Chinese bureaucracy: it is massive and stupid, just like any other highly centralized entity. The reality is that the people in China who want to circumvent the government do so on a regular basis. Capital controls in China are a good example. Technically every Chinese citizen is not allowed to move more than 50k USD in capital outside of China in a given year. But wealthy people just funnel their money through Hong Kong or Macau using various schemes and loopholes.  
Centralization is a bit like genetic inbreeding: you may gain certain efficiencies in smaller applications, but once you scale it up you unleash pathological forces that overwhelm everything else. Decentralized solutions like bitcoin and voluntary markets are the exact opposite: they become smarter and more efficient as they scale. That is why they will always win.

As long as there is internet access in China there will be holders of bitcoin. The more the government tries to put the screws to bitcoin, the more people will view it as "forbidden fruit" and crave it.
Can you imagine how eager even the Chinese middle class will be to use bitcoin once they find out that they can shop while overseas on vacation at a 5 - 10% discount versus exchanging manipulated fiat for more manipulated fiat? I give it 6 - 12 months before most upscale luxury stores in Europe catering to mainland Chinese accept bitcoin.

The USG is out of control, but it is still subject to certain limits.

Exactly. The marginal cost of information storage and transmission is fast approaching zero while the cost of maintaining trust within the legacy financial system is non-trivial and will likely never go down.
The fact that using bitcoin requires only the ability to transmit and receive information without any trust requirement means that the cost of providing financial infrastructure will plummet. I agree with Andreas when he says that a lot of people underestimate the impact of bitcoin enabling billions of people to finally join the global economy on equal terms with the citizens of the developed world. The amount of human potential currently wasted due to trust barriers is staggering and bitcoin will do to finance what the internet is currently doing to knowledge and information: push the marginal cost to zero.

Even though the rule of law has been consistently shat upon by the U.S. government for the last 15 years, they would still need to ban bitcoin within the current existing legal framework. The U.S., for all of its issues, is still not China and the government cannot "ban" bitcoin "just because we said so."
Just look at how the E-Gold case went down: the government couldn't even make a case for their bullshit money-laundering charges and ended up strongarming a plea deal out of E-Gold's management in exchange for dropping trumped up allegations of child pornography.
It is questionable whether the government would have succeeded had the case gone to court but even if the government might have won, they were only able to shut down E-Gold because of a single point of failure that was easily attacked using the corrupt legacy legal system.
What entity, exactly, will Eric Holder and his goons go after if they want to disrupt bitcoin? Are they going to take the blockchain to court?

I'll take that as a compliment. ;)
But in all seriousness, that's not a bad canned spiel. It's kind of superficial, though, no?
It would be interesting to try and define the various "layers" of understanding where bitcoin technology is concerned, from all the way from "Level 1: n00b" to "Level X: Antonopoulos." Its an interesting question to think about given how insanely interdisciplinary the technology is and thinking about it might be useful for pedagogical purposes. 
Here's my attempt:
* Level 1 (n00b): Digital payment system that can be used to send money to anyone instantly. (no real specialized knowledge necessary)
* Level 2: Cryptographically secure digital payment system that allows anyone to transfer and store value securely. (cryptography and basic computer science)
* Level 3: Decentralized cryptographically secure payment system that operates without any intermediary. (cryptography, computer science, bitcoin whitepaper)
* Level 4: Anti-fragile cryptographically secure distributed ledger which provides a fixed money supply. (cryptography, computer science, bitcoin whitepaper, economics, systems theory)
* Level 5: Anti-fragile cryptographically secure distributed ledger which provides a fixed money supply as well as a platform for decentralized verification of assets, ownership, identity, etc. (cryptography, computer science, bitcoin whitepaper, economics, systems theory, assorted blockchain application whitepapers)
I'm sure there are many different ways to approach this kind of classification and its horribly unscientific, but still an interesting exercise nonetheless, I think. =)

The Denmark government is preparing to get rid of cash. The central bank of Denmark also maintains the [lowest negative interest rate in the world]( in a desperate attempt to make sure that their currency is devalued to maintain parity with the also rapidly devaluing euro, punishing average Danish savers at the expense of special business and banking interests. This is not a coincidence, folks.
They are not banning cash because it is "the future." They're not even doing it to combat terrorism or money laundering. **They're doing it because they are now out of options for foisting their dysfunctional and insane monetary policy on the people of Denmark. Once the average Dane has no access to cash, they will be helpless as the bank lowers negative interest rates even further, effectively taxing their savings.**

I agree that banning bitcoin would essentially be an admission of "yeah, we're the bad guys," but the USG already engages in all sorts of repulsive behavior and you usually don't see government employees and bureaucrats abandoning ship, with the exception of a handful of whistle-blowers. 
The sad fact of the matter is that most people who maintain the apparatus of government can easily justify the appalling behavior of the state through all manner of double-think, cognitive dissonance and magical thinking. The whistle-blowers, on the other hand are always highly aware individuals who are rightly disgusted by the state's actions and the inability of their co-workers to recognize  the implications of their participation in the system.

I don't think I'm really approaching this from a "Bitcoin" perspective so much as I'm thinking aloud about what a deflationary currency in the modern wold would mean as more of a thought experiment.
As I've said before, I'm not formally trained in economics, but I don't think that people who lack formal training in economics should necessarily be prevented from thinking about economic questions. Can you imagine Carl Sagan or Stephen Hawking talking about classical mechanics with an educated layperson and just saying something like "you need to go back and read a textbook, lol." Of course not, they would start from first principles and explain, based on empirical or theoretical evidence, their understanding of how the classical universe works. That's what science is: if someone comes up with a wrong or faulty hypothesis, it should be very easy to demonstrate where they went wrong using simple, logical reasoning or the results of reproducible empirical studies.
Economics and economists seem to fail spectacularly at this. I've been told by another redditor in this thread to "go read a macroeconomics textbook," without any additional explanation. That just strikes me as an extremely lazy way of discussing anything. If you try and explain something and it goes over the other person's head, so be it - maybe the other guy really *does* need to pick up a textbook before continuing the discussion - but at least make an attempt to explain your reasoning or GTFO.  
There seems to be a lot of disagreement among economists regarding the consequences of deflation and the historical record shows that strong technologically-spurred economic growth can occur during both inflationary and deflationary periods. Did people stop issuing loans during the period of deflation that occurred in the U.S. in the late 19th century? As I said elsewhere, I *do* think banks would continue issuing credit in a deflationary environment. Even with deflation in play there are always going to be more productive assets (companies, cooperatives, etc.) than Bitcoin that investors will want to put their money in so they get both the benefits of deflation and interest.  


Also, I don't understand your reasoning here. I guess if you don't save a single satoshi of your take home pay, you don't get to benefit from deflation, but the lack of a saving culture among Americans is just that, culture. Japan has been deflationary for some time until very recently and the savings rate among the working and white collar classes there is massive compared to the U.S., so yes, even the "common man" reaps the benefits of deflation.
As far as the rich are concerned, I don't see why they wouldn't invest in businesses that are worthwhile for an even greater return on their capital. Also, as said above:


It seems like this kind of negative feedback would prevent a deflationary spiral and people hoarding their coins, correct? If the economy does not grow - i.e. the net amount of available goods and services does not increase - and the supply of bitcoin is fixed, then there should be no impetus driving deflation. Deflation should only proceed when the economy grows and the supply of bitcoin remains fixed.

This statement is just so ludicrous I don't even know where to begin. Are you really trying to claim that a Cartel Bitcoin blockchain forced on the entire community in the way you describe would actually be more profitable to mine? For this assertion to be correct, the value of new coins would have to be at least &gt; 1/2 of the value of coins on the previous blockchain. How can the miners ensure that this is the case? The answer is of course they can't and it is far more reasonable to conclude that Cartel Bitcoin would suffer a massive loss of confidence due to an uncertain monetary supply. 
The fact that bitcoin is designed to have a 100% predictable supply is not an accident. There is a large body of theoretical and empirical work that strongly suggests a predictable monetary supply is beneficial to price discovery and almost all forms of economic activity. This is one of the reasons why the world financial markets continue to be a basket case and the current economy is limping along on an IV drip of artificial liquidity: the uncertainty in the monetary supply is a massive headache for people who want to do business and allocate capital.
While I appreciate that you took a lot of time to come up with your 51% attack "script" it is full of glaring "plot holes" and thinking about it a little more carefully and critically shows that it makes about as much sense as the plot to Back to the Future.

Definitely! I think that provably fair voting will first be used by smaller organizations, but once the idea gains traction there is no reason why it wouldn't be extended to government applications.


This is... a common misconception. At a fundamental level, there is no way that a distributed ledger such as bitcoin can work without structuring incentives properly to maintain the blockchain. Ask yourself: who secures and maintains the blockchain? The answer is the miners, who are rewarded with bitcoin for processing transactions and maintaining the blockchain. There is no such thing as a secure blockchain without an accompanying unit of currency. If there was, we would have seen one by now and the inventor of said "coinless blockchain" would be made fabulously wealthy while bitcoin would plummet. 
Just think what would happen if the value of bitcoin were to go to zero tomorrow: all the miners would pack it in and there would be no distributed ledger on which to build a provably fair voting system. Bitcoin and the blockchain are not modular, they are part of the same coherent system.

Strong incentives for early adopters does not a Ponzi scheme make. Confusing bitcoin with a ponzi scheme just because it by design enriches early adopters is like confusing an innocuous chemical with a deadly isomer just because they have the same chemical formula.

Bitcoin does not fit this definition because there is no "operator, individual or organization" paying dividends to early investors based on revenue generated by newer investors. That's all you need to know.

Will never happen. Unfixing the supply would create a catastrophic loss of confidence in the currency, so miners and everyone else on the network are incentivized to maintain the cap.

If the proportion of people with any genuine understanding of the fiat system is any indication, I think bitcoin will do just fine without the average Joe knowing all the nuts and bolts of the blockchain. For most people, the relationship with bitcoin will still be mediated by some trusted agent, and that's okay. The real issue here is that the core of the financial infrastructure no longer requires trust.
I also want to clarify here that I don't think understanding how bitcoin works is that far beyond the comprehension of the average person. The gap is one primarily of education, not intelligence. I'm still waiting for the perfect "bitcoin lecture" that will distill the essentials of the current system vs. bitcoin. [This video]( does a pretty good job of explaining the problems with the former, so I think similar materials incorporating bitcoin being available would go a long way to helping solve the "Joe the plumber" problem.

Honestly, it's really hard to say. Most attempts to give bitcoin a valuation presume that bitcoin takes over a certain percentage of the current monetary supply. I actually think this is a good approach, in theory; the problem is figuring out what that percentage should actually be.
If someone had a universally convincing (by which I mean logically irrefutable) estimate for this percentage they could publish their findings and probably win a Nobel Prize when bitcoin eventually reaches the predicted percentage of the money supply. Right now, though, all anyone can do is speculate based on qualitative arguments about the nature of bitcoin and the current economy. Personally I would not be surprised with 1% in the next ten years given bitcoin's superior properties as money and the current direction of the status-quo economic system, which is by all sane measures ripe for disruption.

No one can really answer this question for you. Whether or not bitcoin is a good investment depends on your (or your loved ones) financial situation and appetite for risk.
Anyone who gives you a simple "no" or "yes" answer to this question has no clue what they are talking about. Do your homework, make sure you understand bitcoin - including the potential upside and downside - and make an investment decision based on an informed risk assessment.
P.S. People like are shill accounts (just look at the post history) and should be ignored. There are certain people who *really* don't want bitcoin to succeed for various reasons and so spread all sorts of FUD on this subreddit. Once you know how to identify them, they can be safely ignored.
TL;DR: Ignore anyone who makes wild predictions regarding the price of bitcoin, especially people who say bitcoin will *definitely* be X and Y time. They are all full of shit.
Another edit after scrolling through all of the comments in this thread: You are being attacked by tons of trolls with no logical argument ("Bitcoin is Amway, lol"). Ask yourself this: does someone who compares bitcoin to Amway with a straight face *really* understand bitcoin at a fundamental level? Of course not. Half of the trolls here only understand that bitcoin has the potential to greatly increase in value and they see people passionate about the technology talking about its potential and ignorantly proclaim "scam!" Just remember that these ignoramuses have been a nuisance in the bitcoin community since bitcoin was 0.05 USD / BTC and their tune never changes while the bitcoin ecosystem continues to evolve. They are noise and nothing else.

Why can't bitcoin be an "asset" and a "currency" simultaneously? I submit that both these facets of bitcoin are equally important parts of a cohesive whole. 
Also, the whole dogma of "people will not spend money that they expect to appreciate" is just nonsense that you can't even empirically demonstrate, but you can certainly *disprove* the same notion with a single counter-example. I suspect that like myself many people here spend their bitcoin preferentially when the option is available *despite* the fact that they fully expect the price to appreciate over the long term.

OP got massively raped, even by airport kiosk standards.
At the current exchange rate: 40000 JPY = 390.24 USD so the kiosk effectively skimmed off 390.24 - 330 = 60.24 USD which is a whopping 15.4% transaction fee.
By comparison, you can go to any 7-11 in Japan with a Visa debit card and get yen from a USD-denominated bank account at the current market exchange rate for around 3 dollars per transaction.
Even without bitcoin, the airport cash exchanges are an incredible ripoff and can't even compete with exorbitant international ATM fees.

I'll tell you why. As a society, and especially among the political class, we have become infected by a pernicious meme that has caused untold suffering for millions while enriching a few privileged insiders: the notion that some people have the right to prevent other people from peacefully and voluntarily interacting with one another, all in the name of irrelevant boogeymen like "safety," "national security," "terrorism," etc.
Until it becomes common sense that *no one* has the moral right to interfere with voluntary peaceful activity between sentient beings, we as a species will continue to endure needless suffering purely as a result of our collective ignorance, cognitive biases, and desire to exert control over other human beings.
This problem is really not that different than the issue of separation of church and state that caused a revolution in the thinking of the Western World during and after the enlightenment. Back then, it was the control freaks trying to tell people what they could and could not believe (i.e., thought-crime). Now it is the control freaks attempting to tell people that they cannot peacefully associate in certain ways. We need a new Enlightenment that firmly casts out this destructive meme from our collective culture for good.

If bitcoin begins to succeed in a way that even the apparatchiks in power cannot ignore, they will definitely start doing this. Unfortunately by that time very little will be available for sale anywhere near current prices and they will have to relinquish tons of real assets (real estate, equities, etc.) to gain a stake. I don't think anyone with a functioning brain will shed a tear for them, though. There is always a price for being too late to the party and with bitcoin it will be a dear one.

The epilogue is such epic gobbledygook it's not even funny. He effectively asserts that "an economy involving not only exchange but also production and investment" is somehow not possible or highly sub-optimal under a natural quasi-fixed money supply (e.g. gold or cigarettes) when the historical record clearly shows that this is not the case. Did people fail to produce or invest under a gold standard? Of course not.
I also love the hand-wringing about "demand not always being abundant enough to absorb the produced output." No shit, sometimes output may exceed demand, in which case the cost of goods deflates to compensate. The horror!

What a disgrace. If the Greeks are smart they will exit during their upcoming election cycle. Also, the German people are too smart to authorize Draghi to proceed with an unprecedented round of QE that would effectively siphon off their own wealth to stabilize France, Spain, et al.

No it's really not a fair point and Bitcoin is not "intellectual property." (You are confusing "intellectual property" with "intangible property," which bitcoin is.)
Anyone, and I mean anyone, who says that the value of bitcoin will go to zero is wrong and it's easy to demonstrate why: as long as there is a use for bitcoin, there will be buyers and as long as there are buyers, bitcoin will not be equal to 0 USD. You can perhaps argue with more credibility that the value will *approach* 0 USD, but - again, as long as there is a use - it will never "go to zero." I would even argue that the price floor for bitcoin is very far away from 0 USD given that it already has several very well understood use cases, including transacting on the dark net, gambling where it is otherwise illegal, routing around currency controls, etc. As an aside, these use cases are increasing rather than decreasing.
As long as there is a use for bitcoin it is a viable form of money and as long as it is a viable form of money, bitcoin, like all other forms of money, will have speculators. In a nutshell: natural demand for the currency as well as buying and selling by speculators pretty much guarantee that bitcoin will never go to zero short of something truly catastrophic like elliptic curve cryptography being broken. Even then, there are so many copies of the blockchain out there that an alternative scheme could probably be implemented with a hard fork.
TL;DR: It will take a lot more than a severe bear market to make bitcoin go to zero and 99% of the people out there who say "bitcoin to 0" have no clue what they are talking about.

While I understand why it's easy to think like this, the above reasoning does not work because it is oversimplified and does not stand up to real theoretical scrutiny. 
In a healthy growing economy there is always going to be an opportunity cost to hoarding currency which can be re-invested into the economy, even in a deflationary macro-environment. For example, let's say that the real economy is growing at a nice 5%, but inflation is -2% (i.e., deflation of 2%). As a holder of the currency, I could certainly just leave my currency alone and let it appreciate by 2% annually. This is not a terrible rate of return, but on the other hand I could have invested my currency back into the general economy and earned an effective 7% return (the rate of deflation + real growth), so I have effectively lost 5% of my return as an opportunity cost for not re-investing my currency - i.e., I have become poorer relative to my peers who chose to invest in the economy. In general, people want to earn the best possible return on their existing wealth without taking on undue risk, so the "rational investor" in this scenario will almost certainly not horde their currency.
"But," you say, "what if people are not rational and just horde currency anyway since the 2% return is risk free?" This is really not a big concern for the reasons explained above, but even if you think about what actually happens when many people start hording a currency, you see that everyone hording all of the time is just not possible. Suppose economic growth is 5% and inflation is -2% as above. Everyone holding currency decides, "I'll just horde what I have and wait for my wealth to appreciate!" What happens next? As money is taken out of the economy, initially you would see additional deflation to -3, -4 or even -5% inflation. This is what Keynesian economists refer to melodramatically as a "deflationary death spiral," but this is a misnomer since deflation cannot actually spiral out of control. Why? This "death spiral" is countered by a corresponding increase in interest rates as borrowers (companies, governments, etc.) have a harder time finding currency on the open market and thus are forced to increase the price they pay for borrowed currency. The more people hoard, the greater the above opportunity cost to not investing or loaning your currency out is. For example, let's say inflation goes from -2% to -5% as people hoard currency, while interest rates go from 5% to 10% as it becomes harder and harder to find currency on the open market. Now your opportunity cost for failing to invest is 15%!
Eventually this opportunity cost would just be too tempting for many investors and the economy would reach a natural deflation/inflation equilibrium determined by the market. Calculating this equilibrium is tricky, but you can be absolutely certain that it will be reached and people will not hoard their currency until there is none left on the open market. This theoretical perspective is also very well supported by the historical evidence: crippling long-term deflation has never been observed in a growing economy, even when the money supply is fixed or effectively fixed.
Tl;DR: The dogma of "inflation, bad!" is just that.

Going to to balance your perspective on bitcoin is like going to the Church of Scientology to balance your perspective on modern psychology: you'll get an alternate point of view, it just won't be rooted in anything approaching logic or reason.
For all the shit that the anti-bitcoin crowd slings about how is one-sided, I find that the best criticisms and questions regarding bitcoin can be found right here by people who actually understand some of the deeper technological and economic challenges that bitcoin faces. The problem is that the overwhelming majority of anti-bitcoin media clearly just doesn't understand the technology at a fundamental level. It would be great if someone started but that's not likely to happen. In the meantime is actually okay as long as you filter out the noise on both sides of the bitcoin ideological divide.

It would be interesting if there were regular surveys made among the parasite banker and economist class assessing faith in central banks.
I have a feeling with the SNB drama, multiple EU peripheral CBs dropping interest rates into negative territory, the Chinese Yuan which is pushing against the PBoC peg, etc. faith in the CBs is at an all time low.
The global economy is looking more and more like a morphine addict who is on his last vial and slowly beginning to realize that the only way forward is to give up the morphine and actually make fundamental changes to his or her lifestyle (i.e., fundamental structural changes to the economy).
Personally, I can't wait to see all this play out. One thing is for sure though: the status quo is pathologically dysfunctional and will have to be done away with one way or another. Will the apparatchiks wake up from the fantasy of central bank omnipotence and force the governments of the world to make painful but needed reforms by raising interest rates and refusing to monetize government debt, or will the morphine addict expire before the collective delusion is effectively dispelled?

No, it does not.
As far as real economic health is concerned. It doesn't matter whether the money supply is growing or shrinking as long as price discovery is not disrupted. This basically means that, however the money supply behaves, it needs to behave predictably so that investors can take current and future behavior into account when participating in the market (which is just price discovery).
One of the reasons that the US and other developed economies are floundering is that their money supplies are unpredictable, making it difficult if not impossible for market agents to make decisions with a certain level of certainty regarding the future of the money supply. This is why half of the financial news is just speculation about future central bank policy rather than substantive business issues like enterprise competitiveness, what sectors to invest in, etc.
Fiat currency might actually work if the supply was predictable (for example, if the central banks just got together and agreed on a specific 10 year plan and just put it into practice without any shenanigans). Sadly, the political temptation to meddle in the monetary supply despite the implications for the wider economy is just too great, which is why fiat always fails and why bitcoin is a superior form of money with a superior market (price discovery) at its economic core.

I agree with Tim Draper that financially under-served markets represent a great use case for bitcoin that has yet to be fully realized due to a lack of infrastructure. 
Many people in developing countries do not have access to credit cards or traditional financial services simply because the cost of providing them is too high. Bitcoin, by contrast offers extremely low transaction and storage costs while providing unrestricted access to international markets. I think in 2015 we will continue to see accelerating deployment of services like VoguePay that enable the unbanked in the developing world to start leveraging the bitcoin economy to their advantage.

Correlation does not imply causation! Of course a modern debt-based fiat economy that is contracting will initially experience deflation as banks are unable to continue to make loans as aggressively as they did during the boom times, causing the money supply to contract.

The fact of the matter is that the golden age of central banking has conditioned many U.S./UK investors (and by extension non-investors) to be very afraid of healthy volatility and other "market chaos" because people have become accustomed to an ever-rising equities market in which natural, healthy volatility has been subverted by central bank intervention.
Watching and (god forbid!) participating in the bitcoin market is more akin to the experience market participants would have had before interventionist central banking and monetary policy back when U.S. markets were truly free.

This is yet another fallacy that is repeated as dogma among certain economists, but it is not necessarily true. Theoretically speaking, if the rich just hoard their appreciating currency the economy ceases to function and the "bitcoin rich" are not longer rich. An equilibrium between hoarding and spending will necessarily result. Also, the value of bitcoin will only go up over the long term if the bitcoin economy is more productive, period. This precludes everyone just holding onto their currency like lottery tickets.


It is in fact the people with more modest incomes that will benefit most from a deflating bitcoin, since it means they have the same opportunities to grow their wealth as the 1%. Right now, if I am poor and have 25 USD I can park it in a savings account and get almost no interest while my 1% neighbor can hit up his financial adviser to invest 700,000 USD in an emerging market bond fund that makes 9% but requires a 500,000 minimum. In a post-hyperbitcoinization world. Deflation rewards a saver of 1 satoshi just as much (proportionally) as it does a saver of 10 BTC.

Do you think everyone who currently owns a share of APPL paid 100 USD for it? The market cap of bitcoin could go to 700 billion tomorrow if that's what the market was paying for it and there are many ways that might happen without 700 billion in fiat being used to buy bitcoins.

The shamelessness of it is what is truly amazing. They know that it's common knowledge that the paper gold and silver markets are manipulated by funny money printers and they just don't care about hiding it anymore. I think they really believe their own kool aid - that they are untouchable and can do no wrong. And who can blame them? They are the demigods at the top of the perverted priesthood that is our monetary system.
As an aside, I find it fascinating that the costs of storing and transporting gold contribute to the ease with which it can be manipulated by large institutions. This is tantamount to a fatal flaw in gold as a money and it is a fatal flaw that bitcoin has effectively fixed. I think that Satoshi was correct in emphasizing the "ease of transfer and storage" property of bitcoin. Who knows, maybe monetary theorists will look back 20 or 30 years from now and realize that transferability and ease of storage / security are essential properties of strong money and humans have never had a truly strong money until bitcoin.

No they shouldn't. Leaving aside the problem of whether or not most so-called "democratically elected" governments are in fact that rather than a pathetic charade put on by the ruling class (hint: they are in fact a charade), no one has the right to unilaterally determine who is and is not a boogeyman/terrorist and then deny them the right to transact in the economy without any kind of due process.


Yeah, perhaps it could be. Too bad that it's also often used to bully innocent people that the state doesn't like without any due process. Personally I think a weapon with the potential for, and long history of, such abuse is better off not existing in the hands of the state.  
With bitcoin, money is nothing more than data on the blockchain, where busybodies like you cannot touch it. Money is now free of state control whether you like it or not. =)

Agreed. My impression from reading the article was that the fed goons were able to seize the victim's private keys, which could have been prevented with simple encryption. At least then he could have kept his bitcoin under his control while being processed by the system.

Headline is misleading.
The Japanese announcement says that withdrawals and deposits to their Rakuten Bank account have been frozen due to a police action and they are currently trying to contact the police to determine the reason. They say that the situation will prevent large withdrawals of Yen, but smaller withdrawals will still go through via their accounts with other banks.
They also say that BTC withdrawals are still being processed. Also:
"Our customer's assets, either denominated in Yen or BTC, have not been lost and we promise that will will work toward a resolution of the situation as quickly as possible." 
Could be something, or it could be a trivial misunderstanding. Either way, it will be interesting to see how this develops.

I've had enough, and I daresay most of the people reading this sub have also had enough. Enough of the dishonesty, the manipulation and the paternal, holier-than-thou attitude of government organizations and their agents, which have attempted to infiltrate and derail the discussion here. 
is a classic, transparent case of someone who is either a shill or a hopelessly blue-pilled useful idiot. Given how hard he tries, his one-track topic history, and the age of his account (he will insist that the age of his account is irrelevant, but it most definitely is), I'm guessing he is the former.
Sure, he doesn't make any factual errors in his posts. Why would he? All he needs to do is point to the narrative and "evidence" provided by our corrupt masters in government and say, "look! there's a reasonable explanation for all of this and the evidence corroborates. The records were verified by a separate and completely 'independent' forensics team! You guys just don't understand how law enforcement works like I do."
To anybody paying attention to the actions of our government in recent years, his bullshit speaks for itself. If, in light of the extraordinary malfeasance, lack of good faith and pervasive corruption of the U.S. government that has been revealed at an accelerating rate over the last several years, you are still inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt, you are not a "reasonable skeptic" you are either willfully or stupidly naive. Corruption in the monstrous apparatus of the state is the rule, not the exception.
Most people here are beginning to realize this and will not accept any evidence presented by the authorities at face value, particularly that which oh-so-conveniently supports the overall government narrative.
I don't know whether or not DPR is truly guilty of attempted murder for hire, but until there is incontrovertible evidence from a non-government source, I will presume that he is innocent until proven guilty by a non-interested party.

Love it.
To contribute: since becoming involved in Bitcoin I've started to realize how irrelevant existing political structures are for the promotion of human progress, despite how we obsess over them like a bad neurosis. Political structures grow up around new technologies, not the other way around.
Following this line of thinking to it's logical conclusion, I've realized that discussing politics (though not necessarily ideology) is pretty much a massive waste of time if you want to understand at a fundamental level where we came from and where we are going. Despite history's penchant for elevating the ruling class into the pages of our textbooks and collective lore, it is technology that drives our civilization forward, from the advent of farming to the internet and now to bitcoin.
Whether or not bitcoin is revolutionary enough to fundamentally alter our political society in the same way the industrial revolution or farming did remains to be seen, but I would not bet against it.      
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:29:23
I don't know whether the recent downtrend in the price is related to a banking cartel attack - its impossible to say one way or the other in the absence of any kind of evidence, and frankly it's irrelevant on a long term horizon.
What I do know is that if the banking cartel wanted to attack bitcoin the price might be the vector of choice if for no other reason than access to arbitrarily large amounts of fiat (versus, say, arbitrarily large amounts of computing power, which the banking cartel does not have) gives one the ability to easily manipulate the price at this stage of bitcoin's development. I would be surprised if such manipulation was not being carried out at some level given the stakes of the game and the potential money to be made even at the margins.
That said, a speculative attack on bitcoin can only depress the price of bitcoin as a function of its speculative value. Even manipulators with deep pockets cannot defy the laws of supply and demand for long. Thus, if you think that bitcoin is under speculative attack, you would naturally take a long position as a bet that bitcoin's price is below the natural intersection of its overall supply and demand curves.

Disregarding for the moment how negative interest rates are themselves an abominable artifact of insane central bankers, it does make sense to invest in negative interest rate instruments if, as an investor, you think that interest rates will become even more negative in the future.
Also don't forget that for many NIRP currencies, holding large amounts of cash in a savings account is penalized with negative interest, so purchasing bonds at less of a negative interest rate might make sense if you have a shitload of digital cash in a bank account that cannot be easily and safely converted into physical paper currency. For smaller amounts, it might make more sense to just store your fiat under the mattress.
Of course, if your time horizon is long (5 - 10 years) and the money is not essential to your survival, conversion to bitcoin is not a bad strategy.

Reversibility of transactions will come to bitcoin.

Krugman is an ideological tool of the epic scam known as central banking. He is not dumb, only self-serving.
Wait... actually I take that back after reading this:


Buy them back with what? All the *USD denominated* trash the Fed currently has on its balance sheet? Gold that hasn't been properly audited in god knows how long? 
If there is a serious problem with the USD I wonder how much gold people will ask for for their rapidly depreciating dollars? Does anyone seriously think they have enough real assets to stop a hypothetical hyperinflation scenario?
Also this gem:


I'll charitably ignore that Krugman seems to erroneously use "hash function" when I assume he meant "coin creation algorithm." Even so, the reality is that *there is no ceiling on the value of bitcoin except for the total size of the economy that it supports*. What's really sad is that Krugman actually thinks that this is a problem because "muh deflation."
Between Krugman and Obama I think it's safe to say that the Nobel Prize Committee's credibility is effectively shot with the exception of the hard sciences.

Ripple did not come close. There has always been a single point of failure: Ripple Labs. People are not going to use something as a store of value with such obvious counterparty risk. If RL doesn't like what you're doing with Ripple, they can block you from the network and shut you down. Bitcoin's fundamental appeal as a form of money is that, barring a cataclysmic shutdown of the entire Internet, there is no single entity or even group of entities which can interfere with the network.
The same applies to any alternative crypto started by Apple, Microsoft and Google. An ApMiGo Coin that was deployed by these companies would inevitably be regulated out of usefulness. There would be little practical difference between holding ApMiGo Coin and USD in a bank. Things like the DNMs, OpenBazaar, Augur, gambling, donations to Snowden, etc. would not be possible. Additionally, if such a coin were tied to the USD, there would be little incentive to hold it as a store of value over the long term, particularly with the deteriorating US fiscal situation.
The people focusing on mainstream adoption of bitcoin in the immediate future are, in my opinion, mistaken. Bitcoin will go mainstream, but only after it has proven its usefulness as a "hard money" that offers protection against a dysfunctional legacy financial system and furthermore develops more unique use cases that exist entirely outside the fiat system. The DNMs, OpenBazaar, Augur, Ethereum are a few such cases.

What the fuck kind of logic is this? Using this line of reasoning, the government can charge you with an arbitrary crime and freeze all your assets "just in case" you're convicted. Do these people not understand what due process means?
Frankly, I'm surprised that the feds are allowed to restrict access to any amount of a defendant's assets before a conviction is made. If you are truly "innocent until proven guilty," then it is impossible to say "these assets were connected with a crime" when *you haven't even established that the crime was committed in the first place*.

He just doesn't understand how the whole thing works, but thinks he does, just like 99% of "experts" who have opined on bitcoin.
Edit: I think the best way of explaining the "intrinsic value" to these people is to give them a scenario where the bitcoin blockchain either has to be used (avoiding capital controls, blockchain notarization, etc.) or has a distinct advantage over existing methods (remittances, machine transactions, etc.) and then ask them how they would go about using the blockchain without using bitcoin. Just like you cannot make yellow, shiny jewlery without gold, you cannot write to the blockchain without using bitcoin. BAM, intrinsic value!
Double Edit: Personally, I think the word "intrinsic value" is itself stupid, whether with regard to fiat, gold or bitcoin. Value is always determined by market demand and is thus extrinsic by its very nature. Nothing has value by itself and everything's value is determined by the market. Discuss.

In a hyperbitcoinization scenario, it's possible that the price of certain goods will change dramatically, not only to reflect the preferences of a new wealthy class, but also to reflect the availability of bitcoin as a widely recognized store of value.
For instance, the price of fine art has skyrocketed since the financial crisis, because people with a lot of wealth view fine art as a superior store of value to other asset classes which are looking increasingly shaky as central banks struggle to prop up equity and other asset values. In a bitcoin world where real economic growth is unleashed due to the availability of a truly free money like mid to late 19th century America it is possible that the price of fine art will in relative terms not be as high as it is now as there will be more growth potential in the actual economy (equities, etc.)

They do not need to be stopped because they are incapable of stopping bitcoin in the first place. The trend over the last 5 years has been increasing convertibility from USD to BTC and vice-versa. You suggest a reversal in this trend without any specific argument to back up your claim other than citing a few instances where control has been established over certain internet business (gambling, etc.) that have traditionally operated in legal gray areas. Where is the 100 million dollar venture-capital funded Coinbase of the online gambling world that was shut down? Suggesting that regulators will be able to successfully reverse the current trend of increasing bitcoinization overestimates their power and flies in the face of the data we have for the last five years since bitcoin's inception.   


The financial system is not some monolithic entity. If certain banks or even certain countries refuse to touch bitcoin, they will be at a competitive disadvantage to institutions that do not discriminate against bitcoin. China has realized this and regulators there have since backed down on their initial tough stance against bitcoin transactions in China. No compliance is needed when relevant incentives are aligned properly.


Sorry, but this is a ridiculous caricature of the bitcoin community. There's no one "behind" bitcoin - bitcoin is an emerging economy with millions of disperate actors acting as participants.

Sort of. The analogy of the teleportation device breaks down if you extend it that far. 
The blockchain is uniquely useful like a teleportation device would be, but for different reasons. It is useful not because it can transport matter or information instantaneously (the former is still impossible and the latter is already possible with the internet), but rather because it is a permanent, incorruptible record to which any information can be written (for a price) and read (free) by anyone, but which cannot be changed by anyone, no matter how powerful. 
Imagine a constantly expanding magical notebook that anyone can easily refer to, but which can only be written to with a magical ink; when you write something, you can only fill in blank space that does not contain existing information, thus it is not possible to erase or cross out anything that has been written before. When you write to the block chain, whatever you wrote remains there... forever (well, at least as long as the blockchain is maintained). This is the fundamental innovation of the blockchain.
There are many interesting and useful tricks and applications you can implement with this "magical notebook" that you simply cannot do with any other technology. Therefore, the ink used to write to this notebook, being finite in supply, is valuable.
This is still not a perfect analogy, since it does not take into account the dynamics of how ink is produced as well as the fact that the notebook itself contains a record of how much ink everyone owns. That's why bitcoin is very difficult to explain to people who have not read and understood the whitepaper, it is a completely new invention that does not really have an perfect analogue in anything else. This is also why "bitcoin people" tend to find it very interesting or get excited about it which creates a lot of misunderstanding among people who are not familiar with it (or who think they understand it, but only understand it only at a superficial level). 
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:14:06
This is a flawed analogy. 
The correct analogy would be someone invents a teleportation machine which provides uncopyable and unforgable tokens to people who provide the machine with the energy it needs to perform its teleportation operations based on a fixed distribution over time. The teleportation machine, in addition to requiring some form of energy, also requires some amount (or fraction, if you prefer) of these tokens to teleport matter.
Does that make sense? Your analogy is flawed because it decouples coat hangers from the teleportation technology itself. Bitcoin is not incidental to the blockchain, it is an integral component.
Bitcoin is unique in that it requires a very rigorous conceptual understanding of how it works to have an informed opinion. The [original white paper published by Satoshi]( is a good place to start if you are technically inclined.

This is a great mini-analysis. Thanks.
It is interesting to think that perhaps, from a free market perspective, the greatest utility that the state ever provided was the unification of money and a system of economic exchange, but, as you correctly point out, "things have gotten out of hand" and the state's functionality in this respect has become (severely) impaired. If this is the case then the potential success of crypto-currency really is tantamount to the death of the state as we know it.

Find me a single person espousing anarcho-capitalism who actively advocates not contributing to the community or helping one's fellow man. Not forcing people at gunpoint to conform to your little system and having an integrated, mutually supportive community are not mutually exclusive. See: the entire history of charity in the Western world prior to the rise of the welfare state.   


I thought we were talking about a hypothetical world in which the state doesn't exist. Oh wait...
P.S.: Inequality will always exist. Trying to bend the whole of humanity to your will so you feel better about trying to resolve something that can never be resolved in the first place is demonstrably more evil and delusional than saying "how about everyone just leave everyone else alone, voluntarily interact, and see what happens in the absence of a violent hegemon."

I pretty much agree with what you, except for:


I'm not sure what your definition of "hasn't really" is, but I think that there have definitely been significant improvements in usability over the past couple of years that are hard to ignore.
Just look at wallet software for example: the original bitcoin core wallet was a nightmare to use compared to Electrum, Mycelium or (if you're a 1337 dude) Armory. Back in the day you had to wire money to sketchy people in foreign countries just to buy bitcoin, now we have Coinbase, et al. You can't swipe your card for bitcoin at the grocery store and walk out the door yet but just two years ago nobody had ever even heard of a bitcoin ATM - now there are hundreds around the world.
I agree that we have not crossed the chasm to mainstream adoption just yet and we might not for several years, but the trend of a rapidly improving ecosystem and overall usability is undeniable given the above, wouldn't you say?

The deflation argument is pure garbage. [See here for more details](
@_date: 2015-02-01 06:08:50
The ECB has given Greece until the 28th of Feb to negotiate a deal with the Troika or else they will withdraw all bank funding, which given the current situation would basically mean a massive default on Greek debt which could very easily precipitate a European banking crisis (since many Euro banks hold Greek debt and stand to become insolvent in the event of a default).
There would be some short term pain for Greece as it would need to abandon the Euro and essentially reset its entire financial system, but the blow to Greece could potentially be significantly softened if the BRICS (primarily Russia and China) extend credit to Greece as a self-interested "fuck you" to the EU and US. Europe, on the other hand, would be massively fucked.
Regardless of what happens, Greece is likely to come out on top. Personally I think the ECB will cave to the new Greek government's demands despite all the tough talk by Merkel and Draghi as the EU has far more to lose than Greece does as a result of a Grexit.
The EU is damned either way: if they let Greece call their bluff and exit the Euro (leaving their European bank creditors high and dry) the Euro will face an existential crisis. If on the other hand they cave to Greece's demands, Spain, Portugal, Italy, et al. will also start agitating for debt relief which would further undermine the monetary union.
TL;DR: We're going to see a lot of drama over the next month as the EU mandarins scramble to maintain their hilariously unstable monetary house of cards.

I would say the possibility is so remote as to be trivial. You would need to have two instances of the same malware on different machines communicating with one another in a way that is not detectable by the user. If the systems are air-gapped and only one is connected to the internet, this would be incredibly difficult to pull off reliably as the only way for information to be conveyed between the two systems is the unsigned and signed transaction data itself, which could be formatted in many different ways depending on the software/hardware combination used. It's also worth noting that once a countermeasure is developed for said hardware-based malware the malware will not longer work properly on the offline machine since the malware cannot update itself to deal with countermeasures.
I don't think anyone, even the NSA, would waste their time trying to develop such a complicated exploit that could be neutralized so easily. It just doesn't make a lot of sense from an investment-reward standpoint.

Now *this* is actually an interesting scenario, but I don't think its still that much of a concern. Let's assume the user checks the first and last three digits of the address before sending (which is standard good practice and not hard at all for the average user). In order to perform this kind of attack reliably you'd need to have a table of  62^6 = 56,800,235,584 precalculated unique addresses. The only way to obtain a public key is from a private key, so assembling this kind of list would essentially be equivalent to generating 56 billion unique vanity addresses. Even if we assume the attacker has a decent amount of hardware at their disposal and assume just one second to generate each address (in practice it would be much longer), it would still take 1,800 *years* to create the full list.
I might be missing something conceptually here, so feel free to comment.

Okay I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt, but it's clear you have no idea what you're talking about.
99.9% of people who hold bitcoin have no problem storing and spending it with ease and it's only getting easier for the less technically inclined. If you're too much of an idiot to do an hour of reading and set up some kind of offline storage, then you can either wait for more idiot-proofing innovations in the space or store your coins on Coinbase.
Also, the only thing that Bitcoin has in common with gold is a limited supply (and in this respect Bitcoin is actually superior because the supply is truly limited, unlike gold which is potentially unlimited assuming you have sufficient energy to mine it). Bitcoin is more easily stored, transmitted, divided and verified than gold, by several orders of magnitude. Try holding and transmitting gold through a warzone and then try the same thing with Bitcoin. The two are not even in the same league.  
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:16:44
Yeah, I started to notice this a couple of days ago when someone posted the sarcastic buttcoin tagline "Money of the Future!" in response to someone's comment about using offline storage for security reasons. The post went straight to the top with 27+ upvotes. 
I don't know if it's necessarily trolls, though, as much as it's just a function of the bi-polar sentiment of the hive mind here. When Bitcoin is on a bull run you get exactly the opposite phenomenon where euphoric garbage gets voted to the top. Reddit really is an interesting tool for gauging market sentiment.

I didn't mean to be glib and yes I understand that your concern is with hardware-based malware. The solution I just gave you also effectively covers the hardware malware scenario. 
Let's say for some reason there's hardware-based malware on the offline machine you use to sign the transaction. In that case, the malware could attempt to modify the transaction before signing (for example, the malware could swap in a hacker's address/pub-key for the original recipient's address/pub-key). However, you can check the signed transaction before broadcasting it using your online machine, so any malware, whether software or hardware based, would have to have control of both machines (the offline machine used to sign the transaction and the online machine used to broadcast the transaction) in order to successfully divert payment to an attacker's address, assuming you double-check the transaction both during the signing and broadcasting process, which you should always do anyway for significant amounts of Bitcoin.
Hope this helps.

This statement alone shows that you have no idea how offline signing works. The transaction, which includes the recipient address, is signed offline and any offline wallet worth its salt will verify the recipient address with the user before signing the transaction. There is absolutely nothing you can do by pwning the machine used to broadcast the transaction.

It should be obvious by now that "drug money" and "money laundering" are nothing but flimsy rhetorical constructs that the government and status quo parasites use to selectively put financial pressure on enterprises that they do not like - i.e., anything that threatens their power, either economically or in the marketplace of ideas.
If they really cared about drug abuse and money laundering, HSBC, Barclays, Citi Bank, et al. would be broken up or nationalized and all their executives would be in jail.
On the same note, almost every single word uttered by anyone working for the government at a high level is engineered to short circuit basic logic and manipulate the listener emotionally using inappropriate metaphors or disingenuous characterizations. Lakoff and Johnson talk a lot about this issue in their work on metaphors as a cognitive device. Basically, almost nothing that a stuffed suit says should ever be taken at face value and in many cases if you look closer you see that the metaphors are incomplete or do not make sense. For example:
- War on drugs: Not a real war, since real wars have victory conditions.
- War on poverty: Same issue here. Any "War on X" where X is not anther nation state is almost certainly bullshit.
- The nation as a family ("the homeland," "our [brave] X," etc.): This is one of the most disingenuous and self-serving metaphors of all which usually casts the government in a parental role. I suppose if you come from a family with narcissistic parents who claim ownership over you and 40% of your productive time long after you have moved out, then the government is somewhat like a family.
I could go on forever with this stuff, but I think you get the point.

If you're concerned about signing a transaction on a compromised system, sign the transaction on a separate piece of hardware that doesn't touch the internet. Simple as that.

This is what most people don't understand. The fact that bitcoin transactions are irreversible and bitcoins function like bearer bonds (i.e., do not require permission to transact) is a feature that the legacy financial system cannot duplicate. On the other hand, bitcoin transactions can be made reversible and consumer protection can be built in using third party services and, eventually, Bitcoin 2.0 layers on top of the blockchain. In other words, bitcoin, as a form of money, offers more robust functionality than the USD and FEDWire. 
Andreas Antonopolus addresses this issue quite eloquently in his [recent talk at DevCore](

Over 16% of sovereign debt is now trading at negative interest rates, up from 0% just a few years ago.
Think about that for a second. Investors all over the world have actually *given* money to sovereign entities for the privilege of buying 3.6 trillion USD in debt.
Why has this happened and why would anybody pay interest to a borrower for the privilege of having their money borrowed, you ask? Two reasons: (1) various central banks, including the European Central Bank, Swiss National Bank and Danish National Bank have already lowered deposit rates to negative territory out of desperation, effectively pushing interest on related sovereign debts below zero; and (2) investors expect that they will be able to beat inflation *even at negative interest rates*. That's right, by continuing to buy these bonds the market has effectively signaled that it expects inflation to be more negative than already negative interest rates.
This is especially interesting because the financial media is chock full of central bankers reassuring investors that deflation will not happen because "we are more powerful than the market" and "the economy is fine." Meanwhile [the labor participation rate in the US is at a 36 year low]( crude is down 60% and the middle class' standard of living continues to deteriorate while the bond market and interest rates are signalling deflation more strongly day by day. Who should we believe? Personally, I'd trust the market (broken as it is due to central bank intervention) far more than the bankers. If you had believed the SNB's talk about maintaining the CHFEUR peg and invested accordingly just two weeks ago you would have gotten obliterated.
If the market is right and deflation continues to set in get ready for central banks to continue on their path going full retard with increasingly negative interest rates until eventually average Joe's money market or savings account starts charging negative interest, at which point people with cash assets will just start stuffing paper notes under their mattresses rather than pay banks to hold their money. It is not hard to imagine that just as or right before we get to this point the Keynesian brain-trust of Krugman, et. al. will start demonizing rational people hoarding cash and will call for physical cash to be phased out in favor of electronic cash which ~~can be skimmed by the bankers with negative interest rates~~ can be "more easily tweaked to stimulate the economy" (personally I don't think this would be feasible, but it will still be proposed, just watch).
This all assumes, of course, that the whole financial house of cards stays up long enough for negative interest rates to exist over the long term. The longer the show goes on, the weaker the edifice becomes. The system may very well implode under its own weight before we even get to the point of negative interest rates for personal savings accounts.

Being an intellectual is about far more than academic titles.
I would say that academic honors are a necessary, but not sufficient condition. The real difference between a bona fide intellectual and a mere tool of the system is a matter for history to decide. (For example, there were many scientists back in the late 19th / early 20th centuries that advocated racist ideas not because they were scientifically valid, but rather because advocating such ideas was popular and ingratiated them with the existing power structure. Sound familiar?)   
Personally I think history will file Krugman and other prescriptive economists as sycophantic tools and opportunists whose contribution to real human understanding was trivial, though some may disagree.

I completely agree with this and you make a good point about the relatively higher level of technical literacy on Reddit, but that's not what said.
Am I wrong in thinking there's a big difference between saying more than 50% of the population is so retarded they cannot use their e-mail without monthly calls to tech support versus saying 50% of the population cannot fix general computer issues?
On a broader level, I honestly think that history has shown time and time again that new technologies are almost always difficult to use for the non-enthusiast at first but become much easier with time. If you had said in 1999 that in around a decade most people would be using "palm pilots" with built-in cell radios on a daily basis with the average teen using their devices many hours per day, people would have laughed at you and called you crazy. I owned a Windows CE device back in the day and everyone thought it was just some uber nerdy novelty. Same thing with PCs and the internet.
Arguments that boil down to "it's not easy enough to use" are pretty much a huge class of logical fallacy when it comes to discussing the future potential of a technology, but people still give this "argument" credence which is why the trolls love it.
