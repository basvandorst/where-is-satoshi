That actually seems ok for somebody like me - as I'm guessing they will do their best to secure those coins that back the shares?

Who said anything about 1-1 correspondence?

Have any of you looked at robinhood? I'm thinking of trying it to get into buying, but I'm not sure where it's held once you purchase.

I think I can get bitcoins by using expensify. 
My company is using expensify - so I'm going to try it. I can expense some things for my job, and one of the options is "pay in bitcoin" .. So I can "earn" bitcoins back by expensing stuff...
I'm going to submit my expense report on the 1st next month, and I'm going to try it.. And if it works, then this will be a great way to earn bitcoins.

Reminds me of the [Sun Modular Datacenter](

I tried posting this story earlier.. It didn't get many upvotes:

Sort of off topic, but how does the tip thing know my wallet? 
Or do I have to transfer it to my wallet once the tip is given?

Ah, neat. Thanks!

Does it work on mac?

I think I'll need a lot more than .01 though :/

This is why I have never bought any bitcoin.

:) - but in seriousness, back in the day I visited a few faucets. It didn't add up to much at all.

My .0058095 BTC wallet is on blockchain.info -- is this a problem for people with wallets on their site?
Should I move my coins somewhere else if I get serious about BC?

More than I have. I got 0.0058095 BTC from I think reddit back in the day.
I don't even know if I really have it either, because it says it's in "bitcointip" and not my "bitcoinwallet" -- and it would cost me like $3.50 to transfer it over? 
Seems like a lot of $ just to move it if I don't have to.. IDK, .. stuff like this is what makes BTC too confusing for the average pleb like me.

Ethereum, EOS, Cardano, Zcash, Monero, ... Ah who I am kidding? The real answer is clearly Doge.

So I'm noobish and a lurker, but I do have a question (it will probably be buried, but I'll take a shot):
I want to invest in bitcoin, but I don't want to own bitcoin directly because I'm afraid I will lose them/forget password/have them stolen/some other bad thing -- so I would like an ETF such that somebody else is mitigating those risks.
**Question:** Can't they do an ETF type vehicle on another exchange not regulated by the SEC? Like on the London, Tokyo, or even Hong Kong exchanges?? Is there somebody trying to do this?

There was a debit card that offered 2% cash back, it was from ["perkstreet" bank]( -- unfortunately they closed shop a while ago. I used the crap out of it when I had it.
