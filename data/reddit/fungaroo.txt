Kk. I live  somewhere with really cheap electricity and had someone approach me back in 2012-13 about trying to do something. Just been thinking about current possibilities of late

Would more nodes help increase the tps

How do/would nodes fit into this problem

Indeed. At this point there effectively needs to be an internet dedicated solely to the project really. There are solutions I’m sure, but they’re gonna have to be pretty far out of the box to work

Think about how many old computers and smartphones are just out there these days. I’ve been thinking it’d be interesting to harness them to run as nodes and help the network

ive learned to not pitch by telling people that the way you break the world as currently constructed is by breaking money, and BTC/cryptos are how you do that lol

all of which isnt helped by how its framed in corporate media, esp when a big price bump comes along
