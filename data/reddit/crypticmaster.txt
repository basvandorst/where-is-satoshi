3 questions:
1) In order to benefit from LN, it is almost equivalent to having a prepaid debit card/etc. in the sense I need to load up a payment channel with funds. I understand how this on the balance is a better solution than the current state, but a key point why many of use btc is to have absolute control over our funds - surely having to prepay is not convenient and transferring into a payment wallet which is out of my direct control is far from the ideal world bitcoin envisaged? 
2) by chaining multiple off-chain transactions that are not verified until payment channels are close leave all those transactions occurring off-chain vulnerable to manipulation etc. Ie. I deal with A, A deals with B, B with C and so forth all all the way until Z. If somewhere along the chain N was able to manipulate transactions with O, it would not only affect their transactions but mine as well as it passed through them and none of the potentially thousands of transactions have been verified by the blockchain. What if J, K and L were all related entities and had a way of manipulating the ledger between the two of them off-chain. Wouldn't that affect all my transactions as well?
3) Other than having the largest community currently, it seems we are constantly chasing our tail trying to fix the most basic of issues with what is now outdated tech - why are we not looking at other blockchain tech that has already solved these scaling issues and has fast, feeless minerless alternatives??
