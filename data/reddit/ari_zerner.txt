It's my understanding that Breadwallet is a little more secure than Electrum, but that's mainly because it runs on a more secure platform.

That doesn't solve the problem of doublespends, unless the deposit is made in advance of the payment, in which case it doesn't solve the problem of waiting around.

When Lightning Network is widespread, people will probably still say they're paying with Bitcoin.

My assets can't be frozen, my transactions can't be censored, and my finances aren't linked to my name. I also need to trust only that a majority of hashpower is non-malevolent, not that a single government organization is.

What's the difference between block mining and transaction verification?
@_date: 2015-12-24 03:03:04
At some point. As the number of bets you place approaches infinity, the probability of winning one approaches 1. When you win, you cash out, with a net winning equal to your initial bet.
@_date: 2015-12-24 00:14:51
If you have infinite money, that strategy is guaranteed to win. Of course, if you have infinite money, there isn't much point to gambling.
@_date: 2015-12-24 01:07:29
In total, winning more money than you bet.
@_date: 2015-12-26 07:15:56
Divisibility, not fungibility. Bitcoin actually has a bit of an issue with fungibility.
@_date: 2015-12-13 05:01:59
In the long run, that's true. In the short run however, it may be worthwhile for them to operate at a loss, as that could minimize their losses compared to shutting down.

I take issue with one of your statements:


Gold and silver have no more inherent value than Bitcoin. Their value, like Bitcoin's comes from the fact that people accept them as valuable. Bitcoin isn't tied to fiat any more than precious metals are. As currencies go, I would argue that Bitcoin is better than precious metals. As well as having most of the qualities that make precious metals good money, Bitcoin can easily be spent over large distances, and it has a fixed supply.
@_date: 2016-03-02 19:53:30
[Provident Metals]( gives a 3% discount if you pay with Bitcoin. I haven't bought much precious metal, so I don't know how they compare to other sites, but I had a fine experience with them.
@_date: 2016-01-16 07:40:38
I got a bit scared, then realized other people would be more scared and bought some coins when the price dropped.

The miner who includes a transaction receives the full fee, but only pays part of the cost of including that transaction. Miners will therefore include some inefficient transactions, that is, transactions for which total marginal cost &gt; total marginal benefit.

Foodler takes Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-03-10 19:35:43
I don't think so. I have a recurring purchase, and I just transfer what I've accumulated every once in a while.
Side note: I think you'll pay lower fees if you buy $20 worth every other week.
@_date: 2016-03-10 19:39:50
Bitcoin can't be recovered from a Bitcoin address. Unless you have the private keys, the Bitcoin is lost.
@_date: 2016-01-18 00:18:49
That ignores the tragedy of the commons. Sure, each miner would like it if all miners produced at the efficient level, but no individual miner has an incentive to. Also, that assumes that all full nodes are run by miners.
EDIT: By "produced", I mean included transactions in blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:28:18
And my point is that you don't get to determine the best use of the Blockchain any more than you get to determine the best use of land. Let people bid to use the space for their purposes, and the space will be used in the most valuable way.

@_date: 2016-01-17 20:52:27
A problem with that argument (and I'm not arguing for small blocks, just pointing out a flaw in that particular argument) is that there are negative externalities involved in including a transaction, so the market will overproduce transactions (include transactions with higher marginal cost than marginal benefit).
@_date: 2016-01-18 04:07:34
No. A net **winning** equal to your initial bet.

I don't think corporations need to be given personhood, but a company is simply a group of people. Restricting a company thus necessarily restricts the people in it.

I buy and hold because I'm not confident in my ability to time the market, but I am confident in Bitcoin's long-run ability to resist inflation.
@_date: 2016-01-04 01:37:39
I don't know about other wallets, but Electrum and Breadwallet both have that capability already. Small transfers shouldn't be banned. If someone is willing to pay the market rate for the network to record their half-cent transfer, there's no reason they shouldn't be allowed to.
@_date: 2016-01-10 03:36:41
Take a look at one of many addresses I control:
It's not that I think you're lying, because I don't see a motive, but if you claim that you control an address, it's really hard to take you seriously if you don't sign with that address.
@_date: 2016-01-13 06:31:35
Do you have a hardware wallet? If you're that concerned about losing your Bitcoin, you really should get one if you don't have one.

Recently asked someone this in a conversation about Bitcoin. I hope I didn't come off as rude. Will avoid doing so in the future.
@_date: 2016-03-13 09:29:57
You wrote "taking" instead of "talking".
@_date: 2016-01-04 23:07:16


It doesn't make sense to you, but the beauty of free markets is that they allocate resources to whoever values them most. If someone values their half-cent transaction more than you value your hundred dollar transaction, there's no good reason to prioritize your hundred dollar transaction.

This is why I'm HODLing.
@_date: 2016-06-04 07:28:45
I agree with all of your points except the last. There are well-known problems with sending back to an address.
@_date: 2016-06-02 00:36:29
I can imagine that, actually. If you can't, that suggests a failure of imagination.

You think a Trezor reduces the probability of Bitcoin getting stolen by 50 percentage points? That's ridiculous. The probability isn't that high to begin with.
@_date: 2016-12-12 12:01:08
So? What's the use case for that?
@_date: 2016-12-01 04:46:17

Is a soft one ok?
@_date: 2016-12-12 02:13:30
Trezor is really just for dealing with theft. Any other loss can be avoided by just making backups. Even so, I don't think the chance of all loss put together is 50%, nor do I think Trezor eliminates all of it.
@_date: 2016-02-06 23:48:40

It clearly says that it's a statement of intent, not a binding agreement.

Wait, why would mining have to change? There would be a difficulty adjustment for the square root difference, sure, but that's not fundamental.
@_date: 2016-09-25 21:11:57
@_date: 2016-10-16 06:36:58
Nope. The 160 bit brute-force security is to go from address to public key. Going from public key to private key by brute force is 256 bits (although I saw elsewhere in the thread that there's a shortcut that brings it down to 128 bits).
@_date: 2016-10-16 06:35:17
Why not?
@_date: 2016-10-16 07:57:54
Whoops, my bad. I was thinking of what it would take to get the private key, but I think you're right that any private key with a matching PKH would allow spending.

Any cross-platform HD wallet should work. If your mobile device runs Android, try Electrum.

A malicious miner could send its own Bitcoin to itself repeatedly in order to fill the block.


A miner with some portion of the hashing power will publish, on average, the same portion of the blocks, so it would eventually publish its giant block.


If enough nodes chose not to relay the block, that would work. However, if most nodes relayed the block, the remaining nodes would have to accept it.
@_date: 2015-11-08 22:23:25
That's impossible. For one person to sell dollars for Bitcoin, another person must sell Bitcoin for dollars.
@_date: 2015-11-27 06:45:25
You would have to find some way to make it provably fair. Otherwise most people would reasonably assume it was a scam.

Cool! Btw, the Shift card also exchanges when you make a transaction.
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:51:07
I don't think you do. Suppose you were only willing to accept one specific seed, and you continued generating seeds until you found that one (never mind how long this would take). Would that be random? Now, suppose instead you were only willing to accept two seeds, and followed the same process. Would that be random? Now, suppose instead you were only willing to accepts seeds that followed a specific pattern, such as alphabetical order. Would that be random? Now, suppose the pattern is telling a story. Is that random?

@_date: 2015-11-23 05:25:57
1) Receive Bitcoin for good or service.
2) Send Bitcoin to Coinbase "wallet".

Can you say more about that? Cutting fiat out of the loop entirely is a topic that interests me.
@_date: 2015-11-27 06:48:42
This. If my understanding of Bitcoin is correct, this should instead use OP_RETURN to include the proof and have the dust go to the miner.
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:28:26
I like the idea, but drop the "might be worth absurd amounts one day" bit. It also might be worth nothing. On average, people expect it to be worth what it's worth now, plus the time value of money, perhaps with some correction for the cost of risk.
@_date: 2016-07-05 19:48:20
To be fair, that wasn't a hack of the network, just of a smart contract.
