How is something explicitly allowed by the government outside the domain of its control?
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:29:04
"Uncontrollable by government" by definition implies illegality

Rights are constructs created by governments. That governments have limited rights is something that makes sense only in light of a higher law, such as a constitution. And even then, those limits are only preserved as far as the government is designed to withstand a power vacuum. When it fails, such as with the NSA spying program, there are no repercussions.
