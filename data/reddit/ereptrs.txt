For someone that doesn't have a CS,Math,or Physics background, is there any sense trying to learn TA as a beginning first year trader looking trade crypto?  From what I understand, TA (from what I know in stocks) is mainly used by day and swing traders correct?   Also, you seem fairly knowledgeable and I'm a bit naive at how trading in general functions at these crypto exchanges.  
When crypto trading, I'm assuming traders are generally trying to predict where the market is going to be at a given point in time by using whatever TA tools they have at their disposal (MACD, Candlestick patterns, Elliot Waves,etc)  Not that I would day trade crypto , but just to understand how these markets work, is a beginning trader going to be at a severe disadvantage simply because he/she will be trading amongst of traders that are more experienced in TA trading?

Are you using TA primarily to determine where to get in at?  I assume  you're in for the long term and not trading?
Seems like the learning curve is steep for a beginning trader. I'm familiar with Fibonacci retracements and know a little bit about candlestick patterns, but would like to know how far this would get me in terms of trading in the crypto market.

Yeah, it doesn't make sense meaning if TA had a high degree of reliability then eventually things would catch on then everyone would be getting rich (or markets would adapt, but I don't know how that would work).   
What I find interesting are some of the traders on sites like tradingview that are willing to share their TA.   It seems like anyone can call themselves an expert but really all you need to do is backtest the data.
