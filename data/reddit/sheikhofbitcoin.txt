I think Bitcoin will never be allowed to go mainstream until the banks and hedge funds have had their share. Mainstream will probably come in after that to buy bits and satoshis. HODL like a spartan. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:43:27
The whole point of Trezor is that you can spend safetly even on a comprimised machine.
@_date: 2014-06-08 10:17:11
Because bitcoin is the solution and the way out from their ponzi scheme. I have a feeling they are indirectly recommending a switch to bitcoin, while all other central banks are issuing warnings.

Im from the Middle East and thats exactly what I thought while reading it. Its a hoax. I hope the next step wont be to ban bitcoin because its used by the nasty terrorists. 
Werent they "Friendly Freedom Fighters" supported by the US a few months ago? Same way the US supported Alqaeda's fight against Russia. 
I think its pretty easy to finance a group like that here. People pay zakat (islamic tax) and God knows where that money goes. The regulation is very weak with these organizations. 
The other problem is that they dont have a face and a lot of people support them ideologically with representatives in all ME countries.
They dont even need bitcoin for funding.

So you're saying that Wallstreet will pump it so high that volatility wont be an issue, other countries, major finance firms and corporations  will scramble to try to get some of this digital gold. Then they will pump it even higher and sell it to the mainstream.
Wallstreet will once again be the leader of the financial world in the new era.
Meanwhile fiat keeps getting deflated so even merchants would rather hold bitcoin. Small countries fiat systems will collapse one by one into the blockchain...
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:09:38
Just realized that, thanks
@_date: 2014-12-28 20:20:38

@_date: 2014-06-10 08:21:47
I thought everyone wants to go to the moon? Including them. Everything is manipulated but with bitcoin it will be much harder incomparison to something like gold as we dont have worthless paper derivatives and the supply is extremely limited. My guess is if manipulation will happen then it will be by significantly increasing the price first. The report they posted is also one of the most positive i have read so far - bookmarked in favourites.

There probably are some "better" altcoins, but I think the current network effect bitcoin currently has will make it almost impossible to beat.
Bitcoin will succeed first, before anything else comes along.
@_date: 2014-12-29 18:49:31
I actually think this scenario is the most accurate the way things are going.
The US will continue to lead the world by being the earliest adopter of bitcoin.
Just wait till Wallstreet comes in, and this will become more clear.
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:49:38
Whos gonna fix it? I dont know if this is procrastination or something is going on in the background. Why should it take so long for someone such as CEX or Gavin or Andreas to even issue a basic statement?

Your vision makes sense from a financial perspective to protect public funds amd I agree with that part, but I think you will always need people to run things. You will always need doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers etc. and they will have to be governed somehow, but not by a robot. I think the benefit of the blockchain is to make public funds and spending transparent and make it harder for corrupt politicians/businesses. We should also remember there are a lot of different religious beliefs and ideologies at play in different parts of the world so this wont nessessarily work everywhere. I feel your vision is to transform the world into the matrix, and honestly thats not where I want my children to live.

Ive been interested in world economics and "conspiracy theories" since 8 years, but always got depressed the more I read because I felt helpless and doomed... until I discovered bitcoin and something in my head "clicked": this is the ark.

God is not in the business of giving "repeated and obvious evidence", otherwise there is no point in giving you a brain to make a decision for yourself during your short life which will inevitably result in death. God is basically putting us in a exam senario, the result of which will be an eternity in heaven or hell. There is a lot of scientific and even mathematical evidence in the Qoran if you care to do a Google search, but thats probably just a "conspiracy for terrorists".

I dont trust Brock or the foundation, but this could be the positive possible senario.

Then why dont you teach us a bit of your fuckin wisdom? Another all-knowing nitwit?
First lets make something clear: I will say whatever the fuck comes on my mind at any time I like.
The way you talk makes me believe I am older, wiser and definitely better than educated than you, so I feel obliged to teach you a thing or too, hopefully.
Going around reddit bashing everyones posts without any positive argument is just too fucking stupid.
You seem to be deeply angered by anyone who has a slightly higher IQ than you based on your posting history.
I have a feeling ur just a zit faced athiest piece of shit working at Carls Junior but you watched a few shows on Fox news so now you feel like an expert. I believe for 99% thats probably true.
Its safe to say your just another one of those "sheeple" who cant think outside the box or even imagine anything not scientifically proven in the highschool biology book.
My advice is to get off the fucking meth. Its fucking up your already taenia solium infested brain and making you way to stupid to be of any use to anyone.

I really enjoy your posts because you eloquently put what im thinking into words.
I think the UAE is onto this because they are business savy and open-minded rather than a hint from the US.
Notice how Singapore (banking capital of the east) is also into this.
I personally dont consider China and Russia to be enemies, but their thinking is a bit backwards. Maybe they will try to push for a gold standard when the hammer hits, but it cant compete with bitcoin in this age.
Keep posting and hopefully more people will see the blindingly bright signs because of you.
I hope you enjoy your early retirement, I know I will ;) May God bless you and keep you healthy and free.

The Middle East can be considered a single entity sometimes. If one country (or city i.e. Dubai) embraces Bitcoin then the rest will naturally follow like a heard of camels.

I still dont get your point.
Crypto and fiat are opposites.

The other is an inflationary piece of paper that has some numbers on it to represent value, or some numbers in a central database that take 3 days to send to the bank next door.

The whole value of the bitcoin system stems from its decentralized nature. No mining pool or entity should ever reach anything close to 50%. There should be rules or a concensus to limit large miners somehow. I understand its a "free-market" but at 51% it wont be considered free anymore. The question is what if that crazy someone had 2 or 3 knives at the same time?

Currency news = relevant.

I think Bitstamp should tell me how much I can deposit or withdraw without suddenly being interrogated, like Kraken.
Even after getting verified and one interrogation, they told me they might require me to do it yet again next time I deposit. No thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-12 12:16:20
Same here!
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:20:19
I know, and I have to doubts in it.

Beautiful. Thanks a lot.

Security seems very tight, you can setup 2FA for everything and a even a seperate "master" 2FA. Not sure about how their audit works, you can check their site.

At this point the average consumer would probably need dollars.
Circle provides a way to instantly send dollars free using bitcoin.
Once bitcoin is mainstream no one will need to convert back to dollars.

What other reason would make them buy contracts settled in bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:55:08
The contract is settled in bitcoin. Why isnt it bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:57:46
But what if institutions are actually using it to accumilate? How is it only speculation?
@_date: 2019-11-28 19:03:09
Regulations? Complicated custody and storage?

Did they mention when moon?

Fake news trying to stop people from fleeing to gold.

To keep people stuck in fiat currencies
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:40:14
Check how much you sent in bitcoin and substract
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:37:27
You invested more than you can afford to lose
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:59:25
That makes sense, thanks!

Where did you get the 500k volume?

My second! Cant wait to see "All-time high" flashing on bitcoinity again.
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:26:54
You must be new here...
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:24:21
Probably up to 1000
@_date: 2015-11-09 07:20:06
I can buy up to $200,000 in bitcoin per month, if you're interested ;)
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:04:50
Sorry this comment was meant for another post. My bad! The really good days are coming hopefully.

It will probably continue to surge and retreat, until it doesnt...

If they dont believe in the petrodollar then they must be terrorists. Expect a lot of fireworks soon.

I think they meant $400 (k)?

It's 2018, not much use for oil anymore :(

No. All currency news is relevant, because guess what... Currency is the first app of bitcoin!

" Half of the general public favors banning Bitcoin, while large majorities strongly favor severe regulations"
Triple facepalm.
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:28:05
Maybe the competitors will use bitcoin? The thing about bitcoin is anyone can use it for free and without permission. It has a great advantage.

Bitcoin is currently useless at funding anything bigger than a small startup cupcakery. This is zionist israeli banker FUD
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:56:27
Can the problem even be fixed? Maybe theoretically yes, but in the real world i doubt it will. A fiscal union would be a great way to consolidate power by the reptilian people (tin-foil hat on)

The private key for the bitcoins. How is it setup?
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:40:27
This is the Bitcoin. Watch it hash in slow motion.
It's pretty badass. Look. It hashes all over the place. "Whoa! Watch out!" says that bank.
Eew, it's got encryption! Oh! It's chasing a merchant service! Oh my gosh!
Oh, the Bitcoin is just crazy!
The Bitcoin has been referred to by the Guiness Book of World Records as the most fearless currency on the planet. It really doesn't give a shit. If it's hashing, it's mining.
Eew! What's that in its block chain? Oh, it's got a double-spend? Oh, it runs backwards? Now watch this: look FinCEN's up in courts. Bitcoin don't care. It just confirms what it wants. Whenever it's mining it just -- Eew, and it mines, transactions... Watch it reward! Look at that mining.
The Bitcoin is really pretty badass. It has no regard for any other currency whatsoever. Look at it, it's just hashing, and mining blocks. Eew! What's that? Silk Road? Oh that's nasty. Bitcoin's so nasty. Oh look it's hashing things and mining them.
The Bitcoin has a fairly long block chain, but a distinctly elliptical encryption scheme, and, you know, its developers are loose, allowing it to move about freely, and they twist around.
Now look: Here's a house full of gold bugs. Do you think the Bitcoin cares? It doesn't give a shit, it goes right into the homes of libertarians to get some liquidity. How disgusting is that? It mines silk road transactions. Eew, that's so nasty.
But look! The Bitcoin doesn't care! It's users get hacked like a thousand times. It doesn't give a shit. It's just mining. It doesn't care about being hacked by the feds. Nothing can stop the Bitcoin when it's mining. What a crazy fuck! Look, it's mining anonymous transactions, that's disgusting.
It's hashing in slow-motion again. See?
Now, what's interesting is that other currencies like the dollar here, they just wait around until the Bitcoin crashes, and then it swoops in to pick up the scraps. It says, "You do all the work for us, Bitcoin, and we'll just profit whatever you mine, how's that? What'daya say, stupid?"
Look at this currency: "Thanks for the treat, stupid!"
"Hey, come back here," says the Bitcoin.
Currencies don't care, and you know what? The alt-coins do it too. Look at these little alt-coins. They're like "Thanks stupid! Thanks for the mining! See you later." The Bitcoin does all the work and all these other currencies just pick up the scraps.
At nightime the Bitcoin goes mining, because it's hashing. Look! Here comes a fierce battle between a government currency and Bitcoin. I wonder what will happen?
Look at this, there's the Bitcoin just hashing a block, and then look, "Get away from me!" says the government, "Get away from me!" Bitcoin don't care. Bitcoin smacks the shit out of it. And the government comes back and it lashes at the Bitcoin.
Oh, little does the Bitcoin know, FYI: it's been hacked! It's been forked by the 51% attack, so while it's hashing the block chain -- eew, that's disgusting -- all the hacked blocks are seeping into the Bitcoin's block chain, and it forks out. Look at that forked fuck.
Now the Bitcoin is going to fork out for a few minutes, and then it's going to get right back up and start hashing all over again, because it's a resiliant little bastard.
Look at this! Like nothing happened! The Bitcoin gets right back up and continues hashing the block chain.
How disgusting.
And of course, what does the Bitcoin have to hash for the next two weeks?
The Bitcoin: it doesnt give a shit™

You could probably afford to employ a small SWAT team and some ninjas to guard you if you're that paranoid. Dont forget the bulletproof Maybach.
