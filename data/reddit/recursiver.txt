This was a feature of Bitcoin? Wow, now I'm definitely staying away from this thing.
The rest of what you say may be called a feature, but that is something different. They are both effects of the nature of Bitcoin, but saying that the buyer suffers loss in case of fraud is *a feature*... damn!
With regards to  I have the same answer: I still don't understand why you'd call the risk of losing money *a feature*.
I was not aware Bitcoin had this many awful features built into it, but I'm pretty convinced to stay away from it now.

How much memory would a wallet need?

~~If it's Turing complete, it can run a Bitcoin wallet. It's not a mandatory condition, but a sufficient one. So the answer to the question is it can definitely run a Bitcoin wallet.~~
**edit** No. See below.

Got a source for this? I highly doubt it is true.
