I'm actually not sure which vocal minority you are speaking about here.   The bitcoin sexperts or the 8MB proponents?

~~Using linear extrapolation of [this chart]( would have us touching 1MB within the next 18-24 months.~~
**edit**: See link below.
Drawing lines on charts is by no means definitive,  but it holds no less merit then your statement.

Thanks for the chart,  I definitely hold it in higher regard than the one I sourced.

No doubt.  However each one of us makes up that consensus,  even if our point of difference is near inconsequential.

Why don't we put these tests in place on `testnet`?

I don't deny that.  But a fork without 95% consensus is not something I'd like to be a part of.

Except it isn't.
There is already the beginnings of [black listing in XT]( that I don't agree with (Tor exit nodes only or otherwise).
I just want core with 8MB,  [does that exist](

Except XT isn't the same as Bitcoin.
There is already the beginnings of [black listing in XT]( that I don't agree with (Tor exit nodes only or otherwise).
I just want the core software with support for 8MB... [does that exist?](
