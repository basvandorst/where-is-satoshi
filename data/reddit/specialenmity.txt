The real world improvement in block size that seg wit provides with a base block size of 1 and full deployment is .7. So we will get 1.7 equivalent blocks in real world conditions. The problem is you can't design  for real world conditions you have to design for adverse conditions. If the network was attacked with spam or such then it is possible to create transactions that are more geared toward being stored SW style so that the equivalent blocksize isn't 1.7 but rather 4 MB. That means the whole network nodes and all has to be able to accomodate 4 MB blocks even though in real world conditions we are only getting 1.7 ones with full deployment of segwit. This continues to be true if in the future the blocksize is raised further. If base blocksize was 100 MB then seg wit would provide 170MB of realistic througput but the network would have to be able to handle 400 MB .
Most people like segwit except: That it is being done as a soft fork instead of a hard fork which makes it a hacky solution and that it subsidizes certain kinds of transactions over others (which introduces this "attack vector")

The whole purpose of mining is to make transactions happen properly. It is just a different perspective to see the lightning network as a way to make transactions happen. The more people that are connected with payment channels the easier it should theoretically be. The more stake you have the more connections you should have.

ads aren't part of content since they are linked from a different server but even if you did consider them part of someones content, how would it be criminal to serve less than the full content? Content minus adds is less than content plus ads.
I think you can break the argument down into simple terms:
Does a company have the right to create a web browser? Obviously they do.
Does a company have the right to include their own ads in their own software? Obviously they do. So a browser has a right to include their own ads.
Does a browser have a right to block the ads of a website? If it doesn't then google is in trouble because the adblock extension does just that. 
Also consider the security and bandwidth implications. If a web browser doesn't have the right to block ad content then is the advertiser responsible for the security fees that will inevitably come from malware? Are they also responsible for bandwidth fees from  legally forcing people to see ad content? They don't pay for the users bandwidth... they don't pay for the users security and they don't pay for the users hardware so in no legitimate way should they be able to force this upon people.

As much as I might like the idea of yours, I almost feel that the only way to be valuable as a news source is to never get large enough to attract the attention of a resource rich organization willing to buy you. If everyone congregates to the same media sources then those are easy to compromise because you only have to compromise a few. So what we really need when it comes to news and information is decentralization but in a different kind of way... in a way where everything is so spread out that it is impossible to buy all of them off. For instance now reddit is so large and popular that hillary clinton is paying a million to have people target it and try to control what people perceive about her.

I'm tired of this whole  "blocksize doesn't effect scaling" narrative. There are no scaling solutions. There are just scaling improvements and tradeoffs. Segregated witness improves scaling somewhat. The amount it improves scaling is less than a mere 2 MB block size increase. But that also changes depending upon the base block size. If the block size were already 2 MB then SW witness would be a greater capacity increase than increasing by 1 MB or to 3 MB. But that comes with a tradeoff. If the attack vector of a seg witness block is 4 to 1 (Which means under ideal circumstances the block size is minimum, but under adverse circumstances the block size from is 4 times that it means that essentially seg witness is a worse scaling improvement than simply raising the block size not just from 1 to 2 MB but for every MB thereafter.

This is actually kind of pissing me off. What right do advertisers think they have to control what happens on the screen of some user who owns their own hardware? If I own my monitor and my computer then I can make my screen look how I want. I can adjust my monitor and change the color levels. I can use different browsers and they each have different logos. I can override the websites font. When you do a google search, do you not see search results mixed with advertisements that benefit google? Indirectly google is making money off the content of the entire enternet by hosting a search platform. There is nothing wrong with that.

hypothetically speaking, if satoshi saved his private keys he left them all in 50 BTC addresses. That means you would simply add up all the 50 bitcoin addresses that have never moved since before he disappeared and a good portion of them could be him. The trust in question said the private keys exchanged hands instead of moving actual coins on the block chain so it wouldn't be traceable.

"Exchanges and non-mining economic actors can reduce the blocksize in a straightforward manner. All they have to do is create a version of the code that rejects blocks greater than a certain size, and convince a small minority of the hashrate to use their version. Since their code would reject large blocks, it would always consider the small-block fork to be the longest valid chain, regardless of how long the large-block chain was.

Sounds like theymos reasoning.  Just because there isn't a hard fork doesn't mean there can't be one.  The idea is that there should be hard forks if it's in everyone's self interest.  A new inflation schedule wouldnt be.  If bitcoin used broken encryption them it would be in everyone's interest to hard fork.  If you didn't then it would be worthless.  The ability to hard fork makes bitcoin stronger because it can adapt to adversarial conditions. I'm just an investor. I have bitcoin and no alternative currencies except dollars.  I would invest more of bitcoin increased block size because then it would be worth more.  Even with the improvements underway,  bitcoin doesn't have a future  long term as the backbone of a payment network.  It will be to costly and people will use something that can get the job done economically

Build a decentralized reputation system. Open Bazaar is coming out with their own but there really needs to be a global reputation system where anyone can be rated for any kind of thing. Utilize bitcoin and smart contracts. So rootstock/open transactions / stash . How it works: A merchant providing something wants to build reputation. They deposit a fee into the smart contract. In return they get colored coins that act as virtual receipts given out to users who use their services. Users can then write a review on the service using one of the colored coins as proof of purchase. Figure out how to store the data and files this will need. Maybe it's joystream. Maybe the deposit that the merchants pay to get rated goes toward seeders on joystream.  Maybe use factom instead. Build a database of reviews that a "block explorer" like service can then browse and rank things. If a users review is ranked based on how many unique merchants they have used and each of these merchants all had to pay for a deposit this neatly raises the cost it takes to create a sybil attack.

I can't wait for the "important consensus" , meaning miners and the economic majority to route around these guys.
Failure can come from economic means. Imagine what would have happened if the block size cap was simply set at  .1MB. You would have run the network as normal for a few years , but then we would have hit that cap. Using the same argument he is making here, you would have kept the cap. And where would we be today? We would be left with a less successful, less decentralized and less valuable money system because not many would use it.
He is also contradicting himself.

Fear is a good way to get people to give up their rights. In this case monetary sovereignty is a right provided by bitcoin.
It seems odd to me how people will fall for it though. Case in point: The hijackers of 9/11. They trained at flight schools right? Why would it matter what type of money these guys used to pay for flight school? Does that make the money somehow bad? Did banks somehow prevent them being funded? If a terrorist buys coffee is the money used for that coffee somehow evil? Did it allow him to commit his act of terror? Even the government admits that it doesn't really cost much to be a terrorist.
With terrorists, governments have the infinite bogeyman they always wanted. A terrorist is someone who "hates us". You can't destroy hate. Therefore you can't ever eradicate "terrorists". It is an infinite perpetual war that will never be won, but that isn't the point of it anyway. The irony of the war on terror is that terrorists "hate us for our freedom".

This makes the assumption that the amount of hashing power that is securing the network is the right amount. It's designed to go up (and down) for a reason.
@_date: 2015-12-13 01:26:14
My personal theories:
Bitcoin makes certain types of taxation harder. Estate taxes for instance. But other types it is exactly the same (sales tax, property tax).
Government has a mutually beneficial relationship with banks. Banks write them checks and create money. This creates the illusion that governments "can't print all the money they want". Even though they can get it.
Because of this mutually beneficial relationship there isn't a reason for governments to accept bitcoin in the form of taxes. Since bitcoin can't pay taxes, and since bitcoin won't be deemed "legal tender" which means people are forced to accept it but fiat is, then government money will stick around. A government *could* benefit from a cryptocurrency like bitcoin for a few reasons. If that government was a first mover in acquiring bitcoin, then they would profit the most. Such a move would provide a price rally and would also provide immediate gains. Bitcoin makes certain municipal functions much easier. If it is accepted at parking meters and tolls, it would be much easier to pay. There is a theory that good money will drive out badmoney. It's probably true on a level playing field. But real world politics aren't that at all.

in 20 years a dollar won't even be worth the purchasing power of 50 cents today. The world population will grow by over a billion. The block reward will be less than a full bitcoin. And 8 GB blocks will probably seem tiny for a worldwide borderless  currency / digital gold / settlement system. Right now there are 3600 coins rewarded as a subsidy at a value around 350 dollars each. That's 1.2 million dollars a day that is used to encourage the security of the bitcoin network at the current market cap of around 5 billion. In 20 years, with less than a bitcoin as a reward to the miners an 8 GB block would give a nice size to accrue enough transactions to maintain the security of the network. Even if a bitcoin 20 years from now was worth a million dollars that wouldn't be enough to secure the network because the market cap would be much larger proportionately than now. And that's speaking in the future. In the near term we are at the brink of being bottlenecked and pushing transactions elsewhere. Elsewhere doesn't mean layer 2 because layer 2 doesn't exist yet. Layer 2 means paypal or western union or some alt coin.

An attacker that wanted to fill up block space would have to spend more if the block size was larger because the miners are in charge of what fees to include. If the block size was X amount then miners could set a minimum fee of y if blocks were actually full because you would want a minimum fee if blocks were actually full since including transactions below that minimum wouldn't get you optimum revenue. If x was double (times 2) and the minimum fee was still y then you could make double revenue.
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:58:44
I agree as well, but Peter__R pointed out something a couple weeks ago... one of the reasons there is a lack of compromise is because economically the choice is binary... either keep the block size above demand while technologically feasible to let the free market decide fees or use it as a policy tool. The core devs want policy tool. They want to teach the userbase a lesson. They want us to not think we can simply increase the blocksize whenever there is demand because it could become a destabilizer. Problem is there is no need for that. It's just going to slow growth for now.

I agree. I meant a friendly debate. I would find it very interesting for two reasons:
1. Chris presented a pretty convincing case that open transactions / stash are going to be better for smart contracts that don't need censorship resistance , which is where ethereum would come in. I forget which part of which video that is from
2. Chris talks about proof of work like the title says and he thinks that it is superior than other ways (But i'm not sure if he specifically mentioned proof of stake) . Vitalik is a big supporter of proof of stake and he probably thinks proof of work is barbaric.  
I'm skeptical about proof of stake but I think if it really does well then bitcoin could simply adopt it eventually , maybe?

If the lightning network is like ripple, then that is the best news I have heard in a while. (i'm for bigger blocks by the way). I'm slightly skeptical it's as good as ripple was though. Ripple as a payment system was superior because trading IOU's gives you more flexibility. I didn't realize that the ripple project was changed and bought out and not the same as it was. I used to have 50k ripple from the giveaway.
Despite that I am excited about the similarity, I think there should still be a block size increase. I believe it is irresponsible not to increase block size and start phasing it in the code now. 
People (are saying Seg witness is already like a block size increase to 2MB so anything more would be "too much". The problem with this logic is everything takes time. By the time you roll out seg witness, you could help propagation times and do other things like is working on. A block size increase is a simple change to the code, whereas they are building an entire new data structure with seg witness that introduces complexity. Instead of relying on SW, instead of pissing everyone off and waiting and waiting and not giving clear indications of when the network is getting a block size increase, just do it now and phase it in so that it takes effect before the halving. The network will be able to handle it and it won't Kill lightning and it will give us a little bit of breathing room.

IMO wallet software probably won't default to rbf. If the block size stays 1mb it will end up being a default because transactions will be so expensive that a fee market develops and an ordinary transaction  that normally has no business opting into rbf willl do it for economical reasons.

here is a fun fact. Back when the price of bitcoin started to rise after the first halving it was around 13 dollars. This was in januaryish of 2013. I sent dollars to mount gox but I also bought a miner for around 1300 I think. At the time that would have bought 100 coins. By the time the miner got to me (months later) the amount that I mined with that miner was only about 2.5 bitcoins. Granted we are talking about butterfly labs here.
I guess the point is that it is probably very predictable that China would get this majority in hashing power that they have. The Chinese government purposefully devalued their currency and kept it low to attract production to china. Now there all these factories in China that can produce asics. It only makes sense that someone in china figured out that the usual business of producing things and selling them to the rest of the world wasn't the best idea with bitcoin miners because they could just turn them on and mine for themselves. Consequently we have the problematic situation with f2pool that we have today.

first problem is you don't know what the wealth distribution is. You assume, but that's it. You can't prove what coins are lost. You can't prove how many people own coins.
The only thing that really matters is price stability and that is helped by holders. If there are people with large amounts it's because they either bought it at a recent high amount or they have held them for a long time since it was worth a small amount, through the ups and downs of the price corrections.  It's quite meaningless.
If you think about it the people that are at the most advantage are the exchanges. What happens if an exchange charges a percent of every bitcoin trade and they NEVER sell the bitcoin from these trades? Over time they could acquire a good chunk of the bitcoin market (If they could afford to do that).

When you have on chain and off chain transactions a competition naturally forms where people move to off chain for cheaper transactions. If you do not increase the block size enough that advantage further goes towards off chain transactions. One of the problems with this , all conflicts of interest aside.. is that to secure the actual bitcoin network you need transactions on the actual blockchain. By limiting blocksize you are limiting the revenue miners will receive as the subsidy for mining decreases... putting the whole network at risk. Off chain transactions only have value if the actual blockchain has value which means it is secured in proportion to the value that is represented by it. You are going to need large blocks in the future even if the main blockchain is not a true transaction network, but a settlement network because you are going to have to have a large portion of miners reward as fees from transactions so you are going to need a large amount of transactions.

@_date: 2015-12-16 14:02:30
It's funny how some small block proponents think forcing a scarcity of block space will create high fees and that will "save" bitcoin from not having enough security. High transaction fees won't save bitcoin from not enough security if the  future price of bitcoin is not high enough because only a high price will give a reason for users to pay such high fees in the first place which means you don't need to force a fee market on people.

I'm not sure if it's backwards thinking or some kind of time lapse thinking. The idea is that far into the future if bitcoin is so successful that many people use it all their tiny transactions won't fit on the blockchain. That's true. But why artificially restrict transactions NOW when that time isn't for years? Bitcoin can continue to grow and scale and handle things like payments until layer 2 is developed. Those things themselves are years into the future. Without a blocksize increase you could drastically reduce the usability of the network in the short term, and maybe even in the long term since it would reduce investment.

SW is cool, but its coolness comes from the fraud proofs, not from the capacity. **-jtoomim**




Segregated witness is likely to take at least as long. And then AFTER the network supports it, wallets need to start producing segregated witness transaction.
My blog post talks about all of that, and that is why SW is NOT a "short term solution" for blocks filling up unless you think "short term" is a year or more from now. **-gavin**

unimportant screamers? There is a good chance that the economic majority are going to try to fork around bitcoin core in the coming year. If SW + a 1 MB increase in 6 months is "dangerous"  even with all the improvements happening in that time frame then one has to wonder if there is a problem in how we are defining "danger". Gavin already said that a likely rollout where SW is actually used in the wild and employed by wallets is more like 1 year from now. If a block size increase doesn't come for "at least ~1year" that means it's much more than a year because a rollout there also takes time.  If the 45% statistic is true, it just means that even though we are filling blocks now we aren't in a crisis *now*. If block stream was smart they would take the wind out of the sails of any forks by increasing the block size by 1 megabyte before the halving. It would prove a lot of things and go a long way.
@_date: 2015-12-06 05:54:48
here is my guess. Exchanges work by having bidders and sellers. The "current" price of bitcoin was the last price it was bought at. When you try to sell your bitcoin it takes the current "bid" price. It's possible that coinbase doesn't have much liquidity yet with euros so there aren't very many bidders and that is why there is a low bid price for euros.

If litecoin is better, then bitcoin can't be better in terms of usage. If litecoin takes away usage from bitcoin then it doesn't destroy bitcoin but it reduces the amount bitcoin otherwise would have risen. It makes sense to do this if you have a million plus litecoins that would rise to a value of at least 10%. They would probably make 50 million dollars , because the fact of the matter is scaling solutions are vapor ware right now and litecoin isn't.

the public address of any wallet that contains bitcoins is known to everyone because in order to send bitcoin to a wallet you need a public address and the transaction must be included in the public ledger. So in short... if funds are getting added to your wallet there is no danger whatsoever. If funds are being taken out of it that is another matter.

something you might want to consider is the difference between the current state of things and the future state of things. For instance in the future bitcoin might be a really great travellers currency if it is accepted at enough places. You can spend your credit card abroad but you usually pay extra fees for this.

I don't even think the current infrastructure can handle massive buying to push to 10k. Most of the US is served by coinbase and they run out of coins all the time. ATM's would help but they are in regulatory limbo. Also  in the last 2 months probably millions of people across the world learned about bitcoin and they will dismiss it.......... until a year goes by and they notice that it went up in value and that it is not just a gimmick. I bet the value won't rise much in 2014  (but still be higher than the start which was 700 something) but 2015 it will I bet.

The "reference implementation" is bitcoin-qt and it is used for users wallets. There is no danger that a user is going to scam themselves by affecting the transaction ID. There is nothing to gain from someone else affecting the transaction ID either. On an exchange however it is a serious issue to not be vulnerable to this and the reason mt gox was is because they failed on several levels.

I could be wrong but I am pretty sure that if you buy mining equipment with your bitcoins you don't come out ahead. Especially if the market is rising.  For instance I originally paid $1300 for my miner. It could have bought 85 bitcoins at the time I bought it. So if I bought the miner with bitcoins I already had then I would have spent 85 bitcoins. Guess how many bitcoins it ended up mining? 4.

with armory you can keep your wallet on a computer that is not connected to the internet and wireless is turned off. On a computer that you use that is online you keep your "watching only wallet" . This lets you monitor your balance. When you want to spend coins you start to create the transaction from your online computer and you save it to a USB stick where it is "unsigned" . You then plug that usb stick into your offline computer and sign the transaction. You will need your password on the offline computer to sign the transaction. Then you take the stick back to your online computer and you broadcast the transaction and it goes. Your funds were never at risk from hackers. If someone broke into your house they couldn't take coins from your offline netbook since it is encrypted.  Additionally you will want to make backups of your wallet. The backups should be treated like paper wallets in that they are unsecured so if someone finds them they don't need your password or anything to retrieve the funds so store the backups (you can do electronic or paper) somewhere really safe.

it would actually push bitcoin higher. If it created a sincere clone of bitcoin it would be interchangeable with bitcoin and if it had any value (such as in the acceptance of tax) then bitcoin would also have that value since it would be interchangeable with bitcoin.

The only way you can get significant amounts of money into or out of bitcoin is to use an exchange. So regulate exchanges? And allow localbitcoins and BTM's to thrive as long as they stay under certain limits? You don't need to regulate businesses that accept bitcoin since it is in a businesses best interest to act honestly while it is in a consumers best interest to act dishonestly.

It seems to me that providing blockchain info doesn't provide enough information... if you show them the transaction how do they know that the receivers address is the receivers and not yours?

If bitcoin was mainstream and you were paid in bitcoins and the place you were sending had places that accepted bitcoins as payment there is no currency conversion or losses necessary and you would effectively pay about 10 cents to transfer.

4. The storage of bitcoins is the issue here. You can make the storage of bitcoins more secure or less secure than cash. You can make the security of your bitcoins more secure than potentially any other thing you own...  As hardware and software wallets advance and bitcoin banks come into existence it becomes less of an issue but still one that will always be present to some degree because with freedom comes responsibility.
3. The 51% attack is talked about in Satoshi's white paper. It's well known and it's funny how when people mention this from satoshi's white paper they also don't include the few words he mentions in regards to this attack..... that there is a financial disincentive to do this. Also a mining pool gaining 45% of the market does not even come close to having a 51% attack. If you think that you don't understand what a mining pool actually is....... a collection of miners all acting in their own self interest.
2. Bitcoin doesn't eliminate the need to pay taxes. It makes some taxes more difficult to enforce though....like estate taxes. So what?

One of the problems I see with gox is not that they are dying or not dying... it is that they are stuck in a limbo where they are still allowing trading and creating a panic on their exchange. This means there could be massive amounts of money sucked out of the bitcoin ecosystem in general. If there ever was a time where someone wanted to manipulate the price of bitcoin now is a time. If you had lots of coins you could still easily move them to gox and crash them and although the rest of the market isn't crashing to the same level mt gox is still acting like an anchor and dragging the price down.

The gox situation has to come to some sort of conclusion. Good or bad. My guess is that it will come to a conclusion within 1 or 2 more weeks at the most. If it's bad news the price will drop. Some people think even if mt gox resumes withdrawals the price will also drop but I don't think so. Why would people who held bitcoins on mt gox suddenly rush to sell them? They obviously held bitcoins for a reason. Because they were playing the market or because they were savers... so I think it is wrong to assume they will suddenly sell all their holdings and quit being involved with bitcoin

Overstock has a real opportunity here to experiment with other things such as fractional payment of their employees in bitcoin. For instance when you use bitpay (I am not sure if coinbase can do this , verify?) You as a merchant can choose something like 99% dollar and 1% btc as the split for your payment. They could then route those btc to whichever employees volunteer to be paid in a portion in bitcoins. That's what I am hoping eventually happens. Bitcoin needs to start making the full rounds.

Even if there was some change to the bitcoin software to appease mt gox and deal with their ineptness.......... notice something. The other change that took place in february that they mentioned didn't start making real problems until recently. Why? Because a change in the bitcoin software is generally slow to uptake. People still use older versions and don't all upgrade immediately.

Aren't sidechains just colored coins? A colored coin is just a piece of a bitcoin that you can use to represent something else. So theoretically you could take the smallest unit which is a satoshi and there is a way to mark the coin so it becomes "colored" and then it can be traceable and be used to represent something else that you make up.... a stock for instance.  I am not sure what the smallest unit a colored coin can be though it might need to be larger than 1 satoshi.

Your choices: wait and do nothing, convert all to USD and withdrawal (long queues possible for USD), convert all to bitcoin and sign up to bitcoinbuilder and trade for real btc at a loss but you get real btc. You could also try gaming the market on gox by selling for fiat and hoping it crashes and buying lower. If you do that you can then use bitcoinbuilder to trade out without losses if you are really lucky.

Money is a tool. It can be used to do good things (like donate to charity) ... or bad things (like buy something illegal). Bitcoin is a form of money and therefore these qualities also apply to it. Criminals (and the rest of the world) tend to prefer to use the best tool for the job. For instance the car is a better tool for transportation than bikes are. Criminals use cars. Should we have not allowed technology to progress past bicycles because one day cars could be used to help bank robbers escape for instance? The same reasoning applies to all technology. You can't stop progress because it's better than what was before it........... even if some criminal element will want to use it (because it's better!) .

He STILL does not get it. If other exchanges (Kraken, Coinjar, Coinsetter, Coinkite , vault of satoshi etc) all WORK and have correctly implemented wallet software and don't NEED some change inside the bitcoin software to function then it's a sign that Mt. Goxs software is shit and could be fixed like all the other exchanges. It's proof. His comments are worrying because they still don't seem to get it and he says something like this "We have proposed a solution that would allow people sending bitcoins to track sent coins no matter what happens in terms of malleability (a solution that can be applied quickly and without breaking anything), and the Bitcoin developers are preparing ways to prevent modified transactions from being relayed by the network (which will take a lot of time and may break some bitcoin custom clients).

One way that I have seen before is that someone uses a paper wallet... then they get some wallet software and retrieve the paper wallet key and transfer some of the bitcoins. They mistakenly believe that the remainder balance (what they don't transferL) is still on the paper wallet but that is not how it works. The wallet software will spend all the funds and basically refund itself back what you don't spend and nothing will be left on the paper wallet. But then the user will delete the wallet software and keep the paper thinking it is still good

what I want to know is how can bookkeeping be shoddy? isn't it Incredibly easy? For instance........ if you run an exchange shouldn't it be just one single command to give you how many bitcoin your customers *should* have... and then all you need is a watching only wallet for your cold storage. If the two don't match then something is wrong. How simple is that?

I think bitcoin is  a nobrainer for most merchants to accept. It virtually eliminates fraud. It lowers processing costs. But there may be a reason why amazon in particular might not like bitcoin. At least in my opinion. Here is why...... for years I have used amazon because I don't like putting my payment info all over the place. Part of it is putting in all the info... and part of it is creating and registering a new account with every merchant. If I saw an item on  with some merchant and the same item at amazon I would buy the amazon one even if it was a little bit more expensive because it is just convenient. What happens with bitcoin? This convenience factor is eliminated. It becomes as easy to buy on any site without any account. With the exception that you would still need to input some email and shipping info.

Charlie Shrem holds a small amount of btc on gox. He did not ask about solvency and doesn't have any concrete details. He didn't talk on the phone with mark. He doesn't believe gox is a "scam" and has hopes that they will come through.
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:41:36
nah. a gag order doesn't give him a reason to do the things he has been doing. Look at when he changed the sourcecode for the mtgox page for instance and put "acq goes here" . That's misleading. It means he is either some kind of manipulator or he is completely delusional in thinking someone would actually acquire his company that is missing so many bitoins that it would be delusional to think they would. Letting trading continue to crash the price of bitcoin on his own exchange down to 100 dollars and then doing arbitrage is not something someone honest would do and a gag order doesn't make that suddenly okay. He is giving out false and conflicting messages.

No. It would destroy fungibility if the bitcoin community let something like that happen and it would destroy bitcoin itself.

Now it is stuck in some refund process

Buttercoin looks interesting... I wish more details were given about it. On a side note is he really a reddit cofounder? If so I have a suggestion. I have read that reddit does not get much revenue. One way to increase revenue would be to enable bitcoin tip bot in every subreddit. The reason is because bitcoin can also be used to purchase reddit gold and that would be a perfect thing to use for tips but currently....... tip isn't enabled in enough places. In other words if you enable bitcoin tipping throughout reddit more tips will get spread around and in turn more reddit gold will be purchased.

if you bought a house with bitcoins why wouldn't you have to pay property tax? How do you get around that? If you purchase some item with bitcoin how do you get around the merchant charging a sales tax? The merchant will do what the law requires in order to stay in business.  If you are paid in bitcoin how do you get around the employer not reporting your income for income tax? they would still be required to.  The only real tax that bitcoin makes easy to avoid is estate taxes.

whats crazy to me is that if you sold coins on gox at like 360 and buy back right now at 170 you could get 2.11 times as many coins and then if you traded "gox coins" for real coins at .5 you would still come out further ahead than if you weren't using gox at all

I understand some places have to comply but shouldn't compliance be related to the amounts being transacted? if it is 20 dollars how serious is it?

I see this theory put forth a lot and while it is possible I think gox said they are "not allowed to do this" before. Also if they were buying up cheap coins then why is the price still so low? No I think the reason the price of coins on gox is so cheap is because of lack of confidence from investors there but also because people are afraid to send money to gox to buy them because they fear that money will be lost from insolvency or won't get there fast enough to buy them and will be stuck on the exchange for months

a bitcoin email system would be great. I think the micro-fee should be returned to the sender if you respond to their email. That way you could have higher micro-fees and it would result in even less spam. Also facebook has been testing out the ability to message celebrities by paying money. What you could do with a bitcoin email system is *you* the owner of your email address could personally decide what your minimum fee is. So if you are a celebrity you could say .005 bitcoins or something. Then if you message that celebrity they get the .005 (Unless they reply back to you in which case it gets returned to you) .

Thanks for spelling it out better. Not only was bitstamp not putting out malformed transactions there also has to be the failure that they would give automatic refunds.

I'm not sure it is really worth the time because if someone is truly interested in bitcoin they will figure out what the complex words mean.

it should lower the price some ... however there are some key things to consider. Some people immediately buy back coins after spending them. Some people. Some people would have sold bitcoins anyway had there not been an item available on overstock so they would have gotten cash to buy it through another method. And finally ... it might be that it is pretty enticing to buy bitcoins back after spending them if the price drops because you could potentially buy back the same amount of bitcoins that you originally had..... so a dropping price would be even more of an incentive to buy back in. It's hard to say though. One thing thing is for sure........... the first day(s) will be the busiest in terms of bitcoin transactions there so it should gradually get less till it stabilizes qat some point lower than the initial announcement.

You would have done better mining some alt coin probably then trading for btc. I would stay far far away from mining. With mining you are limiting your upside a lot and you aren't limiting your downside. If btc fails you go bust. If it succeeds you make just a little.  Just buy actual btc

The thing about ripple is that it benefits bitcoin.Any ripple gateway automatically accepts bitcoin. XRP doesn't really compete with bitcoin because nobody would put serious money into it since the value is pretty much controlled by them. They can change how much transactions costs (the size of a drop) and they also have a large amount of xrp for themselves (like a stock) so you won't see xrp become gold 2.0. Additionally I don't think your xrp are saved offline so they aren't entirely in your control (I think? correct me on that)

As others have mentioned.... just return the same dollar value in bitcoins. If they end up getting less bitcoins back it is not a big deal because they were willing to part with the bitcoins in the first place. Also they won't be angry because you are a store they can spend at and that is a good thing.
An additional point... you can avoid having an account on an exchange by doing this: When someone asks for a return you wait for someone to buy something (with bitcoin) and don't convert those bitcoins to dollars. Reroute them to the refund. You save the coinbase 1% fee and don't need an exchange.

it's probably a good idea to think long term. that means 2+ years at least. The next reward halving will be in 2016 so if you can wait 6 years you will hit 2 reward halvings. Also as a piece of advice if you keep your coins on an exchange you will be tempted to panic sell them. Also instead of going all in at once i'd go half in and then wait 1-3 months to see if the price will go down and buy if it does. we are instinctually fooled when it comes to investing because we want to buy into strength when really we should buy into weakness

what I think is at this point in time bitcoin *probably* isn't better for you than 5-7% . Some of it depends on how much money you are moving. If it's a million dollars then you have to go on to some exchange and buy a million worth. The problem with that is that there is a difference between the lowest ask and the highest bids and the more money you are talking about the greater the difference is. (not including the small percent exchanges usually take) .  At this point in time I don't think there are enough bitcoin exchanges with deep enough markets to move money so cheaply. if you catch an uptrend you could actually make money though instead of pay fees. If you catch a downtrend you could lose money. Also as some others have said you might have problems with money appearing from nowhere into your bank account.

I would be personally willing to be paid partially in bitcoins as part of my income. If you are paid in dollars ....... and you are the kind of person that has more than 1 thousand dollars in your bank ... and that is true for a period of years then you are losing massively due to inflation. Inflation of USD is 9 %. If you keep 10 thousand dollars in your bank for 5 years that is a huge loss in purchasing power. If you don't spend every single penny that you earn then bitcoin could prove to be a good alternative.
@_date: 2014-01-18 08:11:48
A whole list of reasons. Micropayments is just one application.  You don't "have to trust" anyone. You can keep your wealth entirely in your possession. While it is true that you could avoid "bail-in" type situations with dollars if you stored cash under your bed... it isn't very practical. And plus even if you do store dollars under your bed they aren't safe from confiscation since in essence they can be taken from you through the printing of more dollars.
Security is a matter of trade-offs. You could divide your bitcoins into several wallets... and then you could divide the private keys of those wallets into requiring several pieces and you could put them in safes spread out in different geographical locations. But if you want some spending money it might be a good idea to have less security for the sake of being able to spend it. It doesn't mean you have to put ALL your money on a hot wallet.

It's not. People just have unrealistic expectations. You can't just bring a bitcoin atm without complying with anything and expect the government to not react. They react to the smallest of things. They confiscated millions of dollars from Mt. GOX and their dwolla connection even though mt gox was already complying with KYC laws. I am actually going to guess the opposite of this guy... Robocoin will thrive because other atm's won't take identity verification as far so they will get sideswiped by the governments local and federal. The governments will come in and just steal the machines and all the cash in them if they can come up with any small reason. Sometimes, like trees, it is better to bend a little because it makes you stronger and less brittle.

One thing that you might want to point out is that there are already intermediaries out there that allow someone with bitcoin to go to a site and the site basically arranges the shipping for them and thus allows them to spend bitcoin at UPS.

Personally I would pick an amount I would be willing to invest and buy with half that amount and save the other half for a lower price target in case of a crash. That way if it only goes up from here.... well you did good. And if it goes down well you got more than you would have had and you help to protect the price somewhat. It might even be a good idea to keep money on an actual exchange with bids in for like 25-50% dips to catch them. In a few months it will be a lot "safer" I think to invest because we will know what the US regulations are going to actually be but by then if it's good news then you want to be in......

1. The consumer would pay the transaction fee to get the coins from their wallet to the address that mcdonalds provides. IF mcdonalds uses coinbase instead of bitpay and IF the customers wallet is already on coinbase then there isn't any transaction fee at all.
2. The wallet you use usually has a set default transaction fee that you can modify. 
3. Transactions are designed to be scarce. In the future.... far into the future the transaction fees on the main blockchain will probably not be suitable for microtransaction which means transactions will be taken off the block chain

I think I can take the cake for one of the most regretful decisions. In 2012 I first heard about bitcoin and the price was around $5.50. It was in the fall. I decided to send 2k to mt gox and by the time it arrived the price was down to $2.30 . I bought 1k worth and waited about a week but then sold it for no profit or loss because of frustration. I let the money just sit on gox for another year :/

With the rate that education and healthcare is going up even 100k in 28 years won't do any good.

A mining pool is made up of miners who are there for their own self interest. If the market considers them a risk then the price will drop and they will lose income. They have every incentive to not piss the market off. Secondly... Even if a mining pool started to try a 51% attack all it could really do is start double spending. It isn't enough power to go back and rewrite the blockchain to change what happened in the past. And finally... even if a mining pool was starting to act in a bad manner there are counters to this..... miners, devs, and full nodes would see this and they could negate them entirely from doing any harm.

it's possible that the exploits only happened recently and for smaller amounts than we might imagine. If mt gox itself didn't know why their transactions were failing more frequently (too many leading zeroes) then it might have taken hackers a while to catch on. At least that is what I am hoping.

As far as paper wallets... I heard one problem people have is that they import their paper wallet into another wallet and spend some amount then delete the temporary wallet thinking that the original amount is still back on the paper wallet without realizing that the temporary wallet created a change address that is now lost.

If this really goes through you have to hand it to the winklevi... they not only had the idea and follow-through for the ETF but they *bought the entire amount of 100k bitcoin* before going forward with it. They probably spent what? a couple million. If I remember they bought in a little after me so about 15$ a coin say. That is a measly 1.5 million they paid for their coins. And it is already worth over 100 million. And if the ETF actually gets approved you can bet that 100 million will be closer to half a billion. Off of a measly 1.5 million investment.

While I would personally like to see segwit and then schnorr signatures I can see why a hard fork is appealing to some people. The problem is that a hard fork is necessary to combat high fees and drive off users and if you make some self imposed requirement that it has to be year(s) in advance then it makes sense to put a flag day in ahead of time.

if that is the case I wonder how they came up with the figure of schnorr adding 40% capacity. That seems like a lowball estimate. Every single user could alter their behavior if such a thing was available. Exchanges would be helped the most obviously but if you wanted to for instance: Load a physical coin, send money to an exchange, buy something from purse in the same day if you decided to do it all at once you could create essentially 3 transactions in 1

You're right about one thing in a roundabout way. The price will dictate who wins. If nobody wanted to buy coins from a &gt; 1 mb block mined by bitcoin unlimited miners who controlled the hashrate majority then the price would plummet and the miners would abandon it. But you also have to remember what it takes to initiate the fork in the first place which is weeks of greater than 75% hashrate. If the price was going to plummet after the fork then the price would plummet before the fork once people realized that 75% of the hashrate signalled something. Since the price would plummet before the fork if it was not in widespread economic agreement that means that the fork will never happen unless it is in the interests of users and businesses and miners. In other words the market is going to signal what it really wants in the not too distant future so there isn't a point in bickering about it here.

That's true. I agree with that.  But there is also an opposing effect: A larger user base including merchants and regular users has a positive impact . For the sake of argument consider if the blocksize stayed the same: If we had 100 times the users we have now with the same block size would we have more , less nodes, or equal?

corefork would be an altcoin and altcoins get attacked all the time. You can call it morally wrong, but what if it is in the financial interest of the majority fork to make sure there isn't a minority version that confuses people? Regardless... core has members who have attacked alt coins before. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 04:51:19
some core supporters were crying that a hardfork could split the network and is too dangerous. Now they seem to be crying that a miner will not allow the network to split (since a small fork doesn't have much economic backing in terms of miners securing the network). So make up your minds. If you're right about a hard fork being actually contentious then the network won't split into a "small corefork" as the miner predicts. But if you're wrong and corefork is a minority fork similar to eth classic and the miners can stop it then maybe they are doing everyone a favor.

I always suggest pick an amount you are willimg to invest and use half that to buy. If it crashes significantly afterward buy with the other half as well. This keeps you in an emotional win situation which is key because i think most bad trading and monetary loss with bitcoin happens because of weak emotional positions.

I was sarcastic. The 32MB blocks wouldn't immediately fill of course. As a side note I did a rough calculation... if we simply increased the blocksize from 1MB to 10MB and we had the same transaction demand proportionally then miners would be getting slightly more from transaction fees than from the subsidy which means we would basically be entering a phase of self sufficiency almost. That would be exciting.

So being able to support twice as many users during the growth phase is all of the above? Sounds overconfident to me. We are rapidly closing in on greater than 1 dollar average transaction fees.  At that point bitcoin is literally just electronic gold and nothing more. And electronic gold is a great thing..... but there is that little problem of miner funding. By constraining the blocksize so much the amount fees would have to be to make up for the diminishing block reward over time will be enormous (assuming that bitcoin keeps gaining value and doesn't simply lose to another coin that flips its scalability switch on).
I'm pro segwit and I think it is a decent temporary measure.
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:16:38
sure. this guy is basically saying that alt coins will lower the price of bitcoin because holding them would have a greater potential reward. That argument is very problematic though because the only way any reward could come about was if the whole market switched. So that ignores things like first mover advantage. It also ignores that bitcoin itself is more useful because it has a higher price. It also ignores that if the market did switch away from bitcoin that changes the outlook for any alt coin and it therefore wouldn't have the potential upside bitcoin has because if the theory was true then the market would keep switcingh again infinitum until they were using a worthless coin.

Good post as usual. I think people who claim that bitcoin is a ponzi make a giant logical mistake. It goes like this:
All value is determined by the behavior of others. If you assume what the behavior of others will be then with your faulty assumptions you could claim that anything is a "scheme".
 For instance if you assume that the behavior of everyone is that tomorrow nobody will want bitcoin, then every single person that has acquired it will be at a loss for the effort and capital they put into acquiring it. But the same thing goes for literally anything of value. If you bought a Van Goh painting and you assume that the behavior of people will be that in 2 days everyone will hate Van Goh then the person that bought the painting will by appearances be ripped off.
You make a great point in that money itself is just a token that people acquire in the hope of exchanging it later for something of value. The argument against particular tokens such as gold based on faulty assumptions alone aren't real arguments. Saying: "this is worthless because tomorrow it could be worthless" isn't a real argument. Rather, an argument would be stating the case for *why* people would no longer want the token.

I'm not talking about subjective value. If the current block reward is 1800 bitcoins per day and each is worth 1.2k then they earn 2, 160, 000.  If the next block reward is cut in half and you have 900 bitcoins per day and you assume the value compensates by rising to 2.4k each then you still have the same revenue per day (2, 160, 000) except the difference is now you have a bitcoin market worth 2.4k * 16, 800, 000 instead of a bitcoin market worth 1.2k * 16, 800, 000 which means you have the same monetary incentive to secure the network despite the network being worth twice as much. Over time this could cause a problem which is why you still need transaction fees.  And miners could earn more from transaction fees by larger block sizes for the same reason that it is easier to sell 15 one dollar lemonades than it is to sell one ten dollar lemonade. (high price reduces demand).

If all lending must come from savings then how can the money supply possibly grow? I'll give you a hint. It involves lending in excess of savings. If you have a reserve requirement of zero, then you don't need any savings for lending. Additionally where do you think reserves come from originally in the first place? I'll give you another hint.... it's not savings.
@_date: 2015-01-31 04:15:51
Fractional reserve lending is a rule. You can change the reserve ratio and adjust the rule or you can simply not require reserves altogether.
Separating them makes sense since the only reason they aren't separated has to do with greed. Goldsmiths used fractional reserves to increase the amount of interest they could get. That's how fractional reserve came into being. It makes no sense at all to have such an antiquated convoluted system like that today. Except that it benefits certain people.

If someone pays miners it is essentially the same as buying miners themselves. It is quite normal for those who have a larger stake in something to get a larger voice such as in stocks. Anyways it was a mistake to say miners have a vote. They don't really have a vote. They just have signaling.

If you had the ledger wallet for instance you could keep your paper 24 word backup in a safety deposit box and just use your hardware wallet to play with. Maybe spend a little bitcoin, generate new addresses to receive bitcoin. Also if for some reason your backup is destroyed you still have your hardware wallet. If someone steals your hardware wallet the ledger nano S wipes the wallet if they guess the incorrect 4 digit PIN more than 3 times I think.

When I said hashrate I misspoke. I meant monetary incentive towards hashrate. The hashrate itself is irrelevant. What matters security-wise is how much monetary incentive there is for the hashrate. That is determined by miner revenue. It is an open ended question of how much security we need. But the point is you can't deny that simply relying on the value of bitcoin rising alone does not keep the monetary incentive towards hashrate proportional to the value of the bitcoin market.  And the other problem is something you can't deny...in the same way that it would be harder to fill blocks with spam if blocks were bigger (because it would cost more) miners could earn more revenue if blocks were bigger. Whether or not this matters is open for discussion but it is true.

I can't agree that someone who wants the ETF doesn't have bitcoins best interest in mind. If slow and steady was best for bitcoin then by that reasoning the price should have taken 10 years to go from 1 cent to 10 dollars.  A higher evaluation of bitcoin helps bitcoin in numerous ways. It attracts more investors/entrepreneurs. It helps with liquidity. It ultimately gets spread to more and more hands which equates to more users. Sometimes the value just has to jump at a crazy rate because if any asset at all keeps making great gain after gain after gain that has to have a consequence. Bitcoin has been rising since it bottomed at about 200 with a couple mini crashes a long the way. An ETF approval would send the price sky rocketing but hopefully the increased amount of funds available to purchase bitcoin could abate the ensuing crash.
I don't think waiting for a scaling resolution is a good idea. I've been waiting for a scaling resolution for years. I've been asking for a block size increase since about 2012. I'll take segwit. I'll take a block size increase. I'll take the ETF. But waiting for something that may not happen in the near future may not be a good idea. What if for instance the ETF was stalled because of the scaling debate for several more years and the SEC just decided to approve an ethereum ETF because they may even like the idea that the network is mutable rather than immutable (for the same reason they think chargebacks are great for "consumer protection" despite that it screws merchants.)
I also disagree that bitcoin can get to 5k by 2018 without an ETF but that is just my opinion.

It's a matter of revenue. Security is incentivized by miner revenue. How much money do you think miners can make if they are limited to 1 megabyte of transactions per ten minutes? How much more could they make if there was larger than 1 megabyte of transactions per 10 minutes? Obviously the maximum they could make is more with a larger block size therefore the maximum security is also larger.

Andreas claims he isn't pro classic and he isn't pro core, he is pro consensus. That's because he isn't pro bitcoin. He is pro cryptocurrency. He is not heavily invested in the idea that one crypto currency needs to succeed because if one fails another will just rise in its place. The cat is out of the bag so to speak. It "cannot be uninvented".
I like to think that Andreas and Gregory Maxwell are really arch enemies; they just don't realize it yet. Consider a youtube video posted more than a year ago of Andreas standing up in front of some Canadian politicians (I forget their names or the exact event) but he goes on to say towards the end (i'm paraphrasing because I don't remember the exact words) with a vehement sense of righteousness that credit cards are insecure by nature and since arriving in Canada he is already having issues with fraud alerts with his credit card because he is in a different country and that at their very nature pull transactions (credit cards) are not and never will be secure compared to push transactions (bitcoin)
So there he is standing up in front of the Canadian politicians and he makes a case about how bitcoin is superior to credit cards from a security point of view and that is a major reason we need bitcoin despite that "criminals may use it for nefarious purposes". What's the problem? The problem is Gregory Maxwell does not see bitcoin as a competitor to credit cards because "we already have systems for that which do their job well".
Notice the problem? And that's the tip of the iceberg. There is also the whole problem about bitcoin banking the unbanked. With Gregory Maxwell in charge that isn't going to happen when in the future transaction fees cost more than their daily salaries.
The debate over blocksize isn't just some minor quibble. It could actually result in the failure of bitcoin if handled the wrong way. In the long run this may not actually matter since people will still certainly have some form of cryptocurrency. But for investors it should matter.  The lightning network doesn't exist yet... there is no certainty of when it will exist. There is no certainty of whether it will be good enough to actually scale on top of a block size that is too small. And the entire security of the bitcoin network is at stake because when you limit the blocksize you are controlling the funding of miners by your hand and that could actually result in the underfunding of miners because they are not allowed to let the network grow to a greater extent which could result in more money and thus more security. Since the bitcoin reward or subsidy halves every 4 years over time that's an important issue that could result in the downfall of bitcoin.

What is my model exactly? Did you just assume that my model is the opposite of yours and that I am claiming node count goes up with increased users with no exceptions? Obviously if there was an artificial demand for full nodes before from wallet choices and from home miners then some of the data is skewed and it makes it a rather hard calculation to make.

Simpler? No. The simple solution involves less steps which is on chain. Does it make sense to buy coffee with bitcoin? While its young, yes it does.

The behavior of miners is somewhat important because they can choose to include transactions... or not. But a larger block size increases the potential revenue miners can make from transaction fees. For the same exact reason, it could  cost more to fill up blocks if the block size was larger.

The only voting that is not subject to manipulation is hashrate and the market evaluation of bitcoin. People vote with their wallets and miners will vote with their hashrate. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:21:26
You artificially cap the security of the network by artificially capping the blocksize. Due to the laws of supply/demand you cannot reach the maximum potential revenue towards miners by capping the supply at 1 MB which means the dream of having super valuable bitcoin with only high value transactions is quite the dream because the security of the network needs to support that incredibly high value. The idea of having the value of bitcoin simply rise to compensate for the block reward reducing doesn't account for the  disproportionate amount of security you would have over time. (the hashrate would not stay proportional to the value of bitcoin in that scenario). And this is all assuming that you don't kick people off of the network because of the high fees and push them into something else that can do low and high value transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-05 23:49:02
Except your definition of what is and isn't centralization and how much is enough is subjective so none of that is going to help is it?
There is a real problem of constricting bitcoin to the point that it pushes users away. It's a serious problem because the future security of the network depends on those users. You're not going to find people paying 30, 40, or 50 dollars or even 200 dollars to make a transaction. You need a large amount of transactions with relatively cheap fees and you need it relatively soon. In a little over 8 years the block reward will only be about 3 bitcoins.

I agree. The ability to hard fork in the event of a hostile takeover and change consensus rules is a defense mechanism. Andreas even said this before in one of his videos. What happens when a nation state tries a 51% attack? We change the Proof of work so their hardware becomes useless. They can still mine on their fork but without users it won't matter. Changing the proof of work is creating an alternative client. That is what bitcoin classic is. Changing a consensus parameter because there has been a hostile takeover (Of core devs not budging on block size).

You're creating imaginary arguments and also conflating others. BU doesn't contain anything called "emergent consensus". BU doesn't equal a larger blocksize limit.

Since it turns out that many of the developers aren't really trustworthy people this makes sense.

Overall not a bad chart but it does seem full of errors. I'm pro BOTH. For SEGWIT: Criticism: more software has to be rewritten than vs a blocksize increase, some people don't like the discount on signature heavy transactions (Seems good to me since signature heavy transactions allow cool things), cannot be rolled back and will fork the network if you do (I think), may not be as elegant as "flexibile transactions" but no developers are interested in FT. Benefits: Has a lot more coders looking at the code than BU
(btw it is more Flexibile transactions vs segwit than BU vs segwit since neither are actually scaling solutions)
BU unlimited: the hard fork related "criticism" I fear is overblown. The ethereum network hard forked in a matter of hours. The hard fork for bitcoin could be integrated months in advance. The hard fork for ethereum was done for immutability reasons which is a lot worse. Not to mention that the market cap of Ethereum is now basically what it was before the fork anyway which considering that it was in a bubble phase isn't that bad. Miners don't have more control. that is a myth.

I wouldn't call coinbase an exchange exactly. It isn't a normal one. It allows you to buy bitcoins quickly because they use their money to buy it while they wait for your money to arrive. A typical exchange is much better to use unless you are in a hurry. itbit or gemini would charge much lower rates, but again your money will take time to arrive. If everyone is simply planning on "waiting and seeing" then the proper strategy would be to wire money to an exchange in advance. Relying on coinbase could prove futile because they will run out of funds if an ETF is approved (guessing).

Segwit is more of a scaling nightmare than a scaling solution. It might handle other things like malleability, but for scaling it is probably worse than doing nothing. The attack vector with Segwit in place means that in the future you will not be able to raise the block size as much, because instead of there being a 1:1 vector it's more like 1:4. If you raise the block size to 2 MB then your network needs to handle 8 MB for the worst case scenario.
edit: I would say that extra pruning allowed by excluding segwit data would help scalability, but I'm pretty sure that the small blockist people don't count pruned nodes as full nodes anyway so it's a moot point.

The current scaling argument is "binary" because one side is unwilling to compromise. Some of the core devs have a radical and flawed view of what decentralization is and how it benefits users. Consider Satoshi for example. He knew what decentralization was and the value of it since he invented bitcoin. Yet his view for scaling was that everyone doesn't need to run a full node. Here is a recent [link]( from Mike Hearn linking to satoshi


for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.
This is a radically different view from the current core developers who scream decentralization like Hillary Clinton screams 9/11. also has pointed out that they won't define exactly how much decentralization is enough... because it is subjective. You get certain benefits from decentralization but those benefits have diminishing returns. Data replication for instance... what does it matter if your data is replicated 10 thousand times or 12 thousand? Certainly not as much as the move from 0 to 2 thousand. They (core devs) are quick to point out how node count is falling. Yet there was previously an artificially high demand for running a node. Most wallets were full nodes. Myself, I used to run armory. It was a full node and it had very useful features such as the ability to spend your funds by signing a transaction on a USB stick so that your cold wallet was untouchable but also could be spent from.  The armory program itself, however, is somewhat buggy and the core developers haven't really been active. I have since moved to Ledger wallet.
Consider Gavin Andresen's recent [comment](


I've never understood the full node fetish; there are hand-wavy arguments that we need everybody to run a full node 'for security' or 'in case of government crackdown' but as long as we have a dozen or three full nodes in a dozen or three countries the network will be nice and secure and robust from a number-of-full-nodes perspective 
This is not some guy who, as jensuth implied is "common man's militant idiocy" for disagreeing with the core developers. This is the guy that satoshi handed the commit keys to who later gave them up so he could focus on thinking about scaling solutions. (I believe IBLT was his idea) .
Another example of how their view of decentralization is flawed is by a recent post on the dev list by Christ Priest. The core devs consider a mining pool as a single entity. That's a problem because if you define decentralization that way it becomes useless since mining pools are made up of several entities. [hashingpower liquidity]( . By their own definitions, bitcoin is already in fail-mode and anything that contributes to their definitions is not going to be used because it will contribute to the failure. The base layer (bitcoin) can't scale under the current lead developers.
One thing I have seen a few of the developers cite is s work on doing block propagation tests. They claim since we can only handle 2 megabytes now, that developing seg witness for the time being is all we need for scaling because it adds to the amount of transactions that can be stored in blocks. Problem? It doesn't reduce the amount of information full nodes have to store. It doesn't provide the same returns as a simple block size increase would. (It gives 1.75mb of usable block space far into the future assuming 100% adoption) with an attack vector of blocks 4MB in size. Whereas a simple block size increase would give 2 MB of space and only a 2MB attack vector, and it would be simpler to code and deploy. Another thing worth mentioning is that jtoomim qualifies his tests by saying that it was done without beneficial things in place such as using the relay network...something seemingly glossed over by core devs.
Lastly, decentralization. You could have the most decentralized, most secure network, but if only 2 people used it then it isn't very useful. A money is more useful the more users it has. The bitcoin network can't decentralize past its own userbase. If it artificially restricts that portion then it actually hurts security. Governments are less willing to meddle in something that most people use rather than few people use. Nodes are more likely to be deployed with more people using bitcoin rather than less. The price of bitcoin will most likely be higher the more people use it rather than fewer.

BU solves a problem that core developers have been proclaiming about for ages... that if we hard fork the blocksize (in other software circles known as an "upgrade") we will be incompatible and kick nodes off the network. If more people used BU software that wouldn't hold true anymore.

Reasonable. But one side is incapable of compromise it seems. A block size fork followed by  seg witness makes more sense for many reasons. One is that seg witness only increases capacity if people actually use it. The time that could take could be on the order of years.

just a couple ideas: What about integrating with changetip somehow and using them to tip people by simply requesting their email. They could then retrieve their tip or leave it with changetip to tip someone else. This saves you from paying multiple transaction fees (or them) which would cut into the benefits of such small amounts.
Or pooling all the 1% together and awarding some kind of lottery to the 1000th customer or something.

From the year 2036 to 2037 the price of storing the blockchain goes up 19.1k in his calculations. Using CURRENT costs of storage that means each block would be:( 6 X 24 X 365) 52,560 blocks a year @ .019 $ per GB. 19,100 / .019 = 1,005,263 GB a year. 1,005,263 / 52,560 = 19 GB a block  which is bigger than even Bitcoin XT would have been in 2037

1.  Bitcoin was announced to the public before it started. You might want to mention that it solved a computing problem that hadn't up until that point been solved as neatly so it is a genuine "invention". Bitcoin is a technology and the currency is just one app. The early adopters do increase their wealth unless they sold. How do you know they haven't sold? And if they haven't sold.... why didn't they sell when their wealth was so much? Maybe it's because they actually believe in what it's capable of. If they haven't sold yet and they are an early adopter then you could say they are risking a lot by staying in. Every day they stay in is more risk..... and risk deserves reward if it turns out to be right. Just like any investment.
2. Increasing the supply from 21 million would require a hard fork. The majority of people would not follow a hard fork that destroyed the idea and value of their own holdings because people are selfish in nature. Therefore you can safely assume that is one thing that won't happen.
3. if someone wants to buy a lot of bitcoin and they do it too fast they will create a bubble and that will inevitably mean they will lose money. It's not profitable. Furthermore for the record WB doesn't like bitcoin because he thinks it is like gold and he doesn't like gold. The truth is that bitcoin is much more useful than gold.
4. There has never been anything that has grown just 1000%? Keep in mind that bitcoin is far beyond that. It's over 5 years old now and every year it has gained quite admirably.  Bitcoin is still a risky investment but if it turns out to win the cryptocurrency war and governments, banks, ISPS, and patent trolls don't destroy it then it could rise a lot more in value and stay high in value because it is actually even more useful the more valuable it is.

I think what core has planned all along is what I said over a month ago: Core seeks to skirt along the lowest block size limit they can get away with. They will not announce a hard fork for an increased block size limit. Rather they will delay and if a fork actually starts and looks like it's succeeding they will then initiate some kind of fork,  hard or soft as long as it's within their "reasonable limits" of technological capacity (which right now 2MB would be). The problem with that is damage will already be done. Fees/backlogs will already have risen to a level and stayed there, pushing out users and use cases. The **uncertainty** will have already slowed investment down from companies who would have otherwise wanted to use the blockchain but were not sure it could handle the capacity.

occasionally will say something interesting. Here you [go](
It is an interesting explanation, but I'm not sure it is adequate. Isn't the amount of precision that 21 with another 6 zeroes before the decimal place and then another 8 zeroes after the same amount of precision as 210 with another 6 zeroes after the decimal and 7 zeroes after? it is still the same amount of digits. (unless I got something wrong which I probably did considering jstolfi is some kind of computer science teacher). 
My own personal guess is that it has to do with the deflationary aspect. If you are releasing "500" bitcoins at a time in the beginning it might seem too unfair by later adopters when they simply look at the number.  Instead he chose a small number that was capable of huge value (because more units are to the right of the decimal than to the left)

I think people are misunderstanding this. You can run the entire bitcoin network with a single laptop. Improvements in computer speed according to Moore's law isn't necessary because hashing power only matters in relation to other peoples hashing power. The technological improvement in bitcoin asic technology could stall right now and it wouldn't matter so long as the stall applied to everyone. What matters more is storage space for nodes, but so far everything seems fine considering that you can have 2 entire bitcoin blockchains on a modern phone (100+ GB storage).

If every theoretical problem that comes with a hard fork is conflated with BU then you are spreading misinformation. Are there potential problems to hard forks ? Sure. But make a distinction between hard forks and BU otherwise you are just arguing against a hard fork which BU isn't.
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:58:09
i'd be more inclined to guess that a greater than a minority part of the ecosystem feels disenfranchised because they think that with the status quo leadership there will be no block size increase *ever* despite actual technological and software advances. For instance... the arbitrary argument that some use that a hard fork must take a year of planning... if a hard fork was ever actually meant to occur they could have included the code with segwit and had it activate 1 year after segwit and it would have satisfied that imaginary argument. Except they didn't. There seems to be a clear intention to not increase the blocksize ever. That means the market has to go around them.
My own opinion is that we should err on the side of smaller(but obviously larger than we have now) and the best way to do that would actually be to offer some sort of compromise (which they seem incapable of).
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:35:46
You can fabricate things all you want such as "economic majority wants this or that". There was recently a poll placed that is not gameable because it requires signatures of bitcoin holders to actually verify the vote. So far over 22 million is for BU and I haven't even voted with my ~half million yet. Hopefully the economic majority doesn't want the fees to increase much further than they have lately which can impact the networking effect of bitcoin. They already doubled in the last month alone. Today also over 33% of the network (over 1/3rd) are already signalling for larger blocks and that only includes 2 from the new pool.

Their withdraw process is very slow but in a good way. Basically you schedule a withdraw and it happens by a certain time the next business day. Gives you time to cancel it if you didn't initiate it or contact them. I think it is because they keep most of their funds in cold wallets so they have to manually do one withdraw per day. IMO more secure than coinbase.

i'd be interested in Segwit support inside of BU since that means that with the recent 40% hash behind BU and the 30% hash behind segwit we would be close to actually getting something done.
I've heard it several times that they "don't want to be forced" on to lightning. Nothing against lightning itself. I have no qualms with lightning, but I do somewhat doubt how much it will actually help scale the amount of users (rather than amount of transactions). I actually have higher hopes for sidechains than lightning network for scaling.
There is a separate argument that segwit is "ugly" code and flexible transactions is nicer, but there is only 1 dev behind flexible transactions and BU and flexible transactions are separate. I could personally go for either since I like the idea of flexible transactions and think if it got more developer input it might amount to something, and I think the fear against segwit being ugly soft fork code to be overblown.
@_date: 2016-03-13 14:35:58
I was under the impression that the reasons for disagreement were because of subjective opinions. Both sides are aware that technical scaling issues can be resolved, but the difference is that even if those issues are resolved: The small block side has a different definition and requirements of node decentralization. They (like gregory maxwell) have a different opinion on how miners are best funded; with huge transaction fees rather than more smaller ones. So it's an economic opinion and also a political opinion.  Almost the entire blocksize debate can be summed up in one of gavins posts on reddit from months ago. I forget exactly but it goes like:
"if the network has many millions of users with tens of thousands of full nodes I consider that a decentralization success.

As a miner, what is your opinion on having some transactions become cheaper than others? (Seg wit transactions becoming cheaper than normal ones because the size of the transaction is reduced since part of it is stored outside of blocks) ?

Since when? core can coexist with BU. Even if the block size increased core could remain compatible with the network.


That is a bit dramatic. For the umpteenth time, BU doesn't change much at all. It gives node the ability to change the maximum blocksize it will accept through a *setting* . Core nodes have that same ability through *compiling* .  BU nodes have a setting called accept depth that  allows them to choose a prerequisite amount of invalid blocks before becoming valid. This allows it to follow consensus *passively* rather than actively, but it can still change the value and become "actively" for or against. Core on the other hand is incapable of following consensus passively (it has no accept depth feature) but it can still do it actively (recompiling again). Miners can already change their block size by compiling, whereas BU miners can do it through a setting. 
If the difference between whether bitcoin works or not is based on features that can be changed through a setting rather than by simply compiling software then you have discovered a new fundamental flaw of bitcoin that was always present. And yet it still works.
@_date: 2016-01-09 03:09:58


Well you are both miners so I would value both of your opinions, but is it possible you misread my post? I put the words "block size" hard fork, not "seg wit" hard fork because I was going on a scalability tangent.

Then what you're actually saying is if bitcoin ever hard forks beyond 1 MB then it is actually no longer bitcoin but an altcoin. But that isn't a good definition is it? Bitcoin is what the community wants it to be and miners are simply followers of the community since they follow the price and the community is represented by the price. The 100 million dollars boast is a bluff anyway. Nobody is going to spend 100 million dollars on a vendetta and you wouldn't really achieve anything by blocking corefork.

This is pretty much proven wrong by recent events. Look at how the ethereum hard fork happened in a matter of hours over contentious reasons and how its market cap is now larger than before.

Mechanism? BU allows a node to change the maximum blocksize it will accept as a setting. Bitcoin core allows it as well, as any software does through recompiling. Do you really need to study something so simple? It means that less nodes will get kicked off the network after the block size is increased because they won't have to recompile their software. If you plan to never hard fork upgrade then it is an unnecessary feature. But if you plan to hard fork it is actually better than the default core client.
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:10:45

Miners do what is financially incentive to them. That is the whole point. At what point does a HF become financially incentive? When the benefits outweigh the risks.

pretty sure he said something over 90% of his worth is in BTC. He is trying to increase the value of bitcoin because a larger block size can handle more users and more users can mean greater value. What is so complicated about that? You on the other hand don't seem to care about the price of bitcoin and seem to think that it should be some kind of doomsday prep coin. Bitcoin worked fine for silk road when it was worth a couple of dollars which means that you don't need a high value coin for a doomsday prep purpose (Like silkroad) which means that it is better to steer bitcoin towards a high value purpose than a purely doomsday purpose.
@_date: 2017-01-28 01:11:04
This is wrong for several reasons. Where to start? 


Actually the 95% trigger in segwit is self imposed. It isn't necessary to impose a change on the network. For that you only need &gt; 50%


this isn't true. It isn't true at all. You are making giant leaping assumptions here. You see what people follow is the price. If bitcoin "doesn't" change and it is unable to scale then there is a consequential price reaction that is inevitable from that. So the question isn't "can bitcoin change" . It is "can bitcoin change before it is too late?" Because if the price drastically changes (which is what would happen if bitcoin "doesn't change") then change is inevitable. The assumption you are making is that with no change bitcoin can retain a high value. That is quite the assumption and it is one I don't believe in even though I have 90%+ net worth invested in bitcoin for the last 4 years.
There is currently no real monopoly in bitcoin. It is essentially still a free market. Problems tend to fix themselves in free markets. As the price rises... every iota of fee increase puts additional pressure for "change". Bitcoin will fix itself through free market principles and it will be either because blockstream will eventually resort to actually compromising or be because blockstream is no longer relevant.
I'm of the opinion that we should try to keep the blocksize small(er), but trying to hinder it now to teach everyone a lesson that we shouldn't expect fees to become higher is nonsense. Trying to restrict things now during the early *early* growth phase is insane to me. I have a hard time believing anyone that wants this has any % of their net worth in bitcoin.
The core traits of bitcoin that are resistant to change like the supply limit are hard to change because it is in *everyone's* self interest for it to remain so. To compare this to the blocksize where there is a clear divide in the community and especially people who profit from smaller blocksizes such as alt coiners, sidechain companies ETC... shows that you don't realize how close we are to actually changing that. If something is resistant to change in bitcoin it is because it is in nearly everyone self interest and if it is in nearly everyone's self interest then you wouldn't see such a large divide as we are seeing.

I don't disagree. That is just another way of saying hard fork lol. 
He did screw up as far as Mt. Gox goes but I don't think it was because he knew anything. It is also part of the reason why I bet wrong on bitcoinbuilder so I am not unbiased when I say that.
If you cared about the price and also cared about decentralization then you should have come up with some form of compromise by now to make you and a few other core developers stay relevant... but it won't remain that way if transaction fees start rising too high. That is my prediction anyway. The problem seems to be that you are terrified bitcoin has a tragedy of the commons problem and your strategy of trying to keep the blocksize as small as possible is a losing one. Trees are stronger because they can bend a little, not because they can't. Core would be strong if you bent a LITTLE.
@_date: 2017-01-28 19:12:00

Interesting take on it. I have theorized that this pressure will incentivize scaling in some form. 
If segwit offers a discount on transactions Does that mean that miners will actually be incentivized to scale short term through segwit rather than a hard fork? If it was a hard fork increase it is much easier to visualize an increase in revenue. But if segwit works by discounting the signature data size of transactions doesn't that mean miners revenue won't actually increase since they are still holding the same amount of data (1MB) in their blocks and fees are based on data size? In other words my theory was that miners would be incentivized for segwit not because of an increase in revenue from transaction fees (since they are still only charging fees for 1mb of data) but rather from a perceived increase in value from the activation of segwit as may be shown on the litecoin network.

Layer two solutions are inevitable. The problem small blockers have is stalling growth during the growth phase. The block size has to be raised eventually whether or not you use layer two. Raising it now adds users and therefore more networking effect at a crucial time. Trying to force users off to layer 2 now when it doesn't even exist yet isn't a good strategy.

The only think I can think of that could get segwit activated is if there were some kind of compromise for a hard 2MB fork in addition (which would effectively allow a max 8 block), but that "compromise" might alienate a certain % of hashrate as well so I really can't understand what is going to happen.

I'm pretty sure routing is already figured out and it's called the ripple network. That is how it got the name. When a debt or credit is incurred all of the possible connecting debts and credits are balanced in a way that "ripples" across the network. Of course ripple does it in a way that lightning probably can't do because it has the ability to use IOU's which creates elasticity.

Truth is if you have  "cheaper" coins like litecoin to transact with why would you keep your money in a more expensive coin and constantly pay fees to enter the cheaper coin so that you could keep the bulk of your worth in the more expensive coin?

Another use: increasing chances of genetic survival.
If one of the goals of birth/procreation is to pass on genes this is  something you can only control or influence in the short term. What can you do about your offspring say 100 years into the future? Well now with bitcoin you can timelock transactions and have sent bitcoin only be available after a certain amount of time. If you can control the inheritance of your bitcoin now 200 years into the future then you might be able to help their survival by providing possibly great wealth. The flaw is that it would require some kind of lawyer or Will to pass on the required bitcoin keys and to also not divide the wealth too thin between too many offspring.

You admitted you would leave bitcoin development if blocksize grew too much (Or something of that nature). Relevant doesn't mean fame. It just means being involved.

hmm i'm not a tax expert or anything but I'm going to have to disagree. When I used bitcoin builder I essentially sold bitcoin for a different type of asset. Since the sale of bitcoin is a taxable event then that must mean I must use the value at the time of selling. (It doesn't matter that I sold it for a different asset rather than dollars as buying a house with bitcoin would be the same) . Once the other asset lost value because of insolvency and I traded back for bitcoin that was also a taxable event (a loss). If that isn't the case then I should be able to buy a house with bitcoin and not pay any gains if we are using my "cost basis"  .
edit: DIdn't read the entire comment before replying. Yeah I can substantiate this loss because bitcoinbuilder keeps meticulous records that are still available.

The market deciding is the fork, otherwise you don't actually know what the market wants. Miner hashrate is the market because while mining itself is only a part of the ecosystem they have the greatest incentive to cater to the "market" because their decisions affect the price which directly affects their profits. If you disagree with this then you disagree with bitcoin itself because bitcoin only works according to the self interest of the participants. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 06:27:00
it's a short term gain and a long term reduction. In the short term segwit will allow more transactions, but long term it is a reduction because of the asymmetric nature of how it allows 4X as many transactions in certain scenarios but 2X as many in typical usage. That means that any block increase in the future will suffer from attack vectors greater than the actual increase whereas a simple block size increase wouldn't.
@_date: 2016-12-02 06:51:47
yes I understand. Bitcoin builder was actually a type of trading called "distressed exchange" or some term like that but it was a different asset. I did actually lose 4 bitcoin on mt gox as well and if I was going to claim that as a loss I would use the value of bitcoin on the last day a withdrawl was ever processed on mtgox (because after that they were essentially "lost" and inaccessible). But the loss on bitcoin builder amounts to around 120k . It's probably worthwhile for me to go back. If I understand things right the 120k is basically a loss like a "negative income" so if I have a positive income in 2014 and the 120k loss would offset it and I could claim up to 3k (and I heard that this loss carries over for 15 years or something) . Hmmm
@_date: 2016-12-02 07:11:02
interesting thanks. Sounds like the 4 bitcoins is a wash then. I only became interested in declaring the loss when the IRS started becoming interested in gains. I have no gains in 2014 and I claimed some in 2015 and paid taxes. 2013 is a different story but I heard they are only going back 2 years on coinbase in the news. Although if I did claim such a loss in 2014 that probably triggers some audit that automatically goes back. I'll speak with an accountant

The entire bitcoin network is essentially being run by a single miner at any given point in time since every block of transactions are created by just one miner. When you consider that the entire network is being run by one computer , there isn't a question of whether we need to be able to scale up the block size to accomodate increases in the capacity of modern computers.

The flaws bitcoin has aren't really it's fault. It takes understanding and responsibility to use it. That will scare people away, but when it comes to money people are willing to do go to great lengths if it means saving money or having some sort of monetary freedom. Bitcoin has the potential to be really powerful and to do all these interesting things. It's a protocol for money after all. The problem is that as soon as people actually realize this and start using it....... say for instance to escape capital controls. Do you think governments will just sit idly by? Governments can really hamper the spread of bitcoin because of their powers. So I don't see bitcoin as being hugely influential in the future but it can still have it's niche markets.
@_date: 2015-08-07 05:35:54
This is a similar point to what I was going to say about this.... I think part of the reason we are seeing this is from pure ignorance. What value does a company have in having it's own distributed ledger inside it's own organization? Why not centralize if that is the case? The value in bitcoin comes from the decentralization but the reason that is valuable is because it doesn't require trust and also because no company or central authority is in control of it (and also reselience).

There are several reasons to own guns besides killing people. Just look at the amount of guns that exist, and the amount of people that are actually killed by guns to see. If guns only purpose was killing people then that ratio would be very even.
There are several other reasons to own guns. Killing animals, as a form of recreation (target practice), but I would say the most common reason to have a gun is as a form of verifiable threat that is used in either an offensive or defensive manner. Laws themselves are a verifiable threat. A law doesn't stop someone from committing a criminal act but it acts as a verifiable threat to someone who would. I think we can all agree that more bad things would happen if murder wasn't illegal.

If you want to put bitcoin into a chokehold wouldnt the most logical thing to do would be to reinforce the idea that it needs a small blocksize despite technological advances; which severely limits the number of users that can utilize this currency that is no longer for the worlds unbanked because of higher transaction fees?
Trying to destroy it by *centralizing" it doesnt work too well because: miners can move to friendlier governments, PoW can be changed and ultimately there will always be a more decentralized coin than the next which can rise to the occasion of government animosity

a lot of the calculations I see involving remittance fall short because of all the loss that takes place.

But as the interview continued it became clear that they want to ignore the demand. It doesn't matter if there is a demand for something if you are in charge of the controls. In my opinion, no government or banking lead mission to attack bitcoin will really be successful until cash is eliminated, because then they will finally have the excuse they need. Right now cash is more anonymous and less controlled than anything else out there and criminals use it worldwide. But the time will come when they do eliminate cash and the american people will not have a choice.... any more than they had a choice when all of the sudden in 1913 an income tax came out of nowhere.

what I think: The value of gold is easier to manipulate than bitcoin. With bitcoin it is not as easy to create fake bitcoins and sell them (although it already happened with mt. gox) . In the future, however, exchanges would be able to offer proof of reserves. This prevents fictitious selling. Also Gold could become less rare with asteroid mining. Also gold is not as useful... it's too hard to trade and divide. Too hard to transport. Too cumbersome to store. And it is also centralized so if you try to actually create a money supply with it you will just get raided and everything will be stolen by the corrupt government agencies for our "safety"

That's the idea. Also the 51% attack really just means you can influence the *current* and *future* bitcoin. Not the past. To rewrite the past you would need to have an unfeasible amount of processing power because you would need to write a valid chain faster that was so fast that it could overtake the bitcoin blockchain which is already many years old. I think that is one reason why satoshi kind of kept bitcoin on the downlow in the beginning couple of years to protect it.

Fees will not rise to 20$ anytime soon and it has nothing to do with blocksize. It has to do with nobody being willing to pay that and moving on to something that suits their needs without price gouging. Even western union is competitive to bitcoin right now with the current transaction fees because of the amount BTM's charge in order to make a profit..
Your calculation is full of a lot of bad assumptions. One of them being that if more people start using bitcoin then the people who currently do transactions now won't want to do them more often because there are more people that accept bitcoin. There is also the case of the reward or subsidy halving, and also there is the possibility of miners over investing into hardware. Also 20 dollars is a nightmare but even 1 dollar would be bad. You could literally snail mail money for cheaper to someone.
And your calculation is wrong. If there are 66 times more users you assume there will be just 66 more transactions which is wrong. But even if there are 66 times more transactions how does that equate to a price of 66 times the current price for the average transaction fee?  The problem with your equation is that 66 times more people *couldn't* pay 20 dollars each because even if they did all their transactions still won't fit in a block.

How long are you looking to be invested? The common idea that you will see with bitcoin is that it's a long term investment. Look at the charts long term. It is steadily growing. It's not dying. If governments don't intervene.. bitcoin will become very important, very powerful, and very expensive. Some estimates of even 10k per bitcoin are a low ball figure for a long term (15 + year) investment. The chances of another coin winning are slim since bitcoin has first mover advantage and anything that is truly wrong with bitcoin or better about something else can simply be assimilated into our code. The only thing that can really stop bitcoin at this point are false flag operations. That's where governments purposefully fund terrorists with money. In this case that money would be bitcoin. They would then use illogical arguments to convince the masses that greater monetary freedom in the form of bitcoin is a bad thing. That's it.

Here's a tip... hacktivists aren't bound by the same NDA's and silence treatment that government organizations are bound by. It would be a simple matter for them to disclose the public address of such a wallet if it were actually real so that it could suffer the combined scrutiny of a worldwide community ready to jump in and investigate. There is no justifiable reason for them not to. It's easy to make a claim with no real substance so I'll make a counterclaim. These "hacktivists" are just Jamie Dimon and Blythe masters cackling and eating popcorn on a couch somewhere.

Some miners joined pools because they were more profitable. They then left the pools when the hashing % of the pool became a threat so this was reflected in the bitcoin price. Profit is a two sided coin... on the one side you have the efficiencies of mining and the pools and on the other is the price of bitcoin itself. If blacklists were made do you think that miners would be vying for pools that had a little better efficiency percentage if joining those pools and increasing their power also made the price dropped by a large percentage?

It seems to me that people either don't realize this or think it doesn't matter. The purpose of a republic government like the USA is that it is supposed to protect minority rights. Even if people think they have a right to violate someone elses rights, they don't. It seems to me the most basic right of freedom of all is the right to one's own body. If you think back on slavery, if you are forced to pick cotton in a field it is not your mind that is enslaved. You can think evil thoughts against your oppressors. It is your body that is enslaved. Forced to do the bidding of another. The freedom of your body is the most basic right of freedom and it is supposed to be protected by the Bill of rights as an inalienable right. Ironically the Federal government is the one that is supposed to stop even States from abusing this right, but in the US we are seeing the opposite situation where states are now legalizing marijuana and the Federal government is still raiding those states.

AFAIK There is only one use case for RBF (Unless the lightning network depends on it, then there are 2). That case is:


Wallets and people don't magically know the right answer toward paying the fee that will make sure their transaction will get included in a block. I'm skeptical that RBF is really necessary. If you guess too low with RBF you can replace it but your cost will end up being larger than if you just guessed higher in the first place.

That's not true. Bitcoin has useful purposes just like land can have useful purposes.

People like jstolfi are only looking at the value of bitcoin and not its usefulness. Of course earlier adopters were richer.... the deflationary rate was one of the strategies used to encourage adoption in the first place. Without that we would still have cryptocurrency but bitcoin probably wouldn't be king. Sometimes greed is important.

I doubt that UPS and fedex could get lower for small parcels. Mail carriers already deliver to every residence (financed by mail)so taking a few extra small parcels with them as they deliver doesn't really cost them much extra time (whereas if you are simply delivering from a truck many parcels that don't go to every residence the time it costs is more linear). Theres also the advantage that the post office has many more receptacles to deliver to (mail boxes especially mounted ones) that can save significant time for smaller parcels.

There is a huge problem in the US with Jurors and judges letting criminals go in cases of white collar crime because they are unable to understand the actual crime. In this case, the opposite happened, but with the same effect. Instead of the perpetrator being let go he was essentially convicted because of the inability to understand.
He should have tried to word it simply maybe.  Someone (the scammer) bought something from me (bitcoins) and sold something to him (the fake truck) and he hooked our payment details up without either of us knowing about it. He then took off with the bitcoins and he would have taken off with the cash as well if banks transactions weren't reversible... but they are and bitcoin isn't. The truck guy should be taught some lesson at least. He was buying a truck that was too good to be true, didn't verify that it was even real and he was even duped into using a site that wasn't ebay.

This is actually a very interesting article. Very rarely have I EVER heard a banker mention that the piggy bank aspect of a bank and the loaning aspect could be two totally different institutions and everything would still work just fine (as long as you got rid of the self imposed rules of reserve requirements). It's funny how he is quoting that guy as saying that having them combined was an accident of history. I thought it was on purpose to confuse people... because confuse it does. People actually think that when you get a loan it is not new money being created but rather someone elses money. The problem is there is no other mechanism for the money supply to expand so if it wasn't new money then the money supply couldn't expand.
He makes a couple of more interesting comments. Bitcoin is not accepted as payment in taxes so that doesn't give it an anchor. He has a point... when a government accepts a form of money as taxes...  that gives it value (whether it's backed by gold or not). But notice how this negative is not actually bitcoins fault. What if it was accepted as payment in taxes? Then where is the negative viewpoint coming from about it? Because he says "that radical 
monetary philosophy has unnecessarily marred 
the implementation of a revolutionary technology. "
It's an interesting thought experiment he has but I am pretty sure it will not come to reality for a few reasons. The main one is that if the creation of money is separated from piggy banking..... then people who are normally stupid will realize.. "hey this guy is creating money. And he is charging interest for it. And he is not a government worker... and he is inflating it by creating more on purpose, devaluing my fedcoins. That's outrageous! That someone can just create money out of thin air and justify charging interest on it......"

Best cast scenario - bitcoin rallies all the way up to almost 2k by the end of the month before crashing down to 900 and then settling somewhere around the 600 / 700 's for a while until the block size is raised
slightly bullish scenario : up to about 700-800 peak before crashing down to 400's and settling around 330 after that for a few months gradually approaching 400 when halving occurs
bear scenario: I think worst case is we drop to the high 200's again and then have some new stability in the low 300's
note: I've been historically inaccurate. I thought the low would be in the high 300's after the runup in 2013. Instead we dropped below 200 for a moment or two.

The part that bothers me is how they frequently state or imply that private blockchains are the more important innovation.  However,  just one of the benefits of the public blockchain is that with rules governed by math,  economic incentives built in,  you can get rid of the middleman.  Banks aren't necessary anymore. You can still choose to have one,  but now it's a choice and not a requirement.   It's easy to see why they might want to gloss over that fact.  Decentralization is inefficient but also efficient in the sense that even more middlemen are cut out.  The same goes for other 2.0 ideas.  With rules set in math you can replace the stock market.

i'd argue that we are reaching a point where a penny is meaningless so you could assign the smallest unit of bitcoin as 5 cents instead of a penny. If the smallest unit was a penny then a bitcoin would be worth a million dollars. If the smallest unit was 5 cents then one bitcoin would be 5 million. 5 million times 20 million is 100 million million or 100 trillion. That's if bitcoin became like gold and something else took the micro transaction crown.

The part that gets me is how they go above the call of duty? to police what transactions are for. If it's coins from a gambling site for instance I believe they lock that account or something. Whereas banks don't police money. They report suspicious transactions (meaning over 10k) but they don't ask you when you deposit 400 dollars how did you get that 400 dollars and even if they did ask you they don't actively investigate further. Maybe it's because of Charlie Shrem.

most interesting part of the article: "Moreover, the inefficiency of interbank settlement services has little to do with technology. The primary reason inter-bank settlement takes days to clear comes down to regulations.
These regulations exist for a number of reasons. Most of them are designed to reduce risk via lengthy, often manual processes. These delays allow banks to reverse transactions if needed"

You're not really understanding the way it works though. You can create any type of asset with colored coins for instance sure. But the ripple network takes sets of IOUS and searches the debts and credits and finds ways to make transfers happen with different kinds of currencies. You might be able to program that function on top of bitcoin somehow using colored coins but in the end you would just end up having what ripple already is.

It's ironic that gavin's motive is ultimately to "move opinions from "Bitcoin is Evil and must be eliminated" .
I wonder if he realizes that mainstream media uses propaganda tactics and they have been using it with bitcoin since the beginning. They always mention crime and anything criminal together with bitcoin so people associate them together. This alliance has simply given them another news article to correlate bitcoin with crime some more.
Consider a few things: The crime in a typical populous city in the United states on a single day has more murders than bitcoin has in it's existence. Why not make an alliance to stop murders in the city near you? Why not make an alliance to investigate HSBC further and figure out how they got away with laundering so much money with minimal fines? Who did they pay off?
Why do all these government agencies need help understanding how to track criminals when they obviously have some basic skills since they apparently have a back door in everything? They obviously know how to use back doors. What is so complicated about bitcoin that you need to explain to them? It's a public ledger and therefore it's more transparent than something like HSBC bank.

For me at least, that doesn't give a satisfactory answer. If someone loads cash into their account so they can send it are they doing that by sending bitcoin to some address?  As far as I can see the only way you can preserve the purchasing power and not be subject to volatilty is one of two ways: You either find someone making the same exact trade in the opposite direction for the same amount at the same time. Or you find a way to create some derivatives where people short the market by buying temporary derivatives or something.

From what I understand, private blockchains for banks will just do what the liquid network does for bitcoin exchanges... makes settlement faster.

I still don't understand how they got access to the bitcoins. His laptop was open and they rushed in before he could close it... okay. That gives them access to some things. But what kind of wallet doesn't have it's own password when being used? My netbook asks me for my password before I sign a transaction (armory) so even if someone had full access to my netbook they couldn't access the offline wallet. The exception is if they found a backup somewhere either digital or paper. Was he dumb enough to store the backup on the actual laptop with the wallet in digital form?

This is correct. What the banks are calling blockchain isn't a block chain. It's a chain but they won't use blocks because blocks are just a bunch of transactions lumped together and set into the chain at certain intervals. Bitcoin and other massively distributed ledgers need the time between the transactions to lump them all together because it is massively decentralized and everyone needs to agree on what happened
@_date: 2015-10-25 23:10:10
Even if the block reward is halved, the supply isn't going down... it is still going up because bitcoin is in an inflationary period. The supply is however many coins are created already. The rate at which they are create changes the supply so that it is no longer increasing as rapidly. It is impossible to say exactly what will happen with the price .  If the reward halves half of the miners could drop off the network because they are no longer profitable and the ones that are left will be getting at most the same amount of bitcoin that they were before the halving. I think there will be some at least modest pressure for the price to go upward because some unprofitable miners will continue mining and they will hold their coins longer than they would have otherwise until there is a point at which they are profitable to sell. I think if you ran some statistics you would find that new coins have a higher chance of being sold than coins that are old so there is a disproportionate amount of sell pressure coming from new coins so less new coins could lead to a higher price as well.

Just like how the banks could still operate if loaning was separated from the rest(eliminating the concept of reserves and reserve ratios), the monetary system could still operate just as well if banks assets were unchanged when a loan became insolvent.

If the state of Colorado is smart (greedy) they could fix this pretty easily.
Step 1: Colorado state accepts bitcoin for state taxes
Step 2: All the people in the marijuana business accept bitcoin as payment
Step 3: Flush with bitcoin, all the marijuana business can convince the businesses in their supply chains to accept bitcoin since any business can pay their taxes with it. Especially if it is given at a discount.
Step 4: Marijuana businesses can pay their taxes now with bitcoin and the government gets money easier and faster than before, with proof.
Step 5: Flush with bitcoin the State of colorado can then *offer* to pay out their employees salaries in bitcoin at any percentage. So if the state had tens of thousands of employees and just a small percentage accepted a small percentage of their pay in bitcoin (which they could then use to purchase weed and such) then the government wouldn't need to sell the bitcoin for cash.
Would be cool to see colorado become the bitcoin capital of the country. I recently visited Aspen and it was amazing.

Isn't the main reason people say this actually because banks can lend in excess of their reserves (depositors funds) and charge interest while people can't? 
By funny money I thought you meant money that is readily debased. If you took the banking system and separated it from transactional accounts, and removed reserve ratios.... The only difference between your money and the money created in this system that you call "funny" is that instead of the bank lending 9 dollars for every 1 dollar in reserve they lend 9 dollars for every 0 dollars in reserve. It essentially would remove a tool that banks use for controlling the money supply. 
When a loan is paid back money is essentially destroyed so I assume that when a banks assets are reduced when a loan fails that  the outstanding loan also disappears from circulation? This means that if banks weren't required to cover the expense of a failed loan then it would lead to inflation... something we already have. The only difference between the two systems is hypothetically more inflation.

He is right that having such a huge discount is going to want to make people get hold of bitcoin that otherwise wouldn't have. Right now there are some other benefits for spending bitcoin: you don't have to give your name, and if it's an online service you don't need to give an address which means you don't need to make an account either. You also don't need to give your payment details which can be stolen later so from a privacy and security standpoint it' superior. it's just that bitcoin is hard to get hold of, too volatile for some peoples tastes, and too young so problems like hardware wallets aren't common solutions yet

There never needs to be an inflation rate. The point of one would be to compensate for not enough funding from transaction fees alone. The point would be to secure the network and the value that is there. But for the people who do have value there they are motivated themselves to secure the network. If they didn't subsidize the cost of miners for security themselves then they would gravitate out of the bitcoin network and their worth would leave and there would be a balancing act because now there is less wealth at risk for the miners to secure. The amount of mining and hashrate should be somewhat proportional to the wealth stored by the network. An inflation rate would also result in miners shooting themselves in the foot because their revenue has the bitcoin price itself as a determining factor. A rate which would surely drop drastically in the advent of an inflation rate.

1 000 000 bytes - 250 bytes for an average transaction = 999 750 bytes left.
999 750 / 34  29404
600 seconds in 10 minutes so
29404 / 600 is 49. So if you used a clearing house you could have as many as 49 transactions per second if they were bundled by a clearing house.  But yeah the block size limit does need to be raised.

There are investments in this world that earn more than 5% return annually.

Does the IRS force you to pay taxes on a stock that appreciates in value? Don't they wait until you actually sell the stock to charge any capital gains?

I think bitcoins  use will be as a hedge against inflation. An ordinary person doesn't have much reason to buy bitcoins to pay for pizza online for instance when they can just use a credit card. But an ordinary person does have an incentive to hold value in bitcoins instead of dollars if they have more than a couple thousand dollars in dollars because every minute that goes by more are being printed.

what is significant though?

If the bitcoin price drops and he sells them later he would essentially have to pay less in taxes. Just wishful thinking I suppose

In my opinion bitcoin isn't a typical investment. It's not just a thing you throw your money at because you think it might be successful. I think bitcoin is bigger than that and it represents a new found freedom and that if you truly believe in it then it is worth becoming a part of. If you can't become a part of it through some entrepreneurial idea then buying it is one way to do that.

I agree mostly. They shouldn't be taken offline though. They should limit orders to what their system can handle. Disable high frequency trading until they can actually handle normal people trading. If they completely shut down the price will definitely look like it's going lower because people will send coins to other exchanges (but they can't send dollars) and the price would plummet

if they were smart instead of selling their bitcoins eventually to finance the site and pay off the supplier they would offer the supplier bitcoins with the terms of it being that they don't have to meet minimum amounts anymore for the next year or something. Then supplier might want bitcoins so much because of their appreciation he might accept. Or not. Just thinking out loud

just a tip......... tomorrow or tuesday would probably be a better day to sell if you are going to sell. Of course the past behavior is not a prediction of future behavior but in reality....... funds go through starting tomorrow. In my opinion everyone who buys into bitcoin as an investment should only invest half of what they want to invest and keep the other half in case it drops in value. then they can buy in at the lower value. I bet by the end of the year we will break 300.

I'm sure there will be a way to setup recurring payments in the future. You can count on it. One way you could do it is setting up a shared wallet. Both you and the merchant have access to the key. You can send funds to this wallet any time before the merchant goes to pick up the funds. So if the fee is once a month you could send funds to the wallet the day before that day... or even hours before. Or you could prepay a bulk amount.. say several months at once. You could do this manually or I am sure in the future you will be able to have a sophisticated wallets that let you dole out payments on a recurring basis to specified addresses

I'll give one more example because I should have probably explained that section further.   Suppose that bitcoin was worth 1 dollar a piece. And there are now currently 11 million of them. Suppose I wanted to buy a 35 million dollar yacht. Not that easy is it? There aren't even enough to do that. A higher price (due to deflation) Not only allows a purchase like this... but it allows it to DO more things. Deflation is incredibly healthy for bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-04-13 01:11:23
I think this one is easy........ when mt gox went down people started moving to other exchanges. They overflowed them with coins (instead of dollars) because coins are fast to move and dollars are slow. Now the prices on these exchanges which are usually higher than mount gox are lower because they have coins that were recently moved. If bitfloor is higher than BTC-e thats probably because people left too many coins on BTC-e instead of moving back to gox.

@_date: 2013-04-15 01:51:21
There is always someone willing to sell bitcoin and selling is the same as spending. If more and more people decide not to sell or spend their bitcoins then the price starts going up at which point someone along the way suddenly decides to spend them either because they want something or because nothing can continually go up (even a deflationary currency). So you don't know for a fact.

I think the whole lending friends credit aspect of ripple is secondary to ripples main purpose which is as a decentralized exchange. Someone on bit talk forums made this statement which enlightened me : "Keep in mind that you are already using IOUs today. When you deposit money at MtGox, you get USD IOUs which are just an entry in their database. When you buy Bitcoins using the MtGox trading platform, you spend your USD IOUs and receive Bitcon IOUs which again are just entries in the MtGox database. It is only when you "settle", by requesting either that actual dollars or Bitcoins be sent to you from MtGox, that you have something tangible.
Ripple works exactly like this, except the IOUs are more explicit and they can be cryptographically stored, sent, and received in a safe and efficient fashion between any participants."

In bitcoin transactions it is really only necessary for 1 of the 2 parties to have "technology". FOr instance someone could keep a paper wallet and it doesn't involve technology really (they could have even written it down and not used a printer)
also he says that it is a big problem of how it relies on technology.. I think I read some statistic a while ago that said there are as many cell phones now as people in this world. Billions. With the trend in technology this isn't a problem at all and in fact the target audience of bitcoin just by it's nature of being stateless and borderless.... is already theoretically much larger than even the dollar with the current technology of today.

If you wanted to actually run a real economy off bitcoin you could create a new currency that is fractionally reserved backed by bitcoins.

And if you really wanted you could create an initial reserve ratio that slowly adjusted over time so that means you could expand the money supply with fine grain control

Here is would I have said to the brit guy
People switching to bitcoins doesn't mean government won't be able to tax you. If you walk into a brick and mortar shop it is up to that shop legally to charge you tax whether or not you pay in bitcoins or dollars. If you buy something on the internet then it is already up to the individual to report that tax whether they pay in dollars or in bitcoins or whatever. There is, however, a tax you will be able to avoid (somewhat) if you use bitcoins and that is the inflation tax. Already in the US, about 40% of government operations are funded simply through the printing of more money. With people using bitcoins that is obviously going to affect them to a less degree. And that is not a bad thing because taxing people through inflation is an insidious way to do it. It allows government to get much bigger than it should. If they tried to directly tax people for that much money then there would be much more resistance to all these perpetual wars and government intrusions on our personal lives that we are seeing.

I would say that just as important as spending in bitcoin... is selling goods and services for bitcoin (like a merchant) . but anyone can be a merchant in their own way. You can sell items like you would on ebay... or vehicles or property/houses. The bigger the more it will help the bitcoin economy
@_date: 2013-03-01 09:01:51

eh? 
"there are also yearly memberships that, in Mega's words, let you "lock in the value of your bitcoin and save 17% over monthly vouchers." These cost about 5.44 bitcoins for a year of 500GB storage, 10.88 bitcoins for 2TB, and 16.32 bitcoins for 4TB. "
500gb per month is 0.53 btc. 500gb per year at a lockin would be 5.44 btc.  If they lose value .. say half value then next month the monthly rate for 500gb would be .53 X 2 or just over 1 bitcoin. If it stays at that rate for the rest of the year then he would have at the end of the year 11.5 bitcoins rather than just 5.44 with a rate that is half what it is now. Meaning he'd lose wth a lock in....... assuming that he didn't sell immediately. If he just sells the bitcoins immediately then the future price of bitcoin isn't even an issue.

It's hard to know the answer about bitcoin worth. I don't see why it would drop. Having these super mining rigs doesn't make it "easier" to get a bitcoin collectively. It might make it easier to someone who has one but they had to pay dearly for it. And ultimately the amount of bitcoins that mined won't increase. So you are essentially just competing against other miners for a share of the daily 3600 new coins (not including transactions).
If I had to take WILD guesses I would guess this: The amount of big rigs released this year will probably be a few hundred. so say 300. The amount of matching power from other sources will probably equal just the big rigs. So lets say 300 more. That means if you get one you might get 1/600th of the daily share of 3600 coins. Or 6 coin per day at best. 180 coins per month.  2160 per year minus about 30 for power so 2130 coins in a year. That is probably way off lol but if you did manage to get 2k coins per year off of one then you could easily make your money back. There could just as easily be 3 thousand "rig" sized mining units released though I'm not sure about the statistics

In satoshis whitepaper he says that one of the primary purposes of bitcoin is because government issued money gets inflated too easily basically... so bitcoin has a hard limit. And since it has a hard limit... why not 21 million? If each bitcoin represents 100 million satoshis then that is an adequate amount of units for a currency. I have also read that bitcoin could be changed to represent even more than that.  Bitcoin is kind of like gold in that it's only worth what people will pay for it... and if bitcoins market was as large as gold then it's volatility would be similar to gold. I think bitcoin could potentially go to an even greater market than gold because it's more useful than gold.

It can't go up without fluctuating. Just look at the price of bitcoin in the past. It has never continually gone up. Not a single day. Not a single hour in a day. In fact probably not even a single minute of a single day has bitcoin only gone up and never down in value. If a deflationary currency always goes up then why hasn't bitcoin always gone up? Even if it was mainstream and had deep markets it wouldn't always go up.
@_date: 2013-04-05 23:47:21
If you are worried about the security issues what you could do is print a paper wallet from bitcoinaddress.org . After you print it (and make backups) you can then copy the public address somewhere. Then put the wallet in a safe deposit in a bank. At this point it is still empty... you can then add to that wallet just by using the public address while your wallet remains locked in a bank vault. That seems pretty secure to me.  If you want to be able to spend your bitcoins and save them then the best solution is probably armory... it's what I use. It allows you to store your bitcoins on an offline computer. That makes it unhackable. Secondly it is also encrypted so anyone who has physical access to it will not get your coins. You can print several backups and store them somewhere safe but not all in the same place.

One thing I find funny... the mainstream media is claiming bubble bubble. When have they ever been good at detecting bubbles? I'm not saying it is or isn't though but someone commented elsewhere that just because something might be a bubble doesn't mean it's overvalued.

I'd also say that one of the most underrated aspects of bitcoin is greed itself. Greed is a powerful force and it's an important aspect in the bootstrapping of bitcoin as a currency. Without the early adopter incentive there might not have been as many early adopters. It gets the ball rolling. And the ball is definitely rolling.
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:24:40
One thing to keep in mind is that most of the past few weeks and months that people have first heard of Bitcoin and gotten involved.... they have never really seen it go down in value. THey have only seen it go up. That could scare some people away but I think there are just too many people interested in bitcoin right now for it not to go up again and ultimately succeed. The only worrying factor is that stupid 30 minute lag on mount gox to make a single trade.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:11:18
What I meant was benefits worth the cost, correct. There are more benefits as far as cost is concerned than illegal goods. I'll name some I can think of: You can move millions of dollars around from one country to another country for pennies. That is cost effective considering alternatives. There is a whole other area where cost effective can come into play: any transaction that is normally done with credit cards that has a high rate of fraud typically carries with it a higher cost of processing that payment because of that fraud. This means if bitcoin was used someone will save that money. Either the merchant can pass the savings on to the customer or they can save it themselves or a mixture of both.
@_date: 2013-03-01 07:49:57
That wasn't the point. If bitcoin deflates (increases in value) then it's easier to make large transactions. You can buy a house easier if bitcoins are worth 1 thousand a piece than if they are worth 10 cents a piece because you don't need the whole money supply for the transaction. A higher valuation of bitcoin will allow it to enter newer markets. If someone doesn't spend today, but saves instead... that only deflates the currency which again... doesn't hurt the ability to transact bitcoin to bitcoin or bitcoin to anything.

You're missing the point. If someone has a 5% return on an investment they aren't going to put everything into it. They will still make purchases. So if someone converts all their wealth to bitcoins even if it earns 5% return they aren't save the entirety of their bitcoins and not spend anything.

I had  a few ideas: 
1. a spam free email system (off the blockchain) . Someone who wants to send mail to someone else on the system (or off the system) can do it and they pay a small fee. Maybe the equivalent of 1-5 cents. This fee is put in reserve and if the person responds to the email then you get the fee back. A spammer doesn't usually get responses. And whatever fees in reserve that didn't get returned would go towards the service

I would disagree. If a hoarder buys bitcoins for the purpose of hoarding then he might not have bought them otherwise. If he hadn't bought them then their price may not have been as high as it currently is.  A rising price through the investment of people who consider bitcoins as a store of value give credibility to it as a store of value and can only help it in the long run.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:07:02
I made a mistake a year ago thinking I was "too late" to invest. Instead of thinking that get rid of it from your mind and rather think.. Will bitcoin succeed? That's really the only question. If bitcoin succeeds it's value has to be worth a lot. It simply can't be worth as little as it is now if it has even a modicum of success. And by success I mean it's a borderless... stateless currency. If it captured even a fraction of 1 percent of the world transaction market.. then it would have to be worth thousands. There are a couple reasons why it might not succeed. Government/bank intervention, scalability issues.. and just because we are heading into uncharted territory there are some possible unknown issues.

For the record I am not saying there won't be bubbles. There will be. Mini bubbles.. probably big ones too. For instance right now... if someone spent around 1.5 million they could push the price of bitcoins from 104 to 114. That's 10 dollars... multiplied time the amount of bitcoins out there that would increase the market cap by 100 million dollars. So a measly 1.5 mill can increase the total value of bitcoins in existence by 100 million. That of course will cause some bubbles.  But aside from that.... even if bitcoin will be in a bubble or is in a bubble that doesn't necessarily mean it's overvalued.

Your chances of coming out ahead are less I think if you are not willing to hold. For instance if you bought last time at 30 dollars during that speculation bubble (which is different than now) then 6 months later you would have lost almost everything. But held on longer... till now and you would have broke even. It's a gamble but hey.......... you could always just play satoshi dice 50/50 and find out quickly whether you will make your investment :)

Take silk road for example. Imagine if bitcoin was destroyed. What would happen? Litecoin or some variant would take it's place overnight. It's like a hydra you cut one head off another will pop up. Ultimately I see governments/banks going after exchanges. If they do that they can severley hurt the price of virtual currencies. But they can't eliminate it entirely.  bitcoin was as useful at 5$ a bitcoin as 100 $ for purchasing drugs on silk road so in that respect at least it would probably still survive even if exchanges were targetted.

When I first started sending the money the price was around 5.50. It dropped to like 2.38 by the time I could buy. I was a little nervous even though it was only 2k so I bought 1k worth at 2.38. I waited a few days and the price kept dropping. finally when the price was down to about 2.10 or so I chickened out and sold my bitcoins and just left the cash on gox.... till I was interested again a year later. &gt;&lt;  What made me finally determined though was reading satoshis whitepaper. I didn't read that the first time around. Also I didn't see bitcions being used much. That changed big time in one year so I definitely saw the potential.

Which are you going to want to hold your extra cash in? And if you decide it's bitcoin... then what are the odds you are going to want to cash back out of bitcoin to pay for something when it's not only easier to stay in bitcoin but you don't owe taxes on capital gains as long as you don't cash out?

That depends on how long you are willing to hold them I think. Everyone thinks this is a bubble so you might lose 1/3rd of your money pretty quick. Half at most. But then again it might not be a bubble. We might see it go to 50 or something. Nobody knows what the price is going to do but there are a couple of things you can reasonably guess.
The first being that there is a lot of attention on bitcoin right now and people have seen it go to 30 TWICE. what that means... is there probably isn't a chance anyone is going to let it go down near 10 again. Millions would be invested before they let that happen.
The longer term outlook of bitcoin is pretty good except........ for government intervention. If that happens who knows what will happen. Some people think it will actually raise the price. Some think it might just drive a different cryptocurrency to lead.
Finally it's just my opinion but buying bitcoins.. using them and endorsing them is a vote for freedom. The kind of freedom that is real and powerful and the kind that we have never really had... ownership of our own currency.

Only buy them if you have balls and can see the value of them drop by half without panic. The only time you should panic is if there is a damn good reason of a price drop: 1. block size problem / fork problem. 2. government trying to kill bitcoin problem. Other than that bitcoin is a very necessary tool . It's a new protocol for money and if people can't see the use in that they are fools.

Making merchants responsible for collecting taxes does affect bitcoin users and credit card users alike. If you use bitspend for instance and try to buy something through amazon with internet tax you are going to be paying that tax. Unless bitspend relocates to new hampshire or something but then that would be a legal grey area and risky.

 The price of bitcoins will eventually stabilize because of greed. More speculators will get involved in bitcoin and the more speculators there are the more they are willing to undercut each other for profit. If one speculator waits for a 10% rise before selling or a 10% drop before buying then another might undercut him and wait for 9%. And The more speculators the more they will undercut leading to somewhat of a stabilization.

Seeing as people have gotten rich from bitcoins it IS a way to get rich. That's a fact. If you extrapolate the past into the future.... then it's still possible to get a high return but that entirely depends on how many people are going to use it in the future. If the current people that use bitcoin are all that use it and it doesn't grow... then no you certaintly won't get rich. If the amount of people using it grows so that what we have now and what we will have in the future is like what we had in the past compared to what we have now then the returns can be comparable. That's common sense. Bitcoin isn't just a currency. It's like a new protocol for money on the internet in addition to being a great store of value

That's what I'm waiting for. I consider them undervalued. When you look at bitcoins as a new protocol... like email... or like bittorrent... but for money, you would begin to realize it's power. When you can simply post an address beside your name and someone can send a million dollars worth of value to that address in a matter of minutes... at any distance for little cost and without exchange of any other information. It's so powerful. One tactic I'd thought I would use on some naysayers... how about we bet? Betsofbitcoin lets people bet right here... right now using a currency with real value. That would be difficult to arrange with dollars or gold or whatever. It just shows what kind of power and areas that bitcoin can fill.

since it's open source software they could even include a client on peoples desktops. What would be cooler than an integrated payment protocol with your operating system? But that would be further down the line maybe. I'm talking about integration with their software center... to pay for support... to donate.. to buy things. And of course if they are coming out with a mobile phone they are going to need something like Google play. Imagine if they integrated bitcoin with that and had that as a payment system option for apps? No chargebacks. Imagine how much that could save in the fraud department. The bitcoins would go to the developers and they could take a small cut.

Technically the income tax that goes to pay the public debt gets rebated to the treasury (minus some cut). The whole beneficial relationship between the federal reserve and the government has numerous other perks that aren't directly the interest that is paid on the public debt.

@_date: 2013-03-23 23:42:37
in my opinion the surge was actually related to the FinCEN release. it happened about that time and it also means that bitcoin isn't illegal. Also it's easy to create bubbles.... all it takes is like 5 or 10 million dollars to drive the price of bitcoin up by 10 dollars... and 10 dollars increases the market cap by 100 million dollars. I think eventually the price might be more stable when there is more market depth... and more volume. The short term speculators who are looking for quick profits will be more willing to undercut each other and that will create a more stable price. Maybeeee.

asking who in their right mind will spend them is basically the same question as who in their right mind will sell them. It's the same thing. People will always be willing because the future is uncertain primarily and also because they may just need to sell.

@_date: 2013-12-14 04:11:12
I agree partially with you. Credit cards allow people to buy things with money they don't have. You also typically get a percent or 2 back in some form of reward. Those costs are on the merchant though so maybe the item price is slightly raised because of it. 
Chargebacks actually can be achieved with bitcoins. In fact if bitcoin does have a future in transactions it will be from "clearing houses" type of companies that take transactions off the blockchain. The main blockchain will only be used for moving money around. Since transactions would happen off the blockchain then chargebacks are possible. I don't know about cash rewards though but maybe item prices might be cheaper because the merchant you are buying from doesn't have to pay as high of a fee?
You say fraud protecion is impossible... well from the merchants point of view fraud isn't even possible. I consider that a good thing. Sucks for consumers? Not really. It makes more sense to have the burden of trust placed on consumers rather than businesses. It's in the businesses best interest to act with good behavior. It's the opposite for an individual. With off chain transactions though it is kind of a moot point.
@_date: 2013-02-25 01:33:15
As I am reading more about bitcoin... while I think it is brilliant, part of it seems to be a little upsetting. We have all this hashing power right? But the "block" is awarded every 10 minutes to someone. What that basically means is that a block of transactions for the entire bitcoin network is handled by just 1 miner (or group if in a pool) for the entire network. It's a shame that everyone who does hashing doesn't contribute somehow.
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:51:44
this was posted verbatim by some 15 minute old reddit user a few days ago. was downvoted pretty quickly.It also makes no logical sense. If mining were illegal then bitcoin would still continue as normal... miners would just mine from different countries. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:29:31
just go to the bit talk forums and search gavin andresens last posts. Here are some:
The only reason to limit the block size is to subsidize non-Bitcoin currencies or to insulate existing miners from future competition.
I think this is exactly right.
But I also think that choosing a larger-but-still-limited block size won't kill Bitcoin (but not raising the block size at all might-- a payment system with a hard seven-transactions-per-second limit is not Satoshi's vision).
"Finally: in my opinion, there is rough consensus that the 1MB block size limit WILL be raised. It is just a question of when and how much / how quickly."
@_date: 2013-02-20 06:57:43
I see this argument being repeated all the time in various forms. It contradicts itself. You are saying a rising price discincentivizes. At the same time you are saying that volatility is also a problem. You can't have it both ways. If a price is volatile then it goes up ... and down. Not always up and not always down. If a business sells after acquiring bitcoins while the price is rising then they win a little. If the business sells while it's decreasing then they lose a little depending on the time.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:25:03
There is a feature of bitcoin where a transaction can have multiple outputs. What this means is eventually payment gateways will form on top of the blockchain. Users will be able to use these gateways to send microtransactions because the gateways can simply create one transaction and have multiple outputs (microtransactions) sent at once . Bitcoin is still too new for this but it will happen. The downside is that users would have to trust a third party in this instance but they should think of it as a "hot wallet" and only keep small amounts there.

Here was my reply:
"One of the strangest aspects of the Bitcoin frenzy is that the Bitcoin economy replicates some of the most archaic features of the gold standard"
It's only strange because mining is not an aptly used word to describe what is actually going on. If you look in the actual program code for the reward of "finding" a block the code calls it a "subsidy". The "mining" process is actually how transactions are processed. So real work is being done and it not only is what facilitates transactions but it contributes to the security of the network itself. Many things are done in this world that wouldn't have to be done if we lived in a perfect world. If we lived in a perfect world nobody would have to encrypt anything. Nobody would have to waste resources making locks for doors. Nobody would ever have to remember a password. But we don't live in a perfect world. And bitcoin is the only form of wealth you can own that can't be confiscated by someone else if you secure it adequately enough. There are lots of reasons to be genuinely interested in bitcoins but the main reason for me is the freedom it provides. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:25:29
"mysterious money"
I keep seeing this in various news articles about bitcoin. Bitcoin is the opposite of mysterious. It's completely transparent. At any given point of time you know exactly how many coins there are.. you know the details about the network. You know all the rules and how, for instance... in a little over 3 years from now the "subsidy" to miners will halve again. There is nothing mysterious at all about bitcoin.

Most would consider that bitcoin is rapidly rising in price now. And yet still people are making purchases with bitcoins. You can buy new bitcoins the moment you spend some so you can effectively lock in the price.  For instance with coinbase... you can buy coins immediately so the price is locked in. and you can replace whatever coins you might have just spent. I would also say that once again... bitcoins aren't the only currency so they can't affect the economy if people save their bitcoins. The only economy they could affect are a bitcoin only accepting company. But there are arguments against that. People like to spend their money someday. You can replace whatever bitcoins you just spent by buying more. The price of bitcoins doesn't always go up fast. Sometimes it's stable. Sometimes it also goes down.
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:07:08
Just FYI the bitcoin store actually posts an address you can track their progress. Also they are NOT selling their bitcoins... which is why they have made it to 500k partly. Because the value of the bitcoins they have been getting have been rising. They essentially are smart/lucky .
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:14:22
Here is one way to think of it....... Every person that sells bitcoin on a bitcoin exchange is essentially converting their bitcoin to some other form of value. That is all that spending is..... converting bitcoin to another value. The fact that people are selling their bitcoins on the exchange (for everyone that buys there is a seller on the other side) means that there are also spenders since it's essentially the same thing. Now say you are converting your bitcoin to a different form of value . Wouldn't it be nice to be able to do it directly and buy with the bitcoin what you want instead of converting to another medium first? If people aren't spending their bitcoins but instead converting them to cash it 's probably because what they want to buy isn't available for purchase in bitcoins. Or maybe they just think bitcoin will decrease in value. But that same rationale applies to spending.
@_date: 2013-02-22 05:07:03

If bitcoin is so attractive and appealing that someone won't spend it, then wouldn't it also be attractive to someone offering goods or services to get it for those goods and services thereby making the presumption that nobody would accept it false? If people don't spend gold is it worthless?  Anyways you can increasingly buy more things with bitcoin. Bitspend (for instance) lets you buy pretty much anything online.  When I say stay in bitcoin to avoid taxes I don't mean sales taxes or anything of that nature. I mean the appreciation of bitcoins themselves would not be taxable. Even if it was mainstream.

I think you are assuming ebay integrates bitcoin somehow. If someone says they accept bitcoin then they can create a new address for someone to send funds too. and that person can send funds... and there is no way  ebay knows that the transaction even took place.

1. the block limit is simply raised either at a fixed value or by some elastic method and everyone agrees because it is in everyones interest
2. the block limit stays and bitcoins continue to rise in value but transactions are more expensive pushing 1 and/or 2 sub scenarios
     sub1. Clearing houses are born which basically make transfers instantaneous and cheap but also pose security issues.  For instance in a clearing house where transactions are done "off the chain" transactions are no longer necessarily "irreversible".
    sub 2 alt crypto currencies start taking cheaper transactions . How bitcoin will fair with either one of these sub scenarios is unclear to me.

If I were you I would emphasize that bitcoin isn't a threat to lending institutions. Nobody in the future will want loans in bitcoin even if it wildly succeeds (especially then). People don't want deflationary money as a loan they want inflationary money. Cheaper interest rates and easier to pay off. Once you show that bitcoin isn't a threat to that part of banking..... then you can show where it really benefits. Remittance... a type of paypal... a compliment to gold... and a general geek/freedom movement that people are behind. I think a bank would make a lot of money if they became ultra bitcoin friendly... but their parent bank might cut them off?

I can see a couple of reasons. Check this out  . You can buy a 1.9 million dollar condo in new york with bitcoins. Actually it is for bitcoins ONLY. Why? Because the seller must really want bitcoins. That volatility (especially the upward kind) attracts people. Months ago I made a post on bit talk and I said.. if you had 10 million how much would you invest in bitcoin? At the time the price was 20 dollars each. A good deal of people in that thread including me would have made out like bandits had we already been 10 million millionaires.
There are a couple of other reasons I can think of. What if you are buying something valuable like property in another country? Imagine not having to go through the whole exchange your currency into another currency and transfer fees losing a huge percentage of your value. 
These are just a couple of reasons.

This one is easy......... demand. When you buy bitcoins through coinbase using their original method... what they do is buy the bitcoins for you using their funds... and then they wait for your funds to arrive before they give you your bitcoins. That's the only way they can "lock in" the price for you. The problem is they have a limited amount of funds so they can't service everyone. So now they allow you to send money and simply buy at whatever price it is when your money arrives. This allows them to service more people than before. The problem isn't coinbase .

  I dunno what's driving the price rise. My advice is still "only invest time or money you can afford to lose"

The actual funds were still held in America before this deal.

The fastest way is probably localbitcoins. Some people mentioned that a capital one 360 account hooked up with bitfloor is fast too. I heard there is a line 8 thousand people long for mt gox verification but I'm not sure if that verication is needed for deposits. Anyone? Then you also have bitinstant or ziggap with wire transfer fees but fast (and I think 500 dollar limits) . I'd stay away from coinbase for now though their supply is constantly being bought out. Too much demand

I would say it is not as simple as just the lag. The initial crash the bots were driving down the price by artificially selling lower than what the price was making it look worse than it was and causing a panic. Some people sell not because they don't believe in bitcoin but because they think other people are going to panic so they want to profit/not lose because of that.

Just an idea but I wonder why no exchanges partner with banks and share a percent of the profits? That would make banks more "friendly". (Trying to see how the bank can benefit since bitfloors bank just shut them down)
