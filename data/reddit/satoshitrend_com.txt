The 3 hours affects the variance for the attack, not the expected value. I'm assuming the clock for the bet starts running at 0 confirmations. The attacker could just wait 5 minutes and double spend if he is losing. He would have a high variance in the results, because his initially winning bet could turn to a loser during the 3 hours. The expected value for the attack mainly comes from how many confirmations you wait for the bet to be considered open, i.e. at which point the clock starts running.

Use the getrawtransaction call.

I would see a need for a "bank" that takes advantage of the features of the Bitcoin protocol. The bank stores money and also allows to spend money. The money is stored in multisignature addresses and the bank provides storage for keys, but the Bitcoin protocol ensures that the bank can't run away with the money because the clients also have their set of keys. 
The bank also acts as a trusted party in transactions.  The addresses the bank has would be considered green addresses and trusted not to double spend. This allows quick transactions for things like buying a cup of coffee.

You write: "Most bets will be displayed almost immediately but you may have to wait for 1 confirmation. The time used for your bet is still the timestamp of your transaction from the blockchain so it is not impacted by this."
Are you ruling out the possibility of a double spend when the user sees that he is losing?
