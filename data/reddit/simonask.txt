Surprised at no mention of bitstamp.net, which seems to be one of very few real contenders to Mt.Gox at the moment.
Being EU-based, they do require proof of identity and residence in compliance with the anti-money-laundering laws of the Union, but without the liquidity issues of Mt.Gox. European users can withdraw and deposit money via SEPA transfers, which are very affordable.

With exponential adoption, the number of transactions will grow exponentially. It is safe to assume that adoption more or less follows the [logistic function]( in which it is exponential until it reaches a given high number.
However, the number of blocks does not depend on the number of transactions — only the size does.

Because if the value of a Bitcoin changes drastically between the customer agreeing to a price and you receiving the money (and it has been changing at &gt;20 USD/BTC within minutes the last two days), you risk selling your good at the wrong price, which is a risk to both you and your customer. Not only in terms of transactions, but also in terms of getting new people interested in Bitcoin. Who in their right mind gets into Bitcoin today, after a 15-20% price plunge the last 24 hours? Hell, who in their right mind gets seriously invested in Bitcoin on the day when the price increased 300%? People are afraid of bubbles, and in the case of Bitcoin, rightly so!
Bitcoin is absolutely unsuitable as a direct method of payment until the price becomes more stable. Speculation is a *major* roadblock for Bitcoin as it is right now, but it will hopefully ease up with time, as more people get interested and speculators retain a smaller percentage of the market.

Wow. So much delusion in just a few sentences. Of course we cannot "discover" ethical laws.

No. That would be detected as a problem by other nodes, and the blocks generated by that mining node would be rejected and go unconfirmed with the rest of the network.
The maximum block size, however, is not part of the algorithm, but is a practical implementation detail.


No. The maximum block size is not a growth rate, it is an upper bound on the growth. Once that bound is reached, and the number of transactions that each node can handle, transactions will be dropped, until nodes increase their internal definition of the maximum block size. In practicality, they are likely to do that long before the limit is actually reached.


Yes I have. *Point to a single specific thing in my argumentation that is wrong.* I dare you. Also, fantasies? Wishful thinking? With reference to what, exactly?

[The Bitcoin protocol spec: block]( A block contains a list of transactions. A new block is generated every 10 minutes, but the number of transactions goes up, therefore each block contains more and more transactions.
You're wrong, and you haven't understood the protocol.

As long as adoption is exponential (which it probably is for the time being), the size of each block will grow exponentially within that limit. Once the limit is reached, it must necessarily be changed either by increasing the number of blocks per time or the number of transactions per block.
It is correct that the blockchain size scales linearly with number of transactions, but as the number of transactions *probably* scales exponentially with number of users *and* the number of users grows exponentially over time, the size (in bytes) of the blockchain must necessarily also grow exponentially over *time*.
Although as mentioned, it's *probably* only "exponential" until a certain logistic limit is reached (i.e., when no more people are interested in trading with Bitcoin — or the system has reached its internal infrastructural limit, whichever comes first).

The main (i.e. only, from a financial perspective) difference between speculation and investment is timeframe. Speculation is short-term investment.
With Bitcoin, it's extremely risky to speculate. It's *not* very risky to invest, because in the long run, the price will probably go up. However, in the very short term, it has fluctuated spectacularly.
I bought some BTC back in June, when there was a local maximum, and was "losing" money for a month or two, but by now they've provided a 30% return.
EDIT: Of course, a crucial difference between long-term and short-term investment is also that long-term investment not only provides you a safer return of investment, it also lends credibility to the system in which you're investing. It's becomes a "vote with your money" type of thing more than purely about personal gain. That's a big motivator for many investors in Bitcoin, including myself.

The mathematical facts are as I've stated above. You've provided no argument to the contrary. As the number of transactions grows, so does the size of the blockchain. You cannot represent more information without using more space. It's a basic law of nature. As long as the number of BTC transactions grows exponentially, so will the size of the blockchain in bytes.
Now, if there is a hole in the logic, *please*, by all means, point to it. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:15:48

I provided all the proof already. It's in the protocol spec. There's no argument at all, it's a mathematical fact.


Yes, if the amount of information grows exponentially, so does the size of that which represents it.


Actually, I've come to think that you don't actually understand math. The block size is not finite in the protocol. It is in implementations of it, because it doesn't need to be larger than a certain limit with the block sizes that we are dealing with today. At some point in the future, that limit will have to be done away with or increased. Each Bitcoin node can do that by its own accord.

It's a reasonable prediction, while of course far from certain. MtGox is facing a range of pretty serious difficulties at the moment, especially in the US and Australia (EU seems unaffected for now, but there is a hard €1000 limit on withdrawals and deposits set by their bank in Warsaw).
This makes it very difficult for regular people do get their hands on BTC, limiting the size of the BTC markets.
Until alternatives are around, or the (quite unfair) restrictions on MtGox are lifted, the price on BTC is likely to stagnate or drop slightly as speculators cash out, or tank completely if neither of those scenarios come true and investors cut their losses.
Long story short: We need global alternatives to MtGox.
