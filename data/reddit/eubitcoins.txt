It is not good for MtGox. I think that that people are so young to understand how important for the world is their job and send information for customers. We have the same kind of service. You all time must be transparent and open with information for people which believe you and gives you money or bitcoins. I hope that they make good move in a few hours.

We must talk to old people that Bitcoin is not so new and will change the world ( people don't like big changes ) but is a good for young peoiple. Don't try say that all must use it.

English like English. The sens of words are important. I don't like English language - sorry. I don't know why. But I think that only many words which we will talk to others about bitcoins with a smile make bitcoin strong and give a new world.

UK and US have a very low education. In Poland is many jokes about UK or US education. I compare level of eduction to good countries not to the bottom. You must know that about 30 years ago people in Poland have more information then now. They were more communist propagand but have high level education about literature, technice and nature. 90 % people after secondary school know what is matrix in matematic or what wrote Victor Hugo and how works biological cell ... ask today somebody about it 16 or 17 years old.

In Poland isn't problem in the education. Many of young people are good in medcine or programming. But they are young people but you must remember about that the old ones make decision in the goverment and in the main institutions in Poland. But many Polish university make a lot for Bitcoin. It is long way to go.

Language is not the barrier. Many website in Poland say in Polish language very well about Bitcoin (eubitcoins.eu or bitcoin.pl), but problem is in understanding. People which changed the world 30 years ago today dont have enough power to think under standards ...

About the education  look at the date of this article. Second I work with people in Poland and many of them are very inteligent and have good thinking but I told about level of education. Many school don't learn people but only make a money. Schools like University of Rzeszow, SGH, University in Cracow or Warsaw are very, very good, and these students are perfect and ready for winning in Europe or the World, but I think that this debate goes in wrong direction. Let's talk about bitcoins ...

We must remember one important thing it is the start of bitcoin history. Our people which makes software must understand how important and responsible is their job. If they will be think about money they will be like a doctor which don't think about life of patient but about earned money for yhe operation ... Many software people at the moment when bitcoin price went up forget about good job and think only about money. They makes mistakes and think who is the first and fastest that one is the winner. Wrong way my friends ...

But only for Polish people now. Maybe other languages in the future.

If you make look at Ukraine or Indie the Polish standards of living are very good. But if you make look at Germany or other rich country in Europe the standard is lowest. But about the education ( I am learning young poeple without high school time to time ) and I see like year by year they knows less than people which finished secondary school at 70 or 80 next century. Today people in East Europe are learnning good job not good thinking.

Yes. Map is a map. But I am talking with people everyday about bitcoins and believe me they afraid because many banks and money institutions ( from USA and EU, for Russia Poland is closed for financial sector .... only gas from Russia we must buy) takes money from Polish citizien and give nothing ... we have here many financial piramides and many problems with foregin banks and taxes are crazy in Poland, becasue we are the market for EU and USA.

You are right, my mistake maybe in understanding the world.
