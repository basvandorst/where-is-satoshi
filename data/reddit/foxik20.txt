Going back up bois

I bought the dip yay
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:28:53
I remember last Friday. I made $6k profit that day. When it crashed, however, I panic sold it and lost 7$k over the weekend. Do you think we will reach the second peak?
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:14:22
HODLing is the key my friends
@_date: 2019-07-26 04:02:55
I know. I just never saw that weird ass line
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:26:10
Does it sound reasonable to sell only the profit? Let’s say I made $500 on bitcoin. I sell $500, but keep the rest. Then sell $300. And so on. Is it smart to only sell profits? Amount of bitcoin will be less and less with each transaction, but worth more?
@_date: 2019-07-28 21:03:24
I don't get it. Thus subreddit says bitcoin will go to the moon. If everyone knows it will, then will it not? All of my friends say I am stupid and Bitcoin has no future. News says the same thing. My co-workers disagree with me. My friends overseas say it's never going to be stable. Whom do I trust? So far I have been Hodling, but it's not helping me to grow.
@_date: 2019-07-05 07:04:02
Keeps dropping. I’m HODLing but kind of scared
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:36:29
I hate the fact that I made 7$K and lost 8$K. Sold it all today, bought stocks, but stocks only decreased my profits. I am also a pattern day trader. WHY? why I didn't sell at my profit of 7$K, expecting even bigger income? I could have had a luxury life for a month or two. Why Destiny does it to me? I am so disappointed that I am back to square one. What are the chances that bitcoin will go up this week? I feel terrible and keep losing. Can anyone predict???
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:04:56
It will stabilize. I hope. Maybe not. Shit
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:02:29
It is still very depressing that during the previous rise from 8 to 13K I made 8$K, and lost 8$ because I panic sold it. Lesson learned.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:33:59
It can’t go down. I put 100% of my entire money for bitcoin. When it go up ?!
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:33:28
Slow growth is what I see. It’s a good thing
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:14:53
14015 as highest then drop to 130071 and 12750 as lowest
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:03:03
Is it going up this weekend or no??
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:01:56
When I saw the notification on my Yahoo finance app I thought this is it shit as a bitcoin is going to go down but so far it is not going down. Do you guys think it is going to go down tomorrow or if it’s actually going to go up?
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:27:23
I’m afraid to HODL all because I put all of my money to it. I started following my 50% tactic. Invest 50% into bitcoin, sell 50% if it’s going down, etc. am I a complete retard ? Lol
@_date: 2019-11-02 08:59:56
This wasn’t prediction. Just two guesses that turned out to be true due to volatility of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-24 17:13:42
Is there any legitimate prediction for this week? I’m in South America hiding from people, will it last for me while I rent things here, but my entire savings is on bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:49:06
Not sure what to do. How to gamble? When it drops ? I’m so tired of not gambling right and losing. I want money. We suffer a lot with family. We need money and it will bring happiness. Although money doesn’t make happy. But I wouldn’t mind. I’m like Eminem. But going to school.
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:58:14
I want Bitcoin to go up and never go down. It will happen tonight. It will skyrocket. I just feel it.
@_date: 2019-08-22 18:36:18
HODLing is the best thing in the world. I used to panic and lost so much. Now I’m just relaxed and making money.
@_date: 2019-08-26 01:17:22
It just went up 5%
I never claimed to be predictor
I just feel that soon it will go big
It’s only my personal opinion
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:52:39
Protestors have nothing to do. Go to work, create new car, don't do this stupid shit...
@_date: 2019-08-25 23:48:29
I can pretty much guarantee we’re going 13k this week
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:34:37
I was so right damn
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:03:32
Exactly stocks tomorrow will go down by 2-4%. Hence, Bitcoin will go up.
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:53:48
what the hell is going on??? I lost 50% of my savings! Hodl or sell before I have no money for rent????
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:47:08
I have put my entire mortgage and savings to it. Hopefully it works out
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:48:14
Of course I’m trolling

No, the dangerous gases contained chemicals that could’ve been the cause of cancer and organ failure of our family.

What if all subreddit buys $10K of bitcoins, let's make it go up!
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:27:28
How do I know which company will skyrocket? Bitcoin went down, but target is up 19%!!! I am so depressed I didn’t buy it. Is there a stock predictor? Which one will go super up tomorrow? I really need fast cash ASAP. I have to pay for rent, phone, health insurance, but my entire savings is on bitcoin. Is it skyrocketing soon?
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:53:04
You share account with her? Why? Just hide shit
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:44:46
I need a prediction cause I need some money ASAP
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:18:40
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:46:38
It’s only 2 predictions? Isn’t it easy because we can have thousands of people make predictions and one will be coincidence? Is it really hitting 16k? How reputable the great prophet is? What’s his background ?
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:31:49
I really need bitcoin to go up because I make irrational decisions. I am an engineer and I can go work but the idea of becoming instantly rich with bitcoin made me not to apply to jobs, become lazy, and check my phone every five minutes. I have lost a lot of nerves since May and still waiting for the day X. And every time I sell and quit the game, bitcoin goes up, every time I buy, it goes down. So I lose even more. I really need to meet the prophet. And ask him the truth. I don’t want to work hard after cancer, deaths, betrayals, viruses, dangerous gases at home. I deserve a big bonus from life and destiny and just chill. Once bitcoin goes up and I make a lot of money, I will improve the world, give money to family members , establish charity, but Porsche , invest into Apple. I need that boost. The more I lose, the more upset and unstable. But once it up, I can make a world a better place.

Part of my comment was trolling. But the other part is really sad about target stock lol
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:59:32
I will keep hodling. I just semitroll semi stress here lol
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:05:02
Then we’re rich forever. Or recession will devaluate dollar. So buy Lamborghini right away before price goes up to $2,000,000,000
@_date: 2019-10-02 23:13:02
I am a firm believer that Bitcoin will spike up sooner or later. It will happen, but the scary part is that if it will go up really really high, it can mean that the actual currency will devalue.

Old Toyota was much better than the new one. New Supra sucks big time.
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:18:16
It’s going up this weekend up to 14$ k
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:03:07
I’m more concerned between getting either a Porsche 911 with Cayenne or BMW X7 with Boxter. Or maybe I want Tesla. I’m so indecisive.
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:16:14
Thanks. But yeah bitcoin is a new joy lol
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:22:51
So let’s hope stocks go down and bitcoin goes to the moon?
@_date: 2019-10-26 08:47:20
Email those people  and ask refund

What day of October will prophet come true? I need to pay my car rent, bills, electricity. I believed in prophet since he predicted everything right so I need that boost. Otherwise I’m broken. Is prophet reliable ?

Hello. Will bitcoin go up this weekend ?
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:52:55
What it mean ?
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:12:20
It’s insane how much we made but it’s also sad that this gain won’t bring much to our lives. Sure we might make $1000, 40000, even $40000 but it will be enough just for one car, restaurant eating, and one-two years of bill payments.

My first kiss was on Friday night in college in my dorm room. It was nothing sexual and pure. I will remember it for the rest of my life. It was so special

This is an interesting bet

Yes, I am a famous exActor who almost went big after high school, but left that career because it brought too much attention. I deleted my old Facebook and went to a different city and a degree, but the ghost of the past, the one that made me an actor, also made me lose money by gambling. I must eradicate this gene and learn from mistake. I can change future.

What sucks is that I can’t go to Tesla and pay with bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:13:14
I made 6k with bitcoin and now I’m back to 800 plus only. Why. Why I didn’t sell ?
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:06:30
I don’t think bitcoin is fdic secured...

@_date: 2019-09-21 01:09:13
It’s not going up. People need money. I bought jeans phone and clothes. How can I day trade? I lost $5000 in few months . I’m scared
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:13:47
Guys, I had a dream that Bitcoin will cost $200,000 tonight.
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:07:45
I agree. Good thing this is always a trolling post.
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:36:42
Keeps dropping. When up? I’m going broke come on. Can robinhood give me money back? The return policies in stores are 90 days. I will just promise not to use it again under contract.
@_date: 2019-09-07 01:21:13
How can I predict dumps? I made so much and then lost because of dump. I need money that I owe to people. They’re serious. Come on, when it go up?!

Is there a computer predicting models?
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:29:18
I keep selling and buying but can’t predict when it’s low or high so I keep losing in total
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:28:57
I don’t get it. I sold it when it was high and it shows I lost 1000$ wtf
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:41:37
A lot of people will buy bitcoin and then it’s going to tank after the show
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:33:43
Is it gonna go up today again ? I forgot to sell profit ?
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:00:13
Holding right now. Very tempted to sell lol
