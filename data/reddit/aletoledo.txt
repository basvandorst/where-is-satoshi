not quite though. Bitcoin is not a pure demand item. Nobody really wants bitcoin, they want something else. Investors want to exchange their BTC for USD and merchants want to exchange their products for USD as well. The difference between an investor and a merchant is that a merchant isn't looking for a profit from BTC, then just want to sell their product.
So as more merchants come on board with BTC, they will be exchanging BTC for USD a lot more than investors who buy and hold. So when a merchant receives a BTC payment, they will immediately try to sell it. Therefore when you say price rises with increase demand, technically a merchant is decreasing demand, since they sell the BTC virtually immediately. So it's important to not confuse demand with volume.  A merchant adds volume, but doesn't really change demand. 
So just because more merchants adopt bitcoin doesn't mean that demand is rising, only volume. "Demand" will only rise as investors come into bitcoin and remove BTC from circulation. It's this consumption (i.e. removal) that constitutes demand.

I like how you start off admitting that bitcoin has a long way to go to become established. The problem I have with bitcoin is that it utilizes the government fiat to establish itself, so that leaves an impression upon the final "adult" outcome of bitcoin.
Imagine if bitcoin started out cost $100 million for every bitcoin and only millionaires were buying it. As their movement grew and others started to see that it was going to eventually become the new currency, they started to buy in, but they could only afford .00000001 bitcoin (satoshi) for the few dollars they had. All the while todays system was still favoring the millionaires and pumping them full of disposal income to buy more bitcoin.
Whats the end result? The millionaires are still millionaires and the poor are still poor. Great, there is a new currency in the world, but the inequality is still there. What has been accomplished?

Bitcoin is currently just a proxy for USDs, a payment processing system. It might one day become a currency, but it isn't there yet. When people start pricing their good in bitcoin, then it'll start being a currency. Meanwhile goods are priced in USD and converted to BTC for payment processing.

I agree that it's being ignored by the current elites. My problem with it is that it's not solving the problem of inequality, it's just recreating todays paradigm, just with alternate rich elites.
It's like saying "todays system is unfair, but tomorrows system will be fair". How can it be fair when the people at the bottom are still at the bottom and a few new millionaires are in the world.
Ultimately who cares if the currency is changed? The potential rich people are the ones most interested in a paradigm change. Everyone else though, particularly the ones with no hope in todays fiat system or tomorrows bitcoin system can't care any less what the currency is.

This would then be my limitation in knowledge on bitcoin. I thought that a bitcoin could be used as many times as possible within each block. If a bitcoin is only allowed to be used once per block, then that does severely hamper it's velocity. 


Not really. As billions of people start to adopt BTC, yet it's limited in both velocity and amount, then there is a hard limit to the number of daily/hourly transactions ever possible. 
What you're doing to over-ride this limitation is using the USD to floating against it. What you've just said here is that prices will forever be in USDs and when BTC hits this hard limit, then the USD will compensate. This is not a good thing, since it means that BTC can never de-couple itself from the USD.

What most people don't understand about corporations is that their power resides with the person that controls them, not who is listed as a shareholder. it's like saying that the US government is controlled by voters and not by the politicians, yet we all know that is not true.

I agree that it's imbalanced and that mining puts a downward pressure. My disagreement is that usage (i.e. volume) is the solution. 
Currently as a merchant uses bitcoin, they immediately sell it, so that they can pay their suppliers in USD. This is the same downward pressure as a miner. A miner need to sell into USD, because his debts are in USD for all the equipment he bought as well. Miner = merchant (for purposes of downward pressure).

So if I goto the store to buy something and I pay in bitcoin, but I refuse to give a transaction fee, then I will be denied the transfer? For example, I might be standing in the store waiting to buy something, I trying sneaking by without paying any fee and then after 10 minutes it gets rejected. I then try again with a minimimal fee and it gets rejected again. Now I've been in the store for 20 minutes wanting to make a simple purchase. Do I follow this right?

[Isn't bitcoin subject to a "51% attack"]( which could lead to absolute control over bitcoin? Seems like a fairly easy control method by the Federal Reserve or the US government if they wanted to drop $1 billion on some ASICs to control BTC if they wanted. $1 billion to them is a rounding error.

The paper that a USD is printed upon is physical, not the money itself. A bill torn in half doesn't cease to be money.

I agree with your definition of digital. However what does it mean to be analog? [Using this definition]( the material itself would have to change to represent the signal. 
So if gold was to be our analog currency, it could be measured in simply units of weight. There is nothing changing in the material varies the value of the gold. I would say that for gold to be an analog representation of "money" and/or "value", it would have to physically change. So perhaps gold jewelry could be an analog currency. If one piece of 10 ounce jewelry is more valuable than another 10 ounce piece of jewelry, then there is an analog representation of money or value in the material itself.
However if we do this, we lose the fungiblity of modern currency. I think it would still be a currency, but modern economists would reject it as not ideal for losing this characteristic.
@_date: 2015-01-25 14:01:23
I don't think saying that adequately describes digital vs analog. Remember we're talking about analog in the sense that it's relating to computer signals. [Taken from here:](
* An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information... a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena

I think you read that wrong. A settlement network is indeed a medium of exchange.

A "medium" is the middle ground, the go between of two things. In mathematics if you find the medium, it's the middle of two numbers. In chemistry, it's the substance between two molecules. These all point to the idea of a network between two people wanting to trade.
Perhaps what you really mean to say is that it's not money, which implies a long term store of value.

The fact that the possibility exists is what is important. For example, if I buy a house and learn that someone else own it at the same time, thats not a good model of ownership. Two people can't own the same thing at the same time. Not that there can't be accidents occasionally, but bitcoin is designed for this to be normal and not an accident.

I agree, so when Greece sells these $50 billion in assets, they are no longer theirs. The question is what exactly are these assets. If they are indeed islands, then it's going to be awkward when NATO puts a base on an island and greece doesn't like it.


We just looped back. So if Greece sells the apartment, then do they still own the apartment?


Who is going to buy a company with no assets? Usually a company owns a building, some real estate or maybe some machines. I think it's safe to assume that the greek banks don't own any machines, so it must be either buildings or real estate.

Well then from his perspective, it's not "his" apartment. To match this to the analogy being discussed, then greece would at some point be able to kick out the the europeans from the island that they "sold". If that was to happen, then it's not really "sold" in a traditional sense.


Call it NATO if you prefer.


I looked for this too. It seems to just say "assets", so I agree with you that people are making assumptions. I can't imagine what other than real estate the greek government has to sell though.

Good point. If debt instruments are what they're selling, then that would be something they could manufacture and sell to the rest of europe. 


Which brings us back to the idea of what this collateral exactly is (e.g. islands, monuments). I doubt the Germans want to take possession of a bunch of unsecured debt "assets". What they really want is the collateral of the secured debts. It's the difference between paper and hard assets.

@_date: 2012-08-05 20:22:34


This is the same for Microsoft. It's recognized that a backup copy of software is acceptable, but "spending" these copies is the problem.


If you spread Microsofts software (appropriating their property) without their permission (dishonestly) they are unable to spread it themselves (permanently depriving).

But you still have the bitcoin "chain" file on your laptop. Nothing is missing. (I think the world chain here is what you refer to, just correct me if I'm wrong)
Now you might claim that you're deprived of interacting with other people while using that "chain" file, because the thief preempted you by using his copy. Microsoft says the same thing. They argue that the thief preempts them by using their stolen file. 
TL;DR: You and Microsoft both have the same files you started with. You're both deprived use of those files to conduct business with others.
@_date: 2012-08-04 23:05:53
I think I understand about the spending twice being impossible. So my question is how do you think IP rights factors into this? If I copy, crack or hack your wallet.dat or your signature or whatever, is that morally wrong? Microsoft would seem to say that it is, because copying their software without a license is going against the spirit of what they set out to do. 
So is it wrong for people to treat bitcoin in the same way? I'm a complete noob to this technology, but to me if you said someone made a copy of your bitcoins, then I would think it the same thing that Microsoft cries about all the time. 
@_date: 2012-08-04 22:21:36

It means that if you are trading your bitcoins with someone else and I somehow interfere with that process. maybe I delete your harddrive, maybe I steal your bitcoin private keys, maybe I declare a tax on any bitcoin transactions or any conceivable way that I can deny you the full enjoyment of your bitcoins. Is it wrong for me to interpose myself in your transaction with someone else.
@_date: 2012-08-06 21:43:31

What can't be copied? Are you suggesting that when a copy is attempted of the private key the computer chokes on it?


you still have your copy though. If we examine the 1s and 0s on your laptop to my laptop, they are the exact same. 


The problem I'm having though is that it is indeed electronic data. What happens if your laptop crashes, aren't you allowed to restore the bitcoins that crashed? This is all encompassed in IP rights.

So if Microsoft claims people stole their software, do you support their claim?

But once a coin is minted, what stops me from copying it? lets say I snuck onto your laptop and copied the bitcoins, who owns them?
@_date: 2012-08-06 22:10:36


It's a strawman though. We're not talking about how people value the house they're buying, we're talking about how people value the piece of paper. A piece of paper, while it can have some variance in value, can't ever be construed to be equal to a house or a car.
Why? Because a component on deciding value is how easily they are acquired. A piece of paper has very little labor input into it and therefore is easy to obtain. A house has a lot more labor it it. 
@_date: 2012-08-04 21:32:19
exactly. I'm not talking about the legitimate use of this system, but the hacking aspect of it all. So what happens if the system gets hacked or cracked or whatever. Someone claims their bitcoins were stolen and the hacker says that he merely "copied" them and that the owner still has his copy.
@_date: 2012-08-05 12:54:20


They are artificially scare. There is no reason that the program couldn't have been written to make them more widely available. In other words, the scarcity is an aspect of the program itself and not a physical characteristic. We could make a copy of your wallet.dat file and give it to everyone in the world, therefor for that moment it's not scarce, everyone has it.
In a similair fashion, you are claiming that World of Warcraft is scarce. Inside that game there is some sword that everyone wants, but Blizzard only releases a couple of them. If we start talking about this part of world of warcraft being scarce and something that the rest of society need to recognize as important of their time, then we need to acknowledge IP rights. Without IP rights, then it's a joke for us to even consider discussing why someone is upset over something designed into that program.
@_date: 2012-08-04 21:36:50


This is exactly my question. If I somehow find a way to copy your bitcoins, then I'm not stealing what you have, I'm merely sharing a copy of it with you.

What you're doing though is trying to use this unrelated concept to bolster your position about what we're really discussing. We're not discussing the marginal value, we both agree with that and that issue is not in dispute in this conversation at all.
What we're talking about is what is money. Your example is talking about **how much** money should be used and not the **why** we use money. The **why** we use money is because it represents more than it's intrinsic value, regardless of how much value that is. 
You don't want to admit that a bitcoin is worthless without the perception by others that it is worth more than it's component parts. if you admit this point, then it leads into asking what this perception is based on, which is property and labor. Our money is a representation of labor/property that resides elsewhere.

The private key sounds like the key. If that is hacked or cracked though, then this opens up the sharing off bitcoin like every other software. Microsoft tries to hide everything with a private key is a sense as well, but people get past that. 
So my question is, if we eliminate IP rights for Microsoft, how can bitcoins owners complain that their software was ever stolen?
@_date: 2012-08-05 02:10:47

A red herring just says "look over there", whereas a strawman says "look over there, I'm beating up your argument".
So when you say that we're not talking about what constitutes money, but rather we're talking about what constitutes value, then you proceed to beat on the idea of value...this is a strawman.
When you argue that we shouldn't discussing strawmen, but instead red herrings....that is a red herring. The discussion of a red herring is so far removed from this discussion that I doubt you'd even start to begin to beat up on it, thus making it into a strawman to refute my original point.


no reasonable person would ever consider the value of a slip of paper as being equal to a house. So while a piece of paper can vary in value, it won't ever vary that much without something other than it's material components.


Thank-you, this is all I wanted you to say.

Right, I can't see how someone could turn down free stuff, especially when it has no real overhead. I've donated the strangest stuff to good will in the past and they don't really turn anything away. 
So I can understand the Red Cross saying "hey stop donating blankets, we're filled to brim with blankets, thats no longer what we need". It's almost like they're saying "hey we need cash at this point to pay our employees, your blankets aren't doing us any good". 
Maybe the red cross is an invalid charity at this point or rather maybe they just no longer want to bother with low hanging fruit. Maybe they should be saying "if you want to donate to us, we only accept X, Y and Z". there can be a market now for other charities to accept blankets, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and bitcoin that the Red Cross is turning it's nose up at.

This is the same thing as telling a restaurant customer that their dinner was cooked perfectly. No matter that the chef and/or doctor did everything perfectly correctly, the customer won't be happy.
A rating system can still work, since it's the bulk of reviews that define the experience. Presumably is enough qualified people vote/rate on something, then an objective measurement emerges from each individuals subjective opinion.
Now i will agree that this is still flawed to some extent. We do this same thing with voting for a president and it yields disastrous results. The problem being that there is an assumption that only qualified people will vote/rate and not just people that are self-interested with a grudge to bear. 
So really bottom line, if we shouldn't be voting on doctors performance, then we shouldn't be voting for politicians as well. At least with voting for doctors, it's just a recommendation which people can choose to ignore. In the case of government, peoples subjective opinions can have a serious impact on our lives.
So I suppose my opinion is that there is nothing wrong with having a review system, it's better than nothing and better than what we have through government.

Sure, the grocery store has lights on and probably air conditioning as well. However using a coin or physical cash to buy something doesn't add to this expense at all. When I reach into my pocket to pull out the coin to pay with, my arm is obviously expending energy, but that is the same amount of energy that it would take to pull out your phone to spend bitcoin. The difference lies in what happens when I drop the coin in the merchants hand versus waiting for some chinese bitcoin farm to crunch the numbers to get the next block processed.

If this is true, then why does it work for restaurants? I think you're giving too much credit to medical services being objective. If they're objective, then so is a well cooked meal at a restaurant.
medicine is just as much of an art today as it is a science. If things were as simply as asking the right questions, then spitting out the right answers, then we could have computers performing this function. Temperature, blood tests and other symptoms could be entered into the computer and out would come a treatment plan or further testing. however it's not this easy and thats where the art of medicine comes into play.

And nobody paid that rate. This is some sort of clarion call for people that want to leech off of the work of others. 
the reality is that when the marginal rates were that high, people did everything they could to find tax havens. So when they finally reduced the tax rate and people no longer had to hide their income, the tax revenue actually went up! You read that right, lowering the tax rate actually lead to more tax revenue!
 Today though what you don't realize is that a 20% federal income tax rate + 10% state tax rate + 14% payroll tax + 6% sales tax = 50%. You only look at your federal tax rate and say it's so low, but you neglect to account for all these other taxes.

Which is something that competing banks would want. There are separate businesses that don't trust one another, so they are not going to trust one bank as a mediator of disputes. 




So lets say that we are at a time when all bitcoin have been distibuted and miners are just skimming off fees from each ledger transaction. What is keeping a consensus together that couldn't be replicated by some banks?
For example, say that all the major world banks get together to do wire transfers using the blockchain. They have an incentive for completing the crypto first in order to collect the fees.

Following your logic then gives us more than sharing in healthcare costs. It also gives us police, fire, education, military, business subsidize and bailouts. Everything that is in place today is there because someone thought it was worth the collective in supporting it.
Now I imagine you're young and you don't pay very much in taxes, but the flaw in this logic is that some people can simply not work and gain all these benefits for free. I'm tired of being the one that has to carry two other people on my back.

I'm not interesting in keeping society alive if it means that everyone is a slave. Plus the thing you leave out of your list of niceties is that the government does some pretty shitty things with our money as well. They build large armies that kill women and children. They lock people away for victimless crimes and they bail out rich bankers when their gambling ventures turn sour. 
So this idea of paying for roads and schools amounts to something like 5% of what they take from us. The other 95% of the stuff is used for evil.


I could live with that, but the reality is that the unproductive people would chase after the productive people after they have all left.


This is so far off from the reality of what happens. Productive people pay at least 50% of their labor to the government. It's not a few hundred dollars, unless you're a college student that doesn't have a job. Sure, i would love the idea of your proposed system if I could have someone else supporting me as I went to college.

of course and that's effectively what happens right now today. You don't see people writing checks to the police and fire departments today, but that is what the tax money is going towards. So we already are paying the bill, the only difference is that we pay the government rather than the police or the fire directly. 


Through insurance or separately is not really the point. We already pay for these services, so the money exists. If we ended government taxation, then we'd effectively have twice as much money as we do today. The other difference would be the logistics of having to write dozens of separate checks to all the different service companies each month, rather than a single check yearly to the government.

it's a false assumption to believe that regulation does only what is advertised (i.e. produce good). Regulation has the potential to give someone an advantage just as much as it's able to remove an advantage.
Your comment was saying "I believe advantages are given and/or removed in a regulated market less often than in an unregulated market".  This doesn't seem true at all. It's the very purpose of a regulation to bestow or remove advantages. 
What you thought you were saying was "the bad guys win less often in a regulated market". This is a matter of perspective. A street drug dealer has disadvantages in a regulated market and a pharmaceutical company has advantages in a regulated market. 
A perfectly unregulated market has very rare advantages or disadvantages given to individuals. The drug dealer and the pharmaceutical company are on equal terms. It's not until the regulators come in do advantages get handed out.

maybe thats just because they benefit you in some way, not that they are logical. Like since you don't smoke marijuana, the current set of regulations don't bother you either way, so you consider it a harmless regulation if not outright good.
