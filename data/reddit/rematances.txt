I never get why that is talked about as a special property of bitcoin, every currency does that. There is no modern currency that can't deal with buying at sub cent levels.

Yes, it would be the same for any currency when a much bigger market is buying from a much smaller market. It would not work if the russians tried to adopt any small country's currency.

That is correct, gold wouldn't really work to move into a new market of equal or greater size than the entire current market.

And yet:

Buy back the bitcoin. Bitcoin has 500,000 or so users, they could sell to the 500,000 or so russians and then when the russians bought eggs or weasels or euros or dog dishes or whatever you can name they'd need SOMEONE that took the bitcoin. Which as bitcoin only has 500,000 users right now would mean either those users buying back exactly what they sold but at a huge loss or some new third thing that would take the bitcoins and give back euros or dollars or frog eggs or whatever it is russians buy.

That doesn't really help at all. That has really nothing to do with anything. The issue isn't that we'd run out of bitcoin, the issue is that a large buy of any sort would then become worthless and useless until someone else was willing to make an equal or larger sized buy.
