E.g.: If price rises 1%, coin holdings at every address decreases by 1%.

Maybe you should make a comment macro that actually helps instead of repeating the same retarded comment every fucking single day?

No they didn't.


No, they have lost of a lot of time and money.

To troll you.

A new elated user that thinks he found a get-rich-quick scheme might be sobered up a little bit to hear from a bitcoin enthusiast "only invest what you can lose" or the equivalent "don't put in your entire life savings".
Remember, some users *actually have* put their entire live savings, plus borrowed everything they could from credit cards to invest (recall the guy that bought $30k worth using mostly debt some months back).
I guess you're bored of the repetition more than you actually have a problem with the phrasing.
It's not important that it's obvious, it's important that users are reminded that this is obvious. People forget/ignore obvious facts all the time.

By "inflation" I meant inflation of the money supply (as is often the implied meaning in this subreddit), not inflation of prices. Inflating the money supply reduces the purchasing power of a unit of that currency whose money supply was inflated. Deflation of the money supply does the opposite. These are the tools you can use to fix the price of a currency.
I am not talking about changing the price of goods. I am talking about changing the price of a currency unit. No offense, but please think about your reply for a bit before continuing. The concept here is relatively simple and very doable in a decentralized currency.

It's about time that you felt the fear of the downvote.

I don't think that meme means what you think it means.

It would probably be more clear to say that "you do not get *all* of your original bet back *due to fees*". You do get most of your original bet back.
How much you get back depends on fees, and fees increase over time to reward early betters.

What do you mean "not even"? Governments have far more limitations than a coin that you create (that does anything you program it to do).
For example you could expand and contract the supply precisely in coordination with US dollar price information as reported by a specific source or set of sources.
This would tie the price to the US dollar.

It is "stealing" in the same way that inflation steals purchasing power from the owners.
Keep in mind that owners of this coin would agree and understand that their coin supply would expand/contract, before buying these coins though. A steady value of their coin is exactly what they are looking for.
But yes, reducing coin holdings of every address by 1% when the price falls by 1% is one way that the supply could be controlled. There are other less distributed ways of course.
