Ok then why did I get one and only have maybe 20 trades in 17-18. With total amount of 9k with a $500 loss , I think every one got a letter im loosing m9ney not mak8ng

all these letters are from coinbase i think , and if you buy and send out to a hardware wallet it counts as a sale to coinbase therfore its a wash , even loss due to fees , but you have the coin in hardware wallet , then why you sell you have to keep records of what you paid for it so you can deduct the value

ya i got one to today , upon checking my coinbase account what i bought and sent out is acctually a loss of 5 dollars , so do you ammend your taxes to refelt the loss ?  of only 5 dollars ?  i dodnt think they have evey trade from coinbase or it would state in the letter how much you own them , dont understand , ill make theem happy and ammend the taxes to reflet my loss of 5 dollars ,

when you do transfer out your bitcoin, my question is if you buy say 10k worth of btc and transfer out to your personal wallet does cash app send you a 1099b or only when you sell through the app and not if if transfrer out ?
@_date: 2019-06-11 23:34:41
another words do they send you a 1099b if you just buy and not sell
@_date: 2019-06-11 23:33:57
i know that i was wondering if you buy through the cash app and send it out do they count that as a sale
@_date: 2019-06-11 23:56:13
thanks , great place to buy bitcoin and for resonable markup i wish they add other crypto soon

Also I'm taking like me if you buy 10k in bit coin you always move it out of coinbase when you buy because it counts as a sale and a wash as far as gains
