There's more than one version of PoS. Some of the older criticisms don't really apply to newer versions.
In Casper, you bet part of your stake that a block will be accepted by the network. That bet earns you money in any chain that includes the block, and loses you money in any chain that doesn't include the block. Once it all settles to a finalized majority chain your bet is resolved.
Mining on top of a block is also a bet that the block will be accepted; if you bet wrong, you lose your expected reward for that block (i.e. the block reward times your percentage of total mining power). 
In mining there's also a physical cost, instead of just the loss of tokens. But the token price drives the total amount of mining people can afford to do, so effectively it's not all that different. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:19:54
That's not what you're betting on. You literally have a collection of proposed blocks and bet on which will be accepted by everyone else (where "accepted" means "the most stake bets for it"). You start with low-confidence bets that don't risk much stake, see what everybody else does, and progress to high-confidence bets that pay off better.
In the [latest]( Casper version, every twelve hours 80 new validators are chosen, and they work in parallel, each generating a block for the same set of transactions. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a small reward for actually doing the validation, just so it's worthwhile, but mainly you're paid by betting on the winning blocks, rather than by being a validator.
The random function isn't really vulnerable to hash grinding anyway: iirc, each staker, upon committing funds, generates a chain of enough hashes to last for the four-month staking period, and works backwards through them; all are XORd to get the next random number.

And in fact, here's the whole scheme in a one-page smart [contract]( (which even if you don't care about Ethereum, I think is useful for seeing how the scheme works).
@_date: 2016-08-01 12:35:06
There's an Ethereum contract which checked the DarkDAO balance after the fork, and set a bit: true if on fork chain, false if on original chain. Once set, this bit can't be changed.
Now any other contract can check that bit to see which chain its on. The standard split method is to send ether to another contract, which checks which chain it's on, and throws an exception (invalidating the transaction) if it's on the wrong chain.
There's a proposal to extend the transaction format, allowing it to include a recent block hash which has to match for the transaction to be valid.
@_date: 2016-08-02 11:20:24
You can pay stakers with transaction fees instead of inflation, just like with PoW.
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:41:08
The stakegrinder cannot create thousands of wallets and enroll them all, for several reasons, starting with a fairly large minimum ether to qualify as a staker. There's also a limited number of stakers, and the lottery I mentioned to choose them from the candidates.
And again, even if you could grind, it wouldn't be profitable, because *you don't get rewarded when the block you made is chosen*. It's entirely unlike PoW in this way.
What we're seeing now is the thought process that comes before the whitepaper's written. Everything new starts out this way, whether it's done in public or not.
@_date: 2016-08-02 13:51:31
The latest Casper design I've seen targets 4000 validators. They've been working to make that number as high as possible but scalability is an issue; the bets of all the validators have to be included in the chain. They've hinted that trustless stake pooling may be possible.
Bets are weighted by the amount of stake and by a confidence factor that you set. A higher-confidence bet has more risk of loss, more reward if you're right, and more influence on the decision.
You start with a low-confidence bet, then you look to see how everybody else bet, and increase your confidence. As everyone does this, it all converges on a final decision.
Between two equally-valid blocks, you just pick one, at lowest confidence, then adjust to whatever randomly came out a little further ahead.
(By "you" of course I mean the client software does it, automatically.)
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:49:15
By "everyone" I meant all active stakers. To be a staker you first have to lock up your stake for four months, and be selected by lottery if more than the maximum number wish to stake.
The linked hashes go backwards, not forward. People reveal a preimage, and they're XOR'd. Then on the next round, people reveal the preimage of that preimage. Unless you can break the cryptographic hash algorithm, you can't grind it. And if you can break the hash, the whole blockchain fails anyway. (I don't have a checkable source for the algorithm though, so I may be incorrect about some detail.)

Coinbase's removal was entirely political. If you agree with Core's position in the blocksize debate, than you might want to move away from Coinbase to support that position. Other people are moving *to* Coinbase in support of the opposing position. None of it has anything to do with Coinbase's reliability, and if you don't know what all this is about, there's probably no need to worry about it.

@_date: 2015-06-29 04:24:09
Yes, but if we go with Gavin's [IBLT]( idea then those blocks don't actually have to be transmitted. Instead we can send tiny fixed-size structures taking advantage of the fact that miners already have most of the transactions. From a bandwidth perspective Bitcoin could easily go to VISA scale that way even on present-day home broadband.
There's still the disk storage issue but pruning helps, and if people are up for a more radical solution the finite blockchain idea might work.

That just means that for the thief, the cost of the item is the cost of the fee. Either the fee is much lower than the item cost, in which case it doesn't deter fraud at all, or it's a high percentage of item cost, in which case it penalizes honest customers so much that nobody honest will use Bitcoin for these transactions.

@_date: 2015-06-29 18:14:24
I understand how a single channel keeps transactions off the blockchain until settlement. And I understand how the recipient's preimage and hash allow transactions to safely route through intermediaries. 
What I don't understand is how transactions routed through intermediaries stay off the blockchain. If Alice pays Bob through several intermediaries, and Bob cashes in by publishing the preimage, then all the intermediaries have to use that preimage to get those funds.
How is that an improvement over just setting up a microchannel directly between Alice and Bob? You'd get enormous scalability if you could set up A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C, and C-&gt;D, then have each of these links occasionally settle independently of each other. Then A can send all his transactions through B without having to do a separate A-&gt;B settlement for each recipient D. I don't see how Lightning achieves that.

@_date: 2015-12-28 01:52:18


But actually, you don't need more security just because the block is bigger. You need more security if there's more value to protect. The analogy is actually an argument for keeping Bitcoin's market cap from increasing.
...or it would be, except as the price increases, mining increases proportionately. So it's just a silly analogy.
@_date: 2015-06-29 10:48:43
That's what I mean. The miners already get most of the individual transactions, or they couldn't mine. Transactions don't have to be included again in the blocks. 
But this is a major improvement to scalability, rather than a mere 2x improvement as you might expect.
The reason for the low blocksize limit is that block propagation time is proportional to their size. If we had very large blocks, we couldn't propagate them to all nodes within the 10-minute block time.
Remove that problem by using IBLT, and the only network limit is the bandwidth needed to transmit the transactions themselves. In the link I provided, Gavin calculates that you can fit tens of thousands of transactions per second into typical home broadband.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:40:58

To store large amounts for the long term, use a paper wallet in a safe deposit box.
An emerging solution is multisig, where an online service provider holds one key, you hold another key on your computer and the third key in a safe deposit box, and 2 of the 3 keys are needed to complete a transaction. All your coins are convenient to use, but an attacker would have to compromise both the online provider and your own computer. If the online provider goes away, you get the third key out of your safe deposit box.
Multisig transactions also solve consumer protection. Set up a transaction so if buyer and seller are both satisfied, they both sign the transaction and the arbitrator doesn't have to get involved. If there's a dispute, only one party signs the transaction, and the arbitrator decides where the money goes. There's already one startup providing this service.

If people tried to exchange 5% of the dollar for euros, I imagine the dollar/euro exchange rate would take a big hit.
But the alternative isn't just leaving dollars in safes. Mostly, dollars are spent on stuff, not exchanged for other currencies. This is what makes money different from stocks.
The real way to look at it is to use the [velocity of money]( If, say, the average bitcoin changes hands twice a year, the price of the bitcoin is $1 million, and there are 20 million bitcoins, then we've got $20 trillion in transactions divided by 2 for a $10 trillion money supply.

Good: Ripple replaces mining with a much cheaper consensus process.
Bad: It does that by requiring you to pretty much know who all the nodes are. Then you can pick a subset of nodes that you trust to not all collaborate with each other. And that has to be a decent percentage of all nodes. So you're going to have a relatively limited set of well-known nodes, instead of lots of anonymous nodes run by whoever feels like it at the time.
Edit for downvoter: here's the Ripple consensus [paper]( Note that each node has to be connected to 20% of all nodes, unless you know enough about the nodes you're connected to that you can have high confidence they're not collaborating.

True, but researchers doing graph analysis over several months of the blockchain can get a pretty good idea. Here's a [paper](

That's an interesting premise. Would you apply the same to the U.S. dollar? Because I think if you ask most economists what the total value of the U.S. dollar M1 money supply is, in terms of euros, they would simply multiply the number of dollars by the price of each in euros.
@_date: 2014-09-25 18:30:56
It also shrinks the blocks that miners pass around. If you're a miner, you already have most of the transactions, so instead of putting all the transactions in the produced block, a successful miner sends out this little fixed-size data structure. That plus the transactions you already have lets you reconstruct the ones you're missing, most of the time. (For the few times you miss, you just ask somebody for the full block.)
This really helps scalability, because the bigger the blocks, the longer they take to propagate, and the GHOST paper showed that propagation time will limit scaling to a few hundred transactions per second if we want to avoid doublespending attacks. So this fixes things by shrinking the blocks.

@_date: 2014-02-14 13:51:23
It works like this:
Some bitcoin nodes are relaying unconfirmed transactions after altering them, such that the transactions are still valid, but have different hashes.
They're doing this very quickly, so those transactions often get into the blockchain, and the originals are abandoned as doublespend attempts.
Wallets that were looking for the transaction hash, instead of more reliable information they could be looking for, will think the transactions never got into the blockchain, and therefore be willing to send again if you ask. Some people require manual intervention before they'll do this, but SilkRoad2 says their wallet would send again automatically.
So they're claiming that someone asked for resends repeatedly and tricked SR2's wallet into sending more and more bitcoins until they were all gone. It seems to me that it should be verifiable in the blockchain that *someone* did this, though there's no way to prove it wasn't SR2 themselves.
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:43:58
Another way to look at it: dollars used to be backed by gold. Bitcoins are backed by all the other things you can buy with them.
In 2010, someone decided he'd accept bitcoins for pizza. Bitcoins at that point were backed by pizza, two pies for 10,000 coins. And it gradually snowballed from there. "Oh, you want to buy with bitcoins? Well I guess I could buy a pizza with them. Ok." And now they're backed by something else too.
I don't think many people would have predicted that a currency could bootstrap that way. But now it's worked multiple times. You just need a few early adopters willing to accept this new worthless currency in exchange for something else, whether physical goods or a different currency, and you're off to the races.
@_date: 2014-05-08 13:53:54

@_date: 2014-09-25 18:20:02
Well it'll help scaling. The GHOST paper talks about severe scaling limits because block propagation time increases as block size increases. To prevent doublespending attacks you can't let block propagation get too slow.
So this shrinks the transmitted block, speeding up propagation, because people already have most of the transactions, and this little fixed-size structure combined with the transactions they already have lets them reconstruct whatever transactions they're missing.
So it fixes one limit to scaling, and of course the things you mention fix other limitations.

That's not exactly the case. Every bitcoin transaction has one or more inputs from specific other transactions. So MtGox could be matching by the set of transactionid/amount pairs that they created for that transaction, along with the destination and timestamp. This should be plenty to be reliably unique, and their own wallet software should be keeping track of all that anyway, and could make sure it's unique.
MtGox wrote their own wallet software, which happens to be using the transaction hash to see whether a transaction was accepted by the network, and that's why they ran into trouble. They should have known better, because this has been a documented issue with the bitcoin protocol for a while now.
The  [reason]( the flaw happened is that:

True but 2013 investors generally expected transaction rates to increase enough to keep pace. 
If investors think a company is going to have 20% greater sales after a year and it only manages 15%, the stock price will go down.  I suppose you could just stick with that explanation without bringing in the known inflation rate, but it's worth pointing out that bitcoin does dilute its stock and therefore must grow to keep pace. If investors believe it will grow that much, they'll invest, but the expected growth has to be higher than if there were no dilution.

But they think the reason for that is that once you get to that energy level, you get so much impurities in the plasma boiled off the electrodes that it interferes with compression. They've found that their own plasma mass is over a third copper and silver. They're attacking that problem with tungsten electrodes (already ordered), and in a different way with the beryllium electrodes they're crowdfunding. They will be the first plasma focus experiment to try either. It could be that their hypothesis is wrong, but it seems worth checking.
Their [paper]( did show that they've attained record plasma *temperature* at 1.8 billion degrees, which is hot enough for boron fusion. They also showed that the fusion is sufficiently confined.

If there's a lot of trouble with seller fraud, people will use services like [bitrated](
The transaction goes through if it is signed by any two of three people...the buyer, the seller, or the third-party arbitrator. The third party never has access to the money, and if buyer and seller are both happy he doesn't get involved at all. This is a pretty significant improvement over traditional escrow services.

Comparing to general-purpose supercomputers isn't that relevant. The NSA probably had lots of SHA-256 ASICs already, just for cracking passwords. I wouldn't be surprised if they had their own chip fab churning them out, or a secret contract with Intel. 
Can anybody here guess how much money the makers of bitcoin ASICs have spent so far? I suspect a comparison to the NSA's budget would be unsettling.
And the thing about it is...they wouldn't have to join a pool. If they directly control lots of hashing power, they could look like they're just a bunch of solo miners.
They might not attack, either. Maybe they'd rather just keep the rewards, and have a nice juicy funding source that Congress can't cut.

Another argument: if deflation makes people put off their purchases because they can get more for their money later, then why did the computer industry do so well when computers were getting dramatically better every year?
I think the only real problem with deflation is when it's caused by too much debt in a debt-backed currency. People pay off their loans, that shrinks the money supply, and that makes it harder to pay off loans. Doesn't apply to bitcoin at all.
And even if deflation were a bad thing, it would only be a problem with bitcoin if it were the only cryptocurrency allowed. What we are actually creating is what Hayek advocated: a system of multiple privately-backed currencies, which he thought would naturally stabilize without any need for central control.

An interbank settlement would be a pretty high-value transaction. They don't have to do it for every transaction they process, they just have to exchange the net of a large number of transactions. Any transaction fee would be minuscule by comparison.
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:20:12
Eh, no. What I'm saying is, if you want to use a blockchain for interbank settlement, it doesn't make sense to use a proof-of-work blockchain at all. More traditional consensus algorithms like Byzantine Paxos work just fine and much more efficiently.
If the banks wanted to use the Bitcoin network for settlement transactions, they could easily outbid everybody else on fees.

Yes and as people share their knowledge of intermediate hubs, the more popular ones will get bigger faster. The "rich get richer" effect will kick in, and just like most other networks we'll have a power law, with a few huge hubs that everyone uses, and most intermediate nodes being much smaller. 
If it's cheapest or fastest to minimize the number of hops, then the large hubs will take almost all the traffic. But even if that's not a factor, we'll still have a power law.

Interbank settlement takes days. If there's a way the banks can use blockchains to reduce that to minutes, more power to 'em. That doesn't mean they're trying to replace public trust-free blockchains.
Bitcoin is a breakthrough because there's no counterparty risk, and it works even when you don't know who everybody is. Banks are tracking off-chain assets like fiat, where counterparty risk is unavoidable, and they're working with known semi-trusted entities. It makes sense for them to use software that's designed for those requirements.

Everything uses *some* energy, but how much? The article only showed that the total financial cost of proof-of-work will rise to equal the block reward. Part of that cost is the amortized capital expense of mining equipment. This is not equivalent to energy, since different products require different amounts of energy to for a given economic value.
It seems likely that the total energy consumed to create mining equipment is less than if the purchase price were used entirely for electricity, which means if miners buy more expensive equipment that uses less energy, Bitcoin's total energy expense will drop. Or if the waste heat from the chip is used to heat your house, the mining cost will be almost entirely capital.

It's a tragedy-of-the-commons situation.
It's in the interest of all miners to keep fees high. But the actions of an individual miner will have little effect on the overall market, so it's in the individual's interest to take all the transactions available that have any fees at all. Therefore the fees will be low because if you pay anything, you'll get into the blockchain.
This is a recognized problem, see [here]( But it's not really a problem until the block reward is too low to fund sufficient security.

Ether is fuel for Ethereum in exactly the same way bitcoins are fuel for Bitcoin. It's used to pay transaction fees and rewarded to miners.

I wonder how it would affect the overall system, to have different bitcoins worth different amounts depending on their colors. Perhaps just that some colors could afford higher transaction fees.
I think the people who told you the blockchain is unnecessary with backed/issued currency are missing the point...the blockchain still gives a way to reliably track transactions, without having to rely on the central issuer for every transfer of ownership.
What about currency exchange? With colored bitcoins in one blockchain it's partly built in. We'd need some way within the system to set up a two-way transaction, where for example I give you three red bitcoins in exchange for your four blue bitcoins. If we can do that in one transaction, with colored inputs and outputs, that only goes through once we both sign it, it could work out really nicely.

With plurality voting, you can just transfer your marked bitcoin to the guy you're voting for. How would you implement IRV?
If you're going to make the effort, I'd recommend range voting or approval voting over IRV. Every country with IRV still has two-party dominance, and there are situations under IRV where you can damage your favored candidate by voting for him. For details, see [rangevoting.org]( which incidentally also has some information on [secure voting protocols](
You could potentially handle anonymity by tracking for each person that they received a ballot (ie. coin), but not which one they received. Preventing vote selling could be more difficult than with most systems, given the public ledger. If you can figure out a way to manage that you'll really have something.
(On the other hand, I've seen proposals for direct democracy in which you'd be able to delegate your vote to other people who specialize in various topics. A bitcoin protocol could be ideal for that.)
Edit: I guess you could implement any form of voting by simply including all the ballot information as part of the transaction. Within each jurisdiction, issue each voter an anonymous coin/ballot showing all the candidates he can vote for. The transaction goes to the vote counter, not to the candidate.

I don't know much about colored bitcoins but what you're talking about sounds a lot like [OpenTransactions]( at least in spirit.
Here's an [account]( by one of the people involved of issuing a tradeable "currency" from his company that could be redeemed in the company's product. They did this instead of getting a bank loan, and it worked out really well.
(Another redditor recently mentioned to me that he's working on integrating OpenTransactions with bitcoin. It seems to me that something like this could fix the scaling issues bitcoin would run into if it turned into a major currency. But that would still be a fixed money supply.)
On the general economic issue: the thing that Keynes pointed out and Austrian economists ignore is that wages are "sticky." People don't like their wages going down, even if prices are going down too. It's kinda silly but that's how people think, maybe because your own wage is easy to measure and overall average prices are not. So most companies will lay people off before reducing their wages. Lay people off, and the remainder will work hard to avoid being next. Reduce everybody's wages and everybody just gets pissed off.

Is this right: your useful calculation is replacing bitcoin's cryptographic hash, but it's still using transaction blocks as input, which works because it's used for problems where you test a lot of random solutions. The transactions become the seeds for a pseudo-random number generator.
Blocks are created like now, by having the random numbers meet an arbitrary numerical test, but the calculated solution is included and the best of each ten gets awarded coins.

Actually bitcoin itself can be used to establish media ownership, at least for new works. An idea from the forum: the artist starts by taking a secure hash of his new file, and then submits a transaction to the network, addressed to that hash. It's not a real bitcoin address, so any coin left over after the transaction fee would be lost...make it a very small amount or zero if possible.
But now, you've got a timestamped hash of the file in the blockchain, tied to a real bitcoin address (the transaction sender) whom you presume to be the owner. The owner can now release the file.
At this point, anyone can easily find the earliest timestamp of the file, and make a bitcoin donation to the associated bitcoin address.
This system does depend on donations, but the average musician makes under fifty cents from a CD sale...if the average person is willing to donate fifty cents for an *entire album*, the musician comes out ahead. Experiments so far suggest that many people would be more than willing to do that.
The musician could post his bitcoin address on his website, allowing anyone to google it and find him.
If simple donation is insufficient, the artist could release a partial or low quality file, and release the real file once sufficient donations are collected. Bitcoin contracts could help with this.
Either way, it's in the artist's interest for people to distribute his files as widely as possible. Released files are advertisements for future works, and people donate to encourage him to keep working.

I ask because that was the prosecution's argument.  Personally I think there's a real possibility of the person forgetting the password, in all the excitement of arrest and jail and whatnot, so unless we're going to keep people in prison indefinitely for "contempt" after they forget, we'd better take the Fifth on this one.
Another issue on this case was that the prosecution didn't know what files were on the drive. They just had a bunch of random data, which Truecrypt writes automatically. There was another case where the police saw the files before they were re-encrypted, and in that case the person had to decrypt.

"The core Bitcoin network can scale to very high transaction rates assuming a distributed version of the node software is built. This would not be very complicated."
Building distributed versions of things typically isn't that simple.
I wish they'd get on with it. Last I heard they were leaving scalability for later while they focus on applications.
The flaw in that thinking is that some applications are only possible given massive scalability. For example, we could use the blockchain as a timestamp service to both establish copyright, and make it easy to donate small amounts to copyright owners.
This is an application that no other payment system can manage. Being able to do things like that would be a huge competitive advantage for bitcoin, but we have to be able to handle very large numbers of tiny transactions.
@_date: 2012-02-05 20:13:50
Not if you consider that an adversary can change the order of transactions, if he can apply more computation than you.
If you can figure out another method of putting transactions in order, which is resistant to attack, decentralized, and doesn't require proof of doing more work than the attacker, then by all means, publish your design and we'll probably migrate to it. 
@_date: 2012-05-17 20:04:42
Bitcoin is definitely worthwhile, but I'll mention two caveats:
- Your coins *can* potentially be tracked. If your coins have some contact with a real-world bank account (because you bought them on an exchange) or physical address (if buying stuff that gets shipped to you), they can be linked to your real identity. There are steps you can take, but some researchers recently were pretty successful at tracking things down. Bear in mind that all transactions go on a public ledger.
- To really change the world, bitcoins would have to emerge as a major currency, and that implies a level of scalability that isn't implemented yet. There are ideas, but they're not yet proven. Every full peer sees every transaction. (Some people claim it's not an issue, but if you propose an application that involves a large number of small transactions you'll get a lot of complaints.)
That said, it's working right now and bitcoins are worth real money.
@_date: 2012-10-22 00:17:51
Seems to me the main impediment is scalability. 
One part of this is the block chain. Every full peer has to download the entire history of all transactions to get started. They seem to be figuring this part out, compressing the history of dead transactions.
The other part is that all transactions are broadcast to everybody. I don't think anyone has figured out a way around that. We can scale up quite a bit higher than where we're at right now, but there's going to be a limit.  (For anyone who doubts this, try proposing a new use for the block chain that will introduce lots of small transactions, and find out how much people complain.)
Perhaps we'll end up with full peers essentially functioning like banks, consolidating transactions and trading net amounts with other peers, with normal users having accounts with particular peers and essentially writing checks to other users. Not nearly as satisfying but if the scaling hits a wall it'd keep us moving forward.
Caveat: historically I've worried way too much about scalability. It's what kept me from getting in when I first read about bitcoin in 2009. 
@_date: 2012-12-21 18:31:57
There are already viruses that encrypt your files, demanding payment to decrypt them. A fully-anonymous currency would make that even easier.
So I'd say, profitable and inevitable, at least for the first two. There's still some risk for meatspace crimes but this would definitely reduce it.
I think most likely it won't happen before the currency is too widespread to stop, unless someone does something so horrific that everyone quits voluntarily.

Tree: you find a block, I find a block, both with the same parent block. This happens in Bitcoin and forms a very short-lived fork. That's a tree.
Bitcoin resolves forking by choosing the block with the longest branch after it.
GHOST resolves forking by choosing the block with the heaviest subtree; ie., the most total proof-of-work descending from it.
This is the only difference. Both methods have short-lived branching and both resolve after a little while to a linear chain.

That's ignoring the public goods problem. For any given miner, the economic reward of his personal contribution to Bitcoin's overall security is less than the economic loss to the miner. Each potential miner hopes everybody mines, but is better off not mining himself.
Bitcoin solves the public goods problem by rewarding miners with coins. If mining stops being profitable, miners quit.
If the public goods problem weren't a real thing, we wouldn't need mining rewards in the first place, we wouldn't need taxes, and we would have already solved climate change.
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:30:38
Yes, but the idea is that a miner sees his own mined block right away, and other miners only see it after propagation delays. A very large miner (such as a pool) has a higher proportion of blocks it gets to see right away, so it gets a head start more often. This make it more profitable in proportion to its hash rate. The extra profitability helps compensate for fees.
Ethereum mitigates the problem by using GHOST and paying rewards for orphaned blocks, so whether it really has this problem might be an open question. Based on the comments by DirtyPolecat and 3rdElement, it might just be that running a solo miner is too much hassle at the moment.

Check out the paper [Accelerating Bitcoin’s Transaction Processing: Fast Money Grows on Trees, Not Chains]( (pdf), which addresses two of those things and was published in 2013. Ethereum's blockchain is based on this paper. It does collapse to a linear chain after the most recent transactions.

I don't see how what you said is any different. You're talking at the level of individual nodes, I'm talking about the long-term consensus. A bitcoin node works on the longest chain it sees, but if a longer one comes along that it hadn't seen before, it'll switch to that. That's how the Bitcoin network reaches consensus. GHOST works exactly the same way, except for a slightly different definition of "longest."
What I'm talking about here is just the paper I linked, not the scalability stuff the OP linked, which won't appear in Ethereum's first release.

Your first paragraph is similar to something I've been thinking: that if you print a hundred trillion dollars, but people bury 99% of it in their backyards, you don't get inflation. The trillion in circulation is all that matters. But if people look at the value of those dollars in circulation, multiply by their holdings and think they're rich, they're in for a surprise, unless they're quick enough to get rid of it before everybody else does.
Right now, most people have their bitcoins buried in their backyards.
As for the reason for people to use bitcoins: I think the biggest is that it's so easy to accept it. Anyone can spend money online, but setting up a way to receive it is harder. You can go with Paypal, but they have an unpleasant history of freezing people's accounts. With bitcoins you just post your key anywhere and people can send you money, and there's no third party who can interfere.

The private key is 256 bits, an address is only 160. So this could definitely be done.

That's a great description of a simple micropayment channel. When one user knows he's going to make lots of small payments to another user, they can set up a channel and do most of them off-chain, and it's still trustless because the recipient can redeem on-chain at any time. No intermediaries required.
LN generalizes that so you can use it for all payments, not just repeated payments to the same person. Doing that requires intermediate nodes and a lot of complexity, and that's the part some people worry about.

Their PoW is designed to be resistant to ASICs, but I don't remember any measures against mining pools.

See page two of the [bitcoin paper](
Or trust my summary: a bitcoin is a chain of digital signatures. It is born containing the public key of the owner. The owner transfers it by adding the public key of the recipient, and signing it with his own private key. The recipient can validate the transfer just by checking the signatures. No access to the network is necessary.
What the recipient can't verify offline is whether the sender double-spent the coin. Preventing doublespends is the purpose of the block chain.
@_date: 2011-06-02 15:28:38
The miners are putting the transactions in a particular order that everyone agrees on, so if anyone double-spends, we can all agree on who got the coins first and gets to keep them.

Since it's a digital currency, you need some way to prevent people from just making multiple copies of the computer files making up the coins. Until now, that's always required a central authority.
Bitcoin handles it by making all transactions public. Miners are putting bitcoin transactions in a definite order, so if anyone tries to spend a coin more than once, everyone can agree who got it first and therefore keeps it. Doing this takes a lot of computation, by design, so it's hard for attackers to compete. This is necessary work for bitcoin to function. Since it's expensive, miners are awarded new coins to pay for it.
So there's a limited supply, and there's demand for them because people are fed up with the restrictions of other online payment methods.

They're putting a global list of all bitcoin transactions in a certain order that everyone agrees on, so if anyone double-spends a coin, everyone knows who got it first (and thus gets to keep it).
They're doing that by making a chain of hashed transaction blocks. Specifically, they try out a bunch of random numbers such that hash(transactionBlock + previousHash + randomNumber) starts with a specified number of zeros. An attacker wishing to subvert the transaction history would have to redo a whole lot of computation.
In exchange for doing this work, anyone who successfully completes a block gets to award himself some bitcoins. The new bitcoins are part of the transaction block.

Wow. I'd thought about building a website that implements assurance contracts and takes bitcoin. Now it turns out bitcoin can do the same thing all by itself. Very cool.
Edit: it does still require a server for assurance contracts: "The transaction is uploaded to the entrepreneur's server, which saves it to disk and updates its count of how many coins have been pledged."
It's just easy to implement since bitcoin handles the details, and you don't need a trusted intermediary to hold the money. (Of course you do still have to trust the entrepreneur to do what he said, after the goal is reached.)

The mining already does something useful: it puts the transactions in a universally-agreed order, so if coins are doublespent, everyone will agree who got them first. This is necessary for a functioning currency.
Doing that in a way that prevents people from spoofing it takes a lot of computation, with the transactions themselves as the input. Awarding coins for mining is just the incentive for doing that work.

Power-efficient but expensive specialized hardware could reduce that significantly though. And I didn't take transaction fees into account, I'll have to think about that a bit.
Edit: transaction fees make it worse.
My estimate is based on the idea that people will be willing to spend an amount of money to generate bitcoins, up to the reward they can get from it. Transaction fees add to the reward, so people will be willing to spend even more resources to generate blocks. Other factors stay the same - total number of bitcoins and new bitcoins created per block are on a schedule.
Things change when transaction fees become the only reward, but that's not until 2040.

There's a famous thread on the forums, about a year ago, where someone said "I will pay 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza." And somebody got him a pizza. He thought it was amazingly cool that he managed to buy a pizza with those little digital coins he made on his computer.
Gradually, more and more people did stuff like that. As more people started using bitcoins, their value increased, because demand was up and the supply was limited.
Another factor is people looking ahead. They figure if this process continues, and bitcoins become a really significant currency, demand will be up a *lot* and supply won't have increased all that much. So part of the value of bitcoins is from people expecting them to be worth more a few years from now. That expectation has helped drive adoption, giving people an incentive to invest early before there's much demand. 
But the real foundation of their value is just that a lot of people want a currency that lets them easily make or accept payments, that can't be controlled, that's protected from inflation, and that provides a modest level of anonymity. With a market demand and a limited supply, a price on bitcoins is the inevitable result.

Paying people in bitcoins in exchange for devoting computing resources to SETI computation...that's a really great idea. 
The neatest part is it's probably impractical with anything other than bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-11 23:07:16
Hmm, I think there are ways it can be considered overvalued.
For example, if 99 percent of bitcoins are hoarded, and lots of people are trying to buy new bitcoins, the value of the small remainder available for purchase is going to go up due to limited supply. But if all the hoarders tried to sell, they would quickly find that their holdings weren't worth as much as they thought.
So far starters, I'd say the real value of the currency is not the price, it's the sum of what people are willing to exchange for it, divided by the sum of all the currency (rather than by the sum of currency currently offered for exchange). Or at least, that's the case unless you expect people to hoard all that currency forever.
Given bitcoin's deflation, people's expectation of appreciation gives the currency a present value higher than that. But if those expectations are overly exuberant, the currency is overvalued because people expect faster appreciation than will actually occur.
On the other hand, if you're convinced that bitcoins will become currency as big as the dollar, which would give each coin a value of about $100K, it's hard to escape the conclusion that they're drastically undervalued.

Lower prices tend to result in higher sales, which makes it nontrivial to decide on the right price in the first place. So if I were a game developer I'd probably just set the price and not worry about it as long as it stays in a decent general range most of the time.
It's not like selling games online is a steady predictable income in any case. If I'm selling more when bitcoins are lower, it probably averages out well enough.

$50 trillion is pretty much the global money supply. $10 trillion is the total U.S. dollar M3 supply. Arguably Bitcoin should be compared to the amount of government-issued currency, ignoring the multiplier effect of fractional reserve banking, which takes us down to about $1 trillion.
Australia would hold a fraction of those dollars, but if we're saying "sixth largest reserve currency" we actually ought to compare to the [supply]( of Australian dollars, which is $200 billion for M1 and only about $50 billion for actual currency. Using the latter, Bitcoin would have about a factor of 10 to grow from here.

There was a case kinda relevant to this several years back. A business paid its employees in U.S. Golden Eagle coins. Since these are legal tender, it argued that it was valid to report taxes based on the face value of the coins, rather than the (much higher) bullion value. Just as if it paid employees in pennies, it wouldn't have to calculate the metal value of the copper.
Iirc, they won the initial case but the government appealed and got them in the end. Bitcoins, of course, lack even the legal tender argument.

Not that easy. A coin transfer has to be cryptographically signed with the current owner's public key. The coin itself is a chain of signatures reaching back to its creation. If you take over the network, the only coins you can steal are those that you owned before at some point...and fairly recently, or you have to recompute a lot of history. It'd take more than 75% of the network to do much of that.

It doesn't generate small portions of a bitcoin until it finally completes one. It's trying a bunch of random numbers until it finds one that meets certain criteria, and then boom, you've got fifty coins. Until it finds that number you've got nothing.
The work it's doing, basically, is helping to generate a global list of transactions in a verified and agreed-upon order, so that if anyone double-spends a coin, everybody will agree on who got it first (and thus gets to keep it). The new coins are your incentive for doing that work.

The inverted bloom filter lets a miner reconstruct the whole block, but only because he already has most of the transactions, and can use them plus the bloom filter to reconstruct the actual block.
But the bloom filter doesn't give you any information unless you have those transactions. So for storage, you might as well store the whole block.
To fix storage, I think the current idea is to prune old spent addresses. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:41:45
Yes, we can scale to VISA levels. [Here's how]( by converting the blocks to small fixed-size structures that let miners reconstruct blocks from the transactions they already have. Typical home-bandwidth speed can easily support tens of thousands of transactions per second that way. (We'll also need to prune long-term storage of course.)
@_date: 2016-05-19 22:38:04
Didn't know that, thanks. Wasn't intending to recommend them, just to answer the question.
@_date: 2011-05-18 18:18:35
Actually the problem being solved is to resolve conflicts if someone double-spends coins.
Basically, the transactions are all public, and each miner is doing computation that puts them in a definite order. If a coin is spent twice, the first recipient wins.
The computation takes a long time to do, but a very short time to check afterwards, so it's easy to validate, but difficult for someone to forge without using enormous resources.
I can't think of any way a protein folding computation could accomplish the same purpose, but maybe something like that could work. But it has to somehow include the transactions in the computation.

@_date: 2015-02-11 22:04:24
There are a couple scalability improvements that should be put in place before doing it. One is to simply prune old empty addresses so blockchain storage doesn't get too huge.
Also, there's a scalability limit due to the time it takes to propagate large blocks. A fix they're working on right now is a neat [trick]( so miners can send just a small bit of information from a solved block, which is fixed-size, and has just enough data so other miners can reconstruct the solved block using the transactions they already have. (If they're missing a few that's ok, if they're missing a lot they can just ask for the full block.) Last I saw, Gavin was working on this, and it would let Bitcoin easily scale past VISA-level transaction rates.
This is not to say they couldn't easy up a little bit before then, but I bet they want the changes in place so we don't need two hard forks. In the meantime, offchain transactions via Coinbase and whatnot could fill the gap.

This new idea still ends up with a linear chain. The difference is in how it picks which blocks go into the chain.

This way the abandoned blocks contribute to the security of the chain, even though their transactions aren't actually considered part of the chain.

The main threat to SHA-256 would be someone finding a cryptographic flaw. Brute force is out of the question with any hardware, including quantum computers, which would only effectively reduce the hash size to 128 bits, still plenty.
The public key encryption is another matter, quantum computers could crack that wide open. Changing public key algorithms would be easier than changing the hash algorithm, but until it's done people would be at risk of getting coins stolen when they spend.

Each bitcoin address has its own public and private key. The address is the hash of the public key. When the user spends from that address, he signs the transaction with the private key, and reveals the public key. People can hash the public key to make sure it matches the address, and use the public key to check the signature.
Typically remaining funds are transferred to a new address.
To break it down a bit more, for anyone not familiar: the way public/private keys work is, they come in pairs, and you can encrypt with either one and decrypt with the other.
This comes in handy for encrypted messages, because you can publish your public key to everyone, and anyone can encrypt with your public key, and only you can decrypt since only you have the private key.
It works in the opposite direction for signatures. If you encrypt something with your private key, then everyone can use your public key to decrypt it. They know it must have been you who encrypted, since only you have the private key which matches the public key everyone knows is yours.
(For efficiency, people actually take a hash of the data and encrypt that. Same principle though.)

Bitcoins are always worth more tomorrow too.
Both systems grow more rapidly in the early days. PPC uses proof-of-work to distribute coins for a while, since the only alternative is for the developer to just hand them out. The proof-of-work reward gradually phases out, like it does for BTC.
In the end, BTC caps at 21 million while PPC keeps growing 1%/year. It'll still be deflationary if the economy grows more than that, but less so than BTC.
The big advantages for PPC: low energy usage, and consequently low transaction fees, without risk of that opening you up to a 51% attack. Bitcoin, I think, has only two paths once mining rewards drop to a low level and the price stabilizes: either raise transaction fees to a significant level, possibly several percent, or suffer attack.

Before it could happen, people would have to be using bitcoin-backed "checking accounts" and doing mostly offchain transactions.
This could end up happening for scalability reasons. It's a bit hard to imagine the blockchain handling as many transactions as the U.S. dollar. But if most transactions are offchain, and blockchain transactions are used mostly by service providers to periodically settle balances between themselves, bitcoin could easily scale as large as the dollar.

Simple answer: it prevents people from spending the same coins twice.
The blocks make up a big public ledger of all bitcoin transactions. Since it's so hard to create "solved" blocks, it's practically impossible to fake them. You'd need more computing power than the rest of the miners combined, since they're all working together.

I think that ultimately, Bitcoin can't reach major-currency status without some degree of centralization. You're not going to have full nodes viewing every transaction, if there are as many transactions as the U.S. dollar has.
A fix would be for most people to have digital checking accounts with Bitcoin "banks," where a bank is simply a full node that maintains your account balance, holds bitcoins, and periodically uses them to settle accounts with other banks. That way actual transactions are aggregated into interbank settlements.
To be clear, I don't mean actual regulated banks, just full nodes with enough reputation to be trusted, like online wallets are today. Anyone who wished could still participate as a full node, and the market and physical limits would determine the total number of full nodes and transactions.
Other people would use Ripple or OpenTransactions clients to talk to their "banks," which would have everything transparent and cryptographically validated.
This is the only way I think Bitcoin could reach, say, a trillion-dollar valuation. It has its downsides, but I like the upside of turning Bitcoin into something that most people in the world can use as their primary currency.

Mining isn't arbitrary. It has to do three things for Bitcoin to work:
- It has to take a block of recent transactions as an input to the function
- It has to be cryptographically secure, meaning there's no way for someone to figure out a different input that will produce the same output
- It has to be too difficult for attackers to mine more than the rest of the network combined
These properties allow Bitcoin to make a secure transaction history that everyone agrees upon, and therefore to prevent doublespending attacks. Cryptographic hashes have these properties, seti doesn't.
That said, since Bitcoin was introduced there have been newer [proposals]( to accomplish the same thing in a less compute-intensive way, and one [project]( has released code.

This is true with mining rewards. But those will ultimately be replaced with transaction fees. It's not clear to me that transaction fees will serve so well.
It would help if we keep the block size small, so there's scarcity of transactions. Then the transaction fees may rise enough to protect the network. If transactions are not scarce, any miner has an incentive to accept all transactions, no matter how small the fees, since otherwise he's just leaving money on the table. Fees are then likely to drop to a low level, possibly insufficient to prevent successful attack.
I'm [not the first]( to think of this. Proof-of-stake seems like the best solution to me. It would drop energy consumption and transaction fees to a miniscule level.

It does make it faster. Since you're not throwing away the work that went into side branches, you add security to the chain more quickly.

Using less energy in absolute terms doesn't make a difference. But what does make a difference is a lower ratio of energy to mining hardware cost.
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:34:18
On top of that, having some transaction scarcity to drive transaction fees might help ensure there's enough money for mining to prevent 51% attack, after the mining rewards drop in half a few more times.

There are some alternative fusion projects that look promising near-term. I wrote up a bunch of them [here](
My favorite is focus fusion. If it works, it'd be nonradioactive 5MW reactors ten times cheaper than fossil, and would decentralize our energy supply very quickly. 
They published a paper last year in the top fusion journal *Physics of Plasmas*. They've got another year of experiments to scale up to an attempt at producing net power. 
They've spent $3 million so far from private investors, and are planning a million-dollar crowdfund early next year to finish the experiment.

I'd be a little worried about the doublespending attack on sdice.
Sdice sends back your winnings immediately, without waiting for your transaction to clear. That should be fine because their transaction to you includes the coin you sent to them, so if your transaction fails, so will theirs.
However, if upon losing you were to immediately spend the same bitcoin again, to a different recipient, there'd be close to a 50% chance that your second transaction will be confirmed first. Then you only pay sdice half as often, bringing your win percentage to 75%.
There was an article the other day saying it looked like someone was trying this.

Do you know of any that are opensource? I've been interested in the subject for a while.

Assume mining cost tends to be about equal to reward. Assume 25 bitcoins per block, $1000 per coin, 6 blocks per hour, ten cents per kWh, and a quarter of total cost being electricity, the rest ASIC cost. Multiply all that together and you get 2812 kWh/hr, or just under 3 megawatts power. So not bad at the moment.
But we've only got a $10 billion market cap. Suppose Bitcoin become a major currency and goes to a thousand times that? Then at the current reward we're at 3 gigawatts power. That's still only about three power plants. (That'll go down as the reward decreases, but transaction fees will have to make up some of the difference eventually or we won't have enough network security.) 
But ASICs aren't in mass production. Once they are, maybe they'll be a lot cheaper and energy will be the dominant cost again. If energy is 75% of the cost instead of 25%, then we're up to nine gigawatts, minus whatever energy is offset if we can make use of the waste heat. 
Still, it would be nice if we could use carbon-free energy for it. Renewables or nuclear could do it. Personally I'm hoping [focus fusion]( works out...an order of magnitude cheaper than fossil fuels, decentralized (5MW reactors), nonradioactive, and they only need a year and a million bucks to finish the experiment. They're hoping to crowdsource it.

Here's an [article]( on the bitcoin wiki about scalability. Looks like it can go quite a bit further up from here.
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:04:11
A really nice solution along these lines is the [finite blockchain]( (pdf). The basic idea is to have three structures: 
- an Account Tree with the balances for all unspent addresses 
- a Finite Blockchain, which is a block chain like bitcoin's, but only extending back a couple months
- a Proof Chain that has linked hashes of all the blocks, going back to the beginning of time
Since the proof chain has only a couple hashes per block, it's easy for everyone to store. The proof chain has hashes of the Account Tree for that block, along with the nonce so you can validate its difficulty. 
The proof chain keeps an attacker from spending an indefinite period of time building a fake finite-blockchain, because clients will pick the FB with the most difficult proof-chain linked to it. You can have a pretty lightweight client without having to depend on someone else to hold blockchain for you.

Sure, I'm aware of graph algorithms. But there are a lot of possible ways to go about it, and I'm curious what approach they're taking, and what kind of scalability they expect, assuming there are a lot of transactions between strangers instead of just friends-of-friends.

Back in the real world, France has just [approved]( bitcoin-backed debit cards.
If governments do try to ban it, I think they'll find it more difficult than you expect. And countries that don't choose to ban it (perhaps because they don't have a prominent banking industry) will enjoy a competitive advantage.
It's pretty easy to get tax revenue in a bitcoin world, if you tax different things. Land ownership and carbon emissions are two possibilities.

Essentially the same argument applies.
If the lender requires a 3% real return, then if we have 2% inflation he'll offer a 5% interest rate. If we have 2% deflation he'll offer a 1% interest rate. 
In either of these cases, the borrower loses the same amount of real value.
The debt deflation of the Great Depression is another matter. You've got a lot of preexisting loans for high interest rates, and a fractional-reserve banking system, which means most of the money was *created* by making loans. Then people start paying off a lot of loans, which makes the money supply shrink and deflation starts. All the remaining loans get more expensive, assuming they are at fixed rates, so more get paid off (or default), and you have the spiral.
This is quite different than the deflation that comes from a fixed money supply with an expanding economy, where deflation is expected and loans are made to fit. The only real problem would be if there's so much economic growth that the lender has to raise real interest rates or he gets no profit over keeping the money himself...but then lending slows down and consequently so does the growth, and that happens without a central bank having to interfere.

[Fix for cpu power](
For transaction limits, you can change the block size but then you get into physical limits. To scale to major-currency levels, I think we'll end up with most people using something like [this]( doing a lot of off-blockchain transactions with the bitcoin nodes just settling balances between themselves periodically.

Bitcoin is a giant public ledger saying who sent what coins to whom.
People have private keys, which they use to sign coin transfers. It's easy to verify signatures. That way only you can give away your coins.
But that doesn't prevent you from giving the same coins to multiple people. For that we have the ledger, which puts all the transfers in a particular order that everyone agrees on so you can't pay someone with coins you already spent.
Transactions are published on a p2p network. To put them in order, people take sets of transactions, add a random number, and make a cryptographic hash of the whole thing. (Feed data into a hash function and you get an unpredictable number.) If the hash is a low enough number it's a valid block and it becomes part of the blockchain. If it's too high, you change the random number and try again.
The block also includes the hash of the previous block, so that puts everything in sequence. It takes a lot of tries to get a low-enough number, so only one block is published every ten minutes or so, by some random person who got lucky. This puts everything in order.
It's expensive to do that, so when someone successfully generates a block, they get paid by a special bitcoin transaction that awards them some brand-new coins. That's mining.

Using more memory makes it more resistant to attack by ASIC. That's the main point of scrypt.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:22:01
Increasing the block size has some negative effects, like possibly making a lot fewer users able to function as full peers due to bandwidth limitations.
Long-term, when the mining reward goes down, we'll be dependent on transaction fees to pay miners. If the block size is large, we won't have transaction scarcity. Nobody will have a reason to pay more than minimal fees, since miners would just be leaving money on the table if they didn't accept small-fee transactions.
This could result in too few people mining, and insufficient security for the blockchain.
A better way might be for most people to do off-chain transactions with OpenTransactions servers, which back their accounts with bitcoins and use bitcoin transactions to periodically settle accounts with other OT servers.
This would keep transaction rates low, so a lot more people would be able to run full peers. Anyone who really wanted to do a direct bitcoin transaction could still do so, though if too many people tried the transaction fees would raise to the point that running OT clients would be more attractive.
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:37:21
People are going to expend mining effort roughly equivalent to the reward they can get from mining. This is actually a good thing, because the purpose of mining is to prevent someone from being able to apply a 51% attack and doublespend.
As mining rewards keep getting halved, we'll rely on transaction fees for mining profits. If transaction fees stay low, there's actually some concern that they won't motivate enough mining effort and the network will become vulnerable. This is the bitcoin [tragedy of the commons]( 
One solution might be to keep the block size small, so transactions are scarce and you need significant fees to get yours in. It's hard to know how best to calibrate it.

If you do the feature where you add bitcoins back to Coinbase, it might be a good idea to add the bitcoins *first*. It might make it easier to argue to the IRS that you shouldn't have to pay capital gains.
I'm not a CPA but I *think* if you have multiple purchases over time, you have a choice of which purchase to count against sale for tax purposes. But you can't count a sale against a purchase that hasn't happened yet.

This gives a way to estimate Bitcoin's market value as a currency, using the [velocity of money]( formula: MoneySupply = Transactions/Velocity.
Of course we don't know bitcoin's velocity exactly, but I think it's safe to say it's pretty low. For the U.S. dollar M2 it's 1.6, and I'd guess bitcoin is lower. If we say it's 1, then the transactions on Bitpay alone support a $100 million market cap.
Of course that's the transactions for all 2013, and the rate is increasing fast. And there are probably a lot of bitcoin transactions outside Bitpay. And the velocity might be a good bit lower than 1. And when something's growing exponentially, it's legitimate to pay more now in anticipation. Take all this together and we get a lot closer to bitcoin's current valuation.
But however you run the numbers, clearly we're well past the point where bitcoin can remotely be called a ponzi scheme or tulip bulb. Bitcoin is backed by all the things you can buy with it.

It could be but wouldn't have to be. Since bitcoin is deflationary you can earn "interest" just by keep the coins yourself. Anyone who wants to make extra return in exchange for risk could make a loan, but it wouldn't have to be a bank.
I'm thinking though that if bitcoin were to take over the economy, a lot of debt would be replaced by equity, perhaps even managed directly by the blockchain.

To clarify this a bit if the Senator isn't familiar with how it works...Bitcoin has a public ledger that puts all transactions in order. Miners are the people making that happen, and it's expensive to do. They are compensated for that effort with new bitcoins. As you say, other people's money does not pass through their hands.
FinCEN proposed regulating them as money transmitters, and that really doesn't make sense. Many of them are just people at home pitching in to help keep bitcoin running.

The whole point of [scrypt]( is that it doesn't help you that much to make an ASIC. It precomputes a lot of stuff, puts it in RAM, and uses it over and over again. You're limited more by RAM capacity and latency than you are by computation.
You can recompute that data over and over again but that's generally going to be slower than just pulling it from RAM, even with specialized hardware. So sure, you can make an ASIC for Litecoin, but it's mostly going to be memory chips and it won't be much faster.
I'm not convinced that's enough to make Litecoin worthwhile, or even that ASICs are such a bad thing, but I don't think ASICs will be a major factor for Litecoin.

I looked that up, they [said]( they did 6% of all bitcoin transactions, not of sales for real goods. A lot of the rest could have been investors.
On the other hand, if we assume the 64x growth was steady over the year, that's 8 doublings, which would mean half the transactions were in the previous six weeks. Annualize that and it's at a rate of $400 million/year currently, which puts us only an order of magnitude below the current price even assuming growth stops cold right now...which of course it won't.
If growth continues the same way, then this time next year we'll be at an annualized rate of $25.6 billion. So it doesn't take much forward thinking to justify the current price, even if we assume growth tapers to something stable over the next year or two. (Of course if growth is still robust at the end of next year we should see some pretty stunning prices.)

Check out [ppcoin]( which replaces proof-of-work with proof-of-stake (though it uses proof-of-work to bootstrap). Long-term, cpu usage should drop near zero even at massive scale. Here's the [paper]( (pdf).
Basically, hold a coin for a year and you have one coin-year. Make a transaction to give that coin to yourself and the coin-year evaporates. You burn coin-years to validate blocks, and the chain with the most coin-years is considered the "longest." The reward is .01 coin per coin-year, giving a permanent 1% annual growth rate once proof-of-work mining ends.

Null_state just explained it well. One additional point about *cryptographic* hashes: if you have just the hash, it's impossible to come up with data that will create that hash. That hash is completely unpredictable.
Impossible at present, that is, assuming an algorithm that hasn't been broken. The only thing you can do is try lots of things until one works, but the hashes are much too big to get an exact match that way.

@_date: 2013-07-07 21:40:05
Worries about scalability are what prevented me from becoming a bitcoin millionaire.
There's actually a simple solution: bitcoin checking accounts. A service provider with sufficient bandwidth holds your bitcoins, most transactions are off-chain, and the on-chain transactions are mainly just occasional balance settlements between providers.
Doing it this way, you can easily scale to major-currency levels. Some people complain about centralization but (1) anyone who wants to can be a full peer, and (2) if you don't do something like this, hardware and bandwidth issues will result in some centralization anyway.
Keeping transactions reasonably scarce could also help prevent the [bitcoin tragedy of the commons](
