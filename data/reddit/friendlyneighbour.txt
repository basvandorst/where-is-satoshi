My guess is they have no desire to speculate at all.  
They have a third party converting the coins to USD at the spot price instantly with each deposit.  
Since they hold no coins, they can not process withdrawals.

I'm experiencing problems with both the site and the mobile app.   Not refreshing balances or allowing me to send any BTC.

It was $950+ for just over a week.  $1000+ for 3days or so.

Yes you can afford to lose it, but at some point it begins to be reckless.
Let's say you have $50,000 and buy $10,000 in BTC.  20% of your wealth in one asset is aggressive, but not ridiculous.    You can afford to be aggressive, as the change in quality of between $40k and $50k is negligible.
Now let's say your BTC investment becomes $1million overnight.  You now have 95% of your money in one very volatile asset.  This is reckless.   You can take profits and drastically change your quality of life.
Of course this example is extreme, but you can see why at some point taking profits and diversifying becomes the best play.

With the current volatility of BTC, return policies will be something very easy for customers to exploit.
Assume the retailer offers a 30day return policy and I buy an item for 1BTC (for this example, assume it is $500).   I keep it unopened for the 30 days and monitor the value of BTC.
If the value of BTC decreases, I sell the item for $500 fiat and break even.
 
If the value of BTC increases (to say, $700), I get a return and take my $200 profit.
It is an easy way to gamble on BTC without taking on any of the risk.

I have been mining for a while and it has been been very profitable.  That said, I do not plan to sink another cent into mining equipment.  The technology out now is great if you could get it instantly, but wait times are around 3mos.
By the time you get it, it will be difficult to turn a profit

You add funds to your bitcointip account, it is not directly linked to your online wallet.  
That being so, you are only at risk of losing that which you have added.

BTC is not a virtual currency, my friend.   It's a digital currency and there is a big distinction.
