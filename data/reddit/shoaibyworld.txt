I hope so too. I think these news give publicity to bitcoin with news as headline in the market for people who still unknown to this technology. As it says "Bad publicity is a Good Publicity ", as far as I know trading charts and analysis, I believe we will recover within a month and start for another height. Let's see how dip we see this time. I also have a video that I follow 7 steps when it comes to trading , check out if you like and share and subscribe if it makes sense to you.

China is out for now. even Vitalik (co-founder of Eth) agrees we are in bubble due to ICO and need some regulations. I also agrees that shutting down won't help here because international market is still available and Chinese people can trade internationally and we all knows that there are several ways to do that. 
Hang in there, it is roller coaster ride.

In an interview, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgam Chase said Bitcoin is fraud and government will shutdown cryptocurrency. At the same time JPMorgan support blockchain technology. Jamie Dimon shared his personal opinion again this month in an interview with CNBC.  He warned that government will shut down if they grow too large. He further said that " crypto things are kind of a novelty." Few days ago, he mentioned in one of his interview that "Bitcoin is Fraud".
He further mentioned that these are his personal opinion. 
We have seen that JPMorgan is supporting cryptocurrency in terms of Ethereum, ZCash and other altcoins for their technology.

Both ways you can accumulate more coins. Take an example if you are planning to buy something online where you can use bitcoin as a payment and you can wait until the price can continue to go up. Just track the chart and as soon as you are sure that chart is showing maximum value of bitcoin, you can trade means sell these coins in buying any product or get some service at that price value. I hope you get it.
