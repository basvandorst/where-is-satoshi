All true but I am most interested in OpenBazaar for the fact that it is an open protocol to put a sales contract out into the internet and other websites and people can display and fulfil that contract any way they like without being put under a single corporation's rules. When people make these contracts able to be published without revealing their IP then good for them, it is their decision and risk to sell certain products.

BitTorrent also has your IP visible. So you are just proving the point.

In the travel industry it is harder to get a cc merchant to work with you and generally have to put a lot of money on deposit because chargebacks are very common in the industry. Even for airline tickets.

@_date: 2014-07-18 00:35:31
Like I mention on this thread the travel industry has a lot more chargebacks than many other industries and this is a problem for the cc merchants , so they generally charge more for businesses related to the travel industry. Even larger businesses.

You can make a payment to either a debit card or a credit card without a prior transaction have been done before. This is available on all bank and cc merchant payment APIs.

I don't think he is wanting to force stores to charge for Credit card purchases, more it is that stores have the option to charge for credit card use if they want.
@_date: 2014-07-18 01:58:12
Pretty common occurrence. From the way you think chargeback are limited it is obvious you have no experience running a business allowing cc purchases.

But you completely disregard the "textbook" answer. Why not get rid of the internet also then. The internet is the bigger part of the monetary exchange. The internet can be used for communication to organise terrorism. The internet can be used by tyrants to organise oppression. The internet is a much more versatile tool to do bad things than is bitcoin.

You don't need to have used blockchain. blockchain is just a 'Blockchain' viewer where you can see all transactions that happen on Bitcoin's blockchain. What balance does it show on Blockchain.info? There are no transactions on blockchain? What is your bitcoin address I can have a look to see.

The comment JahScientist made had nothing to do with transfer over the internet. Just that USD is very useful for criminals to use (just like Bitcoin) because of it's anonymous properties.

The original point still stands. Both Bitcoin and USD can and are used in crime. You are trying to make other arguments that have no impact on this point and are speculative in and of themselves.

No this is not disingenuous. The USD is used as a psuedonymous exchange of value and that is why it is useful in criminal activity. Just like Bitcoin.

As far as I know they own a lot of Bitcoins, which I assume will drive the price up. They are also investing in Bitcoin startups, but specifying they only want to invest in companies that bring more regulation to Bitcoin. So I could see how some Bitcoin users may have a bad view of that. I doubt they have the power to manipulate the whole Bitcoin economy.

What about a system that is not completely direct democracy but instead people decide where a portion of their taxes will go. A person wanting health care can put it towards some kind of health care initiative. Someone who like the military can put it towards military. 
This potentially could limit some government borrowing and spending on many parts of the government that people might not agree with.
