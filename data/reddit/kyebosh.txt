I guess while you still would have a password-protected private key, it's one global password instead of one per site. I see what you mean though, it moves the weakness to a single source. Good point.

Also, [mtgox.com]( is a good indicator :)

Looks like it's back up now. No word of what went wrong.

Huh. Anyone know if they're using cloudflare or another CDN? Could be possible that cached versions are still working with the API still up.

Can you try a cache [refresh]( to see if it's actually pulling from mtgox.com?

Planned downtime would redirect to a status page, or at least notify somehow. I'm guessing tech failure at best.

New or old, the fact is there's a large portion of the userbase (myself included) who are just learning about it now. Markets react accordingly, &amp; I'm sure we can imagine what the media could do with something like this. We'll see.

Thanks for the explanation! This doesn't seem too technically difficult to implement, keen to see what happens.
It does mean that the authenticating party has to make a transaction though, right? I imagine this could expose a potential DDOS style attack surface - flooding "authenticate me" requests could quickly add up. Even for legitimate uses, a site like Facebook would be spending a non-trivial amount in transactions to send these messages. Is there a way to have the client initiate the transaction instead?

It's likely that there's a new address per email, thus we know that OP didn't fall for it at least :)

Yes. Exactly this. Please!

I predict "bits" as we say "bucks", at 1,000,000 bits to a bitcoin.
