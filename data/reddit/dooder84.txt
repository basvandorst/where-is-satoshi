Yeah I'm not getting rid of my miners.   To me that would be like having someone steal from you bank account so you decided to quit your job. 
But, thank you for that analogy. I'm going to use that with her when I talk to her about it again. 
Right now she's taking a frustration nap.

Yeah, sadly it's true.  When you don't give proper training shit like this happens.

Truth be told I was training my wife as she wanted to get involved in the whole BTC market place.  I didn't explain it to her that this was a possibility.  I just gave her my phone with the 2FA access and showed here how to do it.  Then I went outside to do some work in the yard and then she came out screaming.  "He's not responding!  What do I do? What do I do?  Can we call Local Bitcoin?"  
It took me 20 min to get the whole story out of her.  
Now she wants me to sell all my miners because she things this is stupid that someone could steal from you like this.  
I told here...  "Well someone could convince you to give them cash for their stolen car.  Or con you out of money in other ways...  Why not Bitcoin"
But, now I can't pay rent.  Sigh.

Exactly.

Now that I am involved I am doing some research and the phone number looks to be from the text free app.  Not even a real cell phone number.  After I get a police report done I'll see of they can get some info from the company.
At this point though I'm thinking we're screwed.

I did complain to Local Bitcoin.  I'm going to file a police report now.

Oh, I have enough fiat to make rent.  It was just that we planned on using the cash from the sale to pay rent.   
I was just trying to teach my wife how to do btc transactions and thought this was a good way for her to see the process. She's always complaining about the garage being so hot and noisy and didn't understand the process of all that heat and noise turning into cash. 
Loosing 2200$+ is very painful to the working man.   
I do appreciate your advice though. I usually don't even look at the price of btc on a regular basis. I'm usually a hodler. Hoping to get to the moon one day.

To further clarify.  He is supposed to be local to me. He said that he was in Sacramento.  We were messaging back and forth and the "instant" that I transferred the BTC...  he was gone...
He claimed that he could do the cash transfer to my BoFA account in an instant.  The instant he had my BTC was the instant that he stopped responding.

Or near Seattle either!  
I'm watching the coins movement and I am not an expert but it looks like it is being tumbled.
