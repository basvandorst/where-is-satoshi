Bitcoin is becoming increasingly popular day by day. There are so many new people on the scene that are buying and trading bitcoin. The bitcoin network has a very serious issue that needs to be taken care of. It shouldn't take $30 to send bitcoin. I am not a fan of BCH for many reasons but I am a proponent of other alts to use instead of BTC.

It is definitely a store of value. A lot of people store their value in USD so that they can later buy something. Thats a store of value if Ive ever heard of one. It may not be the best or even very good but you can’t argue that its not a store of value.

Do the fees all add up and go to the miner who mines the block or do the fees go to each individual miner who takes your transaction?

I’m aware of the declining value of USD. I’m talking about the reason people argue for bitcoin as a store of value now that its not so good at making small payments. The whole point behind Bitcoin was to be a peer to peer payment system and now that there are better coins to do that people still stick with Bitcoin like some religion.

Wow, thats pretty awesome.

But aren’t they nearly correct? Bitcoin fees are crazy at the moment. Even before all this they were still $3-$5 which is too high.

That they are. If you don’t think being able to make transactions faster and cheaper is an advantage then you must be extremely gullible.
