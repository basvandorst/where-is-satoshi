I just bought Forza Horizon 2 DLC using Bitcoin :) They showed up as prepaid card in Microsoft billing statement... Can't wait to play it!
Note: I used Bitcoin before, but have never been tipped on Reddit

Yes, not the VPS, though

Bitcoin Core also verify transaction, if I understand correctly, right? If not, I'm seeding existing blocks to new full node

Nope, 400GB

50GB? You are running out of space soon. The blockchain on my node is close to 50GB now

I have a Raspberry Pi at home running full node. I don't use Bitcoin Core wallet as I already have a Trezor.
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:03:27
Isn't it what full nodes do? Seeding blockchain and verify transaction?

You could also migrate to my setup, better response (~100ms vs ~15ms), more space, higher bandwidth, etc...
~~But wow, look at that price, $1.5/month. I guess you get what you pay for, but it's a really good price~~. Nvm, it's for stickers...

Like I said, Dediseedbox, 400GB VPS
