Hi Nola,
Kraken is currently US based though we serve clients world wide and currently accept fiat deposits in USD, EUR, and CAD.
If you have any further enquiries feel free to open up a support ticket and have a lovely day :)

Hi Doctor-Crypto,
Our deposit addresses are Wrapped SegWit addresses. We also allow withdrawals to all address types including bech32 segwit addresses. We also setup bech32  ready to be used for deposits not long after segwit was soft forked in however we are waiting on other exchanges and wallets to allow bech32 withdrawals before enabling bech32 for deposits.
Hope that resolves any concerns you may have had about us not supporting segwit.

Hi Johnnyazari,  
We are currently working on upgrading out [kraken.com]( interface, in the mean time have you tried our advance interface [trade.kraken.com]( as this is much more preferred by clients.
Sincerely,
