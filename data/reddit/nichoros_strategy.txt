Study market cycles, recovery requires a length of time, could be months in this case, could be less. It also sometimes means revisiting previous resistance which has turned into support. News can also swing this a certain way at any time, competition is also nipping at BTC's heels slightly. Only you can decide what you believe the story will be.
@_date: 2016-08-23 20:15:36
When one does, it could be a good deal (pending price recovery). Next few weeks/months could be rough for BTC, or really great, no one really knows. Kind of depends on what the global economy is doing, too. Mainstream confidence in Bitcoin may be low until things become clear.
Could potentially use services to convert USD to BTC automatically, and then BTC to USD if that is desired, though I don't know what those fees add up to. Possibly less than bank fees however.

Is $60 a lot? I already said that I'm enjoying it as it is. Also it's probably not going to change, the video game industry stands to gain too much by using the ability to release games early and then patch them up, it raises money early and gives them a free (though angry) group of game testers. I choose not to be angry, I like watching games develop over time.
Also, everything growing finds itself in a mess from time to time, just look at BTC, the trick you have to know is that messes can be cleaned up and angry people will forget that they were angry. It's actually a good thing in the end, the emotion cycle is key for driving growth.

If people stop depositing into banks (and they wouldn't just stop depositing, but they would also withdraw as much as they don't immediately need in there) it could lead to a cascade of events where ultimately people no longer have reason to like their currency. Deflation precedes inflation. Loss of confidence leads to loss of value. Squeezing banks around the world could get ugly real quick. All is fine until there is a liquidity crisis.

It's psuedo multiplayer, people in marketing stretch the truth all of the time, doesn't mean the the developers can't expand on the multiplayer aspect of the game later on. Releasing unfinished games to be updated later is simply the world we live in now. It is also true that the size of the universe in NMS makes it unlikely for people to meet anyway, being able to see what other players have left behind is a cool concept, though.
Ignore marketing if you are a speculator, or take all of it with a grain of salt. This is why the "code is law" marketing slogan means nothing to me, while others take it very seriously. Stretching the truth in marketing brings in more money. It's a strategy to sacrifice *some* human capital (trust) for real capital (money), initial funds are powerful, human capital comes back over time (when the waves have settled). Pop in some impressive features to show good will, and you're golden in the longer term. The gamble, of course, is deciding whether that extra hard capital is going to be utilized for growth or for waste, since no one can predict how human beings (who you do not personally know) will act, it's better to just understand the product being developed and how future updates can ramp up growth in the long term. Star Citizen is just another game in it's hype cycle, and you're assuming that it will be better, before seeing the type of issues that it too will have. On one hand, NMS has some first mover advantage, but it could also burn out.
And naturally, I will take tips in as many cryptocurrencies as I can get my hands on ;P

I've been playing NMS nearly every day, I actually have fun playing and streaming it. It still maintains a good draw on twitch (lower end of the top 30 games). The game has a lot value to it already, and will have even more with upcoming updates. Good investors can strip down hype and derive value closer to reality, hype is just noise, and usually good in the long term, after the waves have settled.
So much can happen in any of these markets, good or bad, and it can blindside people, better to have a strong intuition, technical analysis, risk management, and understanding of fundamentals. Ethereum is poised to grow, it just depends on how resilient it is at this point, and it has been very resilient lately given the drama. Anyone who bought the recent dips are happy right now.
At some point, something is going to take the spoils for smart contract technology. Maybe it will be Ethereum, maybe Rootstock, maybe Counterparty, maybe Ethereum Classic. But right now, Ethereum has the power behind it. I also think that Ethereum Classic will either stagnate or burn itself out, but no one can be sure.

Religion in Government had a pretty good track record too for a very long time. But eventually we found that things go even better with freedom of religion (decentralization of religious thought, taken out of Monarchy control) and a more secular focused Government. Did Government backed and controlled money really create prosperity? I mean we did have a gold standard until the 70s. I think it was a hard working population that created the foundation for our current wealth, not the money. Government sure has become overly corrupt and overbearing to its population in the mean time, and our obsession with debt leveraging has created a wild ride of booms and busts which, *coincidentally*, rewards those running the Government loved banking system massively each time. So perhaps, separating money from Government is the next paradigm, with a decentralized form of hard money that has qualities even better than Gold this time.

In 1880 the US had a 0% income tax, an income tax did not start until around 1913, and it was low. Quite a lot of innovation happens when Government is small and taxation very limited. People don't innovate as much when they know more and more of their success will be stolen and then squandered on a huge and costly Government.

I agree that today this is how it has to be unfortunately, there is a serious reliance in pretty much all developed countries. The entire world, for the most part, went down this road of big Government together and can't go off of it until there are serious upheavals. If we had collectively stuck more with the route of decentralized power and small Government whose main purpose is to preserve the liberty of the people (which is what the US was originally founded on) over 100 years ago and maintained it, all the circumstances would be very different, people would be different, different infrastructure would be in place, etc.

A bit of an assumption to say I never quieted down my own mind to some standard in order to observe, it's a practice and not one that many people choose to do at all times of their waking life, I would think even those who claim to be fully enlightened still have a capacity for having monkey thoughts, and I bet they even indulge those thoughts here and there. I like Alan Watts' take on meditation in the sense that he says it should be a   "fun activity". Something to do in the moment because its enjoyable. and "If you meditate to improve your character or to be more efficient in life, you've got your eye on the future and you are not meditating."   
I take it to mean the activity of quieting the mind is just another fun game to play in life, among all of the other fun games, none of them being particularly important or serious.

We know for a fact that it is used as more than a trading instrument. Buying products is one thing, and I suppose you could say that still counts as it being used as a trading instrument, but then so is all money. 
Most importantly Bitcoin provides access to the greater cryptocurrency ecosystem, and within that ecosystem is quite a lot of unique services, business/productivity services, research campaigns, entertainment services, social media services, the whole collective of autonomous systems that interact with a blockchain and attract a community of users (and of course speculators). One way to gain access to all of this is through buying Bitcoin and using it to transact.

Ok I see, well regarding Bitcoin the conversation is very simple, India's potential ban will be ineffective just like any country's ban will be ineffective. If that court hearing over a property dispute has been on going for 70 years, in what universe would the same Government of India be able to control even a small number of its citizens from accessing Bitcoin's functionality? What are they going to do, make an extreme example of a few to try to scare everyone from time to time? How much resources will they spend on this neverending daily task of policing their citizens on a system like this being used all over the world with no central authority, a system that has no hope of being stopped without something like a mass global nuclear holocaust? It has such a low barrier to entry, open sourced code and wallets, peer to peer transfers, it will continue to circulate in India whether the Government likes it or not, just like it does in China after they claimed to ban it dozens of times over the past decade.

When did I say I think India is better than USA? I think both the US and India have Governments that are too large. The US has more resources which is why it functions well compared to other countries, but it also has major issues that may cause those resources to dry up quicker than anyone might expect, and then who knows which country leads the charge. I blame the US for leading the rest of the world down a path that I do not feel was true to the original vision of its founders, the opposite in fact. Things can look good on the surface for a long time, while the inside is being hollowed out.

I've been talking about the entire world, as well as discussing India with you, we all have different beliefs about what the issues are, mine is big Government in general, the way it developed in many countries specifically over the last 100 years. We both know how horrible and tragic it would be if India suddenly disassembled its Government and let their people fend for themselves, I'm not saying it should do that, perhaps if we could go back in time, but we cannot. So is your stance that things would become better if India grew its Government even larger than it is now?

Even great traders tend to get on winning streaks that make them look like they can do no wrong until before long something about the market breaks their model or they just make a lazy misinterpretation.

Most of what you are saying has already happened. The ultra rich already control the Government, have rewritten the laws, buy up lesser companies. We have experienced quite a loss of civil liberties already. 
This would not be another country bankrupting the US, it would be global, and caused by overextension on many fronts, excessive greed. How did the previously rich do during the fall of Rome for example? Not all collapses are great for the rich, the rich have quite a bit more to lose. In today’s economy the rich have far more access to cheap borrowed money than the poor and they keep leveraging it, buying assets inflating prices, while the majority live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford these assets. When you say only the rich weather the storm I disagree, simply the fittest survive, you don’t necessarily need money and assets to simply stay alive for a period of time. There would of course be deaths, by both the rich and poor (suicide increases, some of the previously rich having their wealth evaporate will also commit suicide as in other market crashes). I’m not sure if you are factoring in how modern technology would effect our resilience compared to the past. As for the Government it should become smaller and arguably much less powerful than it is now, it currently has very little trust and credibility even in good times. And no company would be able to bail them out, the debt is far too massive, that’s why I say this will be the end of a century+ long supercycle, history would have no precedent to compare it to. It’s either have the federal reserve hyperinflate the currency, or sovereign default. We can’t just look at what happened in Russia and make connections when this would in fact be on a far greater scale and global.
After the rebalance completes those who made it will experience a future of great potential. There will always be those who made particularly great decisions during the worst of times while everyone is struggling, they often become the future elites, however the wealth gap should still improve significantly compared to now, the wealth gap is awful right now, there will never be a chance to shake that up without chaos. Again, I see it as an inevitability, I’m not going to just wish it away, whatever happens happens, our society has lead us to this place and asked for it.
What do you believe about the future? That nothing will break and we go on with eternal sustainable growth?
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:48:22
With you on that, this “stability” does not come free, it’s similar to giving away our human rights and liberty in exchange for security, some day you find that you have neither. Life is full of natural chaos and we should all become attuned to that fact. I believe stability is always unsustainable, it is really just a stored volatility. There are many different possible manifestations and levels of magnitude to this, but I imagine it’s especially bad when the stability reeks of desperation and forcing so many things to conform.

Maybe there is too much law clogging everything up making it difficult to enforce and process, and not much logic behind most of the law.
Freedom is not a safe thing, it means that you must live and die by your decisions and their outcomes without always having carefully crafted complex systems and safety nets provided by your Government, especially when it often becomes more of a business for generating Government/State revenue than a service to the people. When you want more protection from the Government you are asking for less freedom.
The basics, people should be protected when their lives and property are being threaten by someone else, but I feel it should only go to the extent that a small Government can afford. The bigger the Government, the more law is expanded to take these protections to convoluted extremes. It can never all be enforced, people will get away with murder and theft, people will die because of their fellow citizens or foreign alike whether or not police shows up to write a report.
I get that we think without sufficient police and judges, that we would be doomed, but again I think under different circumstances humans would adapt, we would be more inclined to care about and protect each other on an individual basis to fill in cracks and make up for whatever would be lacking, that's decentralized power.

You realize that they also make profit each day just by operating as an exchange, right? Trading fees and anything else their services can capitalize on at low expense.
If we’re just talking about normal investor funds in the company, via Leo token offering or other means, they can do whatever they like with those funds, including buy more BTC, if their private investors want to sell their stake, they can easily be paid on request/accept the exchange rates, why would the money not be there to pay individuals who invested in the company? We should not be afraid of entities buying BTC only to someday sell it, that is everyone’s right in the free market and I can assure you the market will be able to handle it without total destabilization, there is not much incentive to just dump it all at some particular point anyway, and if selling causes a big dip, well the smart thing to do would be to get buying again.

The Extrinsic and Intrinsic are constantly meeting each other, influencing how we think and who we become over time. Even non-verbal(non-language) stimulation, there is also the unconscious mind involved. The manifestation of different words and stimulation effect all people differently, creating quite a grey area for what information means to any of us. No message from one person to another can really be directly transmitted and understood in its purest form/intention, it can only be translated in one's own mind and then interpreted. I personally take interest in Buddhist philosophy, and so to me it's highly possible that we are talking about dualistic illusion, the separation of external and internal perhaps does not exist, we are actually connected as one but cannot see it, in which case literally all information in your life, regardless of the sense that it makes to you, its positive/negative effect on your world etc, is really just your own mental masturbation as God in a limited form.

Anyone who called the bottom accurately is certainly empowered, but to be honest it was not a huge revelation that the price was overextended at that point, it was literally below the real cost of BTC production.

We need to assume that good money will be held while bad money will be spent, Gresham’s law. Money printing was the only way out then and even more money printing will be required (much more) when it’s time to reconcile with reality.

It would be astounding if any central bank would dare create a cryptocurrency that actually meets the criteria that all legitimate cryptocurrency should, such as: decentralized network, very limited rate of issuance, fixed total supply, censorship resistant, pseudo-anonymous, freedom to cross borders, etc
This is because they would not be able to hold enough supply in order to lend massive amounts of the currency (it would slip through their hands in distribution to banks and the Government and it would proliferate across the world). Without the power to create supply and lend, the central bank forfeits the lion's share of its power.
So it would be centralized, not limited in issuance, not fixed supply, not censorship resistant, not pseudo-anonymous, and not free for anyone to use to cross borders without controls. 
This would be what they have now, databases, with the word cryptocurrency slapped onto it. And if the currency is meant to represent the national currency, well, the debt and everything else attached to that currency is inherited as well.

I can't see why both would pay more, we need to see transactions as being settled in the moment with agreed upon prices (and for the time being people are compelled to compare the number of Bitcoins they will spend or recieve to their equivalent worth in one or more fiat currencies around the world). Sometimes, though it's not common, business people who accept Bitcoin are even willing to use it as their standard (for example, 0.1 BTC for the service/product always, regardless of price, or until they set a new price). If you were talking about fees, anyone who knows how to use Bitcoin to its full potential is able to transact with nearly no fees, only in rare times is the fee market bidding up the fees in a big way, that is always going to be temporary as it self corrects, segwit and batching improved it, and now lightning will provide an even more reliable channel in terms of low fees.
So, in the moment of a transaction, the price is always what is agreed upon, either the customer gets a deal, or the bossiness person gets a deal for the moment, but naturally it should be the customer because the business person gets some great benefits by default. Firstly, Bitcoin has no chargebacks, this is undeniably a plus for the receiver of payment, and also how good money should work. The customer can get a refund when the business person agrees, in good faith and good business practice, to return the money on their own, otherwise they can refuse. Secondly, Bitcoin is an amazing asset, we all should know of its useful traits, its scarcity and limited future supply, it is basically the definition of good solid  money, and you want to keep good money for the long term, even if you have to pay a premium for it today, that's the incentive to apply a discount and get customers to spend, because one way or another you want to sell your goods and services to accumulate a stack of something that may be substantially more valuable to you in the future, or at the minimum preserves your wealth in economic upheaval. Doing business to get some diversification in your life is very nice, too. Volatility? Eat it and keep doing your work, it will be fine, that's what I say.

It is already possible to buy whatever you need with crypto, you just need to be aware of a method and use it, purchasing gift cards for example, sometimes it just takes some creativity. I personally believe that the best reason for anyone to spend Crypto is when a business has identified that something such as Bitcoin is actually good money, and are thus incentivized to offer a price discount, essentially businesses that are not afraid to speculate on the future, the customer wins there, at least in that moment, future value just is what it is.
So yeah, discounts are the edge, really just a bonus though, even at fair price spending crypto gets the job done.

Right, and if for example you use an exchange which takes in USD from your bank account, or an exchange which instead requires tether, what difference is there? Tether's system has all of the opposite-to-legitimate-cryptocurrency traits I listed, except maybe you can transfer it more freely, but tether CAN censor you and freeze accounts,  they just don't have as much reason to as central banks might. And you are only as anonymous as whichever exchanges you transfer to and from already know about you. Only way they would use Ethereum is if they can program these controls into the contract, and I doubt it would really be considered.

Inflation shouldn't have anything to do with it in my opinion, also ETH's rate of inflation seems to always be up in the air until they finish future updates. Lending is allowing someone to borrow money for an interest rate, it can be done through pooling funds in a decentralized system, the demand affects the interest rate. Then there needs to be a mechanism like voting to determine what loans should be approved or denied (applicants maybe need to present a strategy and have some kind of reputation), and then the funds need to be distributed automatically and finally a contract in place holds to receiver accountable, smart contracts can be used deal with those logistics. Both Bitcoin and Ether can be used because they are both like money, and both have functionality to handle contracts like this in different ways, if Rootstock is a success then Bitcoin will have more capabilities like Ethereum.

What does movie pass have to do with Bitcoin? The fundamentals of movie pass have always been a joke.
What do stocks in general have to do with Bitcoin? Are stock shares finite in total supply or rate of issuance? No, they can be diluted very easily, you trust the owners of the business who are human beings to both manage the supply of shares and also actually make the company generate value to justify buying them.
There is no guarantee either that getting yourself more USD over time is going to be a good idea. So yeah, we must all figure out how we allocate money, and determine what is sound. 
It's not that hard to get more money when you want some, people should not rely solely on investment for their survival. But for those who are clever and possess some foresight, it's a powerful tool, that's all. Only for a fool would it be life and death, not worth getting emotional over either. It IS character building to endure hard times without sacrificing your beliefs and principles. If your beliefs are entirely wrong, life will make sure you absolute know it. 
Bitcoin has accomplished great things already, and it will not be stopped, not by sellers, not by shadowy enemies, not by the "competition", or the miners, or the services, not by Governments of all countries put together, not anyone has the power. It will keep going. That is a far better value proposition than Movie Pass.

The software to mine and perpetuate Bitcoin may be free, but hardware and electricity most definitely is not. It has value because the the supply is finite, and more awareness of it throughout the world makes more people want to own some, and the most valuable users are the ones who regularly accumulate. While the supply does increase via mining, the rate of supply increase is less than it used to be, and that rate will halve again sometime in 2020. The value can be maintained or grow so long as demand outpaces the relatively small inflation, and anyone can participate in this demand by simply owning some amount and holding onto it, transacting with it directly to others (or gifting it to people you know) etc
@_date: 2018-05-29 20:08:32
It really wouldn't be odd if certain individuals were seeking a legit deal like that, many entities can afford it, and have good reason to buy billions of $s worth of BTC supply OTC, it's the only way to start influencing the market significantly. In order to do it they will have to really seek, and the reality is at certain times the supply just won't be there. As more entities out there want to own that kind of supply, more of them are going to come up empty handed even though they have the money.

The main difference is that these commodities are far more physical, and highly physical things have a different sort of risk, makes people want custodial service to mitigate the risk, more custodial service means far more potential for the exploitation of derivative products by institutions.

Just remember that the other money used in your savings (likely fiat currency) is liable to go down in value just the same, nothing is actually guaranteed to be stable in the universe. If you save up a bunch of fiat and next year your country experiences high inflation and prices all around you are rising, it’s no different, you suddenly can’t “sell” your savings for the same expected value due to losing purchasing power.

More capital definitely gives one an advantage on the exchanges. Someone could move the markets quite a bit with $100m and the right strategy. However once the pump and dump is complete, even if the manipulator walks away completely (and chances are they would keep at it, fueling the next pump / stabilizing the price), the skyrocketing price before the dump will attract more attention and more money, slowly but surely growing the market cap and diluting the power someone with $100m has, so long as the Bitcoin ecosystem remains bullish in general. Even the biggest whales can get rekt, the factors are always changing.

I would say it was mostly a combination of big holders conspiring to dump because they knew some minor bad news was coming from China (which would have spooked the market anyway), which then caused traders to dump, which then triggered people's stop losses and cascading margin liquidations plus further pressure from shorters. Mostly comes to down to the mechanics of fear and greed, the dump was coming one way or another, but it was a bit more violent than it needed to be. People are going to get used to the new reality after some time passes and their fear will turn back to greed when they realize that the fundamental reasons for Bitcoin's rise have not changed in any significant way. I wouldn't be surprised to see more minor dumping from here still, the market still may need to digest, but long term things look fine.

I hold the belief that if the internet somehow went down for a period of time, it wouldn't be long before people around the world started bringing it back up in either a decentralized or centralized manner (either Government would get it back up or the people will). So long as anyone still has access to electricity/battery power (which also should be recoverable if infrastructure collapsed) and hardware. There are enough savvy people out there who would understand how to sidestep/reinvent or replace ISPs. The internet is highly valuable to the human race, I can't imagine a situation where we just let it go or have no hope of recovering at least something like the internet. And the Bitcoin network would absolutely be preserved, as well as all Crypto networks, in that case.

Try to think about creative ways to get people to send you Bitcoin, think of it like starting a business on the internet. Since all you need is a Bitcoin wallet address &amp; QR code, you can post that as your channel for payment/donations, just provide something useful to the world and be outcome independent. You could make youtube videos for example and edit your QR code into the video at the beginning/end, while also posting the address in the description. Same goes for starting your own website, some kind of shop where you sell something for Bitcoin, the only limit is your creativity. You can accept it out in the world too, make a lemonaid stand or something, with your payment info displayed.
If you want to get a small amount of Bitcoin very simply, lookup "Bitcoin faucets" and try to find the highest payouts.
Mining is generally too competitive, you would need a lot of money upfront to compete with serious miners. However, if you want to invest in your own abilities for the future, building a powerful mining rig that is within your means is not a bad idea, maybe not for Bitcoin, but altcoins with less competition. It's a nice thing to have going on the side, especially if you have free electricity (that your parents would be paying for I assume). Just try to do a good amount of research and pre-planning if you try to get into mining, hardware can become obsolete over time and some blockchains use different algorithms which will not be optimal for every type of mining rig (ASIC resistance for example). Apparently Zcash, which has basically just launched, has an algorithm that mainly requires powerful CPUs and at least 8gb of RAM, but needs to be run in linux, so you would need to be able to follow some guides and install something like Ubuntu Linux OS, which isn't that tough to be honest, but expect to run into some confusion and road blocks when trying to learn details about mining and the options available (solo mining vs mining in pools vs cloud mining).
Other than that you can gather some money and buy Bitcoin, but I'm sure you know that already. Also, spend some time understanding how taxes work if you want to be legally secure when profiting from Bitcoin.
Good luck!

Bitcoin's volatility has been trending down in the big picture, with the market cap trending up. One thing that must be a factor is, within the volatility, how much of it is weighted to the upside? A person who is stuck with fiat trending toward devaluation is suffering the opposite problem that the Bitcoin economy enjoys. 
Also I think it's safe to say that fiat clearly does experience volatility, everything does. So if there's a problem that causes people to want Bitcoin, it's that at the bottom line, the fiat system is dragging itself down in many areas of the world. This is not to say that fiat will cease to exist soon, I think people will cling to it for a very long time, but that won't be enough to take care of people's economic needs worldwide.

It's on us to take responsibility as well, those who own some supply, to not be phased by the news as individuals, or be afraid about how others will react. It's all to be expected. There really is not much that *can* happen which hurts the fundamentals of Bitcoin, which is antifragile. Exchanges getting hacked is the failure of a 3rd party service, regulations have no means of penetrating the rules of blockchain, they can only attempt to attach flimsy layers of makeshift rules, generally pointed at 3rd party services, on ramps and off ramps. 
The power of antifragile systems is that they will absorb chaos like this over and over again, and become stronger by it, that is what we should all try to remember at all times.

I think the important thing is that Bitcoin works, and it's going to keep working, and it really doesn't care if the most backwards countries are not using it up to some highly adopted standard, it'll be there for them to evaluate tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, and so on. And some citizens will find a way to use it no matter what, that seems great to me.

True story, I was on vacation, and had also just dropped acid on the day Bitfinex was hacked. I knew that the bbands were super tight and a big move was coming either up or down, I saw that news as I started tripping and managed to sell my 15 BTC (like 75% of my stash) at around $595, following that I did not have the presence of mind to buy back lower, I actually had the exchange send all the money to my bank account, which took a few days.
So I had to watch the price slowly float back to where it was over the next few days/weeks, and bought back only 5 BTC at a slightly lower price before it broke above, figured I could use that money for other things. Yeah, really wish I had just hodl'd

It’s not what I am doing but quite honestly who really cares if it’s ‘potentially’ dumb, it’s also potentially very smart. Either way if someone wants to take that road as some kind of challenge/statement of lifestyle and risk appetite and isn’t so damn scared of losing value like most people on the planet seem to be, then they should do it. 
Like honestly it isn’t as big of a deal to lose everything as people make it out to be, if you have some emotional mastery. You just wake up the next day and start doing something else to rebuild it. Sometimes massive loss is the motivation for future massive gain. It’s just a matter of getting past the “oooooh me depression will now be too much because I lost something” attitude. 
And before you mention kids wife and family, I believe someone who is horrified of failing to provide and stressed out about it is much more difficult to truly love and respect than a person who might make big mistakes but owns up to it, learns, and gets right back on the horse free of fear.

I'm happy to use a very loose definition for what investing is, but smart investing is putting money into something that has good odds of performing for you. If you want to invest in putting money into a slot machine, then go ahead, but you have guaranteed very bad odds, especially the more you invest. And it does not matter how many people put money into scratch offs or slot machines, the odds never get better for you. I can tell you that if the guy you know keeps buying scratch offs after making $10,000 he is GOING to lose all of it, based on real statistics.
Bitcoin did not go up over time because of randomness, it went up for a whole list of reasons, for the fact that it has real world use, for the fact that early investors knew that more investment was coming, and that even more is coming from the institutions, the mainstream, and from the laggards. It's a technology that is going to connect our world even more, this time not just via communication, but with money itself. Money taken out of the hands of the state and the banks, one of the biggest issues the world is tackling with today (Government Corruption due to monetary policy and collusion with banks)

So only spend at a merchant that you can confirm holds the coin if you want. I wouldn't say it's anymore expensive on your end though either way. Even if they do convert to fiat, at least the business sees increased sales, which helps legitimize crypto that much more, increasing the chance that they will continue accepting it and perhaps not convert to fiat in the future.

"The moment you buy Bitcoin, you've already left China."
Love that, people need to understand this. There is no regulation that can put capital controls on Bitcoin, best they could do is drive it into a black market after destroying very profitable businesses, and once people have their Bitcoin, they can send it absolutely anywhere. And if they try to really go after people who they detect are buying Bitcoin, well good luck collecting all of that information and then enforcing it person-by-person, people will just become more secretive and less trusting of their government, who are blatantly attempting to destroy their livelihood.
If they seriously attempt to ban Bitcoin, well let's just say there would be quite a bit of opportunity in arbitrage if you were to come in contact with some Bitcoin hungry Chinese citizens over the internet ;)

@_date: 2018-06-26 23:58:34
The risk is only in having your BTC on the exchange while it is lent out to traders. The risk in any loan as the lender is the contract itself and how they receive the funds you're lending, but it works really well when it's all done on the same platform autonomously, like on an exchange, I'd call that less risky than straight up sending someone BTC. A business loan in BTC should yield more, I see more risk in it.

If average people don't need to pay tax on their exchanges using a strengthening dollar, or get tax deductions when the dollar is inflating on them, then they should probably keep the same standard with Bitcoin, consider it money and save everyone time (and money). It says right there:
“These virtual currencies essentially allow taxpayers to pay for the goods and services they need in the same way as traditional currencies.”

Nothing was ever stopping them from using it, but they can't "have it", only a share of the wealth it generates. People are able to use Bitcoin completely undetected when taking the right steps, it's pseudonymous as of now. I'm not saying people can't be tracked when some detective work is done AND the person made themselves visible through something like linking their address to a KYC/AML exchange or other kind of 3rd party service, or using a less than ideal application and/or device to transact. The detective work is not free, it would be a lot closer to free if the system being used was a Chinese Database (ex. Alipay), Bitcoin is not nearly as convenient for tracking. Regardless, the fact that the system is transparent is more important than the fact that transactions are trackable, logically we can't have it both ways when the goal is to have a decentralized trustless system of transactions. Here powerful elites are on the same playing field as anyone else, their financial activity is shown on the blockchain and only through cleverness can it be difficult or impossible to track. I much prefer that over central control of the system and favoritism, Bitcoin is much more in line with capitalism and free markets due to its transparency.

What is so flawed about it? I explained how people in the 3rd world can and do use it, are you looking for statistics or something?
How about this volatility: ever since 2008, there has been a relentless ongoing every day debate and degradation of people's faith in USD, me included, I CANNOT feel safe with it no matter how it performs, no matter what its global reserve currency status is, I fundamentally cannot agree with the actions taken to "stabilize" due to how I view it affecting us in the future, apparent market stability can simply mean stored potential of massive volatility, and of course what financial volatility there is in the dollar, it's all been to the downside in the long term. If the US Dollar is backed by faith now, and that faith is completely shaken by droves of people who keep seeing it this way year after year no matter what, how is that not volatility? Is mental volatility not on the same level as economic volatility? I would argue mental volatility is worse, and Bitcoin is something that I CAN trust, no matter how it performs!
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:44:17
Keep in mind that this doesn't always have to be the case, and at times in the past it sort of wasn't. The BTC and Altcoin markets used to be inversely correlated, meaning BTC would go up in USD value, and traders would then sell their Alts for BTC and even the USD value of those Alts would get traded down. Then when BTC hit some resistance and started moving down, traders would buy into Alts again for safety.
Not sure if we will ever see this again, but I think it is possible that someday the new collective generation of traders may snap into this sort of behavior again. It's a much bigger ecosystem now, though.

There's a lot going on, and I think the prime reason why cryptocurrency is unstoppable, is because it would require all of the incredibly powerful centralized forces out there to work together to even have a chance, and that won't happen. And so, whichever forces make the move to direct tons of resources towards stopping all of this, is risking the complete waste of doing so, while their enemies go ahead and embrace new technology which now leaves them a few steps behind.

Technology raises the standard of living for the masses, not money configurations, inflationary or deflationary is just a dynamic, both can work, both have worked, both have advantages and disadvantages but that depends on all the other factors. Gold is slow to transact, especially across distances, that's a flaw cryptocurrency does not have, Gold's rate of supply increase is also random instead of predictable and scaled relative to total work (PoW). Gold made up for its flaws because no one in the world had a monopoly over its issuance and it was also aesthetically pleasing, this allowed for global trade. It was natural for civilization to progress this way.

Some people like volatility, I actually believe everything is more volatile than anyone understands, hidden volatilities, tenuous connections between systems, that's part of nature. But also, I think chaos is far more stable and good for order than any understands, we live within many paradoxes.
I can't imagine not owning BTC, it would have to be pushed to worthless and then kept there for that to change for me. I also just used BTC just the other day to buy something on a website that didn't take debit (only check or something?), very convenient for me.
Realize that people all around the world have different understandings of what is good to trade with, what has given them a financial boon, what they grew up with, every day the old get older and disappear, with the young just beginning, they're the ones who choose.

It is though, the thing is that there's not just one method of storing and transacting from the users perspective (as in there are many 3rd party wallets and tools out there to utilize, some better than others, some more secure and trustworthy than others, also the 2nd layer options emerging like Lightning), Bitcoin is programmable money. So the perceived "difficulty", I think, is really just uncertainty about what to use and what is trustworthy.   
In time the masses will settle on the "best" and most common, user friendliest tools, they will become aware of all the features, and then transacting is extremely easy. It fundamentally has always been easy the moment you settle on a good wallet, it's not like there's anything actually complex about sending a transaction, people just tend to be afraid of the unknown and assume it will be more difficult than it is.

The design of Bitcoin has manifested through open source developers from all around the world. China did not create it, and it does not have features that they would want implemented, they cannot control it or change it, it is expensive to analyze and then use that analysis to prosecute people, the protocol does not fully identify people (which is what China would prefer), and further privacy features are still possible to implement.
As far as trackable digital currency goes, what do you think the current fiat system is? It's a massive financial spy net for anyone not using cash. The US censors people by freezing accounts; banks, paypal, whatever. This is not possible when using Bitcoin wallets without a lot of expensive coordination.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:21:31
It comes down to there being multiple methods of moving BTC, some are for people who want the highest security, some are for people who want quick and easy access for spending. The same private keys can be used in more than one way, you can also have more than one wallet with different amounts in each, one for cold storage protection and one for easy spending (phone wallets like Airbitz, Breadwallet, etc)

Imagine a device that has a secure element like a ledger hardware wallet, which doubles as a tiny printing press (you would need to keep specific paper loaded in. You could store a large amount of coin on it with the same level of security, but also there would be a function that prints up a note  and simultaneously moves the allocated amount into its own newly created private seed (you would pay a small network fee as well of course, and then have the receiver of the note reimburse the amount if desired)
There would need to also be a way to conceal the generated key, perhaps a highly authentic scratch off seal that can’t be seen through on either side of the paper. Also there could be a QR code that when scanned pulls up a block explorer that will confirm there are still unspent coins associated with this key.
It’d be like being your own central bank now with printing press included, but without the monetary inflation!

Well you are talking about adoption and acceptance. I am just saying that the functionality to make a transaction is fundamentally simple. No cryptocurrency has mass adoption. It is wrong to say that Bitcoin is not accepted “anywhere”, it is actually accepted in many places, and far more than just a few years ago. Bitcoin has a greater chance to be widely accepted than other cryptocurrency, as of now it has a much greater network effect, people know what it is before the others. Businesses that accept crypto are almost always including Bitcoin as an option, not excluding it. What is so difficult about the learning curve? As for costs I think it is very cheap to transact considering what is being accomplished, and again utilizing lightning gets those fees even lower which is incredible.

It doesn’t necessarily need to be calculated in USD, but it’s always an option. As long as both parties agree, the employer could pay a static x BTC regardless of the value, or simply make the calculation at the agreed time of pay and send the variable amount of BTC. Either option can be automated.

Enough with trying to define investing, if you have dispersed your energy, money, resources, power, focus, time, whatever, you are investing in it. Seriously, there seems to be a war about what the word investing means and can be applied to, why do you think that is? If you are watering a fucking plant you are investing in it. There is no way to be certain what is or is not temporary in terms of holding value. On a long enough timescale, literally everything you know will fall apart.
@_date: 2019-02-12 21:00:47
That depends on how expensive it is to also put together extra staff, order enough supplies, and everything else that goes along with scaling up that much. You would probably need to rely on some big investors who then want to pull the strings and get a big cut of the profits.
It also depends on whether or not the demand is going to really be there consistently, or just on rare occasions. Also in the U.S, employers who employ 50 or more people are then required to provide health insurance or pay a tax penalty, now trying to seat 1000 people isn't looking as great. You probably would have been much better off buying/renting property that wasn't so large, then there would be even more cash in hand. An operation that is more reasonable for normal people to sustain with autonomy.

...There can be a supply shock that only lasts a short amount of time until people react and move more coins to sell. It doesn't mean loss of confidence in the exchange (though it certainly can mean that). Coins can be added to exchanges and be removed, if too many are removed it can result in this type of shortage.

I only said run out because it is possible, an exchange can have no more BTC left, it's just a possibility. I implied that if that does happen it is likely temporary until the shock is resolved, by getting new BTC liquidity onto the exchange. How any given exchange would handle this event depends on the exchange, some may try to hide it, some maybe freeze their market, some may be honest.

Of course it does, of course things can go "bad". Who cares, if you're making bets then bet both  against people's overblown fear and for what has been historically accurate. Risk management is a given, everyone has their own sense of it and learns their own lessons. People are so scared of losing money, but when they make money it's like "oh neat, I hope I can do it again", why is losing money such a travesty while gaining money is just alright? Because humans are so emotional and irrational, they are skewed  to negativity. Losing is a part of life, and not giving one shit about losing but rather simply persisting ahead is the key to gaining far more than you would have otherwise. And by the way, I have never traded USDT spreads, I also do not have a Bitfinex account. I just know about and observe what is possible, what makes sense to me, and what has been happening for the past 3-4 years or so.
The majority of what is perceived and worried about by the masses is often nonsense. Things could have gone very bad if China banning Bitcoin could have meant anything the past 20+ times, but it never does really matter. The thing cannot be enforced and people+the market are prone to amnesia. The truth is that Tether can flip flop around forever about their fiat backing and this and that, act shady but then instill confidence again, get attacked by the US, whatever you want.
The question I care about is, how are you going to make those who utilize USDT regularly lose all faith, for real, forever? Not people who perpetually call it a scam and get others on board (the effort affects very little in reality), but the people who adamantly use it despite anything, and the people who get scared but then come right back to it. I bet there are many many people right now calling it a scam while simultaneously using it! Who is going to stop traders and stakeholders of Tether/Bitfinex from stabilizing the price around $1 despite ANY bad news when it has always served them well to ignore bad news. Can someone stop Tether from functioning other than its own technical operators? Its functions do not require USD backing, people just want to know it is backed because they want to feel safer. This thing can actually function on pure faith, JUST LIKE U.S DOLLARS THEMSELVES. The profit being made off of the tether system and Bitfinex Exchange most likely DOES generate more than enough USD to make people who need to claim it happy, and it could very well be backed, is $3 billion really such an astronomical amount of money in today's age? Right now there is ONE MAN who is worth over $150 billion (Bezos), not the company he runs, the man himself.
We don't know the details of Bitfinex and Tether, we never will, whatever we hear or see is just words and documents from all sides. If the US AG can find a way to make tether transfers stop because they disabled its system, permanently, without possibility of just moving the system elsewhere and popping right back up, thus continuing to exist, then maybe in that case Tether is in trouble, but I am very doubtful that it can happen.

This was the chart for BFX/BTC (not BFX/USD)   [
So they were issued at a BTC value \~60% less than the goal, within 5 weeks customers could sell them for close to the full BTC valuation, and had a few weeks of opportunity to do so as can be seen. And then again in mid March 2017 could be exchanged for full BTC valuation for a window of time.
I'm not saying that it's some great thing that happened, but it's a lot better than nothing. Most importantly, the issue is people are claiming they know the details so clearly, like they know the BTC loss was an inside job instead of a hack, etc. No one on here knows, and many have an agenda to spread dissent and confusion by coming up with various theories.

The full story is, they gave everyone a haircut and replaced the money with BFX tokens with the promise that those tokens would increase in price until it covered the full value removed by the haircut (probably meaning that the future profits generated by the company would be used to bid up the value to 100% coverage), this was accomplished, so the only people who lost money were those who sold their BFX tokens before they rose to 100% valuation, which did not even take very long if I remember correctly. And also those who invested in the tokens while they were low profited.

You don't need to store the wallet on "some platform", if you create your own wallet and understand how to access it then you can cut the 3rd party out.

And I know as well as you do that purchasing power is what actually matters here, not the saying 1x = 1x.
Bitcoin shredded people's purchasing power IF they converted something stable into it at an awful time, my case is there have not been many awful times to buy Bitcoin in history, if you were buying 1.5-2 years ago you have substantially GAINED purchasing power. If you were buying a tad later you are more like break even, only in a certain recent window of time is something like 1/2 - 1/5 your previous purchasing power (as of now) your fate.
However, there is really never a good time to be storing value in fiat currency, it is losing value perpetually, and we can expect that.

I would say it's ponzi-ish, BUT, it's creating tons of content and the platform is very interesting, can't deny that. So, there may be some real value in the ecosystem, even if it's just in terms of human eyes and interaction, especially if you use it and make good posts. I have a small investment in it, all in steem power, it may go to 0, but if the market holds these levels long term, which is going to depend on consistent demand to meet whale selling pressure, then my account is passively generating a few STEEM per day, which translates to a dollar or two per day (locked up in steem power), and I would like to use the platform actively for business advertisement. They also support bots which I like and will dabble in to generate some more from voting. Pretty robust system despite the clear ponzi signs.

Fair enough


When it comes to being self employed, I think the reason most people do not become rich is because they lack the persistence and self esteem, not necessarily the strategy. People tend to quit things right before they were going to achieve new levels of success for some odd reason. People will exchange their potential for comfort when it becomes too much for them. Also, a lot of people in the situation are desperate to be rich, which makes it so they will not become rich. I'm determined to persist *until* (as Jim Rohn would say). I've become very accustomed to resistance over the past year or two, I understand how it works, beat your head against it for long enough and keep refining, eventually you get the breakthrough. I'm cool with having absolutely nothing on the regular if I need to, as long as I'm finding ways generate what I need to survive day by day, with the end goal being to create surpluses in more efficient and enjoyable ways.

Just buy small amounts periodically with money you are not afraid to lose each time, if the price is going up then great (but your fiat will buy you less BTC), if the price is going down then oh well (but your fiat will now buy you more BTC). This can be a good way to just forget about the price, and still accumulate a good sum of BTC over time, as you say you want, with discipline. Don't forget to setup a proper wallet and take your coin off the exchange.
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:31:30
Just my thoughts in general: If you pay someone BTC then they are allowed to do anything they like with it, that's how the community should view it, that is economic freedom.
Yes if you are paying your taxes with crypto then they are likely to be sold by the state for USD, but it should generally make no difference because 1.) If you already had the USD, you should pay with that instead, it's less valuable in the long term. 2.) If you do not have the USD already and rely on crypto, you would have needed to sell your crypto to USD anyway, so they would just be saving you some effort.
It's important to remember that the mechanism of taxation for a country is the primary means of backing its currency. Therefore I say if another form of currency is accepted by the state, they are (in either a small way or a big way)  also backing that other currency. They may sell it for the native fiat currency on your behalf, but just the fact that they accept it is important, because in time it could very well become clear that it is in the best interest of the state to retain some of the crypto holdings for them self, as a hedge of sorts.

This is an economy that has far, far less maintenance than the entities that normally house an economy: sovereign countries. Bitcoin doesn't need any military, there's nothing physical to defend, doesn't need to build a sort of infrastructure that allows people to live every day, etc. The mechanisms that allow this to work are autonomously executed, no need for any human bureaucratic structure to keep it alive, a Governance model is built in for allowing changes through. Bitcoin only "needs" miners, users, and services in its infrastructure, and the amount of those things can scale down to almost nothing, yet the base protocol would STILL work.
The notion that economies absolutely need inflation cannot be correct, only economies that are in a position to benefit from inflation (for competitive growth reasons with other physical countries who are playing the same game). And of course, what may seem to work well during a period of time can potentially have quite a lot of hidden cost in the unforeseen future, it depends on whether or not you were borrowing from it, and whether or not what you borrowed was turned into real growth or squandered.
Plus, for now, Bitcoin does have inflation, it only reduces over time, it's not going to be 0% inflation for a very, very long time. I suppose it can reach 0 or less (deflation) depending on how much coin is being permanently lost vs block reward mint each day.

I would say the most important thing is a good quality gym membership, I pay $40/month for mine, it's the first place you can drive over to after waking up each day. Encourages working out each day and then showering + all hygiene, also provides some storage. 
For sleeping, I currently own a car, no payments, I can build a comfortable bed type setup in the backseat, cover every window with some kind of material from the inside to block light &amp; other people's vision, then remove it in the morning. Can park in a walmart lot, which is allowed overnight. Trunk is extra storage.
I also co-own a mobile carpet/upholstery cleaning LLC which has a work van. I was thinking that I could potentially take about $3000 and purchase a second work van (tax write off), and then modify it to build a nice room to live in. Then, if the business expands enough to require 2 work vans, we would already have it, and I could just deconstruct it and move on so that it can be used for business.
For food, I eat paleo/keto, so my appetite is consistently low. One idea I have is to eat only 1 meal per day, and for that meal I will go to a specific buffet restaurant, and at this place I would *only* eat the healthiest food which fits my diet. As it is all you can eat, I can pack on calories after working out, nice way to build muscle, easy protein + fat + vegetables. Would cost only about $8 per day for the lunch special, so around $240 per month, that's something I can afford since I will have barely any other expenses. I may also be able to acquire free food in clever ways to cover meals or keep around. Water is free.
And then for the rest of the day, I can go to the Library, or a McDonalds, or a Barnes and Noble, anywhere with free wifi and place to work with my laptop, all day. I can also hang/work with friends at their apartments, and go about any type of business I have that day.
The one thing that could be tricky is where to set up my main PC. I believe though that I have a trusted friend who would allow me to move all of my tech equipment (large lcd television, gaming consoles, gaming PC, webcam, studio mic, 2x monitors, and everything else related to those things), in exchange they can use that stuff whenever they want. I could go over and use the equipment when I want to create a video or broadcast a stream while they are at work(I would like to dabble in game streaming and building up a youtube channel). Anything else I own is not really needed, I could save my furniture in private storage if I decide to, or find someone who has the space, but I don't particularly care about that stuff.

Could just load up a wallet and link it to a smart contract that will automatically send the allowance from your wallet to theirs on a schedule. Can XCP or Rootstock do this yet?

People spend something when they feel they can afford to, simple as that, doesn't matter what the thing being spent is or what its future may be, it can be good to take a step back and not worry so much about squeezing every drop of value out of a system for personal gain, the cognitive dissonance that it can create is probably more costly than the money in the end.

I can't really understand how a stable metric for value could ever be created. Always too many moving parts and relationships, you have the nostalgic past and the unknown future ever obfuscating perception of a system trying to operate in the present. Not to mention, everyone knows that systems run by ever corrupted human beings (who are competing with each other around the world) are certainly only going to be "stable" until suddenly they really are not and therefore never were. Imagine all of the hidden variables that must exist but have to remain hidden at all costs to maintain a status quo.
Nothing is stable. Everything and everyone of us is plunging down the endless void while desperately looking for big rocks to cling onto, but they are falling all the same, and they will finally make impact and break down just like you will, so that new systems can form and continue the descent. It's a great thing actually, embrace it.

Even when the block rewards are near zero, who is to say they are not still worth a substantial amount in relative value? (plus the fees of course)

Transaction fees are a market, it's only going to be a $20 fee if people are willing to pay that much for block priority. Lightning is supposed to take a lot of transaction demand off of the main chain, probably already has, so fees are only going to raise if Bitcoin is seeing massive record amounts of transaction demand and for whatever reason a lot of it is bidding up fees to get into blocks quicker on the main chain. If you were going to buy coffee, the idea is to use lightning network and pay less than a cent in fees.

Primarily trading yes, I have been trading/analyzing cryptocurrency just about every day through early 2015 up until now, was a buyer of Bitcoin as low as $215, and Ethereum since 0.003 BTC (been a wild ride). Trading is a dangerous thing, but I have been generally successful and have improved my risk management, it's my most developed skill/hobby. I am also determined to use my programming knowledge to get involved in a crypto related project, but have been unfortunately distracted. 
Besides crypto I also am the co-owner of a mobile carpet cleaning business with my good friend, so I want to also allocate time developing that, currently it can bring in a few extra hundred $ for me each month. Another thing I would like to develop is a gaming channel on twitch + youtube, just as a hobby and to see how good I can get at adveritsement and entertainment, I already have solid equipment to do this (gaming PC, professional webcam, studio microphone, 2x Monitors (1 brand new for ideal quality and resolution).

Well at least with this logic we can now say that all of the fiat systems are inflationary by factors of infinity, because we can just extrapolate into the future that central banks+lesser banks will create new currency endlessly and there is no ceiling.
However, if we look at things as they are day by day, it’s more clear that Bitcoin has been inflationary, but less so every 4 years, and at times this can flip to deflation, because I am not sure if you are accounting for coins that have been burned or permanently lost. In time after enough reward halvings, there will definitely be deflation in the amount of lost and unrecoverable supply.
And the price does react positively to reward halvings before they happen, just look at the chart.

But it is definitely not solely the electricity cost securing the network, because if theoretically electricity became infinite and free to everyone, the network would still be secure, both miners and potential attackers need powerful hardware, that’s the real cost to scale an attack, electricity is just another cost on top. Lower the electricity cost and it incentivizes miners to scale up their operation with more hardware (which would actually increase the cost of attacking the network)

The supply of alts have no relation to the supply of Bitcoin, but everything can be traded. Bitcoin has the most secure network because of its hashrate and time spent operating, it also has very strong momentum due to first mover advantage. The market caps of alts can either move into Bitcoin's or absorb some of Bitcoin's market cap depending on how competitive and attractive they really are overall on a daily basis.

Fiat is eternally linked to its Government and productivity of the people and land under that Government's rule (as well as any DEBTS involved, income and expenses from international trade, etc), so this Government with its central bank needs to maintain perfect stability in accordance with all those participating in the system both internally and internationally, or else the currency will fluctuate via the price of everything else in relation (inflation/deflation and so many other market forces). How does stability ever hold up if people can simply choose to stop using the currency for good because they do not support the country that it is linked to any longer? What if tax laws begin to stop being enforced due to sheer lack of resources to track and penalize citizens, what else really compels human beings to use this currency for the rest of time? Especially if more attractive options are rising to the surface. Just the price of everything else in the world alone would ruin anything close to perfect stability. If anything black markets would simply undermine the whole thing if there is some illusion forcibly being held up by Government manipulation.

More like deflation, rather than hyperinflation. There would be less Bitcoin to go around, so prices of other assets drop due to demand in the currency.

That's why you simply take some inflationary currency that will lose value over time and buy back the BTC you spent. Now you've rid yourself of something that will lose value to replenish your holding in something that will gain value, while at the same time helping to put BTC in someone else's hand, which, helps the value proposition that much more, because the more potential hands in BTC the better.

This post explains generally how I understand it, take it as you will. The system is inflationary and is made up of three different currencies, unlike Bitcoin. It encourages users to lock their steem up in steem power, which takes 2 years to fully cash out on but gains the most interest over time and also gives you more voting weight. Users are getting paid by the system creating more currency. New investors and/or more money coming into the system is important, just like a ponzi (and also like a business, isn't everything in life pretty much just some type of pyramid scheme?), to keep the market cap up and hopefully growing, and it may be feasible if the platform continues to attract this much traffic and advertising opportunities. Right now all profit generated from social media goes to companies like facebook or reddit, this is an attempt to capitalize on the social media honey pot in a decentralized way so that not only a corporation reaps the profits. Could still balloon up and fail in someway, it's an experiment and no one should invest what they're not willing to lose.
One important fact is that people can start an account for free, and start adding content to the site without any investment at all, just like reddit. A whale could even upvote that new users post and make them some real money if it gains some momentum, investment is entirely optional. They might even still start new users off with a small amount of steem power. Though they have restricted new account creation here and there in the past. The idea here is network effect has a value to it. So if the devs have found a sweet spot in balance, I think it could go on and thrive for a very long time.

In this system the miners absolutely must consider what the users want, if there is a serious negative reaction to a protocol change the miners will both receive less blocks, less transaction fees, and also a lower BTC price, because many users WILL stop using the system if a malicious change goes through, and changes cannot be hidden. Not only that but a very large majority of miners must coordinate to make the change, all over the world. This is game theory at work. Only what is good for the system should succeed in this design, based in real logic, which is why there were debates for years over changes happening only recently. 
With fiat currency, the issuers of currency and masters of monetary policy do not need to be beholden to the users in nearly such a dire way, they can push through decisions without that massive global web of consent, put on a show to make the plebs complacent and confused, while nothing is stopping them from altering the system in malicious ways that only benefit certain people/institutions. The general user is also forced to pay taxes in that currency, on top of what they already pay due to central banks need for inflation. In a better system, the right decision in monetary policy when things get dicey, is nothing, and that's what Bitcoin is almost always doing, because consensus is so strict. Nature corrects if the system is resilient, patient, and the proper pain is felt. Only in the most dire situations where the majority absolutely must or should come together and act, will something change in Bitcoin. Central banks have no such dynamic for restraint.

The mining pool doesn't only earn fees, it also earns the block reward of each block mined.

Sometimes joining the pack works, sometimes joining the pack doesn't work. Perhaps miners do not value the fiat currency that they are spending because they believe that is the system which will not continue to work compared to the BTC they earn. No one earns value without some combination of putting in energy and taking on risk. It can be just as risky to assume that a system which has been profitable for over 9 years will not continue to be profitable, as it is to assume the *long term* trend is going to reverse and everyone currently putting in their energy is going to be a sucker.

There are fine reasons to use that strategy. 1.) Paying with Bitcoin puts it in someone else's hands, even if they sell it for fiat, that next buyer now has it, and eventually it may go off the exchange and into a new wallet, more people holding Bitcoin grows the system, it decentralizes the decision to dump (say you have 1 BTC, and spend .2 BTC on something, then later on you get spooked and want to dump, you may dump .8 BTC while the person who has your .2 is still holding, now consider this on a mass scale), so indirectly, spending some BTC can help grow the value of the rest of your BTC in the long term. If you are concerned with liability of spending, then you must be dealing with a terrible business who not only has a broken Bitcoin payment system (it's really not that hard to get right and should be an automatic process), but also has no care for its reputation, which is a huge mistake in business. Basically, just don't send BTC to a scammer.
2.) Buying back what you spent by drumming up some fiat is a great idea because ridding fiat for BTC is historically, almost, always an excellent idea, and the more excuses to do it the better. Fiat is common, Bitcoin is rare.

What do you mean? These markets have been around for nearly a decade now, the notion of buying/selling slowly is a function of the investor, not the market, it's a matter of personal discipline. It means evaluating the trend say once per month and adding a small portion of your expendable money, or taking profit on a small portion of your investment. It's both the frequency and amount of money allocated that determine how fast or slow the person is investing. Totally up to the investor at how they execute this long game strategy.

Just because these people don't have access to the upper echelon of productive value does not mean it is not a viable strategy to help pay the bills and have some left over, perhaps even position them for some level of longer term return on investment.

Maybe I don't know what it's like for most people, I've been making my entire living by trading crypto for 1.5 years now, don't receive paychecks or any kind of steady income. Most of my focus goes into identifying when it is a good time to be buying and holding a crypto portfolio and when it is dangerous to be holding and time to be taking profit in preparation for the next cycle, this is what I mean personally by "squeezing every drop of value" out of it, but I think many others have a similar mindset even if they do get steady fiat income. So basically, it's a relief for me to spend BTC every once in a while just for the hell of it, it can actually be very convenient, and the fact remains that circulation of cryptocurrency peer to peer does actually happen, it is likely increasing actually, without fiat involved at all other than a metric for pricing, and it does indirectly strengthen the entire ecosystem over time by getting the coins in more potential hands, which is a good thing for my longer term investments.
The only fiat I hold onto is a solid emergency fund that I keep bolstered regularly. If I make a trade that nets .1 BTC for example it's more convenient than getting a fiat wire to my bank, to spend it on something regardless of future projections. Of course I will also try to time ideal periods where spending crypto is actually profitable, but the success of that decision never really concerns me.

I agree with you, this should not be about disrupting the rich who earned their money by whatever means they could and are more likely than anyone to use their capital to grow an economy (the most fair, accessible economy available to them as job creators!), but rather fundamentally separating money from the state, from Government, which makes our economy much less than fair on the playing field, which can be easily bribed with cheap money, which bails out and subsidizes particular businesses that made far too many mistakes and deserved to fail in accordance to nature. And by proxy of course, removing the ability for an entity like the Federal Reserve from creating money, and keeping interest rates low at its own, human controlled, will. The free market is what we need, and we don't have it now while the most accepted forms of currency are regulated by Governments, and those working too closely with Governments, who squander tax revenue, cause inflation, fetishize debt, and pick and choose who is favored. Governments need to become much smaller in their power, to levels not seen in a very long time.
Income inequality should ebb and flow within a certain threshold in accordance to the natural power distribution, there will always be wealth concentrated at the top if a system is to function well. and I really think that, given what we have now, should we the people, or natural forces, put real widespread economic power into a new, decentralized, borderless, algorithmically controlled currency immune to human intervention no matter how powerful, it will actually result in some rebalancing of wealth distribution in favor of the common people, and lead to a far more robust economy for the world as a whole. Unfortunately however, this may partly happen simply because under the circumstances we face, this kind of transition will potentially demand major population decrease, which is one way of freeing up opportunity to the survivors.

You believe alts "erode" Bitcoin's return potential. I say they act as a sponge that BTC has a positive connection to.
What index fund includes every stock including all penny stocks? I can't imagine that performs well. How about all foreign stocks as well?
Also no where did I say to only invest in Bitcoin, I was a very early investor in Ethereum (post initial offering), here's what I've personally settled on,for now, as long term holds that I was relatively early on: BTC, BCH(and all forks/airdrops that my cold storage collects), ETH, LTC, XLM, STEEM, and my precious FUCKs (my only ICO coins other than DAO, which returned flat)
Nothing crazy, I keep it simple and re balance regularly. I also don't just use one strategy, with some of my funds I day trade actively on GDAX, I'm currently self employed and this is how I spend my time, creating TA and making reasonable short term bets. With my other USD savings, I cost average long term investments as well. Again, keeping it simple.

Just like everything in life, double edge swords, yin and yang. What is really better? Money that people want to stuff in their mattress because it is stable or goes up in value, or money that makes people create asset bubbles, because it's essentially being given away at low interest rates and supply is increasing too quickly. Seems like methodic disciplined balance is the key. The fiat economy is out of balance and may not be able to recover. It's another cycle, birth and death.

Index funds are also not the market itself, they are a basket of stocks. 
While Bitcoin is not a basket of cryptocurrencies, there are much different dynamics at play, which is why we should not treat this so much like the stock market. Bitcoin is in the position where all lesser currencies are traded against it. Bitcoin also has the greatest strength in terms of security, which happens to facilitate the most important qualities in currency, fungibility/durability, Bitcoin stands the test of time greater than any other cryptocurrency (while also maintaining the highest market caps, the honey pot of any hacker who thinks they can break its security), which also adds to its stability (another quality of currency).
All of the other cryptocurrencies are great, but they ARE lesser. There is more talent attracted to Bitcoin, Bitcoin has more net awareness, I can just keep going on and on. The web of alts help strengthen Bitcoin, and Bitcoin helps raise all ships, it's a good mutual relationship, but make no mistake that Bitcoin is dominant and we have no reason to change that belief. Fighting against these principles is like fighting against the FED in the stock market. But again I stress, this IS NOT the stock market.

Neither the quantity of Bitcoin in your wallet nor Dollars in your bank account increase or decrease if you leave them alone (aside from extremely minuscule interest  payments from bank accounts) .

The problem is with a long term dynamic at play that drives up prices. 
Insurance companies pull in vast amounts of money so regularly, money that often never needed to be spent at all, they establish themselves as a middle man attempting to provide convenience when money is needed in an emergency, and to compensate damage when it occurs. Problem is, they become so rich in the process that all the services they pay for begin to use them as a money battery, continuously able to raise prices. They both grow and grow together, insurance companies start to raise premiums, meanwhile investors love the reliability of insurance companies pulling in revenue, same with medical, and other service companies than can draw on the bottomless insurance pool. 
A lot of this money in either the service industries or insurance industries also goes toward political lobbying to influence our Government in their favors. None of this is in favor of the people, who would have been better off dealing with no insurance and much lower base service costs (building up personal savings would be a lot easier without insurance payments), but so long as this dynamic exists, a person cannot risk going on without insurance, as it could lead to financial ruin, and it is often mandated by law to be subscribed to various insurances (likely thanks to those lobbyists).
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:35:08
That remains to be seen quite honestly. I can tell you that anyone who has been disciplined in utilizing a dollar cost averaging strategy frequently with Bitcoin should have no problem having a few buys up at 20k and more the entire way down, assuming they also got their buys in while the bubble was just beginning. The build up took a long time, the peak was very brief. 
Even better of course would be selling the whole stack at 20k and resetting the strategy, but then there's the matter of short term capital gains. What we should all really want is piece of mind in our growth, not perfection, and you don't really need that lambo (especially not when the tax burden hits)
Saving via getting paid in dollars doesn't exactly come with the gains that BTC does, in fact dollars in your savings account are essentially destined to only lose value over time.
So basically, big ups come with at least some down.

Perhaps it implies that people could do well to restrict their spending. If people want something desperately enough as a Bitcoin user, they will spend some BTC, if they don't particularly need anything, they will just hold/save, or buy things with fiat holdings (a less desirable form of money). Don't worry, if things get bad enough people will spend BTC for goods, but for now the fiat system of most countries is functional, might as well use it.
Bitcoin is not responsible for running countries, it does not have a "credibility debt" to be concerned over, all of Bitcoin's numbers are in order. It is the honey badger, and will go on regardless of what happens. If the situation with fiat currency changes, that is when BTC spending will increase.

Banks do not verify any transactions within open blockchains like Bitcoin (unless they have become a miner, but would still only be a small piece of the overall network). They have no power censoring transactions like they can in their closed systems. So the only thing that is within their power is sending fiat to 3rd party exchanges and other services that help people buy before they take ownership of their own keys. Or sell and get fiat back to their account. On ramps and off ramps basically. 
There will always be ways to buy/sell/earn crypto however, people find many ways to circumvent banks or just find competitors that will do it for you while taking your money away from the unreasonable bank, so it would be futile for them to fight in this way, many have tried in various countries around the world and it never really seems to matter or stick.

The issue is that the people in charge of systems that powerful have a God complex, and I will not put faith in it, nor do I have to. You are trusting human beings with an immense task, and you should know that power corrupts us. Neither of us know what the *many* crashes in the US/Global economy in the past 100 years would have been like without this great "mitigation" ability, but I think humanity would have survived just fine. The fed is also likely responsible in part for many of them in the first place, and they almost certainly will be for the next one.
And inflation? They have not contained it, they just shift it around, export it away, and pressure everyone to take on significant debts, it certainly still seems to be hitting our young people harder than ever these days.
Bitcoin came down 80% over a year, and yet it is still up nearly 400% over two years, that is after losses. That's called better performance mate. And the price is not going to stop the actual system from functioning, which is far more important than some comparative value measure. Bitcoin worked when it was worth pennies, it works now, and it will work 10-100 years from now. Best part, no one is in control, which is why there is no means to stop it, and no God complex at the top.

Indeed, Steemit has a system which is not like Bitcoin. And while it does seem off, I think it may be on to something. People should read the whitepaper if they want to really understand. Basically steem is highly inflationary in order to keep it pegged to the US dollar (1 steem dollar = ~$1 via minting new steem automatically to pay content creators and curators), the caveat is that everyone involved is incentivized to convert steem to steem power in order to increase voting weight, which will help the user earn more steem dollars when active on the site. This effectively traps the vast majority of supply in steam power, which cannot be converted back to steem for 2 years. So while steem is openly traded, it has a bias to the upside or sideways, because most are buying steem to lock it up, though traders will still trade. It's less about making money from currency appreciation, and more about creating and curating content. As steem dollars are not locked up.
Sites like reddit and facebook generate billions of dollars from content that users create, but the content creators get nothing, the company and shareholders take that wealth. Steemit could have the potential to be a kind of balanced system capable of spreading this kind of wealth to those who are really creating value. Because it's crypto, everyone involved is a kind of shareholder. Not to mention, this thing is already popular and is attracting a lot of attention, so most likely there are other means for the developers to receive other revenue streams. 
It could blow up in a bad way, 2 years from now would definitely be interesting, but if it survives and thrives that long I suspect the early adopters would rather keep their steem power rolling. Even if it did fail eventually, there is money to be made now.

Do you understand that a payment can simply be requested for an exact amount? The customer can just scan a QR code and send what is being requested for their specific purchase. 
If not using that method, they’ll simply need to know what their own money means when making a deal, just as in the US we know what pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and dollars are worth. It’s the same thing, just using something more like a metric system. 
Again their wallet can also calculate what each unit is worth in a fiat currency at any given time so that it is clear.

Organically it is mostly people who want to find out what Bitcoin is that would be searching "Bitcoin", if everyone on the planet became fully educated about it and now just go directly to the Bitcoin related websites they use day in and day out, would it be "not good" that there's no longer much organic need for the search?
