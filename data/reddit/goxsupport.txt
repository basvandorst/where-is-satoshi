Relax guys. Everything is cool.

Neverrrrrrrrrr 
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:24:23
Go boss! Wave like a boss!
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:47:15
here I am. Whats up?
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:44:22
BFL makes gox look good.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:06:53
Because we are *THE*  **best** ^at ^taking ^your ^money. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:01:36
as long as someone brings lattes
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:35:32
I resist the urge to egg these guys daily from my office window.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:12:10
Tomorrow. Coffee shops are easy. Dem programmingz are hard.
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:55:05
Right? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:08:26
I know, I feel like I'm part of something huge, like Enron.
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:18:34
I have been telling you guys for weeks. Cocaine and hookers.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:17:50
Yeah. We just work here. We don't speak the ching chang talk.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:12:36
of 2017...
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:16:16
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:57:17
Thank you, we go to great lengths to not only infuriate our customers, but we like to give them the tools to make giant asses out of themselves too. 
Also we go to great lengths to only spend your bitcoins on the highest quality prostitutes and cocaine.
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:52:58
Thank you kindly.
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:09:15
Woah, you're putting words in my mouth man. I can't make it any more clear that we obviously don't give a fuck about you. 
The only reason we're fixing this issue is so we don't go to jail. Nothing more.
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:28:09
everyone knows about rypple the same way everyone knows about VD.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:48:30
Something about Gokkusu...is Gokkusu Gox? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:22:13
We kinda like you too. We like you, like you...
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:14:03
Safely in my pocket. Being spent appropriately.
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:19:04
Hi guys hows it going? My name is GoxSupport. I am here to assist any way I can. No you cannot have your money back. Yes we spent your money elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-03-02 06:23:28
That's cute that you think I need to work, ever again.
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:48:22
I'm packing right now for the nearest country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with any major countries.
We're cutting and running with your money in the morning.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:39:47
I know what CRipple is yes.
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:10:27
You'd be surprised what kind of anonymity several thousand BTC can buy...
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:57:53
I can't believe you guys trusted us with the coins. We're rich now. Sure Mark will be in jail, but we will be here with open arms when he gets out &lt;3
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:12:30
You fool. Every day is free latte day. Do you want chaos at Gox? You know how he gets without his latte.
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:17:16
the problem is that ordering caviar by the metric ton is easier said than done.

As long as we stay on the BF nothing will change.
**THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS** 
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:44:37
I feel for you. Here let me tip you in dogecoin.
*Mt.Gox does not support DogeCoin* 
Oh right. Too bad. Suck it.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:10:47
Answer: Fuck you
Answer: Fuck you, we're keeping your money. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:15:34
I actually am tasked with injecting several needles full of silicon into his thighs daily. Mark is convinced he is a large heavy set black woman complete with the attitude. In a few years he will be darkening his skin and coming out as the black female michael jackson.
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:07:52
I've been telling you guys for months now. Cocaine and hookers. 
DAT MONEY IS GONE.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:04:13
Lesson: People will still give us money.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:10:59
How many bitcoins did you lose? 
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:22:48
You know what was not very productive but highly profitable for some people? Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:51:27
You spelled his last name wrong. Obvious troll is obvious.
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:37:03
Gox is in Japan. Idiot.
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:35:52
IT'S NOT OH FUCKING KAYYYYYY
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:41:51
Only the finest hoes.
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:13:36
IDK BRO I JUST STEAL THE COINS
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:12:07
I have 424 karma points. I demand respect.
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:13:26
Sure just send me the coins first. and i'll take care of duh rest.
@_date: 2014-03-02 07:17:59
How many bitcoins we spent on Hookers and Cocaine.
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:38:54
Someone else already did. No complaints here. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:06:51
Hi Guys. Goxsupport here! Sorry for stealing your money!
Lol. Notttt
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:35:40
All I'll say is that Mt.Gox isn't the only one that blows.
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:36:01
I make a fort out of my money every night. It helps me sleep.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:06:06
Mt.Gox uses a very high end platform for profit insurance regarding employees. 
It's called, "take as much as you can and run for the hills."
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:55:54
Just a simple answer. ALL TEH MONIES!!! MUHAHAHAHAHHA
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:31:21
Sure! Just send me 5 BTC as a transfer payment for our Nigerian transfer station and we will reach out and send your 1000BTC within 3 hours after that time. 
The prince of Nigeria
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:49:12
Lattes. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:17:40
Are we huffing paint thinner? Yes.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:54:02
I can confirm the coins were found. All coins have been accounted for. 
They were promptly spent on Bitstamp and we will be cashing out soon. Cocaine, hookers, and the finest latte's money can buy. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:32:45
I'm sorry to hear you had trouble. I'll go ahead and undelete this account for you. I'll also be sure to sign you up for our hourly newsletter.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:05:25
I spend many hours staring at the mound of man fantasizing about him. I wish it was painted on, it's just so skin tight.
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:56:20
can confirm this is an accurate logo.
@_date: 2014-02-24 10:10:53
I think this thread is full of crap.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:42:32
We'll just pay them off. Again. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:35:05
psh shut up. we're awesome.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:03:24
NO DUDE EVERYTHING IS OKAY! IF YOU QUESTION ME YOU SUPPORT TERRORISM!
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:25:07
I assure you that Mt.Gox is not solvent. Especially after my bender tonight. Whooo baby gotta spend money to make money right?
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:31:18
mmmm baby, I'd give it to you for free with a name like that.
@_date: 2014-02-19 10:39:01
[Fuck you.]( 
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:27:59
Wow the bossman really shoulda clocked that loser. The audacity of this person to ask for their rightfully earned bitcoins from the organization. 
I don't know why people think they should have a right to their money. *Morons*. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:13:47
It's very simple. Funnel coins out of Gox through private channels. Send them to Coinbase wallets and cash out.
How do you think I got so fucking rich you stupid morons. I can't believe you trusted us with your money.
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:48:13
I hope they use Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:31:01
I have a hickey that says otherwise, hint: it's not on my neck. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 09:45:12
u dont believe me bro?
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:15:01
Cut and run works for our politicians. Why not for us?
@_date: 2014-10-16 00:12:22
Bossman in the house.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:09:03
Mt.Gox is a symptom of that free market. We're just swooping on all of dem coins and blasting off to the moon with them while we rob you blind &lt;3. No one is gonna stop us cuz, no one cares about you poor schmucks.
@_date: 2014-02-19 11:07:44
I don't know anyone that pays for porn except for my CEO. He has piles and piles of it in his office. He really likes magazines..
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:37:57
Logic went out the window a long time ago. Cocaine and hookers run our lives. Eventually we will code a fix.
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:28:25
The situation is that WE GOT YOUR MONEY BITCHESSSSS. 
Nothing you can do about it. We might put a fix together, maybe. Beg for it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:43:58
Gox Support here. Do you want to know how we stole the money? Or do you want to know which prostitutes we purchased? I can't give you our cocaine guy because he doesn't like new faces.
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:52:43
I am definitely real. Send me your passwords and private keys and I'll get your money out of Gox. /s
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:14:48
You've already lost several nights worth of sleep over us tanking the price. What's 2 more minutes?
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:37:31
Finally, someone gets it.
@_date: 2014-02-19 09:51:33
We had to defeat misty to get into the gym in the towers...
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:14:03
A lattue?
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:29:47
nu uh!
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:55:36
Nah. We are opening our own cafe in our building. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:44:17
I do, I don't work there or anything. Promise. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 10:11:00
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:43:50
ノーファック TALK AMERICAN
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:13:38
This guy knows what's up. We'll be back in 6 months with a new website owned by us anonymously. 
How else did you think this was going to play out? we're bitcoinaires.
@_date: 2014-02-15 22:17:27
I am Gox's PR department. Please direct all legitimate questions to me. 
I am definitely not a novelty account.
@_date: 2014-02-17 06:44:55
uh whatloll bro we be taking ur coins.
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:34:17
Hookers and cocaine.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:16:38
We taking your money bitches
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:39:06
Shhhh quiet.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:13:11
the day before the day after yesterday plus 8?
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:59:55
I just got assigned my own body guard and driver in our new office. Their names and Frank and Phil.
@_date: 2014-02-16 09:10:12
Both of you are mistaken. I am obviously the legit Mt. Gox support and you definitely shouldn't upvote all of my posts and comments. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:32:43
We are doing the same amount of work we always do. 
-20 minutes of gazing at the CS queue and not answering questions
-Allowing a few small transactions go through to give users false hope
-Selecting dwaves for our midget tossing league
-Finding out what kind of endangered tree I want to use for my custom made desk
-planning the gox christmas party
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:07:02
Like you're ever going to get them back from us...
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:16:02
it wont..
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:42:42
He could learn a little from Gox. At least take your website down, jeez.
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:16:00
Mt.Gox is perfect. What are you guys talking about?! Just because we held your money through and caused the largest mini-crash in Bitcoin lately.....
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:55:01
I'm excited. In the Japanese tradition I think it would be more appropriate if you would sumo wrestle me. 
Then we eat sushi and drink sake. 
I don't know a Mr. Clean, is he like Mr. Sparkle?
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:18:45
We are currently adding a Gox premium section to our site. Send us an additional $50 in BTC and we will send you a handwritten note from Mark explaining how much we are spending on cocaine.
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:49:14
No!!!! EXCHANGES ARE THE ONLY WAY TO GO!
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:58:50
NOOOOOOOOO MY PORN STASH!!!!!!!!! GIVE IT BACK!
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:46:53
I'll ask him when I'm over there lady. Have you ever been to a bitcoin cocaine orgy? Bitches love coincaine.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:37:25
Someone translate for me so I can provide a snappy comeback.
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:31:31
Lies. The sky is falling.
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:42:57
hence why it costs so much! 
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:49:21
Bro. I don't think you understand how to internet. Or how to humor. 
I'm just trying to tell you. We're stealing everyone's money and buying a brothel in Zimbabwe. We'll all be riddled with AIDS in 3 years. But hey, we're rich. Who cares?
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:14:41
I have such a weird boner right now.
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:16:44
You're all gonna be fine. Just because your coins are worth 1/3 of market value and you can't even touch them......
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:31:04
Yes. We should be more professional. Like bankers stealing trillions of dollars in bailouts professional. 
Gox is doing what it needs to do. Sure, some people have lost piles of bitcoin. But we are getting a new cafe. So it's all good.
@_date: 2014-02-19 09:44:33
The Heliport has been completed, but we had to custom order a freight helicopter that can lift our CEO.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:31:03
Why anything?
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:49:41
If they are gullible enough to be tricked into giving us money then they should learn a lesson in reading comment history and general research.
@_date: 2014-02-12 10:45:36
Thanks everyone. While we steal your money we just want to let you know that gox is there for you. And it was all bitcoin's fault. That moron, Satoshi. Tsk. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:29:40
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:18:40
Psh. Like we ever have to work again.
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:30:45
Send me your emails and passwords and I will fix everything up for you.
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:59:53
Everything is okay guys. Everyone relax. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 07:18:17
Oh shit. I forgot. Make it 9 months. Now that's a pregnant pause.
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:39:35
@_date: 2014-03-02 07:10:56
Crap is what we aim for.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:14:32
Sure. Not sure what you mean, but sure.
@_date: 2014-02-18 07:11:08
those worthless coins? hahahaha!
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:53:35
frappucino flavored?
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:13:47
Yes. Obviously. I'll tell you what we're not investing in. Social Media. Someone could have come right along and registered the account without being part of Gox.
I am very glad that  ^didn't happen. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:15:57
As I stated yesterday we're all packing and leaving for the nearest non-extradition friendly country before our announcement monday mornings. The announcement will probably come pool-side from some small 3rd world country that accept bitcoin in exchange for anonymity and aslyum. 
We will continue living out our days there surrounded by drugs and prostitutes paid for with your good fortune.
Gox and friends should really take a moment to say thank you for making this possible.
Fuck you. Fuck you. Thanks for the money. Fuck you fuck you and FUCK YOU.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:17:22
That's a programming language right? I'm going to say. Yes. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 08:15:03
Definitely Mt.Gox...
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:51:27
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:23:25
No. Send me your bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:38:45
Mt.Gox is never going out of business. We will keep accepting your coins as long as you're dumb enough to give them to us.
@_date: 2014-02-15 23:40:27
I would like to assure everyone that we will not be donating this to any charities such as Sean's outpost. We were inspired by the wolf of Wall Street and plan to have a dwarf tossing league. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 10:02:09
All the tea in china.
@_date: 2014-02-19 09:57:18
It's really nice. Private entrance. Away from any protesters. 
And we're going to have security. **NINJA** security. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:13:48
I'll sell you this TinFoil hat for 100000000000 MT Gox Bitcoin. You'll never get to cash out. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:33:16
dude that sucks im so sorry. maybe you should try using gox.
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:53:17
lots and lots
@_date: 2014-02-18 07:19:07
what do you mean after? we're planning to steal for many years to come. why do you think we opened up a cafe?
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:27:21
Hi Guys! Thanks for waiting on hold. We appreciate your patience in our telling you to fuck off.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:23:02
No doubt. We are. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 01:49:35
And cocaine.
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:19:19
Guys. Guys. Guys. Just because I ordered a solid gold toilet last week does not mean we are not keeping track of our books and/or stealing funds. I've consulted with my several expensive attorneys from my yacht and I'm quite sure that gox is solvent. 
you faggots need to stop acting like you own your money. it's OURS. Fuck off.
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:24:54
I love how our dev team is just TEASING you guys. LOL. You're never gonna see your coins again. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 11:00:13
Relax guys. We're just moving somewhere with bullet proof glass and a private entrance away from protestors. Because in about a week, we're going to announce insolvency.
You heard it here first. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:15:49
LOLOL. You guys will never see your funds again. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:56:31
PM me for a payment address.
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:52:12
You discovered our secret...
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:53:22
no!!! stop telling them the truth!
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:16:35
Neenerneenerneener bitches.
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:42:42
I welcome you to try...some hookers and cocaine.
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:14:23
Why would you want me to take it out? Don't you want me to just...put it in you?
