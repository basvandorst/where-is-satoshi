1 month ago we got down to $5,500...I can barely even remember it now...

Your FIAT is insured, not any coins.

No i'm just sick of these cringy "HODL" memes and this MS paint garbage. Making memes out of a currency is just dumb and this lambo nonsense is just cringy... When I think bitcoin now, I just see guys in their late 20s trying to get rich without working and hoping this is finally their answer

Yes, let's use a Chinese govt created app to store out Bitcoin. Perfect.
@_date: 2018-05-26 08:41:03
I want to sell all my crypto just to avoid all this cringe...
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:31:11
I agree but I'd have to wait a few days to transfer funds...at that point the price could change largely. Or am I using gdax wrong 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:46:40
Yeah but there's no USD on my coinbase account. Still takes a few days to clear from bank account, right ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:21:29
Fuck you, why should we do ALL the work for you, you lazy cunt? You come on here and even demand it?
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:10:37
Okay. I'm just telling him why people keep money in banks and not under their mattress. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:13:43
You can use coinbase, and then transfer to a wallet like electrum. No problem. There was only like one instance of a bank closing account because of Bitcoin stuff, and to be honest, I didn't even believe it, so don't worry.

No, they also do it for safety. If you keep all your cash in your home and it's stolen/burns down - it's gone.
If it's in a bank, and the same thing happens to them , your money is always safe thru the FDIC.

You're a fool.

"I finally saw (1) another lunatic like us using Bitcoin to buy stuff! Adoption is real!"

Sorry about your loss, stinky chinky.

Mate don't waste your entire $40 investment on tshirts lol

What portfolio is this
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:58:21
Okay just wanted to be sure
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:20:00
Agreed. It's weird to see Bitcoin memes and uninformed people. Justembarassing. This sub has made the image of Bitcoin far worse.
@_date: 2018-07-06 08:50:00
It's why I don't follow this sub anymore. It's a lot of people pretending they are part of a greater cause but really in it for the money and menes.
