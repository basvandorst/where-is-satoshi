Yeah this subreddit is a joke when bitcoin gets a little of attention: memes, pictures, half assed discussions and articles, over hype...

Exchanges don't run out of stock, that's not how it works

Every exchange should stay solvent as long as it's correctly managed and that no fraud is occurring, you can assume otherwise but I don't see the point.
Also I believe we're in bubble territory, hype has reached new all time highs (as seen on google trend and bitcoin wikipedia pageviews) and price will top out at maximum x20 fold increase from the last bear period low, which is about 20x$150. We'll maybe see 4k but that would really be as high as it would go before anything significant is announced.

It's an estimate, and my guess is as good as yours as no one can predict the market.
 
This discrepancy makes for huge arbitrage possibilities, the gap might get narrower as more traders get in.

Well I'm not going for millions anyway heh (or I'm I?). Didn't thought of mobile pics! Right now I'll have to wait over the weekend, I need an activation code for the wire transfer posted by mail, gaaah.

report that shit

Dude you gave me the only laugh of my fucking sorry day, sincerely thanks.

Yeah, looks really easy to use and clean which is nice. The tier-thingy is bothering me though, is seems to be a tedious process to get through before trading.
Edit: NOPE! It's processing tier 1 which is enough for now. I think ima start with Kraken, thanks.

Well that's pretty shitty, I can't photocopy my ID and I don't have verification papers right now. I guess they're out.     
You're not obliged to meet people in Localbitcoins, but it's not as easy to use as others I guess.    
Thanks for the input.
Edit: Ninja'd

Streisand effect is the shit.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:51:41
Yeah its the biggest by far but I can't do the ID check right now, too bad heh. Thanks anyway!
