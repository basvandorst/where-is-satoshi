Yeah so many places accepting bitcoin these days especially online stores... there’s this business called ozdingo online store from which I bought a massager the other day with $LTC even... I guess mass adoption coming no question about it!
@_date: 2019-03-31 08:31:01
It’s already happening and applies to many cases already 
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:11:05
And people still trust Banks ��!!!!!!!!! I dont understand  ����‍♂️����‍♂️����‍♂️����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-03-30 13:17:26
Epic art piece �� 
@_date: 2019-03-18 10:11:43
I’ll send you a picture next time it pops up in front of me �� let’s not even get started on Australia banks robbing people they were even taking fees from dead people’s bank accounts!
@_date: 2019-03-18 05:51:18
In Australia some ATMs charge 2.5%!!!! Imagine that!
@_date: 2019-03-28 05:45:42
People are dumb
@_date: 2019-03-05 07:28:52
Nice 
@_date: 2018-10-21 09:53:53
Whatever happened to the world since then !
@_date: 2018-10-20 09:04:12
Ha! It’s what it represents not the actual look of it �� you’re right doesn’t look too good ����‍♂️
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:07:36
Omg I know ��‍♂️ was trying to convey a message here

On May 22, 2010, now known as Bitcoin Pizza Day, Laszlo Hanyecz agreed to pay 10,000 Bitcoins for two delivered Papa John's pizzas! (Source Investopedia) I think that is the day it should be!
@_date: 2018-10-25 10:23:12
And more stable! Acting like a stable coin should and holding steady while “conventional” markets crash! Long $BTC
@_date: 2019-03-15 09:45:19
Whatever pushes BTC up is fine with all of us! I don’t understand why the negative comments it’s funny �� 
@_date: 2018-10-25 10:25:29
The first pizza transaction where $BTC was accepted as a source of payment for a real word asset is the date!

Nice one ☝�� 
@_date: 2019-02-28 11:31:10
So how can all people in the world still trust the untrustable ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:50:13
Only way is up
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:40:20
Try reading the history of banking and the current f up fractional reserve banking system... wake up people
@_date: 2019-06-14 07:06:01
@_date: 2019-06-07 07:00:47
Where’s that? London?
@_date: 2019-02-28 11:16:20
“Backed by” means “value created from” not value created “for” which is the case for what you say...
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:37:23
How much interest do you pay on a loan? How much fees do you pay when you take out your own money from an ATM? How many fees admin fees setup fees etc do you pay? All the time. And no one asks why... banks are merely transactional in today’s technology... we don’t need them anymore wake up!
@_date: 2019-02-27 20:44:12
What do you mean? I thought it’s brilliant to buy so many things with bitcoin. And what do you mean about Coinbase commerce can bend over? Lives will soon be filled? Isn’t the whole point of crypto is to be able to buy stuff and mainly online? If some stores are allowing it now and using coinbase commerce then why wouldn’t you agree that it’s a good thing I don’t understand...
@_date: 2019-12-31 06:52:15
Love the quick hey hey heeeeey I can even hear it!

How did you find this? Is he/she tagged here now? Isn’t it amazing!!!
@_date: 2019-04-10 21:19:18
Yeah but what if BTC miners move to mining other more profitable coins? ⛏ since the BTC price does not justify the cost anymore?
@_date: 2019-04-03 10:54:30
You mean US government tender debt bills?
@_date: 2019-04-03 11:55:24
Yeah I know Fractional banking it used to be 80% now it’s as low as 5%!!! Enough is enough!
@_date: 2019-04-03 11:54:19
Exactly my point thanks for confirming it seems like everyone around me is dumb and doesn’t see all this!
@_date: 2019-04-23 07:33:18
$6k will take a while ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:59:46
Nah not asking short term and not for trading tbh... it’s just to understand what more or less mining does to the value of the coin especially when majority of the coins are already mined

@_date: 2019-01-12 11:30:42

Should I make it?
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:26:59
It’s the result of federal bank reserve brain washing over the years
