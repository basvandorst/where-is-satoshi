Better routing models can and will be implemented. Some might be a bit more centralized, but you are free to invent something even better.
And don't compare a LN 'server' with a webserver or an exchange. If done right with virtual machines and good firewalling or Tor, there is very little to no attack surface except the LN software itself.
Comparable to a bitcoin client connected to the internet. I am running one since 2010, never been hacked.

How would that help? If rules are the same, people with more money will buy more mining power. So nothing changed, just another shitcoin.
If you change rules and try to distribute it equally to everyone on earth, that would only be possible in a very very centralized way. Just another fiat shitcoin.
So just no, won't happen.

This makes no sense at all, what exactly are you saying anyway? 
That if not enough electricity can be produced to mine bitcoin at $0.04 that people or those miners that are lucky enough to be able to buy electricity will just sell their bitcoin below market value?
Electricity price will adjust, or those who are still able to get cheaper than market rate electricity because of government intervention will have a big arbitrage opportunity.
It will be interesting to watch, but people won't stop buying expensive bitcoin or mining only because you say it is not possible.

It will be your first money where you have more control over it than your government.
