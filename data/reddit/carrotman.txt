Why would you want to escape inflation if you're not looking for stability. You're nuts. End of discussion

But the more control you give to a centralized institution, the more all of Bitcoins befenits crumble away. Transactions will take longer and the bank isn't going to do it for free. Imo a bitcoin bank goes against the basic principles of bitcoin. It wouldn't be worse than what we already have with regular banks, but it wouldn't be better either.

I don't think you understand how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:02:57
Can someone give me a short summary of this situation? What happened and why should I give this person money?
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:34:25
Why would you insult me for asking for proof? Go fuck yourself.

More users doesn't necessarily lead to a higher price because Bitcoin can be divided in such small fractions.

What's the purpose then? You can get instant transactions now with Paypal. Transaction fees will be necessary when mining becomes less profitable as we approach 21 million coins. 
No chargebacks is not a benefit to the average consumer, quite the contrary actually.

It took a while to recover after every crash. Give it some time.
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:17:44
Hold your coins folks. To the moon!

That kind of defeats the purpose of Bitcoin though, doesn't it? It's all about decentralisation. If we get Bitcoin banks we're back to square one and there's no longer a benefit over the Dollar or the Euro.

I don't think the equation more adoption = higher price is accurate. The price is high when people are hoarding, not when they are willing to sell BTC for goods.

It might not be difficult for us but in my opinion this is way too complicated to ever be feasible for a wider audience. If Bitcoin wants to go mainstream there has to be an easier way to do this.

Watch [this]( video of a Stanford Seminar on Bitcoin. He mentions similarities of bitcoin and dot.com, but so far bitcoin got stronger after every setback.
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:01:39
I see. Thanks

Calm down, will ya. If you don't own your money on your Paypal account, what's the difference with leaving your coins with a Bitcoin bank. People have lost possession of their coins on Gox already.

Whether this is good news or not depends on what you expect from Bitcoin. If you want to make money through trading this is probably not good because it decreases volatility through the increased volume of coins traded. If you want to use Bitcoin as a payment method this is of course good news.

[No thanks](
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:00:15
Please do that.

What's a bitcoin day?
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:59:26
So that means new year is tommorow.

Dogecoin probably won't replace VISA in stores but it has a future as an internet tipping currency. That's what it's being used for already and it's growing.

Here's some more

Get this man a stylist and he'll be the best spokesperson Bitcoin has ever seen.
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:12:37
It used to be, before it started to die slowly.

Oh you!

Can you explain to me how that would be different from using a regular bank?
Regular bank transactions take this long because banks make a lot of money that way. They could be done in seconds but that wouldn't be profitable for the bank. When a transaction takes 3 days to complete, you're basically giving your bank a free 3-day loan, money they can reinvest and profit from.
I see no reason why bitcoin banks wouldn't do it the same way.
You can choose regular banks now that won't gamble with your money.
If we say Bitcoin is digital cash, and then we give it to banks to take care of it for us, I see no benefit over fiat. You said it's safer from inflation, but that's not much of an issue for any first world country. In fact, considering Bitcoin lost about 15% of it's value in the last couple of days it's probably not your first choice if you're looking for stability.
Bitcoin has its benefits, but when you let banks handle it there's just no difference to fiat anymore.
