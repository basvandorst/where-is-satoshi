I mean, the resistance is pretty solid, but after losing hard today I'm not going to be the canary.
Edit: Whoops, meant support

Not all countries are the US, and in Canada for instance taxes on currency speculation are half that of income tax.

LTC has proven to trend almost lock-step with BTC since its inception, so as a hedge it's all but irrelevant. It is an incredibly useful coin though...

Well, unless he has the private key he wouldn't be able to access it anyway. But just to be safe he should run a thorough search for a "wallet.dat" file on his computer.

Half the normal taxes you pay on earnings? You're damn right that's good. Canada has the exact opposite view of winnings and gains vs the US, you pay tax on what you work for, and you keep the lions share of what you win.

You're being trolled. I recommend taking a portion of your disposable income each week and buying whatever small amount of Bitcoin you can afford monthly. This is a long term investment, treat it as a retirement savings that you can draw on without penalty.

When business as usual resumes so too will the usual discussions.

I added BTCCAD=X just now, working perfectly.

Oh I just used RES to force the downvote, much easier:

Whist that may be generally true, when you're facing something that has an overwhelming amount of evidence, and just passively, casually dismissing it without any really sources or evidence in a video about something COMPLETELY unrelated, you are the one on which the burden of truth rests.
I understand you're just playing the devil's advocate, but there can be no concessions made for groundless claims.

Yea, umm... As soon as he said "global warming cults" I completely tuned out, sorry. If you are able to ignore facts like that to further your agenda, then you will do so with the rest of your speech.

What you've built is not default behaviour. You do NOT get go blacklist anything on behalf of users. Linux is for tinkerers and people who like to not be constrained by walled gardens. I don't care if the change can be manually reversed, I shouldn't have to force software to allow me to make my own decisions.

I love mead, but I live in Canada.

Subscribing means validating their obnoxious trolling. RES makes my intentions far easier to convey.

Nope, it uses the same tech as current "tap-to-pay" cards. At least 60% of merchants in Canada have the equipment to handle it already.

The worst part of this bear cycle is putting up with cynics like you.

You're an IT Manager but you have no clue that Android is a flavour of Linux? Linux is the new embedded Java, ambiguous, widespread, and behind the scenes.
