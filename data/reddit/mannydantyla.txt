Black Friday was the begging of the decade long Great Depression haha omg fucking idiots
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:44:30
it's no longer new highs, it's just new lows now :(
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:50:13
what's fake about them?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:13:33
fucking nuts aint it. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:24:05
nailed it
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:39:58
so, it's not "crashed", it's "post only mode." Coinbase said it's to help with liquidity. Like an Initial Coin Offering? ICO
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:23:36
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:00:34
That huge bcash spike? Yeah, coinbase just started allowing BCH buys. Now the sells come next
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:59:45
yes my coworker just said to me, less than 60 seconds ago, "oh look Bitcoin is now less than $4k!"
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:08:13
yeah I didn't mean that you can't, I just meant that people are mostly buying right now. But all the folks who got free bcash are going to sell them, that's what I think anyways
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:54:37
alright, thanks. We're looking at the numbers of the right of the screen? reds are sells and greens are buys?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:24:12
*bcash - but that's part of the problem/scheme
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:34:45
oh I didn't think about that
I plan on HODLing my remaining few BTC (only worth $70 now, it's just play/gambling money) anyways so no biggie
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:19:55
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:14:57
this makes me feel much less stupid for buying at $150 at 18k thank you so much I needed that
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:47:06
what do you think i'll be thinking
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:06:42
my thoughts too. Someone sold BTC big at 2:07pm (New York time) exactly after BCH started trading again
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:18:14
I'm about to buy my first bitcoin. Not a whole bitcoin of course. 
Was about to click "buy it instantly" button on coinbase when I thought maybe I'd check today's price first. After all it does go up and down, or so I'm told
Should I wait or should I click the submit button????
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:33:38
sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell sell 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:39:58
aaaaaaand its gone
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:14:20
I bought some Bitcoin BTC, payed $50 USD, used my debit card which I linked and verified with the coinbase account first. So, this one: 


I guess its not "instant"
[edit] Hey would ya look at that! It's finally showing up in my wallet
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:14:49
check out the depth chart
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:20
hi I'm an idiot and I meant to buy Bcash on coinbase but accidently bought BTC instead. ama
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:33:03
Can you help me understand why my money is not showing up in my coinbase wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:13:55
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:28:37
what's going to happen to the price of BTC when BTC -&gt; BCH trading begins on gdax and coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:41:32
god I hope you're right
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:42:26
ok this is like the 20th time I've seen the word Satoshi.. who/what tf is Satoshi? Also, sorry for being an annoying noob everyone I'm just hyped on coffee and a little left over blow
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:47:21
at least BTC isn't going down anymore. Was hoping it would jump up big after BCH panic sells
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:15:33
well, for a second. then it was saying error, and now it's saying they're temporarily disabled again. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:44:37
so you're speculating
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:18:09
Like I said, I'm an idiot. Doing a little reading now and it looks like there's a buildup of folks trying to sell their BCH and we could be in for a real show. 
Accidently buying BTC instead BCH might have been the best idiot move ever
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:43:42
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:57:05
are you for real?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:30:10
Coinbase rn: "bitcoin transfers [to my bank account] are temporarily disabled"
lol so fucking glad I sold two thirds of my btc two days ago
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:37:21
it's back, i guess
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:16:25
buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:18:11
neither can I (assuming you mean bch) not that I want to
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:28:39
yeah I'm a little perplexed. Has it crashed or are they keeping the price fixed for a while, like an Initial Coin Offering or something??
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:00:45
I'm skeptical. CBS says it's 39 TWh/year. BBC and ArsTechnica says its 32.5 TWh/year. Yet this website, coindaily.co, says it's only a few TWh/year. So which is it? Should we believe the corporate media or a bitcoin "news" website?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:22:24
I was one of those lucky idiots
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:19:07
well, today alone, when BCH goes up, BTC goes down. When BCH goes done, BTC stays steady
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:31:20
maybe wait to buy the BCH till after the "sell wall", on the other hand the last time it crashed the price went up not down after it started trading again, idk. I'd wait
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:20:45
BOOM! Told ya
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:30:08
well it's crashed (more than likely) and the last time it did that, the price jumped up. BCH
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:19:13
well I didn't know that trading was stopped until then, that's why I thought I could buy it a 15:00 UTC
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:02:31
oh it was only $50 and it kept me at work for an extra 5 minutes lol
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:58:25
Yes but what happens if/when bitcoin becomes a key part of the global financial system? 
For example, my fiance works for an insurance company and she informed me that by law they need XX% finances available in cash. The rest? They invest it in other sectors of the economy: stocks, commodities, realestate, etc. 
What happens when the insurance companies start investing in bitcoin? What if the banks start investing in bitcoin. 
All very interesting if you ask me. 
BTW, fuck the man, fuck the bastards in Washington and Wall Street.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:31:25
not me, I wish. I can't buy bcash either, coinbase says we supposidely can at 9am Pacific coast time
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:28:12
now is a good time to buy, honestly. buy when the blood is flowing in the streets, as they say
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:20:06
yeah it is
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:14:17
I understand the theory but I'm not a goddam cryptology wizard. I actually have a BS in Computer Science but I still don't fully know how the blockchains and hashs work -- yet. Like, my understanding is that the sequence of letters and numbers IS the bitcoin. But then how do you deal with partial bitcoins?? Also, all the sarcasm and insider jokes on reddit don't help lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:43:10
Yeah I bought only a few hundred and now it's all I'm doing is looking at the ups and downs and looking at r/bitcoin. I kinda want to sell and get out just to stop thinking about it
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:56:06
damn I'm an idiot for buying yesterday. Decided randomly that that was the day to see what all the bitcoin fuss was about
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:54:06
1% fluctuations aside, of course. 15% fluctuations are the norm now
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:49:56
I bought my first bitcoin yesterday, $50 worth (that's the minimum on coinbase)
$2 in fees
Whats with all the fee hysteria?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:37:27
ok that helps my understanding a lot, thank you
so, bcash took existing bitcoins ("forked" them), increased their block size limits, and renamed them "bitcoin cash." Correct? Even close?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:38:22
and the sell wall at $17k earlier this month was like $2k USD
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:17:46
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:36:40
9am Pacific coast time. That's what I read too
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:57:05
its the "gold standard" of cryptocurancies but is not actually the best one. I know fucking zilch when it comes to cryptocurancy math, and I'm not a dummy I have a degree is computer science, but from my limited understanding Ethereum is better. (right?)
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:43:28
lol seriously though, North Korea is going to try and dump a ton of BTC maybe that's a good thing not a bad thing. Till they come for my wallet on coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:41:04
its called gambling
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:57:30
\^\^\^\^ fear fuckery
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:15:00
You need to see is what you need to do ffs
@_date: 2018-11-03 00:40:11
This is what I want to do!!!!
