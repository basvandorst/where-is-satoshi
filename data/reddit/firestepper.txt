I'm having a hard time finding any info on Segwit other than it's a fork? Basically i've been a pretty passive btc holder for the past year, are there other exchanges/an easy guide to follow that explains what it is and how I can use it?

Doesn't matter... still got gold.

Lol when people say this. Counselors and parents say if you're undecided on your major you should "do what you enjoy". How is someone who is 18 years old going to know what the job market is supposed to be like in 4-5 years and what they should be studying.

TLDR: FED and goldman sachs are butt buddies. FED accidentally hires someone who wants to do job and regulate banks, that person gets fired by FED when they tried to do their job. Tapes reveal all of this

thats hilarious I remember that guy. Hopefully he sticks around haha.

The federal reserve is the banks bitch and one woman is the hero we need
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:41:03
I didn't say they weren't afraid to back down to the banks. What I meant to say was that they were recommended to start hiring people like that.  
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:21:25
How does that mean the opposite? I was trying to say that the report said the FED should hire people who are strong willed enough to not succumb to pressure from their superiors and the banks.

it's actually really interesting and you should take the time to listen if you have the chance but I'll do my best to summarize:
 After the financial meltdown, the Federal Reserve conducted a study on itself because they were shocked at how they could have missed the signs leading up to it. One of the recommendations of the report was to hire people like Carmen Segarra, outspoken, intelligent and independent minded. Basically people who aren't afraid to back down to the banks. She recorded many meetings and conversations and uncovered systemic cultural problems in the federal reserve and Goldman Sachs. After listening to the tapes, the fundamental problem that exists is that the FED has no backbone when standing up to the banks. When Carmen tried to enforce her regulatory duties and basically do the job they hired her for, they fired her. This paragraph isn't a substitute for listening but I hope it helps.

I would like to see a google wallet service that makes it really easy to spend bitcoins on the internet. Almost like a wallet that's simpler than anything that is currently available. Or you could use a wallet that is an internet browser itself where your wallet info is saved securely and when you are just browsing you could just hit BUY and it already knows your address info.

good luck getting your order...
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:23:29

Seriously. I got tipped some DOGE once and i had to spend like 4 days downloading the blockchain, and then when I tried to get the tip the client got corrupted or something and so I couldn't even open up the Doge wallet thing. Maybe it's just not meant to be for me lol...
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:34:27
