Fair point, that has completely slipped my mind.

The first ones went for 1 BTC, which was a little over 100 USD at the time if I recall correctly.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't it be safer in your case to split it 3 out of 4 with you keeping 2 parts? That way the other two trusted parties couldn't work together to spend your stored money. Maybe I'm just misunderstanding.

You enter the pin on your computer, but the computer doesn't know which button represents which number, you have to reference the Trezor display for that. And since the numbers are always randomly re-arranged, key logging is not an issue. At least that's how I understood it.

Except a thirty dollar increase of Ethereum corresponds to a 300% return on your purchase. Don't dismiss it so readily.
I am invested in both BTC and ETH, and I don't understand this us vs. them mentality - both have their purpose and uses, struggles and advantages.

Over the years I kept gently prodding at my friends and letting them know that this was something worth looking at. The first time when it was around 100. They never listened. Every time the price goes up, they complain about missing out. But what they never do is pull the trigger and just buy some. There's only so much I can do for them, I give up.

Hah, if only. I hope it's soon, don't appreciate my funds being held hostage. Especially during such a volatile time for Bitcoin.

I feel for you. I've been trying for the past couple of weeks to complete the regular ID verification by submitting my ID card photos, and I can't seem to get through to them.
Apparently they want a passport, which I don't have. What the hell...
@_date: 2017-04-15 03:29:52
No, I'm not from China. Which is exactly why they want me to provide a passport instead of an ID card apparently.
I've contacted customer support and apparently I will be able to get my BTC out once withdrawals are enabled again, but I won't be able to trade anymore due to being unable to complete the verification. *shrug* Plenty of other places to go.

It's a good way to get rid of the rest.

Hmm... Financial independence and freedom from government manipulation or a new graphics card so you can continue wasting time, but with more FPS? I pity the shortsighted idiots who want crypto to die because they want a new graphics card on a whim and don't have the patience to let the hardware market stabilise a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:48:36
My response was not talking about you specifically, it is just a follow up on the discussed topic. I see people on gaming subreddits constantly bashing crypto and claiming they hope it dies.
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:08:08
Except when it comes to blurring the username.
@_date: 2017-05-01 02:34:45
Shouldn't take that long to try all ~2000 possible words if only the last one is missing. I don't think that would be secure enough.
@_date: 2017-05-01 02:36:19
Try the bedroom first.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:45:02
How is this even remotely comparable?
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:53:53
Trezor operates so that it is safe to use on a compromised machine. At no point does the computer know the PIN, and all transactions have to be verified on the Trezor itself prior to signing them.
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:37:08
Nothing sensitive is ever transmitted or displayed on the computer. The PIN is entered in a randomized blank numeric keypad and you use the Trezor display as reference so you know where to click. The signing of a transaction occurs on Trezor, the computer only broadcasts the signed transaction. Before you sign a transaction, you can review it on the Trezor screen.
