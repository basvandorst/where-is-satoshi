As someone looking to buy in living in New Zealand I’d really like to get a better understanding of why the price fluctuates so much in countries that don’t have direct access to the big exchanges. 
 why isn’t this just balanced by the market? Could someone in the US not just buy from Coinbase and sell on a New Zealand/Korean exchange and guarantee profit?

Right, that last paragraph is pretty key, I didn't stop to think that Nzd rate could actually drop to meet the usd. The gap on localbitcoins is insane at the moment, roughly 3,000usd above the market price. As a beginner it's hard to grasp how a currency (much more a crypto) can be have such variance in its value across different sellers.

Ok, what do you mean "before you have a chance"? 
Finding this all very helpful so thank you!

So if I am looking to buy in from New Zealand it would be smart to wait for the current large fluctuations to end? So that I’m not paying such a big mark up for paying in NZD?

Done on a large enough scale could you not then just sell those KRW back to USD and use it to pay your rent etc. Then reinvest the leftovers into bitcoin and continue to cycle its through Korea?
