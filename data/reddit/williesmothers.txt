* ["Yes, \[we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,\] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own."]( - Satoshi Nakamoto

I'd be surprised if central banks didn't put up a fight, but, when people have a choice, they'll hold the money that tends to go up in value over time. The central bank monopoly on money is showing cracks, which is good for everyone but those monopolists.

The user experience is mostly terrible at the points where fiat and crypto interface. Those companies are beholden to money service business and money transmission laws which require anti money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) procedures. Combine that with the amount of fraud that happens in the credit card world and you have a recipe for a terrible UX. 
Once you're in the crypto world, it's MUCH easier, however, not perfect. We're at the point where the internet was decades ago. That'll get sorted in time.

Companies will definitely have to follow regulations. But users have the choice to use the technology or to use a company. The companies are needed right now to enter the crypto economy. Once you're in, you can just use the technology and avoid all regulated companies if you choose. 


I guess you don't recall the days before DNS when you had to use IP addresses to access websites/servers. Or maybe the days of waiting for someone to get off the phone so you could dial in to your ISP for an internet connection. 
Additional protocol layers like the lightning network will fix these problems. Mainstream adoption won't happen until then, so, unless you're brave and patient, steer clear for a few more years.

It's not that simple. For example, if you have the choice, which money would you prefer to hold? The one that rises in value over time or the one that falls? 
Governments love having a monopoly on money because they can devalue/inflate it. But monopolies can't exist when there is competition through choice.

An attacker gains a significant advantage in brute forcing your seed by having a portion of it. Instead, you should use Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme to generate multiple seeds in a multi-signature configuration that works for your situation (2 of 3; 5 of 7; 10 of 15; etc.). You then share those seeds with family members. If you die or lose your original seed, your family members can assemble the proper number of seeds to recover the original. 
Here is an example:

I think the point is that we will have already soft forked to using quantum resistant cryptography, and most bitcoin owners will have moved their coins to the new address scheme. Those who haven’t/can’t will lose their vulnerable coins. So what percentage of coins will that be? And the more important question is, how much has bitcoin been adopted? If nearly everyone is using it and it’s become the global reserve currency, there’s much less incentive to dump the recovered hordes. So maybe it won’t be too disruptive.

I am not calling their business model disengenous because of its effect on me -- I understood there was risk and I limited my exposure by selecting a brawker user with 14 positive reviews and 0 negative. Their response is to simply use the card immediately so the gift card vendor is defrauded rather than their users. The fact that their advice is to push the risk to an innocent third party is unethical in my opinion.

Thanks for chiming in. The problem is that Tuition.io "gift cards" don't operate like Amazon gift cards. Someone buys a Tuition.io gift card for you and then when you're ready to spend it (e.g. when your tuition bill is due), they make an ACH payment on your behalf. So even if I had applied the "gift card" immediately to initate the ACH payment, Tuition.io would still experience the scammer's charge back.
I created another ticket and I appreciate your time.
I'll update here with any outcome.

I used Brawker to buy a gift card which I didn't spend immediately. The charge was reversed and the gift card invalidated. When I contacted Brawker, they informed me that I needed to spend the gift card immediately to avoid being scammed. Essentially they said that the charge back is the gift card vendor's probem so long as I don't hold the gift card any longer than necessary. Their business model is unethical and they should be avoided because scammers are all over that site with fake credit cards.

Take a look at the chart I linked and you'll see that's not true. The 2011 run did greater than a 32x within months. I don't know when you want to use as the basis for the current run but let's go back to $200:  32 × $200 = $6,400. And if we do reach that amount on this run, that's over the course of years. If you were to calculate back just a few months before that large run in 2011, the price was 10¢. From 10¢ to $32 is a 320x gain! Sadly, I don't think we'll be repeating those rises ever again.
