My point is that there is no way to determine if there're too few, too many, or just enough.
Markets only determine what the group of people that participate in them believe the value to be at that moment. The participants don't have uniform information access and rarely behave rationally.

Transaction times are a complete non-issue.
Bitcoin is 10 minutes on average, tradition financial settlement is 2 DAYS.
Credit card non-reversible transaction times are 3-6 months, and when reversed result in an immediate balance reduction of original amount plus $30+ fee for the vendor, who is then allowed to attempt to prove their innocense.
I believe that Bitcoin's technical challenges are being met by the best developers, by far, involved in cryptocurrency who way not always give everyone what they want, but will give everyone what they *need*.

I'll just point out to OP that this is a really, really bad way to think about Bitcoin.
Addresses are NOT accounts and should never be spent from more than once. Wallets handle this automatically via the concept of a "change address."
@_date: 2016-08-15 04:49:24
How did you arrive at that fee? Fees need to be dynamically sent thes days.
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:20:40


If you don't know the size of the transaction, you cannot determine the "lowishness" of the fee.
I know you know this from the rest of your comment, but the text is quoted is *really* misleading.

@_date: 2016-08-17 18:07:02
How about not calling the Blockchain API for each transaction?
It's absolutely fine to use the same receive address for multiple receives, so you could use one per day, for instance.
Perhaps more simply, don't call the API until the user has confirmed that they want to use Bitcoin -- though the user-experience will suffer.
EDIT: original response was senseless.

@_date: 2016-08-19 21:45:12
It's unclear whether traffic has declined due to less need or more efficient use of transactions.
Higher fees focus everyone on efficiency, exactly as planned.
All of this is good for Bitcoin. Now we know how it -- and we -- behave, so we no longer need to guess and operate out of fear.
Finally, the rest of the infrastructure has had to learn to deal with fee calculation, delays and breakage caused by insufficient fees, etc.

The exchanges certainly report on the current value, but they don't set the price!
Those who have bitcoin and those who want bitcoin (i.e. market) are the ONLY parties who determine the price.

Unless you define blockchain as including distributed consensus, cryptographic chains pre-existed Bitcoin by a considerable time.

You can PayPal me money "instantly" the same way you can send me bitcoin "instantly" -- because neither are instantly irreversible.
Bitcoin because increasingly irreversible every 10 minutes. PayPal never becomes irreversible, and is always subject to freezing and, if reports are true, confiscation.

Accounts or addresses?

@_date: 2016-08-19 07:29:08
This isn't true, you can store data on the blockchain as you yourself stored religious text on it.
Bitcoin can only be used with valid transaction. The fee market exists to set the rate to make a transaction of a particular size.

That isn't the definition of scalability in technical terms.
Scalability typically means the ability to scale resources required sub-linearly to work required -- or using some form of sharding for linear scalability, though sharding doesn't meet the security requirements of Bitcoin so that's not an option.
Lightning allows the main chain to scale sub-linear to transaction count which is the real goal here.


Bitcoin is and always will be far more environmentally friendly than the current banking system.
Consider all costs of mining precious metals, refining them, delivering them.
Consider all costs of creating and distributing fiat worldwide, including all vending type machines that take cash.
Consider all costs of bank data centers worldwide.
Consider all costs of bank buildings in every city in the first world: HQ, tall buildings in every city, individual branch offices, ATM network, etc.
Consider all costs of bank employees driving to and from work.
Bitcoin only affects the environment with respect to electricity. This becomes a non-issue as the world is QUICKLY becoming awash in electricity due to the expansion of solar energy production created by the dual-exponential trends of higher efficiency and lower cost of production.

Bitcoin allows OpenBazaar (and others) to handle this via multi-sig:
1) Bitcoin smart contract transaction requires 2 of 3 signatures: buyer, seller, adjudicator.
2) When no dispute, buyer and seller sign, transaction complete.
3) When dispute, moderator signs with buyer or seller, transaction complete.
There's more involved under the hood, but from the user's perspective, it's just that simple.
The great thing for consumers is that the seller doesn't get paid until they satisfy the consumer, so it will encourage good vendor practices.

People have been saying this continuously since 2009.
[The average lifespan for a fiat currency is 27 years.](


Name one investment that has outperformed Bitcoin **in it's lifetime** -- not two non-overlapping and clearly cherry-picked timeframes that suits your needs.
Bitcoin has risen from $.0025 on May 22nd, 2010 to $14,149.01 as of today January 12, 2018.
That's a [return of 74,176,621.33%]( and I'm quite confident nothing has outperformed that number in that time frame.


I'm pretty confident that people will **continue to choose** sound money that they have 100% control over -- just as they have done in ever-increasing numbers since 2009.


Again, asked and answered, but one anecdote from today may suffice.
A friend tried to buy a completely legal device from a company in the Czech Republic this morning.
He tried several forms of plastic, and none worked.
They took Bitcoin, so he simply used that. It worked instantly.
If you're unable to wrap your head around the idea that having money that you control **entirely** is a benefit from fiat currency, which is 100% not under your control and can be seized, frozen, and/or confiscated by both the banking system and the government that, at best, co-operates the banking system, then you may never understand Bitcoin.


The currency that you consider "better" is better in **exactly** one very important way: it's widely accepted.
While that is admittedly **extremely important** -- it's absolutely 100% worse than Bitcoin in every other way.
In 2009 nobody took Bitcoin. In 2018, millions of people do. Again, if you cannot see what's happening -- that people are choosing a better currency -- then there's nothing I can say that will convince you.

No matter what code you write, without a hardware RNG like a BitBabbler, you will not get any random data, only pseudo-random data.
Good PRNG's such as /dev/urandom use algorithms that while not truly ransom are impossible to predict without the seed, which is not the same as random but is very useful and appropriate for many uses.

Bitcoins exist on the blockchain, both everywhere and nowhere specific.

I sort of understand their perspective, but what they universally don't understand is that nobody has ever done this before, it's brutally difficult to do this without massively screwing up, and that the reason Bitcoin hits speed bumps is because it's been around long enough and widely enough used to have hit the speed bumps.

You’re right, but do consider this:
A very tiny percentage of people own bitcoin.
A very tiny percentage of those are vendors.
Bitcoin has never been viable as a common currency for that reason alone — even when fees were ZERO.
Then there are long and weird variable length transaction confirmation times and weird, statistical transaction finality issues.
⚡️ solves all of those issues with a single blow: network latency (sub-second) final transaction confirmation time, super low transaction fees.
Combined with SegWit, it’s the end of high on chain fees — and while maintains the security of the chain.

It's also true that there's no need to rely upon a single Lightning Network channel -- it's a distributed system, so the way to achieve the **effect** of 100% ability to transact via Lightning Network isn't to trivialize the difficulty of running 100% uptime as you have and continue to do, but instead point out that there are better ways to solve the problem -- as I have and continue to do so.

You're 100 correct so long as you mean bitcoin money market rates.
Consider a hub with 100 BTC committed to 1000 channels of .1 BTC each.
The closest analogy, for me, is a checking account. Channels will work best when they behave like the tide.
You get paid, the tide is flowing in. You spend money until your next paycheck, the tide is flowing out.
In this manner, that 1 BTC channel can move a lot more than 1 BTC **through** it, and receive a tiny fee per transaction, regardless of which direction the tides flowing.
Of course, while BTC's value is rising, the ability to put BTC to work and earn additional BTC in an extremely low-risk environment is very, very attractive and will likely be so for many years to come.

@_date: 2018-01-01 07:50:43
The Bitcoin market is, like all non-trivial markets, incredibly complex.
It's important to understand that bitcoin doesn't do anything at all. It never goes up, or goes down -- even when fees are high and blocks are full. Even when the price is rising or is falling. Even during a hard or soft fork.
People are in control of bitcoin's price. Many hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, took their first steps toward Bitcoin in 2017. Many signed up for accounts, some of those connected their bank accounts. Some of those deposited money into a brokerage or exchange. Some of those bought. Few of them have ever dealt with an investment anywhere near as volatile as bitcoin. Most of them have heard years of anti-Bitcoin reporting. Very few of them know anything about Bitcoin's technology, or even it's history beyond the broadest of strokes, and what they do know was often learned through generally inaccurate reporting by people who themselves have no idea what they're talking about.
Bitcoin is a volatile (thank goodness mostly upwardly so) new kind of asset in a market with far lower liquidity than the markets they've commonly interacted with. It sways around like a small cork floating in a large ocean of the world's fiat currencies and stores of value.
A wave comes in, all boats rise, newbies buy.
Bitcoin does what it has done since the beginning.
People panic and sell, causing the price to crash.
Don't forget that a big chunk of the world takes a lot of time off during this time of year. Why would we expect bitcoin to do much?

And therein lies the opportunity! If you can imagine these issues being resolved, or better yet resolve them yourself, then it makes sense to invest in some Bitcoin.

Google is your friend.
I Googled that ID and got several hits on block explorers.


That transaction confirmed in block 501677 (2017-12-30 04:20:40 + 2 minutes) and resulted in 0.00149769 BTC being sent to address 13DBq3fnysWH3mHMrbXHHEkqShhA5LE6Vo.
Unfortunately it would appear that no change address was generated for this transaction.
The balance of 1KQqcnVtjWiri1xtM8bVWBJNuLM1geLjKV was paid in miners fee, resulting in a 5k+ satoshi/byte fee, which no-doubt got it confirmed very quickly.
Did you handcraft this transaction somehow?

I meant open more than one channel with more than one node...


Because there will be less demand for on chain transactions.


First, I think it's a RADICAL mischaracterization to suggest that opening a channel "locks up" funds -- it clearly "sets them free" by allowing instantaneous, ultra-low-fee transactions and enables micro-payments far below the purchase of a coffee.


Those two things are necessarily two sides of the same coin (pun acknowledged but not originally intended).


It's likely that on-chain fees will go down as soon as blocks are not completely full -- which will likely happen as SegWit and Lightning Network adoption grow.
It's certainly **possible** that fees will never go down due to increased use adoption of Bitcoin, but I suspect that transacting on-chain is going to become far less common as a percentage of transactions.

The thread is about committed-to-channel -vs- not-committed-to-channel.
I was responding to this sentence, in particular:


You cannot send bitcoin "to the blockchain" -- as they're **always** on the blockchain.
seems to imply there are advantages to closing channels, perhaps as a matter of security and/or hygiene.
I suspect that it will be a more common pattern to open and close them only as required to increase or decrease channel sizes as the majority of transactions will happen on ⚡️. I also suspect a fair amount of channel balancing to occur by transacting with oneself via ⚡️ which is something that is rarely, if ever, mentioned.
I stick by my repeated statement that watching a channel will essentially always be the right decision in such a case since it will be far less costly than transacting on chain because it is computationally far less costly than transacting on chain.

This is partially true, though incorrect. In reality Visa isn't finally confirmed for 90+ days in most cases, but the vendor gets their cash within 24 hours typically -- part of the value that Visa charges vendors for (which gets passed along to customers).


You see, that's the problem. It takes from **on average** 10-60 minutes for the blockchain to offer that similar feature.
⚡️ gives vendors completely finality in typically less than a second -- the time of network transit of the protocol packets -- with zero cost to the vendor.
⚡️ gives customers incredibly low fees.
⚡️ gives the Bitcoin network the ability to scale to a single common global transaction network from the largest to the smallest transaction sizes with far better security and transactional characteristics than the traditional financial system.
All without affecting core protocol security in any way.

They would demand higher quality investments that pay higher returns for the additional risk they take by not holding bitcoin.
Those investments would have an additional advantage of being able to HODL currency without taking inflation risk.
Germany faced this issue after the Weimar hyperinflation. Their economy grew a ton because the hard currency demanded great value creation in order to justify the high price of German exports.
They created high a quality, efficient production methods to drive cost down. This included early robotics adoption — which made Germany a leader in industrial robot exports.

The hash rate is NOT proportional to the transaction count, it’s proportional to the amount of security required to secure the blockchain — which appears to inextricably bound together with the price.
Lightning Network is designed to offload the vast majority of transaction volume from the chain, which will allow the bandwidth required to run a node remain affordable yet at the same time allowing transaction value to skyrocket and transaction fees to plummet.
As for environment issues, it is abundantly clear that solar panels will soon be the cheapest form of electricity, effectively eliminating any and all relationship between energy use and environmental damage.

Nobody wants to limit transaction capacity per se, they simply want to ensure decentralization.
As for SegWit adoption, I don’t believe that’s a protest vote, it’s simply inertia and general bit rot.
The announcement won’t come out of nowhere. It’ll be communicated clearly, years in advance and anything divisive will be left out since widespread support will be so important.

It’s incredibly valuable to store data in such a hardened fashion.
 It’s perhaps the answer to the question “what’s the intrinsic value of Bitcoin?” — the ability to record data, unforgeably timestamped within a ten minute window, that it can never be altered, with cryptographic certainty.
If that capability were exclusively reserved for bitcoin transactions of the distributed ledger variety, then the value of bitcoin transaction capacity would be extremely pure.
As it is, that space is competed for by ledger entries AND data storage, which makes it less pure.
Good bugs believe jewelry and industrial usage underpins the value of gold. I think they’re a noose around its neck!
I believe Money/currency should be a measuring stick for value transfer, underpinned only by scarcity and verifiable accuracy.
An ideal money/currency to would not change value as fashion and/or industrial demand for stable electrical conductivity oscillate around their mean.

Fiat currencies, despite the illusion that they’re perfectly stable, and the FACT that they are currently more stable than Bitcoin, also fluctuate quite wildly.
See GBP immediately following the Brexit vote, for instance.

This was long enough ago that solar energy and electric cars posed zero credible threat to oil, so it really made me consider how to manage scarce assets.

I agree with you that EVERYTHING is a currency unto itself and everything else is simple FX, but most of the world doesn’t appear to agree with us.
The concept of currency is generally bestowed upon the “most useful” commodity which also generally means the most liquid commodity.
In the case of barter, each “currency” is valued for what it is.
In the case of a transaction using a non-commodity currency, the value of the currency has nothing to do with the currency itself, but rather the liquidity it offers into something else.
It appears to me we don’t disagree much, just in trivial semantic differences that could likely be hammered out over a couple of beers. ��‍♂️
My original point is that the distributed ledger, all by itself, is tremendously useful &amp; valuable and there would be an advantage if simply being a ledger was the only function it provided in that all demand for it would be uniform.
One of the biggest problems with gold as a currency, beyond its horrible physical limitations, is that should demand for gold sharply change from non-monetary use, it’s value as a currency would be orthogonally altered.
I suspect the value of bitcoin itself, and bitcoin block space in particular, could be similarly orthogonally affected by the secondary function of ultra-durable storage.

You seem to believe that each full bitcoin has an identity that follows it for life. That is entirely incorrect.

Wallets track your funds over series of typically single-use addresses.
If you watch carefully, you'll notice that your receiving addresses changes every time you receive a transaction.
So, your wallet has multiple transactions, but a single address contains only a single transaction.
It may also be possible that the transaction fee was too low and was rejected by the network. In that case, the senders' bitcoin should remain available in the sending wallet.

@_date: 2017-12-14 09:47:33
Nothing starts at 100%.
Every transaction that opens a channel begins reducing pressure on the chain.
Should many channels open quickly, pressure on the chain is reduced quickly.
It's possible, though exceedingly unlikely, that chain pressure would increase more quickly than chain pressure is reduced. In that case, the rise in fees would moderate the appetite to open new channels -- while simultaneously increasing the benefits of opening channels to those who really need them the most: those who make many transactions.

The entire financial system today is built as a system of intermediaries, each of which take their cut of nearly every transaction that they facilitate.
Bitcoin very nearly eliminates every one of those, and will probably destroy the leaders of the intermediaries who remain necessary as they’ll mostly likely to avoid the new reality until they’re replaced by more nimble upstarts.
So, I think it’s reasonable to consider the elimination of intermediary fees as the revenue stream for Bitcoin — which itself has zero expenses as all operating costs are borne by its users.
And then there’s the very real cost of inflation which it also eliminates.
I believe that people value Bitcoin because they can see the value that it can return back to the end users of the financial system.

One thing to understand, however, is that each node has its own mempool, and there is no universal mempool to speak of.

Blocks will be made large to support on-chain transactions as improvements are made to make it safe to do so.
Perhaps Lightning Network will work -- I certainly think it will -- but perhaps it won't.
Either way, avoiding centralizing the chain is the number one priority for the vast majority of the community according to node counts, and that's what counts. We can thank UASF and SegWit2x for finally putting this issue to rest.
So, what you **think** might happen is irrelevant. Things are happening, and those things will cause other things to happen. Most likely, nobody will be 100% right.

5. Checks aren't used much any more, plastic transactions take months, but cash is final. On chain Bitcoin is not really cash until several confirmations.
Yes, long live Lightning Network, I'm a big believer and it will resolve all major issues that Bitcoin faces on the road to becoming a commonly utilized currency.

They’re not equal.
Bitcoin is growing in popularity. It’s supply becomes extremely stable, very nearly fixed, in 3 halvings.
Any time after that point, should Bitcoin become the world reserve currency, it would be reasonable to assume goods priced in bitcoin to lower in price at about 4% rate, the long term growth rate of the world’s economy — 4% larger pie, split into “the same” number of pieces, should result in 4% price deflation.
The rate of change of the inflation rate IS NOT comparable to the inflation rate itself.
I only intended to discuss the supply inflation rate of both, [which is comparable today]( and will very likely be forever lower after the next halving.
Hope that clarifies things.

There's also a market for something that would make much of the world attractive and intelligent, but that doesn't mean such a thing exists and/or is practical.
Once you get a true mental model for Lightning Network you'll understand that:
  1) Lightning Network transactions are on-chain transactions.
  2) Lightning Network channels don't tie up your bitcoin, they set them free.
  3) On-chain transactions are significantly inferior (too long and non-deterministic confirmation times) for most transactions.

If it replaced 100% of gold's value and 100% of fiats' value worldwide, it would be $5.8M USD (today's value) per bitcoin, assuming there are around 4M bitcoin lost.
Being such a liquid currency, so easily stored, transacted, and secured, and so incredibly hard (inelastic supply) may pull value away from other stores of value such as real estate, stocks and bonds -- so the value could actually be higher than that.

Because banks are well known technological innovators?


Which, by most objective measures, is massively overextended if not quite bankrupt yet, and has had continuously declining financial health since the late 60’s yet still maintains a massive empire, is actively fighting several foreign wars, and cannot balance its budget even during financial boom times.

Your “logic” doesn’t add up for me.
All you’re saying is that the future will look just like the past. In my lifetime, that’s been a sucker’s bet...
The reason bitcoin’s performance makes you uneasy is because there’s never been anything like it. It’s the first store of value that eliminates financial intermediaries, can also serve as a currency and unit of account as it matures, is apolitical, censorship resistant, is not counterfeitable, is transactable at a distance, is cheap to store securely, is programmable, and has a non-elastic supply.
In addition to those intrinsic values, it is also an incontrovertible timestamping snd proof-of-existence system and the only financial system designed for the internet era and as such is by far the most secure and reliable financial system ever built.

Are you speaking about the step-change December 24 at 10:05ish?
If so, it confused me too but I think I figured it out -- and it explains both of your questions.
Those weird vertical actions are the result of evictions and inflows as the mempool crosses the capacity limit in both directions.
The one I mentioned above is an inflow caused by the substantial drop in the size of the mempool that preceded it.
If you look at the two week chart, you can see the opposite reaction on December 18. That's the result of newer, higher-fee transactions building at the top, continuously evicting lower fee transactions until about December 22 at 7:30ish.
Not sure why there was such a sharp change upward on the 24th. It could be code related, peer related, peer-connectivity related, or simply a HUGE influx of new transactions across the entire price spectrum.
Working through this gives you glimpse at the challenges Core faces, and why more technical people understand that the concept of a singular "mempool" is horribly flawed.
A node's mempool is its alone. Depending on the settings at launch time, and the peers it's connected to, each mempool is a very special snowflake at any given moment...

1. No, you’d tie up $100 in the channel and split the fee with the other side.
2. You close the channel and open another, or send yourself funds via ⚡️ from another channel.
3. Time will tell. If they do that, I suspect people will switch channel partners pretty fluidly.
4. ⚡️ doesn’t define the term “super node” but I doubt more people will run ⚡️ nodes than run full nodes today.
5. Why not just leave it in the channel for other purchases? Most transactions will be on ⚡️ as few people will want to wait and pay the fee for onchain transactions for small amounts.
Overall it’s important to understand that zap never removes funds from your control. Your coin are always on-chain, just temporarily held in smart-contract WITH your channel partner.

While this has always been a good idea, it doesn't really resolve this issue as each transfer to an address is an independent UTXO and will increase the size of your transaction, raising the cost.

[“Banks create money by issuing a loan to a borrower”](
As for a Bitcoin’s value being tied to USD, tell that to people who pay and accept BTC for goods and services, who buy and sell non-USD currencies (including what you describe as non-currencies) world wide.
The only difference between a currency, a store of value, a unit of account, and a commodity are differences between various items, who buys them, the purpose they’re used for, and the number of people who accept them.
There’s never been a single item that could be used for all four purposes.
Granted, bitcoin has challenges in some of all of those categories, but I can see the solutions coming online and believe Bitcoin is in a very good position — in fact the best position of any cryptocurrency and the best position it’s ever been in.
The only thing weirder than Bitcoin moving toward being a world-wide universal currency, store of value, and unit of account — which would make it the most useful and valuable commodity of all time — is getting as far as it’s alteady has.

I'm having a hard time believing you know enough to ask this question but not have a fairly good idea of what the responses would entail.


That's like, your opinion, man.


I have zero problem with Bitcoin's usability at the moment -- which is not to say that I'm unaware that the current situation is non-optimal in some respects. In particular, I really wish that some of the heavy transaction creators who opposed consensus on the block size issue would implement SegWit and/or transaction batching which would radically improve the present situation.


I'm confident that there's consensus for block size increases in the future.


Yes it is, which is why it's so vitally important that this be done correctly.


Nobody ever suggested it should.


That's known as a straw man argument and is pointing the finger in the wrong direction as well.
If you really want to improve the situation, pressure commercial entities such as Coinbase to implement SegWit.

You can say Bitcoin isn't money all you want, but it simply isn't true.
In fact, the very concept of money as a special thing is a pretty silly concept. The only thing that's special about it is that it needs to be the most useful commodity.
Bitcoin is more useful than traditional assets because you can do more with it. And it's apolitical, so no need to trust in the goodwill of government to maintain it.

3 independent groups have been working toward a common specification and interoperable implementations of ⚡️.
They have recently achieved 3 way interoperability on the main net. They're building the future they want, and the technical people I communicate with prefer to other scaling alternatives.

Bitcoin isn’t a Ponzi scheme for many reasons. I’ll let you use Wikipedia to educate yourself on why.
Bitcoin is a new, world-wide, non-government issued, non-government controlled, apolitical monetary system.
Which is to say it’s a brand new thing.
It’s a risky investment, but is currently growing quickly — not unlike Apple, Google, Facebook, etc. in their early days.
Saying it’s not money because it’s not accepted everywhere means that no money is money, including gold, because no money is accepted everywhere!
It’s hard to use your imagination to see that Bitcoin is well on its way to being the world’s most accepted money, but I recommend you try.
The only thing harder to imagine is Bitcoin having gotten this far.
P.S. Old timers have heard your arguments since 2010. All of them have been wrong to date. This doesn’t mean you’re wrong, but should make you stop and think you may be.

I use it to store wealth.


Prove it. Only a very, very tiny portion of the population wants Bitcoin today, only a tiny portion of those people are vendors, so only a VERY VERY TINY portion of vendors take Bitcoin.


I don't believe I've ever seen anyone shamed here for transacting bitcoin.
If you think people telling others to "HODL" (which you didn't say, but I'm attempting to understand your shaming comment) that's about selling bitcoin during price downtrends, not about using it as a currency.


Gold hasn't been used for common transactions for hundreds of years, yet it's remained a relevant store of value.
The problem with using it today is that block space is highly constrained. I believe it to be constrained for very good reason, but your mileage may vary.
So, in your example, to buy a game for $50 you'd likely need to spend between $55-60 worth of bitcoin to get the $50 game -- not economically wise!
Lightning Network (⚡️) is coming and will make bitcoin a truly useful currency, something **it never has been** due to variable length confirmation times for various levels of transaction finality.

If it’s $10k on an exchange, you can sell it for $10k regardless of what you paid for it, earning a $9,999 short-term capital gain.
You may gain a bit less due to various transaction fees, both on-exchange and on-chain, depending on how you manage your BTC.
I personally recommend buying and HODLing for a very long time, 1 year minimum, to kick yourself into long-term capital gain territory, which is taxed at around 1/2 the rate of short-term capital gains which are taxed as regular income.
Ideally, you’ll HODL your bitcoin until you don’t have to sell them for fiat currency, and can instead trade them directly for goods and services you want and need...

I think it's more reasonable to think of it being locked on-chain, and unlocked on ⚡️


I think it's far more likely that we'll open channels with those we transact with frequently.


I think it's reasonable to think of them in that way.


On ⚡️ the funds themselves are always on chain. ⚡️ transactions are ready-to-broadcast Bitcoin Network transaction smart-contracts that cryptographically guarantee the ability to settle on-chain at your convenience.


I don't understand this, and I believe it's based on the flawed assumption of your previous question.


A hub that is going to forward transactions needs enough funds to guarantee liquidity for the channels that may close in the future. Think of it this way: you guarantee a friend you'll pay them what you owe them by putting $5 on a table where they can see it. You then tell your friend that you'll pay them $1.00001 out of the $5 if they give $1 to the person sitting next to them.
You've now sent $1 through the first friend to the person sitting next to them and the first friend was paid for providing the conduit.
Nobody needs to trust anyone due to cryptographic guarantees provided by the Bitcoin Network smart contracts.
Many, many, many transactions can take place per transaction recorded on the blockchain.
This is the essence of multi-tier scalability and why ⚡️ can be technically described as a write-cache layer for the blockchain.


They'd just need to have a channel open with someone you have a channel open with, though that relationship can extend several hops -- like the 7 degrees of Kevin Bacon...


I'm not sure how you jumped to channel closing, and I'm pretty sure the answer is no.


I don't believe it is...


There is no externally-induced uncertainly in the ⚡️ protocol.
I recommend you carefully consider why you see ⚡️ as locking your funds up rather than setting them free.
Think of the chain as your savings account. You keep the majority (hopefully) of your cash where it's ULTRA secure, but is a bit slow to transact on, as it takes time to unlock, open, close, and relock that ENORMOUS safe that it's held in. It's also quite expensive to distribute transactions to thousands of nodes all around the planet where they're audited and stored for safe keeping.
Think of ⚡️ as your checking account. You "transfer" or "lock up" funds from savings into a smart contract (on chain) allowing ⚡️ to transact it instantly, nearly for free, and with no trust required as all funds are guaranteed by on-chain contracts.
It's important to understand that Bitcoin is an information processing system. It's doesn't move funds about in the traditional sense, it's all about maintaining a quality record of the transactions.
While it's convenient to describe bitcoin as "moving", "being held by" and "locked up" those terms are meant to describe what's happening as similes to the physical world and are not necessarily indicative of what's actually happening on the information system.

The way I've always understood it was that the block reward was to bootstrap the process, and the reduction was to weaning miners off the reward in a slow, long-time-horizon manner.
It frustrates the hell out of me when people say the network will collapse when the halving happens.
It *could* happen. But consider this: the mining reward 6 months ago had approximately the same value as a 12.5 BTC reward at the current price.
It also frustrates me to no end when people think that a reduction in the hash rate is the network signaling an imminent failure. It's *entirely* possible that the miners, collectively, over-build the hash rate.

Bitcoin ownership is defined by control.
Control is defined by sole possession of private keys.
Unless you're the only one who has ever know the private key, you don't own them because you don't have exclusive control of them.
The only safe way to transfer ownership of bitcoin is via the blockchain -- from their current owner to an address or addresses that you solely own and control.
There are many ways of securing private keys with passwords. But, whoever set the password had access to the unsecured private key and would have access during the password change procedure you described.

Damning evidence about myself?
I'm a big believer in science, factual evidence and observation. What in the world have I said that indicates I want to exit civilization and the comforts and benefits it surely provides?
What I did say is I want out of the rigged fiat currency system nearly every person lucky enough to live in an advanced economy operates within today, and I surely don't wish to propagate that system to those who, while unfortunate by our standards, live without it today.
That's not a contradiction: I recognize and appreciate the benefits that banking has provide advanced economies. At the same time it's obvious that we've reached their limits and the time has come to move past the current system and its historical baggage:
I'm not sure why you believe your experience working within the system gives you more authority on the subject, regulatory capture suggests otherwise.
Rather than working within systems, my life experience is in tearing down old systems and replacing them with more efficient systems. I've never once met a person who was part of the old system for more than a very short period of time who was willing and anxious to pitch in and help with the demolition.
Creative destruction drives the world forward, not a delicate and nuanced understanding of the existing system! Einstein didn't give a damn that relativity made Newtonian mechanics -- as revolutionary as it was in its time -- look childish by comparison. Of course, many eminent physicists at the time non-creatively destroyed their careers by denouncing Einstein.
I'm not a believer in the bad-to-the-bone bankers working to enslave the populace to serve the invisible hand of an invisible Illuminati. It's simpler than that: they're the product of a too-close-for-comfort relationship with the political class, both of which are experiencing their Uber moment (though neither seem to see it yet) as technology in general -- and Bitcoin specifically -- pulls the rug out from under their centuries old position of power and authority.
Nothing is certain about the future except for the fact that it is difficult to predict -- unless your prediction is that it won't look like the past.
I personally suspect the world political/economic system will undergo a radical shift which will have incredibly far reaching implications because it is one of the foundations civilization is built upon.
I'm more than willing to be wrong about that prediction but something has simply got to give. The current system is far too exclusive, far too expensive, and far too old fashioned to maintain the equilibrium.
What I'm completely and entirely unwilling to predict, however, is how, when, and why this will happen, exactly what it looks like on the other side, and what the consequences will be. I suspect we're going to have to all a long way through hell before we get to heaven, so to speak.

That said, I believe all discussion along the lines of "what's good/bad for Chinese miners" i.e. they're often believed to be less well connected than many other places, has zero merit and should not be considered.
They have inexpensive land, buildings, employees and electricity. Other places have great connectivity, better financial infrastructure, more technical workforce, etc.

Haha, there basically were no modern paved roads when cars were created. You're the guy saying "cars were designed to be run on dirt roads, these freeways are wrong!"


Everything is worth what you can get for it. If you believes formulas define value, you have a great deal to learn.


But there is hoarding. Huge amounts of it! Why? Because Bitcoin is the best currency yet, and more people every day realize it's wise to trade some of their fiat for Bitcoin.
Suggesting it wasn't designed to be hoarded ignore its fundamental qualities. If Satoshi wanted us to spend it more freely, he should have made it crapier than he did.
People spent Dogecoin like crazy. We all know how that worked out.


It works the way it does, the way it does changes continuously, and predicting the future is damn near impossible.

That is not a reasonable way to measure value of BTC.
While your fair value overlays nicely with actual price, I think you've reversed cause and effect.
Until quite recently wallet software nearly universally assigned a fixed transaction fee of 0.0001 as you mentioned. The USD value of that fee fluctuates exactly with the BTC price. Using your fair value, twice the price would always generate twice the fees.
Recently, as the transaction rate approached the in-built transaction rate limit, wallets have begun adjusting fees to the emerging fee market, which might make future fee data more indicative of network value.
Your method would appear to suggest you should be able to value USD by dividing all the USD in existence by all of the fees paid to move it around. With USD that would clearly be impossible, but I don't believe for second that you would suggest the amount of income Brinks, Western Union, MoneyGram, Visa, MasterCard ad nauseum would have an arithmetic relationship to the value of USD!
I'm a bit shocked that you didn't discuss miner rewards which should certainly be included in network fees when valuing the network, and circulation inflation which affects scarcity.
Next there's the problem of fees -vs- value transfered which you touched on. The idea that "the network" operates in a fixed fashion is understandable given that many explanations were written when there was a uniform software implementation -- Bitcoin Core. While this aids in understanding, Bitcoin is far more complex today.
Large miners and mining pools no longer use the default rule set to choose transaction order, so the idea that large transactions get priority is no longer a truism. It's surely true that transferring a lot of value is more valuable than transferring a small value, yet your "analysis" doesn't take that into account.
At the end of the day Bitcoin, like all currencies, will be priced based upon it's utility -- much of which may -- like gold -- exist as a store of value. Bitcoin has more predictable scarcity, is cheaper to store securely, is more transactable, is easier to "transport", is harder to counterfeit, and is nearly as durable as gold.

The flip-side of this -- 21inc facilitates individual mining as they've stated as their intention -- would be equally good for Bitcoin.
It's conceivable that mining could become unprofitable for large centralized miners while still increasing the hashrate.
That is the best possible outcome.
So you have two sides of the same coin, and it comes down to their intent.

It helps to prime the economy's pump, and you can avoid the loss of future gain by using services that buy each time you send.
I don't believe that pumping the economy is important, though.
If everyone held on tight, the value would rise faster, which would make more people want to get in. One of the easiest ways for a merchant to get in is to sell product for Bitcoin.
Since the economy is small at this point, converting to dollars is pretty silly unless you're marketing Bitcoin holding shoppers.
If you're a general merchant with an ongoing business in fiat currency, accepting Bitcoin for your product is unlikely to lower your fiat cash flow by more than a tiny amount.
Should Bitcoin sales suddenly take off, then you can convert what you need in fiat and avoid exchange risk.
As a merchant, signing up for Coinbase or BitPay and converting to USD for each purchase is an absolutely silly thing to do, IMHO.
The *best* way to get merchants onboard is to make Bitcoin *desirable* to own. Then merchants will *want* Bitcoin and at that point, of course they'll be willing to trade their wares for it.

Because they are very, very clear that their number one priority is protecting the decentralized and, therefore, censorship resistance of the Bitcoin network.
They don't want to maintain the current level of decentralization, they want to increase it, and they believe the risks to the network posed by small blocks are less than the risks posed by large blocks.

I believe they mean that it's unlikely that a completely distributed and trust free transaction processing network could be bootstrapped without an underlying token.
For instance, Visa might be able to create such a system (if it knew how to build one that could scale to their size) by paying mining rewards in native currencies, but I don't believe said mining network would be as distributed and permissionless as the Bitcoin blockchain.
I, and most early adopters, wouldn't trust it unless it was released as open source, for peer-review reasons.
If they did such a thing, their competitors would pile into Bitcoin in response, since it already has a scale advantage and they're tired of being in Visa's rearview mirror.
And finally, the fees would need to be higher, all other things being equal, because both the miners and Visa need to be fed.

Let's make sure we're on the same page. :-)
Practically speaking, all transactions require a fee. If you're willing to wait a LONG time, some wallets will allow zero-fee transactions.
Modern wallets will calculate the fee for you based upon transaction size (bytes) and market conditions. Using breadwallet since they added fee estimation has lowered my fees considerably. So use a good, modern wallet that does fee estimation!
It's important to be clear: "transaction size" is an overloaded concept. People less experienced in Bitcoin are more likely to equate it to "the amount of bitcoin transfered" whereas more technical and/or more experienced in Bitcoin are likely to equate it to "size in bytes."
A transaction's size in bytes may be difficult to predict, again a good wallet is your friend.

I don't agree with this.
It's time to give it some runway.
One of the worst aspects of doing nothing is loss of confidence in the Bitcoin system's ability to make reasonable decisions.
One of the things that I find most irritating is over-stating the cost in the present of increasing the block size. If such concerns were valid, blocks would be full already. The system shows each and every day that it *can* and *will* run below the maximum block size.
Given that, so long as the block size increases at the same rate or even more slowly than the cost of storage and compute grows, the wheels should stay comfortably on the bus. :-)

It's OK, if a bit shallow. Perhaps the biggest mistakes I saw were:
1) He suggests the having will have a completely predictable outcome. His stated outcome is entire based on the price of Bitcoin not increasing between when it was recorded and the halving. We now know it's already increased, and we now know more efficient miners are coming online...
2) His point about mistaken usefulness of internet in the mid 90's doesn't ring true: a) I don't believe many people felt the internet's use case was video delivery; instead email and web browsing was far more likely. Finally, his "photos of cats" was about YouTube's videos of cats, and I believe Netflix is now responsible for far more bandwidth than photos of cats.
Point 2 is nitpicky, but if he's claiming to be an authority he should have his facts straight.

No it does not. It is likely to result in lower cost -- particularly given the paltry transaction volume on the BCH chain -- but the speed of transactions is identical on both systems.
Transactions are confirmed every ten minutes. Unless there is a backlog AND you don't pay a high enough fee, BTC and BCH transact at precisely the same speed.

Everyone who holds Bitcoin, or nearly anything else, has the chance of it going to zero -- that's why holders tell newbies not to invest more than they can afford to lose.
Zero-conf transactions have always been, and likely always will be, just that: unconfirmed transactions. Nothing done recently, including opt-in replace by fee, changes that.
As the distinguished Mr. Szabo -- who is not a core developer -- said recently, the differentiator for Bitcoin is decentralization and censorship resistance. The core developers agree.
Note that by being resistant and delaying the blocksize increase which nearly everyone agrees needs to be implemented (but disagree on implementation) the appearance of segregated witness now greatly informs the decision to be made.
If you previously felt that x sized blocks were the way forward, then you should now agree that x/2 or x/3 is now the way forward.
This is an example of consensus in action: if the decision had been made earlier, the wrong decision may have been made. Decisions should always be delayed until the latest responsible moment, as more information is available later.
I started the debate on the big block side of the fence. Delaying the decision has proven to be correct: we now have a more mature fee market which allows empirical discussion on the key concerns, we now have wallets that calculate fees rather than have fixed fee amounts, we now have segregated witness telling us that smaller blocks will go further than previously believed.
And all of that happened without the system freezing up, collapsing, etc.
Everyone calm down. The answer lies somewhere in between...

There is no reason, but they do, and I don't need to trust them, nor do I, but I certainly don't trust them less because they're Chinese.
Nor do I believe that this is indicative of centralization. China is a big place and The people there are just like the people here.
When Bitcoin was started mining was far more centralized in the US -- which likely means BTC ownership is still centralized there.
Nobody had a problem until it was concentrated in China.
And, since they're pools, there's not even proof that the bashing is centralized there...

T/A has been shown time and time again to not improve outcomes.
It's possible that T/A worked at one time. But an absolute truth of markets is that once more than a few actors know something works, it immediately stops working.
Read any T/A analysis. They all sound precisely like palm readers. "I see this in the future, but the exact opposite is also possible."
Finally, it's been shown time and time again that the human brain is a pattern matching machine. It's so sensitive that it tends to find patterns in absolute randomness.

 It's inflation of amount in circulation, not inflation of total units.
Not sure inflation is the correct word -- not sure the right word exists -- am confident that impact is not predictable from past behavior.

No, I neither said that, nor insinuated that -- what you think I said is a reflection of your own thinking, not mine.
What I pointed out is that adding **if** doesn't make any question you ask pertinent.
Nobody can guess the future. You can **chose** any strategy that makes sense to you.
History has shown quite clearly that for many people, buying, HODLing, and accumulating on dips is an extremely effective strategy.
Every time the price falls and people sell, and then the price goes back up again, there is a stream of posting here saying "I should have held!"
If you think you can time the market, that's fine, I hope you outperform the algorithms you're trading against -- though my confidence is, essentially, zero that you will.

Please stop spreading this FUD.
If what you're implying is true, nobody would ever take a check, debit or credit card.
Checks clear faster and more certainly (3 days) than credit cards (6 months) and neither ever becomes truly irreversible in that the bank and "authorities" can do all sorts of nasty things; just ask Kim Dotcom(sp?)
Folks who believe as you do need to learn some accounting and spend time in the real world. People have been operating since the beginning of time in an environment where trust is less than 100% and managed to survive and prosper.
BTC greatly lowers the exposure to fraud. Ancient business practices will manage the rest just fine, leaving more profit in the vendors and/or honest consumers' hands and both will continue to foot the tiny percentage of fraudulent transactions as they always have and likely always will.

I'm a 49 y/o serial entrepreneur and software developer.
I began programming in 1979 and wrote video games for the Apple II in high school.
Next I founded a desktop publishing/digital printing and prepress service bureau.
I helped build high-scale backends in the late 90s in the SMS industry when you couldn't text inter-carrier.
I consulted for Fortune 50 companies teaching software-change-management and automated deployment during the Sarbanes-Oxley transition.
I'm a founder and sit on the board of [Engine Yard]( the earliest and largest independent PaaS provider in 2006, on the potential we saw in the Ruby and Rails technology and community.
I'm a founder of [Subledger]( the first double-entry accounting API for software developers -- the off-chain, low-latency ledger that makes accountants jump for joy. :-)
I'm involved with Bitcoin because it's clear the current monetary regime, however well intended, is fundamentally corrupt.
Worse(!), its exclusionary and permission-based security model is radically slowing all progress toward automation that would radically reduce expenses and allow every person on planet to participate equally in the world's economy.
Bitcoin is not a small thing. The reason so many people are violently against it is that it scares the hell out of the (in my experience) 80-90% of the population who are fundamentally afraid of change.
Money hasn't changed in a long time. It's about the only thing that hasn't. It's the corner-stone of complacency, the one thing that reliably hasn't shifted under their feet.
Bitcoin is a tectonic shift under everything. It's scary as hell, and that's where the violent reactions come from.

I agree with your position 100%.
At first I was entirely on Gavin's side of this, though I could never understand where 20MB came from.
I assumed that he had proposed a BIP, and haf failed to reach consensus with the opposition simply saying "no" and not offering a compromise.
As soon as I heard that he had caused all this ruckus *without* filing a BIP, my position changed quickly, though so still favor an increase.
A hard fork without filing a BIP is just another altcoin, IMHO.
At least one Redditor on another thread suggested what Gavin was doing was OK because BIP is a mess. I cannot say whether it is or not, but until it's been publically demonstrated as detrimental and/or incapable of steering future direction, BIP should be followed.

Bitcoin is not infallible. It's credibility is rising, however, while fiat's credibility is falling.

Not worth $.03 for overwhelming proof that something existed at a particularly moment in time?
Satoshi chose to use the genesis block in that very same way!
An extremely common method of doing this is to mail yourself something. The post office's mark is considered to be solid evidence of date of origin -- and a postage stamp currently costs about 15x as much as a bitcoin transaction. The postal method is also a bit of a poor man's solution: if you want better proof, you hire a notary public which costs about $30 -- a whopping 1000x more than a Bitcoin transaction!
Do you find such use of the blockchain somehow abhorrent? Like it's such a pristine thing that nobody should lower themselves by placing a checksum into the blockchain?
A Bitcoin transaction costs about $.03. That is PRECISELY what it's worth.
We're not disagreeing about the fact that checksums are lower quality than a good cryptographic hash, are we?

No, it just means that if blocks are full (as determined by miners, individually), not every transaction CAN fit in the next block, therefore no fee can guarantee that any given transaction WILL get in the block.
As with much of Bitcoin, it is statistical. Statistics apply to data, but not datum.

Yes, the best way to expose a flaw in the system, is to narrowly follow the process, shine public light on it, and demand that the other side follow the process as well.
Imagine how much more support Gavin and Mike would have if they had publically announced they had filed a BIP application, and began pressuring the BIP system itself.
He might have:
  1) fixed BIP itself
  2) come to consensus
If that didn't happen, there would be very clearly documented reasons to force the form.
As it is, there's simply a ton of he-said/she-said, including in this very thread, some of the high is mine.
There's a process. Follow it. If it's broken or corrupt, fix it or expose it. If the expose is the best you can do, feel free to fork.
EDIT: what you're doing here is conflating the block size debate, already a mess, with your issues with the BIP system. Even if your arguments are 100% correct, they're far less powerful due to said conflation.

People's unwillingness to part with it is predicted by Gresham's Law.

This phenomena has been observed before -- but never at a time when most money was so bad -- and never when the new money was so much better.

This is a terrific example of protecting your ego. It's not something people do consciously, but with practice you can learn to gain control of everyone's worst enemy: their ego.
It CLEARLY DID NOT make more sense, given 20/20 hindsight, yet rather than reflect on the mistake you made, and many others made, and had I been involved as early as you may have made as well, you STILL maintain that it was a good decision at the time.
In fact, it was a terrible decision at the time!
That's Ok, nobody bats 1,000. Steve Jobs once said that if he were right half the time the board would be delighted with his performance!
Yet here you are wondering if a diety is punishing you. Why? Because it's easier on your ego to believe that than to fess up to having made a poor decision.
The most valuable lesson you could learn from this is to never be 100% certain of your decision quality.

Correction: they don't want bitcoin enough to entertain those -- yet.


Disagree: the rising price is what will drive merchants' desire enough to entertain taking it.


From everything I've read, the percentage of transactions that are in Bitcoin are low enough that -- if a merchant wants bitcoin -- there's zero difficulty accepting Bitcoin and HODLing them.
Businesses generally make 5-15% profit net of everything. Bitcoin transaction count are rarely even 1% of total transactions, so unless there's a severe mix problem, accepting Bitcoin is simply the cheapest way for a merchant to accumulate Bitcoin.

No, the price does not suck.
It sucks from your perspective.
To anyone who bought at $1, the price does not suck.
To anyone wishing to accumulate more bitcoin, which includes millions of people who are in this for the long term, the price is FANTASTIC.
If you were a true investor, you'd be less interested in high prices, more appreciative of the ability to accumulate more bitcoin with the same amount of fiat, and **far** more interested in the health of the network and ecosystem.
Instead you're a disgruntled trader who probably knew nothing about the technology, ecosystem, and apparently the market when you bought in due to FOMO during the run up.
Just relax, wait for the next run up -- could be a while -- I **hope** it's a while -- and then make the biggest mistake of your life by selling what you have as soon as you can get your precious fiat currency back out of the best currency to have ever existed.
You'll hate bitcoin even more as it makes you look like a complete fool after that. ����

$22M per bitcoin would require massive inflation of the USD.
At present value of USD, Bitcoin would get to $3-5M only if, essentially all fiat currencies and precious metals were replaced by bitcoin as a medium of exchange, store or value, and unit of account.

I apologize for being unclear.
Insurance is built on actuarial data. Given certain measurable parameters, statistics are applied to determine how to price insurance against a given event.
The insurance company doesn't give a hoot about why a loss occurred, so long as it fits the parameters. The insurance contract is written and so that, given a tight set of observable metrics, they know in advance what their loss ratio will be.
The folks selling insurance at Lloyd's in Londo. (betting on whether ships would return from sea) realized that they didn't need to know why the ships didn't come home -- all they needed to know (to create one of the largest industries On the planet), was how many ships left for a destination, and how many returned.
Hopefully that clarifies why the title of this thread is completely wrong. If it were right, it would also be true that:
  1) you'd never be able to insure a person's life, because THEY DIE ALL THE TIME.
  2) you'd never be able to insure a car, because THEY GET DESTROYED IN ACCIDENTS ALL THE TIME.
  3) you'd never be able to insure a house, because FIRES, FLOODS, TORNADOS, EARTHQUAKES and HURRICANES DESTROY THEM ALL THE TIME.
Hope that helps!

It used two addresses because the amount you wanted to send wasn't available in a single address.
HD wallets (and some others as well) use a different receive address each time you receive funds, and always spend the entire amount in an address (with the change being sent to a new address in the wallet as well).
This avoids address re-use which improves privacy and security and is a good thing.
@_date: 2015-12-18 02:36:33
Unless you hold your own private keys, neither the addresses nor the coins are yours: they're Coinbase's and Coinbase promises to do as you ask.
It's a subtle but important difference to understand.
The biggest differentiator of Bitcoin is it allows you to have complete control of your cash and, therefore immunize yourself from censorship of your transactions and outright seizure.
It also immunizes you from custodial risk, at the cost of raising your risk of outright theft should your security measures be inadequate to protect your private keys from theft.
Coinbase is like the traditional banking system so the benefits are swapped: you trust that their security measures are at least as good as yours and you trust them to allow you to send and receive transactions via the addresses they assign to you.
Their vault project with multi-sig is somewhere in between.

No, I mean 50 years of deflationary pressure in the tech space.
Every bit of technology costs fewer dollars than it has in the past -- even given years of inflationary monetary policy, yet technology has still proliferated.
Given massive deflationary pressure, and Keynesian economic theory, nobody should ever buy any technology because it's "obvious" they should simply wait.
P.S. The only time gold may ever have been a deflationary asset may have been when a shipload of it sank in unrecoverable places. Gold is inflationary, just less so than fiat currencies -- just as Bitcoin supply is inflationary -- and likely will be for decades to come.

Chinese miners have had a cost advantage for a long time. Perhaps they need to spend more to handle 8MB blocks, or begin mining in countries with better connectivity.

Thank you for the clarification.
For here, I'd define failure as:
  1) Never having a formal number assigned, which I've heard occasionally happens.
  2) The core developer group not being able to reach consensus on a reasonable course forward
  3) The core developer group not producing code and/or not accepting code to implement a consensus.
It seems self-evident that should a BIP be formally discussed in public, and PR merged, to implement either BIP-100 or this new proposal, and one of those merged into core, we will very likely avoid the vast majority of peril involved in a few developers self-declaring Bitcoin XT as the "new Bitcoin."
I'd feel most comfortable with a gentle increase (2x or 4x) and regular increases (3 or 4 months) intended to increase at around half of projected bandwidth increases. This would avoid substantial shocks and give us more frequent samples to judge the effects of the increase by.

1) Bitcoin distribution is highly skewed to original adopters/miners.
2) Those folks are now wealthy, having seen incredible net worth increases.
3) Some cash out, some diversify, all spend some of their substantial net worth to acquire physically desirable items like houses, cars, clothes, furniture, computers, essentially every creature comfort they desire.
4) The amount converted rises as prices rise over the years.
5) Many of these comforts come with ongoing expenses: insurance, maintenance, property taxes, etc. These newly comfortable folks now have a monkey on their back, requiring a higher income, placing more pressure on the market.
6) Many of these folks invest substantial amounts back into Bitcoin startups, etc. These startups demonstrate the adage "it takes money to make money" and this repeats step 5.
7) Falling prices directly affect the number of coins that must be sold to finance the new expenses. Rising prices have the opposite effect.
8) There is an upside: these expense flows flatten out BTC distribution. I'd be highly surprised (always happy to wrong) if distribution was not improving steadily.

The three top people in the company all echoed identical "Bitcoin gone in 5 years" messaging during the relaunch of the company to remove the bit-stain from their name.
That *is* the ethos of the company.
They'll take the money while its there but will not waste their time building on something they're convinced is going to fail.
And to convince the old money they're not insane they'll take every opportunity they can to shout from the rooftops that they're not believers in Bitcoin's future.

I believe that network effect will cause Bitcoin to become super-dominant as adoption begins in earnest.
I believe this is true for the same reasons that there is only one internet.
The world already has a tangle of currencies, just as it used to have a tangle of data transmission networks.

This is the crux of adoption headwind for truly innovative technology: people who don't understand the technological shift underneath always compare them to existing things they understand.
The people who do understand them know that the underlying capabilities will allow things not yet imaginable, but rarely can convince naysayers that these unknowables will outweigh the naysayer's fear of change.
As technology grows more and more quickly, it's increasingly advantageous to be an early adopter.

The only tax implication is the price difference between what he bought it for and what he trades it for.

Your response is the legal truth, and I applaud your well reasoned response.
As NewEgg has demonstrated, businesses that value their customers will frequently respond to such incidents more favorably than they are legally required to do so.
As a serial entrepreneur I see it this way: as soon as you need to consider legal obligations, you'd be better off apologizing to the customer, asking them what will make them happy, doing it if it's reasonable and is how you 'd like to be treated.

This argument about price inflation -vs- monetary inflation is so old.
The number in circulation is inflating, but the entire supply, fixed at 21 million, is not.
This is why people with a long term view argue that it IS NOT inflationary, while those with a short term view argue that it IS inflationary.
The non-inflationary group base that argument to gold, which has long been considered non-inflationary even though a lot of gold is mined every year.
Why is it non-inflationary? Because everyone knows there are a fixed number of gold atoms on the planet, that they're becoming harder to get at, and that we're still a long way from asteroid mining.
Bitcoin is, I believe, the first non-inflationary currency where the exact final quantity and the rate of creation are largely known in advance.

That's not the way I see it at all.
Everyone will always know PRECISELY what percentage of the currency they own.
Given that the wealth of the world has been increasing steadily (other than a few blips along the way) it seems likely that Bitcoin tips the table in the opposite direction, i.e. BTC's value should rise over time unless it gets supplanted by another currency.
Moore's Law and side chains makes me hopeful that won't happen for a long time.

Hey Ben. Thanks for reaching out to the community on this.
Question: 200.8 (B) seems onerous given 200.9.
Why would your department concern itself with what investments, and what currency those investments are denominated (USD) in, a company is allowed to invest it's profit and retained earnings in, given the fact that the company is required to be bonded to protect customer assets?
These crypto-currency companies may profit in crypto-currency. Eliminating their ability to invest their profits as they choose, and not in crypto-currency denominated investments would severely limit their freedom of action in the developing crypto-economy.
Additionally, this would appear to put crypto-bank business (think Coinbase and Circle) at a structural disadvantage to traditional banks, which are allowed to invest in stocks ( and, no doubt, many other things. :-(

I never suggested that limiting supply creates stability, I said limiting supply meant your currency value couldn't be inflated away.

While an increase in value -vs- native currency is volatility, no merchant has a problem with upside risk!
I suggest to merchants that they accept bitcoin and hold them or spend them natively.
A merchant with a healthy business can accept bitcoin as a means of acquiring bitcoin without concerning themselves with exchanges.
It's not like a huge portion of their business is likely to switch quickly, and if it does, they can simply choose to limit the amount of risk they are willing to take.
One nice thing about accepting Bitcoin for payment is that it's NOT LEGAL TENDER, so you're never forced to take it...

Accounting was designed to track what you have and how you use it.
If you have bitcoin, it should be accounted for as bitcoin.
A fundamental rule of accounting is that a set of accounts must use a single unit of account. If you're holding USD, EUR, BTC and gold, you should have four sets of accounts.
These sets can then be reported upon independently, or combined via conversion rates  to represent your combined position in any unit of account at the moment the conversion rates were chosen.

You would NOT need to change the data stored in the DB if it were in decimal format. I suspect MySQL allows for a flexible decimal position, I know Pg does.

I'd hazard a guess that its transaction value is high compared to its capitalization is due to it's ferocious inflation rate.
When currencies are hyper-inflating, the velocity always increases dramatically. Consider the transaction volume -vs- market cap of Bitcoin the day the 10,000 BTC pizza was purchased, and then consider what the rate of inflation was when that happened.

I have no blind faith, the closest I have is a belief that unregulated markets are surprisingly resilient.

So, price up 3x+, hash rate up 248x.

I see the hash rate stabilizing around current price point.
Given that I'm bullish on both BTC and engineering ingenuity, I see increases in the future.
Super unclear why anyone would see this as an indication that decreases will accelerate if price holds.
It's not impossible to imagine a 10-30% decease if price floats down over the next few months. But that would hardly signal trouble to Bitcoin's future, though it could be hard on marginal miners.
I'll be first to admit I'm wrong given contrary data in the future! :-)
If I were a miner, a bit of consolidation time to take a deep breath, streamline operations, line up capital partners, and sleep a little would be highly appreciated before the next sprint begins.

Yes, this is possible.
Someone posted here a while back that he was handing out paper wallets as tips, which is a low tech implementation of your system.
The problem is that it'll take the same transaction fee to transfer it to the new account, though since you'd be doing that in advance, you could use a zero-fee transaction.
Double-spending would be prevented by the receiver immediately transferring it from the transfered account to a new or existing one that they alone control.

If this is your argument, why do you prefer bits to satoshis?
A satoshi is 0.01 "bits" after all, so the fraction is still there AND your "smallest bit of information" rationalization collapses as well, as satoshis are, currently, the smallest amount of BTC...
Using what is, perhaps, the best established word in information tech, which coincidentally has previously been used to describe an eighth of a whole unit of ancient currency (pieces of eight), is IMNSHO, a very short-sighted idea.
I always felt "millie" and "mike" for .001 and .000001 were cute, friendly, marketable, unambiguous, and nicely connected to technical reality.

The number of coins in circulation is growing by a fixed number of coins per block.
While the number halves every four years, the block reward increases the number of coins in circulation by a lower percentage every block.
Given that everyone involved knows the circulation plan, the final count, and how quickly the rate declines over the next 6-8 years, I doubt it's having much impact on price.
I think it's also incorrect to call it inflation, though that's splitting a pretty fine hair. :-)

No offense intended: I absolutely loathe articles like this.
For Bitcoin to be successful, or mainstream, it has to become more useful to more people.
There simply cannot be any substantial argument on this subject.
I observed the Internet evolve since the late 80's.
I don't remember anyone sitting around discussing how to make it successful, but I'm certain that happened. And I'm also certain that nobody successfully convinced people listening to alter their ways.
The market caused great things to happen. All of it worked, together, some net positive, some break-even, some net negative, to achieve the present day penetration.
So it will be for Bitcoin. The platform is in place, the market is acting, improvements are coming much more quickly. After all, we didn't have the present-day Internet and tooling to innovate atop as we do today!

Bitcoin must be used as a unit of account if you're dealing in bitcoin as a good.
If returns are a problem due to its volatility, then policy should reflect that accordingly.
To say it won't be used as a unit of account anytime soon is entirely incorrect. How can I be sure? Because I have customers doing exactly that, and I'm confident that each and every exchange has some method of accounting for bitcoin, i.e. uses it as a unit of account.

Most of the distros are highly secure by default.

You make statements as fact, but they're simply not true.
  1) They have the 3% fee and no chargeback as reason to adopt now.
  2) It's undeniably hip, awareness is growing, stories on magazines and TV, etc. Many want to be hip, and many want to shop at hip places, so the business owners want to be perceived as hip.
  3) Bitpay, Coinbase, et al entirely eliminate this issue, and I suspect you know that.
Finally: The best business people are proactive and prefer to play offense. You suggest they're *universally* reactive and defensive when you state "A business only has incentive to adopt if they are losing business to other businesses that have adopted bitcoin."
And, let's be clear, Bitcoin is *already* a game changer. But I do agree that it will be obvious to everyone, even the naysayers, when it goes from billions to trillions.
In any case, it's gone from ZERO to billions. Next stop tens of billions, then hundreds of billions, then trillions.
And, of course, it could go from wherever it is to zero at any point along the way. Though I think it's safe to say that outcome becomes less likely as time moves on...
@_date: 2014-09-26 19:54:58
The risk analysis is simple: invest money I can afford to lose for a fixed portion of what could, possibly, become extraordinarily valuable. Risk and reward are always related. BTC is extremely risky, and therefore inevitably, *potentially* extremely rewarding!
I've heard the "promising technology is shit because of x , y, z" naysayers many times. They're often, in fact usually, correct. Th best example of them being wrong, in lifetime, were the internet and the iPhone.
I invest in things that allow new things to happen. That is why I own BTC.
It could go to zero, it could go to the moon. NOBODY knows what will happen, anyone who says they know, for certain, has a huge ego problem.
Either way I'm 100% OK because I learn something new every day, rather than obsess about what I already "know", which I understand could go the way of ether, the flat Earth, and the Earth as the center of the universe.

 This may seem old skool, but you could build the tech, raising funds if need be, and ask people to pay for the service itself in any currency you choose.
What currency you capitalize in, and what currency you accept as payment, probably should be orthogonal to the tech.

A couple of things to consider:
  1) There are circumstances where no transaction fees are required, and transactions will process quickly (

No company can prepare all employees to answer all possible questions, particularly odd-ball questions like this one. Why does OP care what fees Circle pays in processing fees? I get curiosity, just saying it's not a question any company would expect to be asked.
I applaud the rep for saying he/she don't know. Given that the rep didn't know, the only improvement possible would be to limit his discussion bout industry standards and what not.
The rep also could have run the actual answer down, but even that may be impossible because it is likely volume based and, since nobody knows the future, it's possible they could not put a single number on it.
Finally, it's also possible that getting the product out the door is more important than having a precisely tuned business model.
They raised a ton of cash which allows them to move quickly and take a lot of risk. After they measure the performance of the business, they can always tune their model by adjusting spreads, hedging, and a variety of other means.

Malleability is technical debt. Current product developers have worked around segwit, but all future developers will have to deal with it to!


Malleability. If you've ever written code, imagine other people being able to change the ID of your entities. Handling that is technical debt in every Bitcoin codebase!


Hardly. It's an improvement that paves the way for additional improvements.


Because it threatens decentralization which is fundamental and critical.


Because the way the crypto works you cannot. If they were possible it would have been done long ago, in less political times.


Yes. I doubt that gold has more physical settlement transactions than Bitcoin could handle.
Physical gold has far more transactional fiction, far higher transactions costs, confirmation times, and security concerns including outright counterfeiting than current BTC does.
It's used by very few people worldwide, and has far higher economic consequence than Bitcoin does today.

No, it's not. In fact, it's a common market dynamic and business practice to regulate capacity.
If you're at capacity you raise your fees until capacity drops to the point where you make less profit.
Some purchases are required to find other solutions until you've increased capacity, demand has dropped, or the need is great enough to justify the cost, or the person increases their income and is willing to part with that income.

It's part of a solution. Script versioning opens the door to Schnorr signatures.
And, of course, you can fit more transactions into a SegWit block than a current block.
And SegWit eliminates malleability, which is a HUGE BUG that makes EVERYTHING built on Bitcoin more complex than it needs to be, open a huge range of potential downstream bugs.
Fixing malleability also makes Lightning Network much easier to implement, and massively increases transaction capacity.
I hear you about transaction capacity being impacts *if* SegWit takes a long time to activate. But that time could come MUCH MORE QUICKLY if folks like you hopped on board.

It'll be less secure, centralized and have a "managed" money supply.
In the 90's many people felt open source software could never work. Who would maintain it? Why would developers write it for free? How could you trust it?
It was generally assumed it'd be lower quality than closed source software. The opposite is true: everyone maintains it, including the closed-source vendors it threatened. Developers wrote it because they loved it and cared. And today essentially every computer runs open-source software, and Linux runs more computers than any other OS combined.

SegWit is all about making Bitcoin on chain scaling as inexpensive as possible now and in the future.
It increases transaction capacity, and paves the way for inexpensive layer 2 networks.
Add in the fact that should Bitcoin become too centralized, it will become worthless, and you can see why extreme caution is required.
This is all quite tricky. Better to err on the side of caution, particularly when the doomsday folks have been consistently wrong and the core folks have been consistently right.
Filling the blocks is the best thing ever for Bitcoin's maturity. Wallets, miners and nodes have had to adapt to a condition which WILL HAPPEN in the future. Better to work out the issue early than later.

Consider that bitcoins are becoming more and more valuable.
The price must double every 4 years for status quo.
And then there're are the transaction fees...
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:25:08
As many as you can get.
Taking Bitcoin is rare, and doing so provides liquidity to those who have it. Providing liquidity is a valuable service in and of itself.
Bitcoin's value fluctuates against other currencies -- as do all currencies against each other -- but Bitcoin is more volatile than most. So taking it also assumes volatility risk -- upward and downward.
The point being that selling your voice for Bitcoin allows you to set your own rate in Bitcoin, or any other currency! So if taking Bitcoin is interesting, but is going to take you time, energy, and risk to do so, ask for a higher rate to cover yourself.

t2 instances are not designed to be used under continuous load.
They operate against CPU credit. Once you've used your credit allotment (which is increased hourly but never beyond a certain amount) then they shift down to a lower minimum speed mode.
I'd recommend syncing with a c4.large then booting the EBS snapshot onto a t2 once syncing is done.
Larger t2 instances have more credit and higher minimum throughout and may also work.

While not suggesting that Bitcoin is either a good or bad investment decision in this case, your advice is definitely contrarian to even the most conservative investment advisors.
When beginning investing, they say, you invest early in riskier investments. The capital at risk is trivial, and the compounding potential is greatest, so the extra reward of riskier investments pays the greatest dividend.
As time marches on, you lower your overall risk so your capital will be there when you need it. But you should always have some amount in high risk investments becsuse their reward is higher.

You've got to make your own decision, of course, but I doubt too many people here will disagree that it's worth the risk to invest 5-10% in BTC.
But do spread the purchase out over a time to avoid panic selling when volatility arises. Understand it's a long term investment and be happy when the price goes down because that means you'll end up with more BTC so long as you continue to accumulate when the price is weak.

Banks don't trust each other, which is why they've always put intermediates between themselves.
They also don't trust their employees.
Private blockchains are, then, shared ledgers between untrusted parties, partially relying on the same old and failed security model that has served banks and other large corporations poorly as of late: security through obscurity.

It probably should have been lower.
The reason it's magical is because it's in the majority of software participating in Bitcoin consensus. That is a bit magical, in the same way every other rule is -- which is far different than saying it is perfect.


I don't believe for a second that it'll stay that way forever. Seems most developers I know agree it should be increased some time after segwit becomes consensus.
Block size limit provides a wedge to get segwit into consensus which, as we're seeing, is not easy!
Malleability sucks and needs to be fixed. Segwit fixes it, makes transactions more efficient and opens the door for future, hopefully less devisive, improvements.
When you're out of space in your current home, it makes sense to clean house, get rid of some stuff you no longer need, make some improvements, and generally tighten down the screws before you make the move into a bigger house...
No difference here. In any other open source software projects segwit would get done immediately. But that's the *beauty* of Bitcoin -- no central authority.

Not sure why you believe that, the proposal clearly states that profits may only be invested in USD denominated investments, all investment grade and relatively low-yield, mostly government bonds.

What does "manipulated" even mean?
If you mean that being willing to pay more makes the price go up, and being willing to pay less makes it go down, then I understand.
If you mean that some market participants buy and sell in cycles with the purpose of altering the price, then I don't see how that's different than above.

The problem with being a bully is that unless you're the biggest, most bad-ass bully in the world, a bigger bully eventually bullies you.

The truth is that business, which is simply one best measured portions of the entire market, has very few clear definitions of what an individual business should and/or must do, other than survive, as you've alluded to.
One clear business trend which appears to be related to information tech, is variable pricing.
Supermarkets are using centrally updated electronic price displays and updating prices as often as they feel the need. Airlines are *entirely* as-quoted at any given time. Electricity rates rise and fall with the usage, as do all commodities, as do all prices in a free market.
McDonalds is highly likely to adjust the cost of fries based on the price of gas, and the huge number of other variables that determine their cost, as IT makes it easier for them to do so.
Why? Because competitors will do so in an effort to be more competitive, and their shareholders will demand increasingly predictable financial performance.

This is a terrific answer and I'll add a few points.
This is a subject I've been thinking about intensely since 2007.
  1) Statistical evidence is clear: the VAST majority of security issues stem from employees hacking their employers, not from external hacking. It's quite clear: you have more to fear from your own employees than you do from someone at Amazon, or a third party hacker.
  2) It's equally clear that Amazon knows security and is quite serious about their reputation. They've thought about this issue, and have more to lose from a breach, than anyone else.
  3) It's trivial to say "someone notices a server" but these types of datacenters are: a) huge, b) generic (every server is identical), c) dynamic (virtual machines are swapped between physical servers to balance load, replace hardware, update software), d) strictly process controlled.
  4) It's easy to configure encrypted filesystems on Linux, so even if they have a disk with your data on it, they have nothing. If you're storing sensitive data on your servers, and not using this, it's your fault, not Amazon's.
  5) It's HIGHLY LIKELY that Amazon datacenter employees have ZERO information about who/what is on a given server. To do so would be a huge security issue and we'd likely have seen information leaked from inside Amazon if this were not the case ( applies to Amazon too, and  says they're fully aware of it!)
Believe me, unless your a secure datacenter operations expert, you're almost certainly more secure atop Amazon than in your own datacenter.

Mining centralization will be reduced in many ways, the most important of which will be protocol changes that reduce and/or eliminate the advantages of centralized mining (such as IBLT) and, eventually, competition from deep-pocketed technology (Google, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft) and financial companies (Visa, MasterCard, big banks). Eventually, however, the cost will be driven down to zero profit by millions of business running their own nodes (once ASICs reach an efficiency plateau) and/or many devices (anything that plugs into a power socket) have a 21inc (or equivalent) mining chip built in and operating at a small loss or no-better-than-break-even.
Development may be a bit centralized, but there are a lot of developers working on Bitcoin already. It's open source, so should anything nefarious come about, it'll be easy to opt-out.
We've seen before that pools are NOT centralization threats. When the pool behaves badly, it can be dismantled quickly by independent miners switching their has power elsewhere.

@_date: 2017-02-14 18:07:21
Agreed. Also true that the count appears to be slowly diminishing over time, so it's critical, at a minimum, to stabilize it at a safe level.
Ideally it would be headed higher before increasing blocksize, but SegWit is necessary and only a brave few are willing to consider reducing legacy block size to balance SegWit's increase which will, at activation, increase node operation costs and, perhaps, increase centralization pressure in the short term.

The only reason it's profitable is because the market has yet to agree on the true price of Bitcoin.
Difficulty adjustment + halving were intended to make mining a break-even venture.
In my opinion, the only reason mining is profitable today is because the current group of miners are ahead of the curve compared to big capital.
Once international corporations and, eventually, governments drop the hammer the current group of miners will be squashed like bugs on a windshield.

It's not the same. Neither that Satoshi's are currently the minimum representable unit, nor the fact that they're stored as integers, is relevant here.
You're suggesting that 10 and 1 are equivalent if 10 must be written without a decimal, and 1 can have one decimal place, i.e. 1.0!
A Satoshi is NOT the minimum amount of Bitcoin possible, it's EXACTLY 1/100,000,000 BTC.
You and I can exchange smaller amounts off-chain, for instance, and settle up larger amounts on-chain.
And if BTC does what we hope it will do, the system will adapt to allow smaller amounts on-chain, and that will NOT increase the BTC supply at all.
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:35:37
Assuming the wallets we're using different keys, your example is irrelevant.
Transactions are priced by size in bytes, not value transferred, so the cost of a transaction is dependent on the number of inputs required to cover the number of outputs sent to.
So fees depend on transactions received in the past as well as current fee rates.
Finally, the word ripoff connotes an act designed to enrich one entity at the expense of another. Unless Jaxx wallet is cutting the authors in on the transaction, it is not a ripoff.

No, he's saying that if the cost to run a miner and a block explorer were to rise to 20x current, that would cause a great deal of centralization, which would be bad.
I agree.
What he's also saying is that if we don't increase block size, the cost to run for hose will plummet, assuming historical price/performance trends remain intact.
how much lower would you like it to be?
Has anyone projected cost of mining -vs- time, given block-size growth and computation price/performance?
If not, I'd love some help doing it. Who's in? PM me.
I'd like to find a dynamic schedule that slowly increases block size while slowly lowering the cost mining. That'd be two birds with one stone!!!

The security of the system is dependent upon the number of people using it.
The value of the system is similarly dependent on the the number of people using it.
It's a double network effect, tightly related, as the higher the value of the system, the higher the need to secure it.
Miners are "automatically" incentivized to provide security roughly equal to the value of the network.
The only way to counteract that virtuous cycle would be to discover a security system that provides enough benefit to outweigh the astronomical security advantage Bitcoin currently enjoys.
Bitcoin -vs- altcoins is a popularity contest of sorts, but it'll require a lot more than fashion to supplant it.

1) The opportunity to understand how the network, wallets, and users operate near/at capacity and how a fee market develops is worth learning so we can discuss future strategy via logical conjecture based upon observable evidence rather than crystal balls and navel gazing.

Bitcoin wallets manage multiple addresses, typically following the HD wallet standard.

Similarly, each time you receive from the wallet, a new address controlled by the wallet is created for that receive.

Bitcoin will become be accepted by vendors until they begin to realize they want to HODL it themselves.
It won't function as a common urrency until it's widely held and desired enough to remain stable.
No matter how hard you try, few will use BTC as a common currency while it's price continues to rise as it's economic suicide to do so.
It's early, and there's no doubt that the deflationary forces are at work -- but that's OK because we're very early in a very long game.

We've been taught that deflation is bad, small inflation is good, and high inflation is bad.

2) bad for borrowers. This is true, but I see it as a useful disincentive that is much needed in a world awash in debt.

There are several measures of "size" the not least interesting of which include total transaction flow and price.
Bitcoin could continue to grow in those dimensions even while total transaction count stops growing.
A great way to avoid the scenario of limited transaction count and/or total people involved is to support SegWit which fixes bugs, makes Bitcoin more efficient and easier to develop against, and increases the transaction limit.
@_date: 2017-02-16 21:47:47

@_date: 2017-02-24 20:51:24


Something that hasn't moved cannot be returned.
There is no "in between" state where a transaction is "in transit." with the possible exception that begins when a transaction receives its first confirmation and ends when enough confirmations (additional blocks appended to the chain that includes the block your transaction was included in) have been received to satisfy the parties to the transactions' concerns that a chain report could occur to reverse the transaction--though in that case its highly likely the transaction will again enter the reorganized chain.
All appearances and experiences to the contrary are the result of UI decisions made by wallet developers and/or user ignorance.
@_date: 2016-03-08 02:50:25
Saying it isn't proven adds nothing to the conversation.
NOTHING that needs implementation that isn't up and running can ever be proven, so all you're saying is the the future is impossible to predict.
And that's every bit as true for an immediate block size increase as it is for LN.
P.S. The only problems last week were people using out of date or poorly implemented wallets and blaming bad wallet behavior on the Bitcoin network -- like blaming a Internet Explorer rending bug on TCP/IP.
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:49:09
The cost of hashing is entirely unrelated to the number of transactions.
If transaction rate was 1000x current, hashing power could be higher or lower.
There's very little margin cost per transaction -- a bit of crypto computation and storage equal to size of transaction.

I don't believe this to be true.
The difference is that a DoS attack's value is directly related to effectiveness of the attack: the better it works, the higher the value for the attacker.
A blockchain "attack's" value has a component of value *inversely related* to the effectiveness of the attack: the better it works, the higher the value for the attacker *but the higher the cost of the attack due to increased fees*.
If the blockchain attacker is not sitting on a hoard of Bitcoin they're willing to part with, the attack would raise the price of Bitcoin due to the need to acquire Bitcoin.
If the blockchain attacker *is* sitting on a hoard of Bitcoin they're willing to part with, *the attack would lower the cost of Bitcoin* which is pretty interesting. :-)
Damn, I wonder if the attacks are a tactic associated with shorting BTC?
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:39:35
I suppose it depends upon the definition of "in production", I took that to mean "activated."
So in your view Core can be accused of shipping SegWit and hard fork late, but what about the miners?
* We will run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core.
* We will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production, for the foreseeable future.

Nothing about Bitcoin is plain and simple.
But, in fact, SegWit makes Bitcoin more simple in a couple of ways, while making it more difficult in a couple of ways.
As far as software goes, I'd consider SegWit a bug fix + optimization + refactor, not even worth a major version update, which—given that the version didn't bump to 0.14—it appears Core agrees.
Who put out the "it's too complex talking points?"
And why didn't they raise the concerns when core decided to write their own crypto library? THAT'S complex, and the core team is so good that, in doing so, found bugs in OpenSSL!
Bitcoin Core is really good, you should give them more credit.

Not in terms of computers and smart phones. Economists say deflation causes people to delay purchases. Everything with a microprocessor in it has been deflationary yet people continue to purchase them in every larger numbers.
After all, one thing that everyone can agree on is that reducing prices increases demand, and computers and smartphone prices have been plummeting since their creation.
You simply cannot have it both ways.




I'll give you the fact that if it could be done mathematically, it makes sense. But price-inflation cannot be measured accurately, and is always a political subject. Furthermore, "prices" is way too vague a term to define.

Many critical variables adjust over time. In many ways, having precise, monotonic "monetary policy" is a key concept of bitcoin.
Why not let block size float similarly to difficulty?
  • tiny(!), but frequent(!), increases or decreases(!)
  • .01% increase of average of last 24 blocks
As transaction counts increase, we'd all like to see a smooth transition in mining capacity. Why not build in some fees by keeping space in blocks scarce, yet increase as system volume increases?
@_date: 2017-03-05 00:51:24


No, this isn't correct. A currency is inflationary when its supply is increasing, and deflationary when its supply is decreasing.
12.5 BTC are being added to the supply in circulation approximately every 10 minutes. From that perspective it may seem to be inflationary.
With a 21M cap, you could argue that the supply isn't really increasing, though that's a bit of stretch IMHO.
At some point, coin lossage will reduce the amount in circulation more quickly than mining increases it. At that point BTC will be deflationary.
But none of that indicates that BTC is deflationary due to the exponential decay mining algorithm, and certainly not today.

I won't speak for but I think he may be pointing out that mining has always been designed to trend toward zero profit.
It's important that it remain decentralized. As such it needs to be a community service provided by individual users in a decentralized fashion.
This has always been obvious to me. Only ASICs and their process improvement had allowed a temporary trend toward centralization and profitability.

You're not wrong, but you've missed his point.
They're developing an alternate version of Bitcoin with different consensus rules.
There are many ways to do so.
The mature way is to make as few changes as possible to the current version of the software to achieve your desired alterations and do so in a way that allows you to merge in the good and non-controversial improvements that core is making -- and vice-versa!
Or, you can do it in a way that BU has chosen to do it: as developers who are not experienced enough to know the right way to do it would...
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:52:22
Sorry, but I literally don't have enough time to do a complete rundown.
Simple answer: SegWit is the proposal created by the group of developers who've developed Bitcoin to this point, BU is a fork created by a splinter group of developers.
Controversial opinion: IMHO SegWit is more widely supported by the technically adept, BU is more widely supported by the technically incompetent.

I think it's better I say "there was more demand to buy Bitcoin than supply for sale."
It's not the number of people, it's the quantities!
Another common answer is "more people were buying than selling" and it's just as wrong: buyers and sellers are always perfectly matched.

@_date: 2017-03-31 15:21:25
You can use cryptographic hash functions to "hide" data be saving the hash of the original data instead of the data itself. This is typically how passwords are "stored" in databases. When the password is submitted in the future, it's hashed again and compared to stored hash. This way nobody with access to the data, routine or otherwise, had access to the passwords since the hashes cannot be reversed into the password they represent.
Puzzle friendliness is why hashes are used in Bitcoin. It's hard to find the right hash for a block, but easy to verify.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:59:34

Unfortunately I cannot answer they question as I don't know the answer.
What I can say is that there is no standard, uniform handling or measurement for this sort of thing.
Miners get to whatever they want with transactions.
In a similar fashion, there is no uniform concept or view of "the memool" as each miner maintains their own mempool as they see fit.
This is true despite the fact that Bitcoin Core may have default settings. There are command line switches to change many behaviors built-in, and miners can run alternate systems and/or modify the code themselves to meet their own needs.

The good thing about the way Bitcoin works is that when some people gain a massive chunk of Bitcoin, it actually creates scarcity.

If you believe that, you're not qualified to take a stance on Bitcoin.
Trust free and immutable timestamping never existed and has enormous value.
Trust free, permissionless value transfer never existed and has enormous value.
Security at the level of Bitcoin never existed and has enormous value. Only Bitcoin currently provides that level of security required by the first two intrinsic values of Bitcoin.

There is no such thing as transaction SPAM.
If the transactor is willing to pay the fee, it's NOT spam.
Which, by the way, is why large blocks are a bad idea: they allow "spammers" to cause pain to node operators less expensively than is now possible.
Blockchain space is *precious* as it allows innovative new financial transactions to be performed in a trust-free and un-censorable manner -- something that has never been possible!
The downside is that it's "expensive" to operate at scale as every node has to store every transaction. If it becomes too expensive to run a node, centralization occurs. If it becomes too centralized, it becomes censorable.
"Spamming" Bitcoin will always happen when the cost goes to zero. See photos encoded into the blockchain in the past for examples of wastefulness when fees are too low.

You're missing his point which leads me to believe you're not an engineer.
What he's describing is how a highly skilled group of developers *would* proceed to alter the code to achieve the same functionality and behavior as the BU team desires.
The skill of Core is FAR higher than BU. It's entirely evident by many of the choices and actions that they've taken so far.
The skill different is not subtle. It's the difference between Core Seal Team Six and BU cops and robbers with plastic guns and holsters.

Fiat is worthless. That’s a basic flaw in the system and it’s been plaguing the people of Venezuela for years.
With countries calling for cash free models, fiat will soon share the “what if the power goes out?” question.
For Bitcoin the answer is simple enough: when the power goes out, grab your OpenDimes, which can be cryptographically verified by anyone running a node before the power went out, and use your wealth to move to where the power is still on.

Not all money received is income.
Simplest example is an escrow company.
The buyer sends money to the escrow company -- that money is not income, it's a liability.
When escrow closes and money is disbursed -- that money is not an expense, it simply reduces the escrow company's liability.
The income the escrow company must report are the fees they charge for their service.
So, if you run a lightning network node for free, you have no income to report.

Now we're talking.
I'll admit that *neither of us* can prove anything about this. I believe it's blatantly obvious that trained economists cannot prove their ideas either. I support that by the extremely poor economic control current economists have had of our economy in our lifetime.
To support my idea, I have what I believe to be a completely relevant example of electronics as disproving the textbook reason given that "deflation is bad." If that were true, as prices have dropped faster and faster for these items, people should have slowed their purchases because "it will be cheaper tomorrow." Clearly the opposite affect happened. The lower the prices, the more were sold. This, to me, is a sound counter-example to the economic theory we've been taught.

No, I understand the pie of value is not fixed, I'm not a zero sum game thinker at all.
The problem is in the money -vs- value relationship.
I firmly believe that money should be fixed supply so nobody can engineer a situation where the value pie is increasing and, due to inflation, people think they're prospering as their wages increase but in reality they're being impoverished as the money pie grows faster than the value pie.

I would expect that as process improvements level out, miners will slowly cede their centralization as more competitive nodes come online, and miners realize that they cannot continue to invest at a rate that will allow them to maintain their lead.
There would be little need to take their equipment offline until mining reward is unprofitable, which would only happen when the highly distributed hash rate is equal to or greater than the centralized hash rate.
If Bitcoin's hash rate was cut by substantially overnight, aside from the slow-block issue (which critical but can be consider separately) it wouldn't make Bitcoin insecure, it would simply reset the security back to whatever point in time Bitcoin had that total hash rate.
It wouldn't be a good signal, and I'm sure it would spook the crap out of the market, but I don't believe it would create a death-spiral in-and-of-itself.

At some point around 2044 I suspect bitcoin to become deflationary due to burned and lost coins.
That year more than 99.9% of all Bitcoin will have been mined. Mistakes will be made and Bitcoin will be forever lost through key loss and transaction construction errors.
I suspect the deflation rate to be very, very low, but could be substantial at times should catastrophes occur on gigantic wallets.

There's a rare situation known as a chain reorganization that can occur for several reasons that can cause mined blocks to be "rolled back"
The certainty of permanence increases exponentially with confirmation count (block depth), which is why 6 blocks are considered the minimum if you want to avoid any chance of weirdness.
The good news is that every block added adds a confirmation, so you'll most likely get additional confirmations approximately every 10 minutes.

You almost have it right.
1. Addresses don’t spend, transactions do.
2. Transactions may have one or more inputs, and one or more outputs.
3. Each input and output is known as a UTXO.
4. Each input is an existing UTXO, each output creates a new UTXO.
4. A UTXO may only be spent once, in its entirety.
5. If a transaction doesn’t spend (including transaction fee) the entire amount of its input UTXOs the change is, indeed, sent to a new address, known as a change address, in the wallet.
I don’t believe UTXOs are uniquely identifiable if two UTXOs exist for the same address for the same amount. I may be wrong about this, and would welcome and appreciate a correction if I am incorrect.

How many contribution to the Core code base do the BU folks have?

A small group of developers who decide to go-it-alone are far more credible if they've been major contributors to the existing project.

Fascinating that you believe you know that.

But sure, believe what you will.


I long for no such thing. You’re the one who brought up the doomsday scenario.
I believe there are some problems, but generally believe they were caused by market forces (banks provided extremely value services) and regulatory capture (which I’ve witnessed first hand).
Bitcoin is part of the current reality. I don’t believe it’s a panacea for the world’s problems, but I do believe it will demolish the current financial system.
Just as Netflix demolished Blockbuster, et al, and Amazon demolished Sears, et al.
I see the problems with Netflix, Amazon, etc.
Are they “good?” In many ways yes, in many ways no.
Do I wish I bought their stock “back then?” No, because I did, and still hold them, along with others, some of which went to zero.
So, what I believe is this: Bitcoin is disruptive and will become highly valuable. So far, so good!
I also believe it’ll be disruptive and may cause a lot of pain, as Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, etc. are causing today.
And I also believe it doesn’t matter what you or I think. You place your bets and take your chances, and I’ll do the same.

BU is orders of magnitude "more complex" than SegWit due to EC.
Not the code, but the behavior.
SegWit is more efficient, fixes malleability (a gigantic issue in and of itself) and provides a terrific base to further optimize and provide new functionality.
I can respect the folks who'd like a simple block size increase, they know not what they don't know.
But BU is a really, really, really bad choice for many reasons.

Apparently not all, because the time stamps are out of order sometimes.


Given that a new block must be built upon an old block and is uniquely chained to that block, how can it be timestamped BEFORE the block it's built upon unless the clocks are skewed?
I must be missing something. It appears to me that particular consensus rule was designed to allow for fairly massive clock time skew between individual systems.

There are two reasons the house price would increase:
  1) the supply/demand equation has changed
  2) the value of the currency has decreased
\ is a “true” increase in value. Congratulations on choosing the right neighborhood, or improving the appeal of your home!
\ isn’t an increase in value at all, only *in fiat terms*. Due to targeted inflationary policy, the amount of currency you need for identical purchasing power increases.
At 2% inflation per year, the price will increase by 1.02^5 = 1.1040808032 or about 10.4%. But don’t think you’re getting wealthy, because something that cost $100 when you bought the house will cost $110.40 after five years.
The most insidious thing about inflation, in my opinion, is that it creates an environment where you **think** your income is increasing (because you get pay raises) while negating your raise via debasing the currency.
In the worst of cases, you can have a situation where you think they’re getting ahead while you’re actually falling behind. This happens when inflation outpaces wage increases.
Since inflation has multiple meanings, originally an increase in the money supply (monetary inflation) and more recently a general increase in prices (price inflation) and the modern definition is impossible to measure precisely and is constantly being redefined (some would say improved, others would say manipulated) it is very difficult to understand which way is up.
A fixed monetary supply makes things much simpler! Now prices of assets reflect the portion of global wealth that asset currently demands. As the world’s wealth increases, the fixed monetary supply demands that prices of assets fall.
Imagine how easy it becomes to measure your wealth now, and in the future, in this system. One of the variables has been removed from the equation entirely, and worldwide the system has been reduced by hundreds of variables — the continuously changing currency value fluctuations are removed entirely.
Want to understand the wages of someone in a far away country you know little about and  nothing about their local currency? It’s currently tricky. With Bitcoin it’s very easy, particularly if both individuals operate with Bitcoin — where it becomes directly comparable.

BIP 75 does not change the blockchain, or any of its mechanisms, in any way.
It's an *optional* protocol that provides a standardized mechanism for securely communicating purchaser information (but not necessarily identity) such as shipping address, phone number, refund address (should one be required later) along with payments as well as vendor information so that wallets can categorize and annotate information.
I'm not sure why  is against it, and I greatly respect his opinion and am more than willing to be wrong about this, but it appears to me to be a very useful wallet simplification mechanism along the lines of BIP 32 (HD Wallets).
I've long ago imagined being able to see something nice on screen (thinking television here) -- with a QR code on it. Scan the QR code with a wallet. It cryptographically identifies the vendor to avoid scams and asks you where you'd like it shipped -- allowing you to choose addresses fully under your control? Is it for your brother, mother, loved one? Ship it there!
Boom, done!
Perhaps BIP 75 is the wrong way to allow this, but I'm not seeing the harm in it -- as it doesn't appear to modify the blockchain or consensus mechanisms.

In short, it makes the Bitcoin network operate more efficiently and more securely in several ways, and includes pathways for improvements the future.

Ask yourself question:
In the narrow context and timeframe of your transaction is there really a difference between the BTC, the fiat, and the bottle of wine?
They’re all tradable assets, the relative values of which are determined by the parties to the trade.
My point is that one doesn’t “drive” the other, the thing that “drive” all of them is value, and it’s independent of the others, though that changes over time.
Another big difference is liquidity — how easy it is to trade one for another.
Liquidity is not directly related to value. A pound of uranium is very valuable, but not many people want it, so it has low liquidity.
Bitcoin has low liquidity for now.

Bitcoin has been risky in the past, and I agree that caution is warranted as it could easily lose value in the future.
But neither of us have a crystal ball -- so your statement is entirely false as only time will tell, i.e. Bitcoin may be the least risky investment over the next six months -- there's simply no way to know in advance.
I didn't suggest it was safe, not likely to go down, etc.
I merely pointed out that volatility isn't an issue, just downward volatility. If Bitcoin went up very quickly it would be volatile and nobody holding it would have a problem with that.

One possible outcome out of an infinite number of possible outcomes:
Lending slows down, interests rates shoot sky high. The populace slowly weans itself off debt, lives low, and in a few decades work themselves out of debt slavery.
This would cause a massive decline in asset valuation supported by the debt slavery industry -- which makes it far easier to afford a house for those with assets such as Bitcoin.
In any case, we'll get to see what happens. It's not as though speculation of potential outcomes is going to stop people from using the best money ever.

Value is highly subjective.
While I don’t disagree with you WHY farmland is a terrific asset, it’s quite clear it will never be a MoE or UoA as it’s not fungible, has severe limits on divisibility, is costly to maintain, cannot be transacted over the internet in seconds, etc.
Consider that while farmland can be highly valuable, it’s not useful without a well run business operation. In fact, farmers go bankrupt on a regular basis — even though what you say is true.
So, even though OP didn’t intend to write “finest”, a generally used currency (which Bitcoin is NOT. Yet?) has historically been, or considered to be, the economies most-useful asset.

Assuming fee was .001 that's a hefty fee, so I'm not suggesting that you didn't pay enough or should have paid more, but it's important to note that there is no fixed fee which will guarantee fast transaction times, for several reasons:
  1) fees fluctuate continuously
  2) fee value is inversely proportional to transaction size in bytes
If your wallet requires you to set fees, it's now functionally obsolete and it's time to move to a new wallet.

The higher the interest rate on USD the lower the reason to take on additional risk.
Bitcoin is considered risky -- and clearly is in the short-term (any short term, not this short-term specifically) -- but risk is proportional to reward.
Another way to say it: lower interest on USD makes it less desirable, so other assets appreciate against it.
Hope that helps!

It is obviously better in every category, including the ones he mentions it failing in.
Even the idea that store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account are different are a complete misunderstanding of what money actually is.
The ONLY things that can stop Bitcoin from being the world's reserve currency are a crypto-failure or a reduction in adoption.
Adoption may be slow, but it's clearly picking up, and things are only just getting started.
P.S. How can anyone believe someone who says that in order to be money its value must be stable? GBP, EUR and others have been extremely unstable over the last week. Are they suddenly not money?
P.P.S. And let's be clear, the only stability in the world's fiat money is that they inflate continuously! Store of value? USD is worth less than 5% of what it was when the FRB was created.

I agree, they're critical different.
This is equivalent to what Gemini did: rolling back an event that was VALID from both a socially and technological viewpoint.
Smart contracts either enforced by code, or not. To the extent they're not, they're no different than what lawyers write today.
The historical Bitcoin event was rolling back a transaction that was INVALID, both by social and technological concerns -- and merely a bug in the code that enforces the rules.
While you could say the same about the contract, there's a big difference between a bad contract, and a bad enforcement system.
Ethereum's code is not tarnished by this event, only the contract itself.
Ethereum's reputation, IMHO, rests solely in it's ability to resist the social pressure to "do the right thing" -- and I do understand how strange that sounds. :-)

The problem, of course, is *exactly* at the juncture of crypto and fiat -- though the control and hassle is strategically placed there to keep you trapped in fiat, and control and monitor capital flows by the fiat system, not by Bitcoin.
So yes, it's a problem! Hell, it's THE PROBLEM!

If your business nets a 15% bottom line profit, you could receive 15% of your income in bitcoin and have ZERO need to convert bitcoin to fiat to pay your taxes — if you wanted to invest all of your profit in bitcoin.
I’ve been here a long time. The vendors who accept Bitcoin have never once suggested that anything like 15% of their income was received in bitcoin, 0% was far more likely, with the possible exception of Bitcoin business that operate entirely within the space.

But unless the global economy grows 100x -- which it may eventually -- a Satoshi doesn't have a chance at $5 -- a situation which would almost certainly require a hard fork to increase the divisibility.

Nobody knows.
Perhaps more importantly, there may never have been a liquid commodity with BTC's supply characteristics, which means nobody really knows what to compare it to.
Consider what happens during rising prices: 1) people want to buy and "make money", 2) people holding, particularly those they have been here before, aren't about to sell during an uptrend of such tiny proportions -- a "big increase" could be just around the corner!
Both of those things are true of other liquid commodities, but they're less volatile so the chemical rush is lessened.
And then there's the BIG difference: increasing price has little effect on short term supply and ZERO effect on long term supply. This is largely untrue for every other liquid asset.

While I understand your frustration and appreciate your sense of "fairness" I get the impression you may not understand the critical relationship between price and distribution.
When high level price-fixing occurs -- often "for the benefit of the people" -- it inevitably leads to distribution issues. In this case, the community "boycotting" BTMs would inevitably lead to a shortage of BTMs.
The lure of high returns -- even returns that one might easily consider outrageous -- is what is required to bootstrap something like a BTM network that covers the planet with BTMs.
As the market matures, competition will increase, the margins will come down, and BTMs will become commonplace.
But not if nobody uses them.
By all means save your money and use them infrequently. In fact, just HODL and only use them in true emergency situations.

The Winkelvoss brothers, Chamath Palihapitiya, and Tim Draper -- all apparently wealthy individuals -- may hold less than some kid who at 14 fired up bitcoind and had had it running ever since.
The wealthiest people in the world cannot force these early movers to sell their Bitcoin -- only tempt them to sell at higher and higher prices, which will indeed tempt them to sell some buy will also make it less necessary to sell large quantities.
So, I'm not convinced currently wealthy people can hold the majority...

No, they can choose to HODL any Bitcoin they receive.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:13:38
I think you missed my point.
Everything is gradual. All the companies are not going to wake up tomorrow and decide to accept BTC.
As the price rises, more people want BTC. Some of those people are merchants. If they're chasing customers by accepting BTC, it won't hurt but it won't help a lot either.
If they're chasing BTC by accepting it, it'll help a lot more -- as they're more likely to HODL it -- because they want it.
Which causes the price to rise. Rinse and repeat.
I ask myself every day, twice a day during bull runs "when will the reward outweigh the risk for most people?"
But I stop myself and realize that's how I thought in 2013 -- and those who bought in 2010 had **already** been wondering f where I was for 3 years.
But I got it, and my BTC are not for sale for fiat. Only for goods and services -- and those need to be extraordinary to get my BTC.
So the price rises because I value, hold, and accumulate.

There are two big buckets of data that are hashed together:
1) The block. Every miner assembles the block they say they choose from those available in their local mempool.
2) The nonce. A number chosen locally randomly or otherwise. Unless another competitor has the exact same block, the nonce doesn't really affect the "competition" as the difference(s) in the block(s) would make the use of the same nonce irrelevant.
If anything changes in either of those the hash will vary unpredictably.

No, it won't. He may sell or he may not.
With the information we have today, there is no way to calculate odds.
Satoshi mined a big chunk of the first 1M+ BTC, then the trail fades.
But that doesn't mean he stopped mining.
If you were he, who clearly desires to stay private and has been extraordinarily adept at doing so, would you spend the coin that would identify you, or the later ones that wouldn't?
Those early coins staying put doesn't mean a thing, and certainly isn't indicative in any statistical sense.

I agree with this statement, but it's important to understand that Bitcoin may not fit into the old vocabulary.
Did the internet fit into convenient boxes that were hundreds of years old?
There's never been anything like Bitcoin:
  1) Predictable, asymptotic increase in the supply
  2) Durable
  3) Exactly(!) divisible
  4) Natively "transmittable" -- though it never really moves at all
  5) Unforgeable
  6) Cryptographic integrity
  7) Apolitical(!)
  8) Cryptographically secure

You didn't meantion scarcity...
Most things on the planet have elastic supply: when the price rises more get made, or mined. Teslas and tulips share this quality with fiat currencies.
A surprisingly few items are highly scarce: masterpiece artworks, Porphyry (particularly when also a masterpiece artwork!) and ultra-rare cars, comic books and baseball cards come to mind.
Bitcoin is much closer to the latter group than the former in scarcity, but it's fantastically cheaper and easier to secure and transact, and it's entirely immune to counterfeiting...
Both groups have an aesthetic advantage over bitcoin -- unless you have a very high appreciation of cryptography and/or computer science! ��
You also didn't specifically mention non-politicality: the USD can be used to transact worldwide, as can Bitcoin as you mentioned. But the USD is red, white and blue at its heart, and very few people live in the USA so they'd no-doubt prefer to transact in a global currency that doesn't get manipulated according to the needs, wants and will of the USG.
And then there's censorship resistance: because Bitcoin is decentralized, no single entity can control what transactions get processed, freeze funds, or alter balances.
In short, best money ever!

The idea that intent is fundamental to smart contracts largely eliminates the advantages of distributed, crypto contracts -vs- traditional contracts -- the entire point is to remove ambiguity, improve predictability, and thereby lower costs.
And comparing The DAO to the Antwerp diamond heist is farcical! Far more people have lost far more money, and far more regularly after signing poorly written and/or undesirable contracts!
It makes me sick to think of all of The DAO's investors losing all of their money. But it makes me far more sick to think of how many really poor people have been victimized by pay day loan sharks, prepaid and gift cards with highly monthly fees, etc.
You must read the fine print, and not sign contracts you don't understand. Nobody invested ETH into The DAO without knowing *precisely* what an early experiment both Ethereum itself and The DAO's contracts were.
They invested *precisely* due to high potential reward involved. High reward is always accompanied with high risk -- particularly when someone makes an investment without performing proper due diligence.
In the case of The DAO, the riskiness wiped out the rewards, and moved the capital of the investors elsewhere. How is that different than investing in a startup company that goes bankrupt?

Many people are followers, so some may jump aboard say they can say "me too!".
But, at the end of the day, the only thing that will get vendors to take bitcoin is vendors' own desire to have bitcoin.
I consider this a very good thing, and and one of the best reasons against the argument to spend bitcoin to create an economy.
HODLing bitcoin drives the price up. For those that have a direct need for it today, don't appreciate it's unique characteristics and/or don't "get it" the only way to make people want bitcoin is to appeal to their greed by HODLing which forces the price up.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:33:49
Because the simplest and perhaps only way to make people want bitcoin is to give them a reason to have it.
As progressive waves of people realize it has been a good investment over the vast majority of its life, they will buy -- which will raise the price.
As vendors realize the opportunity, they will rush accept it, which will increase its usefulness.
Rinse and repeat until everyone has some. :-)

It may drop in relation to fiat currency, but I suspect we both believe it'll be higher in the future.
If you sell you may end up with less Bitcoin if it goes up!
If you hold and continue to add, you're guaranteed to have more than you have now.
It's your choice, but really think you should wait until fees are minimal, and recommend never s point for fiat.
When fees are low you can do a consolidation transaction to a single address, then when you buy in the future you can transfer to the same address (so long as you don't spend from it, you should never send from same address twice).
Accumulating into a single address will reduce fees in the future, but will reduce your privacy as well.
Consider: if you don't sell, you don't have to do anything and you don't have to pay any fees!
You think it may go down. I think it may go up.
Selling because you "feel" it may go down is a fear based decision. In my experience, fear based decisions haven't been my best.

SegWit in the short term and ⚡️ in the mid term will work together to lessen fees.
Longer term there are block size increases (when it's clearly safe to do so) and transaction efficiency measures.
Essentially the entire G20 runs on $.30 + 2.5%+ for untrustworthy, reversible transactions -- so it's hard to tell what people are willing to pay for the fantastic transactional qualities of Bitcoin.
But you can bet that large transactions are going to be extremely popular due to the fees being independent of the value transferred.
Everything else is going move to ⚡️or some other off-chain system, or get transacted elsewhere.

So again, by your definition, EUR is not money because I don't use it.
Bitcoin is as many of: money, store of value, unit of account, and payment system as anyone uses it for, even if only part of the time.
I have (admitted rarely) used BTC for all purposes, as I have used USD, EUR, GBP, Gold, Silver, company stock, Visa, MasterCard, Amex, etc. in the past.
Of all of those things, I use USD predominantly, but clearly the rest perform the same service as money, i.e. representing value.
The reason Bitcoin sweeps the table, and breaks the molds of ALL existing economic theory (though clearly aligning more closely with Austrian theory) is they there's never been anything that could perform all functions with equal ease.
Think it through for yourself. We all produce value and barter with everyone else for their value. Money is wherever you choose to hold your accumulated value so long as others will trade it for other things of value.
Those trades are typically made through currency, which I've heard described as the most desirable commodity -- whatever its origins or properties -- at the time.
Desirability is key because it leads to widespread acceptance, which promotes desirability.
Bitcoin is clearly weakest in "moneyness" with respect to acceptance at this point. As (if?) more people desire it, acceptance will follow.

ARPAnet was TCP/IP.
I have little reason to believe that doesn't make it the earliest part of the internet.

Speak for yourself, please.
Bitcoin is the best currency I've ever held.


To gain widespread currency status and stable value, Bitcoin MUST rise in value tremendously to handle higher value transactions and provide increased liquidity.
In order to rise in value, it cannot be stable.
It's not stability Bitcoin needs to become widespread -- it's been growing steadily BECAUSE of the MASSIVE (upward) instability it's been experiencing since 2010.
So, in short, what needs to change for Bitcoin is for more people to want it.
As that continues to happen, some of those people will continue to be vendors, who will choose to acquire it by accepting it for their goods and services.

Yes, but I clearly stated:


You're spreading the idea that the lack of "consumer protection" that credit cards provide is, actually, a detriment to the consumer.
I believe it's plainly obvious that said "consumer protection" is actually a rather nasty bit of double-speak and/or a euphemism designed to mask the fact that wide-spread use of credit cards has raised consumer pricing by 3%.
Most consumers have *never* needed to reverse a credit card charge. In order to be an actual consumer protection, the rate of reversals would need to be around 1 in 33 transactions as credit card fees to merchants (which are always passed along to consumers) are generally in the 3% range.
Most credit card reversals would be HAPPILY handled by merchant if given the chance (yes, consumers do just reverse charges without discussing with the merchant) to avoid merchant charge-back fees which generally amount to purchase price + $30-40.
It sucks to sell a coffee for $3 and then weeks later be charged $33 because the consumer didn't remember purchasing a coffee from you...yet this happens all the time.

It's currently inflationary with 12.5 being created every 10 minutes.
Eventually, the loss rate through key loss and burning will be higher than the creation rate.
At that point it's deflationary.
Things priced in Bitcoin have dropped in price relative to Bitcoin quite dramatically. Since many people conflate price increases with inflation, and price decreased with deflation, Bitcoin has been effectively deflationary since the beginning.

Yeah, no, definitely not the one embarrassing myself here.
You left off the rest of that sentence: all markets are open 24/7, and all information is evenly distributed.
Insider trading involves trading on information that other market participants do no possess. As an example, an executive at a company selling his/her stock knowing that a huge deal fell through before the market knows the deal fell through.
Bitcoin's code is open source, so there's no means of manipulating the function of Bitcoin without other market participants noticing. This negates the possibility of selling Bitcoin right before an update comes out that changes the rules of the game.
In addition, the bitcoin markets have APIs that anyone can use to view the exchange order books in realtime. Such transparency is generally not available in traditional markets without exorbitant fees to access that information.
And, of course, you failed to answer a simple question I put to you and instead turned to ad hominem. Nevertheless I'll ask it again since it's pretty clear you cannot answer it:
How, exactly, do you define market manipulation and insider trading in the context of Bitcoin?

Transaction fees are related to transaction size, and transaction size is related to number of input addresses and output addresses, so I his is incorrect.

No, I don't see it that way at all.
I see Bitcoin as Bitcoin -- something entirely different than other things. The reason why people have a hard time fitting Bitcoin into the old boxes is because it's a brand new thing.
There's absolutely no way, IMHO, to practically encourage vendor acceptance.
The reason vendors exist is because they want income. Today, they want that income in the currency that they've already received it.
As soon as they want Bitcoin, they'll accept it. Vendors like BitPay don't help with acceptance. IMHO they perpetuate the idea that Bitcoin **isn't** a currency they'd want to have. And yes, I know that BitPay allows vendors to choose which percentage they wish to receive in Bitcoin.
When vendors want my Bitcoin they'll beg me for it. At that point, I'll be willing to part with some.

Mining was designed to be break even.
It's obvious by it's design if you think about it for a bit.
It's been capital intensive to design ASICs and move to continuously smaller process manufacturing, but it will eventually flatten out and that best you'll be able to hope for is pay the cost of running your mining node -- which is exactly what was intended in the first place.

You seem to be arguing against yourself. Fax machines were one of the most quickly adopted technologies ever, despite the fact that they were/are a bit clunky to use -- not unlike the internet in the early days.


Money that doesn't become worthless over time.
Money that increases in value over time.
Money that cannot be frozen and/or confiscated under any circumstances.
Money that can be transferred "anywhere" in a few minutes.
These are the base qualities of Bitcoin that are superior to fiat.
Add in future benefits that will be built by developers upon a universally programmable money system, and it'll make fiat look like a fax machine -vs- the modern web.

Every vendor will take Bitcoin when every vendor wants Bitcoin.
Every vendor will want Bitcoin when they see that taking Bitcoin results in more wealth for them in the future than taking fiat.
Awareness is growing. The best way for vendors to get in the game is to accept it. It's super easy to do, they can download a wallet and announce that they take it. The great thing for them is no fees for vendor (unlike plastic) and no exchange fees since it's direct.
So few people have and are willing to spend Bitcoin that they will not be overwhelmed with Bitcoin purchases, so far quite the opposite. If they really want Bitcoin they can offer a discount to offset the fees and exchange rates they're avoiding.

That's the beauty of markets, nobody needs to ask.
I don't ask for high fees, but I *do* appreciate the extremely high security that the large miners are providing.
If they quit, *and* many users jumped into mining, I *think* the hash rate would likely fall.

We can agree on that, but that's not a reason to suggest Bitcoin is more analogous to physical currency than digital currency.
I've done some informal study that suggests to me that there's currently at least $100T+ of fiat currency (physical and electronic), gold, silver, art and other non-real-estate stores of value world−wide.

I think the reason it's easy to think this is due to focusing on the creation on new Bitcoin, which is just the reward for doing the real work of securing the network from attack.
Your model of electricity being "wasted" or "destroyed" presumes there's something more important that should be done with it.
But many people use electricity in many way, for many purposes: running machinery, heating buildings, electroplating, etc.
If you think of it that way, then Bitcoin simply uses electricity to usefully secure the network.

St. Louis Fed Adjusted Monetary base increasing from 800B to 4000B does, I believe, indicate that.
Am I to believe that you believe the definitions of M1-3 — and who uses them — are critical to the amount of currency that exists?
I understand that they’re intended to measure that very thing, but that doesn’t mean they’re accurate, or can be with certainty.
Consider how the definition of inflation has changed over time. Definitions change, but there is a certain amount of fiat in existence and with the current system it’s not even clear how accurate any of these metrics are.
You speak as though you’re brighter, more knowledgeable, and who knows what other superior attributes your ego is lying to you about at the moment.

Value is subjective.
The current value is the balance between willingness to hold and desire to trade for something else.
The only force that can turn bitcoin into a commonly accepted means of payment is a common desire to hold it.
Accumulating is the *only* way a bitcoin supporter can signal their belief that Bitcoin is the future.
If we hold tight enough, the rising price will convince others they too should be holding. At that point, vendors will *want* to accept bitcoin, because they too will desire to hold it.

Bitcoin is well suited at this stage of its development to very quickly send large amounts of value across great distances and political boundaries at very low fees.
The difficulty and suitability are greatly diminished, however, if one wants to start in a fiat currency, transfer through Bitcoin, then end in a fiat currency.
In that case, the fiat &lt;-&gt; bitcoin steps will incur a time, fee, and regulatory penalty that *may* increase the difficulty an lower the suitability to the point where it might be simpler to use a provider like TransferWise.
That said, if one or both parties wish to accumulate bitcoin, then that would nearly certainly tip the scale back into bitcoin's direction.

No, it requires zero permission to use. It's simply not free.


[The original white paper]( doesn't mention free usage.
Do you realize that Bitcoin mining is required to run the network, is required to keep the network secure, costs money to operate, is incredibly competitive, and will require fees to operate in the future?
Why would miners accept any transaction with zero or very low fee that they will have to pay the costs of mining? Also keep in mind that zero fee means the network is free to SPAM as well...

The reason so many people believe reading is best is because it was the first mass education tool and is very inexpensive to create and distribute.
Human to human is super expensive, audio and video are relative newcomers and until very recently have been more expensive than reading.

Some believe it’s “important” to use Bitcoin transactionally. One way to do so is spend and replace instantly, so you encourage Bitcoin usage while maintaining your Bitcoin balance.
I prefer to keep traffic off chain so that transactions that Bitcoin adds value to have more space on chain.
Bitcoin can, and will in my opinion, become a widespread transactional currency only after it becomes the most popular liquid store of value.

While it does translate to mining activity in some ways, it does not translate anywhere near directly to cost of mining.
The cost of mining is likely most highly correlated to the security required to secure the blockchain. It's unclear what that relationship is.


The security boogie-man is real-enough, but we've been here before and come through the other end, and we will do it again. I remember tons of people saying "I'll never use an ATM card", "I'll never use my ATM card on the internet", etc.
This history of technology is littered with people saying "this will never happen because..." and they're pretty much always wrong. This is *so common* I cannot believe you're suggesting it's a serious issue.
In the late 80's and early 90's, for instance, people said desktop publishing would *never* replace typesetting machines because they were unable to match the quality of kerning (space between letters) the typesetting machines provided.
Of course, that problem was fixed. As were problems with half-tone screening which popped up later than kerning did.
Two decades later, the web has largely eliminated the entire business of printing and publishing.


I think this is true in every country. If it wasn't true, nobody would use a credit card, *because this is such a common occurrence with credit cards, because they're entirely insecure.*

We do have a market for resources and it is working.
Markets encourage matching supply with demand and allowing for profit in doing so.
Limited blocksize is centrally controlled resource allocation. While this is often done with the best intentions, it always fails miserably.
As for orphaned blocks, how is this a problem for users? I understand it's hard on miners, but it can happen for a variety of reasons and it's simply part of the game.
In fact, I see it as a nice counter-balance to prevailing forces currently driving mining capacity to cold areas with low electricity cost, which is itself a form of centralization.

The "problem" of low-bandwidth miners is a very strange one to me.
Why does everyone obsess about this one thing? There are *many* details that give some miners advantages over others: bandwidth cost, bandwidth availability, hashing capacity, electricity cost, labor cost, datacenter cost, etc.
They *all* boil down to capital requirements, i.e. the miner with the most capital wins every time: they can locate where they choose, buy the latest equipment, hire the best people, etc. This is a very old advantage.
I fully understand that Bitcoin should be kept decentralized, and that the more decentralized it is, the more robust and desirable it is. I'm all for it.
So why the obsession over bandwidth, when it's just one of many variables that go into the very complex equation that, when solved, will inevitably cause the best miners to become the largest?

Confirmations come at the rate of 1 per block found.
It looks like your transaction has very high miner preference and will likely be included in the next block.
Blocks are, on average, always 10 minutes from being found -- regardless of how long ago the last block was found.
Sometimes blocks aren't found for more than 10 minutes.
Your transaction is going to be just fine.
P.S. Lightning Network entirely resolves confirmation uncertainly and greatly lowers fees. It's in its infancy (or early toddlership) so it's likely not a solution for you currently but is very much something to pay attention to and likely use in the future.
EDIT: I see that several blocks have been found since the transaction was broadcast. Looks like your fee must have been a tiny bit too low...

That £100 for Christmas could be £1,000 (or more) by next Christmas (or sooner).
To be fair, it could be zero as well, but that seems increasingly less likely IMHO.
If you don’t need the £, I’d recommend moving it into a wallet you control the private keys for, making sure you’ve backed up your seed words carefully and securely, sit back and watch it rise.

Wow, that's a bit overstated. Is there zero room for people simply wishing to trade assets for Bitcoin? Or for those wishing to expand the ecosystem by accepting Bitcoin and converting to fiat for the inventory they need to continue the cycle, while HODLing the profits?


Prohibitively expensive, or simply more expensive?
Business plans will need to be sharper to gain investors, which means lower mal-investment.


So, let me get this straight. During the gold standard era, money didn't circulate, and no wealth was generated.
That's a fascinating interpretation of history.


Not used anymore? Tell that to people in India, people who use pawn shops, and central banks.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, currency -vs- store of value -vs- unit of account. I believe those are arbitrary distinctions due largely to fact that there's hasn't been a single currency that could function as well three in the modern era.


Seems to me they've happened since as well.

The "problem" with gold-as-a-currency, particularly now, is that settlement is a bitch for anything less than relatively small amounts, and its purely physical nature makes it useless in an increasingly digital world.
The "problem" with Bitcoin is that almost nobody knows what it is, those that truly do have minimal authority, the media has branded it, in a sadly understandable way, as a criminal tool.
Yet it has faced all of that and flourished. I'm not blind to the fact that its value is down, but given the lack of understanding of what it is and how much the world can benefit from its acceptance, pricing volatility doesn't surprise or discourage me on its future.
The only thing more preposterous than Bitcoin being a major currency in the future is it having gotten to this point to begin with.

Your statement contradicts itself.
If it’ll be hoarded, then those who want to hoard it will be happy to sell me things for it.
Bitcoin isn’t deflationary for 120 years. At that point it’s value should increase with the value of the global economy, which has been around 4% a year forever.
The rest of your inflation was based upon observed usage of gold — which has enormous issues with security, transactability, and divisibility which, IMHO, are the reasons it doesn’t make a good currency.
Bitcoin demonstrates none of those weaknesses.

My point is that when discussing confirmation between BTC and BCH it's misleading to claim "fast and free" -vs- "slow and expensive" because that suggests that when you pay the expensive BTC fees, then they're every bit as fast as BCH confirmations when BCH is running well (has hash power pointed at it) and is faster than BCH when BCH is not running well (doesn't have hash power pointed at it).

Every exchange is a market unto itself.
A process known as arbitrage -- buying on a low priced exchange, and immediately selling on a high priced exchange -- tends to drive prices at exchanges together as the buying-low drives the price up on the low exchange, and the selling-high drives the price down on the high exchange.
For some reason it's difficult to arbitrage your exchange, or it's a new exchange that nobody is yet effectively arbitraging it.
You could buy on other exchanges and sell there for a €500/bitcoin profit. Perhaps you should!

Just pointing out that to you, “possible” appears to mean “likely” or “inevitable” and “may” or “could” appear to mean “is”, “are” or “will.”
I’ll take this moment to point out that appear to believe that Russian and Chinese business people are inherently untrustworthy.
And then there’s your apparent premises that the only measure of value is USD and that exchanges must keep equivalent present value in USD on hand of all the the items ever exchanged on them in order to maintain liquidity.
You also appear to believe, with great confidence, that people have huge amounts of USD in their exchange accounts in an ecosystem designed to avoid the need for custodial risk and, in fact, actively preaches against leaving any value in exchanges for longer than strictly required.
Or the fact that historically, exchange issues have already happened at gigantic scale and have not had the catastrophic outcome you’re predicting — and those issues were, in every single case that I’m aware of, a loss of BTC rather than USD...

In this case there was no “other” fee, just a single exchange rate.
These machines commonly buy from an exchange at the market rate for each BTC purchase.
They should not and cannot buy and sell at the same price, and there are also the network fees to be considered.
The vendors need to capitalize the machine, pay rent for it’s location, and manage the cash inside of it.
To suggest they’re making “extra” profit is a ridiculously simplistic and non-empathetic viewpoint that is incredibly common in these parts.

I guess it all hinges on what the definition of “broad” is.
I believe Bitcoin has a few uses where it may well be considered as a currency. With the confines of darknet markets it almost certainly qualifies, and there are probably others as well, porn comes to mind, for instance.
On chain transaction characteristics make it a less than ideal currency at the moment, I believe Lightning Network (⚡️) is about to fix that issue.
If it does, Bitcoin earns the trifecta: store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange.


Nothing in the definition mentioned easy, and it’s not even clear that Bitcoin’s fractional units are more difficult to compare than the units you’re more accustomed to. Finally, a shift to millibits, microbits, or satoshi can and will occur should the market prefer those units.
As for stability, that’s just a matter of dominance. As usage grows, value will rise and being price stability. The end game is where Bitcoin is considered stable because everything else is measured against it, which gives the appearance of stability.

I did some googling and, to my dismay, cannot quickly find a way to support my claim.

Useless to the business?
I’ve been in business since the 80’s and never once called something the business owned that rose in value “useless.”
I seriously doubt any business that accepts Bitcoin and fiat has ever been overwhelmed by Bitcoin orders which resulted in a cash crunch.
If your business is healthy and makes a 15% profit, 1% of sales (max) being paid by Bitcoin isn’t going to be a problem.
And should Bitcoin continue to rise, it won’t be hard to convince employees and vendors to accept it, they’ll be begging you for it.

It’s not ready for widespread use as a currency since it can handle neither the volume nor the confirmation time requirements of a currency.

No, I don’t think you understand how ⚡️ works.

You’ll have 1 or more channels open with the hub of your choice. The hotel will have 1 or more channels open.
You’ll use your channel to route a payment through the network to their channel.
⚡️ is like your checking account, as opposed to your savings account. You’ll only open and close channels as often as you transfer money to and from your savings account, and for the same reasons.
Some people choose to think of ⚡️ as tying their bitcoin up. I see it as freeing your bitcoin to transact quickly, inexpensively, and frequently — just like moving money to your checking account frees it from the 3 transaction per month limit many savings accounts impose.

No, it doesn’t.
All it requires is a demand that is greater than supply.
Bitcoin is ultra-scarce. Most things on the planet have an elastic supply where more demand causes more production.
Bitcoin is immune to that. It’s level of scarcity is closer to a dead artist’s masterpieces or red porphyry than it is to anything else.
Once big, patient money moves in, the price will go vertical as the supply drys up.

Nobody has a crystal ball, but there’s at least some evidence of a relationship between cost of mining and price of bitcoin that appears to work bidirectionally.
As the hash rate rises and difficulty adjusts, miners must demand higher prices for their new coins to continue operations. This raises the price.
As the price rises due to increased demand, miners bring on more hash rate to benefit from the increased price.
So long as demand continues to rise, mining will sort itself out IMHO.

Because first and foremost, money must be secure and trusted.
Bitcoin is far, far ahead on these issues.
Development of Bitcoin has been hamstrung by the block size issue. That issue is behind us, and SegWit is activated. One of the features of SegWit is the ability to deploy multiple soft forks in parallel, so development is now able to proceed far faster than previously.

Yeah, I hear you...bitcoin rising continuously this year has really stressed me out. I can barely sleep.
I feel much happier when I check bitcoin in the morning and find that it didn't rise overnight.
When I wake up and find myself wealthier when I went to sleep I always know a headache is coming my direction. I've taken more aspirin this year that I have in the rest of my life.
One practical benefit, however, is that as bitcoin rises in value, it can be used to transfer larger and larger sums of value. This will come in handy as it looks increasingly likely that in the future, I may be in the market for expensive estates, planes, and automobiles and I wouldn't want to shake the market as I begin to diversify my wealth.

The transactions are Bitcoin transactions, reference real coins on the Bitcoin network, and has cryptographic integrity.
And, the coins **are** yours because you can immediately spend them for goods, services, and other cryptocurrencies (via atomic swaps) without the need to settle on the blockchain.
I understand your point that when you receive coins they're not recorded on the blockchain. But that's not the same as as what you're describing, which is to say I think you're overstating your point.
For instance, how is Lightning Network any different **in effect** than multiply-confirmed transactions on the blockchain **if you lose your private keys**?
The only way Lightning Network transactions aren't yours is **if you lose them**, which is effectively the same as losing your private keys on the main chain...

I’m saying stable currency is an illusion, particularly so with inflationary fiat: it’s **guaranteed** to be unstable!
For a currency to be stable, you’d need to be able to buy the same item for the same amount of money, right?
And if two different places charge different amounts of a currency for the same items, how is the currency stable?
And before you reply with anything containing the work “basket” or a similar word or concept, how is the basket chosen and does the composition change over time?
The whole idea is preposterous and devolves into price fixing, which invariably leads to distribution problems.

This is the fundamental question of Bitcoin at the moment.
Does the community support Core who's extremely careful, decentralization is the most important measure of Bitcoin -vs- Bitcoin Cash/SegWit 2x approaches that either disagree that centralization will increase with larger blocks, or with the importance of remaining **highly** decentralized system.
Right now the community appears to me be siding with Core. I certainly do at this moment.
But if Lightning Network fails to gain traction within a year or so (the sooner the better, transaction demand continues to significantly outstrip capacity, and fees remain elevated, then I suspect the community will apply pressure on Core to do something about it.
I'm personally optimistic. I think the Core team is fantastic, and is making difficult and, perhaps, heroic decisions to "first, do no harm" as M.D.s put it.

Either way, the health of Bitcoin in the future is far more important to me than the price of bitcoin in the present, so let’s not be hasty.

We’ll “never” lose them all, as bitcoin is finely divisible with 100,000,000 satoshis per bitcoin.

I simply pointed out that the reasoning that "the government won't allow it to happen" is clearly flawed: if the government cannot force people to pay taxes, it cannot force them to not use Bitcoin.
So few people seem to grok this! Governments rarely have the control of the populace that is ascribed to them. Once the people have decided change is needed, the change either happens, or more and more people start lingering around the capital building until a helicopter whisks away the existing leaders.

I understand the problem, but I don't think it should be singled out and controlled when so many other variables, such as electrical costs and low ambient temperature, cannot.
Everyone is concerned about limited Chinese bandwidth. To me it's a counter-balance against low-cost electricity.
Chinese miners have a big chunk of hashing power due to lower costs than many other places. Larger blocks would, perhaps, prevent mining from becoming centralized there.
The protocol should not mould to the shape of the mining network, quite the opposite.

On the other hand, most people I've discussed this with directly who disagree with Core's approach tend to make decisions based upon fear.
I don't believe for a moment that Core and/or Blockstream are making decisions that are bad for Bitcoin as a whole, but good for Blockstream. To the extent that Blockstream's interests do leak into Core's decision, they do so with what appears to be overwhelming community support.

I spent a month in Europe last summer. We arrived the day after Brexit.

And sometimes, in Europe, we could see an item like an egg, cross the street, and find an egg at another location for a very different price. In fact, this has been the case for my entire life, in my home currency and everywhere I've traveled.
I've been through several stock market booms and busts.

During the busts, were the stocks falling, or the dollar rising?
Volatility is all about fear and speculation. Bitcoin markets are, today, fearful, illiquid, and highly "manipulated" (though I use that term very loosely) by large buyers and sellers.
There is nothing intrinsic to Bitcoin that makes it volatile. There's not been a new contender for a universal world-wide currency since gold. If nothing goes wrong with the technology, the volatility will likely decrease over time.
Speaking of volatility, it's IMPOSSIBLE for a currency to spring into existence as worthless and backed by nothing and grow in usage without being massively UPWARDLY volatile.
People who speak of volatility being bad generally are thinking of the value decreasing. The truth is, people LOVE BITCOIN VOLATILITY when it's upwardly volatile. Whenever you hear someone describing how volatile it is and discuss it as a warning and bad thing, they either know they're deceiving their audience, or don't know what they're talking about.
Given the choice between a "stable" currency (that is actually continuously becoming worth less and less over time through inflation) and a "volatile" currency that has outperformed nearly all other asset classes since attaining a value in 2010, more and more people are choosing Bitcoin.

While they’re not technically similar, I think the easiest way to think of LN is as your checking account -vs- your savings account (on chain).
In the US, and perhaps elsewhere, savings accounts are generally limited in transaction count per month, commonly 3 maximum, which makes your savings account inappropriate for day to day transactions.
Opening a LN channel is a bit like transfering money from savings to checking: a single transaction in itself that allows you to use your money freely and easily compared to the money in your savings account.
Detractors say LN “ties up” your money. From my perspective LN sets your bitcoin free: fast (millisecond confirmation -vs- 10 minutes) and cheap.
So fast and cheap they even micro-transactions — long awaited and suddenly within grasp — like paying a few cents fiat per web page viewed, in lieu of advertising and/or subscriptions.

The his is entirely, absolutely, emphatically untrue.
There is a buy for every sale, whether the price is rising or falling.
If a ton are sold, i.e. 1M, then today that would certainly cause the price to fall because there is not that much demand. When selling a bunch causes the market to move down, that's known as slippage.
Given the recent price stability, it would appear that supply and demand are nicely matched, including the 3,600 new BTC being created each day.

SegWit is a new transaction format that applications need to be updated to use, and miners need to support by including SegWit transactions in blocks.
To date, [around 11% of transactions]( are using SegWit and those account for about 8% of the size of blocks.
Blocks are [now larger than 1M bytes]( by about 10-20% at this time. A few miners (AntPool, 1Hash, BW.com, Bitcoin.com and perhaps others) are refusing to mine SegWit transactions which is artificially constraining capacity as well.
A very significant amount of hash power is occasionally being diverted to mine the Bitcoin Cash chain. It has an emergency difficulty adjustment (EDA) that quickly raises and lowers difficulty. [It's being gamed to hyperinflate BCH to miners' benefit](
This is odd. One of the main points of BCH is to lower transaction fees, yet miners have [collected over 122,000 BCH in block rewards ahead of schedule]( which are socialized transaction fees paid by all holders whether they're transacting or not.
When mining hash rate switches to the BCH chain, the BTC chain slows down, lowering transaction capacity.
So, it's reasonable to blame miners for the current high BTC fees. They blame the Core developers, but it's their choices and direct actions by and large that are directly responsible for the current fee situation.

I'll give you he euphoria you described, that suggesting that we're happy about Greecian suffering is certainly not true in my case.
Bitcoin believers (and others) have seen this coming and tried to alert people who said "it cannot happen" -- which is to say we tried to avoid the suffering entirely.
Will the Greek situation benefit BTC adoption and price? Perhaps.
I certainly hope so as I'd prefer people worldwide, including the billions of unbanked, have a personally secured and non-political store of wealth and currency.
Because when a significant portion do, the world becomes less centralized, which I see as a very good thing.

Apparently you were told wrong. There never was such a thing. Some wallets had predefined fees, to be sure, but that's a choice you made when choosing your wallet.
Also, who told you Bitcoin was perfect. The developer's have released 0.10.x -- a far cry from 1.0 -- and everyone knows software typically reaches maturity somewhere after 2.0.
Bitcoin is an entirely new monetary system. It looks to many to have a shot at being the best one yet. It'll take time.

Your wallet will show the transaction immediately as unconfirmed.
If the transaction confirms once it’ll add a confirmation about once every ten minutes, on average.
One confirmation is a good sign. 6 confirmations and it’s written in stone. Depending on the size of your transaction and your trust in the payee, you can deliver at zero (small
amount and full trust in customer) to 6 (large amount and distrust of customer) confirmations.

This is due to an ongoing test/attack of the Bitcoin network. The network has been working very (surprisingly?) well during this event, but it has, at a minimum, highlighted the need for all software creating transactions to use a better algorithm to determine the proper fee.
The excellent [bitcoinfees.github.io]( shows that to be confirmed as we've grown accustomed to the required fee for your transaction, which is quite large (nearly 18 kB) is currently around .00738.
Your transaction paid "only" 0.00191387 in fees, so it's going to take a while to process.

Free markets, and my experience, suggest the only reasonable answer to your question is "charge as much as you can," which is to say "as much as the market will bear."
Since you don't know how long it will take, time and materials is the only reasonable way to go.
Bitcoin is highly specialized. I'd start with double the hourly rate you've charged previously for less specialized work. Negotiate down if you must, but if you get it, raise it again the next time.
EDIT: one mistake young folks make is to feel like they shouldn't charge for learning time. Learning is a skill, some are better at it than others. Particularly in tech, things change constantly, so if you don't charge for learning you may never charge at all.

Do you not understand the transitive relationship?
When you exchange a for b on a market, both parties are agreeing:
    a = b
So a cannot be worth something different than b **at the moment of the exchange**.
If, at that same **moment of exchange**, you exchange b for c, then that's agreeing:
    b = c
So, again, **at the time of the exchange**, it's guaranteed that:
    a = c
As time proceeds, that relationship breaks down, as the exchange rates fluctuate.
I keep track of my purchasing power in a (USD in my case) as it's convenient because most items are still priced in a and I've spent my entire life thinking about a, but I'm 100% cognizant of the fact that my actual wealth is increasingly measured in the amount of (b)itcoin that I hold -- which I do occasionally trade for c (of various kinds), and may potentially trade for a should the need arise.
To be honest, I'm not even sure what you think is the problem, other than a vague idea that it's possible that the entire ecosystem (though you speak entirely about exchanges) is **potentially** illiquid.
Your last comment seemed to indicate that you **may** think that the exchanges are, in fact, **completely** illiquid due to some sort of fundamental flaw.

Because it's the ultimate way to keep the blockchain as small as possible over its lifetime, and it resolved at least one economic issue (lower cost of creating UTXOs than destroying them) and technical debt (malleability).
Luke is the most vocal and ardent defender of making sure the blocksize doesn't grow beyond most people's ability to validate it. This is a straight-forward statement of keeping the actual size of blocks as small as possible, nothing more.

The bitcoin block reward is reduced by half every 4 years in an event known as a halving.
For the first four years, miners were rewarded 50 BTC every 10 minutes (approximately, on average).
For the next four years, 25 every 10 minutes.
Currently 12.5 every ten minutes.
In about 17 months, 6.25.

This is an ultra-complex discussion.
If it appears simple, it’s because you don’t know enough.
Nobody “supports” fees, but they are absolutely critical to the long term health of the network.
Do you run a full node? If so, you’d understand that the larger the blockchain, the longer it takes to sync initially, which limits the number of people willing to run a full node. Fewer nodes run by fewer individuals means higher centralization, which could easily lead to censorship, etc.
Miners will require fees to continue to increase and maintain the hash rate. The block subsidy is designed to reduce every four years (halving) which means that miners’ current revenue stream is dwindling away. That MUST be replaced by fees to maintain the network.
There are other subtleties involved, but this issue is constrained by security requirements, not consumer satisfaction with fees.
Which is to say that on-chain Bitcoin transactions ARE gold, and were designed to be gold.
Fortunately the solution is at hand.
The Lightning Network (⚡️) provides for nearly instantaneous, ultra-low-fee transactions.
Independent of fees, on chain transactions are, always have been, and always will be — unless someone figures out something one hell of a lot more clever than increasing the block size — entirely unacceptable for wide-spread retail use.
⚡️ fixes that completely AND provides for improved privacy as well.

Sharding is a great database scaling technology that has been in use for decades.
The problem with sharding in the context of Bitcoin -- or any crypto -- is that it breaks the tenent of "you don't need to trust anyone."
Because it allows on-chain scaling by splitting the blockchain up into slices, which means you can throw multiple computers at it.
But that also means that in order to trust no one you'll need multiple computers to and validate every transaction yourself.
And since the full (inclusive of all slices) "chain" is not size-limited, in addition to multiple computers you also need enough bandwidth to handle all of those transactions.
If you really want Bitcoin to stay decentralized, trust-free, and censorship-resistant, SegWit + Lightning Network is the best tradeoff IMHO.

Fair doesn't have much meaning in economics.
Should we limit the number of apple trees farmers can plant in order to maintain the price of apples for farmers? Or let the market determine how many should be planted, driving the price down by consumers?
The market can break. A monopoly can for, for instance, and that is a concern. I don't believe that there's anything we can do to prevent that, however: capital tends to pile up.
The question becomes "should we pull levers and, if so, what levers should we pull?"
One thing many people fail to understand is that price and distribution are typically connected. If you control pricing, you break distribution, and vice-versa.
Mining is strange because mining has, as far as I can tell, zero locality, so distribution probably isn't a concern in the classical sense, but distribution may imply (de)centralization I this case.
To believe that we can control centralization -vs- decentralization or the general health of the network via blocksize seems incredibly naive to me.
To attempt to control size via mining fee and understand what the outcome might be is a bit closer to preposterous, no offense intended. What's the baseline? How much profit should miners be allowed? Measured in what currency. If Bitcoin, which is classically volatile, should exchange rate matter?
Yikes, I may have nightmares tonight. :-)

99% certain they were writing about paper wallets.
Bitcoins are NOT created in single units and aren’t identified by IDs.
They are created per block, as the block reward. Originally 50 were created per block for 4 years, then 25 per block for four years, now 12.5 per block for nearly 3 years, with 1 year to go before 6.25.
Those block reward coins are the combined (via transaction inputs) and split (via transaction outputs).
All bitcoin amounts are tracked by nodes in a structure known as the UTXO (unspent transaction output) database, which can be recreated directly from the blockchain.
Hope this helps.

I never said big companies with more than a million Euros in revenue per year.
What you're effectively saying is "it isn't happening because it hasn't happened yet!"
Of course, if that were true (in general) it would prove that no technology could ever become widespread.
In the [70s and 80s]( anyone could have said "Show me companies with more than a million Euros (which did not exist at the time) in revenue per year that use TCP/IP?"
Of course, they would have been wrong on two counts:
  1) Euros became the dominant currency of the unified Europe, a political feat that many said could never happen, [had its roots in the 20s, became serious in 80s, and was finalized in the 90s](
  2) TCP/IP did become the dominant networking protocol on the planet.
It's not yet a wildfire, just as TCP/IP wasn't a wildfire in 80s. It may never become a wildfire.

To fully understand how far away from a free market we've come consider the argument for keeping block sizes small enough for Chinese miners to process efficiently.
Those miners have gained an advantage due to low electricity costs. Good for them! But, if we don't allow market forces to adjust the electricity cost advantage as bandwidth requirements increase, there's no market at all.
Did anyone ever suggest setting a limit on watts per block so that miners in high electricity areas could stay competitive? Of course not, but that's essentially what's happening right now with bandwidth.

Ideally, everyone with a processor can be a competitive miner on a cost-per-hash basis.
For security purposes, it doesn't matter a bit how efficient the mining process is or how high the hash rate is.
All that matters is how decentralized it is, and how difficult it is to centralize it.
So, it's clear that the more people that can get involved -- using just the hardware they already have -- the better.

I'd support a plan that increased block size at a rate where the actual economic cost of running a full node would fall for some number of years until it's absurdly cheap as it was in the early days when nobody was using the network, perhaps to where it's affordable to run a full node on your mobile device using mobile bandwidth.
This would not happen overnight, might take 10 or twenty years.
But the key thing is that we need to move consistently in that direction until Bitcoin is, once again, massively distributed.
I believe there were around 100k nodes years ago, now we're down to around 6,000 -- that's pretty scary if you think about it. The good news is that believe that decline is leveling off.
Even SegWit is a step in the wrong direction, but it has the advantages of improving efficiency short, medium, and long term and fixing malleability once and for all that it's a compromise I can live with.

Digital Asset Holdings "bought" the Hyperledger team some time back.
Hyperledger itself is a cryptoledger system, written in Elixir, that uses a simplified Paxos-style consensus algorithm. The authors claimed scale to thousands of transactions a second.
I met the Hyperledger team. They're good guys and I think they made a wise decision to join DAH. I'm a bit distressed by IBM and The Linux Foundation supporting this the way they are, often describing Bitcoin as "shady" and such.
How the Linux Foundation chose to back Hyperledger is a total mystery and makes me 100% suspicious of it the Linux Foundation.

Much of your statement, and responses to others, indicate that you expect linear relationships where they don't exist.
Consider, for example, the cost of a car -vs- it's top-speed.
Most cars on the road today can go over 100 MPH. Does a car that can go 200 MPH cost twice as much?
You may be right that fee calculation is sub-optimal. I just wanted to point out that pricing is very rarely linear with capability and/or capacity.
Consider the fact that Bitcoin transactions used to be completely free, and the first time it became *necessary* to pay a fee, that was an *infinite* increase in fees paid. :-)

Do you not believe that the first miners able to use ASICBOOST did not use their advantage against the others?
And let's be clear, ASICBOOST does not boost mining efficiency, it allows you to skip doing a bunch of the work that you were expected to perform -- without anyone finding out.
Failing to report this as the cryptographic bug that it represents, patenting it and/or using it to your advantage is not a sign of integrity.
ASICBOOST is morally equivalent to checking to see if a door is unlocked and, finding it is, breaking, entering, and stealing, then claiming you did the people you stole from a favor by improving their security.

I agree it’s up to the business to decide.
That doesn’t change the fact that your argument of “need to pay the bills in fiat” isn’t an accurate reflection of how businesses operate or are likely to transition.
Once a business owner CHOOSES to accept bitcoin, the best way to do so is to accept it directly and HODL it.
The ONLY way they’d NEED to immediately convert to fiat is if: 1) they have ZERO profit margin, or 2) they are taking in more bitcoin than their margin.
In the first case, they need to raise their prices ASAP and shouldn’t be considering bitcoin.
Time has shown that the second case simply doesn’t happen. Many, many stories over the year of business WANTING to accept bitcoin and finding few-to-no takers.

Sorry, it's a complex subject, but the short answer to your question is: buying/selling other currencies could affect the price of Bitcoin as measured by those currencies.
And buying and selling Bitcoin can affect the price of Bitcoin in every other currency.
Buying and selling happen on per-exchange basis, so the prices from one exchange to another can vary substantially as we've seen recently with BFX.
When arbitrage is happening, buying from a low-priced exchanged raises the price on that exchange (by increasing demand) while selling those inexpensively acquired coins on an exchange with a higher price lowers the price on that exchange (by increasing supply).
So arbitrage drives divergent exchange prices toward parity.
Hope that helps.

Simply pointing out that no fiat currency can claim to be “stable” — just more so than Bitcoin right now.
It’s pretty obvious that Bitcoin will be more stable than fiat in the future, because of its pre-known, stable supply system and complete political neutrality.
As for exceptional events, Bitcoin has risen in value steadily since its inception, from $0 to $5000 in 9 years.
Which means that your statement is as much a cherry-pick as mine. Bitcoin has been far more likely to go up than down.

I agree with everyone else who has already told you you're over-reacting, but I'll add another twist:
Assuming Bitcoin grows and allows more people to avoid tax payment (which I'd not recommend), just as physical cash does today, government control will likely decentralize, shifting power from federal toward local.

Gold miners never had their work parameters cryptographically defined. It's designed so that different miners can compete in a trust free, verifiable manner to do a certain amount of work in a certain way.
ASICBOOST exposes a flaw in Satoshi's cryptography. If a flaw in signing was discovered and an entity patented it licensee began stealing Bitcoin from others, would you be OK with entities involved?
Calling Bitcoin block generation mining was a convenient way to describe what miners do, but don't confuse convenient similarity to familiar processes for identity.
You should also consider whether the mining industry's "anything goes to get it out of the ground" quest has resulted in positive or negative outcome. Seems to me some horrible things have been done by powerful people against less powerful people in the quest for gold acquisition, in addition to some unimaginable scaring of the surface of our planet and ecology.

It doesn't matter what the transactions are for, or who does them.
It only matters that someone is willing to pay for them.
Miners get reduced fees in proportion to their hash power, i.e. a miner with 50% of hash power would receive a 50% reduction in fees due to "paying themselves" 50% of the time.

1) Sure it's hash rate is much more directly correlated to the price, both the block reward and fees are paid in bitcoin. That fees need to *smoothly* replace the block reward as it falls off each four years...
2) You missed the point entirely here, it leads to  which you didn't understand, apologies for not being more clear. The blocks will fill, and fees will rise from zero -- they *must* as the block reward drops at halvings.
3) The first time blocks became full, many wallets and other systems became very buggy as they had never seen full blocks before. Blocks are going to fill and that needs to be no surprise to developers when it happens.
4) "work out these sorts of issues" means "figure out a solution to these types of issues", i.e. it's better to figure out a solution to full blocks now while the network is relatively small.

At some point it's simply cheap enough in your deflationary currency that you're willing to trade it. Perhaps today isn't the day for Bitcoin, but I can assure you that some folks who were mining early and/or invested at less than 1/BTC (currency is irrelevant at this scale) have traded away a few BTC to buy some things they want.

This has happened due to reputation building and mining chips catching up to modern fabrication techniques.
When Bitcoin was smaller and mining was worth less (in fiat terms) ASICs were built on then-obsolete chips fabs that are inexpensive to operate because they were paid for when they were current.
As mining ASICs reach modern fab techniques, and the price of bitcoin continues to rise (knock on wood) this "race" should slow down and allow more companies to join the fray -- particularly larger entities that have the capital -- and potentially the fabs themselves.
Imagine what the mining landscape would look like if every AMD, Intel and ARM core had a mining ASIC beside it...

Because arbitrage cannot happen smoothly


Or BTC, or fiat...but once they're out, they're out. Hard to tell what happens next.


Yes, that may happen to some extent, but the sale happens in a much larger pool with a LOT less pressure built up. The rise is happening at a few exchanges under extreme and non-arbitragable circumstances, but the fall is distributed across all the other exchanges which are freely arbitragable.
Basically, those buying BTC on BFX suddenly find themselves as big fish in a little pond -- at least relative to when it was open -- and are feeling the effects of slippage magnified.
It's all about scarcity, and BFX finds itself with too many dollars and too few BTC at the moment...

To put it another way, there are TWO axis of mining security on Bitcoin, hash power and decentralization.

The difficulty reset appears to be designed to avoid centralization by making mining unprofitable.
It's not working currently because ASIC manufacture has been sliding down the process gradient from the beginning, where it started far-behind modern manufacturing capabilities to the present where it is pulling up to modern manufacturing capabilities.
Ideally, and hopefully eventually, mining will return to a true decentralization.
Short of that, it's just a matter of time before BIG MONEY comes in and wipes out the current group of miners.
This might happen first by large technology firms (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple) getting involved, then internal banks, and finally governments.
That won't happen until there's widespread capitulation that Bitcoin is unstoppable.

Yes, apologize for the joke, HODL does mean hold.
My point is that you will have a lot of time before this happens. Bitcoin is in beta (0.12) so users must be clear that it's not 100% read for prime time, and take responsibility for keeping their ear to ground.
Should a contentious fork occur, there will be guides as to how to proceed. It'll be a big deal, it will take months and months to sort through, but "the event" will be swift and we, and the system, will need to adjust carefully.

I'm not talking about marketing, I'm talking about a simple "Hey, we hear you, we're concerned about large blocks but understand your concerns about congestion, so we'll raise it a little and see how it goes.
The only thing I don't like about that approach is that I'd like to know what happens when we get some congestion.
The SPAM attacks last year were super valuable in that they made wallet vendors deal with fee fluctuations and we learned some things about how the market operates.
What does it look like when we get constrained for real? Without holding the block size steady, we'll never really know, so we'll have endless speculation with any facts to point to.

They won't be this way forever.
In fact, they're not in void at the moment.

Preach it.
Mining was designed to be at-cost, the "profit" coming from validating transactions yourself.

@_date: 2017-04-08 02:51:03
I don't speak for Core, but I'll explain it as I understand it.
It's very simple: Bitcoin's greatest strength is in its decentralized nature from which stems its greatest utilities: permissionless operation, freedom from censorship, non-confiscatability, etc.
Node count is at or near an all-time low. This must be resisted. The largest impediments to running a node are the storage cost of the blockchain, and the bandwidth cost of keeping the node up to date and delivering blocks to other nodes.
Larger blocks will make it more expensive to run your own node, which will further reduce node count. This puts the fundamental qualities of Bitcoin in jeopardy.
So, rather than merely increasing the block size, SegWit solves a major bug known as malleability, massively lowers the computational cost of verifying large transactions (where a simple blocksize increase would raise the computational cost QUADRATICALLY), lays the groundwork to make transactions substantially more efficient in the future, and offers incentives to reduce the UTXO set which is presently a secondary node cost but which, if left unchecked, could become the primary cost in short order.
Perhaps most importantly it also paves the way for Lightning Network, which should allow for massive transaction counts without altering the fundamental nature of THE blockchain.
So, core is not about increasing blocksize, as SegWit does that. They're against anything that would compromise the fundamental nature of Bitcoin.
I suspect they will increase the blocksize at a rate BELOW technological change to make it easier to run your own node, perhaps to the point where there will be no need for SPV wallets and such, over a long period of time.

The costs of attempting to secure against these backs are born by everyone. And these hacks will continue to occur so long as it's required to transmit enough information to perform a transaction to somebody else.
Then there is inflation, which is a tax on everyone and a benefit to those closest to money creation.
As for identification required at exchanges, this isn't a Bitcoin problem, it's a fiat problem: regulations imposed upon exchanges required to obtain a license.
But that's OK, there are other ways to obtain bitcoin: working or selling non-fiat assets for it.
There is also continuous work being done to make Bitcoin transactions less traceable and more anonymous. Check out mixing solutions, for instance. Cryptographic techniques exist to allow completely private transactions, and will eventually be included in the protocol.
The earliest adopters were able to obtain their Bitcoin with the least amount of identification, and miners can still remain completely anonymous. There's a lesson to be learned there...
As a beginner, you've accidentally wandered into what's known as the block-size debate.
Bitcoin is currently limited in capacity due to an apparent majority who want to make keeping the blockchain economically manageable. While your current computer may not have enough space, your next computer certainly will -- if block chain size grows less quickly than personal storage capacity grows, it'll never become a problem.
Google "Bitcoin Lightning Network" to learn how Bitcoin can be made to scale beyond the world's current transaction rates with manageable increases in the growth of the blockchain.

You’re right about the circulating supply, but that makes the halvings even more significant as the circulating supply is lower than either total supply, mined supply, or mined-but-not-lost supply.
The most fascinating aspect of Bitcoin price-action to me is how much day-trading appears to be occuring.
It’s as if a small group of people are constantly trying to skin each other for pennies, whereas HODLers are patient enough to lock up a large portion and wait for other wealthy, patient but risk-averse buyers to eventually enter the market.

Very risk-averse entities know that in order to minimize risk you must diversify.
Most investors think of diversification from the perspective of sector allocation.  
But there’s another dimension of diversification: risk allocation.
It’s ultra-risky to only be invested in incredibly low risk investments because you always miss out of big gains.
It makes sense to keep a small portion of assets in risky endeavors, and increasingly larger allocations into increasingly less risky investments.
Think of it as risk cost averaging.

See response to other post.
I’m not arguing that Bitcoin is on the cusp of widespread usage, nor that the Yellow Vests are on the cusp of overthrowing the government.
But they both appear to be gaining strength.
There was a time in the past, before the 90’s (when most people suddenly realized the internet was huge) when a small number of people understood the potential and built the internet.
I wasn’t involved until the late 80’s but it was still a very small group of people. I would talk to people about it and they reached the same conclusion you have about Bitcoin: nobody needs it, nobody wants it. WRONG!
A broken clock is right twice a day. My clock may be broken. I get that.
But your argument is, basically, it won’t happen because it hasn’t already happened.
My argument is simply that it IS happening, just very early. A catalyst will come, not sure what that might be. For the internet, it took AOL to blanket the world in free CDs to join a service that wasn’t the internet. These things are super hard to predict.
But it’s easy to see that Bitcoin is the best money ever, and for a technologist, it’s easy to see that the current system is hopelessly inefficient and unsustainable in multiple dimensions.
Someone, perhaps me, will build something that everyone wants with Bitcoin that cannot be built without it. Wait for it.

I think you misunderstand the term fungibility.
While it's possible that the history of coins could affect fungibility, I don't remember any examples of people not considering the value of all Bitcoin to be equal, except in the case of minor numismatic differences such as early blocks and Coinbase coins.
Fungibility doesn't require all coins to be indistinguishable from each other, only that they're "all" perceived to be of equal value.
Do keep in mind that fiat currency bills are all bear serial numbers, and they ATM machines are other cash handling system can and no doubt have been or will track those serial numbers.

This is a terrific post!
I agree �� and will use this “currency is in use when being held.”
The idea that store of value and medium of exchange have individual characteristics is a huge logical falacy IMHO.
Bitcoin has been the best store of value and unit of account since it was introduced. With Lightning Network, it’s now the best unit of exchange as well.
Granted, during this early period of development and adoption, it’s direct utility as such has been a greatly hindered by market price discovery and low network effect. It’s impossible to bootstrap a new non-fiat currency without overcoming these enormous obstacles, yet Bitcoin has made steady progress!
The floor price has risen steadily as more and more people see the truth.
It’s always possible that Bitcoin will fail for a variety of reasons.  It I deeply believe that it is characteristically the best money ever and has a very bright future once fiat believers capitulate to the new Bitcoin reality.

No. It’s a measure of an increase in monetary supply.
It has recently been incorrectly used to describe purchasing power over time.
Some break the word into two parts: price inflation (what you’re describing) and monetary inflation (which I’m describing).
Over time, monetary inflation often results in price inflation, particularly when monetary inflation increases faster than the economy grows.

As long as the cost to store it doesn't increase, it'll never be too big to handle -- and that's possible so long as the cost of storage declines more rapidly than the size increases.

What are you trying to understand?
@_date: 2019-01-29 02:40:01




That’s the revisionist history definition, which is why I described it as incorrect.
[Word Origin and History for inflation
Monetary sense of "enlargement of prices" **(originally by an increase in the amount of money in circulation)** first recorded 1838 in American English.](
Far easier to blame rising prices on governments and business people when you redefine the word to mean the effect, rather than the cause.
And far easier to make people believe you’re doing them a favor by “loaning” them money rather than bonding them into indentured servitude by handling them newly created, worthless paper.
Newspeak at its finest!


Which means it has less and less monetary inflation over time, not none.
@_date: 2019-01-23 03:37:12
There’s nothing required to implement it, markets either will or won’t regardless of your concerns.
I don’t need to worry about how countries were effected by the Euro transition, because this won’t be planned, cannot be controlled, and the chips will fall.
I don’t need to worry about inflation, because Bitcoin’s monetary policy is fixed. Once again, market forces WILL decide, without any coordination.
Neither is static supply a concern, as Bitcoin is simply and perfectly divisible.
You’re so used to central planning, you think it’s required and cannot imagine a world without it.
I can imagine a world without it. I believe it’ll be fine. I could be wrong, you could be right, but it’s far more likely we’re both a bit wrong and bit right.
But the bottom line is this: nobody can control Bitcoin. If your concerns are about who and how it should be controlled, you’re not even thinking about the right set of problems.

Bitcoin isn’t the first, and also isn’t a business.
Bitcoin has the best development by far. No contest in my opinion.
Bitcoin has recently been gaining market share.
The only reason it’s lost it is due to newbies hoping to find “the next Bitcoin” which isn’t going to happen.


The hell there wasn’t. Many companies and many technologies, and many “worldwide” networks.


You cannot equate addresses with people.
Exchanges and cold storage companies may have huge addresses but the coins are not legally theirs.


Wallets, or addresses? Not even remotely the same thing.
A percentage almost certainly headed higher as more people adopt the best money ever.


Accumulated bitcoin doesn’t give you control of Bitcoin.
Ask the SegWit 2x and Bitcoin Cash folks how that belief plays out.


I’m not sure that’s the case. Fiat money is generally NOT held by the wealthy, it’s the money of the poor.


 Ecause it is.
Soundness is orthogonal to distribution, and nobody has ever touted Bitcoin to be non-volatile at this early stage of its development.


There’s a big difference between uneven distribution and control. Nobody that I know of has ever claimed Bitcoin would result in communal wealth distribution. ��‍♂️


The soundness of a money has to do with supply, not volatility.


The difference from today is the difference between a world of moneys under continuous political manipulation and  Cantillion Effect.
A world with a single currency and no Cantillion Effect.

Not everyone needs to keep the full chain, but even for those that do it's literally pennies on the dollar compared to inflation.


This is wrong. Bitcoin is capped-supply currency, designed, maintained and improved by everyone who uses it. As such it is free of national political agendas. Anyone can choose to opt-out of the traditional system at any time, in part or in whole. As such it is the solution.


Bitcoin has never been more appealing than it is today, in my opinion.

Bitcoin could crash to zero, but it would essentially require a technical fault of some sort that couldn't be corrected in a reasonable manner.
The price won't go to zero because of purely human factors, including governmental action. It has unique utility and will continue to useful to somebody, somewhere.
After all, even tulips didn't go to zero! ��
That said, its price could drop dramatically if governments started getting very pesky. Yet I suspect if they make it fully illegal, its price can still be far higher than it was at peak.

Several current trends, from increasingly inexpensive solar, to decreasingly likely semiconductor process size improvements, to decreasing cost of running a full node, all conspire to move Bitcoin closer to the model that you, I and the Bitcoin Core team supports.
Which is to say, you're not alone and far more than a single person are addressing it.
That said, it's implicit that an issue that a single person cannot address is an issue that many single people need to address individually.
That's why I run a node that has no direct economic benefit top me and is, in fact, costs $50ish/month: because Bitcoin as-a-whole is worth far more to me than $50ish/month for many reasons, some direct and some indirect.
When the cost of running a full node becomes negligible, and every processor has a tiny SHA256 miner built in, OSes might choose to autostart a Bitcoin node the way they choose to autostart NTP, DNS, etc.

Bitcoin requires no trust — except perhaps in mathematics.
Many people used to say it requires trust in code, or the coders. This is, perhaps, slightly true for those who cannot code.
But it’s super important to understand that the network upgrades slowly. So even if a bug is introduced, it’s not critical to the network until more than half the nodes are running the buggy version.
This can, and has recently, happened(!).
But given the large, and growing, number of developers taking interest, and the crazy-great process that core uses, it should be less and less likely over time.

There is no "mempool" as each node keeps its own mempool independently.
Depending on the settings of the node you're looking at, it's highly likely you're seeing a node with fees so low that they'll never get confirmed.
With continuous reports of transactions being confirmed in 1-3 blocks at 5 satoshi/byte and SegWit usage increasing steadily, it certain appears to me that big block proponents' claims that SegWit would not solve the fee problem were wrong.

The reason people think it will centralize is that each hub need to be able to commit as much BTC as each of its channel peers commit for the length of the channel.
So, if a peer wants to open a 1 BTC channel with another peer, the other peer must have 1 BTC to commit to the channel for the expected duration of the channel -- and be willing to do so for the benefit of fees, which will certainly not be zero.
I'm a big supporter of ⚡️ but it will, IMHO, become partially centralized just as Core is concerned the main would with large blocks.

That's exactly how it works if OP wants to keep things simple.
It's not likely that there'll be a massive influx of Bitcoin business as Bitcoin has very low penetration at this point.
Wallets keep track of payments, and an accountant knows how to handle multiple currencies.

I would love to tell you it's safe. I have great confidence in its safety, but it's clearly more risky than traditional investments in some ways.
Of course, I'd be remiss to not mention that risk and reward are proportional -- the higher the risk, the higher the reward.
I have great confidence because I believe the market is overstating the risks and understating the rewards.
I think you'll find most people on this subreddit are largely aligned with that thinking.
One risk of bitcoin is that it's a bearer asset. If your bitcoin are stolen, they're gone and are basically unrecoverable. So, if you plan to invest a significant amount of value, you should **absolutely** use a hardware wallet to safeguard your funds.
The Bitcoin network replaces nearly all the basically functionality of the banking system, cutting out the middlemen who seek rent on your money flow.
One of the services they provide is safe-keeping your money (aside from inflation, which is systemic theft, but that's another subject) so you must take great care to safeguard your bitcoin.
On the flip side, consider this fact: by most measures, there are likely more millionaires in the world than there are bitcoin in existence today and likely more millionaires than bitcoin will ever exist (21 million).
That means that should every millionaire in the world spend all of their vast amounts of money to acquire Bitcoin, **they could not acquire an entire Bitcoin each.**
But today, you can own an entire bitcoin for $5,500, or any portion of a bitcoin for proportionally less, i.e. a half a bitcoin for $2,750.
Let that sink in for a minute.

The block rate has been low due to miner gaming of BCH EDA.

It's price, combined with liquidity, allows Bitcoin to be used for a segment of purchases worldwide.
The lower the price, the fewer lower-value transactions it can handle.
The higher the price, the more high-value transactions it can handle, as well as the lower value transactions underneath it, to the lower limit of fee viability (outside of Lightning Network, of course).
When Bitcoin was worth $5/BTC, it would require all the Bitcoin there ever will be (complete liquidity) to perform a $105M transaction.
At $10k, that same transaction can be handled by 10,500 Bitcoin (far lower liquidity required).

Imagine your browser has a wallet built in.
You put $5 in once in a while. You tell it what you're willing to pay without being bothered. It'll ask above that.
Websites can use the ancient 402 Payment Required status to signal that bitcoin of a certain amount must be sent to a certain address before you can view the page.
If the amount is less than your bother level, it just happens.
If the amount is more, your browser asks for confirmation.
This cuts out the need for advertising and paywalls.
Content creators can now be paid directly by those enjoying their content.

As I understand it, the only way to open a channel requires committing fees, and channels are the ONLY way to communicate with and between hubs.
Therefore, every hub must commit funds.

Lightning network, as I understand it, has zero potential of theft of payment.

No, you can never lose spent coin due to non-confirmation.

Is every successful outcome for a VC investor a bubble?
I’m 100% confident that Facebook stock had periods of growth far higher than bitcoin valuations this year.
Bubbles can ONLY be spotted after the fact, once it becomes clear that the asset did not have the value to support its price.
Bitcoin has been accused of being in a bubble continuously since 2011.
The difference is that more and more people who look at Bitcoin rationally see that this isn’t a bubble, it’s explosive value creation — just like a “unicorn” VC investment.

I set one up today.
It's a Mac mini (Mid 2011), 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB 1333 MHz DDR3, 256 GB SSD.
It's on WiFi but gets 250 Mb/sec download, 30 Mb/sec upload speed.
I installed Mac OS X High Sierra from scratch and downloaded Core 0.15.0.1 from bitcoin.org.
It took about 11 hours to synchronize and is now a full peer on the network, signaling /Satoshi:0.15.0.1(NO2X)/ as the UA comment.

It's a vanity address. Nobody has the private keys, so it's not his address.


No, you can set the amount to zero. Unless you mean extra fees because the transaction is larger, which is why this is an absolutely horrible plan.
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:32:40
Wallets are a series of transactions that are, essentially, "tagged" with an address.
Address re-use is frowned upon as it limits your privacy in several ways, and *potentially* reduces your security if you spend from the same address multiple times.
Each time you send bitcoin elsewhere, one or more UTXO (amounts received, but not spent) are spent, and one or more new UTXOs are created.
If you receive two bitcoin, one at a time, into a wallet, then spend 1.5, both are spent, with the 1.5 going to the recipient, and .5 returning to a brand new address in your wallet.
Hope that helps.

The second one is a fresh address in your wallet for the change portion of the input.
Bitcoin inputs are **always** composed of entire receives to an address.
Say you were sent 2 bitcoin, then later wanted to send 1 to a friend.
The 2 bitcoin received would be the input, one output would be 1 sent to your friend, and the other output would be 1 back to yourself on a new address for privacy purposes.

Because your statements assumes that you can predict when bitcoin will go up, and when bitcoin will go down.
If you sell and it goes up, you cannot buy as many as you had previously.
And please do consider the FACT that Bitcoin goes up a LOT more than it goes down.
So, every time you sell, odds are pretty good that bitcoin will continue higher and you'll end up with fewer Bitcoin.

Who gives a damn about MtGox? Surely the folks who've lost their bitcoin, and I feel terrible for them! Yet the reason so many early folks have done so very well with Bitcoin is because of the universal truth of risk -vs- reward.
Those who had BTC in MtGox were in extremely early, and were therefore taking enormous risks. For those who didn't step on a landmine -- or those who only lost a limb or two rather than their lives -- the rewards have been completely balanced against the risk they were taking being involved so very early.

Which says nothing about how well it’s applied.
We agree on nearly every point you’ve made. I was just clarifying that should Bitcoin increase in value, which we both seem to agree is likely, it’s value could be as a replacement for other things (fiat, gold, etc.) and, as such, would likely reduce their value by a similar amount to its increase.
And, again to be clear, it’s certainly possible for it to rise beyond their replacement value if it proves more valuable than they were — which I do believe.

Account orientation has absolutely led to a loss of funds when people have attempted to spend a portion of a paper wallet only to much later realize the transaction left the paper wallet empty and they had abandoned the change address because they thought the transaction spent a portion of the UTXO and Leaving the balance on the paper wallet.

With the addition of Lightning Network (⚡️) it can handle an essentially unlimited number of transactions.


Completely suitable, with sub-second confirmation times.


Incredibly less than current payment systems and Bitcoin itself, potentially sub-satoshi and/or entirely free.


Incredibly more efficient than current payment system and Bitcoin itself, also sub-satoshi.


Less than 21,000,000


On the blockchain, each Bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 individual units, each called a satoshi.
On ⚡️ each satoshi can be further divided into 1,000 milli-satoshis, though settlement on the main chain must be rounded to 1 satoshi.


That's up to the will and choices made by the node operators of the Bitcoin network, of which you're free to join and participate at any time.
Most people believe it's incredibly unlikely the majority of the node operators would ever agree to a change that would allow more coins to be created beyond the current 21,000,000 limit -- which isn't achieved for another 115 years.


Many aspects of Bitcoin, and particularly ⚡️, are quite rough-around-the-edges.
That said, Bitcoin is a long game and -- like all technologies before it -- will get easier to use over time.


In my opinion, absolutely. Much of the infrastructure required for mass adoption is already in-place and the rest is being developed.
Which is not quite to say it's mature enough at this point.


It's far more secure -- when used expertly -- than tradition systems.
For the average person today, not ready for prime time at the moment.


It's far more private -- when used expertly -- than traditional systems.
For the average person today, probably not at the moment.


Whether we need it or want it, many cryptographic techniques are on the horizon that will make it so.


The more you know about it and understand it, the more you trust it.


The software system is incredibly stable.
It's value is far from stable, but it's stability is growing over time.
I strongly believe that if it continues to grow and reach les toward mass adoption, it could become more stable that existing systems.

I do completely understand what you've described. I don't believe that outcome is likely, but nobody has a crystal ball, so there's no point in arguing. :-)
The reason I think it's unlikely is that to use Bitcoin requires bitcoin. All of the use cases for Bitcoin, currency, store-of value, asset-transfer, etc. require holding some amount of bitcoin, and some of the more interesting uses, such as invested identity, require Bitcoin destruction.
So, I'm in the binary outcome camp: zero or moon. I'm currently optimistic, but probably in the 1/3 moon, 2/3 moon range. :-)

It's a fine point, but there is an argument to suggest it's not inflation, per se.
The general term inflation has always been used to describe an essentially open-ended process of fiat money creation.
Precious metals, on the other hand, were felt to exist in a fixed supply (all that there is on Earth) with mining making more available on a regular basis, *but essentially fixed in quantity at some unknown point in the future*. So less open-ended than fiat money creation.
Bitcoin is a different beast entirely. We *know* there will eventually be 21M bitcoin. Like the precious metal supply, mining makes more available on a regular basis, but unlike fiat or precious metals, *we already know the total number, and when the coins will enter circulation*.
Since the schedule and end-game are already known, and the only possible deviation from that plan involves reductions in the total supply via private-key loss and intentional burning for identity value, it's not unreasonable to describe Bitcoin as a deflationary currency.
Either way, 3,600 new coins enter circulation every day until sometime next year, then 1,800 after that. We're going to learn a lot at that point. :-)

I thought we agreed that the future of economics (of everything really. Nobody believes in crystal balls, right?) was chaotic and unpredictable?
If so, everything you know about how economics are believed to work currently, and/or is "known" to work in a matter that is well approximated by the current world-view, doesn't really matter all that much.
In such a case (which is common to about 99.99% of all cases) it's more valuable to know how something is working right now than how it has worked in the past.
Consider the case of Newton and Einstein.
Newton is widely heralded as being amongst the world's greatest geniuses in large part for his creation of a mathematical model of gravitation -- despite having been shown quite conclusively by Einstein that his model was, alas, only an approximately and not, in fact, the correct model.
Which is to say that current economic models may be proven quite conclusively by Bitcoin to have been, alas, only an approximately and not, in fact, the correct model.
For the entire history of Bitcoin, economists have been continuously in wrong in their predictions of Bitcoin.
Another group of people, largely consisting of cypherpunks, general technologists and Austrian school economists, have been continuously right in their predictions of Bitcoin.
So what gives a mainstream economist the confidence to come in here and try to educate us about economics during the Bitcoin era?
Guys just like you have been coming in here and telling us that we don't know what we're talking about and being angry that we didn't take their "teachings" as gospel.
If you folks had even an ounce of humility you'd be coming in here and begging for us to educate you on why we've been right, not telling us how poorly educated we are for not believing whatever it is you think you know that we don't -- that which has led astray every single prediction your professional community has made to date!
In short, economists are the emperor who wears no clothes, and we're the kids explaining to everyone that you're buck naked. ��‍♂️

No, difficulty adjusts every 2088 blocks which should be around 2 weeks but is generally less as hash power is being added constantly in-between adjustments.
It does not adjust by a fixed amount. The more hash power that was added, the most difficulty increases. This is the mechanism that keeps block times near 10 minutes even as hash power increases.
In the last 39 days difficulty has increased by:

Inflation means the money supply is increased. While frequently correlated with rising prices, so is demand...
Deflation is the exact opposite of that.
Bitcoin is currently inflationary, but the price is rising due to explosive demand.
With many assets, when demand increases, supply increases are inevitable.
Bitcoin’s supply is nearly completely inelastic with price increases.

    3) It's clear as a HODLer that the only vendors who take Bitcoin are HODLers too.
Having been here for 5 years, it's believe it's clear that spending increases dramatically as the price increases, and I seriously doubt that there's any way to change anyone's behavior by encouraging spending as it's been tried by many people over the years and it simply never works. ��

To be clear, I'm no expert on the subject, and not qualified in any way to give advice on this issue, so feel free to take this with a grain of salt.
It *appears* to be OK for US employers to pay US employees in other currencies as long as all accounting is done with accurate conversion to USD and all employer collected taxes are withheld and paid in USD.
In a fascinating twist, it's [not legal to pay employees in USD coinage that is valued above face value](
In that example, the employer and employees agreed to very low pay in USD in form of USD coins of silver and gold. This was done to pay less or no taxes. As an example, imagine working for USD $20/month in the form of a historical $20 gold coin currently worth thousands of dollars.

By long term, I meant HODLing some of their reward.
No, miners don’t all sell all of their rewards to pay bills.


No, the nodes validate that they’ve properly constructed it to the rules the nodes enforce.
Many miners thes days don’t even run a node of their own, and nodes reject bad blocks on a regular basis.


They don’t need to wait, they can validate their own transaction, but many don’t even do that, instead using a pool and/or do “SPV mining” which occasionally causes miners to mine atop an invalid block.
In Bitcoin, there are very few absolutes, yet you seem to believe there’s only one way to do mining. Interesting!

Sure, but that's essentially a fork, not normal operation.
Thanks for adding that nuance.
My point was that you only need one miner to mine your transaction, and which miner mines a block is random, scaled by hash power.
So, if a single miner controlled 51%, you'd still have a 49% chance of your transaction being mined by another miner. You may need to wait a while, but it would eventually happen, short of the very nasty scenario you pointed out.

I wouldn’t pay it either, but I wouldn’t presume to live in the shoes of someone who **needs** a Bitcoin ATM.
Bitcoin has taught me many things, but the most important is that the distinctions between currency, store of value, units of account, products, services, etc. are all fluid and largely arbitrary.
There’s human ingenuity, and a whole bunch of other things we trade for it. Don’t believe for a minute that there’s a good reason to pay different markups on different things — the market handles all of that for us.
If you or OP needs a Bitcoin ATM and can find a cheaper Bitcoin ATM then by all means use it. Otherwise, the market has set the price and you pay for what you need.

There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of such articles.
It all comes down to how many individuals are able to run a full node. The more data in the blockchain, the more bandwidth, processing power, and disk space are required to run a node.

You can print a QR code and let people scan, with two caveats:
1) You’ll sacrifice privacy: your customers, in fact anyone who can see the QR code, will know how much was sent to that address and can follow it in the future.
2) You should never spend from an address more than once. There’s a technical, but not not currently exploitable, leak of information private key details that you’re better off avoiding.
You should NEVER assume that any address that has been used in the past can be reused in the future. This is slightly off-topic, but it seems like info you should know given the questions you’re asking.

If every millionaire in the world spent all of their money on Bitcoin, they could not each own a single Bitcoin each.
All money is subject to network effects. The more people that want it, the more people want it.
Bitcoin is, besides current network size, far better money than any other — though this is debatable.
From my perspective, everyone will prefer Bitcoin when they realize it keeps going up if you’re patient — whereas every other form of money goes down due to inflation.
These three qualities make exponential growth possible.

Wow, where did that come from?
Previously, the closest you could get to investing in a technology was to invest in an entity using the technology. The value of an entity (at a moment in time) is the sum of profits the market expects it to earn in the future, discounted for risk and inflation. Which is less than the value the entity's customers believe it to be worth, i.e. are willing to pay it.
Keep in mind that monopolies on technology are few and far between, so at best a single entity can only capture a portion, of a portion of the total value. Investors can invest is baskets of entities, but that tends to reduce volatility as the basket firms battle it out in the zero-sum game of competing against one another.
Bitcoin's value (at a moment in time) is the value any entity that wants it is willing to pay for it. If you hold it, and people value it higher in the future, you get 100% of that valuation lift. And if it goes down, you get 100% of the downside as well.
Those are two very different propositions, and I do believe supports my idea that Bitcoin is a very unique value proposition, as it derives this quality from being the first DAC.

Bitcoin does not have accounts. Addresses are sort of like addresses, but exactly.
Bitcoin transactions MUST spend individual amount received (UTXO) at an address, not any portion of the “balance” of an address.
Also, addresses can receive multiple amounts, but should only be spent from once, The the remainder sent to another address (change address).
It’s a subtle difference but key to understanding the structure and operation of Bitcoin.
Transaction fees are the solution to your concern, as others have pointed out.

The halving is scheduled to happen every 210,000 blocks — about four years’ worth of perfect 10 minute average blocks.
The halving refers to the block reward being halved: for the first 210,000 blocks 50 bitcoin were created every block, then 25 for the next 210,000, currently 12.5 for the next 678 days.

You've *never* followed a link, got a paywall, and walked away frustrated.
The existing payment infrastructure (in the US) typically costs $.30 + 3% and requires (or incentivizes via reduced fees) address, expiration date, and CVV2 entry.
The old system is several decades behind modern technology. If you think it's adequate, it's likely you've never tried to do anything creative with it or write code against it.
It's such a steaming pile of crap that you cannot reasonably automate transaction reconciliation with it. Some gateway vendors may provide a way to do so, but the vast majority cannot tell you which individual transactions are included in a batch of money sent to your bank account.
Compared to Bitcoin, the existing financial system is two cans connected with a string. It's that bad.

This is a market. Difficulty rises constantly. Where is the evidence that miners are about to stop securing the chain?
If one leaves, two more will take their place. Particularly so if Bitcoin remains inexpensive, and popular, increasing value.

The biggest "change" would be a huge increase in the number of people who could **easily** participate by investing in BTC -- though I'm with that it's nowhere near the **optimal** way to participate.
Assuming his worst-case "Bernie Madoff" scenario doesn't play out it could be a very simple way for people to benefit from BTC as an invest in their tax-deferred retirement accounts.
The effect on the price of bitcoin could be incredibly dramatic if the ETF actually purchases and secures BTC for their clients. There's an incredibly large amount of value available for investment in these plans -- oddly I could not manage to coax Google into locating a site that estimated the amount.

This is entirely wrong.
The quantity of Bitcoin is shrinking by design, but this does NOT mean the block subsidy is shrinking by design!
block subsidy = quantity • value
Limiting the utility of Bitcoin (limiting transactions via limited block size) may well reduce demand, in turn lowering value, and thus limiting block reward value.
Would anyone be concerned about miner compensation at $1k, $10k, $100k? The answer, of course, is that it depends on when the value rises to those levels.

Who are they?
If you say "the government", which one?
If you say "the US government" they will likely run afoul of the constitution. Using bitcoin involves nothing more than signing a document (transaction) and publishing it. The constitution guarantees free speech...
The government is made up of individuals who have the same motivations as everyone else. If an individual can get wealthy by making a decision, they frequently will.
Since Bitcoin can be held anonymously, public officials will be highly motivated to get some and encourage it's growth -- making themselves, their friends and family, and their donors wealthy.
Before you say "it can't happen that way" consider US prohibition attempts on alcohol, marijuana, prostitution, driving over 55 mph, and "file sharing" -- all of which were complete failures.
And even if the US and every other nation managed to align together and ban it at a time when nearly every nation-state in the world besides the U.S. is increasingly wishing the USD was no longer the "global reserve currency", there's still enormous growth possible in the quasi-legal  [System D]( market.
Bitcoin, in fact, appears to grow fastest in economies where the state has the most reason to ban it.
While it's true that worldwide government support of Bitcoin would be the clearest and fastest path to high valuations, and it's also true that it won't happen, bitcoin has a nearly unlimited number of paths to success of various durations.
At the end of the day, the people call the shots. Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as what it is: the best money ever created. If you think the government can permanently dissuade people to use worse money then you should absolutely not hold it.

Economics is a very soft science, much like psychology and sociology.
If you don’t know that, you don’t know much about economics.
It’s clear that the system of the world economy is chaotic.
As such, making predictions about how Bitcoin will change that system — and stating a prediction as factual — is ridiculous for both pro and con viewpoints.
Bitcoin changes everything. You cannot predict the precise outcome of a chaotic system even given small changes, and Bitcoin is not a small change — it’s a completely new kind of money which no previous form of money is remotely similar to.
Which is not to say it will succeed, but is to say that no amount of education on economics gives you a substantial ability to predict its impact on the world economy.
In fact, given how incredibly wrong classically educated economists have been COMPLETELY WRONG about  it to this point it looks increasingly likely that your education is an impediment to understanding it.

Please think about the misinformation you're spreading in a statement like that. Consider the case of data loss, i.e. something extreme happens and your transactions are lost. They're gone forever, and that's not even close to "as good as" if they were written directly to the blockchain.
Eventual consistency does not imply potential conflicts -- though that's certainly a common characteristic of eventually consistent systems -- it simply implies eventually consistent behavior. Consider the case of an atomic add such as Amazon's DynamoDB provides: it has zero conflict contexts, yet remains eventually consistent in that a read cannot be expected to return the sum of all previous adds, only those outside the window of inconsistency.

Bitcoin has never had accounts, regardless of how some of “we” may have mislead ourselves into thinking so.
The whitepaper doesn’t contain the word “account.”


Bitcoin DOES NOT handle transactions of arbitrary amounts between addresses or “(accounts)”.
Bitcoin transactions transactions ONLY consumes input UTXO(s) **in their entirety** and create one or more UTXO(s) identified and controlled by an address cryptographically bound to one or more recipient’s public key(s).
All concept of account in Bitcoin is a figment of someone’s imagination.

It does several things:
  1) It enforces the rules of that software that you run
  2) It enlarges the peer-to-peer network. This increases network resilience, increases capacity for light wallets, and lowers the burden on existing nodes when new nodes come online as nodes distribute the blockchain to each other.
Perhaps most importantly, it allows you to operate on the network (via the built-in wallet) in a first class, zero trust manner.

Reading the previously written data.
The point is that while LN "bundles" many smaller transactions into fewer blockchain transactions (which is a bit like a write cache) a true write cache is integrated with the read mechanism (potentially also cached) and improves performance WITHOUT changing semantics.
LN is scalability through distribution and eventual consistency, not caching.

No, that's incorrect, never 100%.
After all, the output address(es) are not witness data, but are fundamental to the transaction.
I believe a transaction that consolidates many UTXOs into a single UTXO is the highest witness/non-witness ratio, and it'll never be 100%.
@_date: 2015-09-09 00:44:36
a huge difference is that reads are consistent with the write-caching filesystem, i.e. when reads are issued against the file that is being written to, the expected results will be returned.
That would not be the case with LN, which, I think, makes it a bit disingenuous to describe it as a write cache for Bitcoin, particularly when telling others THEY need a CS background to understand it...

How about being able to buy something physical or digital, or the time of someone in another political jurisdiction with ZERO friction: no conversion rates, no delays, no paperwork, etc.
How about your car being able to pay for the gas put into, and the burger and coke you picked up inside the store?
How about being able to go to grocery store, fill your cart up with stuff, and pay at the door after the RFID scanners tally everything in the cart instantly and perfectly every time?
How about being able to tip anyone who made your day better by posting a beautiful photo, humor, wisdom, knowledge, music, simply, easily and directly?

Agreed, that is synchronization and it's handled by the nodes, not miners.
Miners broadcast new blocks via a different mechanism, submitBlock.


In the long term, if they're smart. BCH showed this quite clearly and does so today. There are periods when BCH is more profitable to mine, but most miners don't bother switching during those times.
And no, they don't pay themselves. The protocol that the nodes validate allow miners to be paid the block reward. We appreciate their work, but they work for us.

The value will increase in an S curve as first desire, and second adoption increase.
Once it’s widely adopted, the value of other things will be measured against it, rather than vice-versa today.
Since Bitcoin has little-to-no non-monetary value (other than timestamping and proof-of-existence which, while huge, is probably lower than industrial + jewelry usage for gold) and a pre-known and largely fixed creation rate it will be far more  stable than gold.

Yes, absolutely.
I think it’s safe to say the vast majority of transactions are mined this  way.
My point is that a miner can mine a transaction that was never broadcast.
On a separate note: there is no “mempool.” Each node maintains there own mempool and there’s absolutely NO reason to believe each node has an identical mempool. It’s tremendously detrimental to think in terms of a single, global mempool, for all but the highest level discussion of how Bitcoin operates.

No, it is up to you to prove that a Bitcoin cannot be used as a currency because a currency requires stability to be useful.
No currency is stable. No prices are stable. Everything fluctuates, and as we've seen since 2008, traditional measures to alter the value -- interest rate adjustment -- has proven to be ineffective.
And, I'll repeat, the GBP's volatility should, by your measure, be useless as a currency. Same with the Yuan, Euro, Yen, Ruble, and USD.

To suggest that fiat is "designed" to be stable -- at a time when nearly all fiat currencies worldwide are being simultaneously inflated because, we're told, geometric growth of money supply (2% inflation per year) is ideal, is absolutely ridiculous.
And to suggest that Bitcoiners know less about the properties of money than non-Bitcoiners is also absolutely ridiculous.
All you're doing here is regurgitating the things you've been taught. Have you ever considered the possibility that what you've been taught is incorrect?
For instance, how do you suggest that fiat currency is designed for stability when GBP is currently unstable? How do you explain the fact that nearly every commodity is several times more expensive today than 40 years ago -- even though there have been MASSIVE efficiency gains in nearly all human endeavors due to computerization and automation during that same timeframe?

Your “basic explanation” is terribly misleading.
Double-entry ccounts are nearly universally maitained long term, are generally repeatedly spent from, can be spent from in any amount, and are intended to track flow and balance available for a specific purpose.
Addresses are generally single-receive/single-spend, should only be spent from once, and typically are spent in the entire amount received — though “change” outputs allow only a portion to be sent to another party.
Bitcoin should never be described as account-based rather than UTXO and/or transaction based as it’s NOT account based.
To do so impairs the student’s ability to reason about its properties and fundamentally misleads them into misunderstandings that will result in security leaks, privacy leaks, misinforming others, and losing coins (spending from a paper wallet, for instance).
To the extent you feel compelled to mislead newbies by conflating the familiar concept of double-entry accounts with Bitcoin’s UTXO and address model, I humbly suggest that, at a minimum, you drop a hint that addresses “have similarities to” accounts, or some such language.
Not doing so is misleading the student, no matter how well intended the deception. ��
UTXOs are the fundamental underpinnings of Bitcoin. The sooner people grasp that, th sooner many more esoteric aspects of Bitcoin become comprehensible.

Divisibility has nothing to do with inflation, psychologically or otherwise.
Add a digit to the right (divisibility) and everybody's balance is identical relative to total.
Add one on the left (inflation) and everyone's balance is 1/10 of new total.
Increased divisibility will only be necessary if we reach a point where individual transactions need to exchange value of less than 1/100M of a bitcoin.
I doubt an optimal issuance curve is known.
My guts tell me the predictability is more important than curve.

As I understand it, the *only* thing that got Liberty Reserve into trouble was calling their currency a "Liberty Dollar".
Bitcoin is a ledger, and transactions booked into it are free speech.
It is, essentially, money 2.0 -- not Liberty Reserve 2.0.
You have no rebuttal to the fact that early investors in new technology stocks eventually make their money by selling those stocks to other investors.
Bitcoin investors stand a chance of losing the value they invest in Bitcoin. They also stand the chance to earn a lot of value by supporting it *before* it becomes widely used.
That isn't a ponzi scheme, that's a high-risk/high-reward investment scenario.
All well diversified portfolios should contain a spread of investments along the high-risk/high-reward and low-risk/low-reward spectrum.

I was trying to make the essential point semantically.
Reversed would mean a transaction had occurred and then another reversed it -- that's the age-old definition of reversal in accounting.
Replaced means that before a transaction is confirmed it is replaced -- and only if the original transaction explicitly broadcasts the fact that it allows itself to be replaced.
So, for zero confirmation transactions, opt-in RBF changes the rules from:
1) Transaction may never confirm, may be double-spent and cannot be replaced.
1) Transaction may never confirm, may be double-spent, and cannot be replaced -- identical to pre-opt-in RBF
2) Transaction may never confirm, may be double-spent, and allows replacement -- new condition
Is this really worth making incendiary accusations over?
@_date: 2015-11-19 01:27:08
Your model would work well between two individuals that transact frequently, and trade back and forth -- like within a family unit perhaps. "I bought the eggs this time."
But it breaks down when dealing with merchants. The transaction flows are one-way -- from you to merchant -- and each channel locks up liquidity.
I think the best way to think of LN is as a checking account -vs- the Bitcoin blockchain's savings account. Lots of cash flows through your checking account, but you (relatively) rarely move cash between checking and savings.

While I agree with your general premise, and believe bitcoin itself has enormous value when coupled with the Bitcoin blockchain network, it's also clear to me that blockchains in-and-of-themselves have value as well.
Namecoin, for instance.
And, when you're a large financial institution and pay the enormous costs of Oracle software, EMC appliances, and all that's associated with them, a Bitcoin independent blockchain can be valuable *to them* by reducing their expenses.
The problem, of course, is that the security of those blockchains will be terrible -- though it *might* be better than what they have (low standard) -- but given that in the US they've avoided higher security (chip and PIN) for decades, they clearly don't care about security and prefer to pass fraud expenses on to their customers.

Because they are semi-independent marketplaces.
Traders -- and their bots -- are relentlessly trying to earn profit via arbitrage and providing what's known as liquidity to the overall market.
We know that Bitcoin flows easily around the planet, with nearly zero friction -- so it's always possible to get Bitcoin where it's needed most, i.e. the price is highest.
The reverse is nowhere near as true. It's difficult to move fiat around by comparison, and that's why the exchange differences arise.
The prices have been considerably higher in China during this run up. The same was true at MtGox  at the end of 2013.
The reasons are similar, but different. MtGox was not allowing withdrawals in fiat, or perhaps only allowing withdrawal in a few. This made is very difficult to get enough Bitcoin to MtGox because you could not buy BTC cheaper elsewhere, sell it on MtGox, then withdraw fiat, rinse, and repeat.
For whatever reason it *must* be difficult to get CNY out of China because I believe all the Chinese exchanges are allowing CNY withdrawals. If it were easy to get CNY out of China right now there would be a huge opportunity to provide BTC liquidity to Chinese exchanges and make a killer spread on the arbitrage.
And then there's the fact that doing this at high volume through the fiat system may require various money transmitter licenses, etc. Either way the friction of the fiat system is responsible for the different prices.

Not necessarily, but I believe correct for SegWit as written.
But that's irrelevant: a new layer of great code does not increase technical debt, particularly for those who choose to use the new code, rather than the clearly technical-debt-ridden (quadratic hashing, malleability, ASICBOOST) old code.

There have been many posts that show that the vast majority (all?) of the functionality is available by running a few commands to install their publically available tools on on plain old Pi.
Not sure how that qualifies as squeezing...it's free...squeeze me some more.
I think most people misunderstand this as a miner.
It's not!
It allows you to pay for things via your electric bill by doing your part to strengthen the blockchain's hash rate and drive the cost of mining down while dramatically improving decentralization.
And it's this nifty little micropayment side-chain.
And it's a nifty microservice marketplace.
And, I suspect, microservice delivery platform that may put a hurt on the large cloud providers as well!
Most computers have trivial utilization -- particularly when you're not using it!
If unutilized capacity could be rented out profitably then future devices with these -- and they're no-doubt targeting a single chip design for the entire package -- could be taken home for free, enjoyed when you need them, and pay you rental income on your floor space, electricity and bandwidth.

Apologies, I answered the question you wrote, rather than the one you needed answered. :-)
You asked about moving between addresses, but now I can see you meant between wallets.
Given that mistake, you should know that very few -- if any -- wallets have a one-to-one relationship with addresses.
So be very careful, it's entirely possible that your wallet balance is spread across multiple addresses.
In the case of HD wallets, multiple addresses share a single private key. But in other cases, particularly the wallets that were around 18 months ago and earlier, they would have many private keys.

It's pretty obvious how gold works.
Who claims to not understand it?
Gold was the best form of money to a very long time. It's difficult to counterfeit, durable and relatively limited in supply. It's only real downside is transportability and while technically highly divisible that's limited in practice.
So, the only things gold is outright bad at is micro-transactions on its decided macro-scale and ability to transact at distance.
Transportability of gold is such a problem that it is single-handedly responsible for the creation of fiat currency.
Bitcoin is better than gold in every way except for a few issues:
1) lack of historical precedent
2) physical durability (think EMP and collapse of civilization)
3) dependence on advanced technology.
But these are NOT disadvantages inherent in Bitcoin, they exist only in people's minds -- which is not unimportant but proves time and again to be more malleable than anti-technology pundits always claim at the beginning of technology encroaching on their particular field of expertise.
1) is solved by the passage of time
2) and 3) are really subsets of 1) as:
gold can be destroyed by fission and fusion (though probably uneconomically) as energy density rises, and gold would be useless if civilization reverted back to a level of technology where accurate scales and rudimentary chemistry became unavailable. Also, it's increasingly clear that gold's relatively stable supply is about to be disrupted by sub-sea mining.
So, given time, it's clear (to me) that gold (and other precious metals and gems) will lose their luster (pun coincidental but recognized) just as physical mail, photographs and books are rapidly losing theirs.

Imagine dealing with someone online. You don't know where they're from, or who they are. You know they they can behave badly and then vanish into obscurity without a trace.
But what if they've burned 10 bitcoin? In doing so they've given a 10 BTC gift to bitcoin users in aggregate, and while they can still vanish without a trace, it'll cost them 10 BTC to do so, assuming they'll need to rebuild their reputation in the future.
It seems strange to spend money on reputation like this, and burning money gives people a strange feeling, but if you think about it, advertisers spend money on reputation all the time, and with Bitcoin, there are plenty of units to handle a reduction in bitcoin in circulation.

It's nearly impossible to guess, but if I were forced to wager (which nobody is, they can simply sit tight and let the market sort it out) I might wager that:
  1) If SegWit activated as-is, i.e. miners broke down and capitulated to node majority, price might increase.
  2) If BIP 148 succeeded and miners capitulated, price might increase.
  3) If BIP 148 fails, price would rumble but not change much.
  4) If Bitcoin splits with users on one side, and miners on the other, price might decrease.
The uncertainty leading up to the decision would almost certainly lower the price.

Whether Bitcoin is inflating or not is actually a bit of a philosophical question.
It's clear that the amount in circulation is increasing, but what's at question is whether they're being created or uncovered.
When I think of Bitcoin, I always think in terms of 1 Bitcoin being 1/21M in existence. From his perspective it's already deflationary: the supply is fixed at 21M and coins are being lost, so total number circulable is decreasing.
The reason that you cannot say the same thing about fiat is that there is NO upper bound on the maximum number that will ever be.

I doubt that.
The mempool has gone to zero in the last 30 days or so.
Even if we've managed to double incoming transactions -- which may be possible given the recent price rise -- twice the transactions going through *will* lower the cost to get through.
Even it *were* activated today, transactions would need to be created in SegWit format to gain any advantage, but we know that many wallets say they're ready to go, so it might not take too very long to make a dent.
And, there's ZERO reason to believe that activating SegWit says there will never be another on-chain increase.
We just need to be patient enough to be certain that network is ready for it before that change is made.

Yes, I believe this to be largely correct.
The mining is likely unprofitable. It provides built-in micro-liquidity to avoid having to load funds onto the box.
I suspect that you will soon be able to sell capacity to people providing said micro-services. So it *may* allow you to:
  1) Develop micro-services
  2) Advertise micro-services
  3) Sell micro-services
  4) Pay for the capacity to provide micro-services


I think yes, but this is all a bit hazy for now.

A bitcoin is the unit of account stored in the Bitcoin public blockchain.
There are 21,000,000 bitcoin total, which are being "mined" as incentive to participate, grow and operate the blockchain. There are currently about 15,000,000 in circulation. The remainder of 6,000,000 will take about *approximately* 125 years to enter circulation.
When the blockchain was first created, the reward was 50 bitcoin *approximately* every 10 minutes. *Approximately* every four years that incentive is reduced by half. We're currently in the second "reward era" so the reward is currently 25 bitcoin. The third reward era begins next summer.

Don't you see how ridiculous it is to try to predict the outcome of the Bitcoin economy? Nobody can predict the future because it's ultra-chaotic. There's never been anything like Bitcoin, particularly in recent times, so you cannot predict how it will work.

It's not particularly difficult to do what you want to do, though it is likely to be a bit inconvenient and, perhaps, not as much less expensive than you might hope for.
1) Get paid
2) Buy bitcoin on exchange
3) Send bitcoin to sister's address on Israeli exchange
4) Sister sells bitcoin for shekels
There are fees for 2, 3 (very minor), and 4. Sometimes they're stated explicitly, other times it's built into the exchange rate.
Combined, they may -- or may not -- approach the Western Union fees.
The *ideal* situation is for you to get paid in Bitcoin -- perhaps partially via Bitwage -- and for her to find ways to live on Bitcoin. In that case, there would only be very minor fees.

I'd recommend keeping an independent accounting of how many you received, when, and market price when you received them.
Similarly, how many you spent, when, and the market price when you spent them.
That will consolidate your records and greatly simplify tax preparation.
The market price *can* be retrieved after-the-fact, so it's technically not required. The blockchain itself records the rest, but IMO, it's highly likely that due to wallet changes and/or data loss, it's likely that you will not retain enough info to accurately and convincingly(!) recreate this after-the-fact.

My response:


Your debits and credits are reversed as cash on hand is always an asset, and debiting an asset account increases its balance while crediting decreases its balance.


Its a perfectly valid unit of account and can and should be accounted for in exactly the same manner as any other currency is accounted for when multiple currencies are held.


This idea has been debunked many times. The cost to operate Bitcoin is and will always be much lower than the cost to operate the world wide basket of currencies and stores of values once you consider mining precious metals, minting and transporting coins and paper currency, and the power requirements to operate the existing financial institutions that it obsoletes.

The techniques you're describing are generally known as sharding.
The problem is that while it would eliminate one aspect of scaling -- the limits of CPU, memory and disk within a single machine -- it doesn't solve the primary concern, the total cost of running a node, the primary limit on how many people can possibly afford to run a node.
Imagine we split the chain into 1024 shards, and each share could be efficiently run on a RasPi.
You're going to need 1024 RasPi's and all the wiring and space they require to be able to self-validate transactions.

How does an economy react with an "ideal" currency? We've certainly never had one before...
I suspect interest rates would be very high. While you might think this would slow things down, only people confident in the outcome would borrow.
And the people lending -- and with Bitcoin everyone could afford to lend something -- would have high income.
On second thought, since everyone can lend something, billions of active lenders might drive interest rates lower than the average we've grown accustomed to...
And, when someone kills it like Apple has -- and ends up making profits faster than they can spend it -- everyone else holding Bitcoin would become wealthy as well as that would make currency artificially more scarce.

The reasoning is based on two false "facts."
1) The fees cannot be shared with payees. If the fee was $1, and it was split with the payees, the pool operator would pay $.50 and each payee would pay 0.03125¢ ($0.50/1600). If either side cannot afford that, the business isn't low margin, it's already bankrupt.
2) The idea that the cheapest technology will win. The "best" technology will win, as determined by the market. The cheapest product in any market very rarely has the largest market share.
Consider, for instance, the "paper bitcoin" method described. Surely it's more costly than 0.003125¢ (or 0.00625¢) in anyone's time to do such a thing.

The first people who had telephones were those who *needed* a telephone or were enthralled by the possibilities.
If you owned a multi-location business, particularly if those locations were far apart, the telephone was essential.
Bitcoin speeds value flow as telephones sped information flow. As much potential as Bitcoin has it doesn't serve quite the IMMEDIATE need as the telephone did -- except in the area of censorship resistance.
That characteristic, however, has a negative connotation at the moment.

While you're right, and I agree that it's always ideal for people to understand that Bitcoin allows trust-free transactions, the reason that's true is because Bitcoin itself *is* trustworthy.
When you tell people who know little about money -- even those that have a lot of it -- that Bitcoin is trust-free it's raises the hair on the back of their necks.
Why? Because they trust the current system, whether they should or not, and it sounds like with Bitcoin there is no trust, which to them sounds like it's NOT trustworthy.
If everyone on the planet suddenly decided Bitcoin was trustworthy, it'll all work out just fine.
Consider the alternative -- the currency of shady criminals, thugs, thieves, drug and arms dealers.

Bitcoins do not have private keys, Bitcoin addresses have private keys.
A Bitcoin address is *a tiny bit* like a bank account -- except that ideally (for security and privacy reasons) an address should be used only twice: once for receiving coins and once for sending them.
Well designed Bitcoin wallets handle addresses use automatically.


Bitcoin can *currently* be divided into one hundred million units each. Those units are known as Satoshis.


There is a mathematical/cryptographic relationship between each address and its private key. The relationship is such that you can determine the public address given the private key, *but not the other way around*.
Technically speaking, it's not impossible to counterfeit a private key -- just [unimaginably unlikely]( given a sufficiently unpredictable pseudo-random number generator.

It makes it worthless when comparing how Bitcoin will work in the future. Chaos is chaos! Change one little thing, and the result is exceedingly difficult and/or impossible to predict.


My point is the fiat currencies are exceptionally unreliable over the long term and punish the steal from the poor at the expense of the wealthy, since poor people always hold more cash as a percentage of their total wealth than the wealthy do...


Prove it.


My point is that when fiat currencies are manipulated at-will, nobody is accountable in proportion to the massive scale of disruption that can be caused.


Prove it.
And please don't conflate the volatility of Bitcoin with the volatility of the economy as a whole -- they're NOT the same thing.


Try to control and economy and predict the outcome. Perhaps you'll be the first to get it right...


Yeah, number one performing currency every year since it's had a value, except one, where it was the worst performing.
Gee, I *really* wish it was more stable.


We'll never agree on this.


I agree it's intentional, I disagree it's indicative of a healthy and growing economy.
I also don't agree with measuring inflation by measuring the cost of things, which is continually adjusted via supply and demand.
They should simply report of the exact amount of new money being created, as that's the true measure of inflation.
While price of goods and money creation have a relationship, it's a tragedy and/or travesty that they're taught, reported on, and commonly used indiscriminately.
Consider the common argument for continuously devaluing the currency that it's important to have a stable price for a bottle of milk. Given supply and demand, that simply isn't possible. This is often expressed with the connotation of allowing poor people to be able to afford the things that they need. But if that's what you're after, the ideal situation would be to drive the cost of these items as low as possible, which is what would happen with Bitcoin or any other super-low to fix-supply currency.
You know enough to know that Bitcoin's high volatility has more to do with the fact that it is a very tiny cork floating on the world's ocean of fiat currency, people's lack of trust (totally reasonable) in a brand new form of money, and it's extraordinary ratio of speculative activity -vs- actual usage.
To even suggest that the reason Bitcoin is volatile has to do with it's limited supply is incredibly disingenuous and intellectually dishonest. After all, the Bitcoin money supply has been massively expansionary for it's entire lifetime, and is still inflating (true definition) at over 4%.

I see, my apologies, thanks for setting me straight on that.
The value of a stock, particularly an early-stage startup, is highly speculative in nature.
Yes, the intention is that the value of the stock will increase as the value of the company increases, but there's no clear-cut golden rule about how much value is "true" and how much is "speculative."
Amazon, for instance, was frequently criticized by some investors as highly speculative due to high P/E ratios, while confident investors could see that the high P/E ratios were the result of re-investment to continue to grow the business.
A bitcoin is not a share of nothing! It *is* a share of the total money supply on the Bitcoin network. You perceive that the same way value investors viewed Amazon shares -- why invest in something that makes no money? Others perceive that as a wise investment due to the enormous value they believe Bitcoin may add to the world in the future.
Many investors did well investing in internet companies early on. They could see the value that the internet would bring to the world, and understood that some early companies would become valuable by tapping into the newly created value of the internet itself.
Cisco did well, for instance, because they captured a small portion of the total value of the internet by selling tools that allowed the internet itself to be assembled.
But imagine if early investors could have actually invested in the internet as a whole...
That's how I see Bitcoin. It's not a sure thing, but if it revolutionizes money flow the way the internet revolutionized data flow, then I want to own bitcoin now, before it's as obvious to everyone as it is obvious to me now: the old system of money is creaky, inefficient, insecure, and fundamentally capricious and unfair.
I have no interest in ever selling my bitcoin for government backed currencies. Instead I intend to hold it until I can use it to purchase goods and services from producers and providers who wish to have their own bitcoin.

They're generally pegged one-to-one with Bitcoin.
Imagine a transaction that move some bitcoin off the blockchain and onto a sidechain. There, it can be utilized be the rules of the sidechain: faster confirmations, anonymity, larger blocks, super-voodoo powers, you name it, a sidechain will eventually do it.
And eventually back again to the blockchain, or another sidechain. Always Bitcoin.

Yes, we both love Bitcoin, and yes, it'll happen.
The idea that ten minutes is too slow, because it seems incredibly slow when other things are measured in milliseconds, and that merchants won't adopt because of confirmation time is a meme that:
  1) is continuously repeated
  2) flies in the face of history (checks) and reality (cards)
  3) is often voiced by "no consumer protection" detractors
  4) might be believed by non-technical merchants
The constant drum beat on this subject drives me mad! :-)
Bitcoin confirms, in the same semantics in cards, 4,380x fast cards, yet even supporters of Bitcoin point it out as a flaw.
It is one hour slower than hard cash, but cash use is on the decline, and it's much easier, convenient, less expensive, more secure, and faster to transport value more than a trivial distance.

I don't think that's quite what people mean by triple-entry accounting with respect to crypto-currencies.
Triple-entry accounting, as explained to me by everyone that uses it with respect to crypto, means that there are three ledgers (not entries!) involved in every inter-entity transaction: sender, blockchain, receiver.
This makes reconciliation easier because it removes the he-said/she-said duality of reconciliation: internal books must agree upon the indisputable public ledger.

In my experience chatting with people that don't believe it, they have very weak technical understanding of the issue, are generally not software developers, and have poor debate skills as well.

I cannot imagine why anyone would measure the Bitcoin mining network in [FLOPS](
I don't believe there are any floating point operations in the hashing algorithm, they're most commonly composed purely of binary and/or integer operations.
Even if the hashing algorithm uses or is implemented via some floating point operations, the ASICS used perform the hashing would not be reasonably measured in FLOPS as they're entirely uniform in their applications, whereas FLOPS are general purpose floating point operations.
Google's compute capacity trumps the Bitcoin network's capacity for any problem except computing Bitcoin mining hashes.

Imagine how much slower it would be if block size had been increased years ago...

The same way you set a price in Dollars, Euros, Pesos or any other currency.
Nearly every time you buy something you pay a different price. Consider gasoline, eggs or milk.
If you don't pay the same price in your local currency for basic items like gas, eggs and milk, then the value of your local currency is continuously changing too.
You've come to believe that your currency is stable, and that price of everything else changes. This not not true!
Have you ever heard an old person describe how inexpensive things used to be? Did the value of those things go up, or did the value of the currency go down?

Bitcoin has invested zero in protecting itself and transacts $80 million/day currently.
PaySafe wasn't a new currency. It wasn't a new payment rail. It isn't a new commodity, and isn't a store of value. While I appreciate the success that they've had, they had a very smooth ride compared to Bitcoin because it is built atop a banking system that is centuries old...
Comparing it to Bitcoin is like comparing the volume of postal-mail SPAM delivered by a marketing company that was 6 years old in 1988 with the volume of SMTP (email) deliveries in 1988, 6 years after it was standardized (1982!) and concluding that SMTP was a laggard.

I think EVERY SINGLE WALLET is deficient in it's ability to inform the user of the true state of their system.
Every single one needs improvements to better inform everyone -- newbies in particular -- of the true nature of the balances.
It appears that each and everyone one (unintentionally) misinforms users that their balance is reduced the moment a transaction is broadcast, which is why so many people are afraid that their money is going to get lost somehow.
I don't know the solution, but whichever UI designer resolves this issue is going to attract a LOT of users to their wallet.

Bitcoin's main feature is that it's distributed. The more distributed Bitcoin is, the less chance there is that malicious actors of any kind can do nefarious things to it. That's CENTRAL to the value of Bitcoin as a technology.
Raising the block size increases the cost of running a fully validating node -- which makes Bitcoin more distributed. If we scale Bitcoin by block size alone, it WILL become centralized as very wealthy enterprises who can afford data center space, gigabit + internet connections, and SAN systems will be the only entities that can afford to run nodes.
In addition, increasing the block size does not fixing transaction malleability (which is, IMHO, massive technical debt). Finally, there is a quadratic(!) scaling issue that will, eventually -- at a time that nobody can really guess -- disrupt Bitcoin entirely.
SegWit is a terrific option that is deployed and waiting for network consensus to be enabled. It fixes those issues and eases and/or enables the ability to continue to refine and extend Bitcoin, including low-latency (planetary sub-second), low-cost payment sub systems, the most anticipated today is named Lightning Network.
I've no-doubt left a few things out, but that covers the basics.

I don't know, mark-to-market makes a ton of sense so long as you do it regularly.
It cuts both ways -- going up, and -- going down.
A thing is worth what you can get for it, therefore an asset is worth different values at different points in time.
Without mark-to-market, if a purchase is made at top-of-market then the books would always show higher asset value than is reasonable and vice-versa...
How do you value Bitcoins you hold? At their original purchase price? (convenient to know, sure) or at their current value? (also convenience to know)

Back in the early 90's there were many competing networking standards: Netware's IPX/SPX, Microsoft's NetBui, Apple's AppleTalk. There were others even earlier and less widely utilized, but those were the "Big 4" of networking.
Only the Unix guys used TCP/IP. It was "just" a 4 layer stack, everyone "knew" that 7 layer OSI stacks were "superior", etc.
Then the internet started growing, and it used TCP/IP. There were HUGE "tech wars" about when, why, how, who were using which, and why -- what were the benefits, which would "scale", etc.
Many vendors insisted that TCP/IP was inferior to their tech, and the internet? That's just crazy talk! You SIMPLY CANNOT connect your CORPORATE NETWORK, to a network built on inferior technology.
Billions of dollars were spent on gateways to bridge these superior networks to the internet, mostly for mail delivery. SMTP was TERRIBLE compared to Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange, but the ability to send email to other places, far far away, was important.
Of course, all of that eventually went away. Network, Microsoft and Apple rebuilt atop TCP/IP. Every mail vendor is now SMTP compliant. The billions spent on gateways is long forgotten.

Technical analysis does not work. It may have once, though I doubt it, but no trading strategy ever remains viable once it leaves the realm of secrecy.
One "strategy" that *always* works is information advantage.
I predicted that the price of Bitcoin would rise -- in the long term -- because I had technical knowledge of how Bitcoin works, how it was different than the ways things are currently done, how much of a problem this is for software developers wanting to work on anything that connects to the financial system, etc.
I may be wrong, but I invested in something that I believed was going to be enormously valuable in the future, so your estimate of 1,000 by January is, in my opinion, possible -- and, perhaps even timid.
But I don't believe for a minute, and recommend to anyone reading this with an open mind, don't believe for a moment that technical analysis works or, even worse, that Asimovian psychohistory is possible due to the blockchain.

Of course it wasn't, but the economic system of Bitcoin was created to include both decreasing block reward, and transaction fees.


I support SegWit because of the bugs it fixes, the future it makes portends, and *fact* that it is a compromise with the big block folks who refuse to see it as such.
It might be technically better if the transaction limit was kept the same, or reduced, but that's clearly not going to be acceptable to the group of people who want big blocks but refuse to see that SegWit for the transaction capacity increase and blocksize increase that it is...


And limiting SPAM attacks.


Blah, blah, blah.
Satoshi is/was a genius and I'm a big fan. But he was NEVER omnipotent.
Transaction malleability, ASICBOOST, and (from what I've heard) the code base Satoshi left behind make it quite clear that Satoshi was mortal.


Unnecessarily is in the eye of the beholder.


Different people use Bitcoin in different ways. You mention two issues, high fees and high confirmation times, but they're both a single problem in my mind, transactions that aren't required to be in the incredibly valuable and scarce Bitcoin blockchain sent by people that don't understand that.
You simply cannot scale Bitcoin on chain. This is neither a statement of sorcery nor superstition.
The Bitcoin blockchain can and must become a settlement layer unless someone introduces something fundamentally new.

Credit card transactions are not instantaneous.
You must wait days to receive the cash from the processor, longer on weekends, and charge-backs are possible for 3-6 months after the payment is "confirmed."
P.S. If a customer decides to charge back, the scales are generally tipped in their favor, and an additional $30+ fee is charged to the vendor, so a $1 credit card "confirmed" transaction can result in a $31 loss to the vendor.

There's no need to eliminate technical debt for traditional transactions should SegWit activate.
To suggest that SegWit adds technical debt is a ridiculous scare tactic. It is equivalent or better in every way than traditional transactions.
While it's true that you can't say "If you build it they will come" you can say with great confidence "if you don't build it they won't come."
Does the community want sub-second confirmation, inexpensive, micro-payment compatible "coffee" transactions?
I do, and I think think "we" do.

and beat me too it, and their answers are correct :-)
It's definitely easier to start a new wallet and transfer your funds into it. Less chance of mistakes, less time, only costs a few cents. :-)
Also, please be clear that a wallet is not a formal Bitcoin construct. Bitcoin knows only addresses, which are fairly similar to accounting/bank accounts.
One big difference, however, is that for optimal security and (surprisingly) convenience, best practices demand that accounts be used only once to receive, and once to spend.
If you have an address with 5 BTC in it, and you need to spend one, it's ideal to make a transaction that spends all 5 BTC, 1 to where you intended to spend it, 4 to a new address, known as a change address, which the wallet generates automatically for you.
Older wallets used entirely mathematically unrelated addresses. Newer HD wallets (BIP32, hierarchical, deterministic) use a series of related addresses, though the relationship between the addresses is not discernible externally.
These wallets typically use a mnemonic phrase (BIP39) to encode the key, which makes it easier to use the same HD address set in two different wallets, or to recover the address set if a wallet is damaged, or lost.
Hope this helps!

I'm a huge believer in [ancient accounting standards]( but I believe you're mixing concepts when you mash up GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) with concepts such as mark-to-market (making accounting entries to show market values of assets rather than originally booked value), derivatives (not an accounting concept at all -- a type of contract), short selling (borrowing shares to sell them) and insurance (contracts to hedge against potential future loss, i.e. institutionalized gambling).

Long term capital gains are those held for 1 year and are taxed favorably to income, which is earned by labor (for individuals) or business operation.

As for miners doing it already, leaserig.net shows less than 30,000 GH/s which isn't a credible threat to the 375,000,000 GH/s network, which clearly excludes them from my "leading miner" qualifier.

@_date: 2015-03-10 08:10:47
I believe in the mid-term the cost of running the network is more a function of security desired (hash power) than transaction volume, therefore likely to scale with the value of Bitcoin and not the transaction volume.
None of the gargantuan hashing power is used to process transactions, it's all used to provide security.
The current transaction volume could be handled by 3 (multiple for redundancy, odd for consensus!) original iPhones mining the network, but it wouldn't be very secure. :-)
In the future a level of hashing power will be achieved that will inspire confidence in the system's ability to withstand external attacks, i.e. be "bigger than anyone." The rate of increase in the cost of mining will decline from the "get it secure" rate it's growing at now to a "keep it secure" level.
There will be a substantial contraction in the cost/transaction as the previously under-utilized transaction capacity becomes utilized. This will be the second golden age for Bitcoin miners: their capital outlays will diminish from growth levels to maintenance levels, and their incomes will rise with increased transaction fees. I suspect that only a portion of these cost reductions will be passed onto users, and that transactions fees will rise as a percentage of miner cost.
Additionally, the network *will* begin pruning. How many blocks of confirmation do we need to keep currently distributed -vs- complete sets which are of interest mostly to historians?
For these reasons, I believe it's logical to conclude that the cost of operating the Bitcoin network will scale sub-linearly -vs- transaction volume.

Perhaps it would make sense to:

  2) Have a cup of coffee while waiting for a confirmation
  3) Verify that the account your coin is coming from has more than enough funds
@_date: 2015-03-30 01:44:41
It would happen because of supply, demand, and weak hands.
I see how the public is radically misinformed about Bitcoin. I understand why, at this early stage, people who have dipped their toes might scatter with the wind.
I also know how they'll buy back in, 10-100x, should Bitcoin go vertical again. Many people have heard of the opportunity and passed it by. They will kick themselves if it happens again, and vow "never again!"
I have around 10% of opportunity cash in Bitcoin. If the price drops that low, I'd take it to 12-15% and triple-ish my coins, perhaps go 1-2% of 401k if $GBTC was priced the same.
I believe Bitcoin is going to be worth a ton unless:
  1) something else replaces it; nothing in sight!
  2) something goes wrong; nothing in sight!
People are free to disagree, but I think they lack imagination. Bitcoin will not simple fade away. It's incredibly powerful and useful technology that is a massive improvement to the core of civilization, just as the internet was.
People who point out every foible and flaw, real and perceived, would have predicted that nobody would use mobile phones because:
  1) dropped calls; land lines are superior call quality.

They'll all have reasons soon enough. There's no rushing it -- particularly since trust in such a critical thing as money is hard to earn and Bitcoin forces people to believe in something entirely new -- a decentralized authority.

Bob cannot. He should wait until confirmation are received.

I'm sure we both know that inflation can be measured two ways: 1) increased money supply, 2) decreased purchasing power.
Money supply is a useful and interesting measurement as is purchasing power.
I'm quite clear purchasing power is your yard stick. USD purchasing power of US real estate *clearly* increased YoY as the real estate bubble burst in 2007, as it *clearly* increased YoY in ability to purchase ownership in companies.

Yes, fiat cash (presently) has a few privacy advantages and a few massive disadvantages -vs- digital fiat: transportability sucks, secure storage is difficult and expensive, and physical evidence such as fingerprints, serial numbers, fiber evidence, etc.
Bitcoin has the public transaction record, which may or may not last forever, but everything else is antiseptically clean. Volatility is an issue when going down, but a huge advantage when going up.
The reason these sorts of cash controls are enacted are to reduce illicit System D profits from entering the convenient banking system.
Bitcoin is a trade off: secure, pseudonymous, non-confiscatable (from the outside), free of all physical concerns, transportable, and free from direct state control.

The world has never seen a currency as "hard" as bitcoin.
It's scarcity is closer to a Van Gough than to a currency.
So, it's not so much about how much it's being used, but by how many people want to have some, and how many there are available.
Which is to say it's all about supply and demand. :-)

But what you've discussed is NOT a hack or manipulation of the blockchain.
And, properly educated -- or with sophisticated enough software in place -- even the scam you described is not possible.
Bitcoin allows people to operate in a trust-free environment. Since that's a new concept, many prefer to trust others -- and for the technically challenged this may be a good choice -- but by far the biggest weakness is at the fiat/crypto border, i.e. exchanges and brokerages.
And it's not necessary the exchange's and brokerage's fault -- it's the detritus of thousands of years of trust-based financial systems and mindsets that can (and will!) be manipulated over and over -- just as credit card fraud is a always growing, never-ending, problem.

Realistic? You can use it today, it's 100% real.
Answer: precisely the way it is: through increasing value, desirability, and distribution.
It doesn't need to do anything. It's gone from 1 holder to millions in less than a decade and grows more quickly each day than the last.


Asked and answered previously, simple repeat: fantastic utility increases adoption, increases value, increases utility.
That's a virtuous cycle.


So say you. I'll let the market decide. It **has been** the best store of value since it was introduced in 2009. No amount of your concern can offset the truth of that.
If you cannot understand why others value it highly, that may be an empathy issue on your part. It may also be the rest of us are wrong.


I sort of agree, but I see it as a continuous function where you see it as a binary outcome.


That's demonstrably untrue.
There's **massive** speculation in fiat currency markets
I'd encourage you to **actively** work on considering whether your current beliefs are based on reality, or fear.


Continuous function.
It's not like the entirely world will one day wake and up and think "OMG, Bitcoin has become stable, I'm out!"
More likely, as the value plateaus and stabilizes relative to real property, goods and services the widespread holders will begin to circulate it as currency.
Consider: you buy 10 BTC today, in three years (or 15) each BTC becomes worth $2M+ would you buy a nice house in Hawaii for 1 BTC or wait for it to become worth $3M?
Whatever your answer is, everyone will make their own decision. The higher the value, the lower the volatility, the more circulation will occur.
As I've said, it can derail on the way for a variety of reasons; I'm not suggesting it will happen this way. Predicting the future is hard.

The worst aspect of new points being created is that those closest to point creation have a system advantage over this who do not -- and another thing that is even more insidious:
Inflation allows the masses to believe their income is growing when it's actually shrinking relative to the entire system.
This allows the confidence game to be played for many *generations* before the masses wake up and suddenly realize they're poorer than they had previously realized...
During the middle game, a small number of individuals end up accumulating most of the real assets in exchange for the worthless paper they've created.

Do keep in mind that I've explained to people many times in my post history that there's ZERO difference between a SPAM transaction and a non-SPAM transaction, so the very concept of SPAM is bogus and I only used to to demonstrate how your position, which you stated as a factual, might be wrong.
My point is the you're trying to predict the outcome of an incredibly chaotic system.
Always keep in mind that miners can include transactions free-of-transaction fee. While this will reduce their income, that's not the same as requiring cash to fill the blocks.

Major problem? Prove it!
Block rewards are tied to the number of transactions via transactions fees. Yes, I know they're currently minimal, but it's important to understand that this behavior is limited by:
  1) Miner's know block reward in real terms will be zero should they mine every block with zero transactions, as that would tank the price of Bitcoin
  2) As transaction value grows, this behavior will be sub-optimal.
It's never a good idea to turn an event into a trend. The time to become concerned is when the trend indicates movement toward un-sustainability, and there's no break in place to taper the trend, which in this case, there is.

What folks always ask is whether accounting can be automated. It can, but not in the "click a button and it's done via payment stream" way folks think.
Accounting is a tool to measure the aspects of business you feel are critical to monitor.
There are rules about how certain things must be accounted for, but these rules are very high level and leave a lot of room for specialization of implementation.
As a serial entrepreneur I feel that my view accounting as a necessary evil was one of the things that has held me back. If you're an entrepreneur and wish you could make accounting go away, I highly recommend you rethink that attitude. :-)

Keep in mind that current fees at higher volumes will increase total fees.
100x the volume, 100x the fees!
The cost of mining scales with security offered, not transaction volume. The current network, with the current hardware, could probably handle 100x the volume with no additional cost.
Of course, with 100x the volume, price likely rises, which drives investment to capture the higher block reward, which increases security appropriately.

They're going to need to react to external stimulus, like all other businesses have to on a continuous basis.
In this case, they have several obvious reactions (and no-doubt an array not obvious to me):
  1) lower their costs -- unclear how they'd do this, potentially renegotiating with their electrical utility
  2) raise their prices -- unclear how much pricing elasticity there is, only time will tell
  3) go out of business
  4) invest capital to weather the storm
  5) invest capital to consolidate miners who choose 
Note that each miner will have different, though similar, cost structures, and actual costs of common items will vary as well.
Even in the event that there proves to be little elasticity in the Bitcoin price (which I personally doubt) and miners are faced with slim-to-no-margins -- or even negative margins -- some will choose to invest more capital to cover what they believe to be temporary losses as the field shakes out and, unfortunately, consolidates.
I think the worst possible outcome is increased centralization of mining due to response  The upside to  is that it reduces the likelihood of a dramatic hash-rate reduction.
Keep in mind that miners are, by definition, playing a very long game, and most have been playing it for a long time. While the block reward is the short-term prize I believe most miners are focused on the long-game prize of "owning" a significant portion of the future stream of transaction processing fees.
Visa, et. al. have shown that raking a portion of each transaction is a fantastic business model. Bitcoin will no-doubt lower the margin, but by 2024 or so being a significant miner could easily provide a low-stress, continuous profit stream for many decades to come.

This question has been asked thousands of time, some Googling would be a good idea...
Here's my take:
  1) You don't really want it to be stable. Clearly it would be better if its value rose over time. When people fear volatility, they really fear de-valuation. Everyone wants maximum volatility for the items they posses, so long as it's upward volatility.
  2) USD isn't stable. It only appears to be stable because it's the most common thing that other items are priced against. When prices change, we think of the item's price being volatile, but in some cases, the pricing change may be a reflection of volatility in the currency.
  3) USD isn't alone in its volatility. EUR has devalued from $1.30 to $1.00 in the last few months. Gold has bounced around as well. Real estate too, particularly in 2007-2008.
  4) The reason your home currency appears stable is due to a few reasons:
      a) you have contracted cash-flow, i.e. your pay, rent, mortgage, car payment, etc.
      b) most people don't travel enough to witness the fluctuating value of their home currencies -vs- others.
In short, USD probably is the most stable currency in the world because it is the most widely held, most widely accepted, and most widely transacted, i.e. it is the current reserve currency of the world.
Bitcoin will stabilize only if it grows and becomes the world reserve currency. I personally believe it has a better than even chance of doing so, though I have no idea how long it might take.
And finally, I personally have no interest in Bitcoin becoming stable. I want it's value to rise like a Saturn V rocket taking off, and be the most upwardly volatile currency in all of history.

Whether or not it's a bug with wisdom, the chart could easily be described as a market in action.

The Bitcoin markets are small and illiquid, and have many, many trading bots in operation due to the technical nature of the community.

No! And...yes!
A wallet is not an account -- Bitcoin has no accounts.
A wallet is a collection of addresses managed automatically to act much like a traditional bank account.
An address made by your wallet can be used to receive many times. While it's possible to to use an address to spend many times, it does not provide optimal security for a couple of reasons.
Receiving to only a single address also provides a public record of how much has been received for the life of the account. This may be useful in some cases, but problematic in others.
Spending from a single address multiple times reduces security on a technical level and is also not recommended.

Ok, so $2,500/BTC to $25,000/BTC.


Wow, no, I believe fees would remain the same in satoshi/byte, and therefore cost 10x as much in USD terms.
Why do you think they'd stay the same in dollar terms?
Fees recently peaked in **both** BTC and USD terms.
The main reason your logic is wrong is in two parts:
The market for Bitcoin transactions fees is BTC only.
When the price of Bitcoin rises, miners invest additional capital to increase their hash rate to keep up with everyone else. That capital buys the equipment, their electricity costs rise, but the same number of Bitcoin are mined.

The logic of the future cost of operating the Bitcoin network is flawed.
There is zero reason to assume that the cost will scale linearly, nor that the current "cost" of operating it is related to transaction volume.
For the vast majority of Bitcoin holders and miners (as opposed to users) Bitcoin is a speculative venture.
Miners are investing at present levels because they can, not because they need to. Just a few nodes could handle the traffic (but not the security).
The security issue is an interesting one! When will we have "enough" hashing power to feel safe from a hostile attack?

Not if the mixing is well done, both on the mixer side and on the mixee side.
It may be shown that there's a probability that coins that came out of a mixer were from addresses thst put them into the mixer. The probability is inversely proportional to the number of participating input addresses in the mix.
The problem with mixing is the need to trust the mixer.

@_date: 2017-07-10 05:27:21
One great thing about a fixed money supply is that when someone gets ahold of a ton, the rest in circulation will become more scarce and more valuable.
Should the hoarder begin to spend, they'll be more available and reduce in value.
The opposite happens today, we can see that over time and particularly since 2008: wealth distribution is at an all time high, causing the rest of the population to become relatively poor and unable to spend.
So more money is created in an attempt to spur spending, devaluing the cash the middle and lower class maintain as larger percentages of their wealth than the wealthier do. In particular, the lowest classes hold essentially 100% of their wealth in cash since they're typically living on a paycheck-to-paycheck basis.
As the wealthier corner the market on assets, the newly created money flows to those closest to the creation, and next to those who own the productive assets, and which once again increases the inequality in a viscious cycle.

You don't know that.
Since it cannot activate today in any case, so whatever point you're trying to make is irrelevant.
If we're going to imagine what might happen, in my fantasy land a huge portion of new transactions are SegWit transactions and the backlog starts dropping steadily.


Not so in my fantasy land, where spammers nearly immediately fill the blocks with bogus cheap transactions, confirmation times and fees continue to rise, and the network becomes more centralized as node operators groan under double the storage and bandwidth requirements for no change in fees and confirmation times.

What does "straight up overcharging with ridiculous fees" mean in a free market?
Pricing and distribution are inextricably linked.
If you want Bitcoin from that ATM, that's the price. It's your choice whether or not to pay it.
the ATM operators no-doubt test different pricing models. They'll pick the one that brings them the most profit. If they charge too little, they'll lose money. If they charge too much, they'll lose money.
The success of their business is just as inextricably linked to their ability to get the price "right" for their market, regardless of what you think that price is.

Six month settlement time for merchants.
Nevertheless, I suspect this could be offered if, for instance:

  2) The margin on the service allowed for self-insurance. This could be in the form of service fees and/or exchange rate spread.
As Bitcoin grows, I suspect the large providers will be tripping over themselves to offer this service in an effort to offset the income reduction Bitcoin will present.

I think that Bitcoin will allow accounting to be automated.
The number one difficulty Subledger's customers encounter in their quest to automate their accounting is the lack of end-to-end identifiers in the banking system.
You hit an API to charge a card and receive a confirmation. By the time money arrives in your bank account, there's  no trivially automatable way to figure out which confirmed transactions are in the deposit.
This is made even more difficult when different card rails pay on different schedules, take their fees in different ways, and provide reconciliation data in different formats.
In short, the banking system is surprisingly opaque and terribly non-uniform. I say surprisingly because it's such a highly regulated industry yet there appear to be very few information exchange standards.

Total wealth includes real property, not just currency!
No percentage of real estate value will migrate to Bitcoin, nor will oil wells, working farms, ranches, businesses, artwork, etc.
I did some Googling a few years ago and came to conclusion that Bitcoin's total potential value was somewhere between 50-100T USD.

Stability is useful, but not nearly as useful as significant upward volatility. Volatility is a measure of instability, both upward and downward.
In any case, Bitcoin price cannot stay stable for long. It's a cork floating in an ocean of fiat currencies. With luck, the cork will absorb the fiat currencies' desirability.
If this happens, Bitcoin will appear stable and the other currencies will fluctuate around it.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:40:34


Off topic and/or moving the goal posts.
Nevertheless, volatility is down AND up. In Bitcoin's life, more up than down. So Bitcoin's volatility is, on average, good for you.


False dichotomy.
You have to choose between many thousands of currencies/stores of value/units of account -- including somewhere around 1,000 cryptocurrencies.
And yet, here you are. Congratulations on cutting through the noise. ��
BCC is a new coin that joins the thousand or so others competing against Bitcoin.


The same reason as the rest of us: because you want it.
In your own words: "I enjoy the concept of peer-to-peer banking and I have always been enthusiastic about a currency that was not under the thumb of the super wealthy power brokers of the world."


Which is to say business could never have existed before Keynesian economics existed. ��
If you want to hold Bitcoin, simply accept it.
There's zero chance a tidal wave of Bitcoiners will descend upon you, particularly if you don't advertise it on a Bitcoin forum. If too many do show up, you can say "I've had a bigger than expected response and I've accepted all that I can handle."
This means you'll divert a small, controllable amount of your profit into Bitcoin, without paying any exchange fees.
Hold it for a year, and then decide whether you'd wish to continue accepting it.
All that is required is a Bitcoin wallet and a mention that you accept it.
If you don't want to hold bitcoin, then you've already made up your mind, so why are you here?
Being in business is, itself, considered highly risky by the bulk of the population. Risk and reward are highly correlated, so you understand better than most that nothing is risk-free.

Currency is called currency because it is used to flow value through the economy, just as a river flows water through the countryside.
If your concern was valid, there would be no way that Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Carlos Slim, Elon Musk, Dr. Dre, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey and many other "upstarts" could be as wealthy as they are.
The great thing about Bitcoin is that as the wealth of the world increases, everyone's bitcoin holdings, no matter how small, increase in value.
Another way to think about it is that when an individual hoards bitcoin, everyone else gets wealthy as those bitcoin no longer are in free circulation. This is true only for cash holdings, of course.

No! Miners do not validate transactions or blocks, nodes do.
So long as there are too many nodes to take down, the network can always be altered by the will of the majority of users.

Your hash power is not fixed, it's relative to total hash power on the network.
If total network hash power doubled overnight, you'd be expected to make half as much (as measured in bitcoin). It would also be expected that blocks would be found every 5 minutes instead of 10.
Every 2,016 blocks, the difficulty of the hash creation is adjusted up or down to target 10 minute blocks given current total network hash rate.
Hope that helps.

The reason open source makes it more trustworthy is that tech savvy individuals can check how it works, and fix it when there's a problem.
There are ways to be certain that the software on your device is identical to the code that's being watched constantly.
The basic premise is that the only way to move coins is with a transaction properly signed with the correct private key. With a hardware wallet, NOBODY knows the private key, as it never leaves the device.
An unsigned transaction is fed into it, it signs the transaction and sends the signed transaction back out.
That transaction can be trivially verified to be the same transaction as put in, with the addition of being signed.

If you're referring to the current release 0.10.0 you cannot eliminate trailing zeros the way you have; the way you've done it would indicate that the current version predates 0.4 to 0.9, which it does not.
0.10.0 does not have lite-wallet, and was never advertised to. It enables headers-first syncing, which should make the wallet useful more quickly, but it is still going to be a full-node when syncing is complete.
Upcoming versions will likely implement pruning, which should put it in a nice place between a full-node and a "lite-wallet" (your term, not mine).

Smart contracts are far less useful today for non-digital-world applications.
That will change as IoT concepts make far more things digitally identifiable.

Here's the only "advertising" for the feature set of 0.10.0 to the best of my knowledge: 
You may be surprised that neither "feather", "lite", nor "light" are words in that release note. It *does* become usable more quickly, and synchronizes more quickly, than previous versions.
Do you know that the application is known as a reference implementation, and forms the basis of not just a client, but also full nodes and miners as well?
Essentially, it's a bit of a toolkit to allow the core developers to communicate, in code, how the various aspects of Bitcoin are intended to work together.
Version 0.10.0 is a major milestone. It's is a massive improvement in its own right, and paves the way for pruning, as I understand it, which is probably why you were confused that this release is something that it is not.
One of the coolest things in this release is a custom, built-for-purpose, crypto library that is very efficient, and extremely well tested.
I'm certain that the core developers won't be shocked that you're not a big fan of the client.
But it they deserve a lot of praise for the good work that they're doing, many for free, as an act of love for the underlying concepts and technologies involved.
I, for one, appreciate the hard work and dedication that has went into every single release.

No, it saves energy cost because it reduces the number of hashes that need to be tried, which means it's effectively additional hash power, which absolutely speeds up block discovery.
It's adjusted every 2016 blocks so overall it doesn't increase block finding, but switching it on between adjustments would absolutely decrease block time, on average.

One piece of advice: when you sell -- or better yet buy things with your BTC in the future, file quarterly or you may be fined for late payment.
P.S. I've paid zero cost basis capital gains on largish sums and the IRS has NEVER been grateful in any way, so don't get your hopes up on that. ��

When you send a payment, a transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin Network.
Your wallet will show that transaction as "sent", "pending", "unconfirmed", etc. and show your balance as reduced from the amount shown before the transaction was sent.
But until that payment confirms, the money has not moved. It's not in limbo. There is no limbo in Bitcoin. Well, that's not 100% true, but that's another story and it is true that there is no limbo at this point, before the the first confirmation.
There are a variety of mechanisms in Bitcoin to handle this situation, most notably Replace-By-Fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP).
RBF is generally used by the sender, and CPFP is generally used by the receiver.
Not many wallets support them, so I'm not sure if this helps much.
Bitcoin is a very deep rabbit hole. While the system has been around since 2010, the software that runs the network is version 0.14.1 -- which indicates that it's not considered final, so you can expect rough edges, particularly when you factor in the wallets, which are entirely separate software projects for the most part.
Take your time, be careful, listen to advice on security, and just be patient.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:06:14
You're free to do so.
All you need to do is download a wallet an use it to accept payment. You should account for the income in USD at the time of purchase.
If you don't convert your BTC to cash, you're done. If you do, you'll need to report capital gain/loss on the difference between the USD value when you accepted it and when you converted it back to USD.
There are sites that automate this process. Your wallet has all the information that allows the capital gain/loss to be automatically calculated.
If you're an online site, develop/hire-a-developer/install-a-plugin. Above information still applies.
You probably shouldn't expect a surge in business from this, it seems everyone wants to hold onto their BTC when the price is rising rapidly.
Accepting BTC is the IDEAL way to accumulate BTC if you want to hold it long term.

You need to buy $105+ CAD worth of Bitcoin and send them $100 CAD worth of Bitcoin:
Why $5 extra? Because the rates fluctuate constantly and the amount of BTC per $100 CAD will not be the same between step one and 2, and you'll also need to pay a small fee on step 2 that your wallet will include automatically, so it's worth buying a few $ extra to make sure you can complete the transaction.

The debit/credit card transaction confirmation you mention is loosely equivalent to broadcasting a Bitcoin transaction to the network.
I'm willing to bet that Bitcoin transaction clearing ratio is far better than the 98% you claim for cards.
Better yet, every ten minutes confidence rises, whereas with cards you simply cannot be sure for at least 6 months and in some situations (see other responses this thread) much longer.

The amount of cash would never be adjusted via MTM -- and the original purchase transactions would always record the original prices paid.
MTM simply adjusts assets, liabilities (rarely) and equity to show the current state of the company.

It's because people who, IMHO, deeply understand the technology know that Bitcoin is a staggering exclusive Venn diagram of:
previously existing and/or widely used technologies:
• mostly non-encryption cryptography
• peer-to-peer networking
• distributed application theory
• graph theory
• game theory
• proof of work (compute-inefficiency!?! Who'd have guessed?)
distinctly fresh technology:
• Nakamoto consensus
distinctly fresh currency:
• no permission required (innovative)
• no trust required (perfectly trustworthy)
• not physically confiscatable
• not counterfeitable
• perfectly accountable
distinctly fresh economic theory:
• Austrianish economics
• future predictable money supply
• distributed, de minimus seignorage
The idea of "blockchain, not Bitcoin" is based upon the belief that Nakamoto(ish) consensus alone is the big breakthrough, but the currency and economic theory are the parts that are valuable enough to foot the incredible expense -- which is the foundation of its ultimate security -- of operating the blockchain.

@_date: 2016-07-07 15:28:23
It's certainly doable, and is being done continuously.
As mentioned, it's often called high frequency trading.
When people used to do it, they were called market makers.
When it's done between exchanges (exchange a is higher than b, so buy on b and sell on a) it's called arbitrage.
For some reason, people have a bad taste for high frequency trading, but not so much for arbitrage. Perhaps because arbitrage has the effect of equalizing exchange rates amongst different exchanges.
Perhaps the simplest reason it's not as simple as you think it is is because:
  1) many are already doing it
  2) it's difficult to filter out the noise of normal trading
  3) you really need to understand order books and how they occasionally have a huge effect on the price.

No, it's IMPOSSIBLE.
Bitcoin cannot stabilize until it's found its bouancy point in the world's currency and store of value system.
It's like a new ballon, created at the bottom of the ocean, rising to the surface. Sometimes whales swim by and storms of gigantic proportions cause it to move up and down dramatically.
It's been rising for 8 years. It's less than 1% of the way to the top.
Only at the top will it achieve it's lowest volatility.
Never forget that upward movement is volatility too! So saying people won't use it -- as currency or store of value -- until it's stable is saying nobody wants things that increase in value.

They're not. You need to pay enough to get included. That price was zero for a very long time, it's been non-zero for quite some time now.

If BTC becomes worth billions of US dollars (you didn’t specify which fiat) it’s only because USD has inflated dramatically.
There appears to be somewhere around $100T USD value in fiat currency and gold in existence today.
That appears to put an upper limit of around $3-4M USD per bitcoin, in today’s value.

World currency valuation in dollars, roughly, $100T
A single bitcoin’s eventual value should be $100T/21M in today’s value once it replaces all inferior currencies, which will probably never entirely happen, and will surely take a long time to approach that sort of dominance.
Nobody knows the future. Many things could dethrone Bitcoin as best money. None are very likely, IMHO.

Attractive is all it takes


Only through a decrease in scarcity, impossible with Bitcoin


Of that we can agree on, Bitcoin is political neutral, yet another benefit.


Yes, we're very early on in adoption. It's clear that to me that Bitcoin will need to be more widely coveted as a store of value before it will be an everyday currency.
Which is very different than saying it'll never be a widely used currency.


It's easy to imagine if you put $1,000 in 7 years ago (when far more people believed as you do today that Bitcoin could never be a currency) and it's now worth millions of dollars.
Also note that you're arguing against a continuation of an 8 year history of usage and value increases.
At some point "it can't happen" becomes "I should have bought some previously" and "what was I afraid of?" which are waypoints along the way to "I need some!"
Everyone has to make this journey on their own, given their tech saavy, risk tolerance, available risk capital, etc.

You are correct that the blockchain prevents double spending.
Here is where you are wrong: you've always been able to double-transact UTXOs and it has been show to be quite easy to get a transaction created and distributed "after" another to get included in the blockchain.
RBF makes this much more difficult, because you must signal to the receiving party (and the world!) that you may plan to do so.
The opposite is also true: you can now signal to the receiving party (and the world) that you have ZERO INTENTION of doing so.

I think you've missed the mark a bit here, if you don't mind having dialogue on this topic.
As with most things in life, it's easy to think in terms of two options, when frequently there are many more available. I believe the term "outside the box" is attributed to those who most easily slip that trap.
It's entirely conceivable that the optimal economic solution is both on- and off-chain scaling with soft-limits in place for traffic bursts such as holidays, and auto-adjustment at a rate below bandwidth and disk space growth to allow the fee market to grow over a longer length of time.
While firmly supporting core, respecting their concerns about non-linear scaling, being anxious with respect to maintaining the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, and understanding more clearly than ever the dangers of a conventions hard-fork having witnessed the Ethereum fork -- there could come a time I'd support a small increase to "tide us over" should fees go ballistic.
And having said all of that, I agree that Mr. V. Is off-base as well. Trying to be a swami and predict the future of Bitcoin is simply impossible. If you guess enough you'll be right twice s day, but we'll all be better served by being scientists rather than Taro card readers and operate a concensus driven OODA loop: Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.
Nobody can really predict much. We must learn a lot and be very cautious to not screw up something which is amazingly resilient, but extremely poorly understood. :-)

I’ve never heard anyone claim gold doesn’t have utility. I have heard people claim it doesn’t have intrinsic value — and i agree with that.
Bitcoin has utility too, so it’s every bit as absurd to suggest Bitcoin has no utility.
What’s interesting is that Bitcoin’s utility is quite narrow, and limited entirely to transactions on the blockchain.
I believe that gold’s wider utility guarantees a less stable value.
Imagine a new technology comes along that requires a lot of gold, or replaces a substantial portion of gold’s use. The value of gold would fluctuate substantially due to uses outside it’s use case as money.
Add in supply instability due to mining supply fluctuation due to value fluctuation (the higher the price of gold, the more is mined) and gold will, in the future, be less stable than Bitcoin IMHO.
And then there’s the statistical likelihood that the stock of gold will increase dramatically in the next 50 years as the ocean floors begin being mined...

I do. It means people are willing to trade their goods and services for bitcoin. Which is to say they *want* bitcoin. Right now the vast majority of people don't want bitcoin. Yet every time the price rises, more people want it, some of which are vendors.


I never said anything that was contradictory to that statement. If a merchant wants low fees, then they'll love Bitcoin, because the customer pays the fee.
How's that for a kickback?


Yes. I think they're going to get a kickback of about 30¢ + 3% on every plastic purchase. And, of course, they'll benefit on the rising price of Bitcoin -vs- fiat should they keep a few BTC around.

Each exchange has an order book of outstanding orders.
There are 8 basic types of orders:
  1) market buy - will buy at the lowest limit price
  2) market sell - will sell at thr highest limit price
  3) limit buy - will buy at or below limit price
  4) limit sell - will sell at or above limit price
  5) stop buy - converts to market buy at or below stop price
  6) stop sell - converts to market sell at or above stop price
  7) stop limit buy - converts to limit buy at or below stop price
  8) stop limit sell - converts to limit sell at or above stop price
As new orders arrive they're compared to the other orders and traded via a matching engine.
Each trade sets the current market price.
There's a ninth "order type" (which is more of a command IMHO) to cancel an outstanding order.

In that case, I stand corrected.
However, it's also true that Bitcoin's value proposition is enhanced by rising price, as more value can be transacted. :-)
There's no way Bitcoin will maintain a stable value proposition -- particularly so in peoples' minds.
Add in enhancements (Schnorr, Lightning Network, Confidential Transactions, and eventually fully anonymous transactions) and occasional flubs (bugs, outages, scams, sensationalist articles, hard forks, etc.) you can give up on perceived value stability for decades, I think.

I believe the **only** reason retailers don't accept Bitcoin today is the same reason the vast majority of the population doesn't hold any bitcoin:
They simply don't want it ... yet.
I think acceptance will grow it in lockstep with the general population's desire to hold Bitcoin.
Retailers are members of the general population, after all.
If 1% of the population holds Bitcoin, then it'd be unreasonable to expect a significant different percentage of retailers to accept it, as acceptance simply expresses a desire to hold.

You must fill out a complaint form, in triplicate, and submit it to the Bitcoin CFO. :-)
Seriously: no, it's gone unless the entity that controls the address is willing to send it back to you. Bitcoin is *just like* physical cash, precious metals, and precious gems in this respect.
Some things to note:
1) Bitcoin addresses are designed for single use. Don't ever send Bitcoin to an address you've used before unless you *absolute* know what you're doing. All modern wallets will generate a stream of addresses for you when you receive BTC, and spend from those addresses appropriately, representing potentially many addresses in aggregate as a single wallet.
2) Bitcoin addresses have checksum digits prevents most cases of transcription errors. Even so, be careful, thoughtful and precise when transcribing addresses. Prefer copy/paste and QR scanning when at all possible.

Deflation is when the currency supply is reduced -- which often leads to lower prices.
Bitcoin's inflation rate just reduced from around 8% to around 4% at the halvening. The inflation rate is reduced by half every four years.
Bitcoin won't become deflationary until the inflation rate is lower than the rate at which coins are lost and:or are burned (sent to an unspendable address).
Burning seems weird but it's a really interesting way to promote anonymous and/or pseudonymous reputation by literally allowing you and others to "put your money where your mouth is" by anchoring it to sunk value that you and others have invested into your reputation.
Think of it this way: no point in throwing away a $100k lifetime reputation burn to scam someone for less than $100k!
And if burning money "feels" wasteful to you, it isn't. In a limited supply currency any funds that cannot be circulated for any reason, including private key loss, and burning (and perhaps other ways) simply becomes a gift to every other holder, in the amount lost, proportional by the amount each entity holds.

I've been traveling with my family in Europe for 3 weeks with 1 left to go.
In London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Venice, Rome, and Zurich we've had various issues with plastic.
Pins, SMS notifications, failures, emails, etc. thank goodness we had a Visa account with two cards (we've had one go through, but the other not), 3 debit cards, and cash.
We've had to rely on cash and feel exposed when we have none, because sometimes the damn cards just don't work.
We have chip cards, but because they're US, we don't have pins, and it's a hassle for everyone nearly every time we pay because many checkers don't have pens around to sign.
ApplePay has been quite reliable. We were unable to get my wife's Visa in to ApplePay, however. USAA customer service could not finalize the addition because they "have no record of a card with that number" though the card works perfectly and we can see the transactions. Seriously WTF?
Finally, I have a child starting college in the fall. Tuition was due on July 15. I transferred money from an investment firm to my checking account by giving them my routing and account number. Worked just fine.
Then I logged in to Wells Fargo Online to make the transfer. Confusing and obscure documentation, which turned out to be entirely incorrect, wasted an hour. Then the most frustrating two hours in my life were wasted trying to transfer money to the school's account with their routing and account number and finally being told it was impossible unless I was in person at a branch. They have no branches in Rome, so sorry, nothing we can do. It's security, for my benefit, of course...
Called the school. They gave me a URL they use as a last resort. Typed in my routing and account number, and BOOM, transfer complete.
Those two numbers are, essentially, public information! I was forced to give the school complete control over my account! And we've been WFB customers since checks were in common usage, so probably thousands of people have every bit of information required to empty my account on a whim, but WFB won't initiate a transfer on my behalf when I *desperately* need it done because of their stupid security theatre.
What do banks even do besides transmit money to other banks? It's their job! Insane.
The entire time I've been thinking Bitcoin will eventually resolve all of this.
People who say the present system works well are using selective memory.

Not sure what you think that would improve, [blocks are not even full yet.](
I know what I fear: having the network splinter into many forks due to block propagation issues or become less decentralized than it is today.
Does it not bother you that the gigantic boogeyman of the "fee event" and exponentially increasing fees that large block supporters feared -- and said would occur before now -- have not happened? And that the network has continued to operate just as core predicted?
Any sane person knows that there's no certainty about the future. I certainly was nervous that core might be wrong.
But they weren't wrong and the large blockers were wrong. So who are you going to support going forward, the group that predicted a catastrophe and essentially yelled "FIRE!" in a crowded movie theater (when there was no fire) or those who kept a steady hand on the wheel and are working hard to keep Bitcoin headed in the right direction?

That said, it's massively undervalued if it only replaces gold and silver as the leading scarcity based, infrequently transacted, liquid stores of value.

@_date: 2016-07-11 13:26:12
I agree, though Bitcoin may change that as the first scarce asset that has no other use.
Many people argue that having no intrinsic value is a weakness. But that also ignores the intrinsic use-case(s) of naturally occurring currencies "artificially" intruding on the value.
It's possible that fiat currency is/was "better" than naturally occurring currencies for this very reason -- which caused economists to believe that they were economically superior -- as long as they're properly managed. And they may be right, if only they were *ever* properly managed.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, has the advantage of being decentralized, automatically managed, and entirely free from "other" use cases.
Unfortunately, many people are trying to use the blockchain for non-monetary uses -- so perhaps we'll never have a "pure" currency to test this thoroughly.

We weren’t talking about running a node, we were talking about contributing hash rate.
The network doesn’t get to choose which nodes are included, or what their latency is.
Nothing you have said indicates I’m incorrect, or that Bitcoin doesn’t work as I described it.
I suspect that there will be billions of tiny devices contributing hash power in the future.
I hope it works out that way, the security would be incontrovertible in that case.
@_date: 2016-07-10 12:58:50
Every bitcoin in existence was awarded to miners who are responsible for packaging transactions into blocks and forming the cryptographically secured blockchain, which in turn is verified by nodes, and to a lesser extent (though that's intended to improve in the mid-term via fraud proofs) by wallets.
For the first four years miners were awarded 50 BTC per block. For the next four years, 25 BTC per block, as of yesterday, 12.5 BTC per block.
Blocks are generated at statistical 10 minute intervals, sometimes shorter, sometimes longer. During times of increasing security (increasing hash rate) -- as has been the case for nearly the entire existence of Bitcoin -- blocks will be generated more quickly. The opposite is true when security (hash rate) is in decline.
@_date: 2016-07-30 06:51:45
They don't need to "cash out" their BTC.
There's little chance that BTC will substantially increase their income, so their increased fiat expenses from de BTC customers will barely move the needle.
If you have a business than receives $20k/month in income at 50% gross margin and gets 1% of sales in BTC, you could acquire .3 BTC/month for $100/month -- half the exchange rate!
The *only* reasons for a business to take BTC is if they want to accumulate BTC.

What do you base that statement on?
Do you have any small/owner-operated business experience at all?
I've been involved with such businesses since I was 6 years old, and also have experience at SMEs, regional banks, and international corporations.
I created a double-entry accounting API from scratch and understand accounting inside-out, though I'm not a CPA.
There's a vast difference between how things *should* be done, and how they *are* done.
Many, if not most, small/owner-operated businesses have zero formal accounting in place. Saying that doesn't say a thing about how it should be done, but doesn't change the fact that it's a FACT.
It's also a FACT that small/owner-operated businesses outnumber their bigger counterparts by a wide margin, which means that for a large number of merchants, it's ABSOLUTELY TRIVIAL to download a wallet, hang a sign at the cash register, and perhaps, if they're lucky, have someone pay for something in Bitcoin.
The FACT that it's unlikely to happen means that the risk of doing so is very low. Since there's little to zero process involved, if it becomes an issue, they can simply remove the sign and discontinue taking it.
You have NO WAY TO REBUT those factual statements, because they're as true as 1+1=2.

No, that's just not a reasonable statement at all. Since the channel is funded by on chain time locked transactions, no double spending is possible.


That's a wallet UI issue. You're statement is like people saying the internet would fail because PPPoE was a bitch to set up...


It's far more secure, adversarially and otherwise, than any existing payment system.
The way you're using that term can be said of Bitcoin itself, i.e. 51% attack vector means Bitcoin isn't *entirely* adversarially secure.

Yes, it does, when the parameters are part of the consensus, which this is.


I think your proposal is used by developers on a regular basis and is one of many of the tools in their toolkit.
You can only benchmark technical assumptions at the scale of your test network, not the real-world that Bitcoin lives in.
We KNOW that running your own node is difficult and challenging today -- even in places where internet connectivity is plentiful.
No amount of lab testing is going to make that go away. Only a worldwide improvement in network connectivity will make it better in places that have the poorest connectivity.
Lightning Network, however, will make everything about Bitcoin transactions better. They're more private, quicker, cheaper, and have network transit latency confirmation, not the elegant but decided atypical Poisson distribution block timing semantics combined with increasing certainty of each additional block.
Consensus believes STRONGLY that using economics to FORCE efficient transaction construction and second layer protocols are the way forward.
Of course you're welcome to do your own research and attempt to change consensus. ��‍♂️

Depends on your wallet.
RBF (replace by fee) allows you to send a replacement transaction if you’re the sender, as you indicated above. Original transaction must be marked as replaceable for this to work.
CPFP (child pays for parent) allows you to make a new transaction dependent on a transaction sent to you (unconfirmed) with a fee that, added to the original, is enough to confirm both in the same block.

While I'm sure everyone can agree that miners want to protect their profits -- who doesn't? -- I don't believe they've articulated that as a direct concern.
Their argument appears to have three prongs: 1) they prefer the "simpler" traditional block size increase, and 2) they feel that the core group slighted them with respect to the "Hong Kong Agreement" (though only a few members of the core team participated), 3) the core doesn't believe Bitcoin can be sufficiently scaled on-chain and would prefer to scale off-chain via Lightning Network.

It described it’s functionality, and people latched on to a few sentences and misunderstood what they meant.
No matter if it was created with the purpose you describe, however. If Satoshi intended for the world’s transactions to be on chain, that was a colossal mistake.

Price is fundamental.
At the current price Bitcoin is of limited use.
The largest transaction possible or today is for $168B and, of course, far smaller practically as they would require one party to own all of the bitcoin and want to send it all to someone else.
By comparison, that number for gold is $7T, and for USD it’s around $21T.
For Bitcoin to serve as a worldwide currency, each needs to be worth around $4-5M USD or all of the won’t represent enough value to become universal.

Everything has costs. The smaller the business, the lower the costs to receive Bitcoin.
I think I've made it extremely clear that I'm talking about small/owner-operated businesses, yet you refuse to acknowledge the fact that there are MANY of these businesses.
I also pointed out early that other than the business owner/operator desiring to acquire Bitcoin, something a growing number of people are doing these days -- some of which own small businesses -- the only advantage is that of no chargebacks -- which is a HUGE advantage in certain types of business.
Not all businesses operate uniformly. You continuously suggesting they operate monolithically by a single set of rules makes it clear that whatever your experience is, it's NOT on the small end of the spectrum where the owner/operator can do whatever they want.
Businesses are made of people. If the people who own and operate the business want to experiment with Bitcoin, the cost can -- and should be -- very near zero.

It's reasonably possible the transactions are those of the miner itself, or a friend, potentially paid for off-chain.
Many Bitcoin attack scenarios come from miners apparently acting against their apparent self-interest, and it seems to be a recurring blind spot in considering possible scenarios for behavior like this.
For instance, if a miner is willing to forego fee income, they can fill blocks with their own transactions at zero fee -- or from a private mempool of transactions nobody else is privy to -- and possibly paid for out-of-band.

They believe that Bitcoin can scale on-chain and SegWit is an attempt to change the fundamental nature of Bitcoin.
They appear to believe this because the title of the original white paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" implies to them a lot more than the actual words say: that title "makes it clear" that the Bitcoin blockchain was intended to record all Bitcoin economic exchanges.
Mix in a bit of both well-deserved and not-so-well-deserved hero worship of Satoshi, and you have a bit of a religion formed against observable, measurable reality.
The vast majority of people who believe this are, IMNSHO, less than technically proficient.
What's unclear to me is why they cannot see the fantastic value in layer two solutions such as OPENDIME and Lightning Network, both of which allow the settlement of multiple financial exchanges via a single on-chain transaction.

Network latency surely does play a factor, but Bitcoin is worldwide.
Miners are everywhere in the world that power is cheap.
“Everything mining” may not be profitable, particularly now, but the more distributed the better for security purposes.
A few milliseconds per block may indeed be worth optimizing when you’re in the business, but in the 10 minute per block window, a few milliseconds won’t matter as most would probably think of it as a lottery that pays every ten minutes.
Lotteries aren’t economical, but people love gambling and, statistically, most of them lose most of the time.

Remember that every penny they saved would be rising in value as well.
I see less debt, as interest rates will be extremely high, less stress, less uneven wealth distribution (less ability to make money on money), etc.
Wages would only go down when the population increases and at the inverse of the rate it's increasing, whereas the value would rise proportionately to total economic value.
With any luck, we can create value faster than the population increases.
In fact, its already beginning to decrease in first world nations, will probably level out as wealth distribution levels out.

The core team who, as a group, know more about the technical underpinnings of Bitcoin, believe that larger blocks threaten the correct operation of the network until a few critical changes have been made.
I, and many others, agree with them.
Progress is being made on a couple of fronts to support larger blocks without threatening the network's proper operation.
After those changes -- segwit and improved block propagation -- have been made, the core team will increase block size, hopefully through a dynamic system that keeps fees inline with both user and miner expectations.
Should core not more to increase transaction counts, opinion will turn against them.

If by 1MB is magic number you mean it's the current value and is functioning then you're right, it's magical.
Why scale before we understand the behavior of full blocks?
If there are issues -- by which I dont mean people with wallets that are years old and/or not well enough maintained to dynamically set fees -- increasing block size is not hard to do.
On the other hand, increasing the block size before absolutely required could cause issues, and would absolutely limit a unique opportunity we have to learn about edge-case behavior.

This is the best answer.
It doesn't slow the network down at all as this only happens within moments of the last block and before a full block can be mined.
The next block is ALWAYS about ten minutes away, regardless of when the last one was found. If that seems unintuitive, welcome aboard, statistics can be weird. :-)
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:00:06
It may be statistical variance, but it looks like the hash rate is rising rapidly as it's been happening for more than an hour.
The difficulty is adjusted every two weeks, so if hash rate increases between adjustments, the block times will be lower than expected -- as they have been for most of Bitcoin's existence.

Funny you should post that link. I've read it before, essentially pure speculation with great certainty.
Fiat money is relatively new. The examples given are POST central bank fiat usage, a few mild examples are mentioned in earlier times.
Sometimes ideas appear to be irrefutable and are yet simply wrong.


If it were that simple, the Quora examples would have feen easy to fix yet have not been -- yet have been remarkably good at increasing wealth inequality.
Finally, I suspect that inflation and deflation will be a lot different in the Bitcoin economy due to the ease of transacting precisely with great precision.
With fixed unit currencies with a couple of decimal places and poor information flow skewing the results, Bitcoin value increase is likely to come across quite differently than during the pieces-of-eight era.

It relies on more than half of wallets, nodes, and miners to act rationally.
A smaller subset of any, acting irrationally, can cause issues.
One of the worst issues that it's easy to think about the affects of, but always difficult (for me) to consider is that miners can include ANY -- including their own -- or no -- transactions into blocks.
My point is that a miner can makes their blocks any size they want for any reason they choose.

Bitcoin has limited on-chain transaction capacity and is currently backed up a bit.
Transactions are generally (it’s up to each node) processed in order of fee. Your transactions fee appears to be  of 58,327 (at moment of that photo) which means there are 2-3 blocks of transactions ahead of yours at that time.
New transactions are flowing in constantly, and there’s generally no time priority, so it’s impossible to tell when your transaction might be confirmed.
Some wallets support RBF for senders and CPFP for receivers to adjust transaction fees after-the-fact.
This is one reason why retailers and consumers have been slow to adopt Bitcoin for high volume use.
Have no fear! Lightning Network, which is up and running but is still in its infancy eliminates this specific problem entirely, lowers fees dramatically, and increases privacy as well.

Same as all other currencies?
Bitcoin appears more public, but fiat has serial numbers and cash machines are scanning bills inserted and dispensed, so fiat cash is becoming more traceable.
Since Bitcoin transactions are between random "account IDs" which are only used once (with a good wallet) and those random IDs can be (but frequently aren't) generated without attached human identities, Bitcoin transactions can be (but frequently aren't) created with no ties to a human identity.

Bitcoin is a VOLUNTARY, universal world-wide value standard (like gold), apolitical, preordained monetary policy (unlike fiat currencies), and censorship resistant (anyone can make any transaction they want, nobody can freeze funds).


Bitcoin is a like a small cork floating on the world's ocean of fiat currencies. It will remain volatile until: 1) its value goes to zero, 2) it is the largest store of value.
If you think about it, there's absolutely no way a brand-new, voluntary currency could created and not be volatile. It's value *must* start at zero and *may* increase. If it does increase, as Bitcoin has, then it will be volatile as *any* change is volatility.
In fact, volatility is what one of the things that is allowing Bitcoin to grow at the moment, just as censorship resistance was (is?) relied upon during the Silk Road days.

Because it's difficult to run a full node in that it should be on full-time, needs port-forwarding enabled and configured on NAT-enabled routers (the vast majority), and is not-inexpensive in that it consumes a fair amount of disk space (though only a few $ in magnetic HD storage, many systems now ship with relatively small SSD disks) and consumes a fair amount of bandwidth.
And this is why SegWit + Lightning Network supporters want to scale off-chain, so the number of nodes does not decrease further as the cost of running them increases with on-chain transactions.

Bitcoin is treated as any other capital good under US law.
I buy Bitcoin with post-tax dollars.
The only time I'd need to disclose anything about them, short of new laws, of course, is when I convert them to another asset.
At that time they may fall under 1031 rules (investment exchange), or be treated as capital gains/losses.
It's unlikely I'll do either of those things in the next 5-7 years, as I'm a HODLER.

You're welcome!


Mostly how many input addresses and output addresses the transaction requires. To be clear: a one input, two output transaction (probably the most common?) should cost the same amount whether it moves .001 BTC to 1,000 BTC.


Unfortunately, no. Bandwidth, CPU and storage all scale up as transaction count increases.
But the VAST MAJORITY of the energy required to mine a block is not proportional to the size of the block as measured by neither binary size, transaction count, nor value transacted.


The rewards are per-block, one block every 10ish minutes. The reward is currently 12.5 BTC per block. It'll drop by half to 6.25 in a bit less than 3ish years.
There are transaction fees that will become a larger and larger share of miner revenue as the block reward decreases. The miner who mines a block gets both the block reward and transaction fees for the block.
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:44:23


You shouldn't, and that's why many people here, myself included, recommending HODLing.
As the value of Bitcoin rises, and the amount of value the world is willing to hand you for your Bitcoin rises, you're absolutely going to be tempted to spend some of that Bitcoin. Say you invested $1,000 in 2010, and it's now a TON, might you sell a TINY AMOUNT of what you hold for a new car, or if you invested $10,000 then, a new house?
Which is to say that as the value rises exponentially, you will be tempted to spend exponentially smaller amounts to your advantage.
So, the transaction rate will increase as the value increases, making more people aware of it, increasing the price, etc. which all feeds back into the value of Bitcoin.
As that value continues to rise, more and more people will realize "Damn, I guess I was wrong about Bitcoin. I want to get ahold of some."
Some of those people will be merchants. It's easy for them to collect Bitcoin. They can just side-stream a transaction here, another there, for Bitcoin. It's a small audience, so it's not like 10% of their income is going to become Bitcoin overnight, but they might manage to shift .01% of their income in a year to Bitcoin -- and do so without signing up for an exchange or taking any more action than downloading a wallet.
And then they can demonstrate their tech-savvy to their low-tech acquaintances at the next cocktail party. :-)
The price cannot rise forever. If it took over 100% of the fiat currency, gold and silver over the next 30 years (at a linear rate) Bitcoin would need to rise over $1,000/day for the entire time. But at that time, the value of Bitcoin will be fixed to human value creation, which seems to increase by about 4% per year -- about the rate that central banks would like to inflate in an effort to stabilize the value of the currency.


That is tricky. For a long time, people will prefer to price in fiat. Should Bitcoin continue it's growth, there will be a time when fiat value is less stable than Bitcoin.
Consider the fact that the British pound depreciated by over 13% following Brexit. Few menus were changed overnight, but you better believe that anyone selling anything made in part or in whole by a vendor who prefers other currencies is absolutely going to need to update their menu eventually!

We (HODLers) pay them (via the block reward) to provide the proof of work to secure the network.
We also pay them per transaction (via transaction fees) to be included in a block.


Originally there was not A distinction between nodes and miners, so all miners used to run nodes. Many still do, though pools provide nodes to their hash participants.
Anyone who transacts large values of Bitcoin should run a node to validate transactions themselves. Nodes provide resiliency and validate all transactions to make keep everyone else honest.

Empty blocks don't have anything to do with ASICBOOST, as far as I can tell.
It's all about hashing something during the time between finding one block, and having it confirmed by others.
Since you need to know both what the previous block is, and what the block you're hashing on is, and both must be valid, it makes sense to hash an empty block between the time one block is found and it is confirmed by the wider network.
At most ASICBOOST -- which is horrible in-and-of-itself -- makes this easier, the same as it makes hashing any block easier.

And the miners are blocking SegWit. No conspiracy in that, but there's no difference between voting and blocking.
The code is out in the wild, on the vast majority of nodes. Miners are the reason fees are high right now.

And that's exactly what answered.
Each node is a full mirror of the blockchain.
They all work together to make sure they're all on the same page.
They do this by transmitting messages on a peer-to-peer network.
So the network you're talking about IS composed entirely of mirrors run by each node.
Hope that makes sense. If not, ask some questions and I'll try to answer.

The Bitcoin proof-of-work system is fundamentally built around the idea that hashing is a uniformly distributed algorithm, i.e. 1 CPU = 1 vote.
Of course, it was understood that faster CPUs could hash faster than slow CPUs. Even so, generally speaking, fast CPUs require more power than slow CPUs, so total work, as measure by energy input, would be pretty evenly distributed.
GPUs were more efficient than CPUS, and places in the world where energy was cheaper had an advantages, but those advantages are available fairly equally to anyone willing to move and invest capital.
ASICs at first seemed similar to GPUs until ASIC manufacturers realized they could make more money mining with their ASICs than selling the ASICs to others. I honestly cannot figure why Antminer and BitFury sell ASICs to others -- though I'm happy they do. I'd love to know what percentage they keep -vs- sell, though.
Anyway, those miners who made the ASICs have had a structural monopoly building. They can acquire hashing equipment cheaper than anyone else, which makes them more profitable, which allows fast growth, and they ALSO get a portion of every other miners income because those miners have to buy their ASICs!
That's an issue in itself, though it'll eventually self-correct when BIG capital starts pouring into mining. Bitcoin could be a small fish in a big pond should Intel, AMD, Apple or NVidia choose to release hashing hardware. God forbid one of those choosing to mine on their own! ��
But that all pales compared to ASICBOOST, particularly patented ASICBOOST. It's a substantial reduction in the work required to hash a block, something unanticipated by Satoshi and Core. It's equivalent to someone substantially weakening a hash algorithm (as happened to MD5) but being the only entity in the world that can use it.
But the worst part of ASICBOOST was ethical position demonstrated by those involved with it. A Bitcoin security exploit is a very serious matter. Hashing is fundamental to Bitcoin security. Security holes must be eliminated or they WILL be exploited! Yet the ASICBOOST group decided to secretly exploit the vulnerability rather than reveal it so the vulnerability could be corrected.
In that respect it's not far removed from discovering and exploiting a security issue that would allow someone to steal coins. Core has found and fixed a ton of those sorts of issues without secretly benefiting from them. The ASICBOOST crew chose another path -- one that I do not support and do not wish to see them use to their economic advantage.

Sorry for being super unclear.
The seed words are, essentially, the key.
Writing them down negates some of the security of the hardware wallet, as it’s purpose is to never allow the key to leave the device.
My suggestion: get multiple hardware wallets. Use the same seed on all of them. Set a good PIN and passphrase on both. Spread the devices around geographically. Never write down the seed.

Do  yourself a favor and invest it weekly in regular intervals and Euro amounts over the next 10-25 weeks.
It's possible this isn't the optimal final outcome, but neither is going in all-at-once.
If you buy over time, you'll feel less threatened and be less likely to pull out entirely should the price drop quickly. In fact, once you get into the habit, you'll be happy if/when the price drops because you'll be able to buy more BTC when the price is lower.

Do you understand that before RBF, you could double spend and get the same behavior as with RBF, but with absolutely no way for the receiver to know this might happen, and that there was no way to reliably change the fee of a transaction?

Since it attained value, BTC has risen more than it has fallen.
Many people have chosen to acquire BTC. One way for merchants to do so is to sell their products for BTC.
It's not a huge risk, because it's highly unlikely that even 1% of purchasers will choose to use BTC, so it's not as though it's a make-it-or-break-it decision.
The low percentage of buyers goes to two reasons: BTC holders are unlikely to part with their BTC, and not many people hold BTC.

@_date: 2017-06-08 07:39:27
No, they think that the value of Bitcoin is its decentralization, and running if running a node is expensive, it will be less decentralized and, therefore, less valuable.
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:45:08
It's simple: supply and demand.
The supply is well understood. The number of coins for sale *should* decrease when price is rising: more people buying, more people holding.
Bitcoin is an extraordinarily scarce item. No matter how high the demand, the long term supply doesn't increase, and the short term supply has rarely been increased more than low double-digit percentages, and even that resets every two weeks, so it's minimal overall.
Other than dead-artist artworks, which few people have any first-hand market experience, there are very few items as scarce as Bitcoin.
I believe this will continue to surprise the markets for quite some time.

You're not the first.
Several wallets allowed users to display in whatever units they wished, then removed the "feature" because it was causing havoc for support as people accidentally sent incorrect amounts and were confused when they received amounts they thought were incorrect.
Bitcoin has tons of usability issues, just as the internet did in the early days.

It is an exploit to the cryptographic underpinnings of Bitcoin security. It allows users to "cheat" Proof of Work.


I did not. The issue is with ASIC manufactures mining with their own hardware.
It's OK though. Bitcoin can and will throw out the current PoW system should it need to. UASF may be the first step toward doing that very thing.


No company in Bitcoin could possibly be considered risk-averse.
You should not speak of companies as a group any more than you should speak of people as a group. They, and we, are individuals. To the extent that you see companies behaving similarly has more to do with radically uneven wealth distribution (a shocking small per engage of people own most of everything) than the way companies operate as a whole.

When you send a transaction, the Bitcoin network propagates it peer-to-peer to the nodes.
Each node receives it separately, it's not guaranteed that every node gets it, nodes operate independently and don't need to accept every transaction, etc.
Until a miner chooses the transaction, places it into a block, finds the hash, broadcasts the block, and it gets verified, the transaction is subject to change.
So it's absolutely possible for the money spent by that transaction to be spent in another transaction, perhaps with a higher fee (so more likely to be placed into a block) which will make the first transaction invalid.
Hope that helps.

Good question!
With respect to transaction validation, no, each node is considered equal.
Miners are those who package the transactions. As such, they are weighted, through frequency of opportunity to package a block, by the amount of work they're willing to put into securing the system against attack.
Miners themselves run nodes, so I suppose you could say that their nodes have great weight, but they're limited in their actions unless they are not, themselves, motived to earn and HODL bitcoin, i.e. they're not economically aligned with the rest of the nodes. This type of malicious miner is often described as a nation-state or multi-national corporation which is motivated to destroy Bitcoin.
When a single miner is alone doing more than 50% of the work they themselves become a potential attacker -- which is why many people here are very focused at doing everything possible to keep Bitcoin decentralized.

@_date: 2017-06-17 07:11:03
There are 3 broad constituencies in Bitcoin: miners, node operators, and wallets.
Exchanges have their say as node operators. Since they **must** follow their customers to stay in business, they have zero freedom of action to take non-consensus action as to do so would be committing economic suicide.
Developers are the well-recognized technical experts of the group. You can talk about understanding Bitcoin, but if you haven't had a pull-request accepted, written a wallet -- or any other piece of software that runs against the network -- you simply cannot match the understanding of the ramifications a particular change would have on the part of the code that you've helped improve, let alone that of someone who has improved it many dozens, hundreds or even more than a thousand times for highest commit count contributor (Wladimir) to Bitcoin Core. Yet developers have as little freedom -- and a lot more on the line! After all, if the network malfunctions, the developers ARE responsible.
All of us, together, use and/or develop the software that operates the network, or operates against it. We all have a shared and frequently vested (i.e. we're HODLers) interest in Bitcoin's success.
We're all aligned by the growing evidence of the historical significance of what we're participating in.
Bitcoin is **not** a little idea. It's an economic, psychological and sociological wrecking ball ripping through the early days of the 21st century.
Are we, as a group, going to write ourselves out of that story by being unable to get a clear majority moving in a concerted fashion?
I don't think so.
The pressure is building rapidly to break the impasse. You can see it everywhere. The community is frantic to move forward.

It's not a non-sequitur.
Interest rates would certainly net out the difference between fiat inflation and Bitcoin increase in value. Even once Bitcoin stabilizes, there's still the difference between inflation rates.
Then there's the additional risk of non-repayment as Bitcoin value rises, making it harder to repay.
Finally, I suspect interest rates will rise when lenders are required to work for the money they lend.

And yes, properly disclosed and freely shared, ASICBOOST is less of a threat yet also not an efficiency.
ASICBOOST proves that the current PoW algorithm is flawed. Flaws can fan out into larger consequences. Flaws in cryptography should always be corrected or they will almost certainly be exploited in one or more ways.
It's not what we know about ASICBOOST today that concerns me. It's how the flaw may lead to further exploits that demand it be corrected, and it's secret exploiters be unmasked as the unethical thieves that they are.

The reason we *need* fees today, given that blocks are generally full, is to determine which transactions get into blocks.
It's worth noting that if block size had increased before blocks were full, the operational readiness of the network, and every single piece of software that uses the Bitcoin protocol, would be *far* less mature than it is today.
Imagine if Bitcoin use were 100x what it is today, but had never run into full blocks. Then imagine blocks filled during a transaction spike.
It would be absolute mayhem compared to what's happening today.

Early birds get the margin, and margins provide distribution.
If BTMs were not a "huge rip off" (your words, not mine) they wouldn't be worth the risk of purchasing them, leasing the space, etc.
If you don't think they're risky, ask the folks who bought machines in 2013 and have since gone out of business.
When the risk goes down, the margins will follow -- likely dropping out the bottom when existing ATM operators upgrade their units to handle BTC.

In US public school in the 70s I was taught that the English expected to "us" to fight in the European manner: lines of people, an agreement between generals on the battlefield, etc.
Instead, we were hiding everywhere, picking them off one at a time.
I honestly have no idea whether this is true or not. It does strike me the way "we" characterize largely middle-eastern "terrorists" today: not fighting "fair."
But the R3 members, Japan's group, Linux Foundation, this new Chinese organization...all appear to be lining up in the traditional manner, unable to understand that the rules have changed, ready to fight the old battles.
It doesn't mean they'll lose -- whatever that means -- but they're clearly playing a much shorter game then Satoshi was.
Classic strategy -vs- tactics. A combination of both is most likely to win.

Inflation is an increase the supply of currency. Since an increase in the money supply frequently results in rising prices (due to a lowering of the value of the currency itself) the term inflation is frequently used to describe rising prices.
What's happening in Bitcoin is neither inflation nor deflation (reducing the supply of currency), but is price discovery of the new asset class of cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin may be viewed as inflating at around 4%/year (the amount of Bitcoin currently in circulation) or completely stable (since we know there will eventually be 21M total).
There may come a time in the future when Bitcoin becomes deflationary due to keys lost or coins burned (which in both cases takes them out of circulation).
I think it's super unfortunately that the terms inflation and deflation have become conflated with rising prices/lowering prices, because those terms are orthogonal -- though frequently correlated.
Hope that helps.

Gold's UI is fixed, Bitcoin's is not.

@_date: 2017-06-24 19:48:34
I apologize for the delayed response. You made some good points and I needed some time to think it through.
I believe there are fundamental differences that will cause Bitcoin denominated loans to have higher interest rates than fiat.
You said interest rates track inflation. This is absolutely true for fiat, despite concerns about how inflation is measured, particularly with respect to common usage of inflation as "CPI increase" -- which I think is completely bogus. Nevertheless, your statement is not incorrect -- in the centrally managed and controlled fiat space.
From this point forward, I will define inflation as an increase of the currency units -- without regard to currency value or goods and services pricing.
1) Bitcoin, despite being either slightly deflationary (due to private key inaccessibility) or inflationary (due to present 4%ish increase in supply due to mining) depending on how you prefer to measure supply (total supply -vs- in circulation) is rapidly appreciating in value. This should tend to increase default rates on loans, particularly as lenders and borrowers adjust. Higher default rates tend to increase interest rates.
2) Being permissionless, and censorship resistant, will IMHO, tend to increase borrower fraud. Get the loan, vanish with the Bitcoin, mix it, move on to next victim. With Bitcoin, the lender protection of court ordered paycheck attachments are over. This increases lender risk, which tends to increase rates.
3) Rising value of Bitcoin reduces the desire/risk to put cash to work. With fiat, cash value decreases which tends to raise the risk tolerance of lenders. With Bitcoin, cash value increases which tends to lower the risk tolerance of lenders. This is huge as it's not subtly different than fiat, it's 180 degrees opposite.
4) As most lending is performed by banks, which create money at near zero cost, there's little downside to lending at below risk adjusted rates. I cannot back this with evidence, but I believe Bitcoin will certainly show that current banking policy to be biased toward understating risk in that it is substantially centrally controlled via the prime rate and, as such, likely under considerable political impact -- particularly when so many governments around the world have serious debt issues that would be radically worse in a rising interest rate environment.

Hello Matt.
Good for you! Dive in an experience it yourself. So many of your colleagues have sat by the sidelines and pontificated...
To learn about the broad scope, and understand why (many) people are so deeply motivated by Bitcoin, I'd recommend [this]( article.
What I explain to folks who are interested is that Bitcoin (BTC) is, first and foremost, a protocol, like email (SMTP) or the web (HTTP), which runs atop the internet (TCP/IP).
TCP/IP allows data to flow freely around the globe. Everything the internet does it does via TCP/IP. It surpassed all other means of global data exchange.
SMTP allows peer-to-peer message delivery. It surpassed traditional means of message delivery.
HTTP allowed information to freely flow, and applications to freely operate around the globe. It surpassed traditional means of information exchange and application delivery.
BTC allows value to freely flow around the globe. It is in its infancy and, many believe, will surpass traditional means of value exchange.
A *perfect* example of this is [the football guy]( He held up a sign and $24k+ flowed into his Bitcoin wallet. That is something *that could not happen* without BTC.
The truth is, BTC is so fundamental we don't really know where it leads. But once you've completed a purchase of BTC, which will undoubtedly cause you to interact with the banking system, you'll quickly understand that all the pain in buying Bitcoin is caused by the banking infrastructure and relieved by Bitcoin itself.
The banking industry and its infrastructure are direct descendants of gold bullion being shipped around the planet in strong boxes, guarded by guns. Compared to that, a letter of credit delivered by Pony Express was a big step up in moving value around.
But Bitcoin is a ground up reinvention. The Bitcoin network is non-centralized, publicly accessible, enormously secure, and based upon computer science and mathematics.
Truth is, money doesn't flow easily today, just as data, information, and messages didn't flow freely before the internet. Bitcoin solves this *entirely* and is why folks who are into Bitcoin believe it to be revolutionary.
The existing banks are bringing knives to a gunfight.
P.S. Thanks for spreading the word. Here's some [cash]( to use on your adventure!

For starters, ETFs aren't know for being particularly volatile.
And these sentences?




It appears to me that it's about HALF as volatile as the leveraged gold ETF, that Bitcoin is just nearing it's highest volatility in the last several years, that the ETF in question just happens to be near it's lowest volatility in the last couple of years.
Which is to say, looking at that chart, the OBVIOUS conclusion is that Bitcoin is far less volatile than that ETF.

Your experience as a non-technical early adopter is a sign that we technical early-adopters (though I'm a late-phase early adopter myself, only been here a few months) are onto something really, really big.
I remember telling people how important the internet was in the early 90's. Many people didn't get it. I'd tell them "when it's as important to you as it is to me, it'll be huge." :-)
BTC isn't as important to me today as the internet was to me then, but it's every bit as important to the early guys as the internet was to me, and I imagine they've been thinking and telling people the same thing as I did back then.
At the end of the day, the critical fact is that Bitcoin is HIGHLY CREATIVE. Creativity is the fountain of value. Therefore, I believe, Bitcoin is going to be highly valuable.
