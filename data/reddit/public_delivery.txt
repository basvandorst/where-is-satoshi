wut if you are implying that socialism is better, I don't know what to tell you. Capitalism is the reason why humanity has had so much prosperity.
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:25:52
wait, another question. Do I have to live there for half the year? Do they actually check on you?
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:44:34
yea definitely. What about Monaco?
@_date: 2018-12-26 02:02:49
I love it!
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:33:49


Well that goes to the same that not all Catholics support pedophilia.
@_date: 2018-12-26 02:02:56
shut up
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:21:13
that is the exact opposite of Christianity.
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:32:35
we are. Christian socialism is Satanism.
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:05:09


no they don't. Governments infringe on private property every day with their monopoly to tax and coerce us. They have a monopoly on judicial services, defense services, and the law. They are a monopoly and are the antithesis to private property protection.
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:48:36


It still seems very Orwellian though. Those supposed "extreme" right wing people are moderates in comparison to today's radical leftists/Satanists.
I favor voluntary association, but when something like the Crony Mastercard wants to ban people because of ideology, I have to say that is Orwellian. It is corporatism and fascism at its finest. it is the corporate-fascist state at work.

If the relatives have the right to execute the other person, that is the same as slavery. 


If you read the article instead of throwing straw mans at me.
@_date: 2018-12-26 17:11:39
Nope, the Bible says that voluntarily buying slaves is justified, if the slaves committed some crime before hand.
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:21:34
that is privacy, which is a feature of private property rights.
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:03:42
really!??!?!? Dude can you show me a link?
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:43:04
got it.
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:39:35
don't worry. taxation is theft.
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:33:29
that property tax tho.  Also, federal income taxes. New Hampshire should secede from the USSA tyrannical gov. we should become like Monaco
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:34:07
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:42:57


Why do you have a more inherent right to your house/apartment than me? Because you acquired it voluntarily.
Your hypothesis is partly true. Property rights can be voluntarily agreed upon. people who violate them are considered criminals. You did not voluntarily acquire them.


? So you think that an entity that goes to your house to get your income is not coercion?
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:17:32
agreed u/Ichabodblack is an idiot
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:55:41
lol what are those people talking about. Fucking einstein shit going on up there  ������
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:24:07
yep, exactly what I said. If someone murders, the someone should be the property of the victim's family. The victims family should be able to do whatever they want with the someone.
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:03:19


In an economy where the state intervenes in every part of the industry, I would doubt if any big corporation doesn't have ties with the state. We live in corporatism, not capitalism, or commercialism. 


Well many of the left's social values, like pedophilia, are in direct contradiction with the Bible. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:16:06
wait but isn't it super undeveloped?
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:44:18


The sharing of knowledge is not the same as building something. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:52:22
God awards those who believe in him
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:29:49
If you read the piece, and I have read your quotes, it said nothing of a conquered nation. It said you can buy slaves from other countries, and this is inline with the punishment and proportionality of natural law.
You have knowledge of computers, but not in natural law :)
@_date: 2018-12-26 02:02:03
So you think that a young woman who voluntarily acquires a small apartment should let any supposed commie in?
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:54:24
haha. No we aren't. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:52:54


Can you elaborate on that? Private property must be defended by force, otherwise it would be unfair to the victim. Imagine a woman who got here house trashed by a bunch of commies. She must have the right to defend her property, which is implied in private property rights. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:46:37
private property defended through voluntary organizations is the solution
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:13:50
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:28:38
Wow! We truly live in an Orwellian society. Orwell would be rolling in his grave if he knew about this.
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:13:35


It seems to be. The MSM and Good Morning America seem to honor 10 year old boy drag queens. That boy, Dresdon, danced at a gay bar for horny men.


There has been a lot of propaganda to discredit the Church. I'm personally not a Catholic, but just what I have read.


The Bible supports punishment slavery. For example, if a murderer kills a person, that person's family should be able to enslave him or have him/her executed. That is just and fair for the victim and his/her family. Rape would get the death penalty.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:37:42
Hopefully we can change society before that happens. Implement anarcho capitalist model that would ensure private property rights and justice!
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:14:21
yea, I want to get a Georgian Bank account. Chase Bank is controlled by the Rockefellers, who control the U.S. Federal gov.
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:19:24
God is actually real though. There is like tons of empirical evidence out there. 
Also, Christianity built Western Civilization. Latin Christendom.  It paved the way for the Industrial Revolution.
Btw, moral relativism is very shitty. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:20:12
**thats why we need anarcho capitalism**
@_date: 2018-12-26 18:19:29
read this
"Matthew 20:1-16: “For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went. Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day?’ They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.’ So when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers and give them their wages, beginning with the last to the first.’ And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius. But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received each a denarius. And when they had received it, they complained against the landowner, saying, ‘These last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.’ But he answered one of them and said, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as to you. Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? Or is your eye evil because I am good? So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.”
It never ceases to amaze me when Socialists sometimes try to claim that Jesus was some sort of proto-Socialist or Communist. Anyone who is the least bit familiar with the Socialists’ attitude toward such matters would know that the typical Socialist response to such a landowner’s actions towards his workers would be to scream bloody murder! Of course, a Socialist government’s response to such a land owner would be to exterminate him. Yet here Jesus reinforces the correctness of the libertarian creed on the absoluteness of lawfully being able to do what one wishes with their own possessions, as well as being able to freely and voluntarily contract said possessions as one sees fit–even if doing so greatly upsets others! So long as one has kept one’s word in the contracts in which one has agreed to–and so long as one’s actions pertain to their own property–then the right of the individual to make decisions concerning their property remains absolute!
Greatness is in Serving
One of the things which most clearly demonstrates just how different Jesus’s Kingdom is to be from the mortal, Earthly kingdoms and governments–and also why we should be very careful to never confuse the two together–is given in the story of when the apostles James and John came to Jesus asking if they may have the favor granted to them of being able to sit on either side of Jesus’s throne, one to the right and the other to His left, and this is how Jesus answered them:
Mark 10:42-45: But Jesus called them to Himself and said to them, “You know that those who are considered rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant. And whoever of you desires to be first shall be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.” (See also Matt. 18:4; 20:25-28 Mark 9:35; Luke 22:26.)
How diametrically opposite the Kingdom of Christ is indeed from that of the mortal, Earthly governments! Thus, when it is claimed herein that Jesus is an “anarchist” it needs to be born in mind that this is in relation to how all mortal governments on Earth have operated. If one wishes to refer to the “Government of Christ” or the “Kingdom of Christ” this is fine so long is one realizes that the Government of Christ will in no sense be an actual government as they exist on Earth and are controlled by mortals.
It needs to also be pointed out here that above in Mark 10:42 Jesus rebukes the supposed “authority” of the Earthly “rulers”! Thus He says of them “You know that those who are considered rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them”–here is clear proof that just because mortals on Earth may consider someone to be a “ruler” does not mean that God considers them to be genuine rulers! In the eyes of God, those who are the greatest among men are those who seek to serve their fellow men, not those who seek to be served by their fellow men!
Slaves Obey Your Masters?
While although not directly related to the issue of the ethical status of government per se, some individuals have asserted that certain statements in the New Testament by Paul and Peter condone the institution of slavery, and for this reason it is important as it concerns social relations in general. Thus:
Ephesians 6:5-9: Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ; not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men, knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free. And you, masters, do the same things to them, giving up threatening, knowing that your own Master also is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him.
Colossians 3:22-4:1: Bondservants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God. And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ. But he who does wrong will be repaid for what he has done, and there is no partiality. Masters, give your bondservants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
1 Timothy 6:1,2: Let as many bondservants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and His doctrine may not be blasphemed. And those who have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brethren, but rather serve them because those who are benefited are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.
Titus 2:9,10: Exhort bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not answering back, not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.
1 Peter 2:18-25: Servants, be submissive to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh. For this is commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering wrongfully. For what credit is it if, when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? But when you do good and suffer, if you take it patiently, this is commendable before God. For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:
“Who committed no sin,
Nor was deceit found in His mouth”;
who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously; who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness–by whose stripes you were healed. For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
But to quote the above passages as condoning the institution of slavery, one would thereby be confusing the offering of pragmatic advice on how to best handle a bad situation as granting the rightness of that situation. Yet obviously Peter and Paul didn’t so regard the institution of slavery as being at all just, for then there would have been no cause for Peter compare the slave’s suffering to that of Jesus in 1 Peter 2:21-25–as certainly any true Christian regards the scourging and execution of Jesus to have been unjust, to say the very least. Thus the fact that Peter did compare the slave’s suffering to that of Jesus is by itself enough to demonstrate that he considered it to be unjust.
So what of the actual ethical status of the institution of slavery as it concerns Jesus’s own teachings? On this question there can be no doubt, as one of the main reasons Jesus came was to call us to liberty! Jesus said this Himself as recorded in Luke 4:16-21:
