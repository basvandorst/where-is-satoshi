No, we don't need any regulation regarding what an exchange can or cannot say. We've made it this far without it, and I'd argue that it has been for the best as it forces investors (I use that term lightly) to actively educate themselves.

Technically, I don't believe any store can accept credit cards and stay within the payment processor agreement while charging a service fee. Part of the deal Visa, MC, Amex, and Discover have is that merchants have to accept cards the same as cash. I see a lot of merchants not adhere to this and I always report them. I know it sucks for them, but it's bullshit and my expectation is that I am going to pay the same to use a card, as cash. Otherwise any rewards I receive are null and void.
If they don't like it, they shouldn't accept cards at all, or increase their prices across the board to account for the Tx fees.

Many of the problems attributed to capitalism are simply the result of too much government intervention that directly or indirectly favors corporations and the owner class. 
Giving the government more power and mandates is not going to solve shit. The government needs to have its priorities changed to favor individual humans over legal "persons."
Capital can be more equitably distributed via smart legal/tax frameworks that incentivize working class ownership and punitive tax rates on excessive capital gains rather than via income and value add.

Death penalties for illegal immigration--for both the immigrants and any business owner(s) that employee them over American citizens. 
You'd see wages go up 50-100% immediately.
Why do we need over 160,000 H1B visa foreign high tech workers? It's absolutely a lie that companies can't find skilled Americans to do the jobs. They just don't want to pay real wages. Meanwhile, corporate profits are at historical record highs. And wage growth continues to stagnate at levels not seen for 60 or more years.
It is literally the huge amount of illegal and legal, but unnecessary underpaid labor flooding the market. I can't speak for everyone, but if I could have got a job at a meat factory for $25/hr in college, I would have. Instead, Purdue is perfectly content subcontracting the jobs to smaller companies willing to hire illlegal labor for $5 an hour.
But prices would go up! Sure, they may go up marginally, but I can guarantee they could not rise to the point that it would match or outpace the new, real wages. Owners would have to simply lower profit margins, or face competition eating their market share.
@_date: 2019-03-31 22:55:15
Yep, military spending and entitlement spending both need to be cut by 50% or more.
Also, you should only be eligible for government services and entitlements if you're a US citizen. Right now, we pay to support 30-40 million illegal and legal immigrants, all the while the illegal immigrants rarely pay their fair share in taxes to the government.
We need a new capital gains based progressive tax. Your first million in cap gains is tax-free, but if you make millions/billions, tax it up to 75%
In the process we can lower income taxes. This allows working class Americans to get up to a million tax free for retirement or selling a profitable business, and progressively taxed from there, all the while punishing hedge funders, execs, and others that siphon wealth and pay tax rates lower than working class folks. It could also help prevent situations like Amazon getting a negative tax rate.
Even better, I'd love to see a tax deduction incentive for companies that provide equity to their employees as part of their compensation packages. If employees got a piece of the company they work for, no matter if it was public or private, or their role in the company, there would there be an increase in productivity. Knowing you own a piece of the company you work for can do wonders for encouraging hard work and loyalty.
Right now we have got to move away from the old ways of thinking and try something new, with more focus on the working class, and less for owners...but not by marching toward state-led socialist policies.

You're right. The remainder of pain won't finish playing out until 1Q or 2Q 2019, then it's probably safe to buy in for the slow rise. However, I suspect money will be better spent in a couple of the quality alts rather than hoarding as much BTC as possible. I see BTC dominance being slowly chipped away as folks realize crypto is here to stay, but others have demonstrably better tech and use. Like the NASDAQ crash of 2000, it could easily take a decade or more for the broader cryptocurrency market to reach previous highs, BTC being like MSFT catching up after the fact, while some of its "competitors" boom in the meantime. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:50:42
If you bought Microsoft at the top of the 2000 tech bubble, it would have taken you nearly 15 years to turn a profit on that investment, discounting dividends and inflation. Accounting for them, it still would have taken over a decade. And if you sold at the most recent peak, you'd be up about 150% at best....after 18 fucking years. 
But people all the time would cry until they're blue in the fact that MSFT is a great investment. And maybe they're right. If you DCA'd and held, you'd be doing alright. Nothing like some of us BTC folks, or an early NFLX investor, but alright. 
BTC will be fine. The crypto market needed this. Too much noise in the form of terrible altcoins. The next few years are gonna be the proving grounds for what is legit and useful. And those winners are going to hit price levels we can't fathom, thanks to widespread adoption and use. And then will come relative stability and the easy gains gone, as crypto becomes taken for granted as just a part of life.

I'm still up over 11,000% after selling near the peak, paying off $60k debt, averaging back in with monthly buys to BTC LTC ETH XMR and BAT for the last 8 months, with another wad of cash on the side waiting to catch the bottom in the $1800-2500 area, which will turn me into a multi-millionaire within the next decade at the latest.
Everyone said the same hilarious shit when I began accumulating BTC years ago, and continued to trash me when I was buying LTC at $4 and ETH at $11.

I spend btc/ltc/eth fairly frequently, at least compared to your average crypto user, I'd say. Usually find something that I want to purchase that accepts crypto once or twice per month. I think bear markets are the best time to use it as currency, as I'll typically replenish what I spent at a lower price than I purchased. 
Never been a hardcore hodler. Always used it as currency since I began accumulating in 2015. And I sell significant chunks during multibagger spikes.

Yep. One of the biggest mistakes I ever made was during my first foray into the stock market in 2007. I quickly learned to go short, made huge gains on my account through 2009. Stayed decidedly pessimistic, bought into the global economic collapse meme, and never went long with my gains. Instead, emotionally held on to my silly beliefs and missed out on the best moments of the longest stock bull in history. Also, because I was so burned on stocks by mid 2010, I completely discounted BTC as pennystock-tier fraudulent hype, although I was admittedly intrigued. Decided my money (and time that could have been used mining) was better spent elsewhere. Kicked myself when I witnessed the 2013 run, and finally began purchasing at the bottom of 2015. 
While crypto has since helped make up for the opportunity cost of my bad decisions between 2009 and 2015, I would be a literal multimillionaire if I had just gone 100% long on stocks and BTC when I was feeling the exact opposite. 
These days, I'm far more realistic about things and patient. Slowly accumulate, trade only when the gains defy gravity, and use those gains to slowly reaccumulate and diversify for future growth. Never rely on a black swan, but always try to prepare for the worst.

You might feel like god right now, but it's only a matter of time 'til you blow up your account with that shit. 
If you were so smart, you'd be completely out of stocks by this point, chillin with some boring ass bonds and buying cheap crypto as it bottoms out.
But nah, you'll just kill your account in a handful of silly options trades, over leverage yourself with margin, and start dumping your savings in to hail mary earnings plays that totally wipe you out. It'll take a year or two before you finally admit you fucked up. Seen this over and over. It is the circle of the market.

ĖNo, that's near the end of the cycle prior to or at peak. 
The time to ramp up your purchasing is when half of people think you're an idiot or delusional, and the other half show no interest at all. 2015-2016 i was scoffed at. Fall 2017 I was asked how to buy by the same people that were scoffing. That's when I began selling. 2018 was practically smug haters having a field day as they touted their amazing stock picks. Now I'm buying again, while they are dealing with the first phase of denial before their precious stocks crater 60-70% from the highs. 
I won't laugh at them though. I'll just buy their assets for pennies on the dollar while they're at their lowest. I love cocky 20somethings and desperate boomers/gen Xers. Money spigots for the patient. ��

Yep, a libertarian would say the Civil Rights Act must be repealed because it is a government distortion of markets. There should be no protected classes AT ALL in the eyes of a libertarian. And that's the crux of the issue...these bans are selectively enforced, while certain, government mandated classes enjoy free reign to say and do what they want, and if a business bans them, it's a massive lawsuit and potential criminal punishment.

He's also not taking into account inflation. If we're giving it a 25 year timeframe to reach $1 million, then the value of the dollar is very likely to lose another 30% or so. $18.3 trillion in 2044 would be more like $13 trillion today. Of course, by 2044 we're supposed to be over 20 million BTC mined, correct? But there will also be a better understanding of the number of lost coins and I suspect it is at least 20% of the current supply.
@_date: 2019-05-19 03:23:00
If you use coinbase, i believe the minimum to purchase before the fee changes from 2.99 is $200, so that is the minimum I'd auto-contribute for maximum fee value.
If you did $10, 30% of your investment would be eaten by fees. Bad idea. You would have to sell at a 30% higher price to make a profit. Too much math.

Reddit gives the IRS far too much credit. It has had an employee deficit for years now, short tens of thousands of qualified individuals at this very moment, all while lowering standards in an attempt to stoo the bleeding. The IRS still can't even get basic PII security right and is directly responsible for millions of fraudulently filed taxed returns due to their own inept, clown world infosec practices that were never considered secure by any professional cybersecurity organization at any point.
Let's not even start the lingering effects of the backlog created by the government shutdown and the increasing political pressure to chase down the 40+ million off-the-books non-taxpayers of foreign descent to pay their fair shares.
Ya'll give these buffoons far too much credit. They talk a big game from time to time, planting news stories about their new initiatives to hire experts in this or that field to combat the increasingly large number of citizens that have decided to make up for their lack of wage gains in a historic bull market lead by record corporate profits by dropping out of the system of obfuscating income via self-employment. Which is often forced upon individuals due to the government's ambivalence toward properly regulating the growing corporate abuse of contract labor (both domestic and via foreign H1x) and the blind eye turned to the scourge of parasitic, useless middleman "recruiter" contract companies.
Basically, the last 5 or 6 administrations have only added fuel to the fire by catering to every corporate interest while leaving the working class citizen to fight an army of Goliaths. This is why Donny boy is now the president, despite proving to be a giant stooge puppet that has only continued down the same retarded economic path, with a few personalized tweaks meant to further enrich his particular financier puppetlords (protip: every admin has their own).
USAgov has put itself in this corner thanks to decades of mismanagement and flagrant corruption. It may have an endless budget, but it can no longer reliably recruit the best and brightest it needs for many agencies. If it hasn't already, it won't be long before your daily lives are intruded upon by underpaid, bribe-friendly foreign national mercenary beauracrats subcontracted by some multinational recruiting firm that gets a few billion in minority and female owned "Made in America" small business subsidies trying to shake you down for a few missing forms and a fucking pen you bought with 3.99 worth of bitcoin on amazon. 
But by then, it will be too late.
Bet on it.

Holla at yo boyz at the FedRes to print up next year's budget and go beg Bezos and Buffett to donate back all those phat and juicy tax credits, subsidies and government agency contract profits we paid above market rate for.

Shorting btc is the worst idea, even in a bear market. Far too volatile and unpredictable. When it moves, it almost always moves far more than the market thinks is reasonable. 
Even when I believe it will go down, I just sell or wait and buy more. It's always blown my mind how many traders think they can short and survive. 
I think the availability of leverage and more widespread ability to short on crypto exchanges will be the catalyst to a parabolic surge beyond $20k in less time than any of us imagined.

This guy knows. Stock market is just as manipulated and irrational as crypto, just far more liquid and thus, less volatile. 
If I want to have a whole million or two at 67, which will be worth today's 300-500k, then sure I can throw my money away on mutual funds and bonds. But despite being a faithful, and above average contributor to the ol' 401k/IRA setup since 2006...the returns aren't going to provide any sort of comfort in old age unless I'm willing to either live like a pauper in the present while contributing the max allowance, or I find a job or career that pays me like an entitled boomer. 
In less than half the time I've been investing in the rigged stock market, I've made 14x the money in cryptoland. This past January, I took out a five-figure loan and went all in on BTC ETH LTC. Paid off half of it today. Glad I didn't take advice from Reddit.
Sure, I could wait a few years to pay off the loan in the hopes of hitting 100k, but I'm not THAT stupid. I'll take my 150-200% profits, burn some risk, sleep well and be happy (not greedy).
I'm patient. I'm almost a millionaire despite my $40k a year job. Once bitcoin heads to the six figures, even if that is three or four years from now, I will start my own business, happily discriminate against boomers, and pay my people above market rates--in crypto. Oh, it's HAPPENING!
