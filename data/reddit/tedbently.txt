Thanks, makes sense. Your ‘lightning wallet’ becomes your new hot wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:36:03
Ah, it makes more sense if there is more than one business using the LN network. So I can make several payments via a single LN channel instead of make separate transactions on the main network. Similar to bitcoin there is a network effect.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:05:09
Genuine question, I'm trying to understand how this would reduce network congestion. Lets say I plan to use TorGuard for 1 year which costs about 4mBTC. With the LN network I could split up the payments on a monthly or even daily basis. For example,
1. TorGuard and I lock 4mBTC in a LN channel
2. Every day I transfer (1 / 365) * 4mBTC to TorGuard
3. At any time I can cancel the service and get back the remainder of my deposit
This is great if I don't trust TorGuard and don't want to pay the full amount in advance. But I still need to open and close the LN channel, which would cost me more in BTC fees than making a single bulk payment? Am I missing something?

If you are doing a long term investment I would highly recommend Armory: 
If you don't mind spending $100, a hardware wallet like Trezor would be easier to setup: 
*Edit*: I should probably mention it takes some effort to get Armory running but in my opinion it's the safest setup. It will probably take a couple of hours to go over the tutorials and get familiar with everything. You need an old computer for your offline wallet and around ~100Gb of free space on your online computer.

I agree, but it is hard to in practice. To trade you need quick access to your funds and it takes too long to transfer in and out. However, I try to minimize risk by never having more than 10% of my saving in one exchange. And I do my homework - after a little bit of research back in August I decided to stay clear of gox.

I buy all my coins from coinbase - you pay a premium but this is the easiest way for US users. I mainly trade on **bitstamp**, but I'm thinking of switching to **kraken** (they have a very solid trade engine and handled the malleability issue without a problem).  **btc-e** works well but I wouldn't leave my money there for a longer time - the operators are anonymous but for now I think they are more interested in keeping the exchange running rather than taking off with all the money. Occasionally I trade alternative coins on cryptsy (so far never more than 3% of my holdings).

*Armory coldstorage question*: I've my Armory wallet on an offline computer. To transfer funds I usually put my signed transactions on a USB and then broadcast them from my online computer. The online computer was  running a full bitcoin node and had a full copy of the blockchain.
Yesterday, the harddrive of the online computer failed :( Maybe it was not so smart running a bitcoin node on a SSD? How can I transfer my funds now? Is my only option to buy a new drive and re-download the blockchain? This will take me over a week, so is there another way to access my coldstorage BTCs during this time?

I guess there are different scenarios you could consider:
* *You want to buy something with bitcoin but don't have any*: 1) Purchase bitcoin from coinbase (1% fee), 2) Send money to merchant (no fee)
* *You are a merchant accepting bitcoin*: keep it (no fee) or convert it to your local currency using coinbase (1% fee)
* You change your mind after buying bitcoin (1% + 1% fee)
Ideally, merchants would keep their bitcoins and use it it to pay their suppliers. There would be no need for currency conversions and (almost) no money will be wasted on fees.
@_date: 2016-01-01 07:58:24
Thank you! I realized you were going after UTC and not CST - yeah, I keep forgetting USA is not the center of the world :p
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:49:25
I don't know, my point was simply that they have an income stream. They have 3 million users but they do not publish how many transactions they process. They also provide merchant tools where they charge 1%, but again there is no data.
However, the exchange volume is public so you can calculate how much they make. For example, last month 239k BTC was traded. That's about 239,000 BTC * $400/BTC * 0.25% = $239,000 in fees. This is actually less than I expected :p

It would be useful to make a clearer distinction between "altcoins". I agree, a discussion about Litecoin would be off-topic since it is a separate, independent coin that exists alongside with Bitcoin. Bitcoin Classic on the other hand is supposed to be an update or patch that solves an existing problem. The goal is to replace the current version and end up with only one blockchain.
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:35:52
You are thinking of bitcoin to bitcoin transactions. Coinbase is an exchange company where you can transfer between Bitcoin and local currencies (USD, Euro, etc.). For this service they take a small fee. Of course, you can find someone that is willing to sell Bitcoin and directly buy from them.
@_date: 2016-03-10 17:48:11
In addition coinbase has to monitor your transactions for illegal activity. So if you transfer your coins directly from coinbase to a gambling site they will shut down your account. But if you use a personal wallet in-between you are fine (for now).

Would changing the block generation time from 10 to 5 minutes achieve the same effect? Essentially you double the amount of possible transactions but you also have faster confirmations. This would reduce the risk of double spending attacks. Litecoin already confirms blocks every 2.5 minutes and it seems to work fine. 
Why is the main focus on bigger blocks instead of more frequent blocks? Are there some major drawbacks I'm not aware of?
@_date: 2016-06-29 08:00:12
Your account probably got flagged because of AML/KYC requirements. They are a US based business and have to follow the law. Try contacting support and they can tell what's going on / what info they need. In future, just use coinbase to transition in and out of fiat. Don't use it as a wallet! Be your own bank, this is Bitcoin after all ;)

Good point ... I looked up the transaction on tradeblock.com and it was received "14 Jun 2016 23:53:20 (39 minutes ago)". However, there is a conflicting transaction with 74e1ee749aa6a1cdc29c2b1324d82a7899dd4d02b4bce991373940925833b779 which has 6 confirmations. Not sure what happened there ...
@_date: 2016-06-15 05:06:07
For the transaction fee you paid about 44 satoshies/byte. The network is currently congested because of the 1 MB blocksize limit. Right now you need to pay 90 satoshies/byte to get into the next block ( So either you have to re-send the transaction with a higher fee or simply wait a couple of days for the network to clear up :/
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:25:02
Ok, I guess I'm just confused about the politics. I don't think Bitpay has any malicious intent and they even updated their post. I personally think this blow out of proportion and a lot of FUD is spread to influence the price. For example, by calling 2x into question BCH has gone up over 50%. I suspect this is a pump-n-dump; in a few days 2x will be back on track and BCH will crash. A few whales will be richer and the divide in the Bitcoin community will be even deeper :/

Well, lets do the math. Assume you invest $100 and the price

I’ve tried using NNs for price prediction but it’s very hard to avoid overfitting. Also, since the market cap is relatively small it can easily be influenced by news events and social media. Maybe you could scalp bitcoin news stories and social media posts in addition to market data.

Yes, only increasing the blocksize is not enough. We need to work on a comprehensive solution, for example something that includes parallel validation of blocks, headers-first mining, thin blocks, etc.
