There are some that are going to try to do that. I've been browsing various ICO's for such exchanges. I'm not worried about the UI, but more about marketing.

Well Bitcoin Cash is a shit coin that tries to mooch off the Bitcoin name.

No, the free market is not a pyramidal scheme.

I'm the opposite. Never had issues with Bitcoin yet but have had issues with both my Visa and Mastercard. Both of which went down a couple times this year alone already.

Shhhh.. don't ruin the bull run.

No, the only correct writing is **should  have**. "Should of" is grammatically incorrect.

It never even touched 20K on most exchanges and there was absolutely no support for 20K by any means.
