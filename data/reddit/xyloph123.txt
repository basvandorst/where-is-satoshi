While I haven't looked into the details of Bisq, I'm curious isn't a decentralized exchange slower on a per-transaction basis than a centralized one?
For eg., once a buyer and seller agree on exchanging X USD for Y BTC, buyer needs to do a bank transfer for X (slow step, fees) and seller needs to transfer Y BTC (fees to get it done quickly). Whereas on something like Coinbase where (I'm assuming) all BTC addresses are owned by Coinbase itself, buyer only needs to transfer an amount to Coinbase in bulk, and can potentially make multiple purchases with almost no fees (since all BTC stays on Coinbase addresses, and all money stays within Coinbase). So lower fees and shorter turn around times per-transaction. Please let me know if I'm missing something!

I was hoping to get feedback on a crypto/bitcoin use case in the credit card referral space. Credit card referrals can offer significant value to the tune of $100 to upwards of $5000 a year. However, most people rarely accrue the full value of their own referral links. Two of the factors that prevent people from actively using referral links:
1. A community to find referral links from?
2. Incentive for using a referral link over a public link?
1) is somewhat solved from the many travel communities and blogs available online. A compelling reason for 2 ) is if two parties can mutually agree to use each other's referral links. This does happen online today, however, it is adhoc and the parties can't **trust** each other to follow through on this.
If there was a way for the two parties to stake their personal money as a guarantee that they will indeed follow through on the referral usage, both parties stand to gain. More formally, say A and B match such that
\- A agrees to use B's referral link and vice-versa
\- both move x tokens to a common address
\- both follow through on their promise
\- both are satisfied with the other's action (A and B get their referral bonuses)
\- both get x back to their accounts
\[There are some edge cases here that I glossed over\]
Is this something that makes sense / the right use case for crypto / already being worked on? Where (not partial to any crypto / platform) would you suggest I look next if I wanted to prototype something like this?
