While I appreciate the ferver, I personally will continue to attempt to maximize my realized potentials... If we are stuck in a bear market for the next 5 years and we chill in the high thousands range, that's great I'll DCA throughout but on the spikes I'll still DCA sell.

That makes sense with your prerogative. I'd agree with you short term but we have very little data about the long term security of storing value in Crypto. We have more data on using Gold/Silver as a safe storage of wealth  compared to the 9 years of $BTC existence

I keep a good portion of my bitcoin for the long term HODL life, but I have set stops depending on how I feel the market is fluctuating. For instance, I just sold 5% of my bag at a 12% spike at the end of the last month. Made a good couple bucks, and then at the 9900 dip I had money on my account to buy some cheap bitcoin
If you just hodl forever, your bitcoin is only worth what the market is worth, and because I anticipate major spikes up and down between now and the day I die; it only makes sense to profit off of the spikes.

Realistically they don't need 1.9 billion$, they only need that number should Tether start dumping. Even if they have 0$, it's still only a $2billion dollar swing... We've had a $13billion trade volume in the last 24 hours and have almost  a $200b market cap. So if Tether fails all at once we will obviously see a dip but how much? Maybe another 20-30%? That's nothing for us. There would be more long term advantages then disadvantages to surviving an 'attack' like this. Proves our strength as a market is impenetrable to bad actors

Google how to set up a BitCoin wallet (also info in the Side Bar). You'll scan the QR code and it'll give you a code that will allow you to transfer it. COINBASE is NOT a WALLET it is an EXCHANGE. 
Remember the golden rule of bitcoin:
If you don't have access to your private keys, you don't have access to your bitcoin. 
Move your BTC off of Exchanges and keep it in Cold storage.

Step 1:
Research and learn everything you can about the technology and learn the relationships between the market and news, the market and alt coins, etc. etc. et.c
Step 2:
Open a coinbase account; then go to GDAX.com (owned and operated by Coinbase)
Step 3: 
Put a purchase order in on GDAX and pay ~ 0 fees (0.25% max if you don't set a limit buy I think)
Step 4:
Move your coins off of the exchange onto a paper wallet or a hardware wallet (preferred if it's more than a couple bucks)
Step 5:
HODL for life.
Other advice: 
Do. Not. Daytrade. Bitcoin. Unless. Your. Professional. Job. Is. Daytrading.
99.9% of people can't time the market and lose money because of it. Dollar cost average your buys, set up recurring purchases, and cash out as you feel necessary; but never panic sell.

Ripple has a lot of potential and there is a relative correlation between bitcoin price and (not complete shitcoin) alt coin prices. I think Ripple has profits and potential in the coming days/months/years/decades? but Ripple is not built to overtake Bitcoin by any means. I don't invest in Bitcoin because it's decentralized soley; sure that's a major selling point but there's a lot of other extremely exciting things Bitcoin can do for this world. Don't NOT invest in XRP just because it's centralized. XRP returns are likely going to be &gt; the average stock return.

Coinbase is 100% fine. Segwit is a technology that makes transactions faster and cheaper; if you're just going to hold onto your bitcoin and/or buy more Coinbase is 100% fine. If you start transacting in it (purchasing goods with bitcoin, or selling goods for bitcoin) You'll need a wallet -- which I'd suggest should be a Segwit address. 
REmember the golden rule of bitcoin:
If you don't own your private keys, you don't own the bitcoin. Always move significant (non-day trading amounts) of bitcoin off of exchanges into cold storage. Helps with FUD and panic selling too.

Might be a good opportunity to redistribute your wealth.
A common practice is to out your wealth in percentages:
For me right now I like the idea of 66% BTC, 33% fiat. My bitcoin has grown so much its closer to 90% right now so I will probably re distribute in a little bit here. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:48:39
No, because it's a deflationary system.
Let's use easy numbers: There's only 100 bitcoin total.
There are 1000 users today and the miners are taking the transaction fees of those 1000 users moving around the 100 bitcoin. 
User 33 tells his aunt and uncle about Bitcoin; now there are 1002 users. This creates a greater demand for a limited supply of items; so the price of bitcoin goes up. 
Sure the miners still take the transaction fees, but if you bought bitcoin when only 10 people were trading it and suddenly there are 10,000 people trading it; you will have seen a profit.

There are coins who use the hashpower of the network to solve issues. Bitcoin's hashpower is used to power the Bitcoin network; not "real problems"

Statistically speaking there have always been and likely always will be market corrections after inflated price points due to speculation and hype.
People want to make money with BitCoin so they will sell when they don't think the price will get higher than a certain price point.
After almost every ATH there has been a subsequent dip, followed by a surge. When that occurs next (even if it's 9300-9500 that surges to 10,760 I want in at those dips).
Always buy more BitCoin. Never buy "high" when possible. Buying the dips helps the market correct course and send it back on track to the moon whence it came.

Bitcoin certainly could and has been "washed" before. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:53:59
The basis is:
Buy low, sell high.
Don't try to time the market unless you're a professional day trader. Especially during this run of growth there have been very few dips that you could increase holdings on.
If you do it, make a rule: sell at a 5% increase, and then buy at a 5% decrease (10% profits assuming the prices rise again)
So easy math without exact percentages:
Price: $10,000 (you own 0.5)
Price: $10,500 (sell your bitcoin and have $5250 usd)
Price: $9,500 (buy btc and have 0.55263157894736 btc) 
Yay free BTC. I would advise to just buy more bitcoin every 5% dip instead of trying to sell high and buy low because most people LOSE A LOT OF FUCKING MONEY. 
Good luck, may the hodl gods be in your favor.

Bitcoin obviously, I think litecoin has a lot of potential applications and could grow a lot. I think etherum will probably fade out.
The problem is the crypto space is so damn volatile with new icos every week so we don't really know.
Diversity is good but I don't think that there will end up being more than 2/3 reliable crypto networks because they all see each other as competitors and one will try to eclipse the other.
Personally I'm buying a few litecoin and a few eth and hoping for the best but I'm on the Bitcoin ride or die train

As I'm sure you know by now- Coinbase is extremely slow. I would suggest doing a little research and start using GDAX, it's owned by Coinbase and is very secure as well (nothing is ever certain though, so keep yourself safe!) by doing this you can avoid the fees associated with Coinbase.

How about some helpful insight:
The price hit a shit ton of ATH's today. Go back at the price history and look what happens when we hit ATH's.
The price typically drops and then corrects above the ATH to a new ATH.
When's the time to buy bitcoin? Yesterday. When's the next best time to buy bitcoin? Now.
If we assume the price will hit $20,000 in the next 40 years (I'll do some horrid thing to myself or an animal if it doesn't) then the difference between 9000/8900/9100 isn't huge.
The best I can say is go with your gut. Never invest anything you aren't willing to lose and don't panic sell unless you honestly lose faith in the technology behind it.

You're biggest mistake was going in all at once. You gotta slowly dose them with info, gaining confidence and interest. Explain the block chain, and how seeds work. Show them the metal press you used to store your seed. Then, send them to coinbase and. Let them get their feet wet, a week later ask them if they've heard about gdax. Make sure they know how to pull btc off of coinbase to a wallet. A month later teach them about gemini and get them a Nano S with their profits.

Let me ask you a question you should be asking yourself.
Where do you think bitcoin will be in 1 week? 1 month? 1 year?
If you think the price is going to maintain even half of the growth we've seen this year, prices will be in the $50-60k range. What's the difference between 9000/9100/8900 as an initial investment? Not much.
But if you wait until $22k to hit a solid dip you've already lost a lot of money.
As always only invest what you're willing to lose and don't take reddit advice as gospel, do your own research and ask questions along the way. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:45:20

Theft. You're stealing their electricity, which is illegal.
There are no loop holes here donut do it... Also mining is very low profitability as of late so even with a top of the line rig it's not worth it.
Also make decisions based on two things in life:
Can you live with the worst case scenario (jail time, fines) and is your decision a risk, or reckless? This one's reckless.

Nobody knows what will happen.. It'll always be a gamble but at some point if you want in you need to get in. Price will certainly go above $20k if adoption hits the goals we expect it to. You should do more research and solidify your opinion on your own.

So my strategy involves a lot of stupid moves because it gives me an adrenaline rush.
I bought in 600$ at 5737 and I use all of my profits to try and buy dips and then sell on peaks.
So far I've made a little but realistically the best way to do it (safely) is to buy in on a dip when you see a decent buy wall forming (indicating that the price might stabilize) and then hodl.
Two weeks later on the next natural dip, buy in low and hodl.
Just keep investing and hodl'ing.

13.2 million users in coinbase
Let's assume coinbase will hold only 20% of all BTC users ever to be pessimistic (likely higher)
If there are 330 mln US citizens and 10% of them adopt btc and hold $1000 usd, that's 33 million people holding 1000$ which is 33bln market value.
If coinbase holds 20% of us citizens that own btc that's 20% of 33million= 6.6million people.
There are over 7 billion people on earth, so if only Americans use btc (obviously not true) and we do get 6.6mln Americans to use coinbase  then 6.6mln / 7bln = 0.008% adoption.
If it becomes widely adopted and you buy in now youre gonna be happy. With only 13 mln users on coinbase right now, you're way ahead of the mass adoption curve.

The problem is those other exchanges are not USD based fiat, so unless you have easy access to other fiats to purchase and you have enough capital that the gains (sometimes as high as 13% difference) would have to outway the TX fees from Fiat -&gt; fiat -&gt; crypto -&gt; exchange -&gt; wallet, etc.

Not 100% but a good portion. The saying that "bitcoin is digital gold" is phrased that way for a reason.
When the gold rush happened in the US in California, people didn't drop everything and abandon their homes to go pan for gold to use to buy they groceries, they did it because the value of gold and availability of it was high.
Right now it's easy to gain access to bitcoin, and it's value is high. I buy bitcoin because I have faith in the technology and the community. While this sub is a bad representation of the devs and miners, there are a solid core of supporters that will see it through its life cycle regardless of price.

There have been a few "splits" in Bitcoin's history - we call these hardforks. 
Recently, there was the 8/1/2017 hardfork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) - which people I believe should have received 1:1 depending on if their wallet supported it. (Coinbase doesn't)
Then there was the 10/23/2017 Bitcoin Gold hardfork - I'm pretty sure that crashed and burned, I haven't read much about it. 
What you were most likely referring to was the planned SegWit2x hardfork which would have created (B2x) that would have happened today or tomorrow; but they called it off because the big backers decided they didn't want to risk dividing the community over what they still see as a necessary change. You can check the public release that cancelled it here (

My target changes from day to day. Always looking to buy more haha.
Honestly I just look at the Buy book and diversify my buys 10$ more than any significant buy wall.
If I had to guess based on where the market has been and where we've seen support, 7700 is the lowest we'll go on basic corrections and dips. Something catastrophic or scary could make it go lower but those are unlikely after everything we've been through this month...
Again, complete and utter speculation with that number. I personally think it'll grow very casually here through the weekend and then Monday or Tuesday people will make some moves.

Just hold and buy if it dips. If you believe it will go up but don't know when / if it will go down, then you're best bet is to buy more when and if it dips and when it goes up you're making a bigger percentage gain on your initial investment and making gains on your secondary investment.

@_date: 2017-11-15 06:02:08
I'd start with going on Google and typing in Bitcoin news and searching under the news tab.
Read a couple dozen articles and when you don't understand something they talk about watch a YouTube video of someone explaining it.
As you understand more, read more technical articles (look at bitcoin trading forums, here, YouTube) and continue to learn more while you research.
All the while buy dips and hodl.

These are just my opinions, and what I'm getting at is that nothing would cause btc to drop to $2k at this point but something so catastrophic that it would completely die. The things that could cause this are more and more unlikely every day btc stays gains value and adopters.

Seem like really wide margins especially if prices start to stabilize after we get through this series of hellish weeks. Any reason you chose 20% over say 12%?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:43:37
No lol. If you could see trends in bitcoin you're a genie and I want to be your friend.
Don't sell, just hold. Buy more at the dip and you'll make profit on both investments in a month with no chance of losing money trying to time the market.
I don't think it'd going to dip at all tomorrow. I think it will tonight around 9pm est and then soar up with Asian support

@_date: 2017-11-25 14:35:32
Let's get realistic and then hop back on the hype train after:
YES. Yes, bitcoin is a gamble. Purchasing any crypto currency is a gamble. Using any exchange is a gamble. Not holding your own private keys is a gamble. With this gamble, there are potential for extremely high pay offs and for extremely high losses; however, the likely hood that BTC drops to near nothing is almost impossible. It could easily slid back a couple months of growth but not everyone's going to jump ship.
I believe bitcoin will be the future of currency. I really hope it happens within my lifetime (currently 20 y/o) but if it doesn't then it will during my children, their children's etc.
At some point fiat money will fail us and we will need to move to an international currency that will always work. When we move to space travel in a hundred years? Fiat money certainly won't be usable.
So if you set you sell price to $13,000 and cash out you're going to make money. If you set a dip sell at $7,000 you'll lose money.
Perpetual growth is unlikely in short term, but over the course of decades we will likely see drastic growth as adoption and activity increases.
Take the gamble. Your grandchildren will thank you.

Ask your mum? My mom always loaned me money when we played monopoly.
I highly doubt they'd loan it for specifically using bitcoin but you could probably lie. The problem is you still have to pay interest on that loan money and it's possible the growth of your btc won't be higher than your interest.
You've got $5,000 of shit laying around, go sell it on eBay dawg

@_date: 2017-11-15 05:52:33
I think if I had 2BTC and I saw massive gains (even buying around the 2130$ range) I would appreciate and understand the growth potential in bitcoin so I might take out like 0.5 BTC and leave it as cash and just try to time some dip buys... Then hopefully my holdings would slowly increase and I could keep gambling with 0.5 BTC because that's half the fun

If you're comfortable waiting 5 years you've just bought yourself a good down payment on a car or house.
The chances of a dip at some point between now and 5 years from now is nearly 100%. How much of a dip? No ones knows. Will the network ultimately fail? Very unlikely.
I think you made a damn good investment, but yes it's always gambling. Never gamble what you can't afford to lose.
The "don't point a gun at someone unless you intend to shoot" analogy fits with the "don't gamble what you can't lose" analogy well. Only invest expecting a possibility of losing everything.
Good luck and congratulations on a good decision!

But like I made a joke and you got triggered, I the liberal SJW in your explanation of this interaction... Didn't? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:03:47
Or conversely; the buying the dips and hodl'ing is the BACKBONE of the Bitcoin price. The community that supports and knows its labors will come to fruition are the ones that allow big institutions to come in and utilize the crypto for the things you were talking about.
Without the hodl'rs and those who buy the dips to bring the price back up; the market would be drastically more volatile, would it not?
Thus, the hodl'rs are just holding out long enough for bitcoin to take off in a major way, and without them it would never happen. 
So perhaps a blind faith -- another human quality -- is what is keeping Bitcoin alive.
HODL and buy dips my friends!

Nothing. Search the sub for a post from like 2 days ago that had some good explanations.
The nodes aren't centralized so Noone can shut down a single bottleneck that would throttle the network, so we are still safe. It would be more. Costly to shut down the network enough to decrease prices than the natural growth of the network. Never forget btc is global, not American. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:48:48

A crypto is only worth something if it is capable of growing capital or revolutionizing transactions imho.
Sure there are people that are hodl'ing doge coin so they can say they own doge coin but its never gonna go anywhere.

People have talked about using mBTC (milli bitcoin) and some wallets already support it. I think it's important we have these discussions but I've always been shut down when bringing it up.

Don't listen to you won't safely make the money back by mining alt coins and you certainly won't make it by mining btc. With the Gtx 1080 I have I could maybe make like $5 max day without counting for fees or electric bill. Mining is obsolete unless you have atleast 10k$ USD to burn and even then the chances of making a profit aren't 100%.
Instead buy 0.04 btc or w/e the equivalent is and you'll make more money.
If you want to: buying a better GFX card isn't a horrible idea if you play games etc. But do not buy a card solely with the purpose if mining bitcoin as the profits for solo miners has gone to shit

I will always sell some at peaks for profit but it's unlikely I ever become a nocoiner.
Unless something happens that causes bitcoin to no longer be bitcoin the price is determined by waves of great promise and excitement and then panic and fear.
The FUD in the last few days with a generally stable 10-12k price over the last few weeks caused people to panic, cut their losses and cry.
