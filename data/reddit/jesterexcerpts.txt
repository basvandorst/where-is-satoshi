They will come around, in due time,  as they realize how worthless fiat has become....pretty normal conversation at this point as most people just do not understand

Check Bittrex

That’s the beauty of it.   No need to value it in fiat

Do people buy BTC to have access to forks?  I suppose if it is a worthwhile modification that has some promise this makes sense.  But it seems that there are many forks that don’t amount to anything...???  I don’t know but I am long BTC and personally haven’t bought BTC for the forks.

Thanks.  The Bakkt launch is also nice to consider as well.

What’s the reference to Nov 5?

Bittrex- I haven’t deposited USD here but you can.  Several USD trade pairs.

Real. But not sure why anyone would lay those fees...

valid points/concerns.  The ecosystem isn't mature enough at this point in my opinion, but is rapidly developing.  I think you are right that with a major recession, people are more apt to take their btc/crypto holdings into fiat.
I think holding BTC long term is great, thinking 5-10 yrs.  But I suspect there is a potential to a flash crash of BTC market prices to 1K or even sub 1K.  I have set some buy orders anticipating some increased volatility in the coming months - maybe they don't hit, but maybe they do....
