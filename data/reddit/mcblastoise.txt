That's a **huge** difference in profitability and in the 5 hours since you commented that, you still haven't edited your post with that necessary information. This is the definition of a scam.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:35:34
Exactly, and this post isn't even as informative as that. Just says the price is low, with some useless snark. Reported for Spam.

Lmao, all of these people are sockpuppets? You're out of your mind.

With the gains from the night before
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:05:56




Those reasons are not why it is no longer profitable.

Lmao I love the transition of the edits as it dawns on you
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:17:29


This is patently untrue
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:16:56
The main issue is electricity costs. The ASIC miners today which are required to mine (reason for that I suppose is indirectly competition) consume huge amounts of electricity. This means that you will generally be paying more for the electricity than you will be earning, i.e. you'll always be in the red.
There are lots of other reasons though. One obvious one is that the initial investment (buying the miners) is pretty high. Each miner costs thousands of dollars, so just to get a *very* basic setup of 10 miners, you'll be out tens of thousands from the get-go. This would be fine if they paid for themselves, but as stated before, they probably won't.
There are more miscellaneous issues: they release a lot of heat, make a ton of sound, need to be positioned in such a way that they're not a fire hazard (which is a legitimate concern when you're operating a farm of hundreds), etc.
All in all, it takes a ton of planning and a lot of cash flow to start with. On top of that, you need *exceptionally* cheap electricity and an environment where the sound, heat, etc, aren't an issue. But I hear Alaska is pretty good for the conditions I just laid out.

Your post is useless okay. That's why you're getting downvoted.
People don't need you to remind them that the price is low. That's what alerts and BTC charts are for. If they don't have those, then they don't need to hear it from you either.
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:20:18
No problem, I used to be just as curious and interested as you were before I learned all this. Now I'm just gonna stick to HODLing, lol.
@_date: 2019-07-08 17:02:53
Your initial comment was so confusing that there is no way we were going to interpret this from it.
@_date: 2019-07-13 21:07:16
Buy more while the price is down
@_date: 2019-07-13 23:23:01
Ahh, but you don't realize that the night before, the price rose 50%. So in reality, the drop just slightly lessened your gains.
@_date: 2019-07-08 17:34:17
Okay let me run through all of the questions that come to one's mind while reading your comment, so you can figure out why you got downvoted so hard.


How do you buy something on accident? And after you clarified, you didn't buy it on accident, you just used a different payment method.


Didn't bother to explain why you don't have it now which would be helpful in order to understand what it means "to get it back". Also, you've used so many pronouns it's impossible to know if you're talking about BTC or fiat.


Do you mean that literally or that you just want it to? Either way, didn't specify why your price point is 12k specifically at all.


Wait, I thought you didn't have it? So how did you use it to buy something? And if you did use it, then why do you still have it?
This is what people mean when they say it's confusing. It raises more questions than it answers.
@_date: 2019-08-05 06:44:01
Tbh I think some people here are just a little too focused on privacy. Like, I doubt OP cares if we know his address.
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:12:37
No I got that, lol. I meant like what platform. Bank transfer? CashApp? PayPal? Zelle? Cash in-person?
@_date: 2019-06-17 22:08:57
I really don't think you know what FOMO actually is.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:22:31


Did you HODL?
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:20:10
Keep it and just wait till the price gets back to where it was when you purchased it. Shouldn't be too far from now.
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:36:30


Yep, exactly. I don't know why exactly, but it seems like on all of these P2P exchanges, Bitcoin is king. It's always worth more than the payment methods used to purchase it.
If someone else could chime in with the reason why, I'd appreciate it! :)
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:01:08
And on what are you basing that statement?
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:36:24
There is one. It's called an "Unauthorized dispute". Basically they just say that they weren't the one who sent the payment, i.e, they weren't in control of their account.
I've been on the receiving end before. They kept the Bitcoin, the money, *and* PayPal charged me a $20 chargeback fee. Absolutely terrible experience.
If you're going to accept PayPal, be prepared for the possibility of a chargeback.
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:05:55
If you've never bought and you're worried you might mess it up, I would advise doing a test run with like $5-10, and then once you're sure you know what you're doing, go for a big buy like $500.
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:52:29
Robinhood doesn't actually sell you BTC, but rather BTC "derivatives". So you can't transfer it. Basically just for people who want to day-trade.
@_date: 2019-06-13 21:38:11
Because that's what his ass told him.
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:10:25
What form of payment are you trying to receive in exchange for it?

@_date: 2019-06-26 06:48:29
That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:05:17


@_date: 2019-06-24 07:02:37
It's not really misleading at all, you've just claimed that without actually explaining how. It seemed quite clear to me and most other people who read it.
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:43:52
The best time to invest was like 6 months ago. The second best time is now.
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:07:29
Nobody can say for sure. I'm just saying that you should be completely sure before you buy in.
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:32:27

Well I applaud your wrongness for pushing us through 12k and beyond. Cheers, good sir. You're doing God's work.
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:09:32
If you were buying BTC, you would get lower than the spot price typically. But conversely, if you're selling on Bisq, you would get higher than the spot price.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:42:59


Oof thought we were talking to a millionaire here. 


Same. Bought in at 3.5k and 4k with some pocket money, just to get some skin in the game.

Hey thanks, didn't actually think you'd deliver! You should post that on the subreddit. I feel like people would be more interested in the maximums than the minimums.

I'm glad I was here to witness this.

Man, quit complaining that you're unable to read for a few minutes like the rest of us. It reflects more on you than it does anyone else.
Was that brief enough for you?
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:33:44
That's exactly why I said that. I truly hoped that this was some elaborate irony. I think the guy's delusional.
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:18:53




If it looks exactly like the real one, then posting its URL would make people pay more attention when entering the *real* one. Furthermore, the more it's spread around that that link is fraudulent, the higher the chance it will be exposed to too many people to continue to deceive people. Their whole model works on you *not expecting it*.


Please explain how giving us the **link to a website** could, *in any way*, put your privacy at risk. That's just ludicrous.
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:27:39


Can you explain what you mean by this? Are you specifically referring to Coinbase/exchanges?
@_date: 2019-05-31 23:05:05
Lol, what answer were you expecting? You didn't even ask a question.
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:47:12
This comment is underrated as hell.
@_date: 2019-05-31 23:25:30
I highly doubt that. But you do you, man.
@_date: 2019-05-28 11:17:56


Tbh I'm not even really sure what you mean by this. I believe you're referring to the price of 1 BTC. But that's completely arbitrary. 1 BTC has no special significance other than it being 1 BTC. You could refer to them in terms of Satoshis and they'd suddenly be much cheaper.


That depends on what transaction fee you choose when you send it. Now if you're saying that the fee is expensive, then I can get on board with that. But it's not inherently slow.
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:29:47
If you "honestly hate hanging around this subreddit", then why don't you just leave? Lol, nothing's stopping you.
