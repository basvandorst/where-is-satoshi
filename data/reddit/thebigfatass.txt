You didn't try to help.  I've read your comments and see your angle.  You're a very intelligent person that has it in for bitcoin and would like to stop it's progression.
How is your favorite subreddit buttcoin doing?  You are VERY good at what you do.  I'm just wondering why you do it.
Do you code for banks or something?

I think you're wrong and that thought is harmful to grow the community.

Pennies don't generally go up in value.

Penis or millipenis?

You're just wrong.  I save all my tips.  I know how much bitcoin is worth.   People know what bitcoin is now and NO ONE treats it as worthless because it simply isn't.  Only fools would throw away any amount.

I see your point but bitcoin is also a speculative asset.  People use to give 10,000 btc tips and it was seen as absurd.

Bitcoin is apolitical.  Imagine he just happened to be talking about how he liked grapes and you loved grapes too.

You can tell a lot about a person from their comment history.

I disagree and I think you guys are thinking in the past on this.  I know I'm going to catch flak for criticizing you guys but comparing a penny to any amount of btc is simply absurd.   This was the same EXACT thing people use to say about whole bitcoin.  THE SAME EXACT THING.  Think about that.

Dude...you post negative stuff about bitcoin all the time.  Anyone can read your comments in Just commenting there you're supporting the anti-bitcoin movement.   
Anyhow, you got points and discouraged folks from tipping so that was the net result.
@_date: 2014-05-14 01:28:30
Every tip I've gotten, I LOVE.  I can't understand people not wanting a limited asset.  It's almost laughable.
@_date: 2014-05-14 01:55:16
Folks upvoting this that support bitcoin may want to look at this guys post history.  He's clearly a master FUD artist.

I don't go for points.  Your comments will score well but they are simply wrong and harmful.  
People love to bandwagon so good on you.  You should say something else negative like my comb over is silly and get some more points.

It's simply not the same.
