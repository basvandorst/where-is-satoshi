These ATM's always have the most ridiculous fees. Don't know why you would go to one and pay 13 percent fees when you can use an exchange that has something like 1 percent for fees, all from your phone.

Cryptocurrencies are never going to replace fiat currency. That's the cold, simple truth.
You're not going to find a government or country that is going to have cryptocurrency as it's currency. It just wont work. Other governments most likely won't accept it making international trading and loans an issue. 
Corporations won't pay their staff in it and investors won't use it for investing. (Investing IN bitcoins is a totally different thing).
I'm not trying to be rude but it's a matter of facts. Cryptocurrency is good in theory, but its just not stable enough and not ready for day to day use. It does have its benefits though, and I am not going to deny that.

Yeah, I have heard people say they don't want to buy BTC because it is too expensive, but they will buy XRP because they can get so many more coins with the same $$.
When I tell them you can buy $50 worth of BTC if you want and that you don't need to own an entire BTC, they just dismiss the idea and say they want to own full amounts and because XRP cost less per token that it has more potential to go up.
Well not really, a 10 percent gain in either coins will net you the same return.

You covered it? No you didn't. You said that you covered it in your original post, which is bullshit because it's not in there. You didn't back it up when I asked then so maybe you will now. I'll ask it again seeing as you haven't addressed it. If you can't do it, don't reply.
Show me their policy where it specifically states you will get a 100 percent refund on any stored crypto in the event of a hack/website shutdown/some other event
If you can't do it, then it is established that any Crypto you store with them isn't insured.
How simple is that?
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:27:40


Okay so we have established that any coins you keep on an exchange are NOT insured and you won't be reimbursed by the exchange in the event your coins are lost/taken/seized/hacked/insert whatever else here. 
It says it on their website (Specifically in their insurance policy) they will only cover any **USD** you have in your wallet, something you are struggling to understand?
**Stop** telling people to leave their coins on an exchange and **stop** telling people that it is also safe.
I, nor can the exchange make it any clearer for you to understand. Keep your coins on the exchange if you want to, but don't spread bullshit that it is both safe and secured if you do.

If you keep your money in a bank the interest rate should offset inflation? In Australia where I am from the reserve bank targets 2-3 percent inflation every year and my bank pays 2.8 percent interest every month on my balance.
I suppose you do also have to pay income tax on this.
Anyway with all the above being said, BTC is still superior as it is a deflationary asset. The issue with this is people don't want to spend it because the price will ultimately keep rising.

How often does he rebalance?
Also, I wish I could charge 2 percent to hold peoples cryptocurrency for them.

I didn't watch it, just scrolled through some comments. Might need to watch it when I am on my lunch break as it is quite long
EDIT: Ok I watched it. His argument is that it will take too long to an initial blockchain download as increasing the blockchain size will obviously make it grow quicker. He kind of defeated his own point because earlier in the video he spoke about pruning and getting the database down to 5GB or so.
However at present the blockchain is roughly 210GB. On a 100MB fiber connection that would take about 5 hours to download. On a 4G mobile connection about 6 and a half hours. Even if you had ADSL this at most would take 62 hours. The limitation there being your internet connection, not the size of the Bitcoin blockchain.

How long does validation take? Everyone has at least an i3 processor these days right?

Because your USD is insured if left on the exchange, but your cryptocurrency is not.

Ok but that doesn't explain why someone would sell their Bitcoin for a currency that is in hyperinflation.
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:16:57
That does not seem unreasonable to me.

You can close it and open it and it will pick up where it left off

The answer depends on the price you purchased it at.

Even if that is the case, he still should be able to withdraw?

What are you confused about?

I think the Bulgarian government holds a very big stash of BTC, something like 213,000 or more.

While you are correct he has many coins (Estimated 1.1M or so), they are spread across literally thousands of wallets, and he probably doesn't have the private key to these wallets anymore meaning the coins are forever lost.
But there is no way of knowing this for sure.

Do they not advertise their withdraw limits? Surely you would have known this before depositing and selling.
@_date: 2019-05-12 23:36:34
Yep then you are truly screwed.
Just look at Japan over the last 10 years.
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:09:46
He doesn't and never did have a single address, he has 50BTC sitting in over hundreds of thousands of different wallets.

1000 years? I think it will be obsolete in 20 years at the max.
