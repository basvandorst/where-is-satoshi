It’s safe to assume that the vast majority of its users are not downloading it to enter bogus data, that they are actually using for its intended purpose. Averaging out the ones who do end up entering bogus data. The margin of error should be tight enough to gain insight into market trends

I want bitcoin to succeed as much as anyone else here. However, most people don’t use their everyday currency as an investment in the way they do with bitcoin. People want to buy it and sell it like a stock, causing volatility, and volatility creates distrust, which perpetuates more volatility. With the amount of volatility how can we use it as a common currency? I hope I’m not coming across as a pessimistic downer. Just think it’s something worth discussing

Will the volatility stabilize with widespread? How or why? Would the value of bitcoin continue to rise with low volatility? What would stop users from dumping to buy other coins if they see other coins making bigger gains while bitcoin starts stabilizing? Also, another maybe unrelated question, when we reach the threshold of when it becomes impractical to mine more bitcoins, how do we maintain the integrity of the network? Since we will no longer have miners, as there will be no incentive to mine anymore? I’m still fairly new to the scene and just had these questions in my mind -sorry if these are common knowledge

I wish more people were like you. More importantly I wish it were easier to get unbiased facts in our daily streams
