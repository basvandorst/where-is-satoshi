I'll share my strategy with you, you can choose to follow it if you like. This is just the opinion of a random internet stranger, so take it with more than one grain of salt.
The initial expectation was that bitcoin would tank after the fork in favor of other crypto assets. While this did happen for a while, it was short-lived, and we are currently seeing a wave of profit-taking. 
I'm going to buy bitcoin if it falls to about 5230 (a strong support level), or if it rises above 5730 (a strong resistance level). 
Why am I planning on waiting until it rises to 5730 rather than investing now? That's because I am unsure of the direction the price will move in the near future. I'd rather jump in a bit later with surety of direction. 
I intend on holding until *just before* segwit2x, at which point I will liquidate my bitcoin holdings in favor of alt coins.

Right. This will be a long post, so **you have been warned!**
One of the biggest issues with bitcoin during recent years has been the slow transaction times. As more people adopt bitcoin, it becomes harder and harder to get the transactions processed in time. Each block in bitcoin is restricted to 1 MB in size, so as you can see there is an obvious cap on the amount of data that a block can hold.
A neat idea to help improve the data carrying capacity of these blocks was to implement *segregated witness* (SegWit), a technique by which the digital signatures of transactions were removed from the blocks and places separately. Simply put, this increases the effective size of each block by around 4x. This technique also sets up nicely for the implementation of *lightning networks*. 
Sounds good, right? Well, this is where there was a divide. Bitcoin miners got together and said that they would support the SegWit fork in July, but in return there would be another fork in November that doubled the *size* of each block from 1 MB to 2 MB (called SegWit2x). This was called the New York Agreement (NYA).
Most of the Bitcoin developers were against this idea.They believed that such a hard fork would be just a temporary and hasty fix. Increasing the block size would not affect miners who had dedicated farms for mining, but it would affect normal people who wish to set up Bitcoin nodes by making it doubly intensive on their computers. Also, there was a deeper-rooted political issue - letting a centralized group of miners dictate the terms of how Bitcoin should proceed further was against its decentralization principle.
Put all of this together, and you have the makings of a *contentious hard fork*, which is not supported by the community at large but supported by a large share of bitcoin's mining power.

We have a very negative view on bubbles. The general public thinks that they are terrible heralds of doom for any economy. 
That's simply not the case. Bubbles are *good*, and in most cases *beneficial* for a growing industry. It helps remove speculators and profit takers, and leaves behind investors who truly believe in the asset's potential. This helps in organic growth of the asset, and in turn, the industry.
My view is this - **let** Bitcoin be a bubble. I don't care. Will things crash by 50-60% in the short-term? Maybe. But that's nothing new. If we believe in the underlying technology, and continually work to improve it, there's no way the crash lasts forever. And we will definitely come out stronger in the end.
