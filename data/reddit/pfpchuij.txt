As long as people are talking we are winning. Subpar viewpoints won't receive as much attention as the good ones.

Despite a considerable effort on my end to try to discuss the intricacies and effects of interest rate policy to the people in my social circle there does not seem to be an interest in what is happening in/to the world. Therefore I am turning to the good people of Reddit. A question that keeps polluting my thoughts is the following: how will this 'interest rate game' end? I am not a big conspiracy theorist or doom-and-gloom philosopher or anything but this fiasco will inevitably, irrevocably turn sour. A few options that have crossed my mind.
\&gt; Will the masses that deem themselves a civilized society end up working for the central banks as all loans provided to the market via QE will have to be redeemed (the central banks are business people after all). They practically own the banks and the banks practically own the people via FIAT.
\&gt; will (hyper-)inflation occur leaving us all in financial ruin in the short to mid term? And more importantly what happens next?
\&gt; (D&amp;G disclaimer) will the current monetary system implode as did the Roman society's monetary system (sketched by Mike Malony's secret of money)?
\&gt; will global conflict be the only perceived solution by the government to distract from or psuedo-solve the problem?
\&gt; **your thoughts?**
IMO: Whatever your view is we are living in extraordinary times and no matter how hard I try I cannot seem to produce one scenario that gives me even the slightest possible positive outcome. Even if BTC is going to play a huge role in the future of our monetary system I think it is unreasonable to think that it is going to be a "be all end all" solution to the problem at hand. **This comment is not a tangent on BTC but merely serves to open the discussion of course :)**
TLDR: What are your postive and negative scenarios for our economic, financial and monetary future?

Yes of course, just some daydreaming on my end. Dutch government beware though...

You have your facts straight as far as I'm concerned &gt; that is exactly what we are speculating on right now. That effect might be same as in Japan however it'll likely be turbo-charged due to the reasons you have provided.

I totally agree with you. The Japanese economy is still soldiering on however they likelyhood of their future being positive or even market-based is very low (I believe they are the top 10 owner of 40% of the Nikkei). If that trend continues the government will end up owning everything and the good people of Japan will find themselves in neo-communism.
Isn't this just a time-bomb waiting to implode? In other words the common man will suffer the consequences of the mismanagement of the government? IMO the government is an empty factory filled with the hopes, dreams and future of the people however they are not motivated to look inside to see how the sausage gets made... metaphorically of course ;)

That is an excellent idea however I've tried it and it fell on deaf ears. As soon as I use the word "percentage of" and/or "money supply" their eyes go blank... Some people are just happy to sit and die in the cave (Plato)

Exactly! The buck stops here, meaning at the USD/EUR level. This is what I'm pondering on at the moment &gt; something has got to give, a sort of economical/financial singularity if you will.

I couldn't agree with you more. I've tried to put it in sesamestreet lingo and try to explain what it would mean in terms of their daily lives (i.e. their salary remaining the same (or even worse losing their jobs) while the groceries get x times more expensive). The most common response I get is "well, if that is the case we might as well enjoy the time we have now and deal with it later" or even worse "you need to loosen up, the government isn't going to allow for another recession". These are the moments where I feel the most dread. I worry for the people who watch too much television....

So you expect Bitcoin to be a one-on-one replacement for all fiat-currencies combined &gt; in other words, an end all be all solution?
@_date: 2019-09-12 15:17:01
If you don't mind me prying a bit, what are your thoughts on the governing bodies that allowed this to happen? Shouldn't we as Bitcoin/decentralization people take a step back from financial and monetary angle and be discussing how we can improve on the powers that be that allowed this to happen in the first place? I'll tee one up: what do you think of the government be managed on a blockchain where all decisions and prognoses are on an easily accessible and transparant blockchain where we, the people, are able to hold governments accountable to some degree.

Short and sweet! I hope you are right brother.
