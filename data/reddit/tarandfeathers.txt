Thank you again for the effort and clarity!

you're doing it wrong
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:51:43
Good info, especially on the hash rate indicator, thank you, I'll keep an eye on it. One more question though: couldn't those mining guys get too attached to BTC and bias their way into mining despite some eventual flaws in the BTC's long term dynamics?
Also, I keep reading on the BCH community (who for some reason are at war with BTC) that the BTC has some sort of an issue with the block sizes. What is the reality?
Note: I apologize if I ask nonsense. Even though am I one of the earliest adopters, I haven't spent much time in leaning all the intricacies of crypto money, I just hodl out of pure faith.

I know bits, but far from having educated opinions on the matter.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:55:26
Yeah, I know... but I am a bit of a gambler and shoot for the moon or nothing. Sold some on ATH (lucky!!) for the taste, but just a bit.

Man, this is the first thing I read in the morning and you brightened my day, thank you.
You may be surprised, but I am a very joyful person.

Can this stupid Lambo meme about Bitcoin go lower? No. I think this is the lowest and I really hope I will never see this imbecility again. I am subscribed to this sub to stay updated on the topic, not to laugh ad nauseam like a drunken Neanderthal to the same stupid joke over and over. Stop this absolute shit, please.

There are restaurants and inns up there, for tourists.

Lots of tourist businesses up there.

Oh! Right when I sold!
It's because I am Romanian and we are not just gypsies and stray dogs, these are just gross stereotypes.

Nope, I guess CA is a copycat of this one. Like Adidas versus Adibas.

Is it already here, lurking until then? If so, which would you say it is?
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:09:41
BTC will mostly probably dip along with the stock market - at least the logic and general opinion support this correlation.
@_date: 2019-08-14 14:05:46
Your plan scared the shit out of me as a hodler. There was never something this simple to boost your couple of thousands to millions. So the market will obviously decide otherwise, because it is never that intuitive. So take care.
@_date: 2019-08-22 11:27:39


Which can be a good trait. Never discount the greed which can make people FOMO even during a recession.

Dreaming about ATHs day-in-day-out is not the mark of a true hodler. Those who bet on BTC on long term are the ones watching the base trend line, not the spikes. Only the dumpers daydream about FOMO rallies.
@_date: 2019-10-06 11:01:27
The first 2 points are a bit paranoid tbh. The third one is brilliantly deconstructed by Andreas Antonopoulos when he said that it is the masses' apathy that makes Bitcoin hugely undervalued today. If all people wanted to buy some BTC, its value will stop increasing, because there is no way all the people in the world could get rich by hodling against each other. So whenever you hear people saying they don't know/don't care what Bitcoin is, BUY! If on the contrary your barber and high school ex friends call you to ask about it, SELL.

My biggest concern is a mutual reprisal against crypto orchestrated by banks, governments which will see their leverage over population gone. Crypto will not die, but could pass through its own Dark Ages.

I feel you, but it may be possible that the internet is way-way-way more viral than a coin - be it virtual and whatnot.  Don't forget that we were dealing with chats, cats, memes and porn back then.

So lame that it's almost good.

Linking bitcoin with any kind of political extremism is horrible for bitcoin. The best reason to drastically restrict it by the main powers.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:48:59
I am not a crypto wizard, but here are my 2 cents on the current situation.
I am a long time hodler (my first BTC buy was at 2$) and I've always trusted BTC as the currency of the future, and this dip won't change my mind.
The fiat transaction fees are huge, the speed of fiat transactions is slow, fiat currency could be manipulated and fiat currency is no more suited with the dynamics of the IT industry. Holding crypto is the safest way to store value and the blockchain technology behind it is the next step in managing global information. These reasons built my trust in BTC and I am not going to fall for the panic surrounding each dip.
Of course, we liked the speed of the bullrun from last year and the dream of getting rich overnight got very tempting. But investing in crypto is a long term affair and it's not for the short term speculators and for the faint hearted. It's not for those who select the current posts by "New".
So, I believe the bottom is close and a new ATH is coming - not this year, maybe not the next, but eventually it will happen, and this is all I need to believe in in order to hold tight. I did the same at each dip and I was right. Of course, the market cap will be huge, but the BTC is a tool that deserves that share.
Many people hate BTC because it's in our nature to reject something we haven't got the guts to invest in something that made others rich. Don't feed them. The investors in BTC were the bold, those who believe in future and they put their money were their beliefs were, and this is a merit that deserves its reward. Just wait, until the next bull run and see those detractors massively change their mind. And then, wait for the next dip to see them trolling BTC again. They will do this all the time and falling for them is denying your own convictions. Bitcoins are not tulips. They are maybe one of the most useful tools ever created and you are part of this revolution.

This shitty dumb meme is the thing I mostly hate about this sub, no matter the angle it is posted in. I would like to award Reddit potatoes to the stupid karma whores who post it.
@_date: 2019-09-11 11:45:14
Yeah, I know.. Still, I can't help trying, as its evolution so far follows a certain pattern.

Excellent idea! It's done :)

A few percent of these nuts get rich if their TA knowledge is solid. Asking them to "English please" is like asking any other technical niche to explain what they're doing to illiterates. The fault is their's though: they shouldn't talk like this out of their working hours. Aaaand, there are also a bunch of make believers who actually don't know what they're talking about. This is why trading is such an obscure realm.

19K has assured me I won't have financial problems, 49k would secure a lifetime stability (supposing nothing ugly will come up), and 89K would allow me to indulge in a more abundant lifestyle.
P.S. Don't suppose I have heaps of coins. I am a modest guy and don't require much to be happy.

I guess you would like less volatility and are right. But hey, hodl, don't check the prices and you won't see all of these short term shenanigans.

I simply love this awesome skepticism.

It makes sense, as they have trained for thousands of years to handle fiat and now here is a new animal in the show.
