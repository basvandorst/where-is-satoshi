I think it might actually, why would someone bother sending a bitcoin transaction to a key that snowden tweets out randomly. 
I think you are right in that its probably a hash of a file, but I think the bitcoin transaction may actually be a secondary verification method for the hash in case twitter is messing with it, or it could be some sort of acknowledgement by the receiving party.

What would happen if several armed men walked into the Coinbase office and tried to extort the keys as one would do in a traditional bank robbery. Your holdings in Bitcoins is probably more than what a dozen physical banks would have in cash. How secure are you physically, do you have armed guards, private security,etc.. ? What about the security of individual employees who has access to one of your presumably multisig keys?

That doesn't fix it. Transaction fees are never going to be static no matter what the block size is. 
Even if tx fees are low, you will always have people underestimate the fee during time periods of high usage.

The idea is that validation of the signature becomes optional. So now you can have a new class of nodes that validates everything except signatures. 
This doesn't jeopardize security because nodes that do not validate signatures already exists and its called SPV.

The problem is , you have no idea of knowing what the level 1 price is because order are executed in blocks and the only person that knows all the orders and the sequence it gets executed in is the miner of that block.
To make matters worse, if a miner happens to have the level 1 order, he can just decide to cancel it before yours execute if they decide that you have an information advantage. Any market maker would kill his own mother to get that kind of ability in traditional markets because it is a license to print money.

VISA , banking system, and carrying fiat around IS secure because there is a gigantic regulatory and enforcement regime attached to it that makes sure you follow the rules and puts you in jail if you don't.
Bitcoin is supposed to be a trustless system based on game theory and cryptography. It does not require a regulatory regime that costs billions of dollars to maintain. 0-confirm is not trustless, and it will never be trustless! Thus it is exactly the same as using fiat, and any system bulit around fiat, because the only thing you can rely on is trust. In fact 0 confirm is worse than using VISA because bitcoin has no billion dollar regulatory regime attached to it that you can fall back on.  So if you want safe 0 confirm, go use VISA.

You seem to be missing the reason for the switch to SPV. It was because the  blockchain had grown too large and new full nodes would take forever to sync up. 
Bigger blockchain (either with normal accumulation every 10 minutes or by increasing block size limit) -&gt; More SPV's -&gt; Less full nodes.

Well, there are full blocks, and the sky isn't falling as people are claiming. In fact the network is behaving as expected by delaying low priority (no fee tx's) transactions. Certainly the market doesn't care if there are a few blocks full here and there.

In the end you'd probably have to setup a relationship with an honest forger because you can't predict with 100% accuracy who is going to forge the next block due to forgers going offline, and you'd want to send them the transaction out of band.

Its neat but I'm not convinced that time locked encryption is practical for public use.

Double spending 0 confirms is already super easy. It doesn't take any knowledge to execute it, and if you do have knowledge or some special relations with a miner, its even easier. 
So as an analogy, its like we have a cabinet with a very flimsy plastic lock that anyone can break open. It doesn't really prevent anyone from going into the cabinet. All it does is give you an illusion of security. If we enable RBF, we'll be removing that flimsy lock, but we are not really any less secure because the lock was easy to break anyways.

Eventually, some smart miner is going to implement RBF, and a wide variety of other solutions that can't be provided through the bitcoin p2p network, as a service and make a decent chunk of change.

The network already is able to handle "spam" or whatever you wanna call it. If your fee is not sufficient and the network is congested , it gets pushed to the back of the queue, and it'll be confirmed when there is no congestion. That's how it'll work whether the block size is 1 kilobyte or 100 gigabytes.

@_date: 2015-12-02 15:47:48


CPFP has a lot of problems. They are summarized here : 
The main problem I see is that in time of network congestion resulting in a transaction fee increase, CPFP makes the congestion worse because you are creating a second transaction on top of the first. Thus RBF is the most efficient way to get a transaction unstuck.  
@_date: 2015-12-01 22:07:18
Yes RBF can be used to double spend, but Voorhees ignores the fact that it can also be used to make a zero confirm transaction more likely to receive a confirmation. 
How else are you going to push through a low fee transaction during network congestion? For example we've had a lot of spam attacks on the network recently and I'm sure shapeshift has experienced first hand the downside of having a transaction stuck in the mempool for a long time.  Isn't this also a potentially debilitating problem for bitcoin busineses?

Its a good solution I think. Nodes can have the option to just download checkpoints up to a certain point in time and from there they'll run a full node. I think me and other people who are arguing against larger block sizes want to see these kinds of solutions first before we think about increasing block sizes. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:50:03
It would only be easier if there was a constant transaction fee. Note that at any block size, the attacker still has to compete with people that use the blockchain for legitimate uses. If people are willing to pay a higher fee than the attacker is willing to pay, than the DOS will fail.
Anyways, there are many kinds of DOS attacks that you can perform, what you are talking about is one out of many. Mostly the blocksize increase naysayers are worried about a traditional DDOS against the actual network which involves flooding full nodes with packets which is easier if there are less full nodes on the network.  
@_date: 2015-05-07 03:47:52
It matters a lot. You can't run a cryptocurrency without developers in the face of attackers and competing cryptocurrencies. Ask all the alt-coins why they failed and you'll get the same answer. They either lacked technical capabilities to keep the network going or were out competed.

The largest cost for a payment hub would be regulatory compliance, which an operator can choose to ignore and run through Tor instead. The capital cost is as large as the operator wishes his payment hub to be. If the operator wants a VISA like network, of course it will be expensive. But it can also be as small as the operator wants and he can run it through raspberry pi only processing txs for a small group of his friends.

Which will reduce the number of full nodes and make it easier for the government to shut down the whole thing ... higher block size is not a magic bullet. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:35:17


the cost is zero. There's nothing stopping miners from filling up blocks now with junk. This attack has happened before on alt coins such as monero. It hasn't happened on Bitcoin because of altruism but that doesn't protect us against well equipped adversaries who are undoubtedly going to attack Bitcoin when it starts to compete with national monetary policies. 
Sure there are ideas to incentivize full nodes. We should put them in place first before we start implementing ideas that is going to drastically reduce their numbers. 
ADD: disc technology, or more specficially cost per megabyte, has stopped scaling with Moore's law (called Kryder's law in the hard disk industry) since around 2010.

@_date: 2015-05-06 00:50:48
The majority of people won't ever care that they are directly accessing the blockchain or not. People right now don't even care about it. Its just handwaving to say that increase block size =&gt; more users =&gt; more full nodes. There's no evidence supporting any of those steps.

I suggest : ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2015-05-18 14:39:23
I'm very optimistic about Altcoins. The primary reason is that you cannot optimize a single cryptocurrency for all use cases. This is due to the fact that optimizations of a single parameter result in trade offs that makes other aspects of the cryptocurrency worse. The blocksize argument is a perfect example of this. Bigger block size means more txs, but also creates larger blocks to store and less full nodes. There are many other such tradeoffs such as privacy vs transparency, inflation vs deflation, etc.. This means that people with different needs will flock to whatever coin that meets their needs. 
I think the importance of network effects are overstated. A cryptocurrency still has utility even if it is only used by two people to keep track of their credit/debt between themselves. If you think of it as a decentralized database than you can see how certain cryptocurrencies can succeed without a large userbase.

They don't need to have 51% to artificially increase the blocks they mine. The problem is that miners are compensated through subsidies and tx fees from real transactions for mining the block, but the full node and miners that didn't get to mine the block  are not compensated at all.
If you increase block size, full nodes are going to decrease  without a question. They have been for a while now even with just this 1mb limit.

@_date: 2015-05-04 02:40:42


Larger block sizes inevitably means that less people will be able to run full nodes and that mining becomes more expensive for smaller miners. This contributes more to centralization in my view. If we keep block size as it is, people will just have to pay higher transaction fees if they want to use Bitcoins without an off chain service but at least they have a choice. If we are lacking decentralization in the miners and nodes, than Bitcoin users don't have a choice at all.

I keep hearing Moore's Law type arguments regarding this debate, but Moore's law is deccelerating. Hard disk space , or more specficially cost per megabyte, has stopped scaling with Moore's law (called Kryder's law in the hard disk industry) since around 2010. 
There's a reason why the HDD industry has consolidated to two companies now. Its because the cost of innovation has increased drastically in the industry.  I frankly would not expect this duopoly market structure to provide us with radically new improvements in tech every year.

The problem is that no one gets paid for relaying transactions, and memory is a scarce resource. Gavin's solution is to increase the block size so that the transactions go into blockchain (disk space).  This solution makes no sense to me because no one gets paid for storing blockchain data either so you've just handed off the problem to a different section of the computer. 
Why not actually just pay people for reliably relaying transaction data? Without economic incentives, its actually proper behavior for full nodes to drop long unconfirmed transactions. You cannot expect people to do things for free if we want to keep the system decentralized. Its just not going to happen.

Bad actors will take advantage of "planned network upgrades", aka hard fork. I suspect that they will see a similar attack again if BCH continues this path.

I think he's too optimistic honestly. New chip fabrication is not necessary, you just need to co-opt the current miners. And we can't just switch the POW smoothly, we need people to be alerted that there is a new software that forks from the compromised main chain, and we need people to download them and use it. Meaning that any attempt to 51% attack the chain is going to be followed up by a massive disinformation campaign and censoring, which many governments are already very good at doing (see Russia, China).
But he's definitely right about one thing, it would require a government that can do IT.

If you can find a way to facilitate Atomic cross chain transfers without introducing a hard fork , that isn't affected by tx malleability, you've solved a problem that a fair number of people have bashed their head against. 
Gox could fix its system to not be affected by tx malleability. If they had kept the vulnerability open, and if they had enough liquidity, someone could have cleaned them out for a lot more. In this case the entire architecture relies on there not being tx malleability issues.

First thing, this is a decentralized crypto to crypto exchange. So no fiat. That's the fault of the OP, the author of the project makes it pretty clear its crypto to crypto only. 
Second, its not a "fully" decentralized exchange at all because the order book and matching engine is on a centralized server  ( you DDOS that server, you can't trade). 
What is decentralized is the settlement portion of the exchange, which is nice since it means that you don't have to deposit your coins in a exchange controlled address, meaning that a hacked exchange doesn't compromise your coins. Unfortunately, this relies on what's called a "Atomic Cross Chain Transfer" which relies on there being no transaction malleability  (yes, the same thing that mt. gox claimed to have suffered).
This is not ready at all for prime time, and may never be ready with this kind of architecture. I think most core developers will tell you the same thing about any project that relies on transaction malleability to not exist. So use at your own risk.

a) businesses and individuals deciding to not deal with coins from certain addresses. This is unavaoidable, but not necesarily a bad thing. Individuals should have the right to decide who they do business with. Unfortuantely, US companies must follow US laws, so a blacklist is of course going to be implemented. 
b) Miners blacklisting addresses. Miners can prevent transactions from happening at all by blacklisting addresess. But as long as you can convince one miner to include the transaction in their block, your transaction will eventually finds its way on the blockchain. So as long as the mining of bitcoin remains decentralized, it will be impossible to blacklist your address on the blockchain. 
So in summary, your address can selectively be blacklisted by any individual on the network, but your address cannot be blacklisted from the entire network.

Well bitfury is part of this blockchain alliance so you are wrong.
The good news is that as long as there is one miner that is willing to mine your transaction, you can't be completely censored (and assuming there is no 51% attack)

Quickly skimmed the paper so someone should expand, but threshold signature allow you "n of m" type signing within a single ECSDA key pair, unlike multisig which uses 1 ECSDA key pair but signer. This means you can send "n of m" type transactions using the standard pay to pub key transaction. 
Kind of seems a bit redundant, but there could be use cases when the user is really concerned about obfuscating the fact that they are using multisig on the blockchain.

A more crude explanation: 
Wow these guy wasted a fuck ton of energy on this particular instance of the blockchain. More so than the others, they must be right.

That's a huge allegation and coinfire has been right about these kinds of things in the past. I'm not surprised honestly because cryptsy doesn't have the insider connections and creds with lawyers, regulators, and bakers to run such an operation, regardless of whether they've done anything wrong or not. 
And you know there is bad news anytime someone threatens legal actions publicly. No one with proper legal counsel is going to do that.

Atomic cross chain transfer is used by Mercury for settlement (after you submit an order and is matched up with a counterparty). 
Tx malleability allow you to make their refund tx invalid. Which means a malicious counter party can lock you out of your coin forever, although they can't steal it from you.

This is a proposal for a low energy blockchain with an external authority that ties mining address to a person's identity. 
At that point, you might as well just use a SQL database. No need to fuck around with blocks or chains. Better yet, open up a bank account at your nearest bank.

You should never run other people's trading bots. Its the dumbest thing you can do, like playing poker with your card face up and letting guy next to you make calls.
At least this one is open source, which basically means that its worthless and probably not malicious. But if you haven't closely examined the code you should assume its malicious.

2) I don't know. Ask coinbase with a warrant, they'll tell you.
3) if HW wallets are so secure, than how come people keep getting hacked? It's because people do not know how to secure their Bitcoins. 
4) Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV. 
5) Send me a satoshi or even better half of a satoshi... Ill wait

It remains to be seen whether the transaction fees and technical costs of bitcoin can be cheaper than the bureaucracy involved with traditional finance.

Sorry whoever made this is either an idiot or a Bitcoin Cash supporter. Likely both. The only problem Bitcoin solves is 1) Fiat being prone to inflation and mismanagement and 2) Transaction Censorship (not listed in comic).
2)Bitcoin is not private. There is far more work that needs to be done to make it so.
3)Bitcoin is stupidly easy to hack. Probably easier than traditional banking systems.
4)Bitcoin has already splintered into a bunch of shitcoins.
5)Digital fiat is infinitely divisible. Various markets list assets for fractions of pennies all the time.
6)Bitcoin needs transaction fees in order to provide censorship resistance. 
7)It remains to be seen whether Bitcoin solves any problem that the "unbanked" has. If their problem is that they lack the initial capital to get into the system, than Bitcoin is unlikely to solve their problem.
