The article says that someone who has received a large inheritance would be smarter to invest it all into a market that "has a tendency to rise over time" all at once rather, than sitting on it and investing a little at a time over a longer period.
It also said that dollar cost averaging works best for people who can only invest a little at a time into a more volatile market. By "investing a set amount of money each month ensures that you will buy more shares when they are low and fewer when they are high. You may even show a gain in a market that is flat or down a bit."

I have a recurring payment set up at Coinbase where I automatically buy $50 worth every other Friday. Every 4 or 6 weeks I log into Coinbase, move the BTC to my wallet, and update my spreadsheet.

I started in January '14. About the worst time to start. There were a few months were Coinbase wasn't approving the transactions, when they went to the new risk assessment algorithm. Other than that I've been sticking with it, for the most part. I like that every time I buy, I get more BTC. I just try to ignore the fact that my avg $/BTC is 1/2 what I could sell them for today. Whenever someone brings that up I just shut my eyes, stick my fingers in my ears, and yell LALALALALALA.

It comes out on payday. No real strategy. I believe dollar cost averaging works best with smaller transactions more often. I have it set up for every other week because I get paid every other week. I would do it weekly if I were paid weekly.

Someone logged on to the site as Dread Pirate Roberts months after Ross was in prison.

It's because he never did it and there was no evidence that he did. As I remember it, it was actually a State agent that did the threatening.

He never tried to hire assassins. That was a lie so that the jury would convict him. The judge decided he was guilty before the trial started. She even forbade the defence from defending him. The trial was a mockery and proof positive that there is no such thing as a justice system in the United States.
