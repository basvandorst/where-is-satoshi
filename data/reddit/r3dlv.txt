The node is behind a personal VPN :)

I am using a cluster of Raspberry Pi 3B+'s and yeah i really recommend upgrading to a 3. I read that the old boards had some power and performance issues, so i wouldn't use them
@_date: 2018-08-25 14:02:48
Finally set up my own Lightning and full node yesterday! (Visible in the background.) The RaspiBolt guide by Stadicus really helped along, kudos to them!
Feel free to connect to my node and open a channel: 03d212a039e89308ac2d4542fc7aaaff3ea9d6149b90badb68b48b7b64a7a370b7

Yep, its a RPi cluster, but not for Kubernetes :^)
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:39:13
Well, im no expert by any mean, but if we add up all the specs of each board, the cluster has a "logical" 32-core CPU running at 1.2Ghz, and 8 GB of RAM, with each board having a potential of achieving 1Gpbs of network throughput. So i'd say it can process data around at the same speed as a average 8-core 3.3ghz server. But in your case, i'd rather look at something like the Odroid XU4, if you want to build a cluster

Ah, i let the bitcoin software download the chain, then i sent the files to a external hard drive so i dont have to sync it on the Pi :)
@_date: 2018-08-25 14:39:59
Yes, of course! I synced Bitcoin Core 0.16.2 on my PC, took about 7 hours, then transferred it to a Samsung EVO 860 SSD which i purchased specifically for this cause, which i attached to the host Pi using a USB to SATA adapter.

Oh, that seems to be an issue exclusive to the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet app. There is an optional feature called data-loss-protect, when opening a channel with a node which supports it there is an easy way to get the money back from lost channel in case of emergencies like phone loss. Bitcoin Lightning Wallet requires this feature to be supported by peer but so far very few nodes support it on testnet and mainnet.

Well, in theory a lightning node CAN generate you some income from routing fees, but the fees are really insignificant. The main focus of running one is to support the Lightning Network, while also gaining access to lapps and instant payments via LN
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:47:33
Nice cope thread, OP.
@_date: 2018-08-25 18:55:04
Its not a bad feature per se in my opinion, but it shouldnt be implemented in a mobile wallet if most daemons dont have it supported
@_date: 2018-08-20 14:37:12
Bisq/Bitsquare all the way. Its a really underrated platform.
@_date: 2018-08-26 09:46:28
Not as far as i know
@_date: 2018-08-25 18:45:29
Sure thing :D The XU4 is arguably the fastest price-to-performance SBC currently available, being around 4 times as efficient as the RPi3B+
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:27:51
Alright, all up and running!

Yeah, the 20-ish companies, or "Liquid members" as they are called, are mainly exchanges/cryptocurrency trade companies. LBTC to BTC is like the dollar pegged to gold, in a way. Kind of anti-Bitcoin in my opinion, since users should not trust central parties, even if multiple, but i guess Liquid is meant for high volume transfers between exchanges and not so for end users. As said:


@_date: 2018-10-14 17:07:31
Cons: Centralized/"Federated" between multiple parties, introduced subscription fees which go to the named parties in the WP
Pros: Fast transfers, takes load off the main blockchain
@_date: 2018-10-13 09:03:42
Lightning Network is a payment network on top of Bitcoin, as a second layer. You send your bitcoin accross the network nodes, and because transactions only get published on chain when you close the channel, it allows for instant transfers. Its decentralized, scalable, and allows instant transactions for sub satoshi fees. On the other hand, Liquid is also a payment network, but its a little different.
I wouldn't use Liquid. In my opinion, it goes against the philosophy of bitcoin. Its a trusted and permissioned system. You have to TRUST multiple parties, with the fees instead of going to the miners, go as subscription fees to the "Liquid members." Kind of reminds me of the current banking system.

Cope harder, ABC is LN compatible. Even so, it seems to be working great without it.

Well crypto markets are pretty unpredictable as can be seen. I am not expecting it to go that low, but i certainly wouldn't be surprised if it does
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:31:08
thats what they said about 4k
