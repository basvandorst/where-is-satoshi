You are joking right? "Not sure we'll recover from this"

You vastly overestimate a walk-in's worth to the bank. The banks know what makes them the most money. Thats why they have sold off handling of traditional accounts to global business process outsourcing companies. You will be talking to people from ACT or Teletech if you need help with your account. Either in some minimum wage call center in the states, or in mexico or the phillipines. That's how much they care about walk-ins and product sales to these people like loans/credit cards/new accounts.
[Look at how much they care](
I'm pretty sure the big 4 know what they are doing. They know what is important to their business. It's not walk-ins. They don't even bother to secure your information if you have an account there, beyond what they can claim for liability purposes.

Then why do they have to trade inside a walled garden? Oh right, because if they traded with "the outsiders" then they wouldn't have complete control over the market.

In one case, we have influence. Even if it's a tiny amount. They have to face our buy and sell orders, even if they are dwarfed by the much larger amounts from larger institutions.
In the other, we have none. They can ignore us and set their own prices, which they know other people will follow.
This is absolutely a critical issue.

I think you misread my post. The exchange is only for large institutions, like Bank of America, JP Morgan, etc. You aren't allowed. Basically, only the people who ran the economy into the ground are allowed to trade in mass volume and set the price of the currency.

They have over 50% of the hashrate. That is not "splendidly" that is directly threatening the validity of the bitcoin network. The moment they crossed over that threshhold they have been holding a knife to the network's neck.
They are a bad actor and need to be removed. There are a number of ways they can manipulate the network now, and none of them are "splendid".

No. People will look to them the same way they did gox prices, because of the undoubtedly high volume.
They will essentially be able to drastically influence the bitcoin value from within their walled garden. We will have no recourse in this. If they want it to crash, it will crash, if they want it to rise, it will rise.
This is beyond some manipulation of value. It's on a larger scale than we've ever experienced before. I'm not very happy with that prospect.

They don't care about it.

They have to deal with your buy and sell orders.
You still have influence. It may not be a lot of influence against the kind of money they bring to the table, but it's still influence nonetheless.
In their planned setting, you have no influence at all. They can ignore whatever prices you buy or sell at, and understand that with their volume the other exchanges will follow their price lead.
Basically, they secure their power over the market and make themselves untouchable. They will have great leverage over anyone holding bitcoins since they can dictate the prices by mass volume trading among themselves.

If you hold a knife to someone's neck, even if you extra pinky promise you won't cut them, that still makes you a bad actor.
They knew they were threatening the bitcoin network and did it anyway. Then they said "so what?"
They willingly threatened compromise of the blockchain. Their reasoning doesn't matter (oh we won't do anything we promise). They crossed the 50% line. That's unacceptable.
Changing a decentralized currency into a centralized one is not helping Bitcoin, and I honestly don't see how anyone that has been here for any deal of time could accept that. I've been with bitcoin for a bit over 4 years now, and the amount of people now seemingly okay with giving up a core function of bitcoin by just...handing over controls to some pool owner, astounds me.
The number of things they could do with over 50% hash that would wreck bitcoin is not small. They could effectively deny every other pool from getting valid blocks, to get people to switch to them, and make themselves the ONLY option for mining. They could deny confirmation of any transactions they wished to. They could use the power to do any of these things, or merely the threat of them, for business leverage. 
There are a multitude other ways they could abuse it as well, and many of their options would be difficult to detect. Yet people seem OKAY with this. And I'm confounded as to why.
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:47:54
Nothing you say at this point can fix that Ghash held a knife to the bitcoin network's throat. Even if you pretty pinky sweared not to cut, it doesn't change that you took control of the bitcoin network and could possibly compromise the blockchain at any time. 
That is incredibly damaging. I think a hardfork may be the only option left now after you caused this incident. Whether it be removal of pool mining or something else, there has to be a solution now. A bad actor like ghash can't put a knife to the network's throat again. It's terribly damaging to confidence in the currency.

It's not fine by me. With their undoubtedly high volume, they can essentially fix the price of bitcoin to whatever they please, and influence the other markets that we have access to outside their walled garden.
People will look at them the same way they looked at gox for prices. And they will freely manipulate the market like we've never seen in the cryptocurrency community.
It's basically handing over the reigns from the whole community over to the largest financial institutions that ran the economy of a nation into the ground.

I think it's better to hardfork bitcoin to a non-outsourcable puzzle. Just kill all pools outright. It was assumed large pools would be rational good actors-and this shows not all are. Better to do it now than have problems from this later.
Or hardfork bitcoin to completely remove PoW entirely. Either would be preferable to the current situation.
Either way, this needs to be resolved ASAP. Delaying it will only make it worse when we have a bad actor with a knife at the bitcoin network's throat.

Corporations will use all tools they can to eliminate competition and maximize profits. That includes using regulatory agencies if they can capture them.

Yes, like when the EPA was created they favored the special interest groups "Environmentalists" and "The Average Person that enjoys clean water, air, and earth".

It would be foolish to abolish agencies that were created to, and successful solved SERIOUS and KNOWN problems that happened historically without them. They are fixes. Rather than removing the fixes because they don't work well enough, it's better to try and improve them.
We know how bad it is without them. Ignoring history isn't smart. Look at how many problems China is having right now with pollution. The companies that killed hundreds or even thousands of people through their harmful byproducts can stall off legal proceedings until most or everyone involved is dead, and then settle with the remaining few for chump change. They never have to bear responsibility, and it has been repeatedly written off as a "tragedy of the commons".
