Higher than coinbase?
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:25:01
What’s the difference?

I’m glad i decided to ask here to narrow down everything. Blogs are full of words that I don’t understand. It’s good to have some idea about where to start and what exactly to search for. Thank you all! Very helpful..

Your highness i’m sorry if people are not pro in reddit as well..geez, how old are you? So much anger in there..
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:28:13
Yikes. I thought i’d ask here instead of mistakenly trusting a site that will scam me. It’s honestly very easy to make a website nowadays. I don’t want to be a victim of hackers.

Thank you! Very helpful.. i will read about it.
@_date: 2019-07-21 02:00:07
You are amazing! Thank you!
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:28:52
Thank you! I will look into it.

So another follow up question... if i buy bitcoin from another site..can i combine it with what i currently have? Does it work that way?
@_date: 2019-08-05 09:56:52
That’s why i am asking?
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:02:06
This is the exact question i had but i only got rude replies here. It seems like this thread is full of people who thinks they are better because they started bitcoin early.
@_date: 2019-08-05 09:59:08
When i bought it at 7k, i sold it at 10k and then it went up to 13k. ��
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:10:15
So that’s the reason why you don’t sell!
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:02:52
I’m ok if you call me bitcoin ignorant. �� that’s how people start to learn, they ask to narrow down all the information they can find and make their own conclusion. So far your comment is stupid and not helpful at all. ����������
@_date: 2019-08-05 09:57:30
I know but i only experienced the 13k.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:46:28
�� you have a lot of anger..
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:22:03
Nobody made it clear why.. i asked a few times. I only get rude replies. It would be really helpful if somebody will share a link or a blog post explaining why holding on to it is better than trading instead of just being plain rude and make you feel stupid for not knowing.
