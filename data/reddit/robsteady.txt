Well there have been multiple reports of the death of Bitcoin over the course of history.
@_date: 2016-06-05 01:03:42
I don't think it will get that high, but I'd take it. Who knows, though...
@_date: 2016-06-12 12:16:29
or... Intel want to make a chip to mine Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-06-04 19:47:08
Well you can play the hi/low game and try to make money or you can just leave them sitting around, going up in value. It's up to whether you want to sit around watching the price or just wait for it to get there. 
I'm not selling because I believe in the long-game of bitcoin. I believe the value will continue to rise overall, and I can wait for it.
@_date: 2016-06-27 15:41:31
I might need to make [this]( a quick link to post to people more often.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:41:46
I don't watch the price to see how much fiat I can get for selling it, I watch it to know how much stuff I can buy with it.
@_date: 2016-06-04 18:29:34
You can call me Mr. Caulfield because I'm Holden... Yeah, I just did that. 
Seriously though, I'm not planning to play the price volatility. I'm keeping it around and spending (not selling) little pieces of it off from time to time and keeping the rest around to generate interest and earnings from loans.

Fair enough, it's just always ironic that the poem/rhyme is critical of the plot yet people use it as a rally call to rebellion. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 00:31:37
I first heard about it a few years ago from Jupiter Broadcasting but didn't really think about it/pay any attention to it back then. A few months ago I decided to start paying attention to and playing around with bitcoin. I buy a few dollars worth every week now and I'm hoping to turn it into even more of an investment within the next year... gotta get the wife convinced it's a good move and not just something I'm playing with.
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:11:51
So... you're saying the cops are going to find a way to stop this "powder keg" before it manages to create any real mayhem? The story of Guy Fawkes isn't one of rebellion, it's one of failure.
@_date: 2016-06-05 00:59:28
Yeah logging in to Steam was pretty hard for my wife when her phone took a bath and she couldn't access the authenticator... man... that Steam security stuff...
@_date: 2016-06-24 22:38:08
oh no... the mark of the beast... better get rid of that stuff before you succumb to the wicked ruler of the Earth... feel free to send your remaining bitcoin balance to 1GeUXk3kiegxNoSoyfS7xzx8yMCMEmLxW7 to prevent your banishment from eternal bliss...

TBH, I don't know. I've never lost anything, but it is still a public exchange so just keep that in mind. I'm a tiny fish and I'd bet there are much larger swimmers floating around here that may be able to answer that question more precisely.
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:17:11
I know this will fall on deaf ears, but since I don't see anyone saying they haven't had any issues, I'll do so. I haven't purchased large amounts of bitcoin through coinbase, nor have I sold off any more than $20 to be deposited back into my bank account. 
Even though I haven't had any issues, I am taking into account all of what I've been reading at this sub lately. I recently purchased the Shift card and I've been enjoying the functionality so any problems would be a let down. 
Am I the only person who hasn't had an issue with coinbase worth stating or is everyone else just quiet?
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:45:06
Honestly, major download motion is a mistake. I believe the true value is much higher, it's just taking time for everyone else to accept it and be willing to pay that much.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:13:52
Nah, I put an order through this morning and it processed fine.
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:35:31
... this is reddit...
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:27:13
It was an instant buy with a debit card.
@_date: 2016-06-03 14:15:52
I do small purchases weekly, move some out to other places, keep some there and do small transactions with my Shift card. I've only had the shift card get denied at one place the day after using it for two small purchases. I haven't tried the card again since the denial but I'm assuming it was something with the way that gas station runs their cards.
I've also been reading all the negative posts about coinbase and getting a little uneasy. I don't plan to ignore what everyone is saying, but I also don't plan to jump ship yet.
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:22:23
... it's already back up.
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:13:20
I've only been here a little while, but I've looked at the history so this is pretty much how I've been looking at it.
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:52:24
Wow, okay, well since you're offering...

Happy cake day!

Besides, the site says finance accounts start at 6.8, work up to 8 by the sixth month of investment. Also, the regular wallet generates 3%, not 8 and you need a minimum deposit of 10BTC for the finance account. Doesn't sound like what you're looking for.
You could visit Poloniex where you can lend bitcoin for traders to use, currently the APR is around 7-8% ... you could also check out BTCPOP which has a savings account with a 5% APR...
@_date: 2016-06-27 21:13:10
Considering there is dispute due to the fact that some early manuscripts read 616, nah... granted, a lot of us are whacky enough to call bitcoin the devil, it is allowing a new form of trade which they received the mark for...
@_date: 2016-06-08 10:15:51
Coinbase allows it now.
@_date: 2016-05-19 16:10:46
Coinbase now offers instant buy with debit card, maybe worth checking into again.
@_date: 2016-05-26 14:35:48
Yeah, not being able to get the SMS working would definitely be an issue. I've had a decent experience with Xapo as far as I've used it, but I've only accepted and sent a few small amounts with the wallet.
I was looking at Wirex as well before I ordered the Shift card. I don't remember exactly why I went with Shift over it, probably just because I had heard about Shift first.
Thanks for the input.

I'm working on keeping a list of the places I have my coin deposited and making sure my wife knows how to access each of those places in case of an unfortunate event. Of course, there's always the issue that 2FA is enabled in as many places as possible and the authenticating device is always with me so depending on what does me in that could be in danger as well...
@_date: 2016-05-18 02:15:11
To be perfectly frank, it would be a miracle if you made anything mining.
@_date: 2016-05-26 17:05:01
This part of why I the issue with POS. I also doubt the longevity of a POS coin, but that's  another thread.
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:04:48
I refuse to trust sites with really poor grammar and spelling. I think it looks suspicious, but it's your money, risk it as you please.
@_date: 2016-05-24 00:29:00
They can either install the Circle app as well and you can send it there or they can use some other wallet.
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:51:51
Sure you can, it's called arbitrage.
@_date: 2016-05-25 13:02:07
I got the Shift card that hooks up with Coinbase recently, used it a few times with now issue. Considering all the dust-up around Coinbase recently I may have to keep an eye on this.
@_date: 2016-05-19 16:19:45
What kind of math is 2016 - 6 = 2013?
@_date: 2016-05-26 14:37:55
I was looking at BitPay as well. Seems a little more "legit" than some of the other options, but it seems like they want to cater more to businesses, which I'm not. Is it just my interpretation or are they more focused on serving business customers?
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:42:18
This is most likely the way I will go in the long-run. I don't have enough to be super concerned right now, but as my holdings grow, I'll definitely be going this route.
@_date: 2016-05-26 20:04:26
It can be. You have to look at the fees and do the math to find out if it's worth it.
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:26:17
Yep, yep. I've got it down to two or three places right now. The catch will be getting my wife to understand how it works.
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:18:02
I know plenty of Germans with perfect English skills.

Does Spotify host podcasts now?
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:25:29
Interesting. It's been a while since I've used Spotify. Now I'm curious how much work is involved in getting a podcast listed there. Music is a pain to get up but I hope these would be easier.
@_date: 2016-05-17 21:30:04
1) No computer that someone would get suckered into using as a hidden miner would be powerful enough to mine.
2) Mining takes 100% CPU so you could potentially fry someone's device, therefor causing them harm and making it NOT free for the user.

I don't even know what was displayed behind him, and I can see it.
@_date: 2016-05-24 17:59:32
Considering DuckDuckGo tells me Number26 is "Europe's most modern bank account" I'm going to assume he knew.
@_date: 2016-05-19 15:34:49
Coinbase or Circle...
@_date: 2016-05-26 18:18:47
Yeah, I didn't mean to indicate I felt coinbase was less legitimate, I only started using them because I first heard of their age and reputability. I think I've just seem BitPay mentioned as a payment processor more than I have coinbase, that's really what I was getting at.
@_date: 2016-05-26 14:36:33
Yeah, I had wanted to go with Xapo originally but got disappointed they didn't ship to the States. I randomly went to the site yesterday and saw they offered it now.
@_date: 2016-05-19 16:12:32
The same thing as what would happen to any other digital property. What would happen to your mp3s, pictures, movies/videos... It's not like the "bitcoin foundation" or the IRS will seize your bitcoin and not allow anyone else to have it.
