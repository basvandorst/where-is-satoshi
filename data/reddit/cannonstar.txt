75% is higher than what bitcoin core consider to be 'consensus' these days imo.

Who's this 'we' you're claiming to b e? I never claimed to be a supporter of Classic nor am I being paid to discredit anyone. All I'm doing is exposing you as a doublespeaker, that's all. Everything else is a product of your paranoia and emotional outbursts. You should check into a mental hospital, you seem like an unhinged person with lots of fantastic theories with no basis in reality. I should have guessed that from your username.

Doublespeak is strong with this one.
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:06:44
*yawn* You're not fooling anyone, buddy.

The reason you haven't seen any intelligent conversation is because this subreddit actively censors any conversation of it. How's that for looking at the actual situation? I'm not derailing anything, just calling them like I see 'em.

Gox took a while to fall, I'm not calling it yet.

Your doublespeaks are pretty cringey, I'm embarrassed for you.

^ Now my dear readers, this is what butthurt looks like. 
Edit: nice ninja edit. 
If you deny there was any censorship, then I'm not gonna bother slinging shit at you any further because, like you say, it's a waste of time.

Nope, I'm a longtime hodler (I've mined a couple of BTC with my shitty stone age GPU, that should tell ya how long I've been around) who's tired of the community infighting and misinformation (which is what I'm accusing you of causing). All the accusation of shilling and derailment is all in your head, buddy.
Nobody except you are reading this, so why not take your own advice and stop wasting our time with this?

If this is true, then I'm gonna start using zoho for my side business.

I'm having a hard time understanding this chart too. 
What's a good resource to learn about these kind of charts?
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:20:38
Thanks for this. I've been using the order books to assist with my trading. It's good thing to know that order books can be manipulated to dupe traders like me.

It was never dead to begin with.

Is there a github repo or two I could go look at for research/building an arbitrage bot?

From the article, your fiat money is protected up to the first $100,000 in your account. However any amount over $100,000 in your account is at risk for "bail-in".
Am I reading this right?
