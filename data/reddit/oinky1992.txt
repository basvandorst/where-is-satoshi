No. BcashSV isn't the real Bcash because Bcash isn't even real itself. All are trash coins anyway and unfortunately both BcashSV and ABC will be in the top 10 now.

Wow, either Chinese mining companies are closing or this. With the way this is going, China will probably only have like 2% of the network hash rate by the end of 2019 lool.

Seriously, FUCK PAYPAL. I lived in a shared house with other 5 other students while I was at Uni and Paypal limited/banned all our accounts and when we asked them why they said that Paypal does not need to tell us. Later on I found out that one of students was selling some dodgy shit and because we were all accessing our accounts from the same IP address it caused all of our accounts to be banned. THE FUCKED UP THING AS WELL IS THAT THEY TOLD ME I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO REMOVE MY BANK AND CREDIT CARD DETAILS FROM THE PAYPAL!!!!!! 3 YEARS ON AND ITS STILL ON THERE!!! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. 
I will forever support Bitcoin and forever hope that ShitPal dies.
