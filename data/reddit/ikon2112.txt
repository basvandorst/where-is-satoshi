I agree to an extent. Cryptos definitely can go to zero, but there's also a possibility that some will endure long term. The dot com bubble had a lot of losers, but some (Google, Amazon, etc) that survived and are doing great now.
That being said, it's naive to think that [insert crypto here] will 100% survive and moon. Bitcoin could be Facebook... or it could be Myspace.

Atomic swaps make it easier to trade cryptos, but that doesn't change the fact that each crypto is an independent system. A Bitcoin transaction isn't valid/seen on the Litecoin blockchain and vice versa.

I think none of the options you listed would realistically support Bitcoin as a stateless currency. The real answer would be libertarians.
Ron Paul sure loves his gold standard, but he even admitted that he saw Bitcoin as a potential replacement of the Fiat system. Sure he didn't give it a strong endorsement, but he at least recognized that it had potential. Beyond that, you probably won't find any other major party politician that would support Bitcoins stateless nature.

Yeah I think that's definitely possible, and given past candidates/presidents Trump probably is the most likely to be pro-crypto, with one exception. I think Andrew Jackson would definitely be pro crypto, given that he fought the 2nd national bank, claiming it was a corrupt monopoly.
It really was a shame Ron and Rand never got the momentum they deserved. I think libertarianism isn't ever going to get mainstream traction, people seem to resist the idea that the free market and competition can better solve problems than a single entity that has no competition or accountability.
I watched the Rick Perry conference, and I must say I was pretty surprised. I don't agree with Perry on a lot of things, but I couldn't agree more on his view of States rights. I've always been a big supporter of States having more control over laws. Each state has unique demographics, markets, and cultures that will be better served by their state government than the federal government. Plus at least I'd have the ability to find a state that might better [align with my ideology](

I think the real answer is that  (hopefully) miners realize that purposely spamming the network has an effect on the value of Bitcoin. Sure the price has been trending upwards, but how long are people going to pay $4,300 for a Bitcoin with fees this high?
On the topic of spam, it's pretty clear that *someone* is spamming the network. [This]( shows that (as of the time of this post) 37MB of the mempool contain fees at 1sat/byte. Half of the mempool has fees lower than 10sat/byte. That's a pretty cheap spam attack. Assuming all TX under 10sat/byte, it'd cost under 1 BTC, assuming that it wasn't a miner who could at least recoup some of the tx fees.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:39:28
I think the primary reason why most merchants exchange to fiat is because the price if Bitcoin is volitle, so they don't want to take the risk of losing profit. If a store has a tight profit margin, it would be reckless to hold BTC. Sure we all believe long term hodling is smart, but it's a tough sell to a lot of businesses who have a bottom line to meet.

All I said was that I doubt Trump (as president at least) would be supportive of a stateless currency. I said that because I just haven't seen enough evidence to prove otherwise, but maybe I'm wrong. I just find it difficult to believe that a politician could maintain any sort of power while openly supporting a system that would completely undermine the government's ability to fund wars and/or social programs without actually having the capital to back it up.
If Trump does manage to gut the executive departments, I will be very happy. I'm not very thrilled with his use of executive orders, but as a libertarian I guess beggars can't be choosers. 
The reason why I chose Ron Paul as an example of someone who would support a non fiat system is [because he's outright said it]( Plus, he has a long history of consistent views. He doesn't seem to fully understand cryptos, but he at least recognizes what Bitcoin is trying to do.
To be honest, I hope I'm wrong. I'd love to see candidates support a currency that isn't easily manipulated. I like to think that I'm a more practical libertarian, that I'd be willing to sacrifice at least some of my views if it meant I could see a candidate do some of the things I want. Maybe I was wrong and Trump actually will shrink the government, I just never felt very convinced in the election.
I haven't seen Rick Perry's speech, but I'll take a look at it now.

What other pool even lets users decide what to signal for? Slush didn't have to give miners a choice, but he did. If miners are so "afraid", there are plenty of pools that openly support 2X, nothing stopping them from switching pools. Besides, slush didn't claim his pool was against 2X, just that only *some* of his pool supports 2X.
Edit: also, it's a bold claim that "what pays his bills" goes against his position when 92% of his miners either have no position, or are against 2X.  Not sure about you, but if I were slush I'd rather back the 92% who are being misrepresented rather than let someone else make claims  that may piss off the majority of my pool

I'd be more than happy to opt out of social security benefits if I could also opt out of the tax on it. I wouldn't even care about the money I've already put in. Unfortunately I don't have a choice, since the government is so bad at handling social security that they're paying it out with the money from the people paying in, since they've used the funds for other government spending. If that happened in the private sector,  I don't think it would be tolerated. But since it's the government, it's perfectly okay.
I don't have an issue with taxes, I have an issue with *income* taxes. They're unavoidable. They take it before I even touch it. I don't mind gas taxes, or sales tax, or property tax. At least I have *some* level of control over those.

I feel like some of the other responses didn't really answer your questions well.
I'm pro SegWit, and anti 2x. However, I realize that even with SegWit and level 2 scaling, Bitcoin can't survive forever without a blocksize increase. Sidechains reduce the transaction load, but they can't scale forever at the current blocksize. I disagree with 2X for several reasons.
 First, I think it's rushed. There hasn't been enough time for the ecosystem to prepare. A blocksize increase, and by association, a hard fork requires a *lot* of coordination. It needs way more testing. Then it needs time to allow the ecosystem to upgrade, and each piece of the ecosystem needs to do their own testing. Greg Maxwell had a great explanation about how 2X was not enough time compared to the time Core dedicates to even minor upgrades. I'll see if I can find it.
Second, an agreement to do a second scaling upgrade shortly after a previous one doesn't make sense. Let SegWit have time to be adopted, and then it can be evaluated to see how well it works. We need to take this one step at a time. There's nothing wrong with working on a blocksize increase while SegWit is given time to be adopted and evaluated, but the blocksize increase should be deployed when needed, not before there's proof. Bitcoin is a massive ecosystem with billions of dollars invested, let's be rational and careful about it's evolution.
Third, there are additional improvements that will allow for more transactions per block without just bumping the blocksize. Schnorr signatures and MAST will allow for much smaller multisig/P2SH transactions. This is a much better way to scale, improving efficiency rather than just bumping the blocksize. Also, I think Greg had a good explanation about how some efficiencies included in 0.14 (I think) allowed for the network to handle SegWits increased blocks, since it allows for blocks up to ~4MB.
Like I said, I don't have a problem with a blocksize increase, I feel like it will be inevitable if Bitcoin ever gains mass adoption, but hard forks need to be executed with a LOT of coordination, planning, and widespread support by the entire community. And if we do hard fork, let's be smart about it. When we do decide to increase blocks, it shouldn't be a one-off bump. It should be done in a way that slowly increases the blocksize over time. That way we don't have to keep needing more hard forks requiring the entire ecosystem to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:57:34
Well technically yes, because miners are free to choose to signal NYA, and given that his pool [publishes proof of the pool hashrate]( any miner can accurately verify that they aren't being cheated out of their payouts. I think that fits what you proposed.

Bitcoin Cash is a bit different, since it was intended to be a separate coin. Coinbase didn't need to do anything, since they just supported BTC. On top of that, when coinbase decided to credit users with BCH, they gave an extremely long time to implement it. They aren't adding support for BCH in GDAX or buy/sell, just a claim tool. And they said it should be ready by end of December.
A great example of issues caused by the short release timeframe for BCH is Trezor. They attempted to support it day one, but were plagued with tons of issues with their BCH bitcore nodes, and had to delay support.

I'd feel a lot better about a hard fork if it included more in it, and was safely tested. For reference, [here's a wishlist of changes that require a hard fork]( It'd be nice if we could at least clean up some technical debt. Instead we get a blocksize bump with no indication that it's needed, and virtually no testing.

I get the point you're trying to make about multiple implementations, but that's not without its own issues. Multiple implementations makes for increased chances of bugs. Instead of having all the developers working on a single codebase, and having people audit one codebase for bugs, they'd be split between each implementation.
