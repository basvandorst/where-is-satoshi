Awesome! I'm not sure exactly how accepting Bitpay or Bitstamp works on the receiver's end, but I think they may convert it directly into fiat for you. Something like that would probably be the best option - I can't imagine most animal shelters have the time or resources to be constantly arranging localbitcoins trades for cash lol

what's it to you, officer?

It's not elitism. The vast majority of my income is in bitcoins, so naturally that's what I'm going to use to donate.

Yeah, anywhere is fine by me as long as the money will be put to good use! I'm thinking roughly $500/month in small increments, but I can't make any guarantees as I don't know how my cash flow will look later down the road.
