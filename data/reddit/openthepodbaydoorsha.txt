JPM is a criminal organization, plain and simple. That's not an opinion, that's a fact. And I don't mean inadvertently, or in one rogue department, or in a way senior managers did not know about. Here is the recent list of FINES PAID. In our system of giving banks everything they want, including our taxpayer bailout money, you have to try pretty hard to get criminal fines like these:
Jan. 8 $1,7 billion - US Gov't
Jan. 7 $350 million - Office of Comptroller of the Currency
Jan. 7 $461 million - US Treasury Department FinCEN
Oct. 16 $100 million - CFTC
Sept. 19 $200 million - SEC
Sept. 18 $200 million - Federal Reserve
Sept. 18 $221 million - UK FCA
Sept 17 $300 million - OCC
Sept. 18 $309 million - CFPB

Wait until you learn what "street name" means. OK, I'll tell you. When you "own" a stock at a brokerage, there's a good chance yo don't "own" it at all. You may have believed you have 100 shares of Google with your name on them, and the brokerage is just holding them for you. Unh-uh. You have a claim against the balance sheet of the brokerage in the amount of the value of those shares. The brokerage owns them; and lends them to others as collateral (called securities lending) and earns a fee. If the stuff hits the fan (again) then you will be in line behind many others, waiting for "your" money. Ask the people who had warehouse receipts for gold, held by MF Global. They got 78 cents on the dollar.

When their banks fail they take the money from us by making sure bank interest rates are so low that savers can't save any more. When they want to steal and money launder, they buy politicians so they don't have to go to jail. They know that if the people's money ever gets a chance to flourish they are screwed, so they scream about money laundering and put extra laws in place for Bitcoin but  they launder $1 trillion per year through the biggest banks in the world and nobody bats an eye or goes to jail.

I think dogecoins teaches an important lesson. Previously people used money because it was available, they knew how much it was worth, and they trusted it. Doge adds another dimension: money you use because of *affinity*. You identify with the community that the money represents. Bitcoin has quite alot of that effect too, but that's really all that Doge has.
So if there are lots of monies available (on the net); and they're established enough so I trust them; and they're traded enough so I know how much they're worth; why not pick the one I identify with? PepsiCoin, or MileyCoin or SeaShepherdCoin.

sure...like confetti. Did it ever occur to you the absurdity of that claim? That something issued in an *infinite* quantity could ever hold any lasting value? For something to have value it must be SCARCE, not INFINITE. Eventually people always move to a store of value that is scarce, not abundant beyond belief. Just because right now ALL fiat regimes are failing equally does not mean a new SCARCE source of value cannot appear. Economists talk about the dollar being "the cleanest dirty shirt", as if the best we can hope for is a dirty shirt, but just less dirty than all of the others. The sheer historical myopia of the crowd that says "oh oh no problem the Fed can just print in unlimited (to use Draghi's term) quantities and there will be no consequences...may I suggest a book for you?

I went to Europe recently. Are you saying that I now need to determine the USD price of the euros I spent, at the precise time I spent them, and declare a cap gain (or loss)? No, that's not how it works. There is an exemption for personal transactions. Bitcoin should be the same. Global commerce would grind to a halt if personal transactions like this each triggered a cap gain/loss. You think US tourists visiting the Caribbean need to note the USD price of each of the currencies they spend along the way, at the precise time of purchase? They bought an umbrella drink in the Bahamas, now they need to mark down the precise USD exchange rate for Bahamian dollars at 4:22PM on Thursday March 27, calculate the cap gain (or loss), and submit a 1099? No, doesn't work that way. Sorry, the IRS got it completely wrong.

Depending on which state you are in because that will determine the sales tax due on the Bitcoin you bought goods with. The merchant will need to ask you at the register which state the Bitcoin you are using were purchased in. Then, when he knows the Bitcoin you are purchasing are originally from South Dakota, his cash register can automatically tell you the sales tax due on your purchase (merchant will be liable if he doesn't calculate and remit this properly). Maybe some advanced merchants will allow you to use Bitcoins from multiple different state origins for a purchase, and calculate the blended, weighted state tax due for each particular purchase. Of course some states will have different sales tax treatment of Bitcoins mined in that state compared to Bitcoins just sold in that state, and so must adjust for that as well.

Andreas leads the way again. He makes the simple point that Apple, Visa etc based on current money and banking systems are all "pull" model. Bitcoin is "push". With a Visa/Apple card, first you store some secret number (CC number) online. If somebody takes this number (see: Target) then you're screwed. The number not only authorizes your one transaction and transaction size, it authorizes as many future transactions that the thief wants. Bitcoin however "pushes" only the amount required for only that one transaction without having to store your entire financial identity anywhere.

Here's the message I just tried to send them. Email failed.
You guys need to change the tone. You are trashing big banks and touting Bitcoin as a way to "fight back" against them. This is stupid and will not work. You state that you want to "align the interests of politicians and the Bitcoin community". But politicians want to get re-elected, that's all. Look at Obama's largest campaign contributors: Goldman Sachs is  
So a better approach would be to drop the bank bashing completely. NO mention of banks is even required. You should remove your petition and rewrite it. It should talk about innovation, and jobs, and the fact that other countries (Germany, Denmark, Hong Kong, Singapore) are taking the lead in this new industry, and the fact that the patchwork of 50 states regs holds the US back. Jobs, innovation, the future...NOT bashing banks. Otherwise you will fail.

At current mining rates and Bitcoin price ($650), Bitcoin needs +/- $2.3 million per day in new fiat money coming in to maintain the current price. Major exchange closing down doesn't help out this new flow. Countries declaring it illegal doesn't help. Regulators and money laundering arrests. Merchant uptake is too slow to assist with this flow.
Price rise late last year were too much too fast. Price needs to settle back to $150-$250 range IMO

Sorry that is not correct. Arbitrage is buying the same product in different markets at the same time and profiting from any small price differential. Investors purchasing foreign currency by contrast are doing so because they believe it will appreciate in value (relative to another currency, usually their home currency). Not the same product, two different products. That is NOT arbitrage.
I assure you this has absolutely nothing to do with your local bank. Volumes are approximately $3.9 trillion per day.

The amount of new gold discovered each year is approx 2% of the total supply. That's also the number Milton Friedman suggested when he said we should replace the Fed with a laptop that increased the money supply at that rate. I'd concede that could counteract the deflationary effects you describe. What emphatically does NOT work is what we have today, where we get politically-dependent central bankers inflating currency supplies to satisfy endlessly expanding government spending. Each time the promises made backed by fiat exceed the economy's ability to deliver and we get serial bubble/pop syndrome that takes EVERY fiat regime down.

None of this matters one bit. America's capital markets are meant to be a place for enterprises to raise money for business activities. On top of that are viable businesses that make that creation and flow of capital operate efficiently. HFT adds to neither. Markets were never intended to be a casino or a video game. Capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income because it is felt that the capital formation process is valuable. This is not. There should be a minimum 1 second persistence rule for all stock quotes and a minimum 1 hour holding period.

oh please yes of course the Fed sells bills and bonds in return for currency being created. The salient point is whether they are in the business of creating credit or not. Since the US spends +/- $1 *trillion* more than it takes in, the answer is YES. Just like the Japanese...who now comprise 28% of the *buyers* of the debt they issue themselves, uh-huh that's gonna work out well. The entire subject of "sound" money is stuck in an echo chamber based on a complete fallacy. Fiat-istas say that OMG deflation is bad, sounds bad, must be bad. In a fiat money system, deflation IS bad because the only condition where a fiat money system can deflate is when there is a complete collapse in demand. They can print in your famous unlimited quantities...so people going on a purchaser's strike is reasonably viewed as catastrophic. But in a non-fiat system, where holders of the currency know that supply is constant, deflation is not a catastrophe at all.

People need to get educated. Yes, you may have sent your $ to an exchange. And you "bought" some Bitcoin. But you might be amazed to learn that those Bitcoin do not necessarily appear in the blockchain. Why? Because the exchange has not bought them. What you own is an entry on the exchange's ledger, NOT necessarily a Bitcoin registered in a blockchain. 
Even when your purchase is "confirmed" by an exchange, what does that mean? Ever notice how some exchanges "confirm" immediately? They are using an algorithm that tells them the approximate probability that a Bitcoin transfer WILL confirm in the blockchain. An exchange that "pre-funds" by contrast, at a minimum always HAS the product that you bought in their inventory.
This is not much different from the world of stocks and bonds. When you buy a stock at a brokerage like Charles Schwab, they are held in something called "street name". Your statement says you "own" 100 shares of IBM, but actually you own a claim on the ledger of Charles Schwab. Schwab owes you those 100 shares. You can ask not to hold your stocks in street name but brokerages don't like it, because they want the freedom to lend your stock to others as collateral and receive a small fee for doing that. That's called "securities lending". Read the fine print of your brokerage contract. Or your mutual fund contract for that matter.
While we're at it, what do you own when you have a bank account? Actually you have given your money to the bank, and the bank owes it to you. They don't have an account with your name on it with the money in it. You have become a "general unsecured creditor" of the bank. If they gamble away their money on derivatives, those creditors will be well ahead of you in line when it comes time to get "your" money. Bank bondholders will also be ahead of you. That's what happened in 2008: and the Wizard of Ben stepped in, waved a magic wand, and said "oh look over here, I can create enough money with the click of a mouse so these nice people don't have to worry that their bank is bust". So long as people believe in the Wizard (and his counterparts in Japan, Europe, and China) then all is well. When the tide goes out again we'll see who's not wearing a bathing suit.
When doing business with a Bitcoin exchange, you are, at least temporarily, taking the credit of that exchange provider. If/when they buy your coins, and they can be freely transferred, then you can remove that credit risk by immediately transferring them to an address controlled by yourself. This is why the Gox situation is so screwed: nobody can tell what they have, where, in what state of transfer, to whom, and what Gox owes to customers and others.

Governments want inflation because it lets them borrow more and expand without the populace noticing. They do that by reducing the value of the currency their debt is denominated in so they can borrow more (this is a form of stealth taxation but raising real taxes would be far more noticeable). Bankers want inflation for the very same reason. Used car salesmen sell cars, bankers sell debt. Why would people ever want inflation however? Why would we want our money to lose purchasing power? Why would you want to go to the store and receive less of something than you could get before?
So they have constructed a giant media echo chamber to tell us that oh oh SOME inflation is a good thing. It's not. Especially if wages do not inflate at least as much as prices. That would be what is called A DECLINING STANDARD OF LIVING. Why would we want that?
It all depends if you think money is wealth. If so, then inflate away, we'll all be billionaires. But if you think goods and services are wealth, and money is a way to represent and transact in that real wealth, then multiplying the number of units of money to represent the same quantity of REAL wealth only means...that each unit of money represents less wealth than before.
This stuff is not that hard, folks.

But they're stupid rules. If I buy a euro in my brokerage account, it goes up, and I sell it, I owe cap gains tax. But if I buy a euro, get on a plane, fly to Rome, and a few days later spend the euro on a coffee...the IRS DOES NOT require me to calculate the USD value of the euro at the precise instant I bought the coffee, and pay a cap gain. Bitcoin should be no different: an exemption for personal transactions.

Dude, try decaf, really. Credit cards are "pull" payments, you must reveal your secret number to the waiter or the store clerk or the website, a number that allows unlimited future transactions on your account. Your money is locked to your identity which they must "verify" somehow and then pull the amount from your account. "They" happen to need tens of billions in fraud checks to do it this way, and still their fraud rates are rising like mad. So "they" charge high fees, "they" don't pay any interest on bank accounts, and "they" come crying to the taxpayer for tens of billions in bailouts when they lose money.
A "push" payment like Bitcoin let's me specify precisely how much I want to spend for one transaction only, and that precise amount only is pushed to the recipient in a one-time transaction. There is no need for anyone in the chain to know who I am, where my account is, or how much I have in it. It's a self-contained unit of value that can travel anywhere I want it to with no worries about getting my account drained (so long as you protect your e-money).
I hope this explanation helps. The other thing people don't get is that this is not an "either/or" situation. Credit cards will thrive alongside crypto, in different markets for different reasons.

Infinite was your word, not mine. How'd you do with the rest of my points? You think it's perfectly normal that almost six years after their latest bubble popping, interest rates should still be at zero point zero? Pretty shaky system if you ask me if the only way to keep it going is to pretend money is free and risk no longer exists. Ever wonder why? Do you think it might be because way too much credit is being extended in the banking system? Starting with the central guarantor? Ever wonder what would have happened if instead of handing the tsunami of printed money to banks, the Fed had handed it to actual people? At their current rate that would equal $921.00 PER MONTH for a family of four. We would be in the midst of an economic boom of unreal proportions had they done that.

"Market Capitalization" refers to a company, it's a measure of the value of their shares times the number of shares outstanding, which gives the total value of the company. Bitcoin is not a company, it's much more like a currency. With a currency, the value of all of the outstanding currency is called the "float".

And how about all of the VCs putting money into this space, you'd think they would see the need to have a few more core devs than 1 full-time guy and about 8 part-timers. And then there are the "coin taint" crowd that fell over themselves to suggest ways regulators could taint Bitcoin out of existence. And let's not even get started about Karpeles.

Banks want people to think inflation is a good thing because guess what? They can sell more debt that way. It's like used car salesmen want to do one thing: sell cars. Bankers sell debt.
Prices going DOWN as technology and productivity goes up is known by another name: PROGRESS.
Question: have you bought a computer recently? Why didn't you just "hoard" and wait to get twice the features at the same cost? 
America's highest wealth growth came during eras of *deflation*, when guess what, the money you have can buy MORE GOODS AND SERVICES.
If you think money = wealth then sure, why not print a giant pile of money for everybody? I happen to think GOODS &amp; SERVICES = WEALTH, and money just *represents* those things. Printing more money (inflating the currency) to represent the same quantity of goods and services just means that each unit of money...(drumroll)...REPRESENTS LESS GOODS AND SERVICES.

OMG can everybody all at once just jump back on this side of the couch? Do you declare a capital gain to the IRS when you find a quarter on the ground?

If not, make a "best efforts" estimate at the end of the year on your capital gains and be done with it. There is no separate 1099 requirement for each Bitcoin transaction.

LOL pretty well-accepted uh-huh by the same people who brought you the wonderful economic state of affairs we're in.
I'll ask the same question: do you think money = wealth? If so, then inflate away! Give everybody a giant pile of money and we'll all be billionaires. I happen to think goods and services = wealth, and money is used to *represent* those goods and services. If you print a bunch of money, it just means that each unit of money represents a smaller quantity of goods and services. You haven't increased wealth, you've reduced the amount of wealth represented by each unit of money.
Agriculture, technology, manufacturing, all are getting more efficient. If the amount of money stayed relatively stable, guess what? We would be wealthier. We would have more computer for the same amount of money. We would have more food for the same amount of money. Our standard of living would be HIGHER. That's called PROGRESS.

Wow. Can we all just review the facts? 1. China imposes severe controls on its currency, it cannot be bought &amp; sold on open markets by just anybody. They want to stem the flow of wealth overseas; 2. China saw that people were buying XBT and effectively using that avenue to export wealth so they shut down RMB transfers into XBT; 3. they said XBT may not be used for physical goods in China (like they did for QCoin in 2009, which had hundreds of millions of users and is now like Linden Dollars); 4. these cute little voucher schemes to get RMB into XBT exchanges clearly violate the spirit of the regs and will soon be shut down; 5. Li Ka-Sheng is based in Hong Kong, not China. It's likely China will allow HK to operate freely as they do with other financial markets; but XBT in the PRC (except as funny money) is dead.

I respectfully disagree and no, am not trolling. I think you've answered your own question: the person that has attached value to a Bitcoin did not have to say "why" they attach value to it. Yes it may be because they feel it is useful to purchase things. And yes, they may attach value to it solely because they know other people attach value to it. What can be bought, for example, with gold? It's use and demand in industry would imply a value around $150. It's trading right now around $1250.

IMO there's a short term and a long term answer to the question. But before that you need to decide something binary: will it be worth zero, or will it be worth something. I believe it will be worth something. In the short run the price seems connected to news headlines, mining hashrate (supply), and "friction". By friction I mean how crappy the exchanges are, how complicated it all seems to n00bs, how bad the wallets are (Armory comes to mind). I think that friction will decline rapidly (lots of dev &amp; money coming in to fix stuff). In the long run it's obvious the currencies the BTC price are measured against are debasing rapidly. The Japanese (Banzai!) will DOUBLE the amount of yen in the next 16 months. USD and Euro similar stories.

The government just wants to know who you are, how much you have, where you got the money, and are you paying your taxes. They don't care what currency you hold and cannot and will not make holding a currency illegal. Imagine saying it is illegal for Americans to buy Euros? For starters this would be bad for Europe, and 9 of the 16 owners of the Fed are European. Never happen. Argentina made it illegal for citizens to own USD but all world trade would stop if the US said its citizens (and companies) could not own other currencies.

Revoking US is simple but you need to do your homework. There is "renouncing" but there are other forms as well. They want you to come in to the US Embassy and explain your reasons; and they don't want to hear "it's to avoid tax". After that it was simple. I even hear that you can later say you made a mistake and can get it back.
Getting AUS citizenship takes a while unless you have alot of money: every nation including the US allows you to buy citizenship. I heard in Spain you just need to invest $250K (buy a house etc) and an EU passport allows you to live in 22 countries. Without an investment, it takes 5 years to get an AUS passport, the way to do it is to get a 457 work visa.

I think it's pretty simple. Bankers are like car salesmen, they just want to move more product (debt is what they sell). Once they've loaded everybody and everything up with debt (like now, governments, student loans, stock margin loans, mortgages, credit card receivables etc.) then the only way to issue more debt (and earn fat commissions) is to "inflate away" that stock of existing debt that is outstanding (make the money worth less so the debt repayment gets smaller). So Mr. Head Banker, in our case The Wizard of Ben, must do everything he can to cause inflation. Best way of course is to print lots and lots of money.
Deflation, by contrast, might also be called "Progress". Things become cheaper as productivity rises. Nobody minds when computers become cheaper, for example, or agriculture becomes more efficient.
Instead we are stuck in a system controlled by bankers who just want to issue more debt.
The US has had some long periods of deflation, when we operated under something called "capitalism". Those periods were some of the highest growth and true wealth creation periods in our history.
So don't get stuck in the "oooh deflation is bad, so bad" myth that infuses the debate today. It's promulgated by failed bankers with failed economic theories who happen to have a stranglehold right now on world governments &amp; people. Bitcoin = The People's Money.

Gold is broken, probably permanently. It has become a "financialized" asset. The price is controlled in the futures, options and ETF market, not based on physical demand. With the regulators bought and paid for, with financial crimes no longer prosecuted, and with regulators asleep at the switch anyway, it's very unlikely that sad situation will change anytime soon. Physical demand can continue to skyrocket but the people controlling the price can always play more re-hypothecation and fake collateral games. The Bundesbank asked for their gold back from the Fed: the official answer was 1. No they would not be allowed to see the numbered bars supposedly held on their behalf, and 2. Yes they could have their gold back, but only over 7 years. It's done, put a fork in it.

BTC is very heavily owned right now by VERY few individuals who own LOTS. That's a real threat to the maintenance of the price. It can't rise much until two things happen: greater demand due to merchant adoption (a very slow process) and greater use by a wider group of speculators. The second factor is much more important: currently 98% of fiat foreign exchange transactions are by speculators, with just 2% to settle purchases and cross-border transactions. The third factor has to do with plain old usability. I mean can someone send me to a safe cloud wallet with a smartphone app that actually works ? (and pls don't tell me Armory or blockchain.info both of which have blown up for me, I barely got my Armory coins out and blockchain is nothing but error messages for me despite numerous re-installs and general hacking).
I'm bullish but I think the price will hit $50 before it hits $150 (on it's way to $500+).

We started by looking at a map of the world. We wanted an English-speaking country so that narrowed it enormously, we could also have also selected a country with a relatively easy language (Spanish for example) but easiest is English, especially when you consider employment options. We wanted a country with good education; good healthcare; good economy; and a sense of social justice (for things like minimum wage, personal privacy etc.). There are always trade-offs. We selected Australia. National minimum wage is $17; employers are required to put 10% of your salary in an investment account that you control and invest; healthcare is excellent and about 1/3 the cot of the US; and sending my two boys to university will cost me about $1500 per year. They have real banking regulations in place so the country has sailed right through the Global Financial Crisis. On the minus side, "stuff" (dishwashers etc) is very expensive here but once you figure things out ("hey my uncle has a warehouse outside of town that sells those for 1/3 off") it's manageable. The people are incredibly friendly and are one of the few countries left in the world that likes Americans; they remember how the US saved them in WWII. Fitting in socially is simple and there are people from all over the world. The lifestyle and business culture are very relaxed; people work hard but the vacation time is epic. In summer it's like France in August; I mean everyone is gone from Dec. 15 to January 15, time to hit the beach and no I will not be checking email. Did I mention the best beaches in the world? We've traveled all over, Brazil, Spain, SE Asia, Mexico and this country has the very best.
They have a visa program called 457 visa that is for 5 years; you need to work here for five years and can then apply for citizenship. Employers will sponsor you for the visa but there is somewhat of a chicken/egg (hard to find a job without visa; hard to get the visa without a job). There's a long list of skills that get you a fast-track 457 visa. I dropped my US passport so would no longer have to pay Uncle Sam taxes (I got tired of my dollars going to drone bomb the arms off of five-year olds, sorry). They don't double tax you but I am so glad not to have to figure out the ridiculous US tax forms, filing here is a dream. In general they have their stuff together as a country. An example is when they instituted the cervical cancer vaccine. Science said all girls over 16 should have access to the vaccine; they debated it for about three weeks; passed the law; and the program to fund it for every girl in the nation rolled out about 3 weeks later.
Also on the minus side, it's very far away. But many of our parents generation did the same thing, emigrated for a better life.
Other countries I would think about would be the Scandy countries; Germany; Chile; Ecuador; Singapore. Getting a passport for one of these countries could be the most important thing you do for your children and grandchildren.

People don't understand how currency trading works. 98% of currency trades are for speculation, not to settle transactions (purchases in a foreign currency). So yes, Bitcoin acceptance by merchants is very important...but not nearly as important as people think.

Nice way to finish our friendly debate. Don't get me wrong, I am in love with the things that Bitcoin can do. I just think people can assign value to anything, like gobs of oil pant on three pieces of canvas:

1. Completely agree. It's VERY thinly-traded. That will change over time. Meantime take advantage, today was a trader's dream.
2. Yes there is: it's called gold. Nature is not making any more of it (not on Earth, anyway). And guess what, it's really valuable. Funny you should mention a $1 billion Bitcoin, just when some very serious economists are proposing the US Treasury mint a *$1 trillion* platinum coin.
3. Yes many rules are not present, but they are on the way. Entrepreneurs will help that happen. And yes there is short selling, margin trading, CFDs, options, &amp; futures, suggest GOOG search.. And yes some people are working on fractional reserve Bitcoins (so they can pay interest.)
4. Yes it is wild. Compared to "regular" financial markets, where central banks have squashed all of the vol out, and HFT machines have squeezed all of the inefficiencies out (20,000 trades per second), not to mention blatant front-running, tape painting, insider trading, banging the close, dark pools, off-balance sheet accounting, and dozens of other games Wall Street gets up to with regulators asleep at the switch (with the gov't closed they're not even *at* their posts). Our lovely largest bank paid *1/3 of their income* in the last three years in fines and legal for law breaking. Oh you mean THAT "real world"?

It's a myth that transactions by merchants are what will drive BTC price. In the fiat money world, 98% of foreign exchange trades are for speculative purposes, not trade. It's the speculators that will drive the BTC price. IMO right now there are quite a few factors at play. The price is deeply affected by the news cycle and the news has not been positive (Mt. Gox, etc.). Adoption is a very slow slog: I mean can anyone yet recommend to me a usable Android wallet? Armory froze up on me, blockchain.info never settles transactions. How are we supposed to get adoption if even tech-savvy people are having these kinds of problems?
I'm looking to see whether we settle above the longer-term trendline: +/=50 after the big runup, then 80 or so, then 85 or so. If we can hold $88 then we may have a slow drift upwards. But if we don't hold $88 then watch out below. And it's still very clunky to short BTC, alas.

I think alot of Americans are afflicted with an insidious disease since the War on Terra began. It's called Guilty Until Proven Innocent Syndrome. NSA says "we're looking for a needle in a haystack so just give us the whole haystack and we'll sift out the needles". Purchased politicians and a supine population go along. C'mon, ransomware has been around a long time and they don't talk about banning the US Dollar. There's one currency in the world that stands head and shoulders above all others for illegal activity: USD. Why not ban it first and foremost? The channel by which the great majority of child porn is distributed should be declared illegal: oops it's that series of tubes known as the internets.

This post is not right. 98% of fiat currency transactions are for speculation, not to settle international purchases or debts. Bitcoin needs more speculators. Right now a very large percentage of the Bitcoins in circulation are held by a very small number of individuals. The "dark pool" exchanges (TradeHill etc.) merely have the email addresses of some of these large holders. So the price is subject to the whim of very few people. Not a good situation.

Hate to tell you but the dollar IS failing around us. Look at the price of energy, health care, education, gas, stocks, etc etc over the last 10 years. If we had sound money the price of these would be the same, or even lower, since people, industry, agriculture get more productive. We would all have a higher standard of living. Instead we have a criminal cartel that makes our money and all they want to do is prop up their insolvent constituents (banks). These people do NOT work for you and me.

The reaction by BTC China, and most of the reddit commentary, shows a lack of understanding of the government's view of Bitcoin. The yuan is not a free floating currency and there are severe restrictions on it. These moves by the PBOC are to ensure that there are no "side channels" where wealth can leak out of China. So no matter what, there will not be some kind of "compromise" whereby PRC citizens can deposit RMB into mainland Bitcoin brokerages, end of story. The PBOC are merely doing the same thing they did to TenCent's QQ Coin in 2009...and that had *hundreds* of millions of users. Bitcoin will have to get along without mainland China, simple as that.

Fantastic post. Ever since the Bundesbank asked the Fed for their gold back they've been stomping on the gold price (more than normal). Another theory says that everybody knows there's a global "reset" coming and the Chinese do not yet have a representative amount of chips at the poker table (just like the French and the British were helped to build up their pile after WWII) so the West is actively helping the Chinese accumulate at low prices. Bitcoin may have thrown all of that out the window. I do not believe that somehow they will support gold in the face of the e-currency crisis. I think they'll be more like Eastman Kodak: they had all the patents for digital photography but their existing franchise selling film was such a cash cow that they just milked it until the cow died.

You bring some interesting points but I don't think people are thinking of the very big picture here.
1. Governance needs to be spread much more widely than 5 core devs and the 5 biggest mining pools;
2. The US is a lousy place to have all of the power in the Foundation given the regulatory McCarthyism going on in the US. The Chinese are fast becoming the biggest users and I'll bet they are completely unaware this debate and this possibility even exists.
3. The charter of the Foundation needs to be: to maintain the integrity of Bitcoin. Anything that could cause a major fork should be viewed as an existential threat. This certainly could.

Bitcoin is software. As soon as software comes out it is obsolete, with "two guys in a garage" making something better. Honest people will acknowledge that Bitcoin has serious flaws, and an altcoin will come along that addresses those flaws. The problem is that the barriers to entry are very small, anyone can make a fork or a new protocol. Getting adoption takes time and Bitcoin has "first mover advantage", but let's be honest about Bitcoin's first mover: +/- 10 million people own it worldwide and +/- 25,000 merchants use it. Visa signs up 2,000 merchants PER DAY. My point is that Bitcoin's first mover advantage is tiny, and with almost no barrier for a superior system to emerge it's bound to happen sooner or later. And with a proliferation of altcoins, the "limited supply" advantage of altcoins goes away too.
I own and love Bitcoin but I'll be keeping a close eye on the altcoin space.

What Bernanke "didn't say" is that he is the High Priest of an economic religion that has utterly failed its mission. The Earth is the center of the universe for all of these priests. We naturally know that colluding to fix prices in a monopoly is BAD and we do not permit it in any industry. Oh except in the most important industry of all, the one that manufactures our money. We are taught to believe that inflation is somehow good; but as Jim Grant points out, some of America's fastest growth rates in productivity and REAL wealth creation came during periods of *deflation*. You know, like when people and industry and agriculture get more productive and prices FALL. We all think it's great when you get more computer for the same amount of money; it's called PROGRESS.
