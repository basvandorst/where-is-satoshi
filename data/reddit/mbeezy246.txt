In my opinion this is massive, and I'm surprised there hasn't been more discussion on it.
I don't think CME will abandon, they're doing this to make money not through any altruistic reasons. They make money ever time someone trades 1 contract (5 BTC).
My first thought was that this can only be positive for price. There is a lot of institutional money out there that until now has not had much legitimate means of of owning bitcoin. I'm not talking about day-traders who will trade short term and provide liquidity, but Portfolio Managers etc. who can't not own a bit of something that has gone up so much percentage-wise each year. I think we'll grind higher as the listing approaches and then see a period of pretty steep advance. 
 
My second thought was that this is a massive conspiracy; the powers that be come in and smash bitcoin to the floor, everyone bails, crypto reputation is destroyed, then they can rest easy for a few more years.

Fed pumped tens of billions of dollars a month into the economy during QE, 85bn a month for over a year in QE3.  Who do you think crypto is threatening?
I don't actually think this is what's going on (conspiracy theory in my first post), and it wouldn't necessarily be the fed, but I think you're slightly over-estimating retail 'buy the dippers'.

OP, is part of validation concerned with proving stored wine is kept in proper conditions e.g temperature/humidity? If so check out modum.

Futures will affect spot because if one differs massively in price to another you could simultaneously buy the lower and sell the higher and lock in a profit (arbitrage).

I don't know but there are a few quantum resistant cryptos out there e.g. iota.

My point was there's plenty of people with lots of money who don't want bitcoin to succeed, and this could just be part of a plan to hurt crypto.

If there are more sellers than buyers at a particular level then price goes down, this is how it moves. By your logic it would never change.

I think you're underestimating the scale.
