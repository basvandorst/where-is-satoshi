- I'm in the same position: made 2 deposits after the theft which were never credited to my account (and weren't stolen).
I opened a ticket yesterday and the response I received (a few hours ago) leads me to believe that deposits made after the hack won't be treated the same as those made before the hack.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:23:14


And they blocked withdrawals for the same period!
I'm actually ok with socialising the losses with the assets they had at the time of the theft (I don't like it obviously, but I don't see that they have a choice).  But using funds obtained after the theft is theft in itself.  
I can only assume that they'll be trying to avoid lawsuits to this effect though - so hopefully they won't try to do this.

Hi Zane,
What's the plan for withdrawals which were in process at the time of the hack.  I'll have to check the exact timelines, but I believe I had quite a few which were confirmed/approved etc at the time of the hack (i.e. they didn't show in my balance, but had not appeared on the blockchain).
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:04:27


I'd question whether you can do this legally.
If I were to send you 100btc right now, I don't think you'd be within your rights to keep it.
(but IANAL etc.)

Why doesn't core use segwit *change* addresses for segwit txes?
Or is there something I need to do to turn that on?

I'm not entirely sure that's true (at least in China, where much of the hashpower is).

I'm pretty sure that their wallet address is public knowledge.
Gimme a sec and I'll find it - I've defo seen it posted here before....
Edit: nope, can't find it.
I'm pretty sure I saw it somewhere in their AMA:  but that thread is just nuts long now and full of crap.
(iirc it was just some random comment which linked to the address and asked them to comment on it.  tx'es, dates, and amounts on the address matched up pretty much verbatim with what they should do)

The ironic thing here is that the actual purchase with the bitcoin (buying the taco) was painless - comparable to a credit card payment.  The screwed-up stuff was converting to/from fiat.
And of course this would be simpler pretty much anywhere else in the world (the KYC crap being perdominantly a US thing).

Great thread - elephant(s) in the room and so on.
I think the biggest flaw is screamingly obvious on this sub - **theft**.  *The reality is that, for the average person, they simply cannot safely own a wallet unless it's completely offline.*
Until someone comes up with a solution to this (e.g. something like a trezor in credit card shape), I can't see the user base expanding much beyond where it is currently.
Other issues like confirmation times, block size limits and so on are very insignificant by comparison.  imho at least.

Opened a ticket (unrelated to this) with them last night - they responded and resolved in under an hour.  No other exchange even comes close to that.
And their api always works.  Again, no one else is even close on that front.

Appears that lots of transactions are showing a 'unconfirmed' when they have many (&gt;50) actual confirmations on the blockchain, e.g.
 (0 confirmations)
 (52 confirmations)
 (0 confirmations)
 (52 confirmations)
 (0 confirmations)
 (64 confirmations)
 (0 confirmations)
 (66 confirmations)

I wonder would it be better to support [openwrt]( instead?
dd-wrt is a highly commercialised project, and chunks of it are not (I believe) even released as source.  openwrt is more in the spirit of open source, and probably needs the support more.
(just my 2c, not trying to start a war)
Edit: just noticed that you mentioned openwrt also.  So we're on the same page I guess.  I'd be inclined to *just* support the open source forks though, and dd-wrt can leverage their source if they wish.
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:58:36
to where?
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:26:38
That's not how it would work though - if he were to broadcast a tx for his coins after the supposed fork (which would all pre-date the fork) it would be picked up by both chains.  I don't see that that would be expressing any kind of preference?

Not sure if it was posted here or I saw it elsewhere, but my understanding is that they were forced for a time to stop using the hot wallet (which would of course mean disabling withdrawals)
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:46:05
I've no idea (but agreed, it sounds kinda high!)
Edit: wow, yes, that's the amount, give or take: 231,849 BTC in cold wallets. [source](
@_date: 2015-05-28 12:33:05
As someone mentioned below, from the block numbers you're mentioning, this must have happened 10-11**am**, not pm.  Was that a typo, or are your block numbers off?
Also, I'd question whether this had any noticeable effect on the blockchain.  This is a graph of transactions waiting at that time (based on your block numbers, not time):
The red line is block 357689, when you stopped.  (I'm 3hrs off UTC, hence the time difference)
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:15:32
There's a very positive aspect to this however (whatever your view on the block size): **he's moving ahead, yes, but he's not doing so in bitcoin-core**.  (as lead-dev I expect he would have the power to do that without consensus if he elected to).
I think that's to be commended, whatever your opinion on the changes being made.
This is in going back to the fundamentals of bitcoin: longest chain wins.
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:37:33
Has someone actually confirmed that that's the hacker's wallet?
I understand that bitfinex are reporting 1301btc stolen - which doesn't match with the amount there.
(it could be that that's a bitfinex wallet - both they and the hacker were scraping the same source for a time, essentially trying to catch the deposits as they were confirmed)
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:32:08
Withdrawals are being enabled again, so people with USD are buying BTC to get it out of there.
@_date: 2015-05-29 14:43:55
I'm with him.
I've always been concerned that core devs would abuse their power (by committing something to bitcoin-core without consensus), but it sounds now like he's proposing a (software) fork instead of this.  This is exactly how OSS should work I believe.

On the lower chart you mean?  The spike before midnight (GMT-3) on the 2**3**rd?  
I don't actually know what "blockInvReceived" measures, so can't help you there.
(graph of transactions waiting is the top graph, I just included the lower one b/c it has block numbers)

I guess he could send bitcoins from the chain he likes to one of his addresses, and then move them :S
But in reality, if he were trying to vote, signing a message to that effect would be much better!
(so many throwaway accounts in use today, by people who obviously know what they're talking about, i.e. not me: his voice would be well lost in the chatter!)
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:13:59
Appreciate the effort, but there are several inaccuracies here, and even where accurate, it's obviously highly biased.
The idea is solid though.  Get a *lot* of people together and have them vote under these categories - it would give you a much better result.
tl;dr: the data sucks, but the idea is solid.

Thanks Zane - no money for me then :'(
(I sold all my bfx within minutes of receiving them, for around 20 cents on the dollar - I honestly didn't think that bitfinex would survive more than a few days!)
... back to one-on-one negotiations with the hacker then, seems it's the only way I'm going to get back my money :)
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:27:46
It was very messy the way they implemented it, so it's not as simple as that.  Even though the theft was only btc, they haircut all customer assets.  So you can't really say "today's price", without taking into account the relative proportion of the assets the customer had at the time.
Really, I think the only viable option would be to return what they recover in btc, i.e. if they get back 10% of the coins lost, distribute it pro rata in btc across the board (relative to haircut amounts, using the exchange rates they used at the time of the haircut)
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:08:48
Presumably this will lead to some of the coins being recovered.
It'll be nice to get some of our money back, even if it's only a small amount.

Sounds similar to the reaction I got when I suggested we get an email address in the early 90's (93 I think).

+1 on this.
Yes, using the wildcard syntax was silly.  But I don't see any reason for removing support for it.
