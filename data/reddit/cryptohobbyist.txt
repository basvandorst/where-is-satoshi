Brilliant insight, I want to write an article on this. Please share more or links if possible to research further 
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:04:55
I think that’s inevitable 
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:08:41
Interesting observation 
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:09:14
Didn’t think of that scenario, interesting 
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:30:15
Great, thanks for this link. I will check it out 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:27:56
People get emotionally attached to all the hype and battle to see future values like me at the moment 
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:28:12
I have researched plenty and yes it can be both regulated and taxed depending on nation. If you do research on economic systems and government ability to control you see how this is possible. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:24:35
Good point... didn’t think of that 
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:31:57
Quantitative easing ... bad news for any economy 
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:25:51
I like the view you shared.. different 
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:28:55
Thanks for this useful link! I will study this further 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:44:04
:) now we’re pushing it 
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:07:06
I have never heard of this before ...
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:31:37
I think it’s a given certainty it will happen in time 
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:04:03
My thoughts are similar 
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:41:58
I battle to see it, perhaps from a lack of supply but remember you can splice a bitcoin into 10 000 000 units ... perhaps but it seems like a reach. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:29:42
I think speculation trumps inevitability 
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:05:30
Didn’t think of that but how does he himself make money from the blockchain and crypto?
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:44:48
Regulation will allow more confidence in the world and allow for a greater uptake of these technologies ... I think it’s needed
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:27:01
Perhaps in time cryptocurrencies will become less volatile like Fiat exchanges. Only then I suppose we will see much more adoption
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:32:25
Brilliant observation thank you 
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:48:18
Time value of money will take effect 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:43:39
Personally I think regulation is good, people won’t have so much fear about it 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:20:15
We need to be mindful that all this is really down to speculation and anything can happen or be made to happen ... 
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:50:42
I honestly think that governments will induce regulation and tax somehow to curb its growth and trajectory. Were in an interesting time!
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:18:44
That makes sense ... although I think Fiat isn’t going anywhere 
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:04:37
Yes however with market correction taking effect the gains will slow down 
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:10:11
That very funny and quite interesting 
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:07:49
I think we can speculate that it doesn’t have capacity to be a unifying currency ... maybe Ethereum
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:20:29
True 
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:31:13
If you look at how Apple traded as a ‘bubble’ in the beginning and how it hit lows but kept climbing ... BTC is similar in growth right now
