Anyone buying in the $1-1100 range is an early adopter and will make out like a bandit.  It might take 4-5 years but who cares?  I plonked down my cash expecting a 5-10yr investment so could care less about current volatility.

Bank of America made a decent case it would be $1300 but a lot of others claim much much higher.  This is interesting from a potential point of view:

I think it's pretty good news that it's trading at $720 right now.  A GREAT many naysayers said it would be 0 by now after that China news, but no it bounced back.  Bitcoin is proving to be quite resilient at this stage.  Also, we have a LOT of VC cash being pumped in right now and it could be months before we start to see any of that have it's positive effects.  As VCs and new startups come on line we will see that upward curve to mainstream.  All we really need is for Bitcoin to be as easy to use as Paypal.  Not that Paypal is easy but it's easy enough that it garnered mass adoption.  Once a luddite like my Dad is capable of getting and spending some bitcoin we are off.  My old man can use ebay and paypal no probs but bitcoin?  Hell no, not at this stage.

Bitcoin will be fine.  A lot of your concern basically comes down to processing power (in present day).  Don't forget the processing power of your smartphone by 2020 will fit inside a red blood cell.  Computing power for bitcoin processing and transactions will be moot very soon.  It will certainly be moot by the time Bitcoin really gets mainstream.  I have zero concerns about "efficiency" because everyone will have supercomputers in their pockets and GB+ internet by the time this could be a concern.  And what is that stat over US wealth?  300 citizens own 80% of the wealth or something?  It's nothing new.

I did the numbers on my international small business.  I would save roughly $7k US a year in transaction fees alone.

Before you "see" it make sure you don't have some Malware running that snaps a screenshot and send it's offshore, etc.  I keep all my coins offline on paper, bip38 encrypted.
