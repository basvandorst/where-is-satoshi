have you considered depositing the btc directly to skrill, you just need to be aware of the 1% fee and low limits.

Bittylicious is great with the FPS, I have also used bitpanda and kraken's sepa transfers as rates are great and funds banked within a few hours, will look into revolut that has been mentioned

yes but low limits

Probably not most profitable but not a scam. The minergate group is affiliated to Charlie Shrem and his exchange service.

he did state the purchases were cash, so no exchangers, anyway I agree with the comment of taking his business elsewhere

skrill and payza come to mind

I think coinify.com 'may' take your card, no harm in trying, however not sure if they do US transactions

ok, would you consider getting an account with spectrocoin.com (european exchanger), just transfer btc/eth to them from your blockchain.info wallet and its a seemless transfer to your skrill account. 
I know it seems to add a few more steps, but its hassle free

Exchanges like spectrocoin and bitpanda allow direct transfer to Skrill, so just transfer your cryptos from kraken, bitstamp, coinbase to spectrocoin (eth, dash, btc) and bitpanda (btc,bch,dash, ltc) then do a transfer to skrill.
You may need to get verified with spectro and bitpanda to withdraw reasonable amounts

established but small European exchanges that have been around at least 3 years, I think not!!
