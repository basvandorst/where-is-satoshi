Just shut up dude, who the fuck are you to decide what bitcoin is...
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:22:39
You mean:  "if Core becomes an Altcoin"
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:21:53
Exaclty Core will be the Altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:26:00
Wow what a bunch of bullshit
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:53:42
At least it's more reliable than depending on posts of this subreddit.
Where everybody is in a filter bubble.
The only way to reliably measure support is through hash rate and that's where Bitcoin Unlimited is winning
@_date: 2017-04-04 10:58:14
All my friends support Bitcoin Unlimited, soo if you talk to bitcoin people in the real world you'll experience the same.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:01:41
Oh do i ? It's just a variable in the source code which is set 1MB. 
And yes i know it's a hardfork and i understand the protocol better than you.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:02:56
Except it's not

UASF =&gt; BIGGEST BULLSHIT EVER
@_date: 2017-05-16 10:21:56
so what ?
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:13:52
Yes bigger blocks but not segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:39:17
Big Blocks are a no brainer. You don't even need to change 1 entire Line in the code.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:46:10
Yes this is true.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:18:27
lol good luck 
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:30:13
No :p

I think uglymelt is qualified as teacher, because he knows what he is talking about, you don't
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:34:37
Ahhhm sorry but this isn't a glance of the future since segwit will most likely not succeed in bitcoin. Check the latest mining blocks. Bitcoin Unlimited is currently at an All Time High with their Blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-16 10:49:23
I'm actively in Bitcoin since 2013 and know about bitcoin since 2011 so yeah... I know Bitcoin and back in the days the vision was to replace fiat and become the new world currency. Helping 3rd wolrd countries etc. now transaction fees are so high that people there have  work an entire day to be able to afford 1 transaction. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:56:24
Decentralised doesn't mean everybody can run it. Decentralised just means that everybody has the same rights and can run it. No central authority. Also with 6Mbps you can easily download a 10 MB Block without having any serious disadvantage.
13 seconds vs 10 Minutes . That disadavntage is ridicolous.
OMG. MORE TRANSACTIONS = MORE FEES =&gt; NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. 
According to your logic the best thing to do would be to limit one block to 1 transaction then miners would make the most profit. That's not how this works.
Also the difficulty adjustment acts as a feedback loop, if mining isn't profitable =&gt; less people will mine =&gt;  mining will get more profitable =&gt; more people will mine.  
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:04:59
UASF is a very bad idea. Stupid as fuck 
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:11:39
Assuming you are right which i have my doubts, maybe it doesn't have widespread community consensus because core developers are talking shit about what would happen if the blocksize gets increased and scaring people. Also a lot of people are just blind followers anyway, who need authority and can't think for themselves.
And that's just apart from the fact that you can't measure "community support" that's why we have things like proof of work. 
Otherwise we could've created a cryptocurrency where we just measure community support to determine which chain is the correct one. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 08:18:28
What a bullshit analogy
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:06:41
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:51:40
Don't get me wrong Lightning is a great idea, for handling lots of transaction volume. 
Lightning isn't really bitcoin specific, it's a way to handle transactions send from peer to peer by utilizing a blockchain with smart contract capabilities. So you can build lightning on top of a lot of blockchains(ether, litecoin, etc.).
I'm not an enemy of lightning. I just HATE IT that people are actively trying to cripple bitcoin in order to force people to 2nd Layer Solutions.
2nd Layer Solutions: Awesome and very much needed.
Crippling Bitcoin to force people to 2nd Layer Solutions for profit: VERY BAD
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:06:40
That's just a bullshit argument . Just because blocks are bigger it doesn't mean it's less decentralised. I have a 120 Mbit/s Connection i can Download 14 Blocks in 1 second and storing also isn't a Problem. 1 TB HDD cost 27€. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:29:18
If core developers were not blocking progress by refusing to increase the blocksize bitcoin would be $5000 by now
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:16:23
Only buy as much USD as you can afford to lose ! 
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:38:40
Let's say miners need 10BTC in Fees , what is more realistic :
1000 People paying: 10mbTC ~ 18$ per Transaction 
1 000 000 People paying: 10µBTC ~ 0.018$ per Transaction.
Warning: Rhetorical Question.
No sane person would pay 18$ for a Transaction but people leave cents at the cashier simply because they don't care.
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:07:34
And yes it does improve the situation by not artifically limiting the transactions
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:07:45
Just spam, core developers would say
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:13:02
Yes but scaling something completly different, NOT Bitcoin.
Lightning Transactions are NOT Bitcoin Transactions
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:57:29
Next thing you gonna say is that your grandma still uses a 54k modem and therefore it's not decentralised...
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:10:11
oh then tell me master how do you objectively measure user support. 


One person controlling 60% of bitcoin accounts on reddit also doesn't mean it has widespread community support. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:11:11
It's necessary since almost 6 months now
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:46:53
No because a bitcoin transaction is a transaction which is on the blockchain. Otherwise it's just a message signed with a private Key
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:31:31
Yes exactly, that's what i'm saying a google datacenter should be the metric /s. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:18:57
Are you stupid ? It's true. Value is always subjective !
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:50:12
HAPPY NOT SCALING.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:13:14
Oh you want a translation, you just need to tell me and i'll provide you with one ;) . It basically means that the comparison is flawed.
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:30:29
UASF = STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
I like the high price. My worries are focused on transactions not being processed. Along with a landscape dictated by blcokstream and toxic core developers blocking progress and 
 trying to stop on chain scaling.
There i corrected it for you.

In germany there is a saying: "Nicht alles was hinkt ist ein Vergleich" .

you could have least put some files in the folder :p
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:32:53
WAKE UP AND USE BITCOIN UNLIMITED. AND STOP FOLLOWING BLOCKSTREAM CORE
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:29:37
yes satoshis vision was to cripple bitcoin and let blockstream a private company controll it /s
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:34:21
no i don't organize them

I don't think that this is spanish.
