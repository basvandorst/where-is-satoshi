don't play into FUD (feat uncertainty doubt) and just HODL next time. trading is for those who are ready to lose it

18 months from now transaction fees and delays won't even be an issue

yes but with enough money we can modify lambos to get extra ride height on demand, just flip that switch right over there and the car lifts up 2 feet

following others is a bad idea, it makes your actions manipulatable

i need a car too, while i could afford one right now by using a good chunk of my crypto i am waiting until it grows a lot lot more, i can use a bike or ride-share for now. for as you see- i'm in a rocket ship, and it's heading for the moon. it wouldn't be a good idea to jump out at cloud level, thats how you end up falling back down to earth

anyone can spread misinformation when competing for business. while i was checking reviews for various BTC/ETH purchase services i've found a lot of negative things about literally every *other* service and nothing but good (non-shill) type reviews of gemini. some time has passed since then so available information is different now im sure. the ios app store reviews are a good place to check for real world customer experience since many competitors have app interfaces. anyway my experience with gemini has been great so i guess believe whatcha want :)
