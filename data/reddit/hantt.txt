That is genius, don't judge a book by it's cover but guess it by it's table of contents.

Kind of a dumb answer.

I want to trust you but I just can't because of your name...

I'm sorry, I meant to say Bitcoin to the moon, bro. Kinda interesting that you can consider a simple question ridiculous.

Something is fishy here

I personally don't believe in religions but I don't think they are fake they are in fact very real. If you think that most are scams and that I'm suggesting Bitcoin is a scam, I am not. I'm simply asking a question about what similar qualities there are between a social protocol based realized through computers versus a social protocol that is not.

Best argument I've heard that clicked with skeptics is that it is a hedge against traditional instruments(personally I'm not sure if that's 100 percent true) but it does seem to be a way that they can see the value

I think they all represent a forum of social protocol, Bitcoin is also in my "opinion" a social protocol which is actualized through computing. I find it an interesting a comparison but I didn't think I'd get so much hate for posting the question. I'd expect this type of response from an actual religion forum where most people are zealots.

What if it had a twist? like he had no money and that it was all a dream, but then he remember meeting you and talking about it. Suddenly you pull out the money he dreamt about. Then you are guys both on the moon

Yes, Auntie trust laws were implemented to combat this exact problem. Banks must trust you with credit use based on the perception of an reasonable aunt.
