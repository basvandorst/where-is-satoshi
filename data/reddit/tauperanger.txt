That's called gambling and you shouldn't have done it if you needed the money. There are much more stable investments out there than Bitcoin.

Maybe even 4k, or 3k, or 6k, or 7k. Oh wait no one has any fucking clue, remember?

Not at all. The OP has no idea what will happen with either one - they are both gambles. That is the only similarity that matters to the point at hand.

lmao - there is one of these comments on literally every post about falling BTC prices. The irony is that people could be saying this in 20 years when the price is at $9. It's one of those comments-without-content that you often hear from hedge fund bros and finance "gurus". Of course it will "rise and fall". There will always be people who incorrectly predict sudden increases, and there will always be people who say "no no, it's going to be a bumpy ride" immediately afterward.

Why are you asking this question? Literally no one knows what will happen. You might as well ask: "does it make sense to bet on the Raiders winning the next Super Bowl?" You could buy at 8k and then have it skyrocket to 50k. Or it could dip down to 4k and you lose half of your money.

No. One. Knows. It could be 9k tomorrow. It could be 3k tomorrow.

So if I buy now, by the Law of BTC Averages it will go up and I'll make money (ngin-x couldn't lose any \*more\* money...right?)

What if it doesn't go below 6.5k?
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:32:12
Ya but since we're buying the dip now we can leverage 100x and get sweet profits. Buy 1 BTC at 9.5k with 100x leverage and you make 100k when it goes back up to 10.5k! If you get liquidated then work at McDonalds until you can buy another dip! Failure proof!

can go to zero and stay there
