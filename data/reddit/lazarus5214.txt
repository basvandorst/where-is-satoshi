I'm not 100%, but I'm pretty sure:
The Google 2FA "seeds" are one time codes that will work at any time. 
Go to your gmail account. When prompted for your 2FA, enter one of the seeds. Now you have access to your account. 
Go to your bitcoin wallet. When prompted, give a different seed. This should give you access to your coins. 
Then you can reinstate 2FA and scan the QR codes so your various accounts will be back in your 2FA app. 
Good luck!

I copied and pasted the private key into an email to myself, and changed 10 random characters that I committed to memory. 
I'm sure r/bitcoin in general will frown upon this as being incredibly insecure, and I'm aware of that, but a) good luck trying to get into my email with a very secure password and 2FA and b) if you do get into my email, good luck not only figuring out which 10 characters I've modified, but also guessing what they actually originally were. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:41:42
I agree, but to put it in perspective: banks initiate 1000s of transactions per second, which may take 3 days to clear, but at the same time, they are clearing 1000s of transactions which were made 3 days ago, so, I think, as a rolling total, they are initiating 1000s of transactions while also clearing 1000s of transactions.

The block reward is set to halve every four years, on average, assuming a 10 minute interval between blocks. Eventually, the block reward will be zero, and it is assumed that transaction fees will incentivize mining. After all the halvings, no more new bitcoins will be mined. At that point, the total number of bitcoins in existence will be a few satoshis short of 21 million.

As u/coincrazyy has said, I'm not sure how bit wallet handles change addresses. I've been using bit wallet as a sort of savings account, and until I figure out how change addresses work with this wallet, if/when I spend any of the bits now held there, I will sweep the private key into another wallet that properly handles change. 
Maybe bit wallet does handle change addresses well, but I haven't found any info on it and I'm not risking losing any bits from lack of understanding. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 10:51:32
I absolutely agree with your analysis, but I'd like to clarify that it's closer to $1.5 million than it is to $2 million. 
25 bitcoins per block x 6 blocks per hour x 24 hours per day x $380 per bitcoin  = $1.368 million

We did an experiment in math class. Half the class flipped a coin 100 times and recorded the results, the other half imagined flipping a coin 100 times and recorded the results. The professor was able to determine with 95% accuracy which lists were randomly generated and which lists were imaginary random generated. 
In 100 coin flips, it's very likely to get a series of 8 or more heads in a row. 
In the fake random series, no student put more than 4 or five heads in a row, as they thought any more in a row wouldn't be random enough.

There is a checksum, so not every randomly generated series of characters is a valid address. The address you made is not valid, you cannot send bitcoins to it. 
1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE is a valid address. The "f59kuE" at the end is a checksum. You can send bitcoins to this address. But no one knows the private key, so, as of now, the ~2 BTC in that address cannot be spent.

A block, which includes transactions, is finite in size. If you tried to push through a million transactions, it would take time for all those to be mined, as more and more blocks are found. 
When a block is mined, the miner gets to keep all the transaction fees. So they will include the highest fee transactions first, and then fill the block with transactions, even those without fees.
The higher your fee, compared to all the other pending transactions, the higher a miner will prioritize your transaction.

If your talking about each public address, I'm sure someone has scanned the blockchain and noted all addresses with amount greater than zero. You could probably find one with some googling.

Any messages "signed" with a private key can ONLY be decrypted using the corresponding public key, and vice versa. 
This means I can sign a message with my private key, and you knowing my public key, KNOW that I sent that message. 
It also means I can sign a message with YOUR public key, and only YOU can open it using your private key, so I know that you and only you will get the message. 
It also means that I can sign a message with my private key and then sign THAT message with your public key. Therefore, only you can read it AND you know it came from me, by using your private key and then my public key to unlock it. 
Yea, it's pretty awesome and I'm only scratching the surface here.

@_date: 2015-03-18 23:57:03
These are good points I hadn't thought of, thanks. 
However, a block buried deep in a block chain is very easy to change, if most mining members agree to make it. So in your example, the members of this Notary Association could change it on a whim, as long as a majority agree. 
I guess my point is that a *decentralized* block chain won't work without an internal incentive. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:24:56
Correct. If you have a blockchain without an incentive, it will need to be centralized. At that point, why not just keep an excel spreadsheet. Centralized ledgers are an extremely old concept.

Coinbase. 
They're extremely reputable. I've been using them for almost two years. 
They recently implemented their vault feature, which is a a 2-of-3 multi signature cold storage wherein the user controls two of the keys and Coinbase controls the third.  
These means four things. It is impossible for Coinbase to move any coins without your permission. You don't need Coinbase's permission to move your coins. If you lose either one of your keys, Coinbase can help you recover the coins. If you lose both keys, the coins are lost forever.

Sounds like you mean coinbox.me, a lot if faucets use this. See, every transaction costs about a penny, so these faucet sites want to bundle the transactions to you, by sending 0.00005500 bitcoin one time, paying one transactions fee, rather than sending 0.00000250 bitcoin twenty two times and paying 22 transaction fees.

I used a laptop that was lying around my house, hadn't been used in probably a year or two. I formatted the drive and reinstalled Windows (I should probably use Linux, I know, I'm trying to learn) and immediately disabled the ethernet port and wifi.
From now on I'll use shorthand ON for my online computer and OFF for my separate offline computer that will never access the internet.
Using ON, I downloaded the .exe files for electrum and truecrypt. I put them on a usb drive and transferred them to OFF. 
I then installed electrum on OFF and created a new wallet. I then installed truecrypt on OFF and encrypted the entire drive. This took about 2 days to complete encryption. 
Then I accessed my electrum wallet on OFF and aquired the Master Public Key, as well as a few deposit addresses, copied them to the usb drive and carried it to ON. I installed electrum onto ON, and when prompted to create a new wallet, I entered the Master Public Key.
Now, I can use ON to monitor my wallet, but OFF is the only one that has the private key. ON cannot spend without OFF's permission. If I want to make a transaction, I use ON to create an unsigned transaction, copy that to usb drive, bring it to OFF where it will become a signed transaction, copy to usb and bring back to ON where it will broadcast the signed transaction.

I went thru the same struggle. I wanted to buy some and watched the market value fluctuate for about 3 weeks. It got tiresome, you watch the market waiting for a good time to buy, but you'll only know in hindsight. 
I recommend my plan of action. If you don't have any, buy some right now, be it 1 or 0.1 BTC. Get in on the action now, standing at the sidelines is unrewardingly stressful.

Correct me as needed, but it seems as tho by this logic, a rational person would not buy ANYTHING with their USD, because they could use that money to buy BTC. 
The way I see it, spending bitcoins is the same as spending dollars, because at the end of the transaction, either scenario plays out like, "I should have invested (or kept) that value in BTC."  
I don't see how it's a problem and I don't think I'm sweeping it under the rug. Thoughts?
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:50:39
Correct. I click "buy" and the coins show up in my account as "pending", but I can still send them to my cold storage address. The transaction shows up on the blockchain within minutes and coinbase takes their money from me a few days later.

Bitcoin is set up so that, on average, one block is mined every 10 minutes. Now, a block is mined when a miner solves an arbitrarily hard math problem, a problem that is extremely difficult to solve, but easy to verify a correct answer. 
The problem is not functionally solvable, all that processing power is used to make many, many guesses until a solution is found by chance. 
Now if you want to increase your chances of finding a solution, you need more processing power. If the miners increase their guesses ten-fold, they should find solutions 10 times faster than before.
The Bitcoin protocol responds to this action and jumps the difficulty to match the processing power so that the 10 minute solution average is maintained. 
Note that as the difficulty increases, miners may value bitcoins more because they are harder to obtain, but the price is determined by the market of buying and selling.

Correct, if bitcoin only overtook gold as a major store of value, it could not reach 21 trillion dollar market cap. But bitcoin is more than a store of value, it's also a payment protocol, like PayPal or western union, and a currency, like the dollar or euro. That's not to say it will reach $21 trillion, but it definitely has the potential to outpace gold as bitcoin is much more than a store of value.

Get an offline computer. This can be a physical device or a separate installation on your current computer.
[Offline PC] Install Electrum via a USB-Key.
[Offline PC] Create a new wallet. Write down the seed and memorize it, after which you should probably destroy the seed or keep it safe in a lockbox.
[Offline PC] Go to Settings -&gt; Import/Export and copy your "Master Public Key" and put it in a text file on your USB-Key.
[Online PC] Install Electrum and select Restore in the dialog box shown on the first start up, use the "Master Public Key".
[Online PC, existing Electrum installation] See below how to make Electrum to restore or open alternative, non-default, wallet.
You now have an online wallet where you can check your balances and give out new addresses, but you can't however spend the coins. So if an attacker would be able take over your online computer your coins can't be lost.
To make a transaction do the following:
[Online PC] Go to the send tab and make a transaction. Instead of sending it, Electrum will detect a seedless wallet and query for a location to save the transaction. Select your USB-Key.
[Offline PC] Go to Settings -&gt; Import/Export -&gt; "Load raw transaction". Select your transaction from the USB-Key. It will detect it's not signed and will prompt you to do so now. Fill in your password and sign the transaction. Save the new, signed, transaction to your USB-Key.
[Online PC] Go to Settings -&gt; Import/Export -&gt; "Load raw transaction". Select the signed transaction and it will ask you if you want to broadcast it.
I find this to be the most secure way, as control of your coins is not accessible by the internet, and if all your possessions were to burn to the ground, you can restore your wallet thru a passphrase.

Here in the US, gas stations like to price to the tenth of a cent, like a gallon costs not $3.49, but $3.499. 
Suppose the US introduces a coin worth a tenth of a penny. Now, suppose the government didn't just throw them out to increase the money supply (actual inflation), but set up an exchange, where one could bring pennies, receive 10 newly minted coins valued at 1/10th of a penny, and the penny that was given is destroyed in Mordor.
In this case, as the new coins are added as a unit of divisibity, and not an increase in total money (actual inflation, remember I'm destroying the pennies that are traded in), I think it's clear that this would not cause inflation. The total money supply remains the same, there just happens to be more divisibility. This is analogous to adding more decimals to bitcoin. 
And yea, I posed it this way so you can't keep shouting "but gold and pizzas are made of atoms and can't be divided forever while bitcoins certainly can, I don't agree with your analogy" because we absolutely could continue issuing higher and higher divisibility coins, the 1/1000th penny coin, etc.

I suppose what I'm trying to say is that difficulty may have some impact on price (ie miners want more money for the harder work), but there are a multitude of factors at play here to determine the price.

Coinbase says something like, "using a paper wallet leaves the private key out of our hands, consider any money sent to your paper wallet a withdrawal from coinbase. "
The paper wallet should have 2 QR codes and associated keys. One begins with a 5, that's the private key, never ever share it. Then there is one that begins with a 1, that is the public key. There is no harm in sharing this number. You can go to blockchain.info and enter the public key into the search bar to keep track if the amounts in the wallet.

From what I understand, there's a good chance they will be selling them off in "lots". 
For example, say they have 1000 coins to liquidate. They seperate them into 100 lots of 10 bitcoins each. Then the bidding starts. For simplicity's sake, say there are only 4 people interested in buying. Adam offers $10 per lot, Brian offers $20 per lot, Casey offers $5 per lot, and Dave offers $50 per lot. 
Dave wins and is allowed to buy as many lots as he pleases at the price he bid; he can buy 1 or 10 or all 100 at his bid price of $50 per lot. When he is satisfied, if any lots remain, Brian is now allowed to purchase as many lots out of those that remain at the price per lot he had bid. If any remain, Adam now can do the same and buy the lots at his bid. This continues until all lots are gone.

Then I became suspicious that it was used for phishing, to gain access to my coinbase account, so I immediately changed my password and enabled 2-factor authentification on my coinbase account.

I believe inputs.io is 100% legit, tho I'm just a random internet stranger with less than 6 months experience with any bitcoin service.

Happy Cakeday, my friend!
On Friday, I'll be receiving my first bitcoins bought from an exchange. [I'm pretty psyched!](

I'm in a similar situation. 
I put everything I can spare into bitcoins. Everything I can afford to lose. That means AFTER my bills are paid, I've got gas money, and I  have some kicking around money for cigarettes, beer, and entertainment, AFTER all my finances are taken care of, I buy bitcoins. Like $10-100 every two weeks, depending on how much I can spare. 
If bitcoin collapses tomorrow, I'll have lost $500. But that money was slowly accumulated and it's not even in my mind when paying bills.
Having said that, I think bitcoin is a revolution that's just now learning how to walk, you're early to the party!

I made an account just for you...


"There's no question that PayPal wants to lead the discussion about new innovative and better regulatory models," says Brian Bieron, executive director of global public policy at eBay, which owns PayPal.
While "no regulation" is not a real solution, Bieron says, both established companies and startups can work collaboratively to push for regulation that meets their common goals.
In a new paper, PayPal recommends that regulators use data analytics to measure performance of a company and make regulations based on their findings, instead of basing regulations on design standards as happens today.
Data analytics "is something that hasn't been used…in the regulatory setting," Bieron says. "Payments offers a great place to explore this because there's so much data…and so much innovation going on."
Bieron is presenting the paper, "21st Century Regulation: Innovation and Growth" in Washington D.C. on Oct. 29 during a policy luncheon hosted by the Progressive Policy Institute.
PayPal will present localized versions of the paper in Singapore and Italy.  Rohan Mahadevan, vice president of PayPal Asia Pacific and Hanne Melin, policy strategy counsel for Europe, the Middle East and Africa for eBay, will present the papers in their respective regions.
The paper advocates for SMART Governance, a decision-making model based on securing data on performance, using machines to organize databases, creating algorithms to derive insights, reassessing results and targeting insights to improve performance.
"There is a pretty chronic frustration in the technology industry as a whole that regulatory entities are too slow…to keep up with the innovation happening," Bieron says. We want regulations "built on results instead of on defining the business model," he says.
For example, Know Your Customer rules could be improved, says Bieron. Design standards suggest that all customers are required to enroll for accounts in-person, but with businesses moving online this can be complicated, he says. Instead, businesses could leverage social networks and other online information sources as better indicators of a consumer's identity, he says.
Some players in the money transmitting market have talked about a single uniform license, similar to the process in the European Union, instead of the state-by-state licensing currently required in the U.S.
The Payment Services Directive in the European Union allows a regulated payment services provider in one country to expand into another country with the same licensing and supervision. The second country's authorities are notified and, if they choose, have 30 days to investigate further and object to the company doing business in their territory.
A dozen or more states have begun participating in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System, a portal that allows money transmitter startups to apply for several state licenses altogether, says Adam Atlas, an attorney at his own practice.
Atlas advises emerging payments players on regulatory processes.
"The work that states do in thinking about, reviewing, granting and auditing licensed entities is much more costly than it is profitable," says Atlas. "States stand to gain financially by cooperating at least on the [money transmitter] application."
PayPal currently provides services for 173 million consumers and businesses in 193 markets around the world.
PayPal is looking at SMART governance as a longer-term prospect, Bieron says. He suggests the reform is implemented in a safe harbor kind of environment, where the new model is running parallel to the old model.
This could be a good time for regulatory reform, as many regulators and payments companies are taking steps to understand each other and startups are being pushed to be proactive and pursue relationships with regulators.
The federal government has also been somewhat receptive to learning about new payment systems, such as the Bitcoin digital currency. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network recently hosted the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group, to brief representatives from the FBI, IRS, FDIC and others on the nature of the virtual currency.
Bitcoin businesses came into the spotlight after Fincen published guidance in March categorizing exchangers and administrators as money services businesses. Many Bitcoin companies are having trouble getting started in the U.S. due to the cost and complexity of getting licensed in each state.
Plus most banks are hesitant to take on the risk of doing business with certain companies and regions. Recently Barclays, citing risk, dropped Dahabshiil, a Somali money transmitter, while U.S. Bancorp continued pursuing a relationship.

That sounds spot on, as far as simplification goes. 
Another cool feature is that anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the private key. So you can send a message to someone using their public key and only those with access to the private key can decrypt it. 
This also works in reverse. Anything encrypted by a private key can only be decrypted using the corresponding public key. This allows you to verify to others that you own the private key while only exposing the public key. Neat!

Some related points. 
There used to be a US coin that represented a half penny. It was discontinued because it was considered to have too little buying power. At the time of the half penny's discontinuation, it had more buying power than today's dime. We don't need to go as low as pennies, in fact many agree we should lose the penny, search YouTube for John green's or CGPGrey's opinion/research. 
We will have nearly 2,000 million million satoshis in the near future. 
To make it clear, I don't think bitcoin will be the one world currency, tho it will remain very useful and valuable, but I just wanted to point out that there are plenty of satoshis around to represent a large portion of the world's wealth.

I've been buying. I think it's just a panic.
The following is simply my personal take and is based on nothing but my meager understanding. 
When btcchina opened up and began booming, that market was consistently on the rise, seemingly singlehandedly driving the price up. The Chinese market was interested for two reasons; speculative investment and commodity trading. There is not BitPay equivalent. Now that the Chinese government made it clear that it will not allow BItcoin to act as a currency, those same two reasons for the price drive still exist. It's not like the Chinese were using it as a currency and the government banned it; the party has isolated bitcoin before it can be used as a currency. This leads me to believe the crash is panic induced.

Thank you! That is very helpful! Just for clarification:
Since I created a brand new Electrum wallet that I can restore through a seed, I should import my private key, then send the imported bitcoins to an address that my Electrum wallet created, and when I restore my wallet through a seed, I will have control over the bitcoins, and my paper wallet private key will no longer have control?

You spend dollars on things you want, yes? But every dollar you spend is a dollar that you could have used to buy bitcoins. Therefore, every time you spend any amount of wealth, be it dollars, gold, or bitcoin, you are missing out on Bitcoin's potential growth. 
Spending bitcoin has the same opportunity cost as spending dollars.

To answer the only question I can, I used to go to landofbitcoin.com for free coins. It is a faucet as well as a link to over 40 other faucets. You could spend 2 hours a day hitting all those faucets to collect $0.10, or you could just buy like $5 worth of bitcoins in one night and save your time for something else. When you run the cost/benefit of these free bitcoin sites, you'll realize you're paying yourself $0.25 an hour and it's not worth it

Listen, you don't want a paper wallet. You can't spend from a paper wallet without creating another. It's a hassle. 
You want an offline electrum wallet. Get a laptop or desktop that you can dedicate totally to use as an offline wallet. Format reinstall. 
On an online computer, download the install files for true crypt and electrum. Use a USB drive to transfer those files to the offline computer. 
Install true crypt and electrum on the offline computer. Use true crypt to encrypt the hard drive of the offline computer. 
Open electrum and create a new wallet on the offline computer. You will be provided with a 12 word pass phrase; this is used to restore the wallet if you lose your data in a fire or something. Tell this paraphrase to no one. I would store in an encrypted folder, use a USB drive to transfer it to an online computer, and email it to yourself or put it in your Dropbox. 
Now when you have safely stored the pass phrase and the wallet is created on the offline computer, you can access the master public key, copy it to a USB drive, and use that to access the wallet on the online computer. 
Now you can check the balance and keep track of the bitcoins, you can only spend them if the transaction is signed by the offline computer. 
Google "electrum offline wallet". It's doesn't take too long to fully understand and it is extremely secure.

Hi there. I'm a 25 year old landscaper, by no means an IT professional, far from it. I started reading about bitcoins in early spring 2013, and bought my first coins in August. I believe I have a very good understanding of handling a secure wallet. 
I'm at work now, but if you PM me any questions, I'd be happy to answer them when I get home, I'm sure I could help.

Yes. It is much better to switch. 
Now, I don't think this will happen, but suppose on Monday, the US declares bitcoin illegal. Being a US based company, coinbase would shut down immediately and you would no longer have those coins. 
With bitcoins, if you don't have the private key, or if you have the private key and so does someone else, they aren't your coins. You're just trusting that someone else is competent enough. 
I keep most of my coins in offline storage and a small amount in coinbase I'm case I want to sell some, and another small amount in my blockchain.info wallet. I had some in inputs.io and you know how that turned out.
