Lol. I was living on $12k usd per year since leaving high school in 2007 up until finding more steady work in 2016. I did not have time for headlines man.

Didn't follow Bitcoins till I heard in the news in mid 2016, then went looking for my wallet and it took me 3 moths to figure out the password to the .dat file.

Thank you for your kind support

It's not greed man, it's just I haven't built anything to earn this money so I'm not going to begin living as if I'm special or something. I still need to do a lot of self work that's more important than worrying about money. As long as my rent is paid, eat decently and give a little back, I'm free to continue working on myself and my goals until I'm ready for the next stage of my life...whatever that is.

I got lucky man, this was not an educated investment

I don't get it, why would I sell them? I have a job I love and never asked for this. I'm already pursuing a very specific purpose in life. Why would I halt my dreams just because I!have $100MM? Trust me, money is not what is going to help me get to where I'm aiming to go.

No one knows and no one ever will. Once I realized that the value is private and I can be wealthy in secret, I realized that I don't have to change my goals or my image just because I know had access to some money. Plus I come from a very poor family, telling them that I have this kind of wealth is not a good idea. Especially since I did not earn it through hard work, they might not attach any value to it.

Mid-2016 yes
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:28:16
Yes, I spent about $200 on these. At the time, I thought there was no worse way to have spent my money. I felt devastated for weeks, really hurt over spending those $200 on something I didn't even understand.

I don't get it...sorry for my ignorance, i still don't know much about BTC. The .dat file was stuck in a .dmg file that I encrypted. It was the only way I knew how to encrypt a file from computer science class.

I'm currently attending a lot of conferences to learn more about BTC and to see what I got myself into.

I don't want anyone knowing that I'm wealthy, that includes the government

Can't figure it out. According to my accountant, it'd be a tax nightmare.

I cant find the guy anywhere, he barely spoke English. He needed the money so he passed me a USB and told me that it had a software in it that I could sell worth exactly $200.

Thank you. Didn't open my wallet till mid-2016 from buying them in 2009. Plus, I sold my laptop in 2014 because I was short $400 on my rent and luckily I made a backup of the drive before wiping the laptop's drive for the buyer. Took me over 3 months to figure out the password to the .dat file.
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:29:18
Sure. Might as well just send me your wallet address and I'll send them all to you. Lol.

I bought it from a Chinese exchange student. He barely spoke English. He needed the money so he passed me a USB and told me that it had a software in it that I could sell worth exactly $200, so I said fuck it, went to the ATM, gave him $200 and he passed me the USB. I went to verify that there was software in the USB and there was, I just had no idea wth it was so I felt duped.
