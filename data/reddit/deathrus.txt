Shitpost but replying. Looking foward to the new feature. I use Robinhood myself and avid trader in stocks, etfs and crypto. I am excited about the crypto portion. I have assets across many exchanges, consolidation  will be nice, no fees a giant +.
This  is a big step towards ADOPTION and mainstream which is what we should all be happy about.

I thought about it. I've read accounts get closed   due to transactions from crypto related entities , like CoinBase and USDT. I would also rather be legit as well and not lie.

Ive bounced the idea around and may risk it if I cannot find a better solution. 
My fear is getting my account frozen for "to many suspicious transactions." or any other crap reason I've read.
 If your account is frozen, how do you get the stored fiat out? I assume it's not easy legit or not.
Several solutions from everyone,   more to think about.Thanks!

It was close and local. 
Me not knowing jack squat about business ownership... I was looking for help only to see rejection( which means you are doing something right, most  people in history were rejected; small minds have trouble grasping big concepts )... Don't worry, 20xs better now..
I really should of turned to first.

I have and  it's been a nightmare. I had to separate all my business transactions from my personal account. Lucky, I am handy with Excel and Adobe Pro. 
I created an EIN few months ago as my operation  grew and would like to attempt to get better tax breaks and benefits of an EIN. It also scales better for future use when I may hire employees and will help protect my ssn, and personal accounts.
