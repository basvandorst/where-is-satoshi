What's the third best exchange for US citizens? I am already verified at trading and coinbase and gemini but want another fallback that allows fiat deposits.

I'm just thinking about how the authenticator could be compromised if someone could gain access to your email password and for example get your dropbox password.  Is there something that would prevent the info from being on more than 1 device?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:24:05
If they took credit/debit cards, I wouldn't hesitate to switch in a heartbeat.

I don't know why the twins get a lot of hate. I've never seen the social network, but they can't be that bad can they?  Is it just because they're wealthy?  All people that wealthy are kind of off anyway, but if they can do something good for bitcoin I dont see the big deal.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:50:11
Haha, I didn't even think about this.

Fuck, are you serious? He's got a lot invested in his bitcoin mining business, I'm surprised he would shill for bcash. I know he's been shilling random altcoins on his twitter and he's doing what best for his business empire, but did he go into more detail about bcash replacing bitcoin? Do you have a link?

I just looked at that app.  Does the syncing to other devices make it potentially more vulnerable?  What if I only have 1 device I want to keep the authenticator codes on?  Does it sync using one of their central servers and is it store on there?

Why march? Final deadline for ETF decisions?

What's the advantage for Bakkt itself to require ownership of the bitcoin?  I understand why it's good for people who support bitcoin, but what does the company get out if it?
@_date: 2018-06-03 23:38:51
Sorry man. So when did they make the switch? When you were walking outside?
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:30:01
down 100k in unrealized gains or money invested?

Did they not let you send before? I dont get it
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:35:33
How sophisticated is this, really?  No legitimate sites let you buy with paypal and private transactions involving crypto are rare due to lack of trust in such transactions.  Seems like a very roundabout way to affect the price of crypto.

No puppet. You're the puppet.

That really doesnt look good for this year, then, does it?  it's 3700 so far and can go lower

What kind of hate speech lyrics are they accused of promoting?  It's not just a random death metal label, right?

How did you get the newspaper? I always search ebay but can never find one
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:35:56
No legitimate crypto sites let you buy with paypal i mean.

Not that I'm arguing, but why is he a fool?
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:41:14
Are there any discussions about people who have looked at the open-source code for potential irregularities?  Would someone be able to glance at the code and be able to something suspicious, or would it require deep study of the code?

What's the premium and do all coinstar machines support this? If not, when will all support?

I would cream my pants if ETH was back at that price right now.

"As we get closer to the last bitcoin that will be mined a couple of years out."
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:57:56
I see, so the community could rebel by not using software that supports the new supply amount? So node consensus is what defines bitcoin and not hashing power, or would it be a matter of semantics as to what is really "bitcoin"? I am just thinking about a scenario that will probably not happen but I know people talk about various doomsday scenarios so I thought I would try to understand.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:42:31
haha, yeah
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:58:45
Ah, thank you very much!
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:31:57
Ugh, I used to use electrum, now I only use ledger wallet.  I'm not looking forward to a software hack of ledger live to redirect addresses. Wasn't electrum the most trusted bitcoin software wallet?
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:44:56

What are his predictions for a bottom price and when a  bull run might start?
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:48:13
I like them.  They actually let you withdraw bitcoin, unlike a bunch of other pseudo-investment apps. (crumbs, circle, robinhood, etc)
