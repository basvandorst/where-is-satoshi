I'm in a similar boat, they didn't fulfill my amazon gift card order but they took my bitcoin for it and I can't get a response from anybody at BitPay about getting a refund or the gift card

BitPay is having all kinds of issues across the board, and if you experience one of them, don't bother trying to reach customer support. For me, I bought an amazon gift card for almost $1,000, BitPay took the bitcoins, but failed to apply the gift card to my account. This was TWO WEEKS AGO and there is still absolutely zero response from BitPay. And these GitHub issues show this is happening to many people

BitPay can't even get the core functionality of their app right, not surprised they can't implement something like Segwit

Here's just a couple _big_ problems their customers are reporting (and not getting ANY response about) 
* Amazon gif card scam they have going (taking bitcoins, not fulfilling gift cards)
* Charging double fees for transactions and not issuing refunds for failed transactions in their app.
* No response from customer support at BitPay regarding any of the ripped-off customers

It doesn't help that they all but ignore any of their customers who need support or help from them. BitPay going down in flames would be so satisfying for so many people who have been screwed by BitPay.

There are better reasons to dump BitPay, like total lack of customer support if you run into any type of problem with their service. I mean their [ twitter account hasn't even been active in over 1 month, and help yields the exact same response.

So what are you going to eat when it gets past 20k?

On top of the amazon gift card "scam" they have going on with no support staff

If you ever do use BitPay I hope you never run into any problems because if you do and you need customer support, you won't get any. They took almost $1,000 in bitcoin from me over 3 weeks ago for an amazon gift card, I never got the gift card, but they got the bitcoin - and I can't get a response from anybody through official support channels or public

I wouldn't touch BitPay, with all the issues they're having, then on top of it, absolutely ZERO support from their customer service team, not even a reply saying "Please wait 2 weeks for any type of help"...  because thats how long you'll be waiting, AT LEAST 2 weeks.

I'd avoid BitPay at all costs
