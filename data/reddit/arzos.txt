What is there not to understand about the contradictory notion of using the state to achieve liberty versus actually allowing liberty to run its course.

mining can be profitable, but often it has been much more cost and time effective in many cases through bitcoin's past to simply just buy bitcoin rather than putting the money into mining hardware. This is the dilemma many should consider when entering into any mining investment.
However the Bitclub takes it one step further (worse), where a major portion of what the hardware mines goes into paying everyone who entered before you in this multi level marketing scheme. 
If you are looking for strictly fiat denominated gains it may be okay, however in this sense it relies on Bitcoins price going up and you would still be better off having bought bitcoin at a lower price in that scenario. You will not have a return on investment nearly as fast as you would for an alternative mining investment unless you "promote" the investment to people to come in under you.
It is my opinion as well as many other prominent members of the bitcoin community that the Bitclub is an inferior investment, and some would go as far as saying it is even predatory in nature to the many people unfamiliar with the bitcoin space.

Hydropower is superior. I have contacts to acquire existing power plants if anyone wants to buy or finance for 4-5 million dollars per MW. Turns out to be effectively 2.3-2.8 cents per kWh for a long term loan. Definately worth it if you are a true believer in the deflationary principles of crypto, alas I do not have the assets necessary to secure such a loan though I have someone who would offer it for only 3% annual interest. Could be quite a boon even after one boom bust cycle we've witnessed before

Bitclub was founded by Joby Weeks, check out his youtube. Clearly an MLM where you will likely never get a btc denominated ROI and the only ones making money are the "residual miners" skimming from the top. A pyramid scheme fits the bill if you ask me

Its very possible mining will not return the cash that could have been spent in Bitcoin in the present. It all depends on the price. Generally if the price continues to increase it will have been better to just buy the coins. Maybe I would suggest buying coins and only investing in mining if you can catch a period where Bitcoin is relatively over valued.
@_date: 2016-05-14 04:16:28
you would think that money is better spent paying dividends to the people who will already lose out on their opportunity cost being siphoned by "residual miners"

uhm, from where do the winnings come if there is no house edge?? no fees, sure but..
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:31:31
no, you are simply ignoring statistics, nor do you give evidence to your assertion it WILL be profitable. anyone at any time that has more than the house to start or is lucky enough to reach a large btc position over the house on their initial bets can siphon off the house bank roll at statistically little risk to themselves. 
If you are familiar with martingale, you must acknowledge that the entity (whether the person or the house) that has a larger bank roll will have the advantage. I doubt this casino will be the largest  holder of btc at its inception, nor larger than a syndicate of people that may want to game it down too
a zero sum game is by definition neutral profit statistically, so you are not making any money while exposing yourself to be gamed by whales or hacked
also, lets just say this can work, you are promoting gambling addictions to support this scheme

this assumes there is a counter bet for every single bet. sure it can work, but i highly doubt it will automagically line up like that. it would severely limit the number of games that can be played. It would have to be done in where people post their bets and other people take them or not, might work fine, could even be decentralized
you could certainly institute a house investor role like many sites have already done. but no one would "invest" in a zero sum game, because its not investing, its just straight gambling

the majority of people gamble responsibly, losing on average the house edge. your assertion is simply false. you can find data of house profit of various online casinos, and they all generally increase at the average rate of their house edge
here are a few data sets:
the studies generally show that house income is around 80% from 10% of the gamblers, not including non-betting services. Can additional services put the casino into the black? sure, they can always try
A zero sum game will eventually reach a point where low house bankroll is susceptible to whales quitting while they're ahead because there is statistically neutral house profit. Its the law of large numbers

statistical variance will inevitably break the house, without a house edge there is no buffer to be built to prevent this and the chance of it happening will never decrease for the entire life of the casino
if the house bank roll is at zero, its not fair because you could bet without potential winnings being available

I believe i saw it in the coindesk article;
With Chileans having a much more libertarian gov, i think the regulation side is at least better than alternatives.

which leads me to believe there is definitely forward thinking in regards to regulations

Easy way to solve this is have network transaction fee come out of house's profit(would require minimum wager amounts.
