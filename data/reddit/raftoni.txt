Somebody bought in differents webs with my card with an IP in a different continent where i was, i put the demnad and the claim and the bank ignore it, they said was my fault for give my card data to somebody else, but i didnt, i dont know how the robbers got it.
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:04:39
Read again, you say somebody steal your money, i said it happens to me, give your your email and i will send you the claim i put and the answer of the bank, somebody stole my money i dont know how using my card and the bank said you should not give your card data to other people. This happens a lot, check in the internet

Yes but good luck with that, happened to me 3 years a go and i still waiting to get my money back and there are by far more possibilities to get your bank account stolen than your btc cold wallet

@_date: 2018-08-07 16:27:09
Haha come on say something with an argument at least, if you dont need it just ignore it, go  and ask somebody from Venezuela, Argentina, Nigeria to see what they say, ive been using it for year to send remittances to my family and friends in poor countries that without btc would be impossible and buying properties and receiving payments from abroad, so some value it must have, no?
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:48:28
Well most of the time you will recover you money for sure, but how long it took? my bank was BBVA. Dont you think is better to use payment methods which less risk to get your data stolen? Even paypal is better than banks

Ive worked for e-comerce companies and i can tell you that the credit cards fraud cost millions of dollars every day for this companies, banks and credit cards owners (there are fraud departments even). in the other hand yes now we have the contactless payments but in europe the credit cards falsifications still being millions Euros every year, small business still using chips.

Pls can you give me arguments? Can you quote some of the 10 points and give me an alternative or better way to do it? A better way to send remittances to Venezuela, to protect nations againts bad politics of the governments (5), give an alternative to bank the unbanked and access to international markets in Africa poor countries (10)?

@_date: 2019-03-20 10:13:51
 In Venezuela cash is scarce, Its very hard to find Bolivars bills, some people even sell cash for 2-3 times the value of the bill, Dolar bills are not easy to find there, most of the people dont have access to them, and most of the dollar bills circulating there are fake as there Bolivars has no value the paper is used to counterfeit dollar bills.

The telecommunications companies have plants with batteries that allow them to continue broadcasting the signal for the internet for a few hours after running out of electricity, just as your cell phone has a battery and still works even if it is not directly connected to electricity. My family lives there in Venezuela and I was able to communicate with them through whatsapps until about 10 hours after the power outage, during this time I paid to a supplier on the black market of non-perishable food directly to his  btc wallet, so i was sure that my family had food during the time they were without electricity, normally i send remittances every month to them via Bitcoin, tell how can i do that with gold? Also You can find several stores in Venezuela that accepts Btc but my family have never found one that accepts physical gold, so what are you saying?

Yes it matter because during this 10 hours they were trying to buy non perishable food and they could not find any supermarket open and the few places opened were receiving only cash, cause TPVs run with electricity and the cash is very scarce and hard to find there, and they dont have dollar bills that was the other possibilitie, so they found some kind of blackmarket guy that sold them the food (very expensive btw) and i pay using bitcoins from Spain directly to the wallet of the guy.

In the case they have that % of hashrate the network will continue working normally with the exception that a 51% attack would be 70% cheaper, but is nothing to worry because that would be levels of 2/3 years a go, and before that the hashrate of the network was a couple hundred times below that and nothing happened

Also cars produce a lot of contamination and instead of stop using them and go back to Horses, tecnology invents electric cars, for Malthus the overpopulation should had extinted the whole populations a few centuries back, but instead, the tecnology improves the productivity of the food production more then population grows, banks also consume tons of electricity every day millions of offices open every day are consuming tons of electricity, the electricity used for Bitcoin mining is something we are paying for having a descentraliced, inmutable device to move value with freedom around the world, so whats the problem if we are paying this electricity? dont you thing in a future we will be able to mine Bitcoins with a tecnology that elevates exponencially the efficiency of electricty consuming?

Im Venezuelan, my family still living there, is true a lot of people is too poor to have internet conection or smartphones but there are a lot of people that is living better than the average because they have been protecting themselves from the inflation using bitcoin since years a go, i even buy food for my family from the abroad paying with btc to a company that delivers the food to their house. the government wanted to keep part of the remittances money sent by Venezuelans abroad and could not because people sent the money via bitcoin. When you don’t have argument you just have to use words like “moron”, “bastard” etc so smart ��

Im saying that bitcoin doesnt depend on one country, if im in Spain for example and half of the rest of the countries of the world have an electricity cut, i can still use my bitcoins in Spain with electricity, but the last two days people in Spain and the rest of the world could not perform Petros transaction because Venezuela was without electricity.
@_date: 2018-10-27 19:32:21
They use use it more then you think, check the localbitcoins daily volumes in this countries, i also have some familiars and friends there that already sold properties in bitcoins and i normally send  money every month to my family living there via btc ��

Thanks for this, i was just giving and example cause a lot of people that don't have any idea how the market works are always crying because they bought at all time high. This post is for this people that doesnt take the time to research or because of their IQ they need something easy to invest and not be worry for the price all the time or simply for people that don't have money to invest at one time and only want to put for example 5% of their salary ever month in bitcoin. For example i've been dollar cost averaging a % of my salary in Bitcoin in the last 4 years, using it as my savings for retire plan. Of course sometimes when there are  stupid FUD in the news an it falls 5-10% in a day i alway buy more in those especific times, this has made me beat the DCA strategy.

I'm a Venezuelan that suffered the economic policy of a dictatorship regime with capital Control, Hiperinflation, govertmment constantly debasing my money and risk of bank account freezing whenever they want as they control the whole banking system. Btc allowed me to left the country with my life savings without confiscation risk on the boarders and i can send remittances to my family without asking permission to the regime or they taking a slice of it. Bitcoin does not arbitrarily  block your transaction because you are in the wrong country, isnt this an usecase? Also bitcoin doesnt need to recruit people, sound money will always do what sound money does. I have been upgrading to Bitcoin % of my salary every month  for more than 5 years and i have never sold a single satoshi and not planing to sell never for inflationary fiat money.

BTC price 2.5 years a go (April 2017) = 1070

Just have to apply the dollar cost averaging strategy for at least 1 year and you will always be green. No one who has done it for more than a year has lost money.

"economist"? A true economist that undertood the austrian economists like Hayek, Von Misses etc, is imposible that can not be a Bitcoin Maximalist ��

Yeah or don't, if he has to ask this kind of questions here and don't know the difference between centralized shitcoins like ether and Bitcoin, maybe its not for him yet.

You got scammed because you are looking for a get rich quick scheme, get a job in the internet and ask to get paid in Btc, thats a good start.

Hi im an Economist from Venezuela living in Europa and i use Bitcoin to send Remittances to my Family living in Venezuela and to protect my capital from economic policy of the governments, decentralization is important for me ��
@_date: 2018-11-01 07:11:19
sending remittances to my family living in Venezuela, thus preventing the government from controlling and stealing a commission from what I send them, allowing them to buy goods and services, besides keeping money immune to hyperinflation

Ask Venezuelans, Argentinians, Nigerians or Chineses and you will see of that it has a lot of value to them, the world is bigger than your city and your neighborhood, the fact that you find something useless doesnt mean it can not be very helpful to a lot of people. From my experience i prefer not to trust and put my life in the hand of a central bank/goverment. The fact that you can trust the economic policy of your government now doesnt mean everybody can or it can not change in the future.

There you can find where to spend them but mainly on services and products not so much on a daily basis,  as car parts, subscriptions, dentistry and many people sell their cars and apartments in bitcoins before leaving the country. For example, I have a fixed supplier of imported basic products and I pay directly in bitcoins because we have agreed and he deliver the products to my mother's house, the rest of the btc I normally send, my family exchanges them for bolivares through localbitcoins.com when they need to shop
@_date: 2018-11-06 07:40:43
The same than gold, bitcoin is the digital gold, by the way ask Venezuelans, Argentinians, Nigerian or Chinesse what they think about it. They are not criminals just people that found a way to protect their capital from the economic policy of shitty governments

I can not see zero in the value, i just sent remittances via Bitcoin to my family in Vzla yesterday and it worked for them, post this and say you are in the winning side when the value is Zero as you said

USA current stock market contraction and crash expected for next year (big capital could try alternatives to invest or protect their money) Brexit and the consequent European Crisis, lack of confidence in central banks (Venezuela, Argentina, Nigeria etc) and federal reserve printing more and more money, the transition to the world economic power of the next generation (more digital one) replacing the old and antique one, the rise of price after the 2020 halving, use cases and people finding it better than gold as a store of value and way to move big amounts of money overseas, etc etc, all these and more reason could make the demand of bitcoin rise in the next years ;-)

Maybe the problem is to transfer usd why dont you Buy btc and withdrawal the btc to another wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:59:28
That only confirm im correct! You were a Shitcoiner! Shitcoins like Bcash only are soaring now because Bitcoin is, and there are still a lot of people like you that doesnt understand Bitcoin and are going to get Rekt sooner or later, in the long run sound money will always surge and the ones that will lost are the lastest to start using it.
@_date: 2019-05-04 07:09:52
The temptation for central bank to abuse of printing money is too big and has always created recesions, the video describe how economics work now and how the recesions have been created for abuse of printing money and how Keynesians try to solve it printing more money ��, the video is not how it should be. research directly from the sources, read economist like Hayek, Von Mises, research about the "belle epoque" when the world was under the Gold Standard and how the economics worked when sound money was the rule.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:40:28
You clearly have no idea of what Bitcoin is �� enjoy your inflationary fiat currency controlled by the govertnment, good luck with that, in the long term you will understand

Im not into Crypto, i only use Bitcoin, and i don't have any other alternatives to send remittances to my family there and neither my friends to protect their capital from the Maduro's Regime, bitcoin is the most secure network in the world (10 years without been hacked once and hash power soaring) if you use it right and dont keep your coins in exchanges or third Parties.
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:33:40
Not inmutable, pre mined, marketing team, Ceo, centralized, inflationary, etc

After checking your history now i undestand that you were a Shitcoiner that got rekt ���� thats what happen when you are just looking for get rich quick schemes and don't research why you just only had to buy Bitcoin and avoid the shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:57:51
I agree that Cryptos (shitcoins) are worst, but Bitcoin have nothing to do with the rest, the rest of the Cryptos are shitcoins, Bitcoin is the only one Descentraliced, inmutable, self-sustainable and  "Bitcoin is the first scarce digital object the world has ever seen, it is more scarce than gold and can be sent over the internet, radio, satellite etc."
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:12:00
I'm a Venezuelan living in the abroad that suffered the economic policy of a shitty govertnment, i've been sending remittances to my family there via Bitcoin for more than 5 years, my family and friends have been protecting their capital from the govertnment using Bitcoin, several of them were able to sell their properties in Bitcoin and take their capital out of the country without the regimen confiscate their own money, etc etc, and you think Bitcoin is worthless and i'm just a Crypto fan? ����‍♂️

Bitcoin doesn't have a CEO...other coins depend of the image or desitions of a few people. The economic policy of BTC is predictable and can't be changed by nobody. The rest of the coins are centralised shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:11:29
All the forkes eventually will disappear, all of them now are shitcoins with CEOs and marketing team, this shitcoins dont represent even a considerable % of Bitcoin Market cap and neither hash power, "they will probably change", who is gonna change Bitcoin supply? Neither miners could in 2012 in the first halvening with millions of time less hash power. You have spent much time with Keynesians man, read the Austrians economist like Hayek, Inflation is not a good thing!! It is just give much control to govertnments to steal your money silently.
