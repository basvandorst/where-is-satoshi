I don't like the thought that when my nan forgets her email password again and has one of my cousins set up a new one, she's asked to pay with a technology she doesn't know in order to email me. Email is beautifully convenient it makes no sense to put something in the way. I always recommend having 2 accounts, one you actually use, and the other for signing up to things. I only check my spam email account when I need a password reset or see an order I placed. I still get spam of course but I'd rather delete a few spam messages myself than selfishly demanding everyone new has to pay me before I'll bother reading their email.
Spam isn't so annoying as to want me to avoid possible genuine opportunities.
That's obviously just me and my opinion and I'm not pretending it's a majority or significant view. Good luck but I'm out.

Change manipulated to stabilised.
And the end result of cash and bitcoin is the same. I have something of value whether cash or bitcoin and exchange it for something else of value.
I can use cash - zero transfer charges, no third party involvement. Or I can use Bitcoin which has a transfer charge but also no real third party involvement, except the miners which I'm relying on for confirmation of the transaction which could take minutes or... actually cash in a face to face transaction is far more convenient.

Bitcoin transactions are public, addresses are pretty anonymous but not strictly so. 
I have an address, and I had to top up my bitcointip address in order to send that 1 mbtc back (due to transfer "charges").
Jesset knowing his bitcointip address can now find my bitcointip address. From that (s)he'll be able to see my personal Bitcoin address.
From that address, Jesset can see how many Bitcoins I have on that address and see other addresses I've sent and received from.
If other clumsy people like me can be traced to these addresses, someone could build a bit of a portfolio on me.
Given that I haven't been particularly privacy concious, feel free to investigate me and PM the results for confirmation/rebuttal. I have the theory and I'd be interested to know just how much can be discovered.
Credit card and Paypal yes, the information is known by your CC and PP companies, but no footprint of past transactions is given out when you buy. Yes individual companies can track PP and CC details (and probably do to track purchase history). This should make a CC transaction more secure if indeed you weren't handing over the equivalent to a private BTC key in order to buy something.
Don't get me wrong, I LOVE bitcoin! and will continue supporting and using it! But I feel the public ledger doesn't offer as much privacy as it first seems. If (when?) Bitcoin goes mainstream, marketing agencies could use the ledger for targeted advertising and buyer tracking quite easily. It's like a public database of all credit card numbers ready for harvesting by the right people.

I think that's a debate as old as time, we certainly won't solve it here. Also after posting I did realise the issue goes beyond the title although OP's title carries on a theme, and that was my main criticism.
Certainly there are women (and men) proud to have their bodies on show for the enjoyment of others. Those we'll throw out straight away because that's clear cut, no issue I'm sure.


That's a hard one to judge, the photographer chose what to shoot and could have easily been biassed. However the employer chose what was available to shoot in the first place and is subject to the same ideas.


This is quite probable even with the debates above. I don't agree that it's right, but that's not something we can do much about either, but it is probable.
My main objection was that there was a company/business/individual giving away Bitcoin. OP rightly felt that would be interested. We obviously are, look at these offtopic debates! But as a promotion about Bitcoin on the Bitcoin subreddit, the chosen headline begins with:
* Hot: Attractive, eye candy
* Asian: Asian... totally irrelevant as Asia is such a huge continent, people from Cyprus are classed as Asians, as are Afghani women and Chinese, Hong... Kongians etc.
* Chicks: A colloquial term for the female human being, often found offensive by people it refers to.
Oh... free Bitcoins in Hong Kong, now that's the story I want to hear about.
I love Reddit, childishness is generally downvoted with intelligent comments and arguments up top. Makes a huge change from the keyboard headbutters on other news site comment pages! I was disappointed that a good article was given such a poor headline.

When I last installed a PC client, it had to sync with the blockchain and ran over night until the next morning. I have a reasonably well powered machine on one of Virgin Media's faster home broadband lines.
As the blockchain gets larger all the time basing a calculation on one's current "funds" on the whole blockchain rather than just the balance. How will Bitcoin adapt to avoid the need for centralised databases.
A more stupid question:
I understand how new blocks need to be verified, is there any system checking and preventing edits to blocks long confirmed? I assume there is, how does it maintain the history without reconfirming every block.

The left hand side is enforced regulation required by law. Western Union have a responsibility to protect itself from fraud and protect its clients. Money sent to the wrong person could be stopped, money not claimed could be returned. Money sent can only be claimed by the person you sent it to or returned and cannot be claimed by anyone else.
Bitcoin is free (as in market) but unregulated, send it to the wrong person, tough. Send it to an empty unclaimed wallet, tough, someone manages to intercept it somehow, tough, person loses their private key after you sent it, tough. Much easier to lose Bitcoin and there is nobody there to help you get it back.
If Western Union didn't care about your money and didn't have to follow international laws, I'm sure their send system would be much quicker. So I don't think this comparison is a fair one. And I love Bitcoin, but we've got to be realistic over the benefits of a heavily regulated fiat currency.

Bitcoin is more commonly compared to cash. Now if I have 82k or 82million in cash and I hand it to someone else, it's completely free. Bitcoin charges :(
Now banks by protecting my money might make a charge (although bacs transfer is also usually free unlike Bitcoin). Likewise if you decided to use a bank to protect your bitcoin (and they offered such a service) or deposit paper wallets into a vault they will protect your security by asking questions to prove identity and protect themselves from be in scammed.
It's just another BS "comparison"

It would be easy to enforce as the entity behind Bitcoin is nowhere to be found.... Bitcoin at the moment is just a non-word with no legal standing.

Bitcoin is like cash. Cold hard cash works in the same way.
A bank isn't cash, a bank is a place to store your cash to keep it safe.
Coinbase in that base level is therefore a bank. They take their transaction fees and presumably profit not unfairly from abandoned accounts.
You cannot compare banks to bitcoin, you should compare banks to Coinbase (and other similar setups). You can only fairly compare bitcoin to cash whereby the biggest benefit is distance transmission which cannot be done easily or safely with cash.
A bonefide bank could allow bitcoin deposits, storage, withdrawals and even loans and mortgages! The two are not mutually exclusive.

At first I was mad, then I realised you didn't deposit cash, you deposited a cheque, which is a forgeable IOU from your side, but could bounce if the sender doesn't have the funds their side. After presenting a cheque, the bank are trying to protect both parties interests with such a weak document. If the person sent cash or bacs (best example of how Bitcoin works) you would have had all of it instantly (quicker than Bitcoin most of the time)
If someone gave you an IOU for bitcoin, there would be noone looking out for your interests, you'd get no Bitcoin up front to spend and there's a much higher chance of you getting scammed.
So far, for cheques as little more than an IOU document, having a centralised system trying to protect both parties in the transaction, banks with their fiat win.

It doesn't have to be an exclusive club, there are many open clubs you can join who allow you to punch anyone in the face for free. By joining the club, you get extra protection including the power to re aim your punch if you miss the first time. Without a club, a missed punch is missed and gone for good. The club also work to protect the strength of that punch, if your punch is beginning to weaken, they put steps in place to help restrengthen it. Again without a club, your punch could become super strong, or super weak. A weak punch in the wrong direction is again lost forever. A club would help withdraw that punch, strengthen it up and repunch it.

The reason is really that I don't have the skills or time to sit down and trace your transactions properly. But addresses and address patterns can be traced and in theory, certainly with wider bitcoin adoption, it should be quite easy to trace some accounts in this way.
The "feel free to investigate me" was aimed more at the general public than you directly. I don't have anything to hide, but I've also been lax on security so would be interested to know what someone could dig up.

In a transaction, both sides need to prove they fulfilled their end of the bargain. 
The buyer using Paypal leaves an easy to follow paper trail (if they used cash or another method, they would have to find another way to prove they paid)
The seller then needs to prove they fulfilled their side of the deal, and it's up to them to keep shipping receipts etc.
If the item is lost by the postal service, the contract is between the seller and the postal company, so the seller should get their money back from the postal service, the buyer gets their money back from the seller.
Always go for signed for or insured postage, keep a proper papertrail so you can prove you did the right thing.
Then when Paypal mention a dispute, you can show your side and win easily.
Lazy sellers get caught out.

Yes yes yes yes and no. And that's touched on one difficulty with Bitcoin. If the banks mess it up (again), they and the government will work to re establish the value of the currency and order is restored. The government didn't bail out the banks so much as ensure savers and homeowners didn't lose out after the banks messed up. If a bank goes under and owns your house, your house is potentially on the line for repayment of their debts. But the practice of that is complicated and whether Im strictly correct but that part is less important in this discussion. 
If bitcoin value falls due to whatever, there is no one there to protect it. Businesses switch back to fiat, and bitcoin owners own little more than a worthless peice of history.
I'm not saying that will ever happen, I believe bitcoin will last for a long time. But its future is never certain. Currency backed by a country and banks with a close eye kept on interest and inflation generally stay alive (with few exceptions)

Not at all, if banks start dealing with Bitcoin, which they would long before this question is ever a real one, they can happily stay afloat. People will still need loans and mortgages, and while these would work in a different way to current banking, it's completely compatible with the banking system. Coinbase is effectively a bank, as is any website or company willing to hold on to your Bitcoin for you. 
Banks and Bitcoin are not mutually exclusive. Banks do not need fiat, they just need currency of value to safekeep and loan.

The independent banks would start buying each other out forming larger and larger corporations, eventually Governments would apply the same regulations to Bitcoin as they do Fiat and form or move a central bank onto it. There's no reason why central banks couldn't adapt and stay totally alive. 
What they wouldn't be able to do is create money from nothing... and even then by the law of supply and demand (people like money from nothing) they would find a way around it. Probably in the form of paper bonds, something which can be exchanged because it has a value offset against the value of Bitcoin in the bank's cold storage vaults, and perhaps would say "I promise to pay the bearer..." or something similar on it...

A Bitcoin ATM opened here in Swansea a few months ago, it made some press, I found out about it following Bitcoin previously.
On launch, about 10 people attended, 2 from the suppliers, 2 from the cafe it opened in, and a couple of enthusiasts.
Not many were drinking coffee.
The Bitcoin ATM is no longer there.
I don't know what the outlay/rental is like, but don't expect too much footfall. Enthusiasts will shop for the best deal which ATMs generally can't provide due to overheads, most people are still not interested.

With your explanation, those actions make much more sense.
Bitcoin is unique because with nobody behind it, there is nobody to protect it. It's also not tied to a country and can be easily replaced.
If a flaw were found today, people would move onto bitcoin 2.0 or whatever label it may exist under, money would be lost but only in the same way it was gained. If it turns out to be as solid as we believe maybe it will last, but be aware of alternate currencies with better coding, self-cleaning block chain, or even better marketing because as with all new technologies, new currencies will emerge which won't rival bitcoin, but rather would render bitcoin obsolete.

I try one address per week.... but I can try many combinations per hour, and as computing power increases, so do my chances of a collision. The best bit is I'm not paying $2 per attempt, this cost prevents people buying 13 billion tickets! but doesn't stop me generating 13 billion private keys.
As computing power increases, is it logical to say that today's private keys could be broken within a reasonable timescale.

The trouble I think is that the day someone finds a collision, any BTC they're able to steal will devalue too quickly to be worthwhile.

100 real pennies will always cost $1 because they are two measures of the same thing, in this case "value"
[100 pennies actually costs $1.40 to produce]( the plastic pennies will cost far less.
When you buy plastic pennies, you're buying from a profit making company who have a mark-up. When you buy 100 pennies from a bank with no markup, you only pay for what they're worth. If banks could markup a transfer (which some do depending on what and how you're trying to obtain the pennies), you could end up paying more.
Finally, once bought, your real penny can be exchanged again for a penny. Your plastic penny loses value very quickly.
Ultimately it's a poor comparison.

One of the most attractive qualities of bitcoin is that although the ledger is public, the owner of a wallet is completely anonymous.
I think time spent on this is already too much, it's going to be very hard to get caught out, and harder still to launch an evidence trail big enough to get a prosecution or forfeiture.
It's definitely fascinating but perhaps leaves a little too much hope.

How can we tell the difference? And how do we know a real world transaction hasn't already taken place? The thief could have already sold the coins or even sold on the private key. There is so little identifying the thief that he'd have so many defences if ever caught

Resource: "a stock or supply of money, materials, staff, and other assets that can be drawn on by a person or organization in order to function effectively."
By this definition, it could be seen as a resource, however it certainly doesn't exist in nature like Gold, Diamonds and other "precious" materials. More to the point, if people stop trading Gold, Gold would still exist. Bitcoin could one day simply disappear being at it's core just a set of rules for manipulating numbers. Can a set of rules be a resource?

If the concept is true (and as it's not backed up with facts and figures may or may not be) that is still only based on current knowledge and technology. I used to have an 8mhz 386 PC which used the same power input/output as a basic quad core gaming machine does today. By getting exponentially more computing power using less energy, I'm not saying it is realistic, but it's not beyond the realms of possibility that collisions could be orchestrated. A long way off solving a target address, but if your only goal is a collision, it's a damn sight easier.
Also you don't have to count all the way up to 2^256, because once you'd gotten half way, you would have theoretically collided with half of all known bitcoin addresses. You only need to count all the way to leave no address uncollided.
Today, this is not an issue, and tomorrow Bitcoin will simply be adapted or replaced to accommodate the new technology so it will always be a non-issue. But is it possible that one day a single PC will have enough power to cause collisions if the underlying code remains completely unchanged from today?

While I don't agree with it in the slightest, criminalising encryption and crypto gives powers of arrest against anyone using them.

Looking LONG long term for Bitcoin.
The number of potential private keys is HUGE but finite. So as Bitcoin adoption increases, so does the chance of collision. If wallet generation went on unimpeded at today's rate, how long until the chance of a collision is 50%? (i.e. 50% of all Bitcoin addresses used)
Computers and processors are getting better all the time. How powerful would a processor need to be to deliberately collide with a wallet with at least 10BTC within 6 months?
If the hardware is available, is Bitcoin mining always going to be more efficient at creating income than Bitcoin theft or will Bitcoin need to be replaced at some point in the future??
The probability argument against collisions does worry me slightly. The chance is minute, but it can happen. Rather than locking your current wealth in a bank account where it always "exists" and cannot be stolen without a hack and audit trail, Bitcoin wallets seem to be more craftily hidden behind a loose brick in a wall, it's very unlikely someone will find it, but it could happen and if they do, you're screwed.
I suppose that's the strength of running multiple wallets for damage limitation.

It is risky rather than dangerous. Cycling without a helmet is dangerous because it has either a bad or neutral outcome. Risk allows for positive gains which so far Bitcoin has proven. However, bitcoin only has value because people give it value. There is nobody to regulate the value of Bitcoin while there are banks keeping an eye on GBP and USD. This allows the spikes and troughs which Bitcoin is demonstrating. And if tomorrow people stop giving it value... it will disappear. Nobody is there to catch it. Risky yes, dangerous no.




This is subjective, as I don't know who *you* are, I couldn't judge. If you are a normal person with a little (or lot) to spare, go ahead. If you struggle to make ends meet and put your life savings into it, the risk of losing it all is probably too high.

Which as the darknet markets would presumably continue using them would keep Bitcoin going until any future uprising or death. Remember it was the closure of Silk Road which got Bitcoin into the papers to start with and turned £50 into £1000 in a matter of weeks and even then 1 BTC was about £80 mostly from black market trade perhaps, this we can only assume. If it went back to that state, it would easily fly back out, just like it did this year.


Deleting the private key effectively makes the BTC near impossible to access, however the Bitcoin will still exist outside of that key. Like a locked box of money, throw away the key and the box doesn't just disappear.
Theoretically, if someone generated the same keypair, the bitcoin could be accessed again. Yes this is so unlikely that it is damn near impossible, and certainly not a task worth trying, however because it is even remotely possible, proves that Bitcoin are not destroyed, just untradable.

The trouble with money, particularly one like Bitcoin is that the data is split up into events and activities. The first months of Bitcoin don't bare any relation to Bitcoin's drop on the SR seizure. Rather than having 4 years of data in one block, we actually have 4 years of incomplete segments.
Secondly graphs like these are better for trends and patterns. With Bitcoin's current advancement, the value is far too volatile to make projections. Split the data by day, month, year or date and each graph will point in a different direction.

That would be unenforceable and therefore a complete waste of legislature. Some drugs are illegal and that actually puts prices up!
Also a person doesn't own cryptocurrency like one would own a mobile phone. I don't own my few bitcoins. I own a private key which allows me to see bitcoins which people have assigned to me, they exist on every BTC ledger on the Internet, I can re-assign them or keep them. I cannot delete them if they are made illegal, I cannot burn them or put them into a bin. How can the government make owning them illegal if I have no way of disposing of them? In order for them to remove Bitcoin from my possession, they would have to make it illegal to have a private key stored somewhere on any storage device. This isn't like looking for illegal porn, a private key isn't labelled "Bitcoin key". It is just a string of random characters, quite literally.
Back to enforceability, if you have something worth $1000 and the government suddenly made it illegal.... but other governments haven't (keeping its value). Would you delete it if you could?


Bitcoin is worldwide, shut it down in the US, and it will be confirmed by computers in UK, shut that down, it will go to Norway. The network will be there unless every one shuts down at once. Shutting down the Bitcoin network would be like shutting down the Internet. There is no central computer you can just switch off. You only need a handful of miners online somewhere in the world to keep the network going.


not at all, [Richard Branson accepts Bitcoin for Virgin Galactic]( you can buy [pizza]( buy coffee from [vending machines]( and [much much more](
Yes there are people who use Bitcoin to buy drugs, the same people also use cash, but cash is still going strong.
I stand my case, It would be near impossible to make Bitcoin and Bitcoin trade illegal, or if they did find a way, it would be impossible to enforce it. Piratebay is centralised, it exists on servers and is run by people and no government has even been able to shut that down! If anything it's stronger than ever. And if they can't stop that, how can they stop Bitcoin?
Bitcoin will die a death one day I'm sure, but it will not be killed by law any time soon.
I would also consider finding a way of voicing opinions of other people's comments without resulting to personal insults. Back it up with evidence, but calling someone blind and their opinions 'flawed' without backing just comes across a little rude. You're allowed to disagree, and I am allowed my opinion and both of us have a right to hold or change that opinion without the name calling.
