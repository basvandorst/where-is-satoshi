Damn. You are legitimately rustle. Let's go at it one more time. The 250$ was +-8600. After shoping around I got 1.0605 while the real value was 1.0927. Tell me how you can get better I would gladly take the advice - no matter how arrogant you are. About the 4$ yeah indeed that's pretty fuked up. Now, there is a reason why other then your arrogant "bad at banking" argument. I am someone that shop around for each service. I got my morgage with TD, got my house credit line with RBC, got my sutdent loan with BNC and I hole most of my fund with Tangerine (no fees! yeah!). The only account I'm paying is BNC because they ask me a minimum of 5k - fuk them. This follow the next argument which is NO it's not cash in my account. As I stated before I'm not a retard and I wouldn't hold 15 grand in my bank account. I use it mainly to trade. Lastly, "crap salary" well other then it's real fuking subjective (50k in montreal vs 50k in vancouver is totally different) I actually have a single income because I provide for my wife to study full time. Sickness was a bad example of why you need money at your disposal. My dad recently found out that his house foundation was bad and it cost him 25k. If you want to keep the discussion going change the tone to something more civic or I just won't bother answering.

It won't go to 0. Alt coins will grow, just like bitcoins will grow. You are just impatient. Bitcoin is the leader and the "most stable". When alt coins move they move very very quick. I think that after a couple of hard months (china+mtgox) the public opinion about crypto is going back to what it was and I wouldn't be suprised to see btc/alts grow quickly in the next months! I don't think it was wise to sell all.

First 4 months profit for RBC Canada? 2.06 billion dollars! I got nothing agains't people who makes legitimate money with a good service. But they just shove those fees down our throat with a shit tier service.

For the moon I got my dogecoins ;). Yeah I def. know it's a risk. But it's a risk I'm willing to take. I wouldn't do the same move at 60 thought.

I do business in US but my day to day transaction are in CAD. Each time I convert my money earned (US) to CAD I get fucked. I can't connect paypal to my US account because of the canadian law. I just paid  250$ in conversion fees. the 250$ is not the difference between US and CAD, it's the simple cut they are taking on the real value. 4$/month for the past 10 years  = (480$ without counting the extra). Justify wire transfer... I guess you've never done that. You need to put a reason when you send money, the bank gives itself the right to know that. 15k cashflow? Cuz I'm not a retard? I have a house and 10k can disapear in a matter of weeks if something goes wrong. It can be sickness, accident, fire etc. I have 2-3 months of salary how is that wrong?

If they really "legalize" (whatever that means) bitcoins as a currency, that means that if bitcoins gain 10x value I won't have to pay taxes when converting back my coins to CAD (why would I ever do that lol). Sweet. Now gotta stop beleiving first post I read and actually read the law.

Do you have an update for us?

Is it taxable above a certain amount? Like when we do small business we don't have to charge taxes when it's below 30k. I made like only 2000$ with bitcoins. Is it really worth my time to declare it?

Still wondering if you're trolling me or if you actually ... legitimately find it logic. I'm sure that the fact that my account got below 5k made some people work very very hard.

It's mostly ebay. I buy lots of stuff there. Paypal is a total scam for conversion. I can't link my US account to paypal because you can only link an account with the currency of your country.

I don't understand how you end up on ? Do you really navigate subreddit to hate on people?

Before selling my US for CAD I checked with a Forex broker. "50K for a programmer this is doing international contracts" what the fuck are you talking about lol?! I'm not a programmer that does "international contracts" you know jack shit about my life. The average salary for someone that finish software engineer is 55k. Anyway you should really take a deep breath and chill out. Not only are you insulting me for no reason but you're talking out of your ass. I'll have to put an end to this exchange because I'm wasting my time. GL rustling.
