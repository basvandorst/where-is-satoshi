Hmmm, sounds like an unfortunate miscommunication. Apologies for that.
We do not tie software updates to your subscription. Once you have a node, it'll still be able to receive any updates we release for that version of the node / you'll get them regardless of your subscription being current or not.

Agree it can be made more clear, will work on that...
Worth mentioning that as we release newer versions of the node hardware, software updates for that node may not be included in updates for the OLDER nodes. For example, we’re not going to release updates for an old node with features that only the newer node can run. (Not everything will be backward compatible.) Current subscribers on latest node hardware will get all updates. Those with older nodes would get things like security updates, major bug fixes, etc. etc. - regardless of whether you’re a current subscriber or not.
Hope that makes more sense?

Curious about the 6% of core nodes on AWS - are these just experimental or ? Does anybody here have experience running a node long term on AWS? Seems expensive / why not just use an old “good enough” system at home and only pay the (minuscule) electricity bill, vs the (presumably higher) AWS monthly cost?
I’m all for cloud services, but I run my node local partially because I’m cheap. :)

IMO the security "need" varies depending on the situation. One person's adequate solution may be woefully inadequate (or overly paranoid) for another.
Suggest anyone thinking about this start with understanding the EXTREME methods of bitcoin private key security, and then decide for yourself how much to "dial it back" for your own needs, as appropriate. OR not at all. :)
Take some time to read up on the Glacier protocol - worth a read just so you can better understand things.
