Bitcoin is inherently socialist, its literally created and maintained by the masses.

Wow, thank you!
Shucks I just noticed that was last updated in November 2013...
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:33:05
No I haven't, but it was what kinda sparked the questions.

Right I understand HFT also pumps stocks up though, I imagine if it was applied to bitcoin, it may only affect prices at/within a single exchange, since HFT arbatrige would be nearly impossible due to block confirmation times, I'm having a hard time imagining what would happen on a macro scale.

Aye, bitcoin is so close to ISK. ;)

This isn't a pro-bitcoin sub though...
It's *the* sub *for* bitcoin. Not some cultist circle jerk.
I realize I'm gonna be lumped in with the haters for saying this, full disclosure: I have never held a single satoshi, but I've been following bitcoin since the start. I really think bitcoin is cool.
Bitcoins biggest fucking problem is the goddamn cult following that doesn't think we should ever talk about anything negatively relating to BTC, ironically enough this thread is occurring while another fucking exchange is getting gox'd.
No, sorry, this isn't the sub for your "too the moon" pump and dump bullshit where bad news is actually good news. I really think it is in the best interest of this sub not to have some "volunteer" preemptively censoring trolls with opinions you don't deem kosher.
As for actual trolls, is it that hard to click the down vote button?
A true pro-bitcoin sub is @_date: 2015-05-11 10:58:19
a way to anonymize transactions

Would you mind naming the products?
I'm incredibly fascinated by this, and am very tempted to build a POC, and would love to do some more research.

IDK man, bitcoin seems to sync with socialist idealogies pretty well.
bitcoin is operated by people, for the benefit of people.

that's like 10 employees salary

lol wtf is that thumbnail?
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:07:13
Yeah, straight up. If i could buy a soda from the gas-station down the street, with bitcoin, then bitcoin would have utility to me.
I don't benefit in any way by using bitcoin over usd or even my debit card.
Its fascinating as hell, though, and that's why I'm always lurking here.
@_date: 2015-03-16 09:53:57


I'm not really sure if that's how it works, thanks for the explanation of everything else though!
@_date: 2015-03-30 01:51:58
You really ought to look at the people saying they're 100% bitcoin further down the thread...

Unfortunately this almost never happens.

It's February 19th, 2018. I wake up, check my iphone. Good, AAPL is up another 5% overnight to around $18k per share. The world is starting to come around to the notion of shiny bullshit, but us early adopters know there's still more to come. A lot more.
I've been accumulating shares since 2014 with each paycheck. Not to brag, but I've got quite the nest egg. Best of all, nobody knows it but me. No bankers. No stock brokers. Just me and Tim Cook.
I shower and get dressed. I take my dog for a walk. The sun is shining and all of the windows drones are headed to their lousy jobs. My phone beeps. Ha, Jony Ive just tweeted that Google is getting bought by Apple. Nice.
After a short breakfast I head to the car dealership where I test drive the latest from Tesla. Think I'll wait a bit. After world markets started quoting the price of oil in AAPL, I don't really sweat the ups and downs of ipad prices. Think I'll stick with what I have. Besides, I don't want my neighbors to realize that the scruffy hipster next door is one of the richest people in town.
I drop by my office (literally MY office since I own the whole building). AAPL is up another 2% on the GOOG news..sweet! Most of my tenants pay their rent in ApplePay. Every month they each swing by with a ipad. No need for a shady middle man or bank. Ah, forgot to mention that my office building is actually an old Microsoft Store. They seem to be closing up left and right these days.
After a little work (have to keep up appearances, right) I close up and head over to the bar. Things are a little slow so I fire up some angry birds on the ol' Iphone Too bad android fell off the map...such a shame that ApplePay took the whole thing down. Over in the corner of the bar some goobers play video games. Good luck fellas have fun putting your cash in EA's wallet.
With not much going on around town I head home and watch JOBS on Netflix. Man I love that movie. The part where Steve fires the guy that doesn't like pretty fonts is my favorite part. Afterwards I fire up the grill and cook up some prime steaks from the butcher, paid for with ApplePay of course. I love getting a 20% discount for paying in ApplePay. Just as the delicious smoke starts drifting away from the grill, the neighborhood suckers start coming home from their jobs. Bet you guys wish you hadn't bet on PC.

Would you mind disclosing your specs/bandwidth?
I want to run one too, but I want to run one faster than yours. ;)
