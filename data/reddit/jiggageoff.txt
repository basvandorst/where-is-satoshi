Not necessarily.
That expression is often used to indicate that one is not willing/interested in engaging with a difficult situation.  (Most often interpersonal conflict.)  In this context, it doesn't have a negative connotation, but more a, "I'm good, that shit's too much of a bother", vibe to it.
The cryptocurrency market is complicated.  If you don't NEED to get into it, why go through the hassle?  Why make headaches for yourself?
If you're doing well at crypto, you are working very hard at it.  For some people, they'd rather sit back and let their money do the work.

Maybe that quote (the one you suggested, not the one from the OP) is taken out of context.
He has enough money that he will never spend it all - and will be donating the bulk of it to charity when he passes; maybe he wouldn't touch it because he doesn't need the money?  Or maybe he wouldn't touch it because if someone like him did, it might destabilize the market even more than it is, just by sheer virtue of the act?
Just because someone wouldn't invest in bitcoin doesn't mean that they are fundamentally opposed to it; just that it's not the right investment for them.  This is true for a lot of people.  I have family and friends who are like, "should I buy into bitcoin?", after discussing with me the profits I have made.  My answer to them, usually, is "probably not".
It's not easy.  And it's not guaranteed.  And if you forget either of those things for a second, you will end up holding some very heavy bags.

That link outlines the fact that a person cannot be discriminated against on the basis of their gender identity; it does not mean "you go to jail if you don't use a person's preferred pronoun".  
It means that you can't discriminate against them, for instance, refusing to hire them because they use a female pronoun.  
This is a good thing.  But leave it to alt-right alarmists like Jordan Peterson to misrepresent the law to further a political narrative.  
Your links PROVE my position; not yours.

You seem to have it confused.  
No one is silencing him; but freedom of speech does not include freedom from consequences of that speech.

Surely you understand the difference between "denying service to an entire group or class of people" versus "denying service to a specific individual for violating a Terms of Service agreement that that individual entered into",  yes?  
That's a rhetorical question.  I know you don't.

What you said here makes literally no sense.  It is word salad.  I can't even begin to piece together what it is you were trying to say.

According to your own link, it's a law that is only applicable to health care workers and the keeping of records.
That's the end of me entertaining your alt-right bullshit.  You're wrong.

I never have this problem because - get this - I don't go full vegan about crypto.
It's not the subject, it's you shoehorning it into conversations where it is not relevant that prompts people to call you a loser.

First of all, I never even made that claim.  Truth be told, I never bothered trying to cash out with Quadriga, because of all of the horror stories I read online about it.
I mean, isn't the purpose of crypto to KEEP your currency?  Why would I want to cash it out?
I think your claim is preposterous because you clearly miss the point.

You shouldn't look down on anyone, period.  You aren't better than anyone else.  You aren't superior to anyone else.
Everything you have can be taken away from you.  You are closer to being in the shoes of the people you cast contempt towards than you think - and if you don't think you are, you're even more self-deluded than you come off.
Enjoy your precipice from on high, it must be awfully lonely.

Currencies that are very volatile (i.e. "not good to have right now") are exactly the ones you'll make money off of day trading.
I'm going to be honest with you, you don't really seem to have a firm grasp of the concept, or what you'd need to do to be successful as a day trader, so I'd recommend against it.
It's not a dig at you; it's very difficult and unless you kind of intuitively know how to game the system to turn a profit, you'll just end up wasting money and time.

I'm gonna be that guy, and call BS on this.
Quadriga has had insolvency issues for a very long time, and the circumstances of his 'death' seem very suspicious.
He allegedly passed away suddenly well over a month ago at or around the age of 30 due to complications from Crohn's disease - a disease not known to be fatal by any stretch of the imagination, particularly not young, otherwise healthy people - in India (a country would not have accurate/reliable records to verify) while "opening an orphanage"; it reads like a bad 419 scam.  And we're just NOW hearing about it?
Sorry to sound callous, but I don't buy it, I think he's alive and well and has faked his death to escape his obligations.
@_date: 2019-01-15 22:04:59
Which is as statistically plausible as a tree falling on him and killing him.
Nice pun at the end though.
@_date: 2019-01-16 03:14:56
Okay, and?
Does that make this story somehow more believable?  Because I still don't buy it.

What does the word "premissioned" mean?

I'm glad that you have done well for yourself.  But just because you did it doesn't mean everyone else can.  Did you stop to think for a moment that you might have a skill or talent - or even a different set of life circumstances - that others may not?
Some people are fortunate.  Others are not.  I have seen people work their fingers to the bone for next to nothing, and I have seen others fall ass-backwards into riches they didn't lift a finger to earn.  Be grateful for what you have, and take pride in what you have earned, but never look down upon those who don't have the same as you.  No matter how well-off you think you are, life can take it all away from you.

I don't know which comment is more ridiculous, yours, or OP's daughter's.
I'll say yours, because you are probably old enough to know better, but obviously don't.
