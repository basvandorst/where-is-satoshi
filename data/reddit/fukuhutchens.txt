While I disagree that is a major concern, since Ln will reduce the growth rate of all those chains. It does pose similar problems for centralization as increasing blocksize.  Your LN node now has to have more storage space to store multiple chains rather than one, and more bandwidth to keep those chains updated. Which is part of the issue with just increasing the blocksize

Just because there isn't a rent cost on the bill doesn't mean it isn't factored into the cost of the food. If every customer spent twice as long in the restaurant and decreased the number of severed customers, prices would go up to increase profit per customer.

Why do you assume that node runners will be wealthy? Currently running a node offers no financial incentive, only privacy.

It isn't advocating trust in an exclusive group, just a knowledgeable group. Anyone can be a dev if they have the technical knowhow. The issue with BU isn't that it isn't core, it's that BU's implementation and even the theoretical background of EC aren't well founded. Technologically sound non-core implementations aren't automatically bad, e.g. Knots.

Surely not using asicboost if you can is just as poor a business decision as not including it?

Prices on all exchanges are currently following bitfinex up though.

It does contradict. You claimed common people had an abundance of gold. If gold is being used for high value transactions then it still has value above coffee beans, but less practicality. This is similar to the current btc situation. Bitcoin for high value transactions, fiat or altcoins for low value. 
Hopefully after Segwit we will see Bitcoins practicality increase.

LBC is just an abbreviation for localbitcoins, but the poster isn't the one being banned, he's showing evidence of any one who posts the link having their post removed by reddit, which the moderators can't undue.
