Ha! You said Liberal, just like your sister Rush Limbaugh.

“Their”, “They” ��������....good stuff.

Well, I know what my strategy is going to be next December!
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:54:50
Man, I certainly hope so. I’d mortgage my mama’s house and retire by next December!

True but there is a ton of US fiscal/tax year funds involved. This effects the global economy as well. Once again, normal behavior. Right now would be a good time to record a loss before buying again as well.

We are at a buy in point and the movement downward creates a greater possibility for gains on the up side. Fluctuations make short gains very possible as well. Day traders live off of that. A quick 5% shot on 100k ain’t bad. And that’s small money.

Invest big long and small short. If you ride the waves you can pay your rent or your car. Buy low, sell high. Opportunity is definitely there.

You should go a little longer than that. It’s already hit just below 20. Next ride will go a bit past. Take it to 20 at least.

It will go to 20k in the near future. Yes. You should get in but don’t do anything irresponsible. Invest what you can lose.

Good. Drop baby! Daddy needs some better bitcoin positions!

Bitcoin don’t give a fuck
@_date: 2018-06-03 20:11:47
The crypto space is all about obeying laws and regulations....
@_date: 2018-06-03 20:16:44
Moral of the story? Bitcoin is far more trustable than fiat. 
@_date: 2019-06-02 20:27:15
Buy high, sell low....right???

Just wait til the market goes bearish again. You’ll ignore that shit like calls from your ex.

I’m letting this guy manage my money. He seems to have all the inside info.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:49:31
Or trade. It’s ok to trade.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:52:36
Exactly. More opportunity to ride the waves in the crypto space. Surf’s up mofos!

Brand recognition has a ton of value
