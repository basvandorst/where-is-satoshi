Can you elaborate or maybe ELI5?

I was looking for a tool like this, this is great!
Would be great to see fees in satoshi/kbyte too!

I like this idea.
There's redundancy (multiple people has the seed words, and the correct order is sent by multiple email services, to multiple family members). While the seed words are separated from the key (the correct order). The email services can't do anything with the key alone, and don't even know it's a key. 
It's technically simple to set it up, and easy to redeem.
I think it might be more secure to use BIP39 to secure the seed words while keeping the same simplicity. 
Seed words are shared with family members, BIP39 password shared by email scheduling or the other way around.
The wallet that someone gets when using the seed words in the random order (or without the BIP39 password) can hold a small amount of coins. If coins are moved then someone in the family tried to take the coins or the seed was compromised somehow. (Although it doesn't really matter if it's compromised, because the main wallet is still protected by the seed words in the correct order or by the password)
Instructions can be left with family members along with the seed words, kept hidden in multiple places in their homes, hidden in xmas presents, books, under clipboards etc, so even if every member lost their word list they will likely to run into it eventually.
Giving yourself a big window to reset the switch with a good number of notifications by e-mail and SMS might be beneficial in case you get into the hospital, lose control over e-mail acc, phone, jailed etc. 
Maybe a yearly reset, with 6 month window or 6 months reset with a six month window to delay the switch with an other six months.
Timing the switch to a memorable date (new year, someones birthday) will make the switch less likely forgettable.

He could basically took customers coins saying someone stole it, but will only give it back if it's claimed within a month.
If 50% of the coins were claimed and payed back, he still stole 75BTC while posing as a good guy who refunds losses.

Is it better to download the same app from github and use that in the browser without network connection?
Any safer alternatives to  ?

BISQ doesn't have any data about the number of transactions a seller made.
But regulators can still place an order, get the bank details then look into the transactions the account made.

The bank doesn't know those transactions are crypto related so no reason to flag them. They might ask questions after a while, but that's less likely with low volumes, and they might accept some simple answers. With high volume trading one might want to open a corporate account, there are offshore corps, E-banks to use as trading accounts without having to deal with strict bank regulations, multiple accounts can be used to share the volume so there are many options.
Regulations will make things harder, that's how it works.

Verify the following on coinb.in
* The redeemScript is corresponding to the multisig escrow address where the payment was sent.
* The multisig escrow address needs 2 of 2 keys.
* The payment arrived on the multisig escrow address (look up the address on a blockchain explorer, note balance and the number of confirmations should be at least 1)
What happens if the buyer has a problem and doesn't want to give you the key? The coins will be stuck in the escrow address.
 
Or the buyer can say the product is bad, he's only signing a transactions where he get's 80% refund. 
Even in case everything went right and the buyer sends you his keys, can you create a tx, sign it with both keys and broadcast a tx?

How did you find accounts that used Silk Road?
