bitcoin is a new form of payment currency technology ran on Bitcoins Blockchain where transactions are verified by the peer to peer decentralized mining network which is propagated to miners to tell them that a transaction has been verified or not, once its been verified the transactions is pooled into a block and added to the blockchain which is a chain of blocks that has been linked on one after another since jan 3rd 2009 at 6.15.05pm on the Saturday, why not use bitcoin and add to the latest block, be your own bank and move into the future : )

Attended G20 Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) What is the future of digital currencies globally? How will governments cope with the growth of Bitcoin? The Global Digital Currency Conversation Forum in Brisbane will seek to answer these questions and more when it brings together the brightest minds from government and industry to continue the conversation on this exciting field at the G20.
The two day event was very interesting with world leaders in the field of digital currency talking about the exciting opportunities around Bitcoin and digital currencies new start-ups and business's looking to adopt the currency and how Australia should embrace the technology and provide a clear path for the industry, The ATO also had a few things to say about where the regulatory stance is and where governments view its new tax rulings of 10% on Bitcoin.

Dont want to do that as i need to show that the ad is available
Ill look to see if i can shrink the the ad size  
When you say forums do you mean threads as there is only 1 forum then 4 categories, and 24 threads. and then sub threads. 
I would like to keep the threads to show what content is available as people will likely post in a broad-categorized area and might get messy.

Governments, the monopoly of coercive force, are only interested in taxing people. Bitcoin, right now at least, seems untaxable. Taxation is theft and governments are mad because they cannot steal anymore. Bitcoin owners and miners have the moral high ground, not governments.

Okay let me explain I have 2 wallets mine and my brothers I have 300 bitcoin (not anymore sold ect) and my brother has a 30 bitcoin wallet which he forgot his password too.
Now I was in contact with Dave the guy that cracks people's wallets if you forgot password to it you just need to know some of the password. I did get a little confused when the spam email was sent to me thinking it something to do with Dave. So I went ahead and downloaded it I extracted the contents I used the attackers wallet to see what it was now it had 50 bitcoin but the receiving address was missing and you could not generate another one. I let it sync up but it was encrypted after I opened the password file to see if I could move the btc at this stage it was for experimental reasons as I have never seen a wallet that had a missing receiving address. Once I played around with it, it had copied my contact info from my wallet.dat when i put my wallet in as the primay, I then put my brothers wallet.dat as the primary wallet and opened it. It must of taken a screen shot of it, That had just over 30 BTC in it but the password is not known. 
So to sum it up downloaded attackers wallet it copied my wallet info and took a screen shot of my brothers wallet.
Very cleaver stuff but if you receive the email delete it.

According to a joint report by Cyrus Farivar of Ars Technica and Pierre Alonso of Le Monde, Karpelès was found guilty of fraud when he was tried in absentia in France in 2010.

I agree with you as a bitcoin user, i hope also that it gets better, I'm just telling you what the miner preference is and what fee was made with the transaction this makes it dynamic unfortunately.  
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:30:36
Low miner preference but it should go through, just have to wait.

 If you lose your phone, you need to get a new Android device and re-install Mycelium. When you open the Mycelium app for the first time, it will ask you if you want to create a new wallet or recover a wallet. Click the recover wallet option.  You will be prompted to enter your recovery phrase and your wallet (with all its funds) will be restored! have you tried this &gt;?

This is what i said to him 
 
I agree with most of what you are saying but in 5 - 10 Years it will be a mature Technology and underlie the infrastructural backbone of the internet as a mass shared bank account so people can move money/stocks/smart contracts/intellectual property/land ownership globally peer to peer on the decentralized blockchain and sidechain digital infrastructure without government intervention, End user usability is very poor at this point in time but smart developers and VCs are pouring mass amounts of fiat and time into the system to get it to a stage where it is very easy to use., You have to ask yourself how easy is it to move 1KG of gold overseas and what fees and effort it would take compared to moving the same value amount overseas using the Bitcoin Technology it does excel in that regard you have to think critically and not remove any economic tool from your thinking. Bitcoin is a power shift from the private banks back to the people same with Gold and Silver.  So i would say it is a economic tool just like gold it has difference purposes just like gold and silver. I see myself as pro Bitcoin and Litecoin i have been involved since 2012 and understand the technology very well about 70 % - 80 % but don't understand everything about it i am also a Silverbug and would like to own gold too but its just a little bit expensive for me right now, i do love the proprieties history and status of the precious metals and think they will continue to exist long after today and likely to thrive in economic turmoil.  ﻿
