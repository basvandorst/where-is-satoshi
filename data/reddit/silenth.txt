@_date: 2014-06-13 17:48:59
if your pool doesn't solve any blocks in that couple of weeks you get zero payments for zero BTC and the difficulty went up. ghash.io is solving blocks every 5-15 minutes. taking smaller payments almost guaranteed is far more attractive than taking larger payments due to smaller pool size, yet with no guaranteed you'll get any blocks solved.

it would be the best compromise for everyone. Assuming  people could get consistent payouts through P2Pool, i firmly believe people would be mining there.
Granted you will be giving up a lot of nice to have features (reporting, seamless merged mining, detailed stats, etc..) but loosing that and waiting 2-3 weeks for a block? why would anyone move?

This assumes that Coinpocket maintains your password. **They do not.** Your Private key is created on and stored on your device. Coinpocket has nothing to do with your passwords/keys. Who's going to email it to you?
If you cannot take responsibility for securing your password then use a web wallet. But your going to be even more pissed if it gets hacked/stolen/lost through some breech at the web wallet site.
That being said, don't remove the app. You'll wake up in the middle of the night 2 weeks from now and just remember it.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:58:44
So you want miners to secure your network, but  they should not invest in mining equipment with the desire to make a profit, yet you can purchase bitcoin with the long term goal of making profit..
All makes sense now.

any plans for alt coin ports?
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:52:49
Well, once they do move to P2Pool, I think a lot of people will jump ship once the daily payouts start to drop significantly, which they will.

I tend to agree that any malicious behavior is going to be caught almost immediately, especially with all eyes on them at the moment. 
I also would love to see the majority of miners move to P2Pool. But chicken and egg. Those mining at ghash.io are there because they are getting payouts every 8-20 minutes consistently. If they are there when the pool is at 50% then they plan to stay until they can see the same type of payments elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:40:43

* If you buy 100 GH's today for 0.006 you spend 0.6 BTC 
* You mine for 30 days earning the BTC rewards from your 100GH's shares - the maintenece fee. 
* You then see that GH's are trading for 0.007 and decide to sell them for 0.7BTC 
How have you not profited all the way around? 
There are no long term contracts. you are free to buy and sell the GHs at will as much as you want on their trading page. It is an extremely active market. You can also chose to trade your GHs for actual hardware for the cost of shipping, assuming you own enough GH's to match the hash power of the rigs. Simply put, there is no contract with regard to term length.
Im not claiming its the answer to all mans problems, just clarifying how it works.


I'm not ignoring it, I completely agree that there is an inherent risk in the system. I simply wish that people choosing to mine at their pool had at least as much responsibility as the pool operator.
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:36:42

you can. its not equipment rental or lease, its equipment purchase based available mining hardware. This assumes you own enough GH's to claim a piece of hardware. I believe the smallest units are 110GHs.
I haven't heard of many people doing that though. most people resell their ownership shares when they leave. Cant find any data that reflects redemption rate.

@_date: 2014-06-13 21:04:19




except we are not talking 2 pools we are talking many pools. 30 days mining on Slush will not net me the same amount of coin that 30 days of mining on ghash.io will. Yes, the math says "over time" the problem is "over time" does not  care about ROI.
Look I'm not arguing over with you that CEX/Ghash has to many people mining at it. Im simply agree with the OP, and understanding why miners aren't running away in droves to get away form ghash.

Credit Card verification still seems broken for a lot of people. For some reason their CC transaction host has issues with address verification. Went back and forth between my bank and the coinbase for 2 weeks and finally gave up.
Response from coinbases verification form: "your address cannot be verified, please confirm it is entered correctly."

Shit my BTC disappeared. Who can I talk to about this?
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:12:33
why is this so hard?
If you mine at ghash right now, you are being paid, real time every 5-10 minutes. if you mine at slush its maybe 2-3 times a day, if you mine with p2pool it might be every 3 weeks.
And no the payments don't equal out across all pools over your ROI time. There are simply too many people at ghash.io for people to move to a pool who is only going to solve blocks at a fraction of the ghash.io rate. 
If every pool out there were solving an equal # of blocks then yes you can move pools willynilly without a care because your loss from the move would be absorbed quickly, but
All this time the amount of coins any particular rig can earn per hash will decrease as difficulty increases.
if you spend $10,000 on mining equipment and want to make ROI where would you mine?

invest in the infrastructure. spend $200 to purchase an Antminer S1, point it at a P2Pool. Add 180GHs to the P2Pool global hashrate.
If it makes you feel better consider yourself a transaction confirmer if you don't want to be a miner. They'll pay you a little satoshi for the trouble as well :)
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:54:32
but it does work exactly like that. I did it.
* I purchased 500GHs at .0068 (3.4btc) on April 30th. 
* I sold 500GHs at .007255 (3.6275btc) on June 3rd.
* In that time I mined 0.605btc
* My Profit from the GHs I owned then sold was 0.2275btc
* total profit for 33 days was 0.8325 btc
Im not sure how that is a ponzi scheme. the initial GHs shares were sold from CEX.io but now they belong to whoever bought them and are openly traded and backed up by hardware I can claim at any time and receive for the cost of shipping.
I'm not arguing the fact that ghash.io has too much of the Bitcoin pool share. But people are in fact making profit off the GHs. Claiming they are not is only going to have people ignore arguments for the real problem which is getting miners to point their equipment at other pools.

Simply point your mining equipment at the P2Pool address just like any other pool. Use your Bitcoin wallet address as your username, and use anything/nothing for a password.
How much more simple can it be? You don't have to run your own P2Pool. Use one of the hundreds already running.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:20:43
I don't think people are buying GH's for long term investments. I think most are using it to supplement mining when they cannot afford a new piece of hardware. Yes if someone bought GHs today expecting to profit form them in  a year from now, I would agree with you. 
One could also argue that buying a mining rig would be a bigger waste of money because you're now stuck with a piece of hardware 6 months later that is completely worthless.
Buying GHs is no different than buying hardware and leaving it in a data center with the seller.  Ill mine away earning BTC from my hardware, paying a maintenance fee to the data center for their power. The difference is I can chose to sell the hardware to someone else at anytime. All of it at once or pieces of it in increments of 0.00001 GH's.
If the price goes down, im still better off than unplugging the hardware in my garage and putting it in storage.
I don't need to read your other posts. We just disagree with each other on whether or not GH's is a ponzi scheme or not. Your arguments aren't going to change my mind on the matter. I have used the service, I apparently have a different understanding of the product than you do.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:56:26
Wow you are angry.
@_date: 2014-05-14 00:17:18
If you are going to Cloud Hash, then GHash/CEX.io is probably the way to go. The price is market driven. you trade the GH's among other miners and if you waitfor the right timing can make a little profit from buying and selling the GH's. While you own them you earn BTC paid to you minus their maintenance fee.
As of this post GH's are trading for around 0.0069 BTC per 1 GH's. You purchase one, it immediately starts mining BTC for you. you can later sell the GH's to someone else on their extremely active exchange.
My experience has been good. I Purchased about 570 GH's at 0.00632 and sold them for 0.00698. I have slowly been buying back in while looking for bargain sellers. During that couple of weeks i was mining with 570GHs and earning additional BTC.

We don't know the number but for sake of argument lets say half of their current 40PHs is their own equipment, the other half is people pointing their own personal miners in their garages at ghash.io, your suggested solution only addresses half the hashrate, that isn't going to stop the minute people stop buying GHs. Those machines keep on running.
Miners with personal hardware need to point their hardware someplace else. 
CEX.io/ghash.io has done nothing to warrant the type if vitriol hatred I see towards them. They are a business, who employ people, trying to make a profit. Get angry at the people who use their pool. Get angry at the other pool operators who offer none of the features that are driving people to ghash.io.
Ill reserve any anger until I see proof that CEX is actually actively attempting to subvert the bitcoin network. Until then id rather we look at longer term solutions through development updates to better handle situations like these. Move all miners to BTC guild and the same problems happens there. Its not the Pools fault, its the miners.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:33:10
@_date: 2014-06-07 19:46:03
No they don't. Whether someone is renting their equipment or not it will still continue to mine. The rewards either go 100% to CEX.io or 80% to the contracting customer and 20% to CEX.io in maintenance fees.
Either way their equipment mines away 24/7..
there is no other reputable equivalent for people to go to.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:25:41
If the cloud miners go elsewhere, the rigs CEX was using  stay on hashing away.
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:54:01
We dont have to imagine because what he stated is fact. the price has been very stable lately and with the daily changes you can indeed sell your GH's at break even or slightly ahead, and reap the  reward from those hashes while you owned them. People are doing it everyday.
Yes the price is down since the product was released, but now that the price has stabilized, people can and do basically mine for free.
