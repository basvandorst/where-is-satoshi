This is a throwaway account for security reasons. 
I made the mistake of telling a few family members when I discovered an old wallet containing a bit over 500 BTC. It was an in the moment thing, I was celebrating and got a bit drunk. 
I was told one of my relatives was spreading rumours that I'm sitting on 40 million in bitcoin, in my house. I don't know how many people they've told this to. But it makes me extra nervous, because even although it's not true, if criminals get wind of this they could break in and kill/torture my family. 
Lately I've been getting strange phone calls. I'm now worried for the safety of my family. 
My plan is to travel the world for about 12 months why we continue to HODL. I've already cashed out enough bcash to do this for 2 years in comfort. After this we will buy units and citizenship in multiple countries then continually move between them until it's mostly into other assets or the bitcoin hype dies down. If the price crashes to zero then I can return home and resume a normal life. 
I've stopped posting anything on social media accounts. I've quit work. And I'm about to cut most contact with most of my old friends and relatives. Perhaps I will reconnect with them in a few years? I also find it hard to trust anyone new that I meet. I'm hoping a fresh start in a new country will make it easier to trust new people.    
Even though I now have more money than I could ever dreamed of, in many ways I would rather this never happened to me.    
Sometimes I feel relieved when the bitcoin price drops, and nervous when it gets too high or too much media attention.
Take it from me. Don't ever tell anyone about your bitcoin holdings. Even if you only have 10 or 20 they may be worth a lot more in the future. If you have any, tell people you sold them. Do it now, because if the price goes higher you won't have a chance.
