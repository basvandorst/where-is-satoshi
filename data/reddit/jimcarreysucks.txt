Sale day!

I purchased bitcoin on Circle for the first time the other day.  It was an easy experience and I'm glad to have competition in the US.

I guess "falling" is relative.  Widen the visible timeline to change perspective.

I love waking up to these kinds of stories.  Yes, they can make buying online difficult.  They can send the tax man after people.  They can even outlaw things if they want.
BUT THEY CAN NOT EVER STOP IT.
Not even the "smart" prize-winning economists among us seem to realize this.

Why do you say it's outdated?
@_date: 2016-09-07 02:59:34
This is BS.  Just curious, what kind of volume do you trade in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:08:40
Because price is not my main motivator. Yes, I bought most of my BTC a few years ago, but I believe in the idea more than anything.

Lol I just went through this a few weeks ago.  When you're the one responsible for ensuring things get sent from A to Z accurately, shit gets real!

Understood.  Also know that the FCC does have an active monitoring and enforcement bureau.  You'd have to be careful to avoid enforcement action and fines.  Even on anonymous CB radio, they (currently rarely) do track people down and fine then huge sums of cash.

Its against FCC regulations to use your amateur radio/license to broadcast, or to accept money for the use of your radio or your transmission services in the US.  It's in the FCC part 97 rules.  You are also prohibited from passing third party messages to persons in countries without a 3rd party traffic agreement with the US. Just throwing that out there to add to the discussion.

My corpse will stay strapped into the Bitcoin roller coaster.  I keep a spending wallet and a hold wallet that I've had for years.  I'm prepared to lose my investment, or ride it to the Moon.  Either way, welcome to the ride, new folks :-)

You're right, anyone can listen without a license.  But the  transmitter wouldn't be able to pass a transaction for anyone else, as I'm assuming that service wouldn't be free.  Also, they wouldn't be able to send the transaction to any country without a 3r d party agreement for anyone else, even without charge.  So basically I think a few personal transactions to allowed countries might work, but alas, there is one more issue.  You're not allowed to broadcast at all. Other than calling CQ, you need to be passing a message to another operator.  I'm fairly certain that transmitting message data fairly frequently without an intended specific recipient would qualify as broadcasting, which is prohibited.  There is precedent for setting up beacons,  such as the JT65 protocol, but again even with that, you're fishing for a respondent to conduct a QSO with.  I guess that could work, transmit "CQ " YOURCALL, HASH DATA.".  Response from distant station: "THEIRCALL, YOURCALL, ACK HASH DATA.". Your response: " YOURCALL, THEIRCALL, ACK ACK, 73". With maybe some confirmation data added in there. It would also have to be in plain text no matter the transmission protocol used as encryption is not allowed. I'm not saying any personal or third party transactions would not be possible.  Im just saying that in the US, using amateur radio for this purpose comes with many restrictions and may prove cumbersome.

This is a fun discussion for me BTW :-). I love that this even comes up in discussion because of Bitcoin's mere existence!

I'm guessing that a "licensee" that accepts a fee for receiving and passing block chain data would be in violation technically, but average Joe shortwave scanner listener would of course be out of reach of the law.  Anonymous CB radio might be better suited for this, though you're not allowed data transmission on that band

I'm not a lawyer, but I know a little bit.  I know enough that you won't illegally search my shit.
