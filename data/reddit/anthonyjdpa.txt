The percentage of nodes which are full nodes is quite different from the percentage of the economy which is checking transactions with at least one full node. Which are you saying is far under 85%, and how are you measuring that?
Also, if the only scenario where the Bitcoin protocol comes into relevance at all is when there is an invalid chain with more work than the valid chain, wouldn't a cheap way to check for that scenario be to see whether or not there are multiple chains with more than a couple relatively recent blocks? "Relatively recent" defined as within 5 hours could probably detect a situation where only 15% of miners were on the valid chain. Whenever that scenario happens, an SPV node could stop counting confirmations temporarily and provide a warning to use a full node.

I think it's perfectly in line. The fact that there is no central authority is exactly why miners have every right to get behind closed doors and say, "right, this is happening." Bear in mind that "this is happening" doesn't mean that anyone has to follow them. You have every right to maintain a 1x chain forever, but if you want to do so, you need to use your own equipment to mine it.
I think the Segwit2X folks did a much *better* job than the Bitcoin Cash folks when it comes to this. S2X was announced a month ago, and the least compatible parts will not take effect for three more months. The businesses and miners who support it have done so openly. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, made significant compatibility-breaking changes just a few days before forking off. These changes were decided behind closed door, and only a handful of developers and users were involved in the decision. Furthermore, no one knows exactly what businesses and miners are supporting Bitcoin Cash, but there seems to be a lot of support coming from somewhere (there is significant support from miners, or at least one miner, despite the fact that these miners or this miner could be making a lot more money mining BTC).
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:11:54


A small number of people were involved in creating Bitcoin Cash. They don't speak for all of us.
Personally, I'm torn right now. Bitcoin Cash has a *lot* of problems. Segwit2x is a much better solution. But right now, Bitcoin Cash is receiving all of the attention. Hopefully that will change over the next few months, and Segwit2x will happen. Barring that, hopefully the problems with Bitcoin Cash will be fixed.

I like how you chopped up my sentences and took them out of context.
If a miner, possibly running Core, rejects Block  because it is bigger than 1mb and builds upon Block  with a different block, that will cause a chain fork.

A hard fork is a move to more lenient consensus rules. 2x doesn't change any consensus rules except that it requires miners to mine a single block with a base size &gt;1mb.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:26:21
I don't have a problem. That rule is a restriction, not a loosening. So long as &gt;50% of miners enforce it, 2x is compatible with all wallets which can handle &gt;1mb blocks.
Some people think 2x should break that compatibility, calling that breakage "replay protection." But fortunately, no one seems to support doing that.
The right solution is for Core (and any others making software that can't handle &gt;1mb blocks) to fix their wallet software so that it can handle blocks that are &gt;1mb. This is not a difficult fix to make, but if it's not made, and anyone mines a block using this broken software, 1x will fork off.

"Replay protection" is just a euphemism for compatibility-breaking changes.

In a word, no. This is an emergency upgrade which is meant to be as compatible as possible. By all means *also* do a long-term fix after a year or more, but we need bigger blocks as soon as possible.

There are lots of types of forks. There are hard forks, there are soft forks, there are chain forks, there are code forks, there are git forks. I know the differences.
Just repeating that I don't know what I'm talking about isn't much of an argument. If you want to show that 2X is a hard fork, it's up to *you* to define hard fork and show why 2X meets that definition. My position is that 2X is *not* a hard fork, because it doesn't loosen any consensus rules. To show me wrong, you would need to either show that hard forks don't (necessarily) require a loosening of consensus rules, or you would need to explain how 2X loosens consensus rules.
2X is a soft fork. It requires that the base size of block  is &gt; 1MB. 1X is also a soft fork. It requires that the base size of block  is &lt;= 1MB. Two incompatible soft forks at the same time make for a chain split, if at least one block is created on each side. This is because a minority soft fork causes a chain split, and if two incompatible soft forks occur at the same time, at least one of them must be a minority soft fork.

Why M1? Isn't Bitcoin more equivalent to M0? If Bitcoin ever takes over *all* money (and it's not clear exactly why it would), there will still be a need for loans, so there will still be a money multiplier on top of the 21 million Bitcoin base.
To put it another way, Bitcoin doesn't preclude fractional reserve banking. With fractional reserve banking those 21 million BTC could be 210 million BTC in demand deposits.

When you get 20 parties down, the bigger problem is that "the coin" isn't identifiable. Bitcoin coins usually get mixed together very quickly.

@_date: 2017-10-04 15:15:09


Trivial, maybe, but it would be a terrible idea. There's quite a difference between a change (bigger blocks) that has been supported by at least one "full node" client (Bitcoin Unlimited) for 20+ months and adding a new compatibility-breaking change with only a few weeks to go.
Besides, like you admit yourself:


Your suggestion, like this change, would be minimally useful for users. If they had done what you are saying they could have done, you would be on here complaining about how incompetent they were and how it would be trivial for them to have made it "opt-out."
They should have just ignored the cries about "replay protection" altogether. Nothing they do short of completely breaking compatibility with virtually all wallets (like Bitcoin Cash) will be acceptable to you. But at least this change will cause minimal harm, unlike your suggestion.
Hopefully this won't be the start of a slippery slope like it was for Bitcoin Cash, though.
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:54:38
Doesn't seem realistic to me. Bitcoin isn't a good substitute for gold right now, and it's not really a substitute for non black-market uses of fiat.
Maybe there will be a tipping point for black market uses of fiat. Maybe there already has been. What percentage of the black market fiat does Bitcoin currently have?
I'd include in the black market fiat anyone holding cash because they haven't declared the income on their tax returns. That's probably a large reason for the current price increases.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:40:12
Okay, but why bother? SPV is much faster, and the chances that your small business or personal transaction is going to be reversed by a multi-million dollar 50% attacker colluding with your counterparty is basically zero.
Non-miners using bitcoin for personal or small business purposes don't need to run network nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:19:43
The only simple answer to that is "it depends."
Bitcoin works best if we all use the same rules. But any group, of any level of support, has the right to try to fork, or to try to prevent a fork, if they feel strongly enough about something.
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:54:00

Luke tends to have very detailed and particular definitions for neologisms, so whether or not I misspoke by saying "P2SH wasn't really a UASF" is not really something I'm going to get into.
Whether you want to call it a "UASF" or not, the process was a lot closer to BIP9 with a 55% threshold and manual activation than it was to BIP148, which completely disregards miner support.
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:47:23
Assuming you mean the reasonable cost to run a network node as opposed to an SPV node, the reasonable cost is the expected loss that you'd incur by not running a network node, which for most personal/small business uses would be about $0.
For hobbyist purposes or educational purposes more than that is reasonable, though. :)

Exactly. That's my point. It's not just Greg M. "we do not ship code which makes it trivial for users to blow their face off, no" was from a dev.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:01:14
I'm not sure what about what I said disputes Luke. P2SH *was* the most contentious softfork to ever get activated. It was contentious, in fact, mainly because Luke fought so hard against it, to the point where several people called for having him removed from the project. Read the thread in the third link in my post above.
Also read the second link: "If a majority of hashing power does not support the new validation rules, then rollout will be postponed (or rejected if it becomes clear that a majority will never be achieved)."
And the first link: "BIP 16 (or 17) will not meet their initial "go/no-go" deadlines.  You can see the state of support here: 
That's OK, that's why the deadlines were structured the way they are; in the past, Satoshi made changes like this by simply changing the code and then expecting everybody to upgrade. This is the first time we've used a more open, community-driven process."
You also might want to look at  where the only mining pool against BIP16 as of that date was Eligius (Luke-Jr's pool)
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:05:26


Maybe, although it's really hard to measure that, and it's not even clear what it is that's being measured (the majority of people using bitcoin probably don't even know what segwit is).
But more importantly, BIP148 does *not* have anywhere near majority-of-anything support.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:55:56
Or they can set a checkpoint, just like the miners can. Or they can use invalidateblock, which works without even recompiling.

To double-spend against someone using an SPV client and waiting a few confirmations, you need to create a few blocks (expensive) and send them to that SPV client faster than the real chain sends the real blocks (50% attack, or maybe some sort of sybil attack).
It's not the sort of thing that's profitable to do in order to steal some T-shirts from Joe's Small T-shirt Business. Maybe that wasn't the best example of a personal or small business use of Bitcoin, but if you've got a better example please share it. Most of my own Bitcoin transactions are from companies that could easily steal from me by just not sending me any Bitcoin at all. There'd be no point in launching a double-spend attack against me. But some small businesses do ship things after waiting a small number of confirmations, and they do a very very very tiny additional risk from using SPV rather than full payment verification. Of course, anyone doing this attack would likely be doing it to lots of people all at once, and would probably get caught in time for police to be staked out at the shipping address watching for them to pick up the stolen property. (If you're shipping internationally so it might be tougher to get the police involved, maybe wait for 8-10 confirmations to make it even harder to pull off the attack.)
If you're not waiting for any confirmations, it's much easier to double-spend, but that's regardless of whether or not you're running a network node.
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:33:43


No, I'm really not. If I was running a large business or had a large twitter following or ran a mining pool or something maybe I'd have a significant impact on Bitcoin in general, but then, I'd also have more benefit to running a node, and would have more funds to run a network node. The average person has basically no reason to run a network node, neither an altruistic reason nor a selfish reason.
Even your example of accidentally passing someone else an invalid coin is something that has virtually zero chance of happening for the average person. And I don't know about others but if that happened to me I would make good on my payment to the other person. I'd be the one who would eat the cost for passing on that "bad check" if I couldn't find the person who passed it on to me or couldn't get them to make good on their payment. So that's already calculated in to the virtually zero risk I incur when using SPV.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:29:50
No one will be forced to do anything.
If the non-BIP148 chain survives more than 100 blocks (maybe even less) and the BIP148 chain seems to have *any* chance of *ever* catching up (which is probably going to be unlikely), someone will release software which sets a checkpoint after the split point to guard against reorganizations. People aren't just going to let over $2 million worth of mining be thrown away. Not without a good reason, like that those 100 blocks were clearly the result of a bug or something, anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:28:17


At even 1 Mbps the cost bottleneck is not going to be bandwidth.


At which point we go back to the question of what your expected loss is by just using SPV, or even just checking on blockchain.info, which is about $0 for personal/small business use.
I thought maybe this was some sort of "the network only works if everyone runs a node" argument.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:17:40
Ah, I get it. So what internet service level is "normal"?
Also, should we only count people who already keep their computers on 24/7? The cost of doing that is probably over $100/year.
(Or was this about how much is a reasonable cost to turn on your computer once a day, download the new blocks on the blockchain, and then turn it back off?)
(And yeah, you could do a lot better on electricity with a Raspberry Pi or something, but then we'd have to factor in the cost of learning how to use a Raspberry Pi. :))
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:40:11
AIUI Tycho/deepbit switched before the change was merged.
At the time the change was merged &gt;55% of miners had indicated support (that was, in fact, a prerequisite for merging the change).
P2SH wasn't really a UASF. It was activated by a process similar to BIP9 except that the threshold was 55% and the activation was manual rather than automatic.
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:56:52


They're not going to be helped by second layer systems either. How can someone making less than $6000/year afford to get into the second layer system? If txes are $100, that's nearly a *week* of salary just to set up *one* channel. And that's hardly a trustless system, as the person on the other side of the channel can drop off the network at any time causing the person to have to pay *another* $100 to close the channel (or, hopefully, close it and open a new channel with another counterparty all in one tx).
That's just not realistic. Someone in that situation will simply move to a different coin with lower tx fees. Hopefully LN will make it so that they can still transact with people in Bitcoin, by going through a third party that exchanges Altcoin for Bitcoin transparently (and trustlessly). But is that what we want? Or do we want to allow these people to set up $5 or $10 channels in Bitcoin itself?
I'd prefer to let them set up $5 or $10 channels in Bitcoin itself. But maybe we really do need a gold and a silver equivalent in crypto, for the same reason we need an actual gold and silver (more stable vs. lower tx fees).
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:52:58

Sure, I've heard the saying. I just don't think it applies to non-support for BIP148. BIP148 is not the only alternative to a corporate centralized development process. It's not even the only way to activate segwit. It might be the fastest way to activate segwit, but non-support for doing something the fastest way possible is not stupid. In fact, it's prudent.

First of all, what you showed me doesn't show anything about what the code looked like back then. But moreover, I don't deny that it activated "on a flagday." That "flagday" was set after &gt;55% of miners (and as I understand it pretty much everyone except Luke) indicated support.

If you want to nitpick about the wording of the agreement, miners never promised to activate segwit. They agreed to "run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core" (hasn't happened yet, although segwit2x fulfills this promise outside of Bitcoin Core - it is a segwit release ). They promised that they "will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production, for the foreseeable future." So far they have kept that promise, but segwit2x, upon activation of forced signaling and/or upon activation of 2x, might no longer be Bitcoin Core-compatible. (I'd say unforseeen circumstances have occurred, though).
But really who, if anyone, violated the HK agreement, is irrelevant to the point I was making. Miners want segwit and bigger base blocks (soon, not in 2024). I'm not aware of any Core devs who delivered on that (1), but even if there are, it still hasn't been merged into Core.
If the Core devs don't want to be gotten rid of by segwit2x there is a simple solution for them: Make Core compatible with segwit2x.
(1) Yes, I'm aware of Luke's infantile hard fork proposal.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:45:10
"there is a risk that your economic counterparties (ie, people you want to pay and people you want to pay you) will be on the other side of the split"
While that "risk" applies to both sides, it's by no means an equal risk for both sides. And it's not really even a risk, it just means you have to do a little bit more work. When the fork happens, you look at which side of the fork the exchanges are on, and if there are exchanges on each side then you look at the prices at those exchanges. If coins on both sides are valuable, then you have to figure out how to split your coins. If everyone you care about is all on the same side, then you can also choose to just ignore the split and run the same side as everyone else.
(Most likely the BIP148 side will be virtually worthless, but if you're worried about it just don't make any transactions for a couple days and wait to see what the values of the two different sides are.)
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:20:36
Again that is irrelevant to the point I was making. Regardless of whether or not it ever will be used again, some people, including myself and at least one Core dev, prefer it to BIP8.
BIP 9 was a mistake, because it created versionbits, which facilitate controversial soft forks, but BIP 8 just repeats that mistake and in fact makes things even worse.

I agree with that, especially with the first sentence. A key part of scaling Bitcoin will be allowing people to validate their money without running a network node.

The difference in specification between segwit2x and segwit without the 2x is not very complicated. There will surely be several clients which are compliant with segwit2x, including patches to Core if not unpatched Core itself.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:15:20
I don't think there's anything nefarious about that. Miners have wanted, or at least been willing to accept, segwit + bigger base blocks at least since the HK Agreement. The Core devs have not delivered on the second half of that. Segwit2x is an attempt to bypass them.
Whether or not segwit2x gets rid of the Core devs depends on whether or not Core stays compatible with segwit2x and if not, whether or not the Core devs abandon Core and start working on an implementation that is compatible with segwit2x.

I meant the government in general by "they." The IRS usually doesn't even have to bother with the parallel construction, because 99.9% of the time they don't even have to tell people why they were targeted for an audit.

A MASF which activates at 55% is still a MASF. 95% might not be realistic (although for reasons which have nothing to do with ASICBoost). But surely you can get &gt;55% of miners behind a "fix" to transaction malleability.


That's actually not correct, but irrelevant.

Are you referring to  ?
I don't see any promise to activate Segwit there. They promise to "run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core." But that hard-fork was never released (certainly not in a version of Bitcoin Core), and they didn't say they would signal for SegWit anyway. AIUI they're running Bitcoin Core, which *is* a SegWit release. They're just not signaling for segwit.
They also say they "will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production, for the foreseeable future." And they still are running Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, even though unforseen circumstances (including BIP148 and the lack of a hard fork in Core) have arisen which would probably be an excuse to stop doing so.

No, it's more than just Greg M. The pull request was rejected: 
Some additional conversation about it was made on the mailing list:  (that conversation does support the fact that at least the core devs who spoke there at that time were all in agreement that they wished people wouldn't just run anything they put in Core and not run anything they don't put in Core).
At the same time, I'm not sure it's smart to run software for trustless money based on one person's assurance that there's no risk (especially when that software has a big fat warranty disclaimer on it).

If that's the reason it's pretty obviously overbroad. The IRS can wait to get that information on only the people who try to claim that. Or the DOJ (not the IRS) can get the info for people they intend to press criminal charges against.

A long reorg isn't going to happen. BIP148 will quickly get a majority, it will PoW fork, or it will die. No other scenario is realistic. The difficulty change period in Bitcoin is too long for a soft fork minority chain to survive without a ton of investment. Creating 2016 blocks means forgoing $75 million in revenue.
If the BIP148 supporters have $75 million to spend to create their minority chain, they sure are doing a terrible job of getting businesses on board.


Until the difficulty changes, it will be close to 0% or it will be close to 100% and there will be no chain split. The market will decide which one. Miners follow the market, and if the difficulty of the two chains is the same, it's winner takes all.

If &gt;50% of miners stop orphaning &gt;1mb blocks, and Core isn't patched to support the chain created by those miners, Core will become irrelevant.

That may be so, but what Luke said, as I understand it, is that BIP9 + forced signaling if no activation after a certain period of time is better than BIP8. I agree with that. Backing out of a BIP8 activation is a hard fork, whereas backing out of a BIP9 activation involves simply not rolling out the forced signaling code.


I don't want to get into a discussion of the merits of this. I think lumping it together with a malleability fix was a mistake. It's a separate issue, and it's more an economic one than a technical one.


Correct. Lumping in a (poorly implemented) max block size increase with a malleability fix was also a mistake. (I say poorly implemented because the new max block size depends on the types of transactions and because it gives useless attack transactions more space than normal useful ones.)


No, it isn't. But if BIP141 fails, it should be fixed.


Bitcoin as a whole includes SPV nodes (from the very beginning), and the risks of using SPV (which are currently minimal) shouldn't be increased unnecessarily.
I also think you're waving this problem away too quickly. Miners mining invalid blocks probably isn't the worst way to exploit this. Miners withholding valid signature data and then releasing it at strategic times (c.f. "selfish mining") is probably a worse possibility.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:58:38
I know; I was being sarcastic.
With that said, you should probably be careful about giving an express warranty even if you do have a warranty disclaimer. But hey, whatever, it's your problem, not mine.

The statute of limitations is six years "for an omission from gross income of more than 25% of the gross income stated in the return" (which would apply in many situations where the individual reported *nothing* on their Schedule D -- it's gross income, not net income -- all of the gains before you subtract any of the losses). And there is no non-criminal statute of limitations on fraudulent returns.

If they could get the actual passwords it could help them a lot, as they could use it to try to find people who had created multiple accounts or were sharing accounts with multiple people. Probably such info isn't available, though. And such fishing expeditions aren't usually allowed.
But the simplest explanation is that they simply threw in the kitchen sink with the original request, and now they're conceding those parts that aren't that important (while trying their best to make it sound like they're giving up something huge).

1) It's too early for a rational miner to make that decision. It depends what's going on with segwit2x bit 4 signaling, which hasn't even started yet. It depends on what the exchanges plan on doing in the event of a split, which I don't think has been clarified by all exchanges yet. It depends on whether or not we can figure out how the market is going to value the two chains, if there is a split.
That last factor might not even be known until after the split occurs. I would think that most miners are going to be prepared to follow either chain, and ready to switch after a few blocks if their initial guess was wrong.
If the UASF chain isn't the majority chain within a few hours after the initial split, and there's no active market by then for buying and selling UASFcoin (or there is one and it doesn't indicate a price nearly as high as BTC), that chain will probably never become the majority chain. So it'd be dumb to mine the UASFcoin chain (which will have the same difficulty as the BTC chain). OTOH, if UASF has a majority, miners better follow it, and even if there is a split if UASFcoin has a price nearly as high as BTC miners would best follow it as well (as there will probably be a "wipeout").
2 and 3) This is semantics, but most of the people who support UASF would either not agree that it is a hard fork or would say that it is the miners that don't follow UASF who are the ones hard forking.
@_date: 2017-07-04 12:58:52


Yes. A contentious minority-hashpower UASF is more dangerous than a hard fork, because of the threat of a long reorganization. With a hard fork, there is no threat of a reorganization, except a reorganization of the side initiating the hard fork (and then only *if* the hard fork doesn't implement reorg protection).
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:52:59


That's fine, but the post I was responding to was talking about the devs, and at least one dev prefers BIP9 plus forced signaling rather than BIP8 (or at least did at one point).
Personally I'd rather we abandon versionbits entirely and go back to having version numbers mean something (I blame a lot of the current issues on versionbits), but if not that, then BIP9 is better than BIP8.
@_date: 2017-07-04 02:30:40
Could be that the exchanges are also waiting to see what happens with the segwit2x signaling. Presumably most of them are ready for BIP148 and won't ignore it completely (meaning at the least that if there's a split they'll implement some sort of replay protection and hold on to both sides just in case they both survive). But if segwit2x gets activated in time for forced signaling to start by August 1 it will be compatible with BIP148.

I'm not sure what you're talking about. Just running a node every time you want to verify a payment protects you against one thing - being defrauded by the person making that payment.
What is this "total failure" which is prevented by just running a node every time you want to verify a payment?
Sure, Bitcoin might collapse and become worthless, but an average person just running a node every once in a while for personal/small business purposes isn't going to stop that.

The prosecutors of Ross Ulbricht disagree with that.


It is ridiculous, but they do it all the time. Then they engage in parallel construction if they ever need to use the information in court. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:41:15
This seems very unlikely to be a problem. First of all, after BIP91 locks in there is a period of time before the forced signaling starts. During this time, all, or almost all, miners will start signaling segwit. Otherwise they *will* be orphaned. The vast majority (probably 95%+) will even enforce BIP91, either through running BTC1 or through patches to Core. Otherwise they have an increased chance of being orphaned.
Secondly, nodes controlled by the vast majority of hash power *are* directly connected to one another. They are directly connected to each other in multiple ways, in fact. They are directly connected to each other via the regular P2P network, using addnode or the equivalent and in many cases using nodes which only accept connections from each other. They are directly connected to each other via the FIBRE network. And they are directly connected to each other through spy mining and similar techniques.
Between these two points it's highly unlikely that any non-BIP91 chain will last more than 2 or 3 blocks.
Finally, you say, "So the network breaks into as many forks as there are partitioned 'btc1' miners until a single btc1 miner overtakes all the non-btc1 miners combined, which may not even be possible." It wouldn't be until a single btc1 *miner* overtakes the others combined. It would be until a single btc1/bip91 *partition* overtakes the other combined. And for the reasons I presented above, the largest such partition is likely to consist of a supermajority of miners.

You're comparing non-support for BIP148 to jumping off a bridge?
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:40:17
Luke has said that the BIP148 process of a UASF is superior to BIP149 for all soft forks. On this, I agree with him. (Note that I'm talking about the process of BIP148 - forced signaling, not the specific implementation - forced signaling of BIP141 on August 1, 2017.)
Hopefully segwit can be reworked to give us the most important and least controversial fixes (linear sighash scaling, fixing malleability, signing input values) and leaving the more controversial changes (script versioning, segregation of signatures in the merkle tree, and especially the signature discount) to a separate soft fork. If so, I'd support a BIP148-style activation of the former changes a year after deployment (*if* miners refuse to signal by that time).
The biggest problem with BIP148 is what you pointed out above: "Doing a UASF in ~6 months is really really pushing it as-is, and on top of that BIP148 wasn't ever going to be included in Core (due to its high probability of failing), and people didn't start pushing it in earnest until a couple months ago." These are not problems with the idea of BIP148. Rather they are problems with the specific execution. A BIP148-style activation which takes place after a year (if and only if miners don't activate first) and *is* included in Core would not have this problem.
In my opinion, the other problem with BIP148 is that BIP141 really does contain some controversial, and in my opinion unnecessarily controversial, changes. The discount, particularly the fact that it gives a worst-case cost of 400% but an average-case benefit of 120-200%, is particularly pernicious to those who want to see Bitcoin scale on-chain. There are multiple ways to fix that problem. One is to impose a total block size limit of 200% of the base block size. Another is to impose a per-tx limit of 200% (or 250%). Another is to do away with the discount entirely. Personally I prefer the latter, but I'd probably be okay with any of the three. If BIP148 (and then BIP141) fails, I'd at the very least insist on some fix to this issue before I could support segwit.
There's also a problem with mining incentives due to the segregation of signature data which was pointed out by Peter Todd months ago and was talked about in a talk by Peter Rizun more recently. The cleanest way to fix this would be with a hard fork, and that's the one I'd prefer. But it can probably be fixed adequately with a soft fork as a temporary hack.
The controversy over BIP141 may have been unnecessary. It may even have been malicious. But I think we did learn a lot over the past year, and I think we can do better than BIP141 come November 15, if BIP141 doesn't activate by then.

*Some* of them should be "fired." The ones who said they would abandon the project if they don't get their way on things like segwit or 2x, might be good candidates for that, but I'd have to see the context.
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:33:19
Okay, but the subsection I cited gives an exception: "In the case of any tax imposed by subtitle A ... If the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein and—
(i) such amount is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return, ... the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time within 6 years after the return was filed."
As far as them not being allowed to fish, I think that argument is a good one regardless of the statute of limitations issue. I would argue that the IRS has no right to get the information unless they have *individual* suspicion. I would argue that they can't just say that there's probable cause that *someone* on Coinbase might have committed a crime therefore they can get information about *everyone* with an account there. Fortunately others are arguing this for me so I don't have to personally intervene in the case. :D
My comment was only about the statute of limitations issue. If you didn't report your Coinbase trades for the years in question, don't think the statute of limitations is going to save you. In some cases it will. In some cases it won't. The 25% gross income exception is probably going to hit a bunch of people *if* the IRS gets the data in time to complete the audits and issue a 90-day letter before the 6-year deadline.
