Hi Warrior, 
I am kind of new to this AltCoin universe, just into it since 5 months but I'm "full time" so that experience is not time related, but more about things I learn in that period of time.
I went for the CPC simply because it's the one who seems to have the best potential (*time will tell) and like you said, will focus my energy on making it a success.
You got a point with the "many previous scams &amp; schemes" .. so it's a natural tendency for the masses to categorized a new coins as such, even without taking the time to explore in details .. and jump to radical conclusions *human nature huh !
Thanks for your message, that was a good hint !

At the time I’m writing this message, the CapriCoin (CPC) have the same Market Cap than LiteCoin (LTC)
See it by yourself visiting : 
*as you can see : there’s only 2 coins that separate themselves from the list.
The LTC has been launched in 2011 &amp; the CPC is not officially launched yet ... It’s quite an amazing accomplishment, don’t you think ?
Now ... The Capricoin standing at the same level than the LiteCoin, when looking at the “Market Cap”
That LiteCoin (LTC) is currently listed  in the world, according to popular site  ... In reality, the Capricoin is not correctly displayed there. Actually, it’s listed somewhere down the list when it should be right on top at  or 
I don’t know what the LTC have planned for the following weeks but I know for sure about some “soon-to-be” announcements from the CPC and it will for sure hit that  position. The question in my mind today is : “When does the CPC will reach the  position ?”
