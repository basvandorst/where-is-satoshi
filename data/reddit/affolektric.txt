Same procedure as every year: massive dip after a long side pattern before the next rallye. panic sell now and regret it in a few weeks.

They are getting more and more in trouble with user data and privacy issues (at least in Europe). So far they react with massive image campaigns. Going with Bitcoin could have a bigger impact on improving their image...so who knows :-)

What are they supposed to be? Plates?

If you drive around in a Lambo where I live (Berlin/Germany) - people either think you are a retarded drug dealer or just a retard :-)
@_date: 2019-11-12 09:26:27
I don‘t get the analogy.
@_date: 2019-11-13 21:56:20
We passed that point already...
@_date: 2019-11-13 21:35:07
Sorry - maybe I just don’t get it. I see painted Icons on a flashy background. What is „the idea“?
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:56:42
You simply sell the amount of BTC for your national currency and pay your bills &amp; grocery. It's not like all bankaccounts will instantly be shut down in an economic crisis - the massive devaluation of your national currency would be the problem. See Venezuela, Turkey, Iran, etc. Bitcoin would be your store of value - and when push comes to shove a much better one than gold or other assets cause you can always leave the country and take your savings (=private key) with you.

Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2018-10-18 14:51:22
Or you are wrong.

We are still in a bear market so retail investors are fearful and hesitate - no matter what news they get. Positive news only affect prices in a bull market. Institutions will enter in november - earliest. Have a little patience and wait till Bakkt goes live.

They are touching buttholes to look for shit? Wow...the US got some serious issues.
@_date: 2019-10-26 08:26:28
Well - this is how it started in 2017.  If the run continues like 2 yrs ago it was a smart move.
@_date: 2019-10-21 17:16:48
The drugfather.
@_date: 2019-10-29 04:06:44
Why did you sell then?

All ways lead to Moon - none of them is straight though.
@_date: 2019-10-12 04:55:43
I don‘t get it...
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:32:00
How would that affect his credibility?

They forgot to add: „All coins are removed nightly from the chain“.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:10:14
yawn. yes...it’s speculation - but when you invest in a company you also speculate that its gonna be succesful and rise in value. so whats the difference?
@_date: 2019-06-05 09:44:05
Really? I never missed that product in my life before - seems like the real world use is being artificially created. (Which is of course the same with most products.)
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:12:50
I am in crypto since 2014 and it feels like every few years India, Russia and China announce that they are banning crypto. Prices drop afterwards. And a few months later rise to new ATHs. And every time someone finds out that government officials of those countries are hodling crypto...

I read this argument a lot lately. Of course the future hasn't been written yet - but everything in the world can be described in patterns. We can pretty accurately predict what the weather will be next friday based on past patterns and present data.
@_date: 2019-12-18 09:15:26
What do you suggest then?  Just wait and see?
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:13:43
thank you. i guess there is just a lot of new people around that never experienced the rollcoaster before. there hasen’t been a single bull market in crypto without frequent drops.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:27:22
You are right - I thought institutions would rather invest than sell by now
@_date: 2018-11-04 14:49:00
Sounds more like you heaviliy invested a year ago...
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:35:39
I am not saying it will repeat - just that you shouldn't predict anything in crypto from charts. In 2017 not a single person (at least on reddit, tradingview, etc.) expected the move from 5k to 20k.
What do you expect?
@_date: 2018-11-05 00:17:44
Every downvote = someone who invested around ATH I guess. I feel sorry for you - just study market cycles and stay positive!
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:07:56
**Never.** 
Check the BTC chart one year ago. The price went from **7.250$** on 9th of november to **5.350$** on 12th of november. **That was a 2000$ dip in 3 days.** 
A month later the price went up to 18.000$
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:16:30
1 BTC on 9th of november 2017 ==&gt; **7.250$**
1 BTC on 12th of november 2017 ==&gt; **5.350$**  *(me panic-selling half of my stack)*
1 BTC on 16th of december 2017 ==&gt; **18.000$**

Unlikely you'll get banned if you know the truth and proove it's not your personal speculation...
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:09:16
Why do OTC trades have no effect on price? 
@_date: 2018-11-04 18:41:12
�� Ripple bashing is so unnecessary. The major cryptos will either make it or break it together. Don't waste so much energy on turf wars...
@_date: 2018-11-01 02:06:50
Check previous cycles - it looked like that a couple of times before. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:49:37
Let's say you hope it will die rather than expecting it. I won't downvote your opinion - I am sincerely curious where it comes from. 
Is it a general reluctance towards anarchy? Do you know anything about it, or have you been taught by your parents, friends, teachers that its a bad thing? Anarchy does not mean chaos or abscence of order - that is a misconception. It simply favors autonomous self-organization over leadership, management, or authority - which is much more natural to this world (e.g. physics, chemistry, biology, sociology...)
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:08:45
Thanks for your answer - I agree that there is no self-organisation without leadership.
@_date: 2018-11-04 00:43:50
Are you sure?

Seriously? A city made of concrete and advertisement? Imo thats a dystopian nightmare. I guess this is so true: 
@_date: 2018-11-05 00:22:03
I can do that - PM me!
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:19:36
Meaning? That they wait longer before selling?

 �� It's butter called Bitcoin or what?! Damn - do I have to be a U.S. citizen to get the joke?
