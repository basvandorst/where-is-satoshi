The is a startup in cyprus that is doing the very same thing - they are call easycoin, search it. 
With regards to the money laundering - no one and I mean no one launders more money then, HSBC, wells fargo, jpmorgan and bank of america. 
If the investors cannot see the opportunity that bitcoin represents in light of the wide spread corruption of the financial system - you should really evaluate your bizpartners. There may be a better team outthere for you. Look oversees - the real boom will be there - here in america there is much to lose. 
Good luck buddy!

They came out with their own payment plataform too. It eould be smart to integrate a bitcoin option for merchant$.

The issue here is that the alledge bitcoin manipulation or money laundering is miniscule and microscopic if we comparate with the well documented manipulation of all the markets in the planet.
London Waile
HSBC and wellsfargo laundering for drugloards.
The 2008 morgage fraud.
Robo signing.
The bailout of big banks.
Manipulation of gold and silver - ask the Germans when will they get their gold.
The emberasment of paying insurance companies for... everything, house, car, life, and even death. So then our lives be especulated with in ponzi esqueme that we know is the stock market.
Do i have to go on? 
Im not really sure what planet he is living in - sure as hell is not earth.

Buy some. Silver has nowhere to go but up. Hold on to your bitcoins too, they will go to the moon as well.

It is evident that the autorities disagree on what is bitcoin. When it comes to enfocing the laws on money laundering they recognize bitcoin as a currency and excersice the power to incarcerate people. How come no one at HSBC has been charged with money laundering. Its a documented fact they launder 8billion dollars for drug cartels. This guy is a kiddo compare to the bankers. His omly sin is to be bright as hell and not be the CEO of wells or jpmorgan. 
Sad that we are locking away ojr brightess minds in the world - we could really use them to help us get out of the mess we are in. 
Lets this make us a stronger community in the crytocurrency world.

that and much more! Can you imagine?

I have concur, it can very well catapult them into prosperity and a new renassce. After all a new renasscense comes after any crisis and a huge crisis is coming.

 Even though I may had said it differently, what is being address here is a resonable question - what is what we as a community want and ambition bitcoin to be? Because cryptocurrencies is the closest thing to a real vote in choosing what we want our future world to be. Hence their potential.
This  is a great opportunity! Can we make a voting/feedback crypto that creates a new foundation - we need hardwork and hashpowef. It can be use as an altertive voting systems for any purpose.

What do you mean?

I read the article yesterday. Biz insider has no idea wtf they are talking about.  Their organization depends on them not understanding what bitcoin is.

Bitcoin cannot be stop. Only if the users decide not use it then it will stop.

Where is the link to that headline

Who is behind the effort?
@_date: 2014-01-28 07:51:11
Wells Fargo is a financial institution that has sistematically engage in money laundering - on what moral grounds does wells fargo intends to lead this conversation? 
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:01:28
Banksters should procecuted for their financial terrorism. Bitcoin cannot be regulated.
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:17:23
Math is a bitch. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:02:17
Regulators and those who cater to them are wasting their life energy discussing what is irrelevant. Of course bitcoi  does not fit todays society, duh! 
Bitcoin will transform the world regarless of whatever regulation. Its like they are trying stear a tsunami waive. Ask the japanese and the people of indonisia. 
Cryptocurrencies are like the moob they aint going nowhere.

The dollar and most currencies used to be backed by Gold. Now is backed by guns. 
Watch this to get a better understanding of fiat money (fiat latin for faith)
Let us know what you think.

What im saying is that the banking system does and has done infinate far more damage and the prosecurors have dare not touch them with a 10 foot stick. There is no balance on that and balance is a good thing. Things go better for everyone - and that is how we progress and, literally will reach the stars. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 14:18:15
Who knows! But it would not be surprising to find out it was done.
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:07:36
Bitcoin at the post office would inhaliate western union and money grand. It would make a whole new generation a customer base for life.  
I just cannot see anyway that the post office would be allowed to do this.  There are plans for the post office already and they do not include saving it.
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:03:36
Yeah, this guys have got no clue.
