Use your phone to take your id pictures for GDAX, works much better. If that is your confirmation problem.

Yeah...but you don't know his wife either. He could explain all that and everything and she'll say "okay" but completely ignore everything. Sometimes when people have dollar signs in their eyes they get greedy and selfish. 
I have this problem with my girlfriend. I told her my good friend was gay and not to tell anyone, it's incredibly important and not her place to out him. She said she understood but instantly every time we were out with other people her first thing she would say was that he was gay. Some people cannot handle secrets.

Use your phone! The pictures my computer camera takes isn't good enough to validate the credentials.

There's not many other investments that will give you this return right now. No stock, no savings account. If you have 2 btc then chances are you've already profited nicely.

That's fair enough, guess I kinda glanced over that. I was just responding to the second part.

Put in what you're comfortable with. Remember there is a fee every transaction so if you want to avoid paying too many fees then I would put in enough that it is worth the fee. With coinbase you're paying 2.99 whether you put in $100 or $200 so I stay in that range, or you can deposit money into your UDS wallet and sign up for GDAX and make trades for a substantially lower fee. I'd suggest watching Youtube videos to learn a lot of the basics.

You spend $50 which is just a fraction of 1 bitcoin. Since 1 btc is= $5650 you take $50/$5650 so you get 0.00885 of a bitcoin. Take that number (.00885) and times that by the current btc price and you get how much your fraction of a bitcoin is worth. Hope that helps.
Edit: fixed numbers.

200 dollars is a lot more affordable than I thought.
