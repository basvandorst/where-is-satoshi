Yes it may be possible.  The system would have to incentivize people to lock away their coins when the value/exchange rate falls.  Locking up coins would effectively shrink the money supply.  When the value/exchange rate rises, the opposite would happen.  Coins would be released from lockup and/or more coins would be issued.  The effect would be to inflate the supply of money to keep the value of the coins from rising to much.
The draw back is that there may be ways to game such a system.  Lots of though would have to be given make the system hard to game.

What happens when Bitcoin becomes so popular that 10k transactions per second go through it?  If the receiving entity has to check every address that would mean scanning 13 billion transactions for every year bitcoin is operational.  To be efficient, the payer would have to notify the payee, and by the simple fact that the payee checks with a central repository for a particular key would notify that repository that the payee and the payer may be linked.

RE: "Fractional Reserve Banking" I proposed (some time back) using block chains where the "bank" signs a string of transactions and also signs messages to indicate ownership of various wallets on the BTC block chain as proof of 100% reserves.  Everyone can see the transactions going into the "banks" ledger, but cannot easily associate an address ("account number") with who owns what, but they can verify the banks ledger against the banks Bitcoin block chain wallet.  No more fractional reserve trickery.

There is a whole movement revolving around the legality of income tax.  While these people have pointed out how people are not legally liable for income tax because the Federal government cannot use direct taxation except in the case of a few items (like tobacco), the courts have proven to be corrupt and will contort the law in favor of taxation.  Also, while their arguments are valid, the average citizen zombie cannot grasp the legal exit from the system.  Thus, no matter how legal it is to not pay income taxes, you risk violence from state agencies if they decide you are a fish worth frying with no support from the general population.
With this put forth as a given reality, you then have to ask yourself what will happen if Bitcoin is promoted for such use.  We already have lots of posts on and other movements in the U.K. regarding equitable taxation of the rich.  I think stepping out and claiming that Bitcoin will allow tax evasion is another black eye that may allow the state to stamp out Bitcoin if played in the media in the correct way.
I would discourage using Bitcoin for tax evasion at this point.  The first battle must be with the zombie hoards that cannot think through the legal exits that already exist.  Pay the beast (preferably as little as possible), but make sure you get a pound of his flesh by beating him up on the internet (expose him as the abomination that he has become).

Interesting stuff, but I still have a few questions.
If the coins are sent to a side chain, the code of the side chain will have to be able to verify that the coins were sent to the side chain, thus it will have to know about the Bitcoin protocol/block chain.  That's a given.
However, if you do the reverse, and need to send the coins back to the Bitcoin block chain, the bitcoin core code will have to "know" about that particular "side chain".  Thus for every new side chain, there's going to be some sort of code in the bitcoin core to follow that side chain and verify that the coins in the side chain are 1. locked, and 2. represent the correct new owner.
This seems like a lot of dangerous work to the bitcoin core for each side chain.  Am I missing something?

A year or so back I was suggesting a standardized [guaranteed transaction fee schedule](
The basic idea is that blocks will be required to use transactions that meet these requirements or face delays by nodes supporting the block chain, and thus possibly lose their mining effort.
* The algorithm would attempt to accomplish the following:
* Charge higher fees for larger transactions.
* Charge a lower % on larger transactions.
* Charge lower fees for smaller transactions.
* Charge a higher % on smaller transactions.
* Account for increased value of bitcoins.
The average percentage fee would be .1% or lower.  Lint (super small transactions) would face a transaction fee of like a nickle, whereas the larger transactions would face transaction fees of 50 cents or more.  **Note that this does not prevent the miners from adding transactions that don't meet these standards, rather they are rules that specify what transactions "should be" included to avoid delays in block acceptance.**  A million dollar transaction contain a 25 cent transaction fee would not meet the standard, but the transaction would most certainly be accepted simply because most transaction fees are usually much lower.

It is very difficult to hide what addresses you have.  If you spend coins from your wallet to someplace like overstock.com, there is a potential to attach coins to you and your physical location.  At that point, if you send to a stealth address, no-one can figure out who you sent them to... as long as the entity receiving the coins is careful about how they spend the coins.  
Imagine the following:  You buy something from overstock.com and tie coins to you through the purchase.  Then you decide to send a few coins to Edward Snowden to assist in his legal defense using a stealth address.  At this point, the send is still private and no-one can see where the coins went.  However, if Snowden then sends the coins to his legal defense through a public address, then the privacy is broken and anyone doing analysis can see that the coins you sent ended up tied to Snowden's lawyer.  
Conclusion: Stealth addresses put your privacy in the hands of the party receiving the coins, whereas, zero coins, puts that power in your hands.

Was going to suggest something similar to this, but this is close enough that I would vote for this.  Exchange holds BTC and funds that everyone can cross check.  Parties looking to trade would sign their trades, and the "miners" would verify and assign the executions.  The "exchange" would simply hold the BTC and cash, and then sign transactions indicating which address in the BTC block chain got funds, and some sort of hash of the message indicating that fiat was sent to the appropriate banking institution.  Miners would record client request for funds and the "exchange's" response to those requests.  Everyone would still have to trust the "exchange" with holding and sending funds.

It's been a while since I've posted here.  Back in '12 (13'?) I posted an idea to make the transaction calculation fixed.  It would be something like .05% + .05% of the average transaction amount.  This would discourage the spamming and place some downward pressure on the block size.  The average transaction amount would be calculated on the first send to addresses for the last 100 or 1000 blocks.  If there are more than two send to addresses then the the sum of all the send to addresses minus the last one.
If the average transaction amount is ~$100 and the transaction amount is ~$1, then the transaction fee is 100 x .0005 + 1 x .0005 = .0505 (a little over 5 cents).  Discourages spam.
If the average transaction amount is ~$100 and the transaction amount is $10,000, then the transaction fee is 100 x .0005 + 10,000 x .0005 = $5.05.  $5 to send $10k is not bad, and the amount gives funds to the miners and or network to support other transactions.
In these examples, the highest percentage fees would be those that are super small (relative to the average transaction size).  5 cents on a $1 transaction is 5%.  This encourages people to make transactions as large as possible, but at the same time make the big transactions still support most of the network.

There are plenty of things to "restrict".  If people can be convinced that agencies can regulate Bitcoin, then all sorts of laws can be written to justify looking for and monitoring Bitcoin.  I can think of a few:
* Law requiring Bitcoin clients in the U.S. to be registered with the IRS.
* Law allowing monitoring of home computers for the presence of Bitcoins.
* Police are justified in confiscating computers and storage devices if you are suspected of holding Bitcoins without reporting them.  (Think about the current drug laws and how people are jailed for just having a few joints.)
* ISP's would be required to monitor your internet traffic to report Bitcoin transactions to the IRS.
* Permits would be required for use of encrypted communications.
All this depends on people viewing Bitcoin as something that government can regulate, and asking for "standardization" is only a small step down that path.  It is best to keep Bitcoin out of that sphere of "standardization".

There is an inherent need for stability in any currency, no matter if it is fiat, or gold and silver.  Also, dollar-cost averaging over the last month would provide wonky results, not to mention the need to either change your BTC price constantly or tie it to the exchange value. 
Basically, while it is cool to see a drastic rise in the exchange rate for BitCoin, this roller coaster is not good for the fundamental growth of BitCoin.  What is needed is to get the emotional speculation off of MtGox and other quick trading exchanges, so that there can be gradual and sustainable ("organic") growth.

Quick run ups in value are not reflective of organic growth.  That is, the number of people willing to exchange products and services for BitCoins.  Quick run ups in value is a reflection of speculation.  That is, the expectation that the value will continue to quickly rise.  A quick run up in value is also destructive to the long term use of BitCoin and its exchange value will eventually plummet back down to the organic value.  [I've stated the reason for a slow growth before](
"People need to have confidence that the value of a currency will not drastically change from one day to the next.  Small fluctuations of say 2 or 3% over a weeks time may be acceptable, but huge swings like say 10% over a weeks time limit the uses.  Here are some examples:
* Merchants have to update their prices daily to reflect the change in currency value.
* If a merchant accepts a currency while it is in it's boom phase, he/she would have to account for a bust phase and would have to quickly exchange the currency for a more stable storage of value.
* If a manufacturing firm has a profit margin of say 10%, a currency that fluctuates say 10% in a weeks time throws all their production schedules out of whack.  Again such situations would lend themselves to sell in BitCoins, but exchange back to a more stable form of money.
The whole point of a currency is that people want an easy way to think of pricing something without having to account for inflation or deflation.  For example, when you think of the price of eggs, do you think in BTC or dollars?  Yes, you could put a BTC price on the eggs, but you would first have to go look up the value of BTC first.  If you did not have to think about the value of BTC and had confidence that the value would not change drastically from month to month, then you could start thinking... "Oh... 1 dozen eggs is worth about 0.32 BTC." without pulling out your calculator.
That is not to say some types of sales can benefit from using BitCoins, even when the price fluctuates.  Here are some that are "tolerant" to BTC fluctuations.
* People for hire on a temporary basis.
* Online services such as VPN, DNS, Porn, etc.
* Second hand sales and used goods.
* Farmer's markets.
All these would look at a fluctuation of say 10% and say "Meh... close enough.", and in the case of online services it is even better because the hassle and worry of dealing with third parties is eliminated.
So again, the more stable the value over time, the more useful it is as a means of exchange."

"deserved to get robbed." is a bit harsh and implies that it is "just" to rob someone "dumb".  If you catch a thief who steals from retarded people, you don't pat the thief on the back and say "good job".  However, getting robbed when you don't learn from other's mistakes is simply a natural consequence.  We can only shake our heads and say "we told you so".
On a side thought:  I think people gravitate to my statement because there is a common dilemma in funding scammers.  By giving (and loosing) your money to a scammer, you fund bad elements in society which then tend to get more sophisticated and powerful.  Hence there is rage against those who are "gullible" enough to fall for the simplest of scams and we want to blame the victim for making a stupid mistake.

Gold is different from bitcoin in valuation.  BitCoin has a very rigid method of expansion, where gold has an on demand method of expansion.  (NOTE: Expansion does not always equate to inflation.  It is simply the increase in the supply of a currency.)  When I say on demand, I mean that when the value of gold goes up high enough, labor and resources will be diverted into mining gold until the value goes down again.  BitCoin on the other hand, continues to churn out coins even when the demand for the currency goes down.  BitCoin also fails to increase the number of coins it churns out when the demand surpasses the supply and the production.


Yes, the value of gold fluctuates quite a bit, and suffers from manipulation, just as BitCoin does.  Again, however, a prolonged high gold value, would eventually cause the mining industry to spin up new mines to meet demand, and eventually push the price back down.


This may be the case.  I would love to see what the U.K. and Greece media has been saying about BitCoin.  I suspect that there is a lot of media bringing more attention to BitCoin.  As long as people are clear headed and don't get overly excited, this is a good thing.

It is an incremental step in the fight for "mindshare".  "Petitioning" implies that the agency you are petitioning grants some sort of benefit, and thus has the "right" to grant the "benefit".  If we "petition"/beg for that "benefit" it is almost implied that the agency in question has the "right" to "sanction" Bitcoin as a currency.  From there the agency can start imposing regulations for the granted "benefit".
It is simpler to assume that we don't need permission or sanctions to do what we are doing.  Thus we should not be petitioning for anything.  We have the right to barter with whatever we please.

Incorrect.  Gold and silver have a self correcting mechanism as with other things used as currency.  For example, when the trade value of gold becomes high enough, more people would go mine for gold because it was more profitable than doing other things.  As more gold entered the market, less people mined for gold.  The same can be said for silver or other things used as currency.

I'm estimating by the % volatility per time.  The higher the volatility the less usable the currency becomes and thus meaning that the organic value is somewhere well below the current valuation.

I've had a few ideas about how to deal with the bandwidth and storage problems.
1. Limit the number of transactions by setting transaction fees higher and higher until the number of transactions reach a specified number per block (on average).
2. If the transactions fall below a particular number per block, let the price per transaction decrease back.
3. To compensate for the increased costs per transaction, third party "banks" would be used to facilitate transactions without burdening the block chain.  When customers want their funds written back to the block chain, they would pay the current block transaction fee to do so.
4. Trusted third party entities would create physical coins with the public key's and hidden private keys so that payments don't require an electronic transaction.
5. Ripple pay would become popular for bitcoin payment.  Most transactions would occur outside of the block chain in the ripple system, and balances would be settled to the block chain infrequently.  Ripple systems would thus take up the slack of the bloated block chain.

The totality of coins does matter.  If there is a 10 million coins in existence, and the total capacity for generating coins below the electricity costs is only 100,000 per year, then you only expand the coins in circulation by 1% per year.  On the other hand if the total capacity for generating coins below the electricity costs is 2million coins per year, then you are facing an expansion of 20% per year.  If the demand is not to counter act that expansion, then you will have inflation of 20%.


Not if the demand is above the production.  If the expansion rate is at 10% per year, and the production cost below electricity cost is only 5%, then you have deflation of 5%.  In other words, production cannot keep up with demand.


This method is the closest I can think of.

Gibberish.  If you think my idea has merit, use it.  If you think it is rubbish, ignore it.


An idea can have an impact when two conditions are met:
1. Someone spends enough time and resources to communicate the message to a large number of people in an eloquent way.
2. A large number of people accept the idea and act on it.
I can control the first (to the degree of my time and resources), but not the second.  The second condition is only significant if it generally has merit with those receiving the message.  To believe that you can impact number two by sheer force of will is delusional.

The drug trade is hundreds of billions, or trillions of dollars.  Laundering money through bitcoin that only has a market cap of around 130 million is just not possible.


Yes Bitcoins are much more private than banking, but Bitcoin will fail at protecting those intent on illegal trade.
But there's a bigger picture at play.  Namely, the money system is corrupt and empowers wars (via "borrowing"/printing), and enslaves countries via debt.  A system so powerful will want an excuse to ban bitcoin.  Don't give it to them.  Make them pay politically for banning bitcoin.

It would still be stable relative to energy costs.  However, if energy costs shot up drastically along with currency demand, you would see a strong increase in value.


No authority.  The algorithm would be set to dispense coins in each block according to the block difficulty.  If the block difficulty increases, so does the number of coins per block.  If the difficulty decreases, so does the number of coins per block.  The rest is based on self interest of the miners and how much electricity it would take to solve blocks and what the exchange rate is.  A more efficient miner would continue to produce coins so long as the exchange rate was higher than his production costs.

The way I sort of see it, is that the organic value is a trampoline. (One that would normally slowly rise if it were not for speculators.)  If you jump up to 6.7 when the equilibrium is around 5.10 to 5.25, then when the speculators panic and sell, it will push through the equilibrium point downward, and then the "organic" value would push it back up, and the speculators would try to trade the wave.  As the speculators loose interest, the value settles back to an equilibrium point.  That is why I think it will go to at least 4.7 or 4.5 before being pushed back up by organic and speculative interests.
I really wish we could identify the main source of this speculative interest so we could could point out the drawbacks to running up the price.

You've edited your post drastically which makes it difficult to respond.  I reposting here before more changes happen.




As stated in my post prior to your edit, "The number of BitCoins produced is inflexable. If more people mine, it does not change the rate of output."








OK. Your behavior has now convinced me sufficiently, that you are engaging in selective thinking.
You are, indeed, singling out Bitcoin, by emphasizing risks inherent in all currencies and pretending they are problems only for Bitcoin, and then by emphasizing positive attributes inherent in certain currencies and pretending that Bitcoin doesn't enjoy those positive attributes. You did the first when you claimed that Bitcoin bubbles are possible while neglecting to mention that bubbles are possible all other currencies; when I responded to that, you changed the subject. You did the second when you claimed that gold and silver have a self-corrective mechanism that Bitcoin does not have (a falsehood, since Bitcoin also has the same corrective mechanism).
Since your statements product of selective thinking seem to be obviously counterfactual, it is likely to conclude that you will not be persuaded by anything I say, no matter how hard the evidence I present to you is. Thus, this conversation is futile.
Apparently, three other people agree with me, so it's fair to observe that I gave you a chance to explore the issue with me, but you deliberately didn't take it.
See you around!
By all means, explain your position.  Why is my thinking incorrect?  I'm here to share a perspective and learn.
As noted earlier, you edited much of your post, which makes it difficult to respond.  I'm not being closed minded, rather your hostility is baffling.  I'm pointing out that the rate of BitCoin production is fixed and inflexible.  This is relevant to bubbles because when demand for the currency goes up, there is no way to increase production to counter the bubbles.  Even government sponsored currencies attempt to print more to avoid deflation.  I believe inflexible supply that does not respond to demand is a deficiency in anything used as a currency.

A truly untraceable money system would make state power impossible.  Crime of the type you are taking about is just one aspect.  If you take this particular crime to the next level, there is the possibility that no-one would want to be a politician, as everyone you piss off would put a bounty on your head.  (Go ask about game scenarios where you can bet on how long a politician will live.) However, BitCoin is very traceable at the moment, and such crime is not yet possible, and I hope it will not be so until such time as it is well established as an exceptable form of exchange.

If it is obvious that a major pool or organization is taking advantage of the 51% problem by allowing some parties to double spend, then eventually the coders of BitCoin will install some sort of reputation filter to recognize reputation and delay blocks sent from IP's or identities that have poor or low reputation.
The 51% problem is solvable.

People need to have confidence that the value of a currency will not drastically change from one day to the next.  Small fluctuations of say 2 or 3% over a weeks time may be acceptable, but huge swings like say 10% over a weeks time limit the uses.  Here are some examples:
* Merchants have to update their prices daily to reflect the change in currency value.
* If a merchant accepts a currency while it is in it's boom phase, he/she would have to account for a bust phase and would have to quickly exchange the currency for a more stable storage of value.
* If a manufacturing firm has a profit margin of say 10%, a currency that fluctuates say 10% in a weeks time throws all their production schedules out of whack.  Again such situations would lend themselves to sell in BitCoins, but exchange back to a more stable form of money.
The whole point of a currency is that people want an easy way to think of pricing something without having to account for inflation or deflation.  For example, when you think of the price of eggs, do you think in BTC or dollars?  Yes, you could put a BTC price on the eggs, but you would first have to go look up the value of BTC first.  If you did not have to think about the value of BTC and had confidence that the value would not change drastically from month to month, then you could start thinking... "Oh... 1 dozen eggs is worth about 0.32 BTC." without pulling out your calculator.
That is not to say some types of sales can benefit from using BitCoins, even when the price fluctuates.  Here are some that are "tolerant" to BTC fluctuations.
* People for hire on a temporary basis.
* Online services such as VPN, DNS, Porn, etc.
* Second hand sales and used goods.
* Farmer's markets.
All these would look at a fluctuation of say 10% and say "Meh... close enough.", and in the case of online services it is even better because the hassle and worry of dealing with third parties is eliminated.
So again, the more stable the value over time, the more useful it is as a means of exchange.

As it stands, mining pools are centralizing the network.  If they become the main source of data, then there are potentials for abuse.  A better approach might be to figure out a mechanism whereby those who don't mine can be rewarded for storing portions of the block chain or the full block chain so that it is more difficult to cheat.

To be more precise, inflation is the decrease in purchasing power of a currency, whereas currency expansion is the addition of currency (printing/mining) into the system.  The Fed could print lots of dollars without inflation, if the demand for dollars is outpacing the rate of printing.  In the case of Bitcoin, the rate of expansion per year is currently around 25% (50 BTC every 10 minutes... = 2.63 million... and 10.4 million in circulation), but there is actually deflation (an increase in purchasing power) for Bitcoin.

Paper elections are much harder to rig without someone being aware that something strange is going on.  You basically have monitors from the various candidates in question observe.
Source code does you no good unless you can also verify every piece of hardware.  So, for example, you could hijack the keyboard or touch screen to have it vote something else.  Also, since we are talking about elections, it is conceivable that a special CPU or other IC's be created that would allow injection of new code.
Basically, the more technology you introduce and the complexity involved, the easier it is to rig (if the objectives are worth rigging).

See steps 5 and 6 to solve the problem.  Basically, I'm suggesting a change to the protocol so that coins in a fast spend can still be retrieved, but only after 24 hours (or some delay period) without the third party signature.  This would be a no risk scenario for the coin owner, merely an inconvenience if the third party fails to sign the coin send operation.
@_date: 2012-06-13 14:55:16
Yes.  In my original statement, I took that into account.  It would be one of the drawbacks.  As technology improves efficiency of mining, there would be inflation.  However, if the pool of coins was large enough, improvements in technology would be minimal.  For example, if the system had been running for years and some new technology comes along to cut the coin price in half, but the hardware produced could only produce 5% more coins per year if running 24/7, then the impact would be minimal.  (e.g. 5% inflation, because the number of existing coins is so large, the number of new coins is small in comparison).

Basic strategy:
1. Police don't have to ship drugs to your house through a fake Silk Road ad.  They can simply use the ad to obtain the address.
2. Once the address has been established, get a warrant to search packages to establish that drugs are being shipped.  Alternatively use a drug sniffing dog to detect which packages are drugs.
3. Let multiple drug shipments go through to establish a pattern.  Don't try to arrest on the first package, that would be stupid.
4. On the 3rd or 4th package, execute the search warrant.
So what is a suspect going to say... "Oops, I opened those other 2 packages but I forgot to call the police."

Don't get to excited.  This service excludes tainted coins.  Excluding coins that are "tainted" is becoming the norm.  This will eventually cause problems down the line.  As long as some coins are greater in value than other coins, people will tend to avoid BitCoin for fear of getting "bad/tainted" coins.
At one point, I sent two sets of coins (~100) to a wallet that was compromised.  I saw the first batch of 50 go through and then it was quickly drawn against.  As soon as I realized the wallet was compromised, I waited minute by minute until the second batch was confirmed.  Then quickly sent the other 50 back to my main wallet, before the thief got the second batch as well.  
Now, because the first batch of ~50 went to a hacker that stole the wallet, and the second set went back to my main offline wallet, my main offline wallet is now slightly tainted, yet I'm the victim that lost ~50.

Are stocks meant to be a form of currency?  Volatility basically means that the market is having a hard time putting the correct value on the item.  Stocks with super high P/E ratios where the future earnings are speculative, tend to have volatile pricing.  Volatility in stocks does not mean the stock is grossly under or over priced, because the high P/E ratio may be justified given the potential of a company.
I've stated in other posts why volatility is bad for a currency and degrades its usefulness.  The whole purpose of a currency is to function as 1.) a store of value, and 2.) a means of exchange.  BitCoin easily meets the second, but is failing on the first because people cannot get a good estimate on its value.  Therefore, high volatility in a currency means people are speculating on it's value rather than trading with it.  Thus, I believe BitCoin to be overvalued at the moment.

If you are familiar with bitcoin, you know that about every 10 minutes 50 more bitcoins are produced.  At the end of this year, the number of coins produced will decrease to 25 coins every 10 minutes.  More people mining does not change this rate of output.


In fact, if you want to have any further interaction with me, I am going to ask you to prove pretty much every claim you make. It's not my responsibility to refute you. It is your responsibility to prove yourself correct.
On top of that, there is another error in your claim (TLDR: just because the output rate might be fixed, does not imply that there is no self-correction mechanism). I will point this other error out extensively, as soon as you substantiate your claims.

There is a "momentum" factor.  When people have lots of money tied up in an investment and they see the value of that investment drop, they panic and sell.  So, if everyone is watching the price and overly emotional, all you have to do is to dump enough to push the price down, say 10%, and the rest of the market will panic and sell down another 40%.  This is why I've been telling people purchasing only a small number of BTC that would not be missed if the price goes to zero.  Those who put 100% of their assets into BTC end up on an emotional roller coaster and panic sell when things go the wrong way.

If it were to "take off" it would eventually contract and detract from it's usefulness as a currency.  What is needed is gradual continuous use and acceptance.  At the current rate of BTC being generated, BitCoin is "expanding" at about 33% per year, and that "expansion" will drop to 12.5% next year.  Since the exchange rate is holding at around $5, this means that either someone is holding the exchange rate steady at about $5 or use is expanding by about 30% per year.
It is going to take many years for BTC to become accepted.  Quick run up in the exchange rate will destroy its usefulness.

I've been considering the problem, and scripts may solve the problem.  
1. Send your coins to a double signed address.
2. In order to spend the coins, you and a trusted third party must sign to get the coins free.
3. You can still get your coins back if the trusted third party does not sing for the coins, but it takes 3 to 7 days for them to clear.
4. When you sign a message to release your coins to a merchant, the trusted third party will also sign the transaction.
5. The trusted third party cannot spend the coins without the buyers signature.
The idea is this... by using a trusted third party, the seller can rest assured that the coins in question will not be double spent and can release his goods as soon as he sees the message from the trusted third party, and even before it reaches the block chain.  The seller can also be sure that the buyer cannot do anything with the coins in question for 3 to 7 days unless the third party will sign the transaction.  **Thus, so long as the third party has a good reputation, the coins will not be double spent while while the transaction is waiting to be recorded in the block chain.**
1. Coins would have to be pre-loaded in this fashion by the buyer beforehand.
2. If the third party does not sign the message, the buyer still gets the coins after 3 to 7 days, but the transaction would be in limbo until that time.
3. If the third party is not reputable, he could conspire with the buyer to double-spend... e.g. Sign the transaction, but then sign another transaction to a different address when the buyer sends another transaction to a different address.  The seller would not get bitcoins for the goods or services.
4. The third party would have to have a server on the network someplace that would be churning out signatures all the time.  Thus, this third party would have to charge a small fee for this service of quick signing.  Otherwise, the buyer and seller would have to wait 3 to 7 days for the transaction to clear.

I'm talking about privacy, not security.  There are four things that can be used in the block chain journal to decrease privacy.
1. The time of the transaction.
2. Amount of the transaction.
3. Where the coins came from.
4. Addresses where they are sent to and from, along with browser internet history/traffic or other obtainable records.
Using these and statistical analysis associated information can be deduced.  Take the amount for example.  If the cost of a particular drug on silk road is $17.87 and the exchange rate is $10, the sending of 1.787 BTC to an address would signal a probable drug trade.  Give the time of the transaction in the block chain, and the probable shipping weight, a warrant for UPS records can be obtained for packages being shipped for that weight and date range.  Further, if the buyer is an addict, he will purchase on a regular basis, so more UPS records along with the block chain records would allow further support for a warrant to check packages being sent to a residential address.  Before long, your "private" transactions become transparent with the use of a "public" crypto currency.

If they don't keep the funds grouped with the general funds, then there is no laundering taking place.  E.G. Make an address to send funds from one customer.  If the funds look suspicious, send them back to the originator.
Another option is to require the sender to specify the address the funds are coming from before providing a destination address.  That way the funds can be pre-checked against those that are reported stolen.

The only reason the hammer has yet to fall on BitCoin is because the banks currently being exposed for the corrupt institutions they are.  However, with all the negative press and the major banks boycotting BitCoin, there is a more and more disproportional use of BitCoin for nefarious purposes.  In other words, BitCoin is being ostracized from legitimate uses by the banking system via FUD and outright blockades.  This will basically paint such a negative picture of BitCoin, that it will have little to no chance of fighting legislation being created.  The only hope is to jettison/disavow nefarious uses, and hammer home how corrupt the existing systems are.

Encryption does not matter.  Analysis of the block chain/journal allows snoops to see where the coins have been, and also to make inferences about associations and transactions.  Tie that with the internet data vacuum (AKA the Patriot ACT and the new Utah data center) and other electronic ease dropping, your transactions are much more transparent.  The only upside is that if you deal with anonymous sources that are diligent about privacy, you can be somewhat more private.
Cash is a harder to track, in that once it leaves the banking system it can circulate through several points unknown to snoops before returning to the banking system where it can be tracked again.

That is not to say the person who's running the show to start cannot be trusted with billions or even trillions, but rather the world is full of fucking sharks that use tactics such as assassination, manipulation, drugs, electronic warfare, etc.  I pitty anyone who would attempt to stand in that position.

The point of purchase is a point of weakness.  Also, randomizing does not work with analysis.  There are all sorts of pieces of information that can be gathered to identify the funds, even if it is split up all over the place.  E.G., snooping on the IP traffic, time of randomization, time coins stay in one address, average number of coins per address once they are "randomized".  Most of this is available without a warrant, and with the Patriot act, even the IP traffic does not require a warrant.

To subscribe to "might is right", one rejects the recognition of the "other" has having value and common ground to interact with.  The "others" become things to be manipulated.  The rejects all moral interaction.  That is not to say that someone the position of power can simply do as he or she will.  These things still happen.  However, by stating that "might is right", you subscribe to the idea that if you had the power, you have no moral qualms about killing or harming people.  In essence, you are saying that you have no empathy and sense of "other", and revel in the idea of your own power to do as you will.  The word "psychopathic" comes to mind.
Even the word "psychopathic" is not a justification, because there are people who don't feel empathy, but still recognize the need to interact and avoid harming others.  They do this even though they would not feel remorse for causing pain.  "Might is right" basically rejects this moral restraint and says "I'm freeing myself from any internal restraints, and will do as I please.  If I want to kill someone and can do it without consequence, I'll do it."  "Might is right" revels in the idea of manipulation and evil to achieve whatever ends are desired.

Also, given these two numbers and the current price of BTC, you can calculate the ROI (return on investment).  
Power: 20W

Cost: $580
* 300MHash/sec will yield about .22 BTC per day, or $1.43 per day, or $43.50 per month (at $6.50 per BTC).
* 20W is 14.400 KWH per month, or $1.44 per month to run (assuming you would keep your computer on anyhow, and $.1 per KWH).
* Net profit per month would be $41.06 per month.
* **ROI is around 14 months.**  (Assumes you already have a computer and normally keep it running all the time.)
GPU (AMD 5730):
Power: 180W
Hash Rate: 245 MH
Cost: $160
* 245 MHash/sec will yield about .18 BTC per day, or about $1.17, or about $35.60 per month (at $6.50 per BTC).
* 180W is 126 KWH per month, or about $12.60 per month to run (assuming you would keep your computer on anyhow, and at $.1 per KWH).
* Net profit per month would be $23 per month.
* **ROI is around 7 months.**  (Assumes you already have a computer and would simply upgrade your computers video card to do mining.)

If you are talking about investing about investing, the volatility is sort of like the balance sheet or income statement of a company.  It is an indicator of the health of a currency, just as the financial reports are an indication of the health of a company.  That is not to say a company or currency that are in poor health will not be successful.  
I see nothing wrong with "investing" in BitCoin.  Buy a bunch and hold them over a long period of time with the intent of spending them later for goods and services.  This type of activity does not hurt the fundamental value of BitCoin, rather, is slowly increases the value over time.
What I see as a problem are those who are speculating to buy one minute and sell the next to make some minuscule percentage over exchange fees.  This self referential price driven exuberance followed by frenzied panic sells, destroys the faith of the underlying currency.  Thus, if volatility is the norm, then the long term prospects are very poor.  Hence my forecast that BitCoin is currently over valued.

It is easier to trace Bitcoins vs. cash. There are four things that can be used in the block chain journal to decrease privacy/traceability.
1. The time of the transaction.
2. Amount of the transaction.
3. Where the coins came from.
4. Addresses where they are sent to and from, along with browser internet history/traffic or other obtainable records.
Using these and statistical analysis associated information can be deduced. Take the amount for example. If the cost of a particular drug on silk road is $17.87 and the exchange rate is $10, the sending of 1.787 BTC to an address would signal a probable drug trade. Give the time of the transaction in the block chain, and the probable shipping weight, a warrant for UPS records can be obtained for packages being shipped for that weight and date range. Further, if the buyer is an addict, he will purchase on a regular basis, so more UPS records along with the block chain records would allow further support for a warrant to check packages being sent to a residential address. Before long, your "private" transactions become transparent with the use of a "public" crypto currency.
Other things makes Bitcoin inferior to cash and banking with regards to drug money.
1. Bitcoin is not yet ubiquitous.  You cannot spend it everywhere yet.
2. Bitcoin is still shown in the media as being the currency for shady dealings.  Main stream media is still touting Bitcoin as a way to buy and sell drugs online.  Those with drug money are probably trying to change their billions in cash into something that appears to be more legitimate.
3. At a market capitalization of $128 million, Bitcoin simply does not have the market capitalization to wash the billions (possibly trillions) of dollars.




Bitcoins can store value, but it is not the type of "value" that drug lords are looking for.  It might happen later when Bitcoin is perceived as a legitimate method of exchange, but for those who have illicit funds, Bitcoin is not a good store of value.
**Anyway, we don't really want to give the bankers and congress an excuse to shut Bitcoin down because it is being used to launder money.**  We need to think in terms of how regulation or bans might be justified, so that if and when it happens, it will be exceedingly politically expensive to do so.

The main failing of BitCoin is that its value can bubble, and thus also crash hard.  If we were to start over, a better approach would be to create a mechanism that would flood the market as the value increases, but also decrease the currency expansion as the value decreased.  
The one proposed method of accomplishing this would be to tie the number of coins created to the hash difficulty.  Thus as the value increases, people spend more for electricity to create more coins and thus pushes the difficulty up.  There are two downsides to this, however.  
First, such a method would consume more energy than the standard BitCoin method.  When I do a rough calculation of the amount of currency in the world, it would take one to two years worth of electricity to create the equivalent value in digital coins.  With the earth already overpopulated and energy resources already tight, such a currency would cause more problems.
Second, technological advances would cause problems with inflation and more energy consumption.  This would happen because it would become cheaper to create new coins, and thus more energy would be spend to create new coins, as well as causing inflation in the money supply (when demand for such a currency is flat).

Energy consumption used for the hashrate will always consume 50 BTC (25 BTC at the end of the year) worth of electricity (on average).  So, if 50 BTC is worth $425 and electricity costs are $.1 per KWH, then 4250 KWH will be used every 10 minutes (on average).  This will be cut in half when the distribution rate falls to 25 BTC every 10 minutes.  As the value of BitCoin increases, so will the energy consumption.  Note that this does not include the resources required for mining hardware, just the operational energy costs.
You may ask: "Why does the energy consumption always match the value of BTC?"  Basically, as the value increases, more miners will opt to spend electricity mining.  This will happen until the hash rate is difficult enough to be more expensive to mine than to buy on the open market.
**The bigger picture**:
What is the cost of the dollar?  Why has it retained its value since Nixon removed the silver backing to the dollar?  It basically has to do with oil and what oil is sold for.  At the moment, oil for the most part is sold for dollars.  What happens now is a bit complicated, but basically, other countries now have to hold dollars to buy oil.  This means that dollars can be issued to the government by the Fed and the government can spend those dollars without incurring inflation in the U.S.
So, what happens when oil producing countries decide that they want to sell their oil for gold, or some other currency?  Basically, those dollars start flowing rapidly back to the U.S. and causes inflation.  Further, the government has a harder time borrowing from the Fed without causing even more inflation.  If the cycle continues, the U.S. economy goes into the crapper and U.S. dominance along with it.
What would you do if your power base depends on everyone selling oil for dollars?  The current tactic would be to "dissuade" any oil producing country from selling oil for anything but dollars.  This includes war.  In fact, if you look at the Iraq war in this light, you realize that it was the first resource war.
So, now we change the question of "What is the cost of the dollar?" to "What does it cost to 'defend' the dollar?".  Estimates are that this latest war cost around $3 trillion (that does not include the blood shed in the conflict).  In perspective, the total U.S. money supply (M1, M2, and M3) is about $14 trillion.  That means the U.S. just spent 21% of the value of the dollar just to 'defend' it.  **That's only one war!**  How many more will have to be fought in this manner?
So, what is the average cost of BTC?  It's kinda hard to calculate, but as the value of BitCoin increases, the percent of resources spent compared to the current computational costs shrinks over time.  The first BitCoins costs pennies each, then one or two dollars each, etc.  Thus far 9.5 million BTC have been created, and there's another 12 million to go (or 45%).  If BitCoin were to replace 45% or the U.S. money supply (not likely to happen very quickly), each one would be worth $660k each.  (Don't get excited, this will not happen over night.)  In other words, the current exchange of 1 BTC for $8.50 is minuscule compared to the future value.
Given that the past energy costs were so low and the time it takes to be accepted will probably be years into the future, I'm estimating that the total energy costs will be much lower than $3 trillion and the human suffering will be much less.  I say that's a much better deal than making recurring payments to 'defend' the dollar.
@_date: 2012-06-06 22:26:05
From what I've described, I agree.  It is just a matter of degrees.  As I stated near the end, there are businesses where a large fluctuation just does not matter.  However, my theory is that the wilder the BitCoin value fluctuates, the fewer businesses that can adjust or adapt to using BitCoin.  Thus we sorta have a "chicken and the egg" problem, where the more people adopt BitCoin, the quicker the run up, and thus it becomes more difficult to adjust to the BTC value.  Therefore a gradual increase in value seems like the only logical way to go for BitCoin, and to discourage short term speculation that creates exchange bubbles that decrease BTC "organic" use.

This can only happen if the bank ledger is private.  If the ledger is public (e.g. like the bitcoin chain... where the public keys are seen but private keys are used to claim ownership of the funds), then there is no way a bank could employ fractional reserve banking without everyone seeing it and quickly pulling their funds.  If the ledger is private, then, yes, a bank might get away with fractional reserve banking.
However, if the banking standard is to use the public ledger, then private ledger banking could not compete.

**There's a simpler solution for this, but it requires a third party signatory**, and a change to the protocol.  It would work like this...
1. Customer sends coins to a fast spend address that is exclusively controlled by the customer but is "fast spend" verified by a third party.
2. When the customer decides to spend the coins, the normal signature is made to spend the coins.
3. When the third party sees the transaction it will also sign the transaction, but only once for the set of coins sent to the fast spend address.
4. **If the merchant trusts that the third party will not collude with the customer to double spend, then the transaction can take place in a matter of seconds.**
5. Nodes on the BitCoin network will have to be programmed to delay transactions sent from the "fast spend" address by 24 hours unless the transaction is also signed by the trusted third party.  This will allow the customer to still spend his coins without the third party signature, but will also prevent the coins from being removed from the fast spend address while a real world "fast spend" transaction is taking place.  In other words, it enforces the third party signature to quick spend over a normal transaction. 
6. Customers can still spend their coins without the signature of the third party, but a required 24 hours delay is needed for the transaction to process instead of the normal 20 to 60 minutes.
7. **The "trusted" third party cannot spend the coins.  The only trust required is that there is no double signing of the same set of coins, and that the signature happens quickly when the customer goes to spend his coins.**

It is not difficult to determine the energy usage.  For example, the current block difficulty is 1,583,178.  If you make the number of coins generated in each block equal to 1/1000th the difficulty, then blocks generated would give 1583 coins each.  Let's assume it costs $275 in electricity to generate a block of that difficulty.  (This is a close estimate of the actual cost to generate one block at a difficulty of 1,583,178.)  That would mean it costs about $.17 per each of these new coins.  If people are willing to pay $.20 per each of these new coins, then more miners would pile on to generate more coins to sell.  This would push the difficulty up and generate more coins per block until the market becomes flooded with these coins.  This would continue to happen until demand for the new coins falls closer to $.17 each.  At this point miners would start to back off production, and the difficulty would fall, and thus the number of coins per block as well.


False.  There would be a point at which the supply would push the price down to the production cost.  At that point miners would back off production.


Possible, but not likely.  Since the supply is limited by the production cost, there is still scarcity and will probably keep it above zero.  In the example, if the value falls below $.17 each, then coin production would fall to near zero and thus the number of coins in circulation would not be increasing.  An exchange rate of zero would indicate a total abandonment of the system, beyond the normal reals of scarcity.  E.G. Internet failure, government crackdown, implementation failure, etc.
**The whole point is to expand the supply proportional to the demand by tying the number of coins produced to the energy required to produce.  This limits the upswings and speculation, but at the same time preserves scarcity by the self interest of the miners.**

No.  The number of BitCoins produced is inflexable.  If more people mine, it does not change the rate of output.

Was not trying to be patronizing.  Just trying to narrow down terms.


Subjectivity is based on perception and reason.  I perceive a problem with BitCoin in that people speculate based on the price going up and down relative to dollars.  I reason that people who actually sell goods and service would find a wildly fluctuating currency undesirable to hold or trade with.  Therefore, I believe a good subjective quality of a currency would be a stable vale even when the use is expanding.


The number of businesses or the volume of transactions would be a good way to measure it.  Perhaps even compared to GDP.


Liquidity means it is easily exchanged into other forms of value.  Right now the banking industry is fighting to keep BitCoin from taking off.  They do this by blocking transfers to MtGox and other exchange sites.  This decreases the ease of exchange to other forms of value.


What happens if your bank get's robbed?  Your funds are insured against this type of theft.  If your computer gets hacked and they get your wallet file, there is no insurance against this.


I was not aware that SolidCoin attempted to tie the number of coins generated to the block difficulty.  My understanding is that it was the same as bitcoin, but at a faster block rate and release of coins.  Did they simply say that the number of blocks generated would continue to issue 50 coins each time, regardless of how far into the future things ran?

Organic value cannot be $9 at this point.  Given how much the value is fluctuating, any vendor who sells for BitCoins would have to exchange to dollars quickly or risk a fall.  Even an hour could mean 5-10% change.  Until things settle down, I would advise against putting any large amount of money in BitCoin.  If you are in for investing, you might want to consider selling a small portion to take a profit.

It means that you cannot depend on pricing your products in BTC.  Rather, you have to price them in dollars and then provide a conversion.  Also, it can just as easily go the other way.  "free money" this time, "lost money" next time.


It does not matter if it is an old topic or not.  "Price stability" (or at least a predictable value) is important because of several reasons.
* If people think that the value of BTC will fly up quickly, they will delay purchases with BTC.
* If vendors think that the value of BTC may drop to quickly, they may charge a premium to use BTC.
* If you have to check the market price for BTC before buying things, you think in terms of dollar values instead of the number of BTC's.  This does not help the mindset for people adopting BitCoin as a means of exchange.
As I've acknowledged before, some vendors can deal with volatility, some cannot.  Volatility in a currency, undermines its use for others, and destroys its value as a currency. 
I understand everyone wants their stash of BTC to rise well above $30 per BTC, but the only way to achieve that is to either have people with deep pockets stabilizing the price or to keep people's enthusiasm in check by pointing out the obvious problems.

Actually, the U.S. constitution was centered around "coining" and setting weights and values of money.  Basically, gold and silver.  The Federal reserve act side stepped this allowing a third party create  fiat currency, and the government "borrows" in this currency in a contorted and complicated manner (I'll not go into detail here...).  The constitution does not grant the right, the entity that claims to be the government has manufactured an illusionary system that pretends to be constitutional.  Basically, there is no "right" defined in the constitution for the "government" to create fiat currency.


That's where the danger is.  If any currency replaced the dollar (irregardless of what a government declares official), then no inflation will yield value to the printer.  The beast that calls itself the "government" will do everything it can to stop this from happening.

Actually, it is the reason it cannot get wide adoption as quickly as a currency that expands with demand.  What would be ideal is that the number of coins generated is proportional to the computational difficulty.  Thus as there is a higher demand, it becomes more profitable to mine and more people spend electricity to generate coins.  Eventually, the number of coins being generated flood the market and the demand subsides.  When it becomes unprofitable to mine, the number of miners falls off, and so does the difficulty and number of coins generated.
The point here is that drastic bubbles eventually pop.  This makes it difficult for merchants to accept a new currency because they cannot be assured of its short term value (say 1 year or so).
While I would agree that limiting the number of coins will encourage people to promote BitCoin, those **merchants and customers who want to use BitCoin will find the value fluctuation to be a drawback**.  If it is any consolation, eventually production costs will cause mining to dry up to near zero, and the currency would have near zero expansion.  Also note, I use the word "expansion" as opposed to inflation.  Expansion is when the number of coins in circulation increases.  Inflation is when the value of each coin decreases.  **You can have currency expansion without inflation if the rate of expansion is below or equal to the increased demand for a currency.**

Yes, I read that,  but it only correlates two peoples experience.  Also, the Coding Horror's purchase was in October of 2009 from Crucial.  The drive controller at that time were still experiencing problems (they all used the same controller except the Intel drives).  Since then, the controller logic has been updated.  Also, his friend/associate ran through eight different SSD's and they all failed.  This makes me think his associate is doing something strange like continually running a defrag operation in the background (very bad for an SSD).
So unless we know more, it is unclear what the root problems are (e.g. improper use, or quality control).  It could also be that failures are like burn-ins... if you use your drive for x days with no problems, then it is only likely to fail because of wear problems (continual defrag, 100GB writes per day, etc.).

The core reason the U.S. is at war has to do with defending the dollar.  While BitCoin is not yet a large threat, if it gets to say a few billion in capitalization, then there is little doubt some ruse will provide a reason for throwing people in jail for using it.  If a country's governing entity is willing to go to war and kill to defend its currency, it will have very few qualms about doing the same to its citizens.

See: [The current Bitcoin economic model doesn't work]( for more information.  To be fair, I will profit if I sell now, but I don't intend to, unless my current dollar funds go to zero... in which case, I will sell (or purchase things with) only what I need to survive.

I'm not to sure where the quote comes from.  Open Transaction has mechanisms to digitally sign "contracts" and then re-assign the owner of the contract via encryption of some sort.  This contract can represent anything, but for the purposes of an exchange, the contract would represent a number of USD in electronic form.  
So let's say I'm the one that will issue a digital contract to you for $21 that you can redeem for $20.  Now this digital contract is only exclusive to me, not to you, so you can give it to whomever you please, but I'm still bound to give the bearer $20 when it is given back to me.  
Now that the value of $20 is in a digital form, programmers can now connect Open Transaction to BitCoin (I think this part is already done...).  You can now take that $20 contract and exchange it for BTC in an Open Transaction server.  (I'm fuzzy on the details of Open Transaction ATM... so forgive me if I miss some details.)  Now you own either a contract for BTC that can be redeemed or the BTC itself.
The thing about these "contracts" is that they are sort of like bank notes that were issued before the Federal Reserve was created.  A depositor would give a bank gold or silver and the bank would issue a bank note that the depositor could either redeem in the future or "spend"/give to a merchant for goods or services.  
Bank notes were popular because they were easier to carry around than the actual silver and gold.  The cool thing about the idea of Open Transaction and these contracts, is that they are digital, and digital representations of physical paper or metal can be transmitted and exchanged electronically.  So just as paper was easier to trade than gold and silver, now digital "contracts" (that act like bank notes) are easier to trade than physical paper.
EDIT: The whole drawback to all of this is that the issuer of the "contract" could issue more "contracts" than he has psychical money... just like the banks do.  This is cheating, and one of the many root problems with modern banking.  This is why BitCoin is so attractive.  Once you have BTC, you can see all the transactions and know there is no inflation.

This is what I understand:
When the internet is turned back on, the longest block chain wins and the remaining block chain transactions are disassembled and placed in new blocks.

Quick-Pay branches
Solves for:
* Provides quick method of transferring funds from one address to another.
* Standardizes methods of interacting with POS systems.
* Shows accounting of all transactions to demonstrate the banker is not cheating.
* Provides scaleablity for BitCoin.
Method of use (Customer view):
* Customer check's seller's web site to see what "bankers" he trusts to do his transactions.
* Customer sends his funds to one of these "bankers" and 30 minutes later, the funds are loaded and ready for quick spending.
* Customer visits brick and mortar shop and uses his smart phone to quick send his funds at the point of sale.
* If funds are not used after 5 days, they are returned by the QuickSpend vendor back to the original address.
Methods of use (Shop owner):
* Does research on "bank" or "quick spend" vendors.  (Fees, charges, reputation, etc.)
* Selects 1 or more "quick spend" vendors and displays their logos in his or her shop and website.
* When customer pays, funds transfer is instantaneous and appears in the "quick spend" service block chain for verification.
* Funds sitting in the QuickSpend vendor's bank for 5 or more days, are send back to the main BitCoin block chain.
Methods of use ("Quick Spend" vendor)
* Vendor uses open source branch of BitCoin to create a QuickSpend branch.
* Vendor creates a web site where he can advertise his QuickSpend branch.
* Vendor only needs to create a static web site with his BitCoin client IP and address to send funds to.
* Vendor needs to make sure static page is not hacked and does not change to redirect funds to the incorrect address or IP. (perhaps a check sum daemon that watches for changes).
* Vendor uses an offline computer to keep funds in.  Uses memory stick update offline system and send funds back to the main BitCoin branch.  Memory stick only has to be done once or twice a day to ensure funds are moved back to the BitCoin branch.
Weak points:
* Vendor trust.
* Customer must trust his smartphone has not been hacked.
* Shop owner must trust his hardware has not been hacked.
Implementation details:
* Create block chains controlled by trusted individuals or "banks".
* You send your BitCoin to a specific "bank branch", and your funds then appear in the alternative "block chain".
* Your funds are attached to the same public and private keys when you sent the funds (the bank does not know it).
* The alternative "block chain" serves as a public accounting method to show everyone what has gone into the "bank" and what has moved out.
* The QuickPay owner would take transactions sent to his server and quickly generate new blocks for the block chain to show a transfer of funds.
* Rule: Bank owner's client will move funds that have been inactive after 5 days back to the BitCoin block chain using the same addresses from the "banks" "block chain".
* Bank owner charges a small fee or percentage to handle the quick transactions. (say .25% or .05 BTC) or to move funds into or out of his "block chain"
* Change would be integrated within the BTC client and "banks" would advertise their "block chains".  Users could enter a URL to download the "bank's" "block chain".
* "banks" would advertise their services to perspective businesses along with hardware technology to take advantage of these.
* Blocks are not generated by computational problems, but rather they are signed with the vendor's public key and also contain the checksum and block number of the previous block.  (This allows the vendor's BitCoin client to quickly make new blocks.)

My understanding is the drives have 10k write limit to each block.  If the wear level logic is faulty, then it is entirely possible to quickly wear out one or two blocks and cause a drive failure.  However, if the wear logic is working correctly and moves things around on occasion, you should be able to get upward of 100 terabytes of writes to an SSD before the starting to hit the wear limits.  100 terabytes would be the equivilant of writing 3 Gigs to your hard drive from 91 years.  However, of you are writing 1 TB per day, you can expect the drive to fail in around 100 days.  I would be curious to know what application was being used when these drives failed.

At the moment this is true, and it is also why price fluctuates so much.  Hence, the value needs to be stabilized with trade in real goods and service.  BitCoins success will depend on peoples willingness to ignore the dollar value of things.  Peoples willingness to ignore the dollar value of things will depend on their desire to see a freer and more just world.  Peoples desire to see a freer and more just word depends on what they believe is important.  If people believe the dollar value of things is more important than the values I've just outlined, then BitCoin (as underdog_1 states) is stillborn.  If people believe freedom and a more just world is more important, the BitCoin is still viable.


At the moment this is also true.  However, there is nothing to stop you from mowing your neighbor's lawn for say .3 BTC.




False.  What matters is the value behind the tangible.  It is an exercise of resistance to the status quo.


Again, false.  If you exchange (trade for goods and service) in BitCoins right now, you will be doing so to your disadvantage, but you will be doing so because you value something different.

I love how you spin it.  It is like a neat knot that needs to be untied.  Unless you have the insight and knowledge, it seems perfectly true.  If you do have the knowledge, it takes a lot of effort and explaining to undo the knot. 
Yes, OPEC keeps oil prices high, but since it sells in USD, everyone has to have USD to buy oil.  In effect, this props up the value of the dollar, and allows the Fed to issue more currency without impacting inflation in the U.S.  In effect, the U.S. is "first in line" at the pump, regardless of the price, and other countries are forced to sell their goods to the U.S. first in order to obtain the dollars they need for oil.
Now as to working against U.S. interests.  If you are a U.S. Citizen, you will enjoy low inflation against other currencies, as the other currencies cannot do what the Fed is doing.  (Just as an example, what would happen to the value of BitCoins if a country decided to sell oil for BitCoins?) So in this respect your statement if false.
Now, on the surface, you argue that the higher price is not to U.S. interests, but as the price of oil increases, so does the demand for the dollar.  So a rise in oil prices means the Fed can issue more dollars without increasing or decreasing the value of the dollar in the U.S.  So, again, in this respect, the statement is false.
I do agree that the statement is true in the following two ways.  1. Because a trend may appear where countries begin to sell oil for say the Euro or gold, the U.S. must wage war to prevent this.  2. When the U.S. cannot stem the tide of oil sales for gold, silver, Euro's or whatever, then all those dollars in foreign bank accounts will return to the U.S. as massive inflation.
So, in what respect is OPEC working against the U.S. interests?
EDIT: I take back my comment on spin.  It is entirely possible that you did not intend to spin this topic.  It is frustrating how the arguments being given are so tied up that it is difficult to undo them.

At the current difficulty, I estimate that the electric cost for GPU mining is around $1.20 per BitCoin.  That makes a ratio of production cost vs. sell cost at around 1 to 10.
Let's consider another perspective on the costs of the U.S. dollar.  In order to defend the U.S. Dollar, the U.S. went to war with Iraq.  Estimates of this cost is around $3 Trillion that the U.S. taxpayer will have to pay.  This does not include the loss of life and the destruction of the environment in Iraq (depleted uranium shells).
If the the approximate U.S. dollar currency is around $14 trillion dollars, and the Iraq war cost $3 trillion, then the cost ratio is about 2 to 10.  With BitCoin, the cost is a one time cost.  With the U.S. currency we will need to defend the dollar over and over as oil producing nations seek to use something other than the dollar.
If you don't understand the connection between defending the dollar and the reasons for war, you need to watch ["Robert Newman's - The History of Oil"](

At the moment the moment the dollar is a superior form of currency and trade.  If you are not familiar with the problem of state run currency, then unfortunately, you have some work cut out for you.  Start with these:
* [World Suppression and the True Freedom Movement]( - the first 9 minutes.  I could debate the rest, but the first part is succinct.
* [Robert Newmans History of Oil]( - The dollar's hegemony over oil allows the U.S. Government to print money without incurring inflation.  If you understand this logic, and see those who challenge this power, you start to understand why we are at war in Libya, why the IMF head was charged with sexual assault, and why the Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez is painted as a terrorist in the U.S. media.
* [The Creature from Jekyll Island : A Second Look at the Federal Reserve]( - A long read, but well researched.  You can probably find a PDF version on the web, but I would encourage you to support the author if you have the funds.
The market for BitCoin will continue to be all over the place while people learn its value and uses.  I don't expect to see a stable value in BitCoin for a good 10 to 15 years.  Yes, there are problems with maintaining and understanding the technology, and it may turn out to be a bust.  The key is the underlying technology and what can be learned from this experiment.

[The Creature from Jekyll Island]( is the main reference.  Note that the book takes a conspiratorial view.  It does, however, explain quite well how the fractional reserve system was created and how the Federal Reserver came into being.  It looked like there may be a few PDF versions floating around the web, but please support the author if the content gives you insights.
[The History of Oil - Robert Newman]( - English comedian that gave me an important piece of the puzzle.  Basically, there is a stranglehold on oil such that in order to purchase oil, you need dollars.  This lets the Fed print money without actual inflation in the United States.  Any country that threatens to sell oil for anything other than dollars soon finds itself under attack or threat of attack by American forces.
Once you understand the "History of Oil" video, other parts of the puzzle start to fall in place.  For example, the former IMF head was proposing a different international currency other than the dollar.  And look what happened to him.  Then take a look at Libya.  Gaddafi was proposing a new currency based on gold before the protests started.  Now Nato and American forces are supposedly supporting Libyan protesters.

Why is everyone so concerned about the price?  If you are worried, then your to invested.  Everyone is so concerned with what everyone else thinks is going to happen.  What really matters is what you think and what you believe is important.  
Will you accept BitCoins for goods or services you sell?  Are you willing to deal with the volatility in price for the principle of a freer and more just world?  If so, don't worry about the price, just trade for real goods and services, and eventually it will find stability.

Like a chess problem, I cannot explain all the combinations.  Propose a solution that solves the sub chain to main chain, and I can poke holes in it.  Given the amount of value BitCoins might store (Trillions), this edge case of multiple block chains is likely to come under attack.  Again, given the potential values stored in a block chain, even a seemingly unlikely attack, becomes probable.  Even the idea of building a trust protocol for nodes has problems when we are talking about billions.
EDIT:  Perhaps there can be a voting system for block processors and BTC owners in a subchain, such that a sub chain can be turned off and merged with the main chain.  This will allow money changers to take control of a low value coin branch and merge it with the main branch to increase the coin value.  This would bypass the whole edge case problem, but would be painful for those with coins stuck in the sub branch during the transition.

To thoughts.  1. BitCoin is still not used everywhere and is sort of like silver and gold.  Their values can be easily manipulated.  2. The number of BitCoins being generated per day is still around 7200, which is about 1/4 to 1/3 of the MtGox daily volume.  If the miners are simply dumping their BTC, then it follows the price will drop.

Not everyone can specialize in computer technology.  I've seen doctors who dispise using computers.  What chance do they have of using BitCoins if they are not computer savvy?  What about your parents when they retire?  Will they be able to follow all the latest security protocols?
@_date: 2011-04-20 16:14:45
I believe he is correct for three reasons.
1. As the difficulty increases, people tend to move to pooled operations to mine BTC.  This centralizes the computation process.
2. As the number of transactions increase, not everyone will be able to afford the bandwidth and storage required.
3. Power (centralization) tends to corrupt.  If most people cannot see the block chain, and the computations happen in a centralized manner, it is only a matter of time before those who crave power or money look to take advantage of the system.
What needs to happen is that the main block chain will need to limit the number of transactions.  Then branches need to be created for "regional" trading.  This will keep the main block chain distributable and verifiable to all, while at the same time providing sub-branches that are also distributable and verifiable to those interested in trading in these "regions".  You could make regions such as "China", "U.K.", "Internet", etc.  The main block chain would keep track of the amount of BTC in each trading region branch, but those doing computations in the region would be responsible for accounting in the regional branch.

If you are desperate for a currency and BitCoins are hard to obtain, using something that is a bit more expandable may be a happy medium.  For example, making the number of units produced proportional to the computational power on the block chain would get the currency into more peoples hands.  The drawback is that over time the value of that currency depreciates.

(4.) There are edge case attacks that I did not go into detail about.  Think about how you can cause problems by moving from a sub-block to the main block.  For example, you win a block computation to the main chain, but in your block computation you include a movement from a sub-chain to the main chain.  Now lets say someone has 20 nodes that say this block is invalid (they have been hacked).  This means the rest of the network that does not have a copy of the branch and cannot verify the validity of the block you just solved.  How will the network react?  Also, what happens when one branch gets attacked by the 51% problem, where the computations get 10 or more blocks ahead.  In this case someone may try to fake moving blocks from the sub-block to the main chain.  How is this defended against?
(5.) The hooks idea was not fully formed.  It was just vague idea to look at ideas to allow third parties to allow a customer to pay a merchant that is on a different sub-chain.  The Problem: Transaction fees have risen on the main block chain A to .1 BTC.  Merchant X only accepts payments on sub block chain B.  Customer Y wants to purchase an item from X for 1 BTC, but has his BitCoins stored on chain C.  Money changer Z has coins stored on all sub-chains, and maintains copies of all block chains. (Z has lots of storage and bandwidth.)  Transaction costs on chains B and C are .001.  Without Z, Y would have to download B, move his funds from C to A, and then to B, incurring .102 in transaction fees and waiting perhaps upward of an hour or more.  (See my comments for 4.  To ensure block validity before moving into the main chain, a block would have to sit around for some time.)  In order to streamline this process, there needs to be some mechanism to allow Z to place open bids for transaction clearing between sub-branches.  Perhaps he bids .005 BTC to clear such transactions, and when he has too many BTC in one branch, he groups all his funds together to make one large BTC move for .102 to re-balance his funds.
Other ideas to consider.
1. Block clean up.  Perhaps some sort of rule that says a particular portion of each new block is dedicated to consolidating old blocks.  This shortens the block chain and conserves bandwidth for nodes just joining.
2. Node validity check.  In the case where someone suspects that a node is not keeping all the branches he says he is, another node can issue a challenge.  "What is the hash of all the blocks from 18592 to 18599 on branch C?" or "What is the hash of blocks, 18444, 18492, and 18501 of branch D?"  It is cheaper to send one hash vs. a whole block, and thus identifying a problem node becomes quicker.

I agree.  Not much here worth commenting on.  It is a poorly constructed hit piece.  He fails to rebut things like:
1. Bitcoins cannot be stolen or seized, short of someone putting a gun to your head for your file's password.  Even then, it would be difficult to determine how many BTC someone owns if the files are hidden.
2. The U.S. government used the great depression as a reason to seized private gold.
3. The depression of 1920 was just as deep as the great depression, but because there was little government intervention, the depression only lasted about a year or so.
4. Without the ability to inflate currency, governments have limited ability to grow or wage major offensive war.
There are really to many holes in this piece to comment further.

I agree with these characteristics:

You may want to consider:
* How would a user backed promise to pay be divisible?
* How about a block chain incorporating what you are talking about, but also issues a new "coin" system based on computational power.  E.G. The larger the computational power, the more coins issued.  This would solve the problem of an upward push in value by causing more people to mine more coins and thus keep a bubble from happening.

It is all about legitimacy.  If governments are to stop BitCoin, they have to find a ways of demonizing it in the minds if citizens.  If democratic governments simply decide to outlaw such alternative monies, government legitimacy would decrease.  So such a move at this time would not be wise.  Events such as the liberty dollar event, and poker site shutdowns are probably tests to see how people will react.  These events also serve as ways to get people used to the idea that alternative currencies are bad.
The BitCoin site does not help matters by showing [gambling]( [adult]( and [file sharing sites]( that take BTC.  This only gives leverage to any agency to argue that BTC is being used for money laundering, piracy, or corruption of minors.  This could mean that anyone running a BTC mining operation may be charged for these crimes, even though the case against them would be flimsy.  Such charges would have a devastating effect on the legitimacy of this new "currency".

Only about 6 million of the total 21 million have been generated.
Given the current BTC to $, I would not recommend buying a full computer system for BTC mining, as it would take 6 months to a year to pay for the investment.  However, I would recommend upgrading your video card, as that would only take a month or two of mining to pay for a $250 investment.  Plus, you get cool graphics for your gaming.
The full potential of BTC has not yet been reached.  Depending on the acceptance, the final value of a BTC could be anywhere from $100 to $2.1 million.  If 21 million BTC were to replace 14 Trillion (the current U.S. money supply), each BTC would be worth $650K each.  So I believe the current exchange rate is still super low.

BitCoin is still not mature enough to support a business that is based on goods only.  Price fluctuations will be a problem for years to come until people get a feel for what a BTC is worth.  However, business that are service based that are not running at full capacity would benefit from the use of BTC, by offering their services below the going rate for BTC.  For those businesses, some revenue is better than no revenue. (In fact with the current rate of deflation, they may actually find their profits grow by simply holding the BTC for a while.)
Deflation is not a problem, so long as the deflation is predictable.  In fact deflation encourages people to hold BitCoins instead of investing.  This is a cool way to slow down the consumerist and wasteful society that has been created.  While the current deflation is not predictable eventually it will be.

It is a question of scale.  Each transaction takes at least 60 bytes.  It has been quoted that Visa and MasterCard process on the order of 2000 transactions per second.  If everyone has a copy of the transactions for verification, the numbers start getting to big for the average BitCoin user's internet.  Crunch the numbers yourself to see how large they get.
I've hinted at solutions (on the sub-reddit) whereby the block chain is split into metaphorical zones, where everyone has the main block chain, but then have only selected chains based on the zone they trade in.  BitCoins could move from the main chain to the branch chains as needed, and then back again.  This could solve the scalability problems, but I'm not yet a full expert on the underlying code.
In any case, the solution will have to be hashed out in the next few years before the scale becomes to much for the BitCoin architecture.  Short term, BitCoin exchange can probably handle 100 times the current number of transactions.  I suspect after that, changes or centralization will be needed.

Somehow, I suspect you are right.  I wonder what federal law says regarding FRN's.  A dollar reads "THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE".  I also know that there is some law about refusing the payment of a debt.  (If you offer to pay a debt, and the offer is refused, then the debt is nullified.)  So, if you buy something on debt and then offer to pay cash and it is refused, then the debt is null.

&lt;shrug&gt; Even if they drop back to around $1 to $2 dollars each, it is not a big deal to me.  BitCoin will not die.  Evolve, perhaps, but not die. Eventually there will be a currency crisis someplace and people will look for an alternative.  BitCoin will be around (or perhaps its successor) and real value will be built beyond the control of government intervention.
For an example, do a search for "argentina alternative currency".  It is just a matter of time.

If there is no need for expansion to ever occur, then perhaps the current block chain should stop producing BitCoins and just leave the number of coins at about 8 million coins.
As I stated above, eventually miners would find it unprofitable to "mine" new BitCoins and would only do so to obtain the transaction fees.  So unless transaction fees make up a large percentage of the total number of coins, the new coins generated from transaction fees would be something less than say  .1% per year.  At that rate of expansion, it would take 700 years to double the number of coins.  In comparison, the inflation rate of the dollar is something like 5%... which would only take 13 to 14 years to have a 50% decrease in value.
In essence, such a system would have the same locked number of coins, the difference would be that the BitCoin method wold be locked via a 20 year system, and the method I'm proposing would be limited by the coin demand.  Also, there would be no "early adopter" benefit, and those trying to hoard coins and manipulate value would find they could not do so without loss of value.

It all depends on how popular you think BitCoins will be in a years time.  The current number of BitCoins is around 6 million, and at $3.80 per BTC, that makes the current market capitalization of about 23 Million.  Keep in mind that the number of BitCoins being introduced to the system is around 50% for 2011 and around 33% for 2012, and then around 10% or less for the years thereafter. 
23 million is an incredibly small amount when taking into account the number of U.S. dollars (around 14 trillion).  So, how do you think BTC will be used?  Will BTC be used for a good portion of online transactions?  How about in person sales?
Here is an example of how I look at it.  I figure BTC will account for at least 1/10th of a percent (.1%) of the transactions in the U.S. in 3 to 4 years time.  So, figuring .1% of 14 trillion gives 14 billion.  Since there will be only 21 million BTC, I divide 14 billion by 21 million to give me a ball park idea of what bitcoins will be worth in the future.  14 billion divided by 21 million gives me about $670 per bitcoin.
However, that figure is not without risk, as BitCoins are still experimental, and may hit technical, social or political problems that may limit its use.  In these cases BitCoin's value could stay low or fall to near nothing.  Only time will tell.

A fairly stable value IS important, be it slowly increasing or slowly decreasing.  A highly fluctuating value makes it meaningless as a means of exchange.
Any new currency created that is a threat will have a highly fluctuating value unless it is directly tied to something of known value.  In the case of BitCoin, it's value is only based on faith, as is most other state run currencies.  BitCoin is at a disadvantage because it is a **voluntary** system, and since it is so new and small, it can be targeted by the state systems to shake people's faith in the new system.
What is needed is people that will offer goods or services at a discount to BitCoin's dollar exchange value and a willingness to hold their BTC price regardless of the dollar exchange value.  This is what happened with the Euro when Saddam Hussein started selling oil for Euro's instead of dollars.  Iraq took an initial percentage loss on the value they could obtain, and the Euro strengthened in value while the dollar lost strength.  Eventually, Iraq actually made an increase in net worth because the rate at which Euro's were being printed was far less than the dollars being printed.

It is a convoluted explanation.
Basically, all the money the Fed has issued has interest tied to it.  Meaning that if the Fed issued $100 at an interest rate of 5%, then $105 is owed to the Fed in the first year, even though the total amount of currency is only $100.  This means the money owed can never be repaid.
The money is usually lent into circulation via the government or to the banks.  Hence the Fed is called the "lender of last resort".  In order for the money to be issued, someone has to hold the loan.  As long as you are 5% more efficient than the next guy (who also borrows to get FDR's), you can pay off the "loan" and make a profit.  However, eventually, people at the bottom rungs of society or the government ends up with all the debt and have to default.

The resale value is a good point.  But when I think of ROI (return on investment), I think of the day when I get my original investment back in revenue, not the resell value of the investment.
I finished mining some time in June when temperatures started to make it indefeasible to stay cool and mine at the same time.  I'm keeping my equipment for mining in winter months. However, others who are serious miners will want to take the resell value into account.  If you buy a bunch of FPGA boards, their resell value may change drastically as the FPGA market shapes up.  GPU's have the advantage of alternative uses and can be sold to gamers.

The biggest obstacle is getting a few BitCoins into the hands of everyone.  It needs to be everywhere.
It can be promoted with the idea of moderate investment (say $50) and explaining the upside (&gt;$2k per BitCoin) and the downside (full loss because of government meddling).  Further, we need to discourage people from investing past their comfort level.  Having people in the market who have invested say $10k and are scared shitless about a $2k loss in value only cause harm to themselves (they will buy and sell at the wrong times) and to the value of BitCoin in the long run.
Promoting by encouraging people to invest all their funds and go into debt will only destabilize things and produce major swings in BTC value.

BitCoin was getting some bad reputation in so I posted a challenge.
[If BitCoin is a scam, how about using the source code to create something better?](
If you want to follow up with the inflationary idea check out [The current Bitcoin economic model doesn't work](  The idea is that the number of coins generated is proportional to the block chain problem difficulty.  Eventually, the electric cost would be greater than the coin value and people would stop the calculation work and only work for the transaction fees.  This would cause a lot more energy usage than the conventional BTC though.

Yep.  Some application of physical BitCoins would leave the coins in place with no need to exchange them.  Others such as mtgox.com would handle the transactions with no need to move coins into the block chain.  Hopefully this is how it will be handled.


Actually, how the banking system is configured, most of the money is created by the banks through fractional reserve banking.  This money is lent to the public at interest.  For instance, if 90% of the money is created by the banks at say 4% interest, that would be $500B per year based on a money supply of $14T.  **So, those that own the banking system are not interested in maintaining wealth, they are interested in extracting wealth.**  With a currency that cannot be expanded based on fractional reserve banking, they cannot expand the currency and charge interested on that expansion.  At best they can garner a good chunk of it and charge interest, but not nearly the 90% they can now charge interest on.
EDIT: Note that $14T is based on U.S. money supply.  Make it $50T or so for the world currency valuation.

There is plenty of BTC (it is divisible enough).  The same with gold and silver.  So how does one turn a "commodity" into an actual circulated currency?  With the Fed, it is a matter making it a law and manipulating the supply to keep it fairly stable. (At the expense of wars and long term drain of wealth.)
Right now gold and silver are commodities (and their prices are manipulated to keep them from becoming readily circulated as currency.)

We appreciate any payments in BitCoin that can help improve stability.  At the moment, BitCoin is not yet a stable currency, but there are options.
Your best bet if you need stability is to make sure you use some sort of MtGox calculation in the value (BTC to Dollar), and also send the funds to MtGox every few hours and sell the amounts.  The maximum value that would be lost is the revenue for those few hours.  Warn users that your BTC prices change every 10 or so minutes.

Because there are so many ways the value of BTC could fail and because the price flies all over the place, I would classify BitCoins at the derivatives level.  I'm not saying that it IS a derivative, but rather it's risk characteristics make it like a derivative.  Further, I'm not saying that BitCoins are a bad bet or investment.  On the contrary, because there is such a phenomenal upward potential, I would call BitCoins a good investment... but only in small amounts.

Ok.  Here is the problem.  If moving from a sub chain to the main chain, and the sub chain has initiated the move (for 10 or how many blocks are needed), and the next generated block contains the transaction, then the nodes that have access to the main chain, but not the sub-chain could not directly verify the main chain block.  Only those having access to both the sub-chain and main chain could verify the block.
Now, because the chain has been divided into main chain and sub-chains, an attack can be launched to cause disruption by saying this main chain block is invalid (even though it is valid).  This would cause disruption as the nodes that don't have access would have to start pulling up the sub chain to see who is causing the attack and disallow those nodes.
Another attack can happen if the sub chain become the attack of a 51% computing attack.  In this case, because the computing power is distributed, the sub-chains are weaker.  If left on their own, the chain would eventually correct.  However, this 51% attack along with moving coins from the sub-chain to the main could mean the attacker places a bad block in the sub-chain to move to the main, but since the attacker is far enough ahead of the other's in the sub-chain, he can make up stuff to place in the main chain before the others in the sub-chain can dispute his sub-chain blocks.

BitCoin on cell phones is what everyone is hoping for.  The problem is that the block chain is so long that bandwidth would be a problem.
I wonder if the BitCoin protocol can be changed so that cell phones can query for blocks of certain addresses so that the full block chain need not be loaded onto the phones.  That way a smart phone client see the full balance of a wallet.  An extra check could be set up so that a client could check do a checksum of the blocks and then query several different nodes to verify that the correct blocks have been obtained without sending the full blocks again.

Don't get to excited about price fluctuation.  BTC will not function as real money/currency until the inflation rate drops a bit and everyone knows what BTC are.  Inflation is currently at 50% per year.  Also, since BTC is not known by everyone, it will suffer from people becoming aware in "waves".

I agree somewhat. What's happened is everyone over extended and put ALL their money in BitCoins.  No balance.  So all that was needed was someone with a lot of funds to push the price up another 20%, watch the last remnant of people with a little spare cash clamor to buy at even higher prices, and then start a panic by selling sharply.  No-one has spare dollars to stabilize at the high price and so people sell, causing a snowball effect.
What needs to happen is there has to be other things that people can buy with BitCoins that will give it an intrinsic value beside just a money exchange.

If prices are rising 20% per year, it is difficult to know if the money supply is increasing or if someone is simply selling their Belarus currency.  To be fair, the BitCoin supply is increasing at an annualized rate of 39%.  (6 * 50 * 356 / 6719000)  Also, keep in mind that the daily fluctuation in BTC value is still massive.  In order to be a more attractive currency, the Belarus currency has to be worse than the current BitCoin problems.
The only reason BTC is increasing in value is because its acceptance is outpacing its issuance.  Give it time.  Next year's BTC issuance rate will be around 33%, and then it tapers off to around 12% in the year after that.
@_date: 2011-07-25 05:52:19
I've been considering a solution to this problem and I believe I have a solution that helps the problem.  It would require a modification to the protocol to include the following logic.
1. A user proposes a BitCoin swap for X BTC each for Y participants.  The proposer pays a transaction fee to initiate the swap, and the initiation is recorded in the block chain.
2. Users who wish to participate send their destination addresses within the next 10 to 20 blocks, but do not send any BTC yet.  Each participant records his acceptance in the block chain, and pays the transaction fees to record the transactions.
3. Once enough users agree to the swap via recording their destination addresses in the 10 to 20 blocks of the block chain, they have another 10 to 20 blocks to send funds to complete the swap.
4. If not enough users agree to swap, the swap is ignored in the block chain.
5. If not enough users send in funds, the swap is ignored in the block chain.
6. If enough users send destination addresses, and enough funds are sent to the "swap", then the destination addresses are counted to have added X BTC each, while the source addresses are reduced by X BTC each.
1. Users could agree to exchange but then fail to do so, wasting block space and the other users' transaction fees.
2. There is still a 1/Y th connection between the swap and your funds.
3. Multiple swaps would have to happen over a random time interval to make it difficult to determine the source.
4. If swapping is not a normal occurring activity, then the activity becomes suspicious.
5. Swapping would make it more difficult to clean up the block chain as blocks become old.
EDIT: Started to think about it, and the transaction fees may taint the destination addresses, so step 2. would have to be free and paid for by the initiator in step one.

Very cool idea.  From my understanding, yes, you can get the balances and such from the public portion of the key pair.

In theory you could keep your computer disconnected from the internet, copy the "send to" address and give it to someone.  When they send you coins, they are still yours, even though your computer is off the net.  All you need to do is copy your wallet to a computer connected to the net and wait for the block chain to download.

Network bandwidth only impacts you when you are downloading/uploading the blocks for a client.
Bandwidth is not as much of a problem if you are pool mining.  If you are on a slow network and doing pooled mining, then what will impact you the most is latency, the time it takes for the first byte to reach it's destination once it is sent.  There is no telling how much this will impact your FPGA.  The only way to tell is to take a normal card and run it against a pool for 30 minutes or so, then check the [mining comparison chart]( to see what percentage of loss you would incur because of latency.  Then apply this percentage to the theoretical numbers.
Personally, I would not do this on a solar setup unless I had extra electricity to spare.  Otherwise you would have to expand your grid to compensate for the 700 watt power supply and extra computer.  This pushes out your ROI because of the grid expantion.

Equipment overhead is much lower than standard graphic cards.  If you are using say 3 6990's ($2310) then you need hardware to run those GPU's... say another $500.  However, if what the article is saying is true (USB connection and 7 watt connection) then your overhead becomes the bandwidth to your computer and the space to lay these things out.  So the overhead is fixed at around $700, and as long as there is enough USB bandwidth you could run say 50 off of an external 700 watt power supply and daisy chain the USB to a computer controlling them all.
My rough estimation of GPU electric costs per BitCoin is around $5.  These guys cut it to under 50 cents each.
So, here are my rough calculations...
6990*3 + computer ( $2,310 + $500 )= $2,810 = 2100 Mhash/s.  I get:
* $6.51 per day = 431 days ROI
1 computer + 50 FGPU = $22,700.  I get:
* @ 5,000 MHash/sec  (100 * 50) = 2.51 BTC/day = $26.857 per day = 845.21 days to ROI
* @ 7,500 MHash/sec  (150 * 50) = 3.76 BTC/day = $40.232 per day = 564.22 days to ROI
* @ 10,000 MHash/sec (200 * 50) = 5.01 BTC/day = $53.607 per day = 423.45 days to ROI
They are in the ballpark.  But since the technology is new, and mining sucks at the moment, I would not invest yet.
P.S. Other things to consider.  If you live in a cold climate and use electricity to heat your house, then the electric cost of mining is $0, because you would heat your house with electricity anyhow.  If you live in a warm climate, then it sucks to be you.
EDIT: snowball666 pointed out that the cost to run 3 6990's should not be $1k.  Corrected to $500.

There is no direct link between the value of BitCoins and the Dollar.  However, there are a few things you need to know about BitCoins to properly determine their value.
1. BTC inflation rate is currently at 50% per year.  This will decrease to 33% next year, and will eventually start to become reasonable in 2017 when BTC inflation will be around 4% per year.
2. Acceptance of BTC may outpace it's inflation rate, so BTC values may shoot up on speculation.  It could also fall rapidly on bad news.
3. Although not illegal nor immoral to own or use BTC, the powers that be may decide to take actions (regardless of what the law says or allows) to destroy BitCoin.
4. Laws may be passed to force users of cryptology to entrust keys with government agencies.  In the states, this is a clear violation of constitutional rights, but lately, the constitution does not seem to matter.  I've read about the requirement in either the U.K. or E.U. to provide upon request keys to encrypted data on your hard drive if the government requests it.  If you don't provide the keys, you could face jail time.
5. On the up side, if BTC were to replace the current U.S. money supply, each BTC would be worth around $650,000 each.  If BTC were to replace global currency, each BTC would be worth around $2.1 Million each.
My personal take on BTC is to use it like novelty money or an instrument of speculation/investment.  Eventually, the centers of power will find ways to sideline BitCoin, as they need ways to inflate money for purposes of war.

The way I picture it is that the transaction fee varies based on the average block size.  So, one can always calculate how much transaction fees are based on the chain they are on.  Also, there will be a hard limit of some sort... say 10k.

Not really.  The idea is to divide the transactions so that you are only dealing with a portion of the total transactions.  It has been stated that Visa and MasterCard process something like 2000 transactions per second.  That is just to large for the current block chain to master.  However, if you divide them up into "regions" or separate branches, then everyone can continue to manage the transactions in a distributed fashion.  The idea of a "region" is not centralization, but rather just a way to better keep things distributed.  There is nothing to stop you from working on the "China" regional branch if you reside in India or the United States.  Also, you could load multiple regions, so long as you have the bandwidth and storage to do so.  The regions are simply ways of grouping areas where trade is likely to occur.  
There will still need to be mechanisms to move BTC from one branch to the next through the main block branch.  For instance, moving funds from India to the U.K. "branch", would require someone with enough bandwidth to handle the India, U.K. and main branches all at once. 
Also, keep in mind that "regional" is just a concept to refer to the branching.  A branch could represent something like "internet trades", "gambling trades", "Smart Phone POS", etc.  If you plan to spend BTC in a particular way, you could move your funds to that branch ahead of time to make for quicker processing.  Also, some branches could be configured so that blocks are built every minute, instead of every 10 minutes.
Think of branching as a "divide and conquer" approach.  By dividing the work with branches, you can keep things distributed and accountable at the same time.
Yes, the idea of ignoring old transactions is a good way to save on storage (and bandwidth for new users).  However, 2000 transactions per second is just an insane amount of bandwidth and storage.  Assuming 60 bytes per transaction, you are looking at around .4 Gig per hour, 10 Gig per day, and 311 per month... and that is download only.

There was once a security hole in the Debian Linux distribution that allowed ssh access to boxes.  While this is an example of an open source security problem, it is important to understand that the code base for Linux is much larger than the code base for BitCoin.  Also, because quite a few people are vested in the success of BitCoin, they are very keen on ensuring there are no errors.
Also, if there were counterfeiters, eventually the error would be caught, as the block chain is open to anyone with the programming skills to identify the counterfeit coins.  This has already happened with BitCoin, although the counterfeiter did not spend his coin, he simply left it in place to demonstrate the error.
I would not yet suggest BitCoin as a total replacement for a state backed currency at this stage in the game.  (The exception being hyper inflation beyond 50% per year...  in which case, almost any alternative currency would be superior.)  Give BitCoin time to prove itself.  In the mean time, put a few BitCoins aside for yourself just in case BitCoin takes off.  Perhaps you could sell a few items on BitCoin forums.

If it were the same account, it would be limited to $1k for the day.  If it were on multiple accounts, it would be limited to $1k per day per account.  If you are sending funds to the same BitCoin address across multiple accounts, you should see multiple transactions in the block for much less than 423K.  The only way I can see 423K BTC transaction from multiple accounts would be if the BitCoin protocol somehow decided to combine the transactions into a single transaction.
EDIT: $1k per day per account.

Historically, yes.  The U.S. basically broke the back of Russian power when we tricked them into Afghanistan.  However, I don't see their country as a serious military power.  Perhaps enough to defend themselves through conventional warfare, and a suicide attack if they get desperate enough with nukes.








The economics of civilian nuclear power simply aren't their in Iran either, considering they live in a nation that has copious fossil fuels.
They've also got quite the rocket program, despite not sharing a border with any nation that might conceivably represent a military threat.
Sure they may be developing for peaceful purposes, but I wouldn't bet a dime on it given ten million to one odds. I think most of the world agrees with me.
From what I've gathered, they may have have developed one nuke.  Enough to make a foreign invader pause.  The only real reason to have nukes is to earn the respect of the international community.  Even though the Iranian leader may be painted as crazy, I cannot see this leader just shooting is one nuke for nothing.  I suspect that if he proves to have a few nukes, he will pony up to the negotiation table and demand to be recognized.
Anyhow, we've traveled quite a ways from our original discussion.  I'll sumerize:
I argue:
1. The near monopoly of dollars for oil provides the U.S. with its military strength via near unrestrained printing of money to fund the U.S. budget.
2. The inflation of printing dollars is shouldered by other countries that need the oil, and must sell their goods to the U.S. for dollars.  They hold these dollars to buy oil.
3. The value of goods in the U.S. stays stable (or has stayed stable) for the most part because of this mechanism.
4. If oil producing nations begin to sell their oil for other currencies, then countries that need oil will soon relinquish their dollars and the U.S. will experience massive inflation.
5. Also, if oil producing nations stop taking dollars, the U.S. government will not be able to "borrow" dollars from the Fed to feed the military.  Thus, the government will have to either cut the military or drastically increase taxes.  Note that the government could "borrow" from the Fed, but it will just be a tax through real inflation.
You argue: (Correct what you need so we can wind down the conversation.)
1. OPEC keeps oil prices artificially high.
2. These artificially high oil prices are to the detriment of the U.S.
3. The CIA was not instrumental in starting the revolution in Libya.

Ok.  I've given it some thought, and there are only two solutions I can formulate.
1. Make the move to the main chain super slow (over say 2 or 3 days).  Add extra protocols to identify the trust level of those nodes who say the transaction is valid.  A transaction should be held for a few days to give supporters and dissenters a chance to indicate validity or invalidity.  If there is a disagreement about a transaction, all nodes should query into the sub-chain from the block where the transaction is to happen and then down the chain (to earlier blocks) until the discrepancy is found and the lying/attacking nodes are identified.
2. (This may not be popular.) Don't allow transactions back into the main chain.  This may result in coins in some chains to be worth less than coins in another chain.  Also, if activity in a sub chain goes to low, a protocol could be used to stop all transactions in the sub-chain, and move existing blocks into the main chain over a period of days or weeks.
Oh well.  That's the best I can think of.

I've been thinking about this for months.  The best solution I have is to allow the main block chain to delegate coins to branch block chains.  The branch block chain would work the same was as the main block chain, except that it would not generate new coins, those working on the branch block chain would only get coins by transaction fees.  The number of transactions in the main block chain will be limited to keep the size manageable.
The interface would have to change so that bitcoin only downloads the branch or branches you specify.  Further, branches would be broken down into "trading regions", where trades are more likely to happen within those regions.
By doing this, everyone will have the main block chain and one or two branches where their coins would be stored and where their transactions would likely happen, and the number of transactions per branch and trunk could be manageable.
The only drawback I see to this method is when coins traverse back to the main block chain.  Since not everyone has all the branches, a block on the main block chain showing coins coming from a branch could be attacked in such a way as to confuse those not having the appropriate branches, and the ones working on the main block chains would have to load up the branch chains to see which IP's were attempting to fake a transaction.  (Basically, the main chain block miners would hate this solution.)
It is difficult to describe what I'm thinking about.  Please ask questions, and I'll fill in what I've considered.

I would want $20 in BTC to start with, as it has a few advantages.
1. Assuming I was simply given a memory stick with a wallet.dat file, it is a bit less traceable.  If you won the lottery, nasty people start bugging you, so it is better that people don't know you have $20 in value.
2. $20 Million in gold would weigh 1250 bls, so BTC would be easier to store.
3. $20 million in gold would constitute about 1 cubic feet of space.
4. Security for $20 million in gold would be more expensive.
Now, if I had that much BTC and it constituted 95% of my savings, I would slowly diversify my investment into gold, silver, and land, and possibly a few corrupt lawmakers to change the currency laws.

There are two major features it lacks:
1. The block chain is not scale-able.  While I have some good ideas about how to split the block chain up without compromising security, I'm sure it would scare most of the developers, as million's of dollars are at stake.
2. It is not expandable.  E.G. More coins cannot be added when demand increases to keep a steady value.  This makes BitCoin susceptible to currency manipulation similar to how the value of gold is manipulated.  It also means that persons of power can gather up a large portion of BitCoins.
If you are worried about a competing alternative crypto currency stepping in, you may want to consider the road blocks BitCoin has created for future competition in the crypto currency arena:
1. It is the current default virtual currency.
2. It has a very good base of exchanges to move money between BTC and existing currencies.

I think they are interested because wide spread use of BitCoins would hamper governments ability to wage war.  This would drastically change the world power structure and shift warfare as we know it into an electronic domain.
If the objective is globalization, BitCoin does fit well as a global currency.  It has some interesting properties that help globalization.
1. You cannot physically steel BitCoins.  In fact, attempting to do so could result in destruction of BitCoins and deflation.  You may be able to hack someone's computer and take the BitCoin wallet, but that is a lot less destructive than threatening or killing them.
2. Deflation will encourage slower growth.  This happens because people can sit on their appreciating BitCoins instead of working to avoid inflation.  Slower growth fits better with the environmental problems we are having with massive industrialization.
3. BitCoins have the potential to be ubiquitous.  As long as there is an internet connection, BitCoins can exist.  One could send money to anyone around the globe in a matter of minutes.  People in emerging nations would have a way to exchange value unencumbered banking structures and corruption. (Assuming infrastructure for internet or data cell phone service.)  Again, theft becomes difficult and the poor have a better chance of accumulating wealth.
4. People would have more faith in a decentralized uncontrolled money system.  This would spur smart growth instead of the steroid induced growth the world has seen thus far.  (Freedom is a great way to encourage innovation.)
5. Going to physical war would only destroy BitCoins and slow down economic production in both the attacking and defending countries.
6. Encouraging or allowing BitCoins to become a real currency would be seen as an indication to "Gold Bugs" and others in the Libertarian movement that the world powers are not interested in power for powers sake, but are rather interested in the advancement of world civilization.
If the objective is world hegemony, BitCoins would obviously be a threat.

This is exactly how I would go about taking a large pot and putting it into lots of small pots.  I bet you he/she is taking their wallet.dat file and making lots of offline wallet.dat files and then sending funds to these files.  That way, the risk is reduced.  For example, when you go to spend with a wallet.dat file, you are only exposing 20 to 50 BTC per file instead of a full 34k of BTC.  You simply copy one of your offline BTC files to an online computer and start spending what you need.

Ok.  I had another idea about how to divide the block chain, but avoids the sub chain to main chain problem.
1. Coins can freely move from main chain to sub-chain.
2. The main chain functions as a command and control center as well as a place for coins.
3. Coins cannot move from sub chain to main chain.  (With one exception mentioned later.)
4. The sub chains report their difficulty and the average number of transactions into the main block chain and the average number of active chain copies.
5. On occasion, the main chain will direct a sub-chain to go "offline" and merge with another block chain.  The chain getting the merge will stay online and integrate the merging chain's transactions over a period of a day or so.  The rules for this merge process will be based on statistics posted to the main chain.  Those working either chain will have to have both chains to process the merge.  Occasionally, the main chain will have to few transactions and request a merge of a sub-chain into the main chain.
6. On occasion, the main chain will direct a sub-chain to split to balance transactions.  Also, occasionally, the main block chain will split transactions to keep things balanced.
7. When a sub chain goes offline, funds in that node are not accessible.  A warning system could be used to notify holders of coins in these chains based on the main chain directives.  Perhaps the main chain could notify the network two days in advance to help both customers and the network to prep for the merge (nodes containing just one of the chains will need to get copies of the other chain).
Rewards for simply operating a node.
Mining is one thing, but operating a node on the network helps improve accountability.  A mechanism is needed to reward those storing, transmitting, and verifying block chains.  The ideas I have are sketchy, but if done properly, a smart phone could bypass downloading all the transactions, but rather depend on those supporting the chains.
1. Every node that keeps track of the main branch and one or more sub-branches can respond to requests for blocks containing particular keys.  This allows 'thin'er clients like smart phones to avoid downloading all the blocks.  For example, say my wallet has the 3 key pairs, and would like to know where the funds for these keys are stored.  It can find out what servers will take the request and process to get only the blocks containing these keys.
2. The number and type of requests made by each "node" is recorded by the nodes involved.  Every so often, these records are broadcast within the sub-chains to keep track of who is helping maintain the chain via network and transmission operations.
3. When blocks are built, a portion of the transaction fees are payed out to nodes maintaining the network.  Block builders cannot cheat the network operators, as they will probably be outnumbered by the network operators.  (Pools are more centralized that the network operators.)
4. Rules would need to be set up to determine fair usage.  For example, key queries are worth more than block transmissions, those with open IP's get a larger share than those behind firewalls, those with longer up-times get bigger rewards.
EDIT: Again, these are sketchy details, but in my mind, it solves the edge cases.

If you are a coder, you would create one transaction for each withdraw and not combine the transactions across accounts.  Combining transactions across accounts is not a case a programmer would consider.  1. It would have to be coded as a special case, 2. anyone doing a code review would question the security aspect of such a special case and would quickly fire the programmer and possibly call the authorities for suspicious coding.
EDIT: "call the authorities"... I'm not sure if an employer would do this, but the programmers credibility (as character trust is concerned) would be jeopardized.

I figured in the $5 per electricity for the GPU and the 50 cents for the FPGU.
If the electric cost (cooling and running) is $5 for the GPU and the going rate for BTC is 11.2, then it is $6.2 per BTC produced on a GPU.  Also, 2100 MHash/sec for 24 hours is about 1.08 BTC.  So you get $6.2 * 1.08 BTC = $6.51 per day.

Any new crypto currency needs to address the latecomer aspect, or it simply takes on BitCoin's bad "ponzi" label.  Calculations that are CPU based are better than GPU because it is a more equitable method.  However, it still does not solve the latecomer problem. 
I would suggest CPU based AND coin release based on difficulty.  This would make the coin base more stable with respect to demand.  It would also solve the latecomer problem.
@_date: 2011-10-24 23:34:58
I still think there should be a variant of BitCoin that distributes coins according to the difficulty.  Perhaps decreasing the coins per difficulty over a 10 to 30 year period until coins cannot be created by computation.  This would cap the upper value of each coin, as a higher price would make more miners come on line to make a small profit.

Not saying if they did or did not have knowledge.  I'm just thinking about the tactful way to fix a security problem without admitting there is a problem.
1. Pull site down.  Call the downtime "necessary security maintenance".
2. Add code to force password change and verify through email.
3. Treat any accusations of account compromise prior to the change in step 2 as a customer service issue.  Explain that he/she is a valued customer and MtGox will compensate the user just this once.  Encourage the user to install virus protection and to change their passwords on a regular basis, but don't admit guilt.
4. Long term, implement RSA security dongles.  Offer it to customers as a feature and sell the option for a 1 BTC fee.
5. Quietly limit your liability for hacking by changing the "terms of service".

Unfortunately, a lot of the value is about perception.  If Google weighs in, it will have quite a bit more credibility than BitCoin right off the bat.  Since Google has some ties to the intelligence community, I would bet that Gavin's visit to the CIA IT company was the start of all this.
Further, if this rumor is true, the implications are staggering.  The potential for a legitimate replacement of the dollar backed by a $200 Billion company with web search, advertisement, mobile phone systems, and merchant payment systems could set the stage for the end of debt based money.  As it is, state sponsored currencies are tanking various economies around the world and governments that depend on these currencies to fund their activities will fall as well.  
It all depends on if it is an expandable currency and if Google is willing to let go and make it open source so everyone will accept it.  If not, then people will claim it as a Ponzi scheme or reject it as a gimmick to promote the Google brand.

A few ideas to run with:
1. Make the fake address something everyone can agree is a fake address... or else people will think there is a way to use the coins sent to the "fake" address.  For example, the rule for the "fake" address is that it be a hash of the message "this is a hash of a block" + the hash of a block within the last 24 hours.
2. Make the transaction fees variable from day to day based on a block size of say 10k (or some reasonable size).  If the daily transaction size goes over 10k, increase the transaction fees for that chain by say 10%, then 20% if it stays above the 10k on the next day, etc.  Do the opposite if the transaction size is below say 9k.
3. Keep a main chain that everyone downloads to demonstrate the number of coins put into the HubCoin system.  The main chain can be used to move blocks to the other chains and also keeps track of the number of coins in each of the 'sub' chains.
4. In order to move from a 'sub' chain to another 'sub' chain, coins must be moved through the main chain.  (The process would be slow, but it improves accountability.)
5. Create hooks for "money changers" that would allow quick exchange of coins in one chain for those in another.  the "money changers" could charge a fee for this service.  In this case, coins would not move through the main block chain, but rather coins would be 'exchanged'.  The "money changers" would work to balance their funds through the main block chain to keep a quick handful of coins in the various chains.

2. Password cracking for a fee greater than the per hour BTC rate. All that computational power can be put to other uses.  If I lost my password to a OneNote file, it would be cool if I could crack it in say 5 minutes for say $200... or something like that.
3. Optional NameCoin mining.  
4. Create an optional rendering engine service.  It would be cool if Pixar could use all these graphic cards to make a video.  I'm sure they would be happy to pay for the quick rendering.
Charge 3% or less for all of these options.

Decentralized ripple exchange with a block chain to register transactions, register relations, deal with accounting.
Actually, **a global block chain service could be used for a whole slew of useful ideas**.  Block chains are super useful and can be used for a lot of things besides BitCoin and ripple.  They can be used to time stamp things, store data distributively, are resistant against censorship, could be used as an alternative to the web, etc.  Imagine using [I2P]( to make a distributed site with a block chain service!  How about using the global block chain service to make a distributed Reddit service.  Also, make the service payable via BitCoins. **The whole web could go underground.**
EDIT: Another idea... Use a global block chain service with [Open Transaction](  This would eliminate the need for a server to clear transactions.  It would be part of the global chain.

I've been thinking along the same lines.  Centralization of pools means that there is no incentive to run a node.  **It is the nodes that make it difficult to cheat, not the computational power.**  If there are few nodes and a big pool then the pool can simply buy out/bribe a good number of nodes and then allow a few large double spend operations to pass through.

This is my full disclosure to keep the drama to a minimum:
First of all, there is some history here.  So when my posts were pulled four times, it was difficult to know if there was a personal grudge, a spam filter, or just simply someone pulling links for political reasons.  My mistake: I made the mistake of calling Hub a troll based on his post [here](  I'm human, my buttons can be pushed and I misjudged.
My actual first post to the moderators:


Hub's response:


Perhaps you could make a self post and just say say why you believe the price is moving the way it is. If you keep it concise, well written and lay off the ideology, you'll probably get a good discussion going.
I figured that the spam filter had been updated, so I deleted my post and re-entered it.  It then got a few comments and then it was removed again, which prompted a third post.  I posted [this]( because I was frustrated ([Thorbinator]( took the screen shot).  This was also removed.
I sent another request to the moderators.  Since I don't have the screen shot like the first message I cannot quote what I said, but it was along the same lines with more questions as to why both links were removed. (For some reason, messages to moderators do not show up in the sent box.)
Hub's response was:




I haven't pulled either of them but I also don't plan on pushing through anything that isn't related to Bitcoin. I just don't accept that Ayn Rand's thoughts constitute a philosophy or are related to Bitcoin. And conversations about her ideas generally get nasty because of the polarity of views regarding her. Of those who know of her, a minority are fans and the majority hate her. Even the spam filter hates her but neither her views or yours are being suppressed.
Rand haters and groupies alike will give your views more time than they will hers. At least, I like to think the fact you're alive and actually a member here counts for something. Like I said last time, if you really think there was a salient point in that tract you keep trying to post, give a concise version of it in a self post. I'm not asking you to plagiarise but I am saying the direct route is better than a parable people have to search through and ponder the meaning of.
Since I felt kinda snubbed, but still determined to continue I posted: [What is your philosophical reasons for using BitCoins?](  Again this fourth post was pulled, but Hub caught it and since it met his criteria and he pushed it through.
Note that I never reached out directly to any specific moderator, I always messaged all the moderators at once.  I also attempted to contact two other users from to get a more balanced perspective (bkayh685 and cryptocoins).  I asked each for help in posting similar Ayn Rand links to see if the problem was really a filter or if it was a Mod pulling the links.  Neither responded back, so the only direct communications I had on this issue were with Hub.
Since I'm not privy to the communications between the Mod's, I cannot say exactly what happened with the shakeup, it simply looks like Atlas was not happy.

I believe it boils down to time and "bandwidth".  If you have $4k to invest, and someone suggests you invest $.10 in something with a $11 market capitalization and you have no or little understanding of the investment, what would you do?  There are two rational options:
1. Give the guy $.10.
2. Explain that you are busy and wish to be left alone.
If you give they guy $.10, he will likely tell his friends and you will be pestered for a lot more.  So, the only logical thing to do would be to ask the person to go. (or in this case, simply look elsewhere to invest).

Pumping and dumping only works if the group is small and growing, or unless you are big media. (No.  I'm not experienced, I can just understand what it would take.)
In order to move the price of something one way or another rapidly, you have to be able to manipulate enough people into the action you wish.  Try a few searches on Google trends.  For example, "Glenn Beck" and Bitcoins.  You will find the BitCoins is somewhat on par with Beck.  So there is a fair chance that the average Joe has heard of BitCoins.  In order to move the price lower, you have to convince all those people just now hearing about BitCoins to not invest, and those who have invested to sell.  In order to move the price higher, you would have to convince all those mining BitCoins to not sell, and those who have invested to not sell, as well as a whole lot of other people to start buying.  Based on how what Google trends is indicating, BitCoin is now reaching the main stream consciousness, and manipulation by a small group is not possible unless they are powerful media.
This is a good thing.  Now people can make up their own minds about this alternative currency.
@_date: 2011-06-27 18:24:53
I'm not sure where you got the quote ("only invest when you can put everything into one instrument"), so I cannot speak to that.
However, here is [Berkshire Hathaway's Cash on Hand](  Also, at the moment, BTC is going for about $17 each, and there are only 6.678M in circulation([bitcoincharts.com](  That gives BTC a capitalization of 113.5 M.  That is .27% of Berkshire's cash on hand.  If you were an investor with $4k to invest, would you bother looking at investments that cost $11? (4000*.0027=11)
@_date: 2011-10-06 18:39:38
Yes, those holding vast quantities will be able to manipulate the value.  That will be one of the long term disadvantages.  I've often seen this as a problem for gold, as its sources are limited (like platinum and diamonds) and thus can be controlled.  (Silver is superior in this respect.)  However, removing the fractional reserve problem would free up at least 30% of the wealth drain on our labor and a step in the right direction.

The only way to tie value to a fiat currency is to be willing to exchange it for something of intrinsic value.  However, most people are not rich enough to back a currency like that.
For example. If you wish to support BitCoin at one silver quarter per BitCoin, you would need to offer those silver quarters for sale at 1 BTC each, no mater how many people took you up on your offer.

I did a calculation once to determine the money replacement value of gold and if it were to be used as a world currency, it's current dollar value would be somewhere around $9k per ounce.  Gold and sliver prices are easily manipulated because they are traded in an electronic form where there are more outstanding contracts that there is physical gold and silver.  The recent Silver Liberation Army run up on silver prices was stifled by changing the buy and sell rules similar to when the Hunt brothers were purchasing silver.  (Don't ask how, because I don't remember what article explained it.)  When the rules were changed, there was less electronic buying.  This caused a panic and silver fell from around $45 down to it's current exchange rate of about $36.
Both gold and silver are easily manipulated because people are to easily scared when there is a major price drop and cannot demand enough silver psychical sliver to hold the manipulators feet to the proverbial fire.  If everyone kept buying physical silver even when the electronic price was dropping by 50%, then the scammers would be broke.  However, what happens instead is the scammers dump a buttload of unbacked silver contracts forcing the price down, and people panic and sell their real physical silver.

You are better off buying them.  I estimate it cost between 10 to 20 cents to create a bitcoin with a GPU.  Your hash rate with a CPU will be about 1/100 the power of a decent GPU.  Running a CPU to get BitCoins will be more expensive than if you just buy on the open market.
If you want to mine, your best bet is to research what ATI GPU your computer can support (based on your power supply) and upgrade your video card.  Be sure to give 10-20% leeway on power consumption, or your system will shut down at random intervals.  Doing this, you should be able to mine enough to pay for your video card in about two months.

It's nice to see others picking on the scalability issue.  It will need to be addressed before mainstream use.  The two solutions I see are as follows:
1. Branched block chains where the main chain becomes a record of the number of BTC in each branch.  Branch work is done on a per fee basis.  BTC can flow into and out of the main block chain.  Branches would be created to handle specific types of transactions or regions of trade.  The weak point is in the movement of BTC from a branch back into the main block chain.  When BTC is moved in this manner, persons wishing to cause problems could lie and say that a BTC transaction is real when it is false, or fake when it is real... The rest of the network not having access to the branch block chain would not know if the next block in the main block chain is fake or real....  The consequence would not be a double spend, but rather an interruption of BTC processing on the main branch, while the network identifies the IP's that are attempting to cause a problem.  A mechanism would be required to isolate the IP's that are causing disruptions so they can be banned.
2. Allow third parties to create manage transactions.  This could be done where the third party manages the transactions into and out of the main branch (that everyone can see).  The third party could also manage separate block chains to be transparent about the transactions they are performing.  The drawback is that these third parties could still simply skip town with the funds in the main branch.  The advantage would be that if the third party is honest, everyone can see exactly what is happening.
EDIT: If option 2 is used, there would be no need for changes to the main BitCoin block chain nor the BitCoin client, but rather the third parties would use the open source code to create new software that would manage new block chains to show what they are doing.
@_date: 2011-08-22 11:17:55
The issue of quick transactions is already being solved.  It will be done by trusting particular users to not double spend, and then tell the interface to accept the transaction.  This branch does not offer anything of great value other than the early adopter issues.
If you want to beat BitCoin you will need to create something compelling.  Consider the following feature suggestions:
* Make the system inflationary based on hashing power.  This will make the system fair to late comers and keep the value of the coins stable.  This would easily beat BitCoin, as it's value fluctuates to much.
* Add features where you can store/register things in the block chain.
* Add features where you can do cool things like anonymizing your transactions with other users.
* Solve the scaling problem that BitCoin will face in the coming years.
* Make it compatible with Tor or I2P and solve the Tor and I2P naming issues (e.g. NameCoin for Tor and I2P.)

This is basically a free option if you have $20k to invest for 2 years, with the following assumptions:
* Both the U.S. dollar and BitCoins don't drop in value. (e.g. The U.S. cuts access to the internet and destroys BitCoin AND the value of the dollar faces hyperinflation.)
* longbets.org does not walk away with your money in the case where BitCoin does not increase by 100 times.
Here is how you cash in on this free option:
* Buy $10k in BitCoins.
* Take the wager and put another $10k in the bet.
* Wait 2 years.
If the value of BitCoins drops to zero, you are not out any money, as the bet will cover your BitCoin loss.  In all other cases, you will profit.

Laundering is just another problem created by governments by outlawing particular drugs.  Unfortunately, most people are to brainwashed to see the root problems.  Use and sale of drugs are not immoral, simply not healthy.  Since everyone immediately thinks drugs are immoral, anything associated with drug activity becomes "immoral" by association.  Again, simply bad logic and brain washing.
Another false logic is that of associating that which facilitates illegal activities, must also be illegal.  Hence people feel hesitant about using BitCoin as it has now been associated with something illegal. "I might get into trouble."  Most people are such good "citizens".  A dictator could not ask for better followers.

Those that are making lots of credits, will not bother to solve these problems all day.  Those that are "unemployed" can "mine" these credits.  
This is sorta how gold and silver used to work.  When there was an economic down turn or the value of gold and silver got to high, people would go mine more.  When times were good, people would stop mining.  Also, if the value of gold and silver got to cheap, they would be used in jewelry or consumed in other methods. Thus the supply of money expanded and contracted so the unit value stayed about the same.

I would agree that an unstable value is an obstacle to BTC being used as a currency.  However, there has to be an initial increase in value as some sort of stability is reached.  Right now, it is just a question as to what percentage of all currency will BTC represent?  .001%, .01%, .1%, etc.  This percentage use of BTC to other currencies will determine its relative value.  50 million represents .000001% of all the world currency (1 millionth of a percent).  To me, 1 millionth of a percent is probably to small.

Yes, there would have to be some sort of incentive.  It would have to be built into the system, so it is either grafted into the BitCoin system or a new coin system.  NameCoin has already been created as a special case system, and it has its own coinage.
What I'm proposing is that there be some sort of generic block chain system... probably with it's own coin system, and then block chain branches off the main block chain to support special functions.  (There is another discussion someplace on the sub-reddit regarding sub-bock chains and moving funds between branches.)
Initially, the founder of BitCoin suggested putting domain names in the BitCoin block chain.  Ideally, a new generic block chain system could support more than just coin and distributed DNS.

There has already been an instance where stolen BitCoins were tracked, and someones BitCoin mtgox.com trading account was locked because of these BitCoins.
On the up side, you can always shift the coins to different accounts to obscure your identity, as there is no tie between your name and the numbers.
If you are worried about IP tracking, create a BTC wallet on a computer that is offline, and then copy the sending address to a memory stick.  When someone sends you BTC, have them sent to that address.  Eventually, when you want to spend your BTC, you will still have to connect the wallet to the internet so you can access the BTC, but you could use a public IP.  Make sure you encrypt the wallet and store it in a safe place.
Idea: You could have someone purchase the BTC for you, and give them a percentage of the purchase.

Looking through the block chain just after the crash I noticed this in the block chain.
* [Block 131886]( - about 5 to 10 minutes into the crash.
* [Block 131888]( - 2 blocks later.  Not as much, but still heavy moves.
So, the main big move was in block 131886 for around 432K BTC, and then a lot of other moves for around 56k BTC (eyeball estimates).  As stated, in order to move large amounts of BTC out of MtGox, the current price needs to be super low.  If the 432K BTC move was a move out of MtGox because of the crash, then the price had to be below $.01.  It had to be below $.0024 in order to pull that much BTC out.  Can anyone confirm that the price went below $.0024?
EDIT:  Other thoughts: If the hacker had access to a large number of accounts.  He could have made made everyone sell.  Then using the $ funds in the compromised accounts purchased back the BTC at an incredibly low price.  Finally, he could move the funds out because the price was super low.
@_date: 2011-12-21 01:08:10
I hope not.  I hope it moves slowly.  
If BitCoin is to have a lasting impact, people need to have confidence in it's value on a daily basis.  If the price can move as much as 50% in an hour, it destroy it's usefulness as a medium of exchange.  Think about it.  If you are a buyer and your BTC increased 50% in one day, would you think twice about exchanging the BTC for goods or would you think "I'd better hold for a little longer until this move is done."  On the flip side, if you are a seller of goods and the value drops by 50% in one hour, you may turn the buyer away until the downward move finishes.
If BTC is to reach the $20, $80, $100, or $1000, mark, it has to have slow steady progress over a period of years so people feel confident they are not being cheated when exchanging with this new system.  **Posting about the technical aspect of the graphs and what not only serves to appeal to greed or fear.**  Greed or fear makes the value fluctuate wildly and destroys the long term potential of BitCoin by destroying the trust in it's value.

However, we live in a world where powerful people have agendas and will look for ways to subvert that which gets in their way.

Therefore, care needs to be taken to sidestep potential subversions before they happen, be it fair or unfair.

I think there are traders/speculators out there that know there is an emotional reaction to the BTC price.  It is sort of like a positive or negative feedback loop that allows the price to be manipulated.  It is sort of like an electric door that responds to a little force by opening up all the way.  If you give it just a little push, it moves a long way, but still has to travel back to reach the equilibrium point.  Even though the energy required to start the movement is small, the energy it expends is 10 to 20 times greater.

Sudden increases in value attract speculators that push the price up (or down) rapidly past the equilibrium.  It will be the scurge of BitCoin for some time until we find a stable use.
For example.  Assume the normal price is around $5 per BTC, but it is trading at $2.5.   The price will move to $5 in an orderly fasion, but because the price is moving up, speculators will hop in and bid it up past say $20 because of a positive feedback loop.  As soon as things start to fall apart, the price will plunge back to $5 and again because of the negative feedback loop it will fall past $5 to say $2.  This will have negative consequences for BitCoin because people cannot properly price their products in BTC.
So, the best thing that can happen is a very slow increase in value so as not to attract speculation that screws things up.

Basically, if you make the number of coins issued based on the block difficulty.  When more people mine, the block difficulty increases.  At some point, it is not profitable to mine and people would back off mining.  In effect, the currency would be pliable, expanding when there is increased demand for the currency.  This would not solve the problem of a drop in demand for the currency (I cannot think of a way to contract the number of coins...), but at least it would avoid the major bubble problem.

Bad idea.  Only invest what you are willing to lose.  **Taking out loans to pay for BitCoins is insane.**  There are potential problems with BitCoin.  For example, in Syria, they turned off the internet.  Other countries have done the same.  I recommend tossing $50 to $100 into BitCoins, as the rewards will be good enough.  2 to 5 BTC when valued at 1% of the world currency is around $40K to $100K.  And if it fails, you are only out $50 to $100.
Better yet, invest a small portion of your income every month into BTC... say 1 to 5%.  That way it is not a big shock if it fails.

1. Bring cases against BitCoin operators for money laundering.
2. Send stories to the press about BitCoin and associate it with money laundering.
3. If public reaction is favorable use existing laws to railroad BitCoin operators.
This would have the effect of:
1. Casting doubt as to the BitCoin's legality.
2. Causing massive fluctuation in the value of BTC which will make it less useful as a means of exchange.
3. Cause users of BTC to move underground, rather than staying around as a legitimate means of exchange.
It would probably not shut down all BTC operations, but rather destroy or damage the purpose of BitCoin.

Gold and silver tends to be a better forms of exchange over time because they are found almost everywhere on earth, and when the value gets to high, people can resort to mining.  Thus, the value of gold and silver tend to stay balanced over time.
With regard to gold vs. silver: Since the majority of gold has been confiscated over the years by governments (including the U.S. government), and the majority of rich gold sites have been claimed or mined out, a return to the gold standard will probably result in a wild fluctuation of value like BitCoin has been going through until the distribution becomes more even.  Also, since there is less gold, it is a preferred coin for the wealthy bankers, as silver would take up to much vault space.  This concentration of gold lends itself to manipulation by insiders.
A better medium of exchange would be silver (assuming the internet is down and BTC cannot be traded).  The sources of silver are harder to control, silver is much more readily available, and silver has more industrial uses than gold.  Thus the value of silver will be more steady than gold and would be more resistant to manipulation by insiders.
If you want to know more about the silver vs. gold issues, search for "silver and the wizard of oz".

Government support of Bitcoin is unlikely as the current currency model allows government to borrow (create money through the Federal Reserve debt system) without raising taxes.  Further, federal agencies deal in billions of dollars, where as the current market cap of Bitcoin is only around $250 million (.25 billion).  Any move by the government to buy a significant number of bitcoins would cause a huge spike in the exchange rate.
Now, if the objective of the government is to destroy Bitcoin without legislation, then buying huge amounts of Bitcoin to drive up the price and then dumping the coins would be a way to sabotage Bitcoin's long term viability.  This would basically be equivalent of a currency war.
Government agencies probably have Bitcoin on their radar, but don't see it as a real threat yet.  If the market cap reaches the GDP of a small country, then things may change.

The best bet to combat the regulatory creep is to educate people on how the existing banking and monetary system is corrupt, and how politicians prostitute themselves to serve the industry.
* Supporting the dollar through war.
* Destruction of purchasing power.
* Government and banking collusion.
* Refusal of Obama administration to go after banking fraud.
* Banking bailout, but no homeowner bailout.
* Government "bailouts" were not needed.  Federal reserve could have changed reserve requirements and forced the shutdown of offending banks.  Instead existing congress saddled future taxpayers (the next generation) with debt.
* Collusion between banking and federal government removed Glass–Steagalll, putting depositors at risk.
* Fictitious "Drug War" created by the federal government has upended Mexico resulting in 50K deaths due to the drug cartels.  The drug war is used as justification for spying on citizen's financial activities.  The supposed activity is "money laundering".  This fictitious crime is selectively prosecuted and when major banks engage in this activity, they are not prosecuted.

I would have to agree with the inflationists here.  Bonds are another form of financial capital investment, and they are a product of the inflationary system.
What you should be arguing here is the differences between economic growth in an inflationary system vs. growth in a deflationary system.  Both will have growth, but stop and think about how that growth happen in both systems.  Who is harmed and who benefits?  My argument is that the rich will always pick the path of maximum self interest.  While the poor are impacted differently based on the system in place.
In a deflationary system, the emphasis is more on labor than on physical capital.  While there will still be incentives to turn financial capital into physical capital, the investments will be fewer.  This gives the lower class more leverage as society must depend more and more on their work.
In an inflationary system, the emphasis is on turning financial capital into physical capital and to reduce or remove labor.  Labor is pushed to the side and finds less opportunities to compete as the financial capital has taken over and is incentivised to overproduce to compensate for an inflating currency.

It's not about the hacks.  If there is no underlying trade, then you have a bubble.  Just about anything can burst it.
The real question is: "How can you tell if it is a real increase in value, or simply over speculation?"
Possible measures:
* Is the number of trades increasing according to the exchange rate?
* Is there an increase in the amount of news stories proportional to the increase in value?  (check the media and Google trends)
* Is there an increase in the number of vendors proportional to the increase in value?
I'm beginning to think this increase in value is real, but worry that speculators will go into a feeding frenzy and push the value up well beyond the actual value.  I would encourage everyone to tell people that get excited about the exchange rate to be careful and only invest what they are willing to loose.  E.G. Buy and forget.

Bitcoin is politically charged and closely associated with the ideals of various groups.

Corporate psychopaths depend on the perception of others to survive.  If you are a manager or have worked your way up the corporate ladder, you are much more likely to be psychopathic or borderline.  If you are not, your success depends on dealing with those who are.  So, I'm not going to suggest you are, I'm simply trying to side step the issue.


From the reading and documentaries/video's I've watched, I gather that your approach is a correct solution, but it involves strong character and sense of self.  The reason it is an attack is because psychopaths have their own masks that they must maintain to cover for their lack of character and empathy.  By calling them on a lie, you threaten to remove their mask and expose them to everyone.  This threatens their livelihood and whatever ambitions they have.  Because they cannot depend on a sense of "fair play" (that part of the brain does not function), they spend an inordinate amount of mental powers perfecting this mask.  You or I have only to access the part of our brains that allow us to imagine ourselves in someone else's shoes.  Thus, what seems like a proportional response to you is actually a threat of thermonuclear war.

Be sure to look at how the ripple.com code clears transactions.  While you don't have to copy the ripple model, there probably something to be learned about how they keep track of balances in a p2p system.  It is based on an open trust model that can be verified in a tree structure every minute or even quicker.  Nodes that cheat or make a mistake are quickly identified and weeded out.
If you are doing a distributed system, there will still have to be trusted and recognized individuals that can hold paper currency, as well as individuals that can hold bitcoins.  It may turn out that ripple.com has the correct model, and all you have to do is build on it to produce the desired system.

I've touched on this before.  $.04 is cheap, and I've set my clients to send $.14 (.002 BTC).  If you take a look at the logic below.  I think the logic can be incorporated into the clients as a default fee sent.  Miners can incorporate it as a rule.  Nodes (clients and miners) can use it as an extra preference to prefer blocks that meet the rule (e.g. delay transmitting blocks that contain fees below the threshold and prefer blocks that meet or exceed the threshold.)
From My Prior Post:
I was suggesting a few days ago that there be a guaranteed fee based on an algorithm.  Those transactions paying this fee would be assured their transactions reached the block chain.  The algorithm would attempt to accomplish the following:
* Charge higher fees for larger transactions.
* Charge a lower % on larger transactions.
* Charge lower fees for smaller transactions.
* Charge a higher % on smaller transactions.
* Account for increased value of bitcoins.
(Some of these sound contradictory, but when you see the examples, you will understand.)
The basic idea is two calculated fees added together to accomplish the above objectives.  One calculation is based on the average number of bitcoins per transaction (ABT) in the last 1000 blocks (or whatever number of blocks it takes to change the difficulty).  The other calculation is the based on the current number of bitcoins to be sent (BTS).  The result of the two would be added together to get the transaction fee, which would accomplish the above objectives.  The multiplier (MT) can be small so that it would still be very reasonable to send bitcoins. Here's an example:
* ABT:  2 BTC     (About $100)
* BTS:  .02 BTC  (About $1)
* MT: .0005  ( .05% or half a tenth of a percent)
* FEE:  2*.0005 + .02 * .0005 = 0.00101 BTC ( About $.05 )
5 cents to send $1 is a fairly good deal, considering that MasterCard and Visa probably charge merchants around $.5 to do the same thing.  Note that the percentage of the transaction is around 5%, so it would discourage people from spamming lots of $1 transactions.  Here's another example:
* ABT:  2 BTC     (About $100)
* BTS:  2 BTC  (About $100)
* MT: .0005  ( .05% or half a tenth of a percent)
* FEE:  2*.0005 + 2 * .0005 = 0.002 BTC ( About 10 cents )
Again, 10 cents is a good deal given that MasterCard and Visa probably charge $2 to $5 (2 to 5%) for the same transaction.  Also, most people would not think twice about this amount.  Also, the percentage of the transaction is .1%.  This is a smaller percentage than the first example, but is double the amount.  For the final example, let's look at a much larger transaction.
* ABT:  2 BTC     (About $100)
* BTS:  200 BTC  (About $10,000)
* MT: .0005  ( .05% or half a tenth of a percent)
* FEE:  2*.0005 + 200 * .0005 = 0.10001 BTC ( About $5)
Again, $5 is a good deal given that MasterCard and Visa probably charge $100 to $200 (1 to 2%) for the same transaction.  Again, most people would see $5 to make a $10k transaction as reasonable.  Note again, that the percentage is low, but the amount is higher for the larger transaction.
So what if you want to send 10,000 BTC ( $500k )and you don't want to pay the 5 BTC ($250) to shuffle the transactions around?  Well, you can still pay .1 BTC ( $5 ), and most miners would still accept the transaction because it is much more than the average transaction fee.  Also, note that as bitcoin continues to take off, the average number of bitcoins per transaction will decrease because the smaller amounts are now worth more.  This will lower the transaction fees for the first calculation in proportion to the value of bitcoin.
EDIT: Minor edit to correct "larger" to "smaller".  Also, in the last paragraph I mentioned that someone sending $500k of BTC could ignore the rules and still get the transaction through.  An alternative would be to change the guarantee rules to cap the calculation to 100x (or some reasonable multiple) the average transaction size.  A cap of 100x the average transaction size would put the cap for the above examples at $5.  A $500k transaction would cost the same as a $10k transaction, and would be guaranteed just the same.

CORRECTION on the price: I had the wrong price for 7-30-12.  The price of BTC around that date is around $8.7.  The dollar value would have been around $740.


I don't see where the "fuck off" is mentioned.  Are you the buyer?


Yes it is bad.  It highlights problems with shipping.  Any gold or silver seller will have the same problems, and rates for moving gold or silver will have to rise to reflect these problems.  I personally would be wary of Coinabul, but also of any gold or silver vendor because of these problems.

A few points:
* Bitcoin, gold and silver will be the yardsticks.
* Ripple will help solve Bitcoin's scaleablity problem.
* Silver and gold are currently manipulated via contracts to inflate or deflate the number of "coins".
* Bitcoin has an advantage over silver and gold in that everyone can see the total number of "coins".
* Drawback to ripple is that people will be able to do "fractional reserve" type operations where they promise more loans than they actually have.  Hopefully, this will quickly be discovered and those operating with these methods will be un-trusted.
My theory, ripple will complement Bitcoin.
Another point:
* Ripple can help solve the current exchange problem, where one exchange dominates the market.

You can easily root for your favorite by simply selling goods and services for that flavor.  If you hold a lot of xyz and you want people to value it, simply discount and people will hold it.  If you are an oil rich nation and you want people to use ABCCoin, then you simply sell oil for that currency.  Exchanges (or maybe and open source ripple) will do conversions.

I was suggesting a few days ago that there be a guaranteed fee based on an algorithm.  Those transactions paying this fee would be assured their transactions reached the block chain.  The algorithm would attempt to accomplish the following:
* Charge higher fees for larger transactions.
* Charge a lower % on larger transactions.
* Charge lower fees for smaller transactions.
* Charge a higher % on smaller transactions.
* Account for increased value of bitcoins.
(Some of these sound contradictory, but when you see the examples, you will understand.)
The basic idea is two calculated fees added together to accomplish the above objectives.  One calculation is based on the average number of bitcoins per transaction (ABT) in the last 1000 blocks (or whatever number of blocks it takes to change the difficulty).  The other calculation is the based on the current number of bitcoins to be sent (BTS).  The result of the two would be added together to get the transaction fee, which would accomplish the above objectives.  The multiplier (MT) can be small so that it would still be very reasonable to send bitcoins. Here's an example:
* ABT:  2 BTC     (About $100)
* BTS:  .02 BTC  (About $1)
* MT: .0005  ( .05% or half a tenth of a percent)
* FEE:  2*.0005 + .02 * .0005 = 0.00101 BTC ( About $.05 )
5 cents to send $1 is a fairly good deal, considering that MasterCard and Visa probably charge merchants around $.5 to do the same thing.  Note that the percentage of the transaction is around 5%, so it would discourage people from spamming lots of $1 transactions.  Here's another example:
* ABT:  2 BTC     (About $100)
* BTS:  2 BTC  (About $100)
* MT: .0005  ( .05% or half a tenth of a percent)
* FEE:  2*.0005 + 2 * .0005 = 0.002 BTC ( About 10 cents )
Again, 10 cents is a good deal given that MasterCard and Visa probably charge $2 to $5 (2 to 5%) for the same transaction.  Also, most people would not think twice about this amount.  Also, the percentage of the transaction is .1%.  This is a ~~larger~~ smaller percentage than the first example, but is double the amount.  For the final example, let's look at a much larger transaction.
* ABT:  2 BTC     (About $100)
* BTS:  200 BTC  (About $10,000)
* MT: .0005  ( .05% or half a tenth of a percent)
* FEE:  2*.0005 + 200 * .0005 = 0.10001 BTC ( About $5)
Again, $5 is a good deal given that MasterCard and Visa probably charge $100 to $200 (1 to 2%) for the same transaction.  Again, most people would see $5 to make a $10k transaction as reasonable.  Note again, that the percentage is low, but the amount is higher for the larger transaction.
So what if you want to send 10,000 BTC ( $500k )and you don't want to pay the 5 BTC ($250) to shuffle the transactions around?  Well, you can still pay .1 BTC ( $5 ), and most miners would still accept the transaction because it is much more than the average transaction fee.  Also, note that as bitcoin continues to take off, the average number of bitcoins per transaction will decrease because the smaller amounts are now worth more.  This will lower the transaction fees for the first calculation in proportion to the value of bitcoin.
EDIT: Minor edit to correct "larger" to "smaller".  Also, in the last paragraph I mentioned that someone sending $500k of BTC could ignore the rules and still get the transaction through.  An alternative would be to change the guarantee rules to cap the calculation to 100x (or some reasonable multiple) the average transaction size.  A cap of 100x the average transaction size would put the cap for the above examples at $5.  A $500k transaction would cost the same as a $10k transaction, and would be guaranteed just the same.

Further, if you look to examples of failed governments, you'll see that communism, and socialism also failed.
It's not that the rise and fall of nations is about a natural phenomena (it's not), but rather "Why are there groups seeking to subvert nations?", "Will this continual corruption ever end?", and "Is all unending turmoil worth it?".

Ok.  There's your misconception.  The coins would have only one PTS assigned to them.  The idea is that before you go to a merchant, you find a real PTS and you send your coins to an address that would require two signatures... yours (the CO) and the trusted PTS to spend.  Once this is done, another "shady" PTS cannot be attached to the coins, nor can you get the trusted PTS to sign another spend of the coins (unless you can corrupt them through a bribe or other means).




Then your statement "On the contrary, the Green address system doesnt rely on the behaviors of the third parties" is false because you depend on a third party for the private key.  Basically you are putting your coins in an escrow service that could either leave the country, or accidentally become the victim of a hacking attack.




So now we are back to the full trust vs. partial trust issue.  We know from experience when institutions are trusted with huge amounts of money, eventually can be corrupted.  However, if we can put a partial trust system in the network, then the risk for the CO goes away.  The merchant still has a little risk, but it is mostly mitigated by a third party signature.
EDIT: Formatting correction.

The title "Justice Department" is an misnomer.  It is more correctly labeled "Injustice Department" for it's duplicity in applying the law.  It ignores fraud by major banks, and only fines large corporations for major infractions of the law.
Further, we should be asking why Liberty Reserve is being charged with a crime.  If the charge is "money laundering" (a made up crime that should really be "aiding and abetting"), then this "department" should provide proof that Liberty Reserve knowingly assisted in criminal activity.  Further, there is something in the "due process clause" that should not be ignored:
* [Fifth Amendment]( - No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.
* [Fourteenth Amendment]( - Section 1. ... nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
The so-called DOJ charges that: "The company’s very purpose was to launder its users’ criminal proceeds through the U.S. and global financial system."  In actuality, U.S. money laws give people little privacy and banks often share private details and provide little in the way of low cost means of paying people privately.  Liberty Reserve existed to serve that community.  Unfortunately, this means that a portion of the funds going through Liberty Reserve will be criminal money, just as cash would be used for criminal activity.  This charge is unsubstantiated, yet the "department" seized assets and shut down libertyreserve.com without due process.
You may also note that a prior electronic currency E-Gold was imprisoned for cooperating in good faith with government agencies when notified of illicit activities.  **Basically, there is no "Justice" in the so-called "Department of Justice".

If I can deposit $100 and get 5% interest without any extra effort, then there is a time value to that $100.  However, if there is a barrier making it cost prohibitive to get 5%, then there's no real time value on it.  For example, if the minimum deposit is say $10,000 to get 5%, then the time value is moot.  Another example would be the paperwork required to get 5%... if it takes 5 hours to fill it out, then what's the point?  In these cases, there is no opportunity cost, because it would have not been worth investing the $100.  Thus, the time value would be zero.

What is your definition of a node and why do you think it should be responsible for verifying the integrity of a PTS service?




I would agree with your "uninvolved" modifier.


Exactly!  The Bitcoin protocol already has this built in.  It would mean that in order to spend the coins, both parties would have to sign the coins.  If you are one of two people who have to sign to spend the coins, then your signature is not enough to spend the coins. What I'm proposing is a modification to the double (actually it is multiple) signing logic that would do about the same thing, but only for a limited time.  After a period of time (say a day or a week), the second signature (the PTS) would not be required to spend the coins.

"money laundering" is a made up crime, just as "terrorism" is... at least the way government agencies toss around the terms.  Terrorism in the common definition is violence with the purpose of making people afraid, usually in the realm of warfare.  Government has made up the definition of terrorism as "breaking the law to make a political point".  This definition can be used to label peaceful civil disobedience as terrorism.  Anyone with a brain can see the absurdity of this charge.
"money laundering" in common terminology is basically aiding and abetting.  However, by specifically making "money laundering" a boogie man, government agencies extend that crime to include anyone who does not register with their pre-approved systems, and then goes about violating the privacy of everyone.  I'll re-assert that the crime of "money laundering" is made up and only serves as a mechanism of unjustified control.

Yes, this is true.  But it is important to keep people from being burned by a price drop.  If you buy at 30 and it drops back to 15, but you've only invested say $100, it's not that big of a deal and you may continue to dabble and buy things with those coins.  However, if you've invested say $20K at $30, and it falls to $15, you are going to have a very bad opinion of Bitcoin and will probably avoid using it in the future.
The point is, for long term acceptance of Bitcoin, we need to temper expectations so as to minimize the number of people burned by exchange fluctuation.

My understanding is that currencies between countries are not subject to capital gains taxation.  For example, if you were to exchange your money to Euro's and then the value of the Euro increased drastically, then you exchanged back, there would be no capital gains tax.  If, however, you were to buy gold and silver and the value of the dollar dropped drastically, or the value of gold and silver rose, then you would be subject to capital gains tax because gold and silver are not classified as money/currency under the current tax system.

Basically the same thing.  In essence, as long as those borrowers don't actually withdraw the funds, the reserve requirements are met, and more can be loaned out.  I simply look at it as: loans = (deposits/reserveReq)-deposits, or $5m/.1-$5m which is $45m in potential loans.

The problem with consumer grade operating systems is that the people who are dedicated to security and open source have no real funding to beat out the dominant operating system.  There needs to be a way to make a living contributing open source projects.
Now that Bitcoin exists, perhaps someone will invent such a method.  Perhaps it's a technical support system where those needing questions answered can pay for access to a knowledge base where 50% of the revenue goes to paying open source contributors.

Fingers decided they knew more than my brain.
Basically, the daily average transactions on MtGox is around $1 million per day.

However, people typically sell below the wall... thus I was estimating 1 to 2 weeks.

* In-fighting with the developers of Bitcoin where some psycho gets control and makes unpopular decisions about the code direction.  This will drop the price and probably branch the protocol.  End users would have to decide which branch is valid and what transactions to recognize.  Those holding the unfavorable branch would lose value.

This is the distinct disadvantage that free thought and individualism has.  Psychopaths work by infiltrating a group and then spreading rumors behind peoples back.  They find division and chaos to their advantage because then they can then gain more power, or hold on to the power that they currently have.
If you look closely at OWS, you will see that they are attempting to create a new social norm that is conscious of social justice issues.  They realize that consensus is key.  If you pay attention to how OWS is operating, you realize that they are using techniques to thwart infiltrators and to build social bonds.
The documentary ["I am Fishead"]( gets to the true root of the problem and explains how psychopaths work.  I highly recommend watching it.  Once you have, start asking yourself how society can be structured to combat this problem.  You start realizing that Libertarians have part of the answer... decentralization or weaker central government.  OWS has the other part of the answer... tight social bonds that thwart division.

Ideally, if it were gold and silver, a deflationary period would encourage mining of gold and silver because other methods of obtaining money would require more effort or work.  As gold and silver flooded into the market, there would be inflation and the reward for mining would decrease.
With the banks practicing fractional reserve banking (a practice that is fraudulent), these signals to mine or stop mining are screwed up.  Get rid of fractional reserve banking and let nature give the correct signals, things will correct naturally.
NOTE:  This is the one thing I have against Bitcoin.  It is ridged in its application of distribution.  There are no checks and balances to deal with periods of high and low currency demand.

The original logic would say that the non-cosigned might be locked into the block chain, but the cosigned one would still override the original.  Also, there was an afterthought to this logic that would make it simpler to avoid this complicated logic.  
1. CO sends the coins to a PTS address.
2. The PTS address cannot be spent without the cosinging of the PTS service for x days (make it a week or a month).
3. CO find a product from a merchant, signs the coins.  The PTS sees the signs the coins, ans co-signs the coins, once and only once.
4. CO sees that the PTS singing and that the coins are within the required PTS co-signing window.  The merchant can now trust that the coins will not be double spent and releases his goods and services immediately.  


I don't think you understand that signing something requires a private and public key.  If the public key is recognized as belonging to a trusted source, then it does not matter if the cosigning happens over tor, over a sneaker network, or in the clear.  Hell, the merchant may even set up his own co-signing service for quick spending at his shop, and the CO's money would still be safe (although it would take time to release his funds).


Yes, green addresses don't require modification to the system, and thus are simpler.  The drawback is that you have to fully trust a third party with your funds, and thus I would dispute that its safer.
RE: micro, medium and large transactions.
As the network begins to half, the incentive to mine will decrease.  Eventually the network reward will be so small, that there will be incentive to preform 51% attacks to reverse transactions.  This means that there will have to be longer and longer waits to ensure that transactions are not worth a 51% attack.  While green addresses and 30 minute waits are good for the current scale of things, in a few years things will get more and more precarious and the advantages of bitcoin as an exchange system will start to degrade.  Go read about what happened to feather coin.
@_date: 2013-06-12 19:11:43
Merchants that don't require PTS will have to delay delivery of goods until the block chain is long enough that a 51% attack is not viable.  I guess I was not making that point clear in my original post.
Basically, the longer the chain is, the less likely a 51% attack is worth pulling off.  Thus introducing a PTS can assure a merchant that a double spend while a 51% attack will not change the outcome of the coin spend.

People are selling out Bitcoin to regulation.
"The sense I am getting is that the Bitcoin world is going to end up very heavily regulated. Many of those involved with Bitcoin here at the conference are talking compliance with the government. Even the Winklevoss twins brought this up as something that will be necessary. The libertarian dream of anonymity seems like a distant memory to this crowd. It will be name and social security number in the not too distant future for anyone trying to open a Bitcoin account to buy or sell bitcoins through an exchange. Thus, Bitcoin, if it is not completely closed by government, will be no more than a faster PayPal type system, with a fluctuating value. There's pluses and minuses to a fluctuating value. During a strong price inflationary period, because of its fairly stable supply, Bitcoin could act as a virtual gold---but with the one caveat that, because accounts WILL be registered, the government will have a pretty good idea of how many bitcoins you have and be able to demand you turn it over if they so choose---something they can't as successfully do with real gold that is buried in the backyard."
If this happens, what's the advantage of bitcoin over other forms of payment and value storage?  **Regulation is a trap.**

Ignore the guys who are hyping Bitcoin here.  Bitcoin is still VERY RISKY. The way I explain it to people is that there's about a 1/3 chance that the value will multiply by 100 fold, there's a 1/3 chance it will stay in a trading range, and a 1/3 chance that it will fail.  The odds say you should bet everything, but because there's a 1/3 chance it will tank, I recommend people only invest a small amount, as a small amount will still net you a nice amount if it takes off, and if it fails, you will not miss it.
As for betting a "car's" worth of value on Bitcoin, the real questions are:
1. Is your son mature enough to handle the loss of $4000?  Will he be O.K. taking the bus or biking?
2. Will that $4000 cause a major problem in the long term?  Will he be able to recover from such a loss?
3. If he won the lottery, what would he do?
Right now people are very emotional about the exchange rate.  There's another possibility that the $4000 will turn into $2000 in a day's time.  We've seen this type of things before, and if he's committed to this as an investment, he'll need to accept the drastic loss and hold, or he could end up kicking himself for taking a $2k loss when things recover and start up again.

There needs to be a mix, as depending on only one system of exchange can cause all sorts of problems.

Half true.  Loans issued become deposites that can be re-loaned.  Per Wikipedia... "[](


A $100 deposit can inflate the money supply by up to $900 if the reserve requirement is 10%.  This accounting trick allows banks to charge interest on an extra $900, while the rest of us have a decease in purchasing power.


If I simply hold cash, then my money is being devalued due to this "practice" through no action of my own.  I (or anyone else who holds dollars) am a victim of this method of banking.  Subtle, but none-the less, this is theft or more precisely legalized fraud.

The one thing the Federal Government was charged with via coinage and the commerce clause, and it fails to regulate in a standard manner.  Instead it delegates this "regulation" to the states and then makes it a federal crime to violate any state laws regarding money transmission.  So, fail in one state, and you face federal "crimes".

I've stated this before.  Any company that holds BTC for you should have a pre-arranged address (or perhaps more) where your coins can be released to.  This address should NOT change easily, and there should be a week or two delay with perhaps physical mail conformation.  This makes hacking online accounts difficult and problematic, because before they can take your coins, they have to change the destination address.  On the other hand, you can easily request the coins be released to your pre-arranged BTC address (or addresses) and access your funds within a few hours.

Ideally, we would jail people practicing Fractional reserve banking.  Also, I would disagree about the destructive power of bank runs when put in comparison to the great depression.

Who do you trust, and for how much?  For example, you may trust your family members for a several hundred to maybe a few thousand, and a close friend for $50 to $100.  You may trust your co-workers for about $5 to $10 each.  Each of these individuals may trust others for a variety of amounts.  Also, others may trust you for a few thousand.  If you start the network and it get's large enough, the software can calculate an exchange through a trust network.


What do you do when you deposit funds into a bank?  You trust institutions more than you do people!  How about the trust you put in the exchanges?  Ripple simply shifts the trust from institutions to individuals.  If it becomes large enough, people will realize how valuable "reputation" is and start thinking twice about their actions.


"Rome was not built in a day."  It takes time.  However, if you find a dealer on localbitcoins.com that is trustworthy, you might be able to set up a direct trust relationship where he can set up a credit system where you can buy coins over ripple.  He would deliver the coins later, and you would deliver the cash or $ later.

You missed the part about expanding the money supply and charging interest to do so.  If I hold cash, that cash is devalued due to no fault of my own.  It was the same for gold before the federal reserve.  When bank currency was "backed" by gold, the banks would issue more paper currency than they had in their vaults.  This is fraud, pure and simple.  In other cultures centuries before "modern banking" anyone attempting this was executed.


Some libertarians call taxation "theft".  I'll leave that debate to the hard core libertarians.  If you grant a government the right to print money, would you grant a non-government agency the same permission?  Again, this is fraud at the expense of all who use the currency.

Close enough.  There's more to the banking system besides the oil backing.  But the oil backing is what allows congress to "borrow" money and the Fed "prints"/"issues" the money back to congress if on private investors buys the "bonds".
In essence, in order to run the US government without inflation or higher taxation, outside countries must hold dollars for oil.  If that relationship between oil and dollars dissolves, the dollars will come flying into the market, causing inflation, loss of "borrowing" power, and in long terms, military power to "police" the world.

Not really.  The people who are currently in power always take as much power and "money" as the population will let them.  So it is really a question of how such an action would be perceived by the population at large.  Therefore, while a government agency might be able to do this right now, there are political consequences.  As long as those political consequences are high, Bitcoin is relatively safe from such actions.  Thus, it is important to not let the issue get muddied and sidetraced in such a way as to make such government action seem justified.

Labor-saving-devices are basically capital.  They are the means of production.  Machines, buildings, robots, computers, etc.  If the currency is deflating, you are less willing to spend that currency to buy capital equipment to save labor.  You are also less likely to invest in companies that cannot make a return that exceeds the rate of deflation.  This means more opportunities at the lower end of the wealth spectrum and labor (people) becomes more valuable to produce the needed goods and services instead of investing in things that save labor.
Overall, there would be a general slowdown initially, but as labor becomes smarter and develop their own labor saving devices or techniques production would ramp back up.  Basically, the opportunities would shift from the rich to the poor.  As the poor become rich, they will stop producing, and the new poor could step in and do the same thing.

Basiclly, with the threat of people loosing money when the banks get into trouble, people no longer trust the banks and are keeping physical currency.

I think there should be two mandatory transaction fees:
* .05 % of the transaction amount.
* .05 % of the average transaction amount for the last 1000 blocks.
If the average transaction is $100 of BTC and you send $1, the transaction fee would be (100 * .0005 + 1 * .0005) $.0505.  If you send $100 the transaction fee would be ten cents.  This would discourage transaction spamming but still let the little guy send transactions for a reasonable fee.  Someone sending $10k would be charged $5.05, which is still reasonable considering the CC companies would charge one or two percent ($100 - $200).  The moving average of the last 1000 blocks would adjust to reflect increased valuations in BTC.  As the value of bitcoin increases, the transaction sizes would decrease.  This has the advantage of:
1. Transactions are guaranteed to go through if the mandatory transaction fees are set.
2. Handling large blocks would become a viable pool service without the 1-5% take from miners.
This method could also be the guaranteed transaction amount instead of the mandatory amount.  Transactions that meet these criteria will be ensured to reach the destination address.  Fees below the calculated amount could be ignored.

You spend them for the common good of increasing the value.  By using the coins,you get others interested in Bitcoins.  Go look at what happened to silver a few years back with the "silver liberation army".  They were able to run the spot price up 100%, but since then, its fallen off.  The reason?  They did not actively get others interested in it as a currency.  Besides, if you buy your sandwich, and replace the coins within a few days, at most, you'll only spend 50% more, and possibly less on a $6 sub.... but who cares?

If the rules change and someone is following the old rules, what's the proper action of a regulator.

2. Give no notice and confiscate those who are now in "violation" of the quickly created new regulation.

In the case of the Iraq war, there was strong sentiment for bombing the crap out of an "enemy", and those who opposed war could not defend against such irrational hate.  (How could you argue against war in the face of such a public spectacle of terrorism?  Reasoning is lost to emotion in those cases.)
Keep in mind that public opinion can be maleable or flexible.  If a small group is highly in favor of a piece of legislation, and the rest are "against it, but not to concerned", then no-one is going to protest or ding a representative for passing it.  However, if the legislation seems unfair, immoral, and corrupt, then it will take more effort (money, favors, or cross political support) to convince a representative to vote for it.

To reach it's full potential, there will be swings in value due to either manipulation or world events.  As bitcoin becomes more dispersed, things will settle down.
As far as using it to pay for things, there are exchanges that allow merchants to take bitcoins and switch back to dollars without the risk of value drops.  This will help increase their value, but consumers will be taking on the risk of value drops.

Bitcoin in its present form is far less anonymous than cash.  Take for instance spending 1 BTC out of a 100 BTC address.  Now the person recieving that 1 BTC can see that you have at least 100 more BTC.  Further, if he does an analysis along with a database from MtGox, he can probably figure out your name address, and where you spend other coins.  Bitcoin is NOT viable for money laundering.  The applications of these rules serve no purpose other than to attempt to domesticate bitcoin.

The rate down looks more like slow panic sell than outright manipulation.  If you wanted to manipulate bitcoin, you could easily do it with around 20m.  Simply slowly buy up mining hardware and mine for 6 monts, then shock the system by dumping all at once.
The more I watch gold, silver, and bitcoin, its clear the dollar is being strengthened.  That's not to say it will stay strong.
There's one more factor I did not mention... that is that people are loosing interest.  Its no longer a new thing and trends.google.com clearly shows this.
I'm guessing we will reach bottom in about 1 to 2 months at someplace below $50, and it will hold for about 6 months to a year before starting another run up.

If bitcoin was not considered currency at the time, then how can it be fraud.  The intent is not shown.
Also, fraud involves intent to harm others, often for personal gain.  Who does this harm?  
Also, if the DHS or regulatory agency wanted compliance, based on changing definition of "currency", then the proper thing to do is to assume that the business may be honestly trying to comply.  In that case, notifying the business of the change and allowing compliance is the correct approach.  Instead, the DHS reached out with a heavy handed warrant which implies that the business was a target of criminal proceedings.
This is why I level the accusation of fraud against the DHS.  It is an intentional attempt to harm.

debit, credit, borrow, loan.  What happens when you give money to mtgox.com?  You establish a "trust" relationship, where you trust them with your money and your bitcoins.  


I doubt that.  Most early adopters, like myself, understand the banking systems fraudulent practice called fractional reserve banking.  It basically takes your deposits and lends them out multiple times over.  While it is possible for one person to replicate this, eventually it will catch up with him as people demand their funds back.  That person's reputation would be ruined.  The only reason the banks can get away with this practice is that the Federal Reserve will lend funds (by "printing" money) so that banks can cover their reserve requirements and avoid "running out of money" when depositors come around for "their" money.

That's the one part that turns some people off to ripple.  On the flip side, if the core code goes GNU, then there's nothing to stop developers from taking the code and removing the XRP requirement and modifying it so that you can send with XRP (quickly) or delay the operation with a CPU based hash to keep people from spamming the network.  My take on it is... let the opencoin people make some money, and then when it gets to expensive to send a transaction, then modify the code.

It would be cool if you could find out if the authors of ripple.com are going to market their site/tool to gamer's first.
The other thing I interested in is how the open source will licensed.  Will it fall under GPL or are ripple.com owners going to copyright it with full ownership?  If it falls under something other than GPL, I suspect that it will fail to take off, as many people will not wish to contribute to something that can eventually become closed source.

With the Cypress confiscation, people are wary of keeping money in the bank.

3. The customer cannot change the address without a 7 day wait.
4. During the 7 day wait, emails will be sent to the account holder notifying of the change.
5. During the 7 day wait, BTC funds cannot be withdrawn. 
6. During the 7 day wait, a notification pops up on the main login screen notifying the user that the sending BTC address is in the process of changing.

Mixing services do exist, but seriously, how much money can you run through such a service?  Not the hundreds of millions required to "clean" the money.  Also, if the mixing services only serve the questionable businesses, the coins returned will still have a much higher "taint value" than the average coins.  Take for example a drug lord who needs to wash say 200k BTC and the average user who just wants to mix 10 BTC to improve his privacy.  Even if there are say 100 average Joes, the taint is still 200 to 1, and the vast majority of the 200k will still be visible on the radar.
Yes, you can create addresses offline.  But you still send coins to that address, and moving the coins to that address does not remove the "taint".
These rules serve only one purpose, to track people.  This is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, and has nothing to do with money laundering.  (Note that this does not even touch the issues with regards to selective enforcement of existing money laundering laws, the morality of drug laws, and the how U.S. Troops protected poppy production, and actually caused a surge in production...)

Trusting yourself is a good idea. :)


So how did you get your bitcoins?  Most likely you trusted mtgox.com or some site where you sent money to exchange into BTC.  If you want to exchange out quickly or spend your coins for dollars, you will need to trust another system.  Ripple is proposing a network of trust, where you list the friends and family and how much you trust them for.  They then list their trusts, and on down the line.


Ripple is simply an accounting system that electronically takes care of recording transactions based on a network of trust.  ripple.com, itself takes no money (actually it uses a XRP credit of some sort to "pay" for recording the transactions... but the amount is super small).


Why do we need bitcoin?  The whole reason bitcoin exists is because the central banking system is corrupt.  When you have centralization, eventually the psychopaths worm their way into the system to take advantage of it.
The advantage of ripple is that when the trust network is built up, you will easily be able to spend almost any monetary denomination for any other denomination, as long as your trust network and reputation are strong enough.  You could also exchange (within ripple) one currency with another currency.

Been thinking of putting together a google ad that would tease people "Learn how to get out of jury duty...".
In any case, I would retort "The court will not get to use my mind and judgement without the weight of my conscious.  If you ask me to serve I will be judging the law, the situation, and the defendant.  If the court does not want this, then don't ask me to serve." 
Not sure if they can actually do anything about it.  Perhaps they could hold you in contempt, but then you could say that you relent and will judge without your conscious, and when the time comes, make up reasons the person is not guilty.  Trying to prosecute you for such action would require another trial, and they'd have a hell of a time explaining to the next jury about how your actions deserve jail time.

This puts Bitcoin between two potential regulatory nets.  If it becomes common to track coins, then those who value their privacy will find a knock on the door when they send coins from their IP over the network that cannot be traced.  If it becomes common for people to "launder" the coins to keep their privacy, then law makers can claim bitcoin is used for illicit activities and needs to be banned.
I vote for ZeroCoin or its equivalent.  Let the government agencies try to justify regulating Bitcoin based on it's money laundering, and then point out that the NSA and other such agencies have abused their powers and people are justified in trying to wash their coins to protect their privacy.

What I think will happen is that the existing bitcoin system will be replaced without adding more or new "coins" to the system.  Consider this...
1. Bitcoin-qt continues with the existing block chain and journaling system.
2. A new system of accounting for coin ownership is created that takes less computational power and is still distributed via some trusted P2P system. (e.g. it is scalable, quick and trustworthy)
3. Existing coins in the Bitcoin-qt system are sent to a pre-determined address that everyone agrees does not have a private key.  (e.g. SHA256(billOfRightsText) )
4. The new system recognizes the transfer to the special address as a signal to add coins to the new system.  The coins are assigned to the source address of the sender in the Bitcoin-qt system.
Basically, the number of coins can be preserved (no inflation!!!), and the original owner of the coins still controls his investment.

Yes, a few hours after the post I realized that allowing the CO to send a transaction to be recorded in the block chain and then to wait a time would pose more complications.  My last edit to the post suggested a simpler approach, which is to have an expiring secondary signature where the coins cannot be moved for a set period of time without the secondary signature.  Sorry if that confused you.






I'll be upfront about my experience with the bitcoin code.  I have none.  Also my coding experience dates back quite a few years, so I'm very rusty and would have a hell of a learning curve to get up to speed.






When you sign coins, do you actually give away your private key to the network to prove ownership?  My understanding of encryption is limited to PGP.  If you have a public key and a private key, you can sign something with your private key and the people can verify your signature with the public key, but still not figure out your private key.  If you use the private key enough times, there is a chance that the private key can be discovered via quantum computing, but that may be a while.  Am I wrong in assuming that this is the case for bitcoin?


If the PTS has a public address, the CO, sends their coins to a public address and to an address that they own.  (That is assuming that the Bitcoin works the way PGP does with regards to signing keys/addresses.)


Yes, merchants would have to make sure the coins are signed by both the CO and the PTS, and that the time left on the expiration would not allow a 51% attack.


If the expiration time is large enough, and the merchant would decline immediate transfer of goods if the time left on expiration is less than 1 or 2 days, then a 51% attack in combination with an NTP attack would fail, simply because the coins would be to deep in the block chain.




Don't measure time in day's, hours and minutes, measure time in the number of blocks.  If on average the number of blocks is 144 (1 every 10 minutes) and you want to have about a weeks delay, then 1008(7*144) will get you about that much time.  Block creators and validators would would see a single signed transaction as valid only after the 1008th block.  If the CO post or pre dates his transaction, it does not matter, as only the double signed can get in before the 1008th block.

RE "Tripe" comment: Yes, looking back, I would agree that I should not have used the comment.
RE: understanding of economics: Perhaps my comments don't show my knowledge, but I do understand the economics.  An ever increasing BTC currency will cause economic slowdowns.  But if you start examining this closer who will stop producing, you will find that the smart people who only care about making a nice life for themselves will stop producing once can retire early.  Those people who don't care about the easy life but have a passion for things will continue to create cool things even though it is not to their economic benefit to do so.  Those people who simply want money as a means to power will be dispossessed of their power because systems of scale cannot be created where they can control things.  People first starting out their lives will find it much easier to create enough wealth to survive and retire early if they so choose to do so.  Finally, with an "economic slow down", society will have a stabler base of localization instead of globalization which in turn means a healthier impact on the environment.

Services that hold BTC for users need to require an address when the user creates the account.  Here is what I think is good practice.
1. When you create an account you must provide an address that funds can be sent to.
2. The address will be sent $1 to verify that the recipient has specified the correct address.
3. The customer cannot change the address without a 7 day wait.
4. During the 7 day wait, emails will be sent to the account holder notifying of the change.
5. During the 7 day wait, BTC funds cannot be withdrawn. 
6. During the 7 day wait, a notification pops up on the main login screen notifying the user that the sending BTC address is in the process of changing.
7. For accounts that manage over $1000, an RSA key is required for login and sending of funds.

The point is that the banking and special interest groups have worked to put these laws in place.  They want to control the flow of money.  My point is to let them have this "control" but create pressure by creating a potential difference (e.g. huge arbitrage opportunities) that can be used to create demand for competition.  The existing players will end up spending lots of money and effort attempting to control everything.  By shaping how you buy or earn bitcoins, you can pit one greedy group against another and shape the outcome of a fight.
Basically, I'm suggesting that the bitcoin community think and act strategically to cause problems for regulators and/or corrupt interests without initiating direct conflict or violence.  Think back to how Saddam Hussein caused problems for the US dollar by switching from selling oil for dollars to selling oil for Euro's.  He did so at an initial loss in value.  However, because of his actions, the Euro actually increased in value and he made a better profit in the process.  The same type of strategical thinking and actions are needed by the bitcoin community to overcome impending regulatory gridlock being attempted by corrupt special interest.

Yes, this is sort of what I'm suggesting with my example.  If nodes delay the transmission of a poorly formatted block (one with very few transactions, or missing valid transactions) is delayed then it's chances of "winning" are diminished.  Your idea of block preference does the same thing.  If a node gets a poorly formatted block, it will take it, but if it then receives a better block, say a minute later, the node would replace it and "orphan" the poorly formatted block.
 
Also, if enough clients did this, the larger pool miners would have to start considering which block to build on... the early poorly formatted block, or the late block with more transactions.
All of this is starting to come to a head as the block size becomes filled with more and more transactions.  Bot net and distributed (non-pooled) miners will be facing bandwidth problems.  Pooled miners will have a distinct advantage, and the other miners may decide to just eject transactions in favor of simply getting the block reward.
EDIT: Spelling corrections.

Been following this for some time through the circles.  A guy by the name of Benjamin Fulford has been touting this change for some time.  This new currency will NOT be unregulated.  It is part of the BRICs plan, and I'm sure bitcoin does not fit into this plan.  Basically the [Bretton Woods agreement]( is nearing the end of its lifespan.  There are even reports of some bloggers being approached to help tout this new system.
While this is short term good news for the world in general, it is bad news for the U.S. power structure unless it pulls up to the bargaining table so that the new system can soften the landing of the U.S. system.  Otherwise, the U.S. is facing massive inflation and chaos.
How does this impact Bitcoin?  My take is that it will seek to oust any competing system so that it can benefit from the increases in wealth production.  Any true competition will only exist temporary so as to weaken the dollar.  Once BRICs gets moving, I'm sure those in charge will do everything in their power to subvert or outlaw competing money systems.

And history will repeat itself.  Banks did this with gold and silver prior to 1913.  They would issue paper currency that could be redeemed in gold or silver, but they issued more than exists.  The problem is that banks vying for customers would scare customers in other banks causing bank runs.  This would shut down their competition.
To solve the problem the sneaky industrialists created the federal reserve bill which passed in 1913, which created a central bank (the Federal Reserve) which would issue paper currency to back bank reserves.  What happened then is that the Fed inflated the currency followed by drastic contraction of the currency.  The result was the great depression, and the executive order requiring all citizens to turn over their gold in exchange for dollars.  This basically strengthened the Feds control over the money supply, as gold was the only major competition.
So, if we are wise, we will learn from history and not trust those who create fractional reserves, and demand BTC directly.

I tell people to invest just a little for selfish reasons.  Basically, if people invest so much (get greedy) they end up selling to quickly, then you end up with major swings in bitcoin values.  What I like to see is slow steady growth in bitcoin usage and value.  When people buy bitcoin and then sell for a loss, those people are turned off from buying or using more.
I would agree with your assessment that bitcoin is a good gamble because the potential outweighs the drawback, and that if you know what you are doing, investing a large sum is acceptable.  The problem is that people get emotional (greedy or fearful) based on the current value.  For those who can keep their emotions in check and can stomach the wild changes in value, I say go for it.  Otherwise, only invest a small chunk that you won't miss if bitcoin goes belly up.

Not quite.  Green addresses are fully trusted 3rd party addresses, like Mt. Gox.  If Mt.Gox gets hacked, or they decide to confiscate your coins and leave town, then you're screwed.
With a PTS service, your coins are never at risk of being stolen.  The only thing the PTS service does is to co-sign your coins.  If they fail to do so, you can still recover them after a period of time (a day or two from my proposal).
The only one really at risk is the merchant.  If an attacker (a CO) hacks a PTS service, he could attempt a double spend attack against a merchant by having the PTS service sign two different transactions against the same set of coins.

There does not seem to be more news, so it can't be that people are simply discovering Bitcoin again.  My theory is that because SatoshiDice has reported good profits, the rest of the online gaming industry is moving to capitalize on the idea of using Bitcoin instead of actual money.  This would open up many more markets.  The draw back to this is that people will soon start investing all their wealth into Bitcoin without caution, and then panic when it drops by 10 or 20%.

How would you define capital?  "financial capital" is money that has not been translated into physical capital (buildings, tools, computers, etc.) that improve productivity.  A deflationary currency will retard investment in physical capital, which results in a short term economic slow down.  If the deflation is severe as in the case of how the Fed tightened the money supply during the great depression, the economic slowdown is catastrophic.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, inflation can over work a population and work against its character and well being. (It encourages needless consumption and discourages savings.)
However, a predictable deflationary currency encourages the poor to save and be industrious instead of being wage slaves to large capitalist investors.  The playing field is much emptier to develop skills and innovations that will move the poor up the economic ladder.
An inflationary currency, flushes out those with lots of financial capital to invest in physical capital and push out the poor inventors.  Production increases, but incentives to invent and improve oneself fail because your life is basically stuck as a wage slave.  The poor cannot compete in such a market.  They simply become a commodity ("human resource") to be consumed.
The way I look at it, inflation produces quick anemic economic growth, and a stable or deflationary currency produces slow, stable and strong economic growth.

Words... always words.
"money laundering" is a made up crime.  To jail those handling money outside of the normal banking system accountable for the crimes committed by those obtaining illicit funds is immoral and unethical.  If I give you $10k that I obtained via a real crime, you should not be held responsible unless you can reasonably know that the $10k was part of a crime.  To assume you've committed a crime or to make up a new crime for not "registering" (e.g. asking for permission) for something as fundamental as handling money or goods is akin to punishing innocent people for the crimes of the guilty.
As the libertarians would say... Look for the "gun in the room".  Why do we have to ask the guy with a gun for permission (some government regulator) to exchange money?  If we have to ask, are we slaves or are we free?
I say, don't be fooled into believing LibertyReserve is guilty of a fictitious 'crime' called money laundering.  Instead look for the gun and ask yourself is the use of force against LibertyReserve moral?

The problem is that if people get burned buy holding bitcoin, there will be fewer people adopting bitcoin in the future.  Basically bubbles kill people's trust of bitcoin as a store of value.  That's why I encourage people to invest only a small portion of their funds in bitcoin.  If it becomes a global currency, they will still be rich, but there is less likely hood of a panic sell.  If people invest their retirement funds in bitcoin, they will panic on a pullback and sell to quickly.
@_date: 2013-08-31 08:40:10
You can also argue that the rich actually benefit more from inflation because they have the credit ratings that allow them to "borrow" from the bank which inflates the money supply.  The little guy has no such credit and cannot take advantage of the inflated money, but rather has to tread water and beg for raises while the rich get richer.  In essence the rich already have a form of bitcoin.  They are called stocks.  They buy these investments and they continually increase in value.

There will continually be people who will over-hype to push the exchange rate up, and then dump to scare people into selling low.  Until such a time that bitcoins are ubiquitous, these bubbles will be inevitable.
The sure fire way to keep your head is not to buy more that you can afford to lose.  Therefore, if you want to buy bitcoins for the purpose of investing only buy a small amount and then simply put them away for a rainy day.  If you have so much invested that bitcoins going to zero scares the shit out of you, slowly sell out until the loss is something you can tolerate.

XRP is more like NameCoin in usage.  While it can be transferred around, I suspect it was made this way so that everyone in the system could obtain some (and give some to friends) without a centralized place for obtaining them.  


XRP will never be able to compete for this exact reason.  Who the hell cares what the value of XRP is.  As long as it is cheap enough to facilitate transactions for now and into the foreseeable future, let OpenCoin make some $$ for their efforts.  If people are foolish enough to buy thousands of dollars worth thinking they'll get rich, that's their loss.


You sound like the people who decry bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme.  Stop and think for a moment about what they say.  "Bitcoin is unfair because early adopters get all the value."  
What about Mt.Gox?  Everyone hates them, yet they provide a service at a fraction of a percent per trade, and they've facilitated the growth of bitcoin.  Ripple will be able to provide a much more distributed network of trust that will be harder for regulators to step in and take over.  And if OpenCoin becomes to greedy by increasing the cost per transaction, then those working on the open source will find a way to replicate the network of trust and replace XRP.

There are good reasons for distrust.  If the Obama administration prosecuted Goldman Sachs over their fraud and did not put America further into debt because of this fraud, then the trust level would be much different.  Also, comments like "childish" only serve to inflame or derride people and detract from discussion.


Again, there is good reason to keep regulatory agencies out of the mix.  As can be seen by the U.S. money laundering laws, any regulation causes serious problems for Bitcoin.  Because the current government has been corrupted, the burden is really on those agencies to prove their methods will help and that the regulations will not be abused.  Right now, it is reasonable to assume government regulation will harm, and in some respects harm with intent.


Again, inflaming or derriding comments only serve to shut down rational conversations.


Bitcoin was created as a rebelion to the existing status quo.  It is quite reasonable that the Bitcoin community resist regulation as that regulation has failed to prevent harm to society and has actually be used against society in its efforts to correct the wrongs wrought by the banking industry.  Most of us here don't want regulation and are willing to deal with the risks associated with an unregulated currency.  This includes fraud, and computer hacks that result in bitcoin theft.


You know what they say about good intentions.




I have no problems with small banking firms and people who want to play in the Bitcoin realm.  What I have a problem with are people who use guns to enforce rules.  If your friends in banking want to create accounts for people who will trade bitcoins, that's fine because those interactions are voluntary.  But when you start introducing legislation or court rulings, you are dealing with people use use guns to get their way.  As the libertarians would say... "Look for the gun in the room."  What I'm basically saying is "WARNING: A gun is being moved into the room.".

Why should the individual nodes care?  It is the merchant that should care, not the nodes.


Again it has nothing to do with the nodes.  There's already logic in the clients/protocol to allow multiple signing, and a single signing of coins with a double sign would fail.  This is proof that a PTS system would work if the protocol were further changed.  **It is the merchant that must trust the PTS signer, not the network.**  If there were a lot of shady PTS signers, a merchant would treat an unknown PTS signing just as it would a non-green address... and wait until the coins are buried deep enough to ensure ownership of the coins.  If the merchant trusts the PTS, then the merchant can release the goods or services early.


Now you're not making sense.  Either I have a bad source of information or your argument is circular.  Please explain why a CO cannot double spend from a green address?  If you say a green address does not rely on the behaviors of a third party, then the CO **can** double spend from a *green* address... although at the expense of his reputation.  My source for how "green addresses" work is from the [bitcoin wiki](


This statement just contradicted the statement above.  If you use a fully trusted third party, you risk coin loss via hacking.  Just go look at the number of exchange hacks that have happened.

There are those who value bitcoin because others value it (skeptics), and there are those who value it because they are tying to change things (true believers).  The true believers have the power to change the price by their simple willingness to believe that bitcoin is worth more than the exchange rate.  The skeptics will jump into and out of bitcoin at the slightest change in wind direction.  The true believers have the ability to change reality, the skeptics are subject to it.  The true believers will profit, the skeptics will get burned by almost any investment they make.
If you want to make a difference, ignore the skeptics and simply offer goods and services that add value to bitcoin.  We change the skeptics' reality by believing we can change reality by simply believing the true value of bitcoins will be $200k each and by habituating people to take advantage of what appears to be fantastic deals (goods and services that are below the exchange rate).  Every transaction we can get people to preform creates a psychological infatuation with bitcoins.  People will value it because the true believers value it.

People and governments are smart.  If Bitcoin is hogged by Germany, there's nothing to stop the U.S. government from launching a new Bitcoin (open source, 21 million limit, etc.) but requiring taxes to be paid in this new Bitcoin.  We could see a whole variety of Bitcoins with the same limitations, but each tied to a government as a method of paying taxes.
A more likely scenario would be that Bitcoin continues to be the choice of online payments, and the dollar and other currencies continue to exist for other purposes.  For example, cash would continue to be used for brick and mortar store purchases, and automated banking would continue to fill the mortgage and bill payments.

So, how can raiding savings accounts be a method of saving the banks?  If you understand the mechanisms of fractional reserve banking, this would obviously be a way to make banks fail.  People would simply stop depositing funds and withdraw as much cash as possible.  This would essentially cause banking reserves to dry up and banks would have difficulties in holding their reserves.  Here are the consequences of raiding or threatening to raid accounts:
* Banks would stop lending.
* Banks could end up failing because they cannot cover their reserves.
* The money supply would contract.
Contrary to what most here think is happening to the money supply (e.g. inflation), this move will cause deflation (a strengthening of the Euro) at the expense of the banking industry.

The author is experiencing a paradigm shift, now that he's out of the rat race and "financially secure".  What is happening is that he's starting to see the world from a 1% viewpoint (at least the non psychopathic kind).  What needs to happen now is that those in this position need to start thinking less about their wealth and start thinking about the bigger picture.  For example:
* If bitcoins give you financial security what about "social security" (not the federal one)?  If society breaks down, your bitcoins will not be worth much.
* Unless psychopathic, I suspect the next "need" these new 1%'ers will have is contact with good people not interested in wealth.  How about keeping wealth hidden and traveling around the country with the occupy movement or joining some other groups that help build connections between people?
* What makes a good person?  Go watch "Groundhog Day".  What would you do if the rest of your life is paid for and time was not an issue?  What's really important?
* I've always thought that the main evil in society are the divisions between people: religion, politics, race divisions, wealth disparities, jobs, etc.  I believe powerful (psychopathic) people create and use these divisions, and are VERY adept at this tactic.  What would be the antidote to this?  Better education like critical thinking? Creating and getting people on a reddit type system to force people to think about opposing viewpoints?

The problem is that the banks have no valid moral argument as to why Bitcoin needs to be regulated, nor should we allow them that argument.  Without a valid reason for regulation, any attempt to regulate only exposes the system for what it is, and that is why bitcoin is so dangerous for the existing institutions.  It exposes their fraud, along with a simple non-violent way to fight back.

There is no doubt in my mind that the U.S. government has created back doors to Intel processors.  Governmental power systems are simply to driven to control EVERYTHING.  However, given how tenaciously they've gone after Snowden, and how the U.S. population is now very upset about the violation of the 4th amendment, this would be a very closely guarded secret.  The up side to all this is that they would have to be very selective about blatant use of this back door, as it would soon be shown that the processors are not secure and send buyers to look for alternatives.
As Bitcoin and other crypto currencies goes mainstream, however, there will be a new market for open source (verifiable) hardware, and software dedicated to exclusively to security.  This will further frustrate the already Nazi like control demanded by governments and will eventually cause them to overstep what people will tolerate.  Government's will wane in power back to their intended rolls and public servants.
My advise to anyone concerned about hacking and bitcoin would be to use an online Ubuntu system with a small amount of BTC to transact with, and keep the rest in paper wallets, or in an offline computer.

Positive news in combination with trending interest would move the exchange rate up.  But all the stories are now old news and interest is trending downward.  (See trends.google.com)  The only thing keeping the price from falling to fast are VC's that have been investing in businesses that can take advantage of the currency, and those investors who have good intel on what the future holds.  Both have been steadily buying and keeping bitcoin from falling like a rock, while the general population has lost interest and are dumping their coins.
When these new VC businesses come online, expect the steady downward trend to reverse as people see the advantages offered by bitcoin.

People lend money all the time without fractional reserve.  I could loan you an ounce of gold now, physcially give it to you and then expect that ounce back with interest in the future.
If you are referring to the ability to have both demand deposits and lending, then you are correct.  Such a system would be impossible without a fractional reserve system.  However, there is no need for that system, as you can simply buy a bond (issue a loan), and if you need to get money out now, you can simply sell that bond to someone else and get your money out.
Fractional reserve banking only serves to inflate the money supply for the benefit of those running the banking system.  They get to "create" money and then charge interest on that money created out of nothing.  It is nothing but legalized fraud.

As more money poors into bitcoin, it becomes more "fragile".  One mistake can cost millions/billions in value.  What is needed is some modification to the code or chain that will allow "experiments" in such a way that the developers feel safer about trying radical ideas.
Perhaps there needs to be a way to create branch chains that contain live bitcoins where experiments can take place.  Once the experiment is done, the branch can be stopped and merged back into the main chain.  The number of coins allowed to "move" into this temporary chain could be limited to minimize risk.  Users would be warned about the risks of moving coins into the experimental branch, and incentives could be created to get users to try the branch.

While I'll grant that there is a centralization of wealth in the bitcoin system, keep in mind that it is not nearly as terrible as a wealth drain on society that fractional reserve banking perpetrates.  The current system is based on debt which can never be fully paid.  Thus there is a built in defaulting system that gives up real assets.  So, if the average money supply in the U.S. is $14 T, and the average interest rate is 5%, that's 700 billion that's anally siphoned off in REAL assets just because the money exists.  Over a 50 year period, that's $160 T.  The dollar value of real assets far exceed the money supply, so by eliminating money as debt you plug this hole.  That's the real advantage of gold, silver, and other non-debt money supply systems.

Depends on the scale and configuration.  There are so many ways of organizing things that the word anarchy and government kinda get mixed up in the definitions.  
The main problems I see with "government" is that it is vulnerable to infiltration by the psychos (which is what is happening in the U.S.).  When you look at collectives, you usually see groups of say 100 to 200 people and they have their forms of loose rules/laws and ways of resolving disputes.  If such groups are tight knit, they will be relatively immune from infiltration by psychos.  However, such small groups are easily over run by nation states.
I think the mid point between Rand's ideal and the collectivist ideal would be standard business ownership for the objectivists and worker cooperatives for the collectivists, where the existing government structure is constantly checked by both entities.  But then again, there are so many fluid ideas about how to structure things that there may even be another amicable configuration.  The only thing I would hope is that everyone focus on keeping the psychopaths from taking control rather than fighting over minutia.  Fighting provides wedge issues that allow the unscrupulous to step in and take power.

The potential of Bitcoin is so huge, that you don't need to invest a lot to have a small fortune in the long run.  I once calculated that if Bitcoin were to suplant the U.S. dollar, each one would be worth $700k each.  That's not to say it will happen.  But if it does, it will take time.  A small investment of say say $100 (5.5 BTC) can easily turn into a few hundred thousand.  The key is not to get to greedy and invest more than will cause loss of sleep.

Legislatures can make up any law they want to.  One major problem is a question of appearing to be legitimate in their creation of the law.  Most everyone on this sub-reddit knows that there are no legitimate reasons for the rules you propose, so legitimacy in terms of what knows would not fly.
Another major problem is that of enforcement.  If everyone simply ignores the law, and there is no way to stop transactions that break the rules, then the rules don't mean anything.  It's sorta like the sodomy laws in various states.
The final problem is that of prosecution.  If juries reject your rules and invokes jury nullification, then, again the law means nothing.

True.  But let the big exchanges and merchants figure that one out.
If there's one thing that we should take away from the corruption of our governments the last 20 to 30 years, is that the profit motive is extremely corrosive.  We should use that to our advantage and let it eat away at those laws attempting to contain bitcoin.  
Think of it this way.  If everyone is willing to buy products in bitcoins at a 10% premium over cash, and people are willing to take a 10% or more discount for being paid for their labor in bitcoins, and the market for goods and services is $1 billion, that's a $100 million profit motive against the existing laws.  If the goods and services increase to $10 billion, that's a $1 billion profit motive against the existing laws.
BTC-E has already figured out that you should not deal directly in the transmission of fiat, and instead depends on existing money transmission services.  Imagine if Western Union quadrupled its business because of bitcoin.  Someone more powerful would start smelling blood in the water and look for ways to break into the market.  Either the laws would change, or someone would step in and offer a more efficient exchange method.  **All we have to do is vote with our "money".**

Satoshi Dice and other online gambling sites are built from the ground up to be secure from attack.  In other words, professional sites have considered the implications and have the funding to hire security professionals.
Think about the early days of bitcoin exchange sites.  How many have been hacked and have failed because of these hacks?  How many of these site owners now face legal problems because of the hacks?
If I were this guy, I'd limit the amount of BTC allowed by each player to say $25, and have a prerequisite BTC address to send funds to when the balance exceeds $100.  That would limit exposure below what someone would bother suing you for.

Not in proportion to what is currently happening.  Banks trying to use fractional reserve banking with a finite money supply would fail as soon as there was a "bank run".  Besides, with electronic currency, everyone could demand that the "banks" publicly show their accounts (in address form) to see the solvency and make sure they were not using fractional reserve banking techniques.
What makes "modern" banking systems so insidious is that fractional reserve banking is backed up by the Federal Reserve Act.  The act created the "Federal Reserve" with independent entity to "create" money when the banks don't have enough reserves to cover "bank runs".

Yes, but the "enforcement" should not be heavy handed or it destroys the legitimacy of those laws.  Those who are not the direct intent of the law who fall under regulations to thwart those who are the real target of the law should be treated with respect.  The real target of money laundering laws are those who attempt to hide their victim ladened profits.  The target for punishment should not be those failing regulation that would help catch real criminals.
By jailing, seizing assets and generally being dicks about money laundering rules, those who would gladly help law enforcement catch kidnappers, thieves, and other low lifes are now opposed to such regulation and question the legitimacy of government.  Basically the "cure" is worse than the disease.
In order for law to work properly, it has to be just, and it has to have the cooperation of the citizens who the law is subject to.  By using blatant, heavy handed (and probably bias/political/profit bank driven) tactics, the law loses it's moral force and meaning.
If the DHS and other government agencies are a moral force in society, then they need to work with new and innovative businesses to help them comply with moral laws and regulations.  Gradual ratcheting up of compliance notifications and assistance in complying with these regulations would be the proper course of action.
However, we don't see any evidence of this, so we reject the regulations and ruling as unjust.  What further degrades the moral force of the money laundering laws is how the big banks simply get a slap on the writs for laundering trillions of dollars while a lowly MtGox exchange that deals with a currency that is 1/1000th the size of a trillion gets hammered.  Basically, those "enforcing" the regulations are sucking the moral marrow out of the law.

Yes, I understand that.  When I say "who owns", it is synonymous with the public address in the block chain.  It is just easier to say "who owns" vs. "public address owned by the CO".


Good, I thought it was working that way.  If that is the case then the PTS can re-use the PTSaddr over and over without disclosing the private key.  This is in reference to your statement:


CO's who did not have an agreement with the PTS but sent their coins to a double sign address, would not get a double sign when they go to spend their coins.

Yep, I'm the OP.  The point is that the longer you wait, the deeper the transaction is in the block chain.  The deeper the transaction is, the more secure it is from a double spend attack while a 51% attack is in progress.  If the transaction is 20 blocks in, then a 51% attack to undo that transaction is going to take a lot more computational time than say 2 or 3 blocks in.

Max Keiser was the major spokesman for the "Silver Liberation Army".  Silver spiked at around $49 and fell back to around $28 where it is today.  The premise of the movement was that there was silver contracts that would bankrupt the people issuing these contracts.  It never happened.
Keiser is simply attempting to hype Bitcoin and push up it's value artificially.  His opening statements show the tactic perfectly:
"8 months ago if you recall on this show and on the Alex Jones show, I said that there would be a major financial catastrophe over the next 9 months and we've got it.  Bitcoin has absolutely triumphed the dollar has has crashed 90% against Bitcoin, as Bitcoin is set to take on the world and root out the banisters."
The dollar has NOT crashed, and Bitcoin is not yet ready to take on the world.  This is all just hype.  Be warry of Max and other talking heads that may be using media to P&amp;D bitcoin.  If you want to invest, do so in moderation and over the long haul, and keep in mind that Bitcoin is susceptible to these types of manipulations in value right now.

Regulation requiring tying bitcoins to people is a real danger.  Back in 1933, Roosevelt issued Executive order 6102 that forbid the holding of gold, and forced people to sell their gold at below market value for dollars.  If regulation is created requiring users to register their bitcoin addresses to government agencies, history could repeat itself.  Worse, if you happen to lose your private keys and you cannot relinquish your bitcoins, there is a real possibility that you could end up in jail.
Imagine a scenario is that if your coins are registered and you decide to take a vacation to another country, you could end up on a no fly list unless you surrender your coins.  In essence, your wealth now becomes hostage to government agencies.
Another problem with disclosing bitcoin ownership is that governments frequently disclose your personal information with banks, and this private information could be used for any number of nefarious purposes if it falls into the wrong hands.  Frivolous lawsuits, extortion, rubber hose attacks, and kidnapping can all now be accomplished with this information.
Fungibility becomes a real problem with this type of regulation.  If your bitcoin exchange decides to start accepting questionable coins and your coins become contaminated, now you will not be able to spend your coins.
As much as some new people in the bitcoin movement may decry the need for regulation to thwart real threats to society, one must remember that regulation also represents real threats and dangers to society.  Don't be fooled by the regulators.
@_date: 2013-06-12 18:32:08


Yes it can.  If the coins are sitting in an address that is owned by the CO and has a PTS requirement the logic would say that coins signed only by the CO have to wait 144 blocks before the block chain will allow spending of these coins again.  A merchant seeing this would wait to send goods or services to the CO for at least 1 day to ensure ownership of the coins.
If the CO single signs the coins and then tries to spend them again with the PTS as a co-sign, the block chain would mark the prior transaction as invalid and PTS signed one as valid.  Transaction fees may need to be figured out for the original single signed coins or else miners would ignore all single signed transactions for fear of not getting their fees.

True.  But what if QC exists, or what if it is developed and no-one is told?

The actual cost of transmitting one transaction across the network is probably greater than 5 cents.  Also, there is a problem with a few lottery type sites that spam the network with transactions.  Discouraging this type of activity helps keep the blocks smaller.
If 5 cents is to much then there's always the option of using offline exchanges to clear transactions and then settle up later.  Take ripple.com for example.  They've got the right idea.

I think the current value may actually reflect an increase in use.  However, the ramp up in value may cause a feeding frenzy that will push it way over the actual increase in use.  
As always, if you are speculating or investing, don't play with more than you will regret losing.  If you find people who are excited about the price and want to buy more, please caution them.  Why should we discurage people from buying a lot of Bitcoin?  Here's my reasoning:
If someone buys in at 30 and it drops back to 15, but they've only invested say $100, it's not that big of a deal and they may continue to dabble and buy things with those coins. However, if they've invested say $20K at $30, and it falls to $15, they are going to have a very bad opinion of Bitcoin and will probably avoid using it in the future.  The point is, for long term acceptance of Bitcoin, we need to temper expectations so as to minimize the number of people burned by exchange fluctuations.

Banks make most of their funding through fractional reserve lending.  The fees are just icing on the cake.  They can lend money up to the reserve requirement.  In effect, they create money by issuing loans greater than the amount of actual cash in their vault.  If there's a "run" on the banks, then they go to the Fed to "borrow" money to cover their reserve requirements.  This is what makes the average bank so profitable.  
In essence, if you have say $5 Million deposited into a bank, and the reserve requirement is 10% (actually it is insanely low now days... like 2% or 3%), the bank can loan up to $45 million.  If the "interest" you charge is 5%, then you get $2.25 million per year in interest from loans you issue.

The value of money is a bit fuzzy.  Giving relative sizes gives us a better feel for how large $50bln is.  For example, the approximate value of all stocks on the U.S. stock markets is around $16 trillion, approximate number of dollars (M1, M2, and M3) is around $14 trillion, the GDP is around $14 trillion, and the U.S. public debt is around $17 trillion.  So $50bln represents the currency of a small or 3rd world country.
*  - could not link to this because of the ending ")", but it gives you a feel for what $50bln represents in terms of economic power.


With fractional reserve banking, the answer is... no.  But then again, that's cheating the system because it expands the money supply and everyone holding that currency sees a decrease in value.

If miners can set their criteria for transactions, can bitcoin clients set criteria for accepting blocks?  What's to stop client writers from refusing or delaying sharing of blocks that refuse to add transactions in favor of blocks that do?  In other words, if a miner creates a block that only has 5 transactions and passes it on to 8 nodes, those 8 nodes could simply hang on to the block or delay it for a few minutes before sharing it.  This would encourage miners to behave in the desired way.

The upside potential of Bitcoin could mean 100 to 10,000 times return in 5 to 10 years, depending on adoption.  There is, however, distinct possibiliites that bitcoin might be taken out via government action, technical glitches, or massive hacking attacks.
Think of the odds this way.  If there is a 33% chance that Bitcoin will tossed into the crapper, a 33% chance that it will stay about the same, or a 33% chance that it will go to $10K+ each, what would you do?
Is investing everything you own right now with a 30% chance of losing everything and end up on the street worth it?  The payout odds says you should invest everything... that's the logical thing to think.
The wise thing to think is to consider surviveability.  If bitcoin takes off, it does not take much to make a nice little nest egg to take care of your kids college or to retire comfortably.  If bitcoin goes to $10k, it only takes about $2k to net you about $100k in future value.
My advise: invest so small an amount that if Bitcoin goes belly up, you will not miss the amount.  If you invest so much that you have to worry day in and day out about a major correction, then you've invested to much.  Just remember that it does not take much to take advantage of Bitcoin's potential, but if you get greedy, you'll regret the sleepless nights and the panic sells when there are major corrections.

"money laundering" is a made up crime.  To jail those handling money outside of the normal banking system accountable for the crimes committed by those obtaining illicit funds is immoral and unethical.  If I give you $10k that I obtained via a real crime, you should not be held responsible unless you can reasonably know that the $10k was part of a crime.  To assume you've committed a crime or to make up a new crime for not "registering" (e.g. asking for permission) for something as fundamental as handling money or goods is akin to punishing innocent people for the crimes of the guilty.
As the libertarians would say... Look for the "gun in the room".  Why do we have to ask the guy with a gun for permission (some government regulator) to exchange money?  If we have to ask, are we slaves or are we free?

Either existing money transmitting businesses will spring up to compete, or the profit motive will step in to change existing laws.  All that is needed is a potential difference between the exchange values, and the best way to do that is to avoid direct fiat bitcoin exchanges and let the sharks have a feeding frenzy over the potential difference.

Fractional reserve is about expanding the money supply and earning interest on money that does not exists.  E.G.  I lend you $100, but I only have $10... but you keep an account in my system (bank or ripple)... then I charge you interest on $100.  As long as on average people don't withdraw the funds, you can get away with the fraud.
This is how the banking system works, and the Fed is there to back up the bankers in case there's a run on the banks... and the Fed simply gives them more money to cover their reserves.

Ever think about how things become "illegal"?  They only become that when the legislative power thinks it has enough justification or enforcement power to con everyone into accepting new laws.  Every time there is not enough justification, it has to dip into its enforcement power.  Its a balancing act.  With everyone becoming aware of all the existing unjust laws, and attempts by legislative bodies to enact further unjust laws, the justification power is just about gone.  Any new laws outlawing Bitcoin will be leans against the enforcement power.

The bitcoin forum poster is spinning the argument.  He lists the 81 BTC but fails to mention that the BTC on 7-30-12 were only worth around $500 tops.  While the poster may have a valid complaint, he is being far from balanced and is attempting to smear Coinabul.  Read Coinabul's response to get a different perspective.  If there were multiple complaints against Coinabul, and the poster was being balanced and factual, then we should give more credence to the squabble.  Based on how the poster is taking this to both bitcointalk.org and now I suspect that the poster may have his order and is simply trying to extort BTC from the Coinabul.  Even if Coinabul sends the original order again, the same thing may happen all over, and the poster could say that he never receive the order.
This really should be taken elsewhere, as it is not about and it detracts from real discussions.

If the government recognizes Bitcoin and virtual currencies and wishes to regulate them, then virtual currencies are no longer subject to capital gains because they are not commodities, but recognized currencies.

From a prior post of mine:
I was suggesting a few days ago that there be a guaranteed fee based on an algorithm.  Those transactions paying this fee would be assured their transactions reached the block chain.  The algorithm would attempt to accomplish the following:
* Charge higher fees for larger transactions.
* Charge a lower % on larger transactions.
* Charge lower fees for smaller transactions.
* Charge a higher % on smaller transactions.
* Account for increased value of bitcoins.
(Some of these sound contradictory, but when you see the examples, you will understand.)
The basic idea is two calculated fees added together to accomplish the above objectives.  One calculation is based on the average number of bitcoins per transaction (ABT) in the last 1000 blocks (or whatever number of blocks it takes to change the difficulty).  The other calculation is the based on the current number of bitcoins to be sent (BTS).  The result of the two would be added together to get the transaction fee, which would accomplish the above objectives.  The multiplier (MT) can be small so that it would still be very reasonable to send bitcoins. Here's an example:
* ABT:  2 BTC     (About $100)
* BTS:  .02 BTC  (About $1)
* MT: .0005  ( .05% or half a tenth of a percent)
* FEE:  2*.0005 + .02 * .0005 = 0.00101 BTC ( About $.05 )
5 cents to send $1 is a fairly good deal, considering that MasterCard and Visa probably charge merchants around $.5 to do the same thing.  Note that the percentage of the transaction is around 5%, so it would discourage people from spamming lots of $1 transactions.  Here's another example:
* ABT:  2 BTC     (About $100)
* BTS:  2 BTC  (About $100)
* MT: .0005  ( .05% or half a tenth of a percent)
* FEE:  2*.0005 + 2 * .0005 = 0.002 BTC ( About 10 cents )
Again, 10 cents is a good deal given that MasterCard and Visa probably charge $2 to $5 (2 to 5%) for the same transaction.  Also, most people would not think twice about this amount.  Also, the percentage of the transaction is .1%.  This is a smaller percentage than the first example, but is double the amount.  For the final example, let's look at a much larger transaction.
* ABT:  2 BTC     (About $100)
* BTS:  200 BTC  (About $10,000)
* MT: .0005  ( .05% or half a tenth of a percent)
* FEE:  2*.0005 + 200 * .0005 = 0.10001 BTC ( About $5)
Again, $5 is a good deal given that MasterCard and Visa probably charge $100 to $200 (1 to 2%) for the same transaction.  Again, most people would see $5 to make a $10k transaction as reasonable.  Note again, that the percentage is low, but the amount is higher for the larger transaction.
So what if you want to send 10,000 BTC ( $500k )and you don't want to pay the 5 BTC ($250) to shuffle the transactions around?  Well, you can still pay .1 BTC ( $5 ), and most miners would still accept the transaction because it is much more than the average transaction fee.  Also, note that as bitcoin continues to take off, the average number of bitcoins per transaction will decrease because the smaller amounts are now worth more.  This will lower the transaction fees for the first calculation in proportion to the value of bitcoin.
EDIT: Minor edit to correct "larger" to "smaller".  Also, in the last paragraph I mentioned that someone sending $500k of BTC could ignore the rules and still get the transaction through.  An alternative would be to change the guarantee rules to cap the calculation to 100x (or some reasonable multiple) the average transaction size.  A cap of 100x the average transaction size would put the cap for the above examples at $5.  A $500k transaction would cost the same as a $10k transaction, and would be guaranteed just the same.

1. His "money" looked somewhat similar to U.S. currency, but anyone with a brain would see it was not standard U.S. currency.
2. Even though he was attempting to make his own currency and it looks like 486 is applicable, you have to remember that this is under title 18, which deals with counterfeiting and fraud.  Neither of which are applicable to what this guy was doing.
As best as I can discern, this guy was railroaded.

While everyone is looking at the RND function, people should also start looking at the possibility of code injection at the IC level as well.  Not only should we consider this inside the CPU, but any other attached devices that can access memory outside the CPU's control.  With world government's attempting to control their populations, I would not be surprised to find that pressure will be continually applied to any centralized points to spy on their citizens.

Supply is finite, just as the earth is.  But the argument that it will all be extracted and horded is false.  There will always be some in the ground, and because gold and silver are distributed fairly evenly around the world, there is no way to control it all.  Thus mining will take place if deflation becomes to prevalent.


Granted.  But this lends itself to hoarding and value manipulation, whereas gold and silver can be mined in increasing volume if those metals are hoarded to much.

What happens if you don't pay someone or you pay someone late?  The trust goes down, and people will refuse to lend you more money in the future.  While some ripple systems have a "rating" system, it's not really needed.  Over time, the system would correct itself by weeding out the untrustworthy and strengthening the network of the trustworthy.  Besides, the idea is that you only extend credit (trust) to those who you know.
If you are popular enough, people will give you money and you can record that "credit" in your system without reciprocating that trust.  For example, I may know you and your reputation, but you have no idea who I am, but you will take my money and record that you owe me money.  From there I spend this "credit" through the ripple system, until you owe me nothing.

Let's clear some of this up.
* "ripplin" is a scam that takes the term "ripple" in an attempt to make a MLM system (a sort of legal ponzi scheme).
* "ripplin" is not "ripple".
* ripple.com is a site created by OpenCoin with a currently proprietary front end, but open source back end.
* The ripple.com back end is distributed to take care of the accounting aspects of ripple.
* Anyone can start a new "ripple" website with the distributed back end to take advantage of the ripple network.
* XRP is a "manipulated" postage stamp system where OpenCoin has a large stake in its value.  This is how OpenCoin will make money, by selling XRP.
* XRP's value is only in its ability to postage stamp each transaction.  Each transaction destroy's a very small XRP.  At the current rate, each XRP and process thousands of transactions, and there are currently well over 90 billion XRP in existence.
* XRP's are used to keep people from spamming the ripple distributed back end system.  It is used to associate a cost to making frivolous transactions.
So, with all that said, **if people still don't trust the ripple.com system, run with the open source back end and re-create the same system, but substitute the XRP with some other sort of anti-spamming mechanism.**

In theory, if the CO and the PTS service work together, then yes, you can double spend.  However, assuming that PTS does not cheat, then you know that CO cannot cheat because the network will not allow an immediate spend of the CO coins without the PTS signature.  That's the whole idea.
Think of the "partially trusted double signature" as like a "limited double signature" (LDS).  In a LDS, both parties have to sign the transaction before the network will accept the transaction and record it.  In my scenario, the same applies, but only for a limited time.  After a day or two, the network will allow the CO to spend the coins normally without the second signature.  (See my last edit to the original post because my thought changed a little in how to implement.)

Computer security is the Achilles heal of Bitcoin.  It will be the one thing limiting widespread adoption.  Software companies and hardware vendors have been so driven to develop quickly and cheaply, those who engineer and design hardware and software often put security at the bottom of the list.  Those complaining about security are often ignored or fired in favor of those who "get it done" without regard for security.
On the bright side of things, if Bitcoin gets enough market capitalization, there will be sufficient demand to justify creation of secure hardware and software.

Sounds good, but depending on one individual to keep track of off chain transactions is risky.  A better bet would be to create an off chain system that is run by a group of people.  In order to get the coins back into the main chain, a plurality of signatures would be needed... say 5 of 10 signatures to move back.  That way in order to have a loss of coins, you would have to have 6 or more people defect and refuse to sign, or 5 or more decide to steel coins.
The group could also simply run an alt chain where they sign transactions into their alt chain in rotation every minute (where anything over 2 minute can be rotated to the next person on the list).  The algorithm to add to the alt chain could vary from group to group.

If you present someone with reasonable evidence that it's not a scam and they still insist that it is, then you can only conclude one of four things:
1. He's right and you simply don't have the overall perspective or experience to come to his conclusion.
2. His requirements for proof are two high.
3. He's a shill attempting to wear you down or waste time.
4. He's mentally unable to let go of ideas.
I would ask honest questions (not condescending or leading) to understand why he thinks it's a scam.  Gathering information and viewpoints are valuable when dealing with the issue in the future.  After that, simply just agree to disagree, as attempting to manipulate someone into accepting your view only kills all lines of communication and hardens the idea that it's a scam.

There is an advantage if you have a large order.  For example, if you put an order for 10k BTC, then everyone will see this order and buy BTC ahead of you because they see their downside risk has been reduced.  In essence you are giving them a low cost put option because they see your wall.  Further, you are less likely to get your order.  ("I see that wall at $100 and I'll place and order for $100.05 and wait for an uptick to sell.  Worst case is that it will fall back to $100, and I'll sell into that wall.")  NOTE: With trading bots, you can be sure that this will happen.
On the other hand, if you place a dark order, the traders don't see your wall and cannot take advantage of your order.  Traders will not know that you are going to hold the price at $100 for 10k BTC, so they are less likely to step in and use your wall against you.
Basically, dark orders are useful big traders who don't want to show their hand for fear of pushing the price up or down (against their trade) with their large limit orders.  Orders that are dwarfed by the minute by minute volume don't have to worry about this type of manipulation, as the trade volume can easily overtake such small limit orders.
