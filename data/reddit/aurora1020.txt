Ok. I get that. Let's go for a drink then.

It's not the same. There many more empty addresses than addresses containing bitcoin. You can stop drinking now.

No need to be sorry. I'm not a statistician or anything but it seems to be very simplified way of thinking about probability of something happening. You might as well say you have the same chance of picking winning lottery numbers versus picking loosing. I suggest you buy some tickets ASAP, after all you have 50/50 chance of winning. Not really.

You wont get it back from hackers. Your only hope is to get it back from Uphold but I dont know how likely it is. You would have to prove its their fault, sue them and all that stuff. Sorry for your loss.

It probably can. I don't own one so my knowlegde ends here - but the point stands - coins are information available to everyone. You are owner of coins if you have private key to address with balance.

Yes. Research cold storage. I split my holdings into max of 0.05BTC per address but thats just my preference and I have small amount so thats not a problem.

You are not missing anything.
Well maybe that it's completely self destructive action to take because trust and therefore value of bitcoin would plummet. So its not viable way of gaining money, more like viable way of udermining bitcoin as a whole.

Ok, that's fine. I was just pointing out that paper is not the same as gold and this difference has real life implications. I too don't need gold. We'll start mining asteroids in couple of decades anyways so gold will lose it's value dramatically.

Why would you need trezor then? And you don't move coins to trezor. Coins are information that on certain address there is certain balance. This info is public. As was said before trezor stores your private key to address with bitcoins. You may as well store this key on a piece of paper.

Yes, but you cant print more gold, inflate it's value and pretty much steal someones money by doing so.
