Shit, Bitcoin in *Tasmania?* It's rare to see my home state mentioned on any part of reddit.

Yeah, that's exactly right. Censorship achieves nothing if you even insinuate the word.

I bought 6 fresh donuts for 5 dollars today.

Why are you using an exclamation mark instead of an i?

Thanks for the BJ, Obama!

Just regular sugary ones from Wendy's.

I don't really see the point in changing *one* character to another that looks almost the same. It's not even slightly changing how readable the word is.

I think I have found the culprit: 
The VDDC temperatures are far too high, despite having aftermarket cooling...
@_date: 2013-05-04 15:07:22
Ah, so you swap them around. Right.

Thanks, just posted in there.

If I recall correctly, the stock launcher does the same thing. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 10:57:19
It's just the stock launcher. Nothing to do with Cyanogenmod.

Only 32 votes?

I use BTC Guild. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 06:12:11
But why settle with 600, when I can potentially be getting 800?

So how would you denote a decimal?
