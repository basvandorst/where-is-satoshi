Neither did cell phones.  But we figured it out... why not PoS?

Proof of Stake, anyone?

Did you try and send the person who gifted you this wallet your seed words?

Not a find - he saw a clever post on Twitter and claimed it for himself...

Very good!!!  
If I had to give some constructive criticism, I'd say to change the hands.  Particularly the crest of the meat of the thumb.  Showing the crest implies the hand is facing palm-upward.  Cut that crest with a new, straighter line from wrist to index finger, showing the cut of the glove.  
Otherwise, perfect!

Well I guess we know what you were spending all your gains on... 
@_date: 2018-12-22 07:11:35
Are we going to repost this every time we gain 10%? 15%?  20%?
 
Or just when someone feels like whoring BTC out for karma.

And so it begins.  CONGRATULATIONS

Binance has already told you that your account is under investigation due to suspected fraudulent activity.  Reps from Binance also told you that posting here on Reddit will have absolutely zero affect on the speed or the result of this investigation. 
If you truly haven't done anything wrong, I would suggest you get an attorney.  In any case, posting here doesn't seem like it will help you to any measurable degree.
