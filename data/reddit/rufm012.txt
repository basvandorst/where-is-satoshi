I had an idea for that  
Everyone has to solve a captcha in a 10sec or so timeframe to validate their account, everyone at the same time  
And so there can't be more than one account per person  
  
They can pay someone to type the captcha, but that someone can't validate an account of his own, and so it's still something

Of course it is unpractical, but do you have another, even unpractical, idea? If you want to put an upper bound on accounts, with one person per account, purely anonymously, it is a way, and maybe the only way.

Let's say I want to store money for 5 years.  
I can put it in a bank as fiat, and in 5 years I'll have roughly my money.  
Or I can buy Bitcoin, and have -unknown- value in 5 years.  
  
So, where am I going to store my money?  
  
Also, I don't believe stability comes from the market cap, it comes from balance mechanisms (the central bank). There won't be a stable crypto until it's taking information from a free market to balance itself, through supply. "Austrian economics" are wrong, dixit the Nobel prize. For some reason, some people here seem to know better, but the public isn't fooled. Instead of convincing people that Bitcoin is perfect as it is, you should convince them that Bitcoin can evolve... But you can't. This information is unknown. And so, tough luck.
