but how is the sec going to stop jihan from relentlessly wash trading bch, dash, and others on bithumb? community activism perhaps should have exposed this, but it's not working: people are too greedy and just want to chase momentum.

it actually looks like brian was one of the chief instigators, not merely complicit. and the real crime wasn't the insider trading, it's the WASH trading. the $9.5k gdax price was clearly a wash trade gone very very wrong. and it seems coinbase did not preannounce bch trading in advance, b/c they wanted maximum shock effect for their wash trade.  and they also did NOT want their customers to be aware and be able to dump at the open, making the wash trade more difficult to work. 
ps, gdax was wash trading ltc last week, and btc the week before that.  wonder if the gov't cares about any of this... consumers who still want to buy, or who bought the tops, are being raped.

ok maybe i'll educate you about decentralization. i don't particularly care whether the gov't intervenes here or not, i am confident bch will be a dud anyways. but what i want is bch to die as fast as possible, so we can focus back on the task that really matters: raising btc's block cap. but in the end if btc can't do it, then one of the other altcoins will win; that's how decentralization works in cryptoland.

it may be illegal for the little people, but big players manipulating gold oil ES and vix on the CME is actively encouraged by the so called "regulators". in this case, my guess is the cftc will not be happy with coinbase's bull$hit. not sure brian fully understands who he is messing with.

bch is not really proof of work. bch's hashpower ratio relative to btc has always been far below the price ratio (even accounting for fee differences), causing bch's block height lead to be dropping like a rock. unless bch overtakes btc, and soon, they will probably need to do merged mining, which is also not really proof of work.

actually that's a really good point, this was clearly a wash trade gone wrong. i think it's the same groups of people wash trading btc, ltc, bch up on gdax, and btc, dash, bch on bithumb, for example. bch is just the worst offender. maybe there will be hell to pay, and the regulators will bring the hammer down.

yep, you and me are not getting fcked directly by this scam, but plenty of newbs are, and that's destroying the credibility of crypto. these bullshit pumps are repulsive, but how do we stop them? one possibility is gov't intervention, and another is community activism. does community activism, demanding the exchanges tell us who is trading massive volumes on the pump, have any chance of working? or do we have to wait for all the newbs to lose their money on gdax and bithumb, and then let the more legitimate exchanges like gemini or others take over? letting the bullshit exchanges go bust was the mt gox route, and that did severe damage to the whole ecosystem for years.

this is indeed the only ironclad, incontrovertible rule of bitcoin. it is the longest chain, PERIOD. no ifs ands or buts, NONE.

and this statement is so important that it takes precedent over any other statements satoshi ever made in his emails, forum posts, or the whitepaper.
