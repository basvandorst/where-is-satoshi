What will happen when all the debt is removed from the system? Consumption based economic system is reliant on debt, and if you remove the debt the amount of money in circulation falls and most people will become poor. Any arguments against this? I'm not big fan of the huge consumption/waste but it offers everyone better livelihood.

No comments on this? Nobody is worried about the development?
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:07:06
So in the end you would suggest to build the whole ecosystem with C++? That's a good point about mass adoption!
@_date: 2018-08-26 14:37:20
Thanks for the answer! Have to take a look, not so familiar with C# in general. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:08:26
Actually what do you say about C++? Some other argued it would be the best for the whole system dev? Could it be better than C
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:55:21
If you can choose to learn either one? Both are equally good for all use cases?

Actually monetary inflation is worse for the elite because current 2% hits them harder than average worker. Wealthy person pays 2million from 100m wealth while average person pays 600 from 30k salary.    Of course its harder to start a business with 600 less but I don't think that would be the main reason.

Not sure why the sigh...  Of course saving is tough job, but the question is about inflation of money, not assets or bitcoin (because it is deflationary). You can save your money on the stock market index or bitcoin where the value keeps increasing, and after a while you cant start your own business.

What's your opinion on Java or c++ for blockchain?
@_date: 2018-08-26 06:45:44
Right, how about this: Which one JS or Python, would have more benefits of communicating with server side or mobile platforms? Or E-Commerce platforms?
@_date: 2018-08-26 06:41:21
Thanks, this is an useful answer! 
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:10:56
unfortunately some people do...  the question is more about other things than necessities, the extra money that you have left over after the monthly expenditure, would you save it as money if its deflationary, or would it be better that inflation encourages you to put it in stock or your venture where it produces more? 
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:45:35
Haha, you are so smart. But come on, share your thoughts! 
@_date: 2018-08-26 06:46:19
Dogecoin! 
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:11:58
Haha that guy is just a moron. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:32:25
Hehe sorry, so am I. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:14:03
Well said!
@_date: 2018-08-26 06:40:02
Well, perhaps you should read the topic of the thread. Python vs Javascript for Blockchain? 
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:32:19
All these assets you mentioned are denominated in the local currency. If you purchase bonds or land you purchase them with dollars. And the dollar value goes down by the "estimated" 2%. What is different with these investments that their value goes up, if land price goes up by 5% then the real gain is 3%. 
You are right that its hard to buy land with 30k, but I think your problem is not with inflation but wealth concentration. 
Would you have problem with bitcoin if in 20 years some of the early investors hold 50% of the market cap, they could buy everything they want while the average person who has invested only a bit of their money in bitcoin, is still not able to invest in their own business? 
@_date: 2018-08-26 14:35:17
Okay, why would it be better than the others? Compared to Bitcoins C++, what are the benefits? 
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:15:35
How about java or c++?
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:46:41
Very typical indeed. Which one would you go for?
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:14:55
I would say also some land sale registries and supply chain applications. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:13:52
Assets grow in prices in general but not money, except bitcoin. Inflation depreciates your money, but not your house, because house prices are based on real demand. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:07:37
well said, but probably not too much inflation. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:06:43
If you consider other things than houses, you wouldn't use the money on anything because by holding it, it would be more valuable every year? Then you would be investing in the money and not spending or investing it in other ventures.
For the second part, you should check marginal demand curve, price goes down when quantity increases, in other words your utility for the first chocolate bar is much higher than the 5th bar, because you had enough.

Well said! 
@_date: 2018-08-26 14:38:42
Which currency doesn't have it except bitcoin? All major fiat ones are basically the same and they work, to some extent. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 14:30:35
Your answer is awesome! Finally answering the actual question. Thank you very much! 
If you would need to choose one of all the languages available, which one would you choose? (C/C++/Java/Node.js/Python/C# or some other one?) 
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:53:18
The question is not really about myself, but about general programming. In this case a person has equal experience with both. 
Which one JS or Python, would have more benefits of communicating with server side or mobile platforms? Or E-Commerce platforms? 
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:35:44
Haha, do you think those assets operate in vacuum? Please google it, all assets are affected by local currency. 
On the second point you are kind of right, especially a few hundred years ago most rulers increased money supply to fund their wars and fun, without any oversight. Nowadays its bit better as central banks are bit more transparent, but nowhere near as transparent as bitcoin. 
But don't you think that 21m coins are too few for 7b people?
@_date: 2018-08-16 05:06:39
Have you checked what happens when inflation is 0? There is no growth either. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:10:53
Yes java, someone else argued for c++.
