Looks about right.

Guess they'll just have to EFT the other person to transfer bitcoin to them on a paper wallet which they can easily use an internet connection or trade in the neighboring South Africa.

Not really... If you do, you will most likely be called racist or alternatively be accused of creating inequality and therefore you must pay for the damage...

What kind of special...? The kind of special that not only think about pollution at the end point. Please do the world a favour and read up how much pollution is generated by the mining operations for materials required with the batteries for the storage, the toxic waste created with the production of solar panels. Lastly the kind of special which knows the panels are not biodegradable and there is no recycling plans or policies for solar panels at it's end of life in about 20 years.
So yes... I'm a real kind of specials because people are narrow minded and don't take the whole picture into context.

Think it's subjective... I believe nuclear power is the future. With safe technologies like molten salt reactors we can have safe abundant energy.
This is not talking about nuclear fusion which is still in development which will be the future and truly enable space travel. 
Batteries is not going to do that. It will aid in it I'm sure, but believe nuclear power is more important than solar and other "green" energy tech like burning trees aka biomass energy.

Yay... More toxic waste and pollution for the world...

Who ever said free? People have a misguided view that renewables are "free". Nothing is free. Solar and wind is not free.  If you think it's free, good luck with that.
Energy companies are getting tax payer funded subsidies from governments for using "renewables" like burning wood. In the UK one of the biggest coal power plants have been converted to run on "biomass" aka renewable energy.
They use the money to buy wood from California.

Wonder how long it will take people to realise that renewable energy include burning biomass aka wood, which is less efficient than coal.

That's not how it works, you made the accusation you need to provide proof. Innocent until proven guilty.
Not too bright are we?

Still doesn't prove anything. Bet you believe cholesterol causes heart attacks/cardiovascular disease. 
You keep yelling that about for another 5 years, you are confusing Trump with Hillary Clinton.
I won't delete jack sh1t, snowflake admins do that  maybe.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:08:53
Have any proof of that?
@_date: 2019-12-26 18:11:51
Thought so.

For me using bots for trading between crypto's I seem to make a good amount of growth over time only to drop about to end up 5% below from where it started from before the growth.
I think it's safer just buying bitcoin, the value in USD might drop, but it's not a double drop like with trading with other coins.

Got to love the fact that it's not regulated.

This is such a bad example, because the 300 lost in the end... So did the 10000 Spartans who followed them...

No it's not.

Aren't you confusing ICO's with Bitcoin? I know there was a ban on ICO's by the Chinese government... Chinese law sees bitcoin as private property so Chinese people are allowed to own it, it's just not allowed to used as a medium for exchange within business, but private individuals is allowed to own it and transact with it privately.

I'll quickly give them an address I don't use to regulate...
