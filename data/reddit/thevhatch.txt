Sorry but Bitcoin is Myspace

So... What is "the end" exactly?
@_date: 2019-07-15 05:37:30
I've had a transaction stuck for three days before.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:57:34
Maybe last month $1 could work.  I sent a large(for me) $7 single input segwit transaction a couple days ago and I'm fully expecting it to never confirm.  Kinda upset here... 
Also pretty big fail to not have sending to gdax before spending on the chart.  Coinbase sent me $69 last night and happily paid the $31 transaction fee.  Not sure why the do that still but thanks... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:48:34
They can't release it because then everyone would see how it doesn't work or just increases centralization. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:00:51
Well said mate.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:30:59
Why was Segwit opt-in again? 
@_date: 2018-09-12 00:53:31
It might have something to do with the OP using a waste bin icon to represent the 'others' category...

You arent a "store of value" proponent? Me neither.  Imo Bitcoin is in the very beginning of its death throws.  It was a good idea and made some people very rich but it was flawed.  I wish I'd sold the rest of mine last week when I knew better.  A currency just can't work with these fees and store of value is bs rhetoric.  
It's time for the next generation of cryptocurrency to take over. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:53:02
Everyone has more than 31 Satoshi pretty much lost in a wallet because the fees cost more than the value of the wallet.  So, no, this can't ever happen with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:05:22
Your analogy fails because products get over-produced and liquidated every day of the year.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:53:15
That's Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Miner's problem, not the market's. 
Realistically, just because something costs a certain amount to make does not mean there will be people willing to pay that price.
@_date: 2018-10-10 03:38:06
So hard to read... 
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:29:08
And yet if feels like the most stable BTC has ever been... 
@_date: 2018-06-20 02:11:42
The article seemed like pointless rambling to me.  But to your point, does $650 billion in electricity solely to do Bitcoin math really seem like a good use of the planet's resources to you?
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:11:39
No such thing as risk free interest.

OK HODLer
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:20:29
/s right? 
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:42:30
@_date: 2019-09-30 03:21:11
Universally?  Thanks, I'll have to look into that.
@_date: 2019-09-02 06:00:39
Because nearly 18 million of the possible 21 million bitcoins already exist. 
This halvening should mean essentially nothing unless there is big market manipulation; by a tether infusion for example.  Miners are gonna have a bad time if the price doesn't move though.
@_date: 2019-09-30 06:10:41
No but the vendor pays the same fee regardless of which Visa card I use.
@_date: 2019-09-30 04:28:39
I see your point that the merchant credit card fee is built into the price of goods. So the merchant is paying the cc company 3% and they are giving me 2% of it back. 
Of course I realize that I'm not making money because I'm spending it.
@_date: 2019-09-30 03:28:06
2% cash back rewards on all purchases.  It's not uncommon. Other cards can even easily get you 5% on specific categories or stores.
@_date: 2019-09-20 16:47:15
Maybe. Maybe not.

Lighting is already dying.
@_date: 2018-07-11 06:31:34
If btc goes to 3k and it costs 5k to mine, is the fee market still unimportant? 
@_date: 2019-09-13 10:29:30
Is it actually though?
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:12:59
When I spend $80 with my Visa they pay me $1.60, I get additional consumer protections and its a simpler process. Just sayin... I know crypto still has applications though.
@_date: 2019-09-30 05:54:13
Bitcoin has been interesting these last couple weeks too.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:35:16
It actually can't with current framework.  Fees would hit $50.
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:37:09
I take it you have not actually made many btc transactions.
@_date: 2019-09-30 05:52:19
The vendor doesn't know what kind of rewards card I have.
