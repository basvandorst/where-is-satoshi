To make up for the varying price of btc
@_date: 2017-02-28 09:41:10
@_date: 2017-02-03 16:12:18
You wait for it to drop or you buy now and hope it keeps rising
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:05:13
If you have money in your account then it sold. Pretty sure it just show btc amount in Coinbase if you don't have fiat
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:33:55
LBC or paxful 
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:37:32
He's probably not doing it for a profit. Just a fun project.
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:47:30
Gemini .25%
Cex.io 7%
Bread 1% + $.5

Gemini works for me. Only a .25% fee and they do instant funding for bank accounts. No credit/debit tho
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:48:11
I keep a log of my transactions. Buying/selling. Then just average out the price I paid pet BTC. I think it would be too much work to know which BTC costs what.
@_date: 2017-02-18 08:38:46
Will there be integration of Gemini?
@_date: 2017-02-17 08:54:37

The first website is blockchian
@_date: 2017-02-02 08:08:16
Most exchanges are always different in price since there are different users buying/selling controlling the price on that exchange. Just remember if it's too good to be true, it usually is.
@_date: 2017-02-20 07:54:06
Yeah happens to me. I usually just wait since I'm not in a hurry to cash out
@_date: 2017-02-11 18:28:21
I've bought BTC with 3 different banks and none even batted an eye
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:08:02
Coinbase or Gemini. If you go with coinbase, use their exchange GDAX since the fees are a TON lower
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:35:17
Depends on how you sold it. Limit? Market? Gotta be more specific
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:36:26
Are you asking someone to sell you BTC?
@_date: 2017-02-25 11:29:50
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:24:35
Are you asking how people keep track of their bitcoin records?
@_date: 2017-02-28 08:33:25
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:42:14
If you are using coinbase. USE GDax. It will save you money. Not much, but it will. Gdax is coinbase's exchange so the fees are a lot cheaper. Also if you do have money in Coinbase, you can just transfer it over to Gdax with no cost. Coinbase fee (1.49%+.15) Gdax (.25%) 
@_date: 2017-02-09 03:51:16
KYC. If you don't want to jump through hoops, use localbitcoins or paxful
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:31:55
I enjoy day trading since it keeps me interested in BTC. If I just bought $2k worth of BTC and just let it sit in my wallet, I would probably be over it by now. The crashes/rises are what make it interesting for me
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:01:34
@_date: 2017-02-26 06:22:29
$2 in fees? I dont think so
@_date: 2017-02-26 11:01:20
Send coinbase a ticket. They will just have to verify your identity to take off the 2FA
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:48:23
I did your average and it's about $990 without exchange fees. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 08:05:20
Wait a couple days to see if your paypal account gets frozen because of fraud
@_date: 2017-02-26 06:24:58
BTW, It's not for fees. If I completely transfer out everything in my wallet, I still have around .002 that is just stuck in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:39:20
Why would you sell when it dips?
@_date: 2017-02-11 08:41:06
Gemini .25% fee
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:44:47
Don't listen to him/her. There is no right time to buy. Bitcoin is very unstable so it could possibly go up/down $200 tomorrow or stay stable for the next couple weeks. No one knows. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 02:03:35
I got a new ps4 bundle last week for $230. $130 off retail
@_date: 2017-02-09 01:21:43
Every website that allows paypal/venmo transactions tell you explicitly that they can be charged back  
@_date: 2017-02-26 06:23:27
$2 in fees?

Exactly. If you want to send 1BTC to a person you would actually have to send 1BTC+fee.
@_date: 2017-03-01 22:16:40
I use their mobile browser and it works perfectly.
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:18:44
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:23:49
Possibly. If you are sketched out, I would make a new account and do one day shipping so they send it out before the illegitimacy is noticed 
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:30:08
There is an escrow service so you usually will have to use the giftcard before sending bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:58:19
No. Unless you bought them specifically because they are illegitimate. You bought them because they are a good deal. No other reason. How would you know they were from an illegitimate source?
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:27:08
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:33:47
Coinbase isn't an exchange. I would use gdax or Gemini for better fees
@_date: 2017-02-02 04:42:07
Sounds like a steal!
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:33:54
180%. Started Late December
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:48:58
It is true for all vendors. Some are legally obtained and some aren't. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 02:53:19
Gemini Coinbase Localbitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:58:46
No such thing
@_date: 2017-01-25 04:03:19
Honestly no they shouldn't not all people are okay with how unstable bitcoin is at times.
@_date: 2017-01-30 05:21:35
Gemini is 0.25%
@_date: 2017-01-23 20:01:19
No you don't. I just used a check from my employer. Or there are ways of "making" a utilities bill
@_date: 2017-01-14 04:56:14
How much would you sell it for?
@_date: 2017-01-20 06:46:46
I would not trust paxful. If you want to do p2p use localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:08:08


Is the confirmation page the popup window?
@_date: 2017-01-30 05:22:34
If you're purchasing a big amount Trezor. If you are only holding a little, electrum is good
@_date: 2017-01-21 02:12:51
haha I wish. $.50 should've made that clear
@_date: 2017-01-31 09:36:18
You can would need to buy $130 worth of BTC(approx. 0.14BTC). You can buy it from coinbase but after you purchase it, you will want to send it to a different wallet before sending it to Scannable since his wallet might be blacklisted.
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:55:01
@_date: 2017-01-15 10:10:12
Darn I just need to be more careful next time.
@_date: 2017-01-29 19:15:20
Paxful is legit. But many users buy/sell using fraudulent methods
@_date: 2017-01-23 16:43:06
Gemini their exchange fee is 0.25% instead of 1.49%
@_date: 2017-01-30 02:53:33
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:54:34
Wire transfers always take a few days but the fees are lower. Credit/debit card are instant but the fees are much bigger. I use both coinbase and gemini. Gemini has a lot better fees (0.25%) instead of coinbase (1.49%). But you  can only wire at gemini.
@_date: 2017-01-21 00:32:56
I just tried it. Honestly not worth it. Especially if you want to be anon. They give you like 5 questions to start off with, with good pay (.50) then there are no more. And to cashout you need to link your LinkedIn page. 
edit: ($.50)
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:07:57
Thanks that helped. I have an issue though. It says that I have an unconfirmed transaction from May 22. Is there any way to get it out of limbo?
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:58:39
I've also tried resetting the cache and completing reinstalling JAXX

Lol how did you even find this post? This was from like 6 months ago
