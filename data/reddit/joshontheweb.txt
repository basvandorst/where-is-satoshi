where can you buy domains with bitcoin?

Maybe 5 or so. 4+ on physical items and about .3 tipping with changetip

People keep saying this.  I don't doubt it but it also doesn't make sense to me.  If you can modify the state of a photon and it is instantly manifest in the entangled twin, how is that not ftl?  What am I not understanding?

A more controversial approach would be to tweet to him saying that you pirated his show and changetip him $5 in the tweet as well.
edit: another approach would be to changetip him $5 and ask for permission to pirate it.

Wouldnt' that mean that you couldn't use entanglement for communication of any kind then?
I just read an article about how there are plans to make a satellite network that entangles photons and shoots them to separate routers on earth in order to use them for internet communication.  I guess I don't understand how that would be possible in this case.

A bad investment.  Most savings accounts interest rates don't keep up with inflation.

The more successful you are the less you have to care what people think.

What exactly did they do?
@_date: 2014-12-25 07:13:08
This isn't the exact article but a similar one 
Btw thanks for taking the time to field my questions.  Beer on me @_date: 2015-07-21 16:09:12
If anyone wants coinpeach.com I'll sell it for a reasonable price.  Beats the heck out of coinffeine.com

Yes, he eventually came around apparently.

Kind of funny.  I used to work for Jason Calacanis (founder of Launch Conference) when bitcoins were still worth about $7.  I told him I bought some and was thinking about mining.  He told me it was ridiculous and to find something 'real' to do with myself.  Now he's got bitcoin companies winning his conference.

Btcfun isn't very fun.

I do like the idea, but I think it is more practical to do this over time.  Maybe ask this at every place you eat out.  You don't have to leave to make your point.  You could if you have time but who has time for that. Let every vendor, restaurant, market, that you go to know that you would like to pay with bitcoin.  The message will get across.

Thats what I'm doing right now but the server keeps crashing and I'm through dealing with all my nieces and nephews asking me to reboot it.  It's awesome to pop in and see what they create though.  I'd rather just pay someone else to keep it running.  I'm using McMyAdmin2 and its flakey.

I'm not being negative.  It's a fine idea but it would be more effective if you did this everywhere you went, not just on one day.
