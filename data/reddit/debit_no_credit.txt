I'm no expert and I haven't used these services myself, but here's what I've gathered.
First, set up your Bitcoin client. This is covered in the 'Getting Started' link in the sidebar. At the bottom of the 'Getting Started' page, there is a link to the 'Buying Bitcoins' page. The 'Buying Bitcoins' page lists major exchanges. Choose one that takes GBP.
Here's how the process goes: You make your Bitcoin wallet. You make an account on an exchange. You put GBP in the account at the exchange. (from a bank I presume) You buy bitcoins with the GBP on the exchange. You send the bitcoins to your bitcoin wallet.

Needs moar people! Seriously, I feel like it's winding down and you can already see who won. More promotion would at least make things more interesting.
I'M NOT AFFILIATED!! Just participated.

Can I expand on your idea a little? Just brainstorming.
What about a bitcoin money transfer service over snail mail?
So you send coins to the service. The service prints out a paper wallet, sends the coins to it and then mails the paper wallet to a recepient. The service costs a nominal fee (preferably flat).
Questions I have are: Would such a service ever be useful? and Would such a service be profitable? Can such a service be securely created and operated?

Interesting. Just to say, I hope I'm not coming off as an ass. I'm just not in favor of giving out handouts. Somebody has to pay for that.

Oh I agree. If you see any out there, herd em this way.
I don't feel bad because because they were told what they were getting into.

... How is it *unfair* that they block bitcoin apps? It's Apple's store. They can do whatever they want.

No offense to the OP, but I think 'Bitcoin is at $ xx' posts should either be self posts or not allowed.
They should be self posts because, even though it's helpful and prompts a decent discussion, it takes no effort to take a screenshot of Gox.
They should be banned because it's not hard to just go to Gox and see the price yourself. Are we going to do this every at every dollar? It's one thing if the price jumped 40%. That's news. It's another thing when it's only up 3%. 
I won't even lie. I'm bitching about something insignificant. Didn't get my coffee this morning.

Anyone use 2-factor at MtGox? It accepts my login creds, but nothing happens when I put in my 2 factor auth code.

Can you explain this please?

I really like this idea. I'd love to help make this happen, but my technical skills are weak. However, I could try to help coordinate this, if anyone is willing to contribute.
What we need:
- A list containing methods of buying Bitcoins. Each item should have the following attributes: (based on *sgornick*'s comment)
 - A small blurb about how the method works
 - Location of buyer
 - Speed of transaction (estimated or relative)
 - Cost of transaction (close to market value or more expensive)
 - Amount that can be purchased (Any, 100 BTC, 0 - 10 BTC)
 - Privacy level
 - Technical experience (novice, intermediate, expert)
- Someone to code a webpage that essentially functions as a wizard. The wizard should take any number of the inputs mentioned above and display all methods that meet the criterea. It can be as simple as using a single page with drop down menus or a super slick multi-page web 2.0 kind of thing. To show what I had in mind, see [Example 1]( [Example 2]( [Example 3](
- Webspace
- A place to collaborate (Google Docs?)
Any takers?

Why yes... yes it is.
Otherwise, I have to spend *my* money, *my* time and *my* resources to take care them with no return. Then they go off and have kids so that *my* kids have to spend *their* money, time and resources to take care of *these other peoples'* kids. It's a cycle of destruction. They never learn and always consume. That's why you can't give money to homeless people.
Extinction happens.

All you people who don't have the 1 BTC minimum should message me.
I'll combine your funds and put it in. Everyone will get returns proportional to what they put in. I have to take 10% off the top.
No this isn't a ponzi within a ponzi. This is me combining money and investing in a ponzi. I take 10%, then I give everyone their cut. I know that means you have to trust me with your money. I don't have many credentials, but let me say I have no intent of stealing your $5 investments. If there's something I can do to build some trust, let me know.
And act quickly! I'm not sure if you know how ponzis work, but the people who win are the people who get in first. The whole thing falls apart when it gets big.
