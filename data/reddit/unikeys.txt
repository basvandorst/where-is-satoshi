When sharing this post, we were aiming it at current crypto debit card providers, that rely on Visa and Mastercard networks. In January 2018, VISA decided to abruptly suspend the license of WaveCrest, a member of both the Visa and Mastercard networks which specialises in providing payment solutions. The event affected several crypto-fiat card providers and a global panic emerged from users who did not receive any warning and suddenly ended up holding deactivated and worthless cards with no way to spend their funds. Being directly exposed and dependent of such networks bring back centralisation on the map and weaken the independence of those projects.

Hello, the UKey card eliminates all concerns relating to privacy of biometric data since the fingerprints data never leave the card. Besides, the card also comes with a three factor authentication process, What I have (the UKey card), What I know (Optional Pin Code), What I am (Biometrics Data), which creates a strong chain of authentication for transaction. It is a highly secure way to store or spend your cryptocurrency.

guys seriously??? Buffet's investing knowledge came from Benjamin Graham, who was a vale investor. Buffet invests in huge companies like Coca Cola because he is betting on them to continue having success like they've been doing for the last 10 decades. He is essentially betting on sustained economic growth. OBVIOUSLY BITCOIN IS NOT SOMETHING HE WANTS TO INVEST IN.

i think payment channels like lightning network will completely solve the scalability problems bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are facing at the moment. The idea of making multiple transactions off the Blockchain completely solves the current congestion problems. Guys bitcoin can now become the world adopted payment system.
