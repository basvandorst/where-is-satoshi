There is much faster/cheaper way to send money to coinbase. Plus you don’t lose money on gbp&gt;eur. Just go to bitcoinUK and look for Revolut&gt;Coinbase. I mean do some research next time. Also if you sent in GBP its your fault not coinbase and will take couple weeks to sort it out. Its clearly said to send EUR otherwise u’re fked.

Im not surprised the price is going down if one prick and one exchange were able to make such a mess. I hope these shitcoin pricks are happy now.  It makes me doubt the whole cryptocurrency thing now tbh. I know everyone is going to say hodl etc but you know some people invest some serious money not 100$.
Also the argument invest what you can afford to lose is bad. Every loss hurts even the one you could afford. Bad times :/

Same here but I lost 3 LTC but shit happens and we learn not to panic on drops.

Thing is the price of btc was rather high for over a week so people invested a lot of money and if suddenly it drops that much because of this incident they lose confidence in it.

What fees ? If you go to GDAX no fees at all. Obviously they have to make a money as well as any other business. It took me 20 min of research and I found out about Gdax and didn’t pay any fees. So if someone can’t be bothered with using search bar then he deserves to pay those fees.

I just bought one off Amazon and it was all sealed and nice. I mean Amazon gets them from supplier right so if you’re capable of hacking those hardware wallets then you’re not working in Amazon’s warehouse. Also if you are such a hacker you would rather stay low key instead of risking your identity by getting hired at amazon  to steal them and brining back to the stock. It’s just my way of thinking about it but if you have large amount of currency and it bothers you at night to the level you can’t sleep then get one directly from the supplier to stop your paranoia.

Depends how much have you got to invest I guess. Look what happened today when bitcoin was going down so was every other alt so it’s not like other alts are safer. 
I would go for litecoins or ethers.
