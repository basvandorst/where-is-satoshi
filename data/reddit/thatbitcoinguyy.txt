Sounds good! you should also keep up with the Lightning network develepment. When it becomes easier to use you can set up your own lightning channel and this will make transacations with bitcoin instant and practically fee-less.  At the moment I believe it still requires tech knowledge to get it working, so just a little patience. I think it will be good for your business.

have you tried e-mailing Gemini contact support? sometimes you have to go out of your way to get noticed because of it's congestion. When i first got verified back in june even then it took a good 2 weeks and that's when they weren't really congested.

With Gemini I managed to buy BTC at 9.6k with no problems. When I deposit money into Gemini they give you credit for that amount so you can make purchases instantly instead of having to wait for your money transfer to get approved. But you won't be able to move the coins until it does get approved which doesn't matter anyway because you still got to make the purchase at the price you wanted. 
I thought gdax works the same way

isn't a simple solution to stop using tether? I never used it once before. You don't have to. If an exchange requires you to use tether than let's boycott them until they can prove their tether is backed up. 
We can get the entire crypto space to boycott Bitfinex.

check my post out, I can verify he's a scammer. He's been following me for many months now. I had no idea he was a scammer until one day i saw him make a post about "message me to help you guys earn free bitcoins" something in that context. I confronted him about how wrong it is to scam innocent people and my comments were deleted. I use IG to spread awareness and there's many scammers just like that guy. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:34:09
I agree, there should be a dedicated page to list scammers in organized sections from youtube scammers/ instagram / facebook / and twitter since I assume those are the main social media networks that scammers are taking advantage of. I just hope we all continue helping each other out. I feel like that's one thing bitcoin always was for and just another reason i find it to be revolutionary. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:18:04
MAJOR SCAMMER. He follows everybody who has any type of bitcoin as a tag ( He lies to newbies and tricks them claiming he can get them free bitcoins or something stupid like that. I've posted on some of his images but were deleted. 
I use IG to spread awareness about bitcoin and teach newbies and what I am seeing VERY often now is A LOT of scammers on social media. 
We need to alert all the new people to the game because social media will take a huge part in scamming. 
You should also post this on the sub r/cryptocurrency , they have been putting scammers on blast lately.

yeah Alexa from amazon does it totally fine
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:41:26
It's not irrelevant at all.There's less chance of something like Mt gox happening with an exchange like Gemini compared to a chinese exchange that isn't insured by anything.  Of course all goverments are corrupt but we still have to deal with them so let's be wise about what we choose. If you are blindlessly using random exchanges than I don't think crypto is for you. 
Obviously the only answer is decentralized exchanges but this needs a lot of work. 
I've been in cold storage since day 1. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:50:02
You should use Gemini. I also believe your money is backed up with gemini so if anything is lost they have to give it back to you one way or another. Coinbase is a greedy shithole company 
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:24:40
yeah I agree OP did not show any proof of him even being a scammer. I only know because I saw this guy doing his scams myself since he follows me. I never thought of putting it on reddit though. Perhaps we should blast all the scammers. The more scammers that are blasted the less attractive scamming in this field will be when they see their faces in popular forums exposing them lol
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:37:16
yes I also hold on my trezor. Gemini is possibly the safest exchange to buy from. As others have said they are FDIC insured, which makes them very legit and more safe to use. They will not risk messing with peoples money because of all the heavy goverment ties they have. I never needed to contact them so I'm not sure how responsive they are. I'm sure getting verified with them can take long like it does with most exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:55:12
can anyone TL;DR what this actually means?  
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:42:21
I'm not worried at all, I saw this coming weeks ago and I consider this normal. It's all the other coins who are going to get hit the hardest. Bitcoin already has social support so bitcoin will go back up regardless. Other coins will suffer longer.  And I know I'm right about Tai, he's a financial person. I've watched his videos and he's not that accurate about bitcoin or it's technology and I can't believe he told his fans to buy some shit coins who probably all lost money to his friends who pumped it.  Tai is great for business and shit like that but he just found out what crypto is so don't listen to him. He hasn't been here for the dips and attacks in the past.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:36:53
yes I would get a hardware wallet. Perhaps wait until the transactions start clearing up first. 
We were backed up by like over 220k so it's slowly clearing. But 
with the launch this sunday of futures and another launch on the 18th, I'm not sure if there will be any time for this to clear. Fees might be expensive for the rest of this month. Which doesn't bother me to be honest since we are all making a profit. 
But regardless I would still wait for it to clear more so fees can be cheaper for you to move the coins. But I wouldn't wait more than 4 weeks. maybe you can ask for a hardware wallet for christmas. Just make sure it's a trezor or ledger and preferrable ordered from it's official website.

The devs said it will come out in the first quarter of 2018, so just a couple months. It will take longer for the entire market to adapt as they have to still enable segwit first. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:20:09
many billionaires already are in the game. They're in the sidelines and don't talk about it. That being said, they will not sink bitcoin. They will just make it into a fun game for themselves making the price rise and drop from like 20k down to 16k and back up to 21k etc.. this will keep happening until we are over 100k and then the swings will be less dramatic when the price is more stable. 
Those exchanges are good to make bitcoin seem more legit to the public for large companies to accept it as a currency.

You can't just beg on here like that. That's honestly disrespectful to the users on here. The reason we donated and were supportive to Andreas was because of the dedication he has and puts in constantly for us which you can see for yourself through his work.

There you go, even more reason to avoid his shilled coin. I actually looked into it and it appears that he was trying to make a flip on 50 pounds of exposives (when you have 50 pounds of fireworks, that has exposive capablities) That just shows you how greedy this man is, he didn't care about any laws from the mail delivery service or the state he lived in, he was primarily focused on greed. Makes me wonder why he's trying so hard to pump his coin
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:08:47
It's not bad. It's what makes bitcoin stronger because it reminds everyone who the original chain is. Don't forget about all the bch coinbase still has, that shit will get dumped and pumped back into BTC.

For starters, donate to the lightning network project that's being built for bitcoin. 
Donate to the main devs of bitcoin to  give them that feeling that we care.
And I think andreas antonopoulos deserves at least 2 donatations. This guy eats and sleeps with bitcoin. He travels the world doing non stop conferences for bitcoin,I never saw anyone trying as hard for bitcoin as him and I think he deserves it a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:16:21
And I stated my points as well and you obviously refuse to look at the bright side of bitcoin. You didn't even have anything to say about the numerous projects being worked that will be released in 2018. What are you some shill ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:01:29
yeah 10k seems pretty accurate, 10-12k . Those are the big discount prices if it ever reaches that. Chances are it will go back before it gets to the 10k mark though. I know a lot of us would like that discount but probably won't happen.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:13:50
That's the exact reason I wouldn't sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:18:18
Technically we have 60/40 control over them. They all rely on the panic sellers to make their profit and their will always be panic sellers. But things won't get any better until bitcoin market cap hits a trillion+ I believe around than bitcoin will have enough real supporters who don't panic to keep it's strength. And I think at a trillion we will see bitcoin trending everywhere. Right now when bitcoin trends nobody really knows what it is. Until the actual facts of bitcoin are understood by the news and shit like than than we won't have peace anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:59:02
It's a volatile place to be, making it risky. It's the safest place to technically be since you are your own bank.  It can replace any currency. But it will start out with currencies that fail. Any currency that's strong will live pretty long but when it starts failiing bitcoin will inhale it.

@_date: 2017-12-20 08:32:25
Not really, you already missed the boat. I made a little flip but it's to late now. I tried a second time and I'm taking some losses on the second attempt. These boats pass by VERY fast. It was a pump and is going to dump back down. Coinbase definitely manipulated it and a lot of whales took advantage. Those whales will dump very soon
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:50:26
I would get my foot in through the front door. Don't take a big step, just a little step so you can experience the volatility and get a better understanding what it feels like.(you might also end up getting lucky, price just the other day was at 17k) It takes months of bitcoin studying to have a good feel on what hodling pyschology feels like.  Everytime bitcoin gets attacked, you will feel it. People who held for years pretty much earned that money for survivng the holding through all those attacks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:23:12
"LOL" because this moron sold at 13k when he could of sold at 19k. and yet he "knew" this from the start, here's another LOL. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:59:36
I made numerous transactions all going through less than 20 minutes. I honestly never have problems with transactions. I use segwit wallets and pay the highest fee. I only paid like 30 dollars to move around over 10 grand
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:32:44
One of the main reasons bitcoin has so many unconfirmed transactions is because of shit loads of micro transacations. That was one of it's vulnerabilites to attacks. So this will greatly change that so fees will drop as well. Fees never were high. They're only high during congestions.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:43:01
I totally understand, Personally I have zero fear because I know I bought in before 6k and I don't believe the price can drop below 8k again although I do believe it can still drop down to 8k.  So I understand people's fear who bought in 12k+ , they're vulnerable to panic sell on any type of 'bad' news they see or hear. When I first bought at around 2.8k I held through all the attacks and drops as a newbie which I gotta admit was so really hard. That's why I respect the holders. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:37:24
You definitely seem like you know what your talking about, so you seem to have a good understanding of this. 
Most people prefer to store in a hardware wallet as their main choice of security. The hardware wallet with the private key(seed words) written on a piece of paper. The piece of paper with these words being the most valuable piece of information as this 'key' can be used to restore your bitcoins if the hardware wallet is ever lost or for some reason doesn't work. So this paper with the seed should never be typed anywhere on a device connected to the internet. And you want to make sure this paper is stored somewhere where nobody else can have access to it. So each one of them can have their own hardware wallet as well as the piece of paper with the seed words. It will cost a bit extra for you considering hardware wallets have to be bought but I wouldn't say it's expensive. Actually pretty cheap I'd say. The two most trusted is the TREZOR and the Ledger nano s.
As for reputable in what I trust only because it's what I ever only used- GDAX, Coinbase and Gemini. I currently use Gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:07:11
What are you confused about exactly? You sign up with an exchange, get verfied and now you can instantly buy/sell bitcoins.
It can get more complex but that's the real simple way of doing it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:39:20
of course it matters when people are using shady tactis to lure in newbies. That's fucking evil and corrupt and shows how much bullshit you're made out of. Referring to the overall support of that coin.

Fees are barely higher. I paid nearly the same in fees using segwit so that's bullshit. Bch is suppose to be an upgrade. It's BARELY that. I didn't notice a major difference at all. I rather wait for a REAL upgrade, not some bullshit 1% better 
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:55:40
that's how I started. Now when the price goes down, my mood only goes down when I don't have extra money to put in !!!! I'm still depressed I didn't get to put money in the last 2 dips. IT sucks living check for check. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:28:55
Honestly nobody gives a shit. Coinbase fucked a lot of shit up and didn't even have the decency to make technical aspects a priority.
Bitcoin was going to get this attention regardless. We didn't need coinbase. Coinbase is like a damn bank, in fact I wish another exchange would take over. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:16:28
I'm just lumping most of you. That's why I said most. It's the truth, Although you are right, there are some older folks who greatly understand bitcoin. I get all my knowledge from andreas antonopoulos who's in his 40s. He's a bitcoin god in my opinion. But yeah the other day I noticed some 60 year olds talking about bitcoin. I was excited to see that.
But all of all honesty, how many of your friends can you talk about bitcoin on an understanding level without them judging you some kind of way? I can't even talk to my girlfriend about it let alone my parents or grandparents. They just can't comprehend it at all and automatically think about stocks everything goverment related. It's honestly sad that the've been so brainwashed that they can't comprehend this beautiful technology.

the crazy part is all 3 of the coins are all acting the same way whenever it goes up and down. Makes you wonder if it's one very rich smart person or just a very rich smart group of people. Maybe they're also testing out the market to see what they're capable of doing. They can potentially control their own future contract bets lol but than again none of the other coins have futures and they're all acting the same way.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:02:20
whenever you notice like 7+ different coins all going down in price it usually means all that volume will be pumped into bitcoin, And knowing the news for tomorow is more of an indication to that. These are things you start picking up after weeks/months of really paying attention to this 'market'
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:13:53
damn that's a tough choice since it's half of it all. would you say your currently living good money wise of your monthly expenses? 
Bitcoin is definitely in it's early days and a btc going for 25k would already make a huge difference in your holdings. In the state we are that seems pretty likely to happen sooner than later based on how quick we saw the price jump to 19k without truly going mainstream. But are you going to be following the bitcoin community everyday? This might torture you. Seeing the attacks bitcoin gets and FUD, you might go through some pyschologic damage unless you have a good self of awareness. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:31:27
I doubt it. Most people will see this as a big dip and a huge amount of buy orders are probably already set. As fast as it hits 10k will be as fast as it shoots back up. We are no longer in a little fish bowl. We are a river starting to pour into a ocean. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:45:00

What the average person fails to realize is that EVERYTHING is a god damn bubble, real estate had one of the biggest bubbles but real estate is going very strong now.

@_date: 2017-12-15 06:14:12
Transaction fees always were low. It's only high when the network is conjested. It is conjested and might be for a little while because of the mainstream adoption coming to bitcoin. Also depends on what exchange/wallets you use, for example coinbase doesn't have segwit enabled so users pay more for their service although other exchanges have the same service but cheaper fees because they have segwit enabled.
Also Lightning Network aka LN should launch next year, I'm sure that will make a big difference depending how long/fast it takes companies to implement it. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:36:29

Sure you can give me whatever info you got on bch so i can see what they think is in the future. 
At the end of the day I support bitcoin for taking the decetralised road map. That's the most important factor to me. Once you go centralised it's over, you start losing control and that's my main reason of btc&gt;bch . Yes I rather pay higher fees to stay decentralised because we are a protocol that can always be upgraded via softforks with upgrades like LN and theres at least 3 other upgrades being worked on for more scalability as well as privacy! 
I'm just curious how serious bch is taking their development because I've seen to many shady things from them 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:37:14
it's about being aware of your thoughts and emotions and not succumbing to them. Our minds constantly lie to us. Our mind can easily create synthetic happiness and that's kind what yours wants to do with the money. it will never be real unless you can find a pure way to do it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:13:05
Yeah no shit. He's clearly casuing manipulation. And I know he has no development which is even more sad that people look at him as the leader of BCH. I respect the core team for sticking to bitcoins plan in decentralization, that's the point of a softfork to do things without rushing. Forcing a hardfork and forcing people to automatically follow these consensus rules that lead to centralization is foolish. Keep heading that route and bch will be fully stored in computers only in China.  At least the core team has many mapped out projects. And to the dumbass shills who hate on LN, Roger himself said bch will probably implement it as well. I would like to know how many projects are mapped out for bch? Anything regarding privacy or scaling or anything for that matter?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:20:49
it's a custom sell order. For instances I can set up a sell order at 18k right now, so when the price hits 18k the exchange will automatically sell it for you. You can do this for both buying and selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:39:27
Also are you over the age of 30? I assume you are and I have a couple reasons as to why. It mostly has to do with your financial perspective. As a new Yorker I know a lot of people in that field and they all think the same way.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:25:33
There's a lot of action going on because people are getting ready for the CME exchange to launch so conjestion will stick around. 
Fees will get cheaper when scaling solutions get solved. As of now micro payments are definitely not worth it. Bitcoin is acting more like a store of wealth until it's scaling solutions get solved. LN will help out with scaling a lot and segwit already does help except that not many companies hired any coders to implement it. 
Micro payments will be really cheap, bitcoin just hasn't reached that phase yet.There's multiple open projects all being worked on for different things such as scaling and privacy. These things cannot be rushed for obvious reasons. I just think the devs didn't expect the mainstream to hop on the bandwagon so fast. Bitcoin been around for 9 years and it wasn't just until the last few months where the price literally went from 2k to 17k....

Be thankful you can say that my friend! I still owe 2k in rent from November and yet have to buy gifts for the fam lol. 2k is a lot of money to the average person living check for check. 
But using my street knowledge, I am telling you it's not worth doing that. Because she won't actually be coming back to you, she would just be using you pretty much. You're better off hiring some sexy hookers to fuck. You'll find the right girl when you don't have to buy her attention!!! trust me on that!!  I use to be a shy kid and use to buy my friends drinks and shit, it was like i was paying for the attention, paying to be 'cool'. Money is the root of evil, if she only comes to you for money, it's opening the door to something evil.

Of course it's volatile. It has to be adopted by the world... I Don't think people are looking at the big picture. Bitcoin is not your local bank, it's much bigger than that. 
Bitcoin will stay volatile until it succeeds through social networking and store of value, this will take away it's volatility. This stuff doesn't happen in days. Crypto currencies are still in early stages. They're all still in the very first stages of social networking so volatility will stick around until it gets bigger and bigger

Wow if this is true than you're a guardian my friend. Also that clipboard code sounds scary. Does that basically mean as soon as someone right clicks "copy" on their btc address, the code changes the copied address to his address? How easy is it for the attacker to put this code on someone OS ? Do they have to download it? Or can it be done silently ? and once the user hits "paste" wouldn't it show the attackers address instead of theirs? I assume new users don't triple check the address. 
Also what languages in code are best to learn to understand this stuff better? for languages in code are used to write those codes? And what languages would you suggest to learn to be able to stop/track the hackers sort of like how you did? I have a high interest in coding and since I have a lot of dedication with bitcoin I would love to find these kind of people, I know they're everywhere. I constantly get these hackers in my social media sending me all kinds of links, I know many fake instagram pages that advertise all kind of bullshit with shady links as well. (I like to spread knowledge about crypto in my social media but this has been making me a target)
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:00:14
It appears to me that you think the government needs to remain in control of us to keep the economy going.You don't believe that people should be their own banks. That's something I cannot agree to. For a different perspective I would encourage to watch some of Andreas's videos on YouTube. He's a security expert and makes a lot of valid points on how bitcoin is designed to take over the failed banking systems. I'm not an expert to explain on his level so I would suggest to hear his point of view if you consider yourself educated
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:29:45
I'm here for the actual technology behind bitcoin. This mess doesn't matter to me because it's going to have the same outcome. I'm not a day trader so these dips don't really matter to me. These dips only happen so whales can profit from panic sellers, but either way the price will keep going up despite the dips.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:42:57

@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:43
I agree with that as well. But there's no way they will take it back down to that. They all know bitcoin has the potential to reach over 100k so easily. I think they will just run their own like algorithm's on making small dips and large profits the entire ride.

I don't care what you think. Like I said, I just did a flip that involved numerous trades between both coins and they were pretty damn equal. Sure bch is slightly better with somewhat smaller fees (although with segwit fees were nearly the same...) Bch is barely better and that being said means it fucking sucks. We need a real upgrade, not something that is slightly better. Bch would fall real quick with all this volume because they have no real deveoplment going for scaling in the future
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:58:30

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:02:27
On this bch run up I managed to make a nice flip. Trading both btc and bch the transactions went through around the same time for me and the fees weren't that much of a difference. So I don't see the sunshine in bch. I have way more hope for LN because based on the flip I just made , bch is barely an improvement at all. Bch needs a lot more work if they want to consider themselves a much better improvement. Hopefully LN will make things smooth.

If you don't know why than you should research about the technology to understand it better. Are you aware of the backed up mempool?

Bitcoin is backed by proof of work. USD is not backed by anything because they can just freely keep printing it out. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:05:33
What you describe as good debt sounds like a lot of lies politicians say just to justify increasing taxes. The fact debt is consistently going up while dollar value is going down every year (and jobs aren't giving raises out the ass every year) is just showing the obvious sign of a failed system. This system use to be great but this system failed to stay up to terms with society and now takes advantage of society. This system was created 100 years ago when the first system failed. Now another 100 years later bitcoin was created because this current system is failing us.

@_date: 2017-12-08 07:13:49
Jesus do any of you guys do any actual research about fees. Obviously this is just temporary. Just holdd your 50$ there until transactions start clearing up and it'll be a lot cheaper. Also don't forget coinbase doesn't support segwit. Segwit makes fees even cheaper. 
50$ is fine to leave in coinbase, other fools leave many thousands. But 50 is no risk, you can definitely leave it there until fees drop by a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:01:54
Interesting, so I can probably buy low on an american exchange since im UD based anyway, and I can transfer btc to the korean exchange and then sell their for a higher price. But then I am stuck with the KRW and I can't do anything with it unless I have a Korean bank account, correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:06
It's dead in the sense that it cannot be traded. But it will not lose it's value, bitcoins no matter where they are will always have the value of the constant current price.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:46:29
I sort of agree. And sadly most people over the age of 40 cannot see in the future. They can only see what they've been taught their entire life.  2 weeks ago I had a good half hour argument with my good friend who is 36. He kept trying to argue that bitcoin isn't backed by anything and the dollar is backed by gold. Which is hilarious becauses the dollar is the biggest bubble to ever exist when you look at all the debt and money being printed while the dollar value keeps going down meanwhile bitcoin is actually backed by proof of work.
But anyways a few days ago I gave him his first 50$ in bitcoin and since then he's hooked on it. He had no actual knowledge about it. Most of these older folks don't understand bitcoin AT ALL. They just say what their taught or what they hear from those retards on the news channel who literally have no idea what mining is or what anything in bitcoin is for that matter.

jesus where's your common sense? I'm helping BTC more than BCH, IF you had any common sense you can do the simple math that I USED bch to make a hefty profit. ( I bought multiple coins at 2k and sold at 3.6k)  and everything sold WENT BACK TO BTC which means I did nothing at all for bch and put even more money into BTC. I can't believe you didn't comprehend that. I do this with many coins and they all end up back in BTC. you probably don't know how to day trade that's why. And like I said I took this chance of making a profit to also consider it as a test so again you aren't using any common sense. I did this for a profit, yes no fucking shit sherlock. But it was also the perfect time to consider it as a test since I don't use bch it was a great chance for me to test it. DUHHHHH.

You have no idea what your talking about. The way this system is designed keeps people in poverty. That 2% is a big loss because all of a sudden everything has to raise in value meanwhile the dollar is going down are paychecks are not getting higher. This is a big loss for every day people whp live check for check which is most of society. 
If banks would collapse I would have no problem because it's value would turn into bitcoins and my bitcoins will go up. This is the point of bitcoin, to take over currencies that fail and right now the USD is on the path to failure.

The true holders all know this and we are all waiting for the perfect time to buy, just kinda hard picking the right moment.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:13:56
it depends how big the transaction is. But either way the fee is always changing. You should look into how fees work.  For example fees will be cheaper if you are using something segwit enabled. And soon fees will be exremely cheap once LN is fully running and stable but that's something to come in the next few months. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:02:08
I think andreas antonopoulos would have a better argument than him. I don't think paul is speaking on the behalf of governments around the entire world.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:27:27
This is just because of the surge of the storm. Normally fees are actually really cheap. But because of the conjestion the fees are definitely high. You can learn more about how fees work if you choose to learm about it. It won't always be like this. Think of it as the cost to make a profit because that's basically what it is at this point.

Thanks for the insight, I appreciate it. Since I don't plan on selling for a couple years, I suppose a lot of new information about this type of stuff will come into the light. 
Something that confuses me a bit is, what if a average joe who got into crypto has no idea you have to report it on your taxes and this average joe sold for a meezly 10 grand profit. If he doesn't report it, is this breaking the law despite not being aware? I thought it's someones job to inform the person that they owe money since it's not very clear that it's being taxed to an average joe. 
To my undestanding, it seems like the IRS doesn't say anything to you until years later and then they decide to slam you with a bunch of shit that they been collecting but you had no idea of it. So I guess my last question is, is there a way for you to find out what the IRS knows about you? or is that secretive ? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:53:56
LOLLL anyway we can find this broad ?

This is a bad time to sell, that boat has already passed. This is the holding phase. and Tai isn't really the best to listen to. He been telling his fans to buy coins like IOTA and Qtum which barely have support.  I feel like Tai just helped his billion dollar friends do pump and dumps
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:52:44
it is a tough time to get in because of the huge flood that came in past couple days. The network is congested which is making fees really expensive at the moment. 
But anyways you can actually learn about that and how it works to better understand bitcoin. Most newbies choose to not learn the fundamentals of bitcoin and end up lost half the time.
The sidelines have some good info for newbies. One of the best sources for technical information on bitcoin is andreas antonopoulos on youtube. Also bitcoin.org is a pretty good place to get started, they help you choose your wallet and exchange to get started with. But don't forget to do your own research on everything you see and hear. Been here like 6 months and everyday I feel like I learn something new about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:18:44
I was referring to the one a couple months ago that dipped from 5k to 3k, that was almost half the price but lasted less than a week 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:12:53
People keep saying washed up comments like that without even understanding the fundamentals of becoming a currency. What you need to understand is bitcoin is worldwide. So in order for bitcoin to really become a worldwide currency it needs to grow through it's social network. As this grows , the same time it's becoming a store of value because we trust bitcoin more than banks. Because bitcoin allows us to be our own bank. As it's getting less volatile because it's becoming a store of value then it can be widely be used as a currency worldwide. 
 
And that's why we hold because we are still in the very early days. Not even 2% of the world is in bitcoin which means we are still in the early social networking part of becoming a currency.

@_date: 2017-12-08 08:42:12
if it's far to much you shouldn't be complaining because of all the profit it brought to you ;) 
But anyways this is a bad time to move the coins around anyway, you know the mempool is overflooded right now with transactions, we have never experienced this type of surge before and in my opinion the system is still working great considering the millions of people and millions of dollars that got flooded in here in a matter of just days and the only problem is that transacations are backed up which will clear up anyway. I would just hold tight until they start clearing faster
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:47:21

That makes no sense. I specifically want to know about BITCOIN and the events that were going on with bitcoin during a specific time period. That is literally asking about bitcoin, how can you say otherwise , I don't understand that.. Sure you can say it also has to do with the forum software but not entirely.

oh please dude "people cant use bitcoin anymore" since when is holding using? You cant use any coin for anything you moron. Every coin is in early stages and are unusable in the online market.That's why we hold and it doesnt cost any fee to hold.

I would like to know the same thing. Every time I ever traded btc and bch they were always around the same speed. and when I use a segwit wallet even the fees are nearly the same !!! so bch is garbage because it's barely am upgrade. It's maybe technically slightly better which really means it sucks. Bitcoin needs a real upgrade and that's why I'm looking forward to lightning network

100% holding. I honestly don't think this is a risk at all. 
If people really think this exchange came here to short us 1 time and then leave than they're a bunch of fools.
These exchanges want bitcoin to be 100k+ , can you imagine how much money they would make riding the waves instead of just a big short.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:24:27
But what I don't understand is how you don't see the other side of this. They're all about greed, we know this. So why in the world would they want to come here to short it 1 time'? That makes no sense, they are aware bitcoin is unregulated and can be 100k+ in price. They would make WAY more riding the waves with bitcoin making their dips along the way.
And miners will actually be using Future's a lot as well.
And I took the risk at day 1. Now it's not a risk to me anymore after all the time I've spent learning about how bitcoin really works and it's potential and changing the world

You think it's just 2 systems? haha! those were 2 examples buddies. Nearly every currency is on the path of failure. How can you not see it? If you can't stand up for those 2 governments what makes you think you can stand up to the rest? They will each go down 1 by 1 dude. Do you not realize the revolution we are entering in the world of technology. I think anyone with common sense would agree crypto's are going to be a huge part of the future especially blockchain technology. Do you understand blockchain technology ? I bet the banks are going to try and use it because like I said they're all outdated. 
I think we can end the discussion here, I made my point, Bitcoin will inhale every currency that begins to fail and they will fall 1 by 1 like domino's. It's already happening and been happening. Based on this discussion it seems like you only understand the american government and it's banks and I'll be honest, bitcoin will not dent the american dollar anytime soon. But I don't see a future for the american dollar in 100 years and especially not the poorly outdated banks so they will succumb to it eventually. 
As for bitcoin in 100 years , way brighter future for people and for the world. Bitcoin already is more advanced than banks when it comes to coding. Coding is what's going to make our future. Bitcoin brings together the worlds greatest developers. When it becomes more adopted technology is going to advance on a much faster pace than it would with the outdated banks.
But anyways peace and love despite perspective differences. But at the end of the day, I know you're here for a reason. To see what the buzz is and to see  if you can potentially make a profit haha! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:10:15
Bitcoin has history and been around for 9 years without ever actually being destroyed. Bitcoin established trust in it's technology. Bitcoin is the leader and we are in very early stages of crypto so talking about other coins is pointless because they're all in early development.  Everyone believes in bitcoin because of it's technology and it's capabilties of being revolutionary.

you do realize it's already been 9 years since BTC has been out? And people said the same thing years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:56:01
interesting, now lets say you don't report it. Is there anyway to know if they know about it?
I know if you keep your coins in an exchange and sell from the exchange than of course they will keep a file on that. But what if I create multiple different wallet addresses and move the coins between the addresses before I convert it to another coin. Will they be able to trace these addresses to figure out who the OP is? Considering that your also masking your OS IP address and other security measures. 
I just wannna get a better understanding of what the IRS is capable of in Crypto so I understand what hole I might end up digging for myself.

@_date: 2017-12-08 14:42:05
sure you can but will need to claim it on your taxes. to make it legit. Personally I wouldn't deposit it all at once. Deposit it in variables such as 5k at a time so you don't have to claim it on your taxes. If you sell it for cash they can't trace that.

@_date: 2017-12-01 14:24:38
what website is from the nicehash? I might try that out on my gaming laptop since I use it at work I wouldn't have to pay electric lol.
but yeah I usually throw in a little after every check but I started at around 3k so I made a decent amount. But it's never to late. I still bought in at 8k. Bitcoin really has the potential to reach 50k. But just remember dont risk what you cant afford to lose

@_date: 2017-12-25 09:41:07
150$ is like 1 dollar to any multi millionaire/billionaire (which is the exact type of wealth needed to spam a network). I guess it depends on how many of these orders are going through. If it's really that many than I highly doubt it's people just naturally buying that exact amount. But I do agree it's more likely to be regular people buying. I first assumed it was like 10$ being spammed. But 150 does show a lot more legitmacy 
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:39:18
LOL are you seriously putting words in my mouth now ? Get a grip dude! I edited my question because I asked it in the wrong way at first WHICH is what the first replies refer to so again what your saying is irelevant. 
 I'm telling you what I mean to ask right now and you're literally ignoring it, how can you be so damn ignorant?  I'm asking for what bitcoin's history was like around August, what the community of bitcoin was voicing during that time in GENERAL, NOT WITH JUST REDDIT. So please stop putting words in my mouth because I have since changed my question multiple times but you keep changing my words.

yeha man sorry for coming in hard on you. It's just so much drama that been happening lately and sometimes it's hard to tell when someone is a newbie or when someone is from another sub coming here trying to spread fud. If you are a newbie you wouldn't really know what I mean so I apologzie for being rude.
But anyways, definitely leave the 50 in their until things cool down, when it cools down that fee will be less than 5 dollars. Coinbase is definitely most user friendly which is why so many newbies go their and that's why they dont have segwit so they can make big profit. First you can contact them and send them an email to tell them you want segwit implmented (on twitter coinbase said the reason they dont have it is because they weren't getting enough requests for it, which is bullshit but I guess everyone can start sending them emails and shit and they will add it eventually)
What you should actually do is get verified with GDAX, They work with coinbase actually and GDAX has way cheaper fees and I believe they work the same way as coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:03:52
so then who owns the trademark of bitcoin? and like i asked, if someone owns that trademark, doesn't that mean this person can just change it or sell it whenever they feel like?

Becareful with apps, don't download just any app. An app can be designed with a code in it that can steal information from your device. Make sure the app is trusted and well known before using. 
I don't use any app for trading personally. I trade on my desktop but I do have a mobile wallet in case I need to move some coins around.
I haven't personally researched any apps for trading enough to have a suggestion. I would like to know myself from some exerpienced traders who use apps for that.

I noticed when this was first uploaded here, I beleive the shills kept it downvoted so nobody can see it. 
This is a video with 2 of the devs of bitcoin being interviewed and some journalist from forbes who's suppose to have an unbiased point of view.
I really like the devs working for core, When I compare them to bcash it's obvious who cares more about the future. Bitcoin devs are calm and collective, you can tell they're serious about their work.
edit* Roger isn't a dev but he is like (or he IS) the CEO of Bcash and is basically representing that coin. 
When I watched the video on Roger being interviewed he was attacking the interviewer and degrading him non stop just because he's wealthy, he kept using his wealth as a defense which is a huge sign of insecurity. In other words, you'd be a fool to trust someone like that.
I think it's important for the users to see what kind of people are working on the projects.

The main part about wallets is controlling your private keys. That's what you need to learn about 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:44:54
To sobby man. This isn't just a lesson for you, this is also a lesson for the people who didn't want to make their own wallet. So they are just as equally responsible to that loss. So you shouldn't feel the blame for losing theirs. And you lost yours on your own fault. You have to respect the jux and take that loss. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:23:46
Your information is still correct but that doesn't change the evil roots behind USD which you can look into yourself. That's another reason people support bitcoin to not support the USD.

The point is we didn't need this jump. You're just being greedy. Coinbase brought a bunch of noobs and didn't even bother trying to teach them anything. Bitcoin was going to get this adoption regardless. Maybe not as fast but we didn't need it this fast. The world is barely ready for bitcoin, they don't even know what private keys are because coinbase doesn't educate it's customer's. Coinbase will be an enemy of bitcoin.

yes I definitely want to learn as much as I can. The good thing is, I don't plan on selling maybe for a good 2 years or so.

Yeah I keep trying to think of ways to use what I have to try and flip it  with the sell at highs and buy at lows but I see way to often many stories of people losing money by trying this. 
I guess for now my plan is to see how low the first dip will be from the futures and what the next high will be when they re-buy.  After seeing that I think we will have a better judgement on what to do. But regardless holding is still the guarenteed safest way lol.

I think BTC is to risky for them to really manipulate in full control. There's to many millionairs and billionaires involved. Unless literally they're all working together than I just don't think it's possible.
Also I don't think it's in their best interest to short btc this early. They know this market is not regulated and has so much potential in money. If they want to short btc than they will do it all year long every year while btc continues to grow. They're just gonna be on the side line making their profits like all the other whales. 
So basically the way I see it, they want btc to succeed because the more btc succeeds the more potential in money they can make.

You know what I find funny, I've been using bitcoin righ tbefore august and since then I never had to wait more than 5 seconds for a transaction and my fees are always very low. And that's why I see Bcash as a total scam because they tried so hard to steal bitcoins user base by spreading that FUD meanwhile I never had those problems. Not only that but at least bitcoin has on going projects such as LN that will better it's future. I feel like Bcash isn't really doing anything for it's future. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:57:02
It's about bitcoin threads based on 6 months ago but the way I asked the question it's based on reddit's post archiving system. It's still both because I want to know what bitcoin threads were posted around august., that's what I specifically came here for.  A bitcoin user can still help out with this hence why I asked this question here.
 and I'm just very surprised reddit mechanics lack this type of information. But thanks.

Crypto is definitely the way forward. I just feel like majority of people cannot comprehend how beautiful this technology is. Everyone is so brainwashed by the goverment that they literally can't fucking imagine a world without being controlled. This is the problem. These people don't realize the point of bitcoin is to finally unite the world into one.
The sad truth also is that bitcoin wasn't ready for this elite mainstream adoption yet. I say this because it's not simplified enough for them. People are fucking like air heads when it comes to the internet which is sad because the internet is basically the biggest part of everyones lives now a days, literally. That being said, The internet of money is bitcoin, that being said, bitcoin is the future. 
In my opinion bitcoin will advance technology waaay faster than banks do (in fact banks slow us down INCREDIBLY as humans in this world) and really make the world a better place since people from shit hole countries can finally be their own bank.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:29:28

Coinbase is possibly one of the worst places to buy crypto. OVer-priced fees and ran by a CEO who's pretty shady based on past things I read about him. You should always be wary about something that attracts the noobs. Since majority of their customers are newbies, they can easily get away with so much. 
On the other hand, GDAX which is also owned by coinbase is a lot smoother to use. Coinbase it's self is crap.

Do not listen to anybody. Just educate yourself on what a hardfork is. Right now you are in the Bitcoin sub, the actual BTC. The other sub is supporting an alt coin which was hardforked off of Bitcoin. It's a set of rules that all users are forced to listen to which usually make it more centralized. Bitcoin went with a softfork which allows the users to make their decision on their own pace which essentially keeps it decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:15:19
Almost the entire first half is based on LN. 
And the one you are comparing to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:47:00
All of these coins will eventually go back up. If you time it right you can ride the boat and make some profit. The only hard part is predicting how low it will drop to before going back up. and the question is, who's going to go back up first.

People are here for BITCOIN not an ALT COIN. These shady assholes are simply trying to steal the bitcoin name in anyway they can which involves spreading lies.

If you have such a well understanding than you should be able to conduct research on this. You know you can even view the live transactions being made to see what kind of people are buying and you'll see that it is supply and demand with  a lot of new whales joining in as well. This amount of money is not really enormous, bitcoin is still under valued. It's only enormous because of how fast it happened which is no surprise really, this is something taking place WORDWIDE. Not just 1 nation homie. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:16:30
and it'll probably pass 16k today. This has to be the strongest bull run in bitcoin history so honestly I don't think anyone has a real clue of what's going on. This price can stop and go down any given moment but it also can keep going up with no brakes until who knows when. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:49:24

actually it's essentially easier to hold coming in now because it's the only thing you can do when everyone else can sell. 
But regardless it's totally reasonable. Even just holding 200 dollars in now, if the price goes to 1 million in just a couple years, you made a nice amount by just holding that 200.

I'm speaking for all crypto's. This world isn't ready for that type of adoption yet. Bitcoin will be the first mainly used crypto currency when LN comes out which will hurt all other coins but will also help all other coins. 
You will be able to buy coffee with bitcoin in 2018 but that's not the point. Tell where the heck you can go buy coffee witth any crypto? Stores won't start accepting crypto until it's trusted enough. Bitcoin will be the first coin to bring trust to crypto's. Bitcoin will be the first mainly used crpyo currency.

If you flood any market at this rate, they will have problems especially when it relies on miners. It is working how it's suppose to work, it's just delayed. Also don't forget to use segwit. And don't forget about the soon to come upgrades to the protocol which you failed to acknowledge for some strange reason.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:53:27

@_date: 2017-12-08 08:36:00
It's apart of the process really. Bitcoin grew way to fast at once, this is why we are experiencing this. So we are basically paying a fee to get in on the profit. And as long as you keep holding when the new upgrades come out it's going to send bitcoin to the moon.

I think you should wait another month. Since bitcoin has the most mainstream you'll get way more business out of it. Just wait for the upgrade to the protocol. 
In the meantime if you need one like right now, I would do litecoin. There's to much speculation from BCH and it would just confuse your costumers. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:10:08
The liars are the assholes coming here to hate. Like I said if you are a hater than just get out. I paid a regular high fee, I paid 30 dollars to move 10 grand and I moved my coins twice and both times moved less than 30 mins. BCH also took about the same time to move with fees less but not impressive at all if you look at the difference in volume. I thought bch is suppose to be way better ? it's only SLIGHTLY better which means it fucking sucks. We need a real a upgrade not a slightly better one. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:58:45
I don't think that really makes sense, if that's the case than where is the actual BCH sub? Every other coin has their own sub but where's BCH? If we are implying that the BTC sub is BCH than obviously there would be some some type of hostility against the btc people.

I remember putting everything I saved up into bitcoin like 6 months. Was less than 3k but still a lot to someone who lives check for check. My money at least quadrupled since then. But I wouldn't go all in because you will be vulnerable to panic sell when the price dips, it will affect your daily life through emotions unless you develop the skill to just hold and don't get affected by the FUD.

@_date: 2017-12-28 10:35:54
Well that's why I said "like"  lol because I know it wasn't literally a conspiracy. But I have to agree with the upgrade, it's the reason majority of the community supported the SF instead of the HF. The HF essentially makes it more centralised giving chinese miners most of the power. I stayed with the SF to prevent that, which is why segwit only increases the block size to 2-4mb. (transacations would be fast and fees would still be cheap if majority of companies adapted faster)  In my opinion that hardfork was just a 'quick fix'  and they have been doing a great job marketing their 'quick fix' by claiming cheaper fees. But a quick fix is not healthy long term in my opinion so I stayed with the SF which lets you work on your own time instead of being forced to follow the consensus rules. 
 I guess it depends on what BCH road map in projects looks like for the future but if I'm aware correctly, they don't really have any open projects. I am aware bitcoin has a few including one that will help with privacy more.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:37:36

@_date: 2017-12-21 09:43:21
Why in the world would you want to make payments right now? When a currency needs to grow as a store of value first, it's stupid to use it for payments. 
Payments are not a priority. Scaling is and bch has no projects for it's future which means it would most likely fail if it had the same volume as bitcoin. Bitcoin has way more volume going on plus many projects for it's future. Priorities first.

Well in this revolution we are heading towards, there will be a third thing to add to that and it'll be something like "tech smart". You'll probably be one of few older folks who have that. If you are able to understand bitcoin than  I would imagine you can figure out other parts of the internet that the average older person cannot.

Ah okay, This is even more reason to be against the USD. a currency that's been supporting an ongoing war responsible for the death of so many people including majority of them being innocent. The USD is probably the most corrupt currency in the world driven by war and based on what I understand oil is also based on fiat money which is bad for uniting the world.
The USD is like a dictator currency trying to be on top of the money chain when it's suppose to be based in the US, this fuels war in numerous ways.
Based on what the USD is backed on, it's not ideal to be apart of the future if we are looking for a future of peace. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:51:51
Not true at all. Bitcoin does so much more than just hold a value. 
Bitcoin is bringing a network to billions of people that banks don't do anything for. 
Let me ask you a question, do you actually support the banks and goverments of places like Venezuela and Zimbabwe ? Those are great examples of failed systems and bitcoin is helping change many lives there. What is banks doing for those people? I highly doubt you can answer that. Your ideologies are based in 1 nation like I mentioned before. If you can't speak for the world than your vision is small. Bitcoin is about changing the world, I think you should open your mind more and see the bigger picture
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:25:19
I have to disagree with your ways. Money is not the answer. That's cheating and hiding the real problem. You have to be able to find peace within yourself. That's the purest realest way. If you use money it's not really going to heal your deepest roots. If you are in guilt, you can open up to her and confess everything and give your realest honest apology. If there's no foregiveness than you have to move on.

It will solve the fees as long as segwit is adopted. LN needs to work off of segwit. 
Even bcash is going to need LN, Roger said it himself that he wants to add it but guess what, they would still need to do a fork so they can get segwit before they can even get LN. In other words, bitcoin is ahead of the game despite looking like it's stuck in the past. Kinda like the founder of Amazon when he use to sell only books, they made fun of him but he said he's investing into the future and look at amazon now.

I do it with a bank. But that's all I do is buy it. I don't sell it on that exchange. After it's bought the coins are moved around in places but not sold back to the bank account. Unless your telling me you get paid to actually sit there to try and trace all these addresses until you think you found where the coins ended up being last. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:54:49
It's a forked coin, just another alt coin. They tried to steal bitcoins name by calling themselves the real bitcoin and using a sub called BTC meanwhile their acornym really is BCH. They use shady tactics to manipulate the market. They can still strive next to bitcoin, I don't hate alt coins and since bitcoin is like the gold we will eventually need our copper and silver but they attacked this community way to soon trying to steal the user base which is sad.
And to my understanding they forked to have a bigger block size which also promotes centralization because of the minning. That coin has a CEO and miners basically control it. Bitcoin isn't controlled by miners and doesn't have a CEO which is why Bitcoin is the true decentralised coin. 
With bitcoin, the community decides what should be next for bitcoin. With BCH, I don't think the community has any control over that, I believe whatever goes on with that coin is controlled by the owner and miners.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:04:18
Of course man , what do you expect? Anything great comes with evil hatred and greed. You can't tap out because of the expected. This is just the start man, bitcoin is going to get attacked in so many ways in years to come.

you should have started a few hours ago because the CME news that just came out is gonna make the price go up lol. But don't worry we have a lot of things next year that will make the price go even higher and higher.

We as a community put so much dedication into bitcoin ( we aren't really skilled so dedication can vary, such as dedicated memes lol) It's important that bitcoin devs/contributors put their voice out in the media. The people attacking bitcoin are trying to use the media against us so we need stronger voices to stand up and all of us will back you all up!
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:22:20
I've heard the exact thing back when bitcoin reached 4k. Except now people can use the futures as an excuse of shorting. But really, these 'shorts' will just be 'dips' for us to buy more and increase our wealth. These 'shorts' will not actually short bitcoin. They will make it stronger except that a lot of wealthy people will be able to get weathier using bitcoin. 
People who really think these exchanges just wanna come here and short it 1 time are close minded and lack a sense of awareness. 
These futures want to stay with bitcoin until it reaches 1 million and they will be profiting along the entire way with these 'shorts' aka dips.

That will not harm it's value when it has a marketcap in the trillions. What you gotta understand is that when the first layer is really in full gear the adoption willl be so mainstream that the store of value will all of sudden be risen dramatically. Ain't nobody want to spend something that is dramatically rising, that makes no sense, This is the store of value phase. When it reaches a certain point that can be considered more 'stable' that's when you'll see markets starting to accept it as a currency starting from small business to big business's to nearly all of business's involved with the internet hence the expression" bitcoin isn't the money of the internet, Bitcoin is the internet of money". Trust me, people will spend a ridicoulous amount of BTC including me because we are all the ones who will have a lot of money so we will have a lot to spend re-circulating those coins back into the network.

I don't understand why you are even trying to compare it to gold anyway. Gold only holds a value, it's useless otherwise. 
Bitcoin is followed by the 3 layers I mentioned. Gold does not offer this. Thus bitcoin being much more valuable than gold because it shares similar properties but does so much more.
And isn't the USD suppose to be backed up by gold anyway?

This is why you should always control your own private keys. This is the number one rule in bitcoin. When you have your private key aka seed words, you always can recover your wallet if the phone is lost or whatever.
I'm pretty sure that app let's you have control of it, I guess you never wrote down the seed words. I never used the app so I'm not sure though.
But it can also be that the app is just down because of the servers.....

Where's your source? I saw an interview with bitcoin devs from months ago that clearly says LN will be out first quarter of 2018. By time it's fully adopted would probably be end of 2018. That depends on companies adoption rate

Actually I think it's pretty normal when it gets this type of worldwide attention. Just remember how hype we use to get when thew price would increase by 100$... Price has been increasing by the THOUSANDS and that hype ain't even as much as it use to be, why? Because it's pretty normal now....

Sounds like a fake stock than because BTC has no stocks. There is no  company that owns BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:05:05
That's true as well. But realistically speaking, I don't think it's possible for literally all the whales to short at the same time to cause the 40% decrease. I think realistically whales will cash out on their own time when they personally believe bitcoin is at a ATH that won't be reached again. I'm sure they all know the fun this will be for many years. The only ones to cash out will be the ones who are satisfied with their greed. And their coins will go back into rotation for a discount depending on whatever dip they cause.
But yeah really this is still all hope talk
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:59:47
Point is it doesn't matter what you believe in. It's still an alt coin and is NOT the original. You can choose to believe it's the orginal vision but regardless it is not the original coin. I don't understand what's so hard to understand about this...

Larger blocks means a larger blockchain.
A larger blockchain is harder to store on regular computers.
The fear is that it will lead to the blockchain only being fully stored on centralized servers.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:25:31
not artificial at all. I've seen so many millionaires/billionaires who encouraged their followers to buy bitcoin. This flood is the real deal. 
People already mentioned that dozens of times. That was expected from this huge wave. It will clear up like it did last time from the last attack.

@_date: 2017-12-23 05:08:01
Bitcoin never had this problem, If you been here for at least 6 months you would realize the fees only started going up when BCH forked off bitcoin. It was pretty obvious what's been going, everything they do and talk about has to do with trying to destroy bitcoin. It's an attempt of a hostile take over. There were many times people posted proof of our mempool getting spammed with tons of transactions that were like 1 cent. There even was written proof from the bch community that they plotted to spam our transactions. I don't have the source anymore, it's just what I remember since I'm always lurking.

You didn't even say anything logical here. It looks like a frenzy to you. But a lot of people buy because they actually believe it's the future, which it is. Bitcoin will advance the way we communicate in society and it will advance our technology. Banks have been holding us back.
The IRS ain't shit to a worldwide currency. 
Your right every run comes to an end and it's about time we put an end to the banks that been running for so long.

I just remember joining this sub when it had like 250k people. I already felt late to the game. I think a lot of people knew this is where bitcoin was heading, it already had that vibe. I think it just hit faster than expected.Overall the adoption seems to be going good.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:12:15
Yeah no shit, why would you try and buy something during these times? This is the worst time to use bitcoin as a currency when it's the process of growing at this rate. Of course fees will be insane. Do you even know how fees work? 
Man you guys have no idea what your doing. Let bitcoin keep growing the next couple months. Once we start passing 40k these new upgrades to bitcoins protocol will solve these issues. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:28:44
I'm sure these type of systems will still exist. The point of bitcoin is to bring a bank to all the billions of people around the world that the banking system fails. The american banking system doesn't support most of the world. The circumstances your bringing up are very specific and I think lacks looking at the big picture. Your looking at the small numbers instead of the big numbers.Instead of thinkimg about someone who already owns a business think about someone who cant even get access to a bank. all those business will gradually turn to the crypto space anyway when they realize it's the most secure. Those who fail to do so will simply fail. Just like how Amazon eats up all the business that failed to update their protocols. Bitcoin will do the same to banks. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:56:16

yeah that's pretty much exactly what it will be. When these whales do cash out, it will be a nice discount for everyone. It would only be bad if they all cashed out at the same time because that would set us back like a whole year but regardless still won't make a difference in the long run

Now how about you show me sources of your coins projects development. Oh yeah there is NONE. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:14:38
That makes no sense dude. If banking systems start to collapse that's the LAST place you'll want to borrow money from so your point is invalid. When banking systems start failing people are going to flock to a secure store of value. Gold is useless so they will flock to bitcoin like they already are in many parts of the world. Bitcoin will save all of those business's as long as they scale with time. They won't need to borrow money if they catch on with times, bitcoin will flow into their business and if it doesn't than their business failed. Borrowing money is a horrible point, your suggesting these humans put themselves in more debt at the same time their currency is crashing Lol how does that make any sense?
And you never answered my question about your support for the Venezuelan and Zimbabwe governments/banks. Those are good examples of failed systems which bitcoin happens to be helping those people out. So how do you support these governments and banks because you speak for the governments and banks so how do you support them?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:52:27
You definitely gotta make some moves. Coinbase is not a good place to keep your coins. And they aren't a good exchange to buy from either. 
If you plan on just holding your coins, your best bet is getting a hardware wallet. Or you can also get a mobile wallet but make sure you back it up so you control your private key in case you ever lose your phone you can recover your wallet with the private key.
As for exchange, I use gemini. Few other exchanges are great to. 
Coinbase has always proven to be very greedy. Definitely not ideal to leave your money in the hands of a greedy company

But be aware, a lot of people who come here complaining about fees and things like that are actually people from another sub from another coin that tries to steal bitcoins name. These people tend to come in here and try and lure in the newbies to their coin.

It's just a form of gold standard ? Haha. Bitcoin is a very complex protocol. I suggest you learn more about its fundamentals and technology because I don't think you even know what bitcoin actually is. And Andreas can do the exact thing as him. So maybe you'll actually like him. Your failing to realize that these institutions failed miserable when it comes to scalability.

That's ridiculous. This is the US government and IRS we are talking about. This is no threat at all to bitcoin. They're doing what they can to try and protect their USD as well as get in on some money. And anyone who has any actual smarts in this field would still know to avoid them but you are doing that at your own risk. You can still buy it with cash and they wouldn't know. They're doing this because it's tied to bank accounts. 
You're the crazy one for spreading FUD with a crazy ridiculous title like that. You should be glad this bill wasn't an actual threat. And still there's a chance it won't be passed.

By 1 billion that means majority of every other national currency would have to fail in order for bitcoin to inhale it but I don't even think there is enough national currency to make it go to a billion so that's not a good number to look at. Even by a million bitcoin will start making a big dent in other national  currencies.

@_date: 2017-12-01 14:03:57
I'm okay with this, Because they will keep our trendy-ness alive for a few months and then NASDAQ is gonna join and make us trend even more and LN is going to come out around the same time making bitcoin more reliable as a currency and oh man only good things can happen after that. Major markets will probably accept bitcoin one by one. Just how I See it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:05:37
I don't think it's failed at all. I think bitcoin is revolutionary if you think about it's capabilties. There is nothing else in this world that can connect us to the entire world borderless without judgement the way bitcoin can. Bitcoin offers decentralization in a way we never seen before because we're so use to being controlled by goverments. 
If you aren't familiar with Andreas I would check out some of his videos. He presents a good vision for it in a logical way.
He has a nice collection that covers nearly every topic
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:19:03
I think you are mislead by some users. Perhaps do your own research.
BCH is on a path towards centralization. Bitcoin had a SF to prevent that. and anyone who says LN is like the bank is spreading lies. 
"The LN is like the Internet. It routes around damage. Payments are routed through LN like packets are routed through the Internet. But LN is actually more dynamic in its topography, and more censorship-resistant, than the Internet itself. Centralization probably won't be a problem, though no one can prove it either way since LN doesn't fully exist yet.
Details: I should first mention this is adapted from something I wrote in another thread. Some users thought it was helpful so I'm adjusting it and bringing it here.
"Experts" are saying different things about the LN. I listen to experts but eventually when they disagree I have to do my own research and my own thinking to decide who is right. Also, many experts have an agenda and aren't completely unbiased. If you take their agenda into account, you might see why they disagree along certain lines.
Now for centralization. LN actually does nothing to Bitcoin at all, structurally. Bitcoin is still Bitcoin, the way it is now. LN is a layer on top of Bitcoin, which leverages the trustless properties of Bitcoin multisig transactions and hash time lock contracts and other features, to build a secure channel between peers. Then, LN has its own, separate peer-to-peer network of these peers and their channels, which it uses to trustlessly route payments from Alice to Dave through Bob, Charlie or anyone else that is on the network.
The centralization that people are afraid of is that certain hubs might become huge and the network will only be able to find routes through these centralized hubs. This is only speculation at this point. Since the LN doesn't yet exist, we can't prove what will happen or won't happen.
However, we can examine the properties of the hubs and the network as envisioned, and see if it is similar to other networks that either centralize or maintain a more loose decentralized layout. I've read the papers, looked at the developers' discussion groups, and actually played around with the testnet version of LN. Again although that doesn't prove anything, it gives me a feel for how it might work.
The best analogy I can come up with for how this is going to work is the Internet itself. The Internet is designed to continue operating even if some part of the network is damaged. It finds another route and sends the packet through that route. In fact, at any given time, your packets could go through different routes, and it's pretty resilient. The LN is designed to route payments like the Internet routes packets. If one node goes offline or becomes compromised, the payment can go through a different route with no problem.
Even the Internet has problems though. The main chokepoint for the Internet is your local ISPs. Because of geographical and physical constraints, it only makes sense for there to be 1 or 2 wires going to your house. This leads to a natural monopoly or duopoly on last-mile connections. However, the LN is actually better than the Internet in this regard. You can make that first channel connection with anyone in the world. There is no geographical or physical factor that leads to such a natural monopoly on those connections.
The other thing is that the barriers to entry for hubs/nodes in the Lightning Network are very low. It's roughly similar to the costs for running a full Bitcoin node today, plus some capital to open the channels. But you won't need as much capital as some naysayers think, because the connections are currently limited in size (Bitcoin amount) by design and to prevent major losses in case of bugs in the early versions of the system. This will actually still work fine, because LN is designed to handle small payments anyways. You won't be sending $5000 around on the LN anytime soon. You'll continue to use the base Bitcoin layer for that.
Finally, again better than the Internet itself, channels can be quickly opened and closed between nodes on the network. Unlike the Internet, where a new connection between hops on the network requires physical infrastructure, these are all virtual links, so they can be set up and destroyed as needed. If a hub finds itself not well connected to certain parts of the network, it can open a channel in minutes and solve that problem.
Because of these factors, I am pretty sure that the Lightning Network will be much less centralized than the Internet itself, and more like a mesh network. It's clearly more dynamic and adaptable than the raw physical infrastructure of the Internet.
The final analogy I want to make is to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network itself. In fact, the peer-to-peer part of the LN looks very similar to the peer-to-peer part of Bitcoin. The main difference is that in the Bitcoin base layer, when you make a transaction, you broadcast it to the entire network. In LN, it finds a route through the peer-to-peer network and only sends it along those peers. This is why LN is so much more efficient and scalable. You could make a rough analogy saying that Bitcoin is like UDP (when used for broadcasting packets) and LN is more like TCP.
In case that's not enough censorship-resistance, there's even TOR routing for the LN, so that each node doesn't know anything more than the previous and next node in the route."
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:38:09
BTC WILL be a currency. But think about it for a second, Why would you want it to be a currency now when it is so unstable? It doesn't make much sense because the price needs to go A LOt higher for it to be more stable. This is why the bitcoin devs are working on scalability and will also release LN first quarter of 2018 and will fully be enabled by the end of 2018 which will be a HUGE game changer that will probably send the price to crazy high prices.

LOL you're the liar here or you're simply a moron who doesn't know what he's doing. IF you are waiting over 24 hours than what the fuck wallet are you using? Are you even using segwit ???
I made a 10 grand flip in 45 minutes. BTC is working fine or else I wouldn't of been able to do that. 
And based on my flip BCH was only SLIGHTLY better, no where near worlds better. Stop spreading bullshit. Bch is barely an upgrade. BTC needs a real upgrade, not what bch is. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:21:55
You should avoid using coinbase. They are crooks and very shady. They also don't support one of the main things that makes bitcoin fees cheaper. So coinbase is overcharging people basically. 
Other exchanges I would say care about their customers more especially the ones who have segwit. 
Anyways, it's good to put in a 20 here and there whenever you can. IT's easier to save money with bitcoin than a bank. Bitcoin really got me into saving money.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:51:23
Yeah overall he expects by the end of 2018 the overall market will have LN enabled. I guess it sounds like it's a long time but honestly I don't think so. The first half of 2018 the nasdaq will launch bitcoin futures and who knows how much more big news we will get and once it's enabled than it will be a huge game changer which will probably sky rocket the price. 
I do wish it can be rushed out faster but I guess it's wise not to rush this type of development. In most of the video they make it very clear that their main priority right now is scalability and I totally agree with it because of the huge influx of people we are getting.

watch and listen to andreas antonopoulos's youtube videos. There's a nice selection and he's an expert on bitcoin and security in general. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:06:14
Very smart of them , why capitalize on just one group of people when you can do it to many
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:24:19
I appreciate the insight. But the reason I believe I have a slight advantage over the average person to 'test' the market with day trading is because I work overnight hours and I'm basically watching the price every 10 mins 8 hours  a night five nights a week. So I have a pretty good feel on it's up and downs.
But I do agree about the tax and that's one of the only things stopping me at the moment. Not sure if it would be worth trading if the IRS is gonna make bank on my bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:57:02
Please do more sesearch and also don't listen to people just because they say something, always double check everything. But yeah ledger is great, it's a hardware wallet. It's just a wallet. That receiving thing you clicked on is your receiving address. So when you buy bitcoin on an exchange, you can send the bitcoin from the exchange to your recieving address so then you now own the bitcoins yourself in your own hardware wallet. And please write down your private key somewhere safe and dont ever let anyone see it.. that's the most important thing , the private key. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:14:44
wow bro you're retarded. Your the one who came here to ask such a ridicoulous question with a stupid example.
Go do some actual research about bitcoin and it's fundamentals and maybe you won't have to ask a dumb ass question. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:15:07
Yes I did and it clearly states that it's moving towards a centralizing mining environment which so far has most hash power with the Chinese
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:04:48
if the hash rate just got to where it should be than I would assume you need to give it some time. It's not going to instantly fix everything lol and I'm sure they will still be flooding the transactions to prolong the attack
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:20:56
I would put in more but if expenses are an issue than yeah that's fine
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:11:00
Your not even looking at the other side of it. Yeah exactly two of the worlds largest bitcoin holders, For all you know they can have business on the side and planned a pump because they do want to make their own coin out of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:17:31
If you ask me this is just apart of the dumping process, they're just trying to make it look legit so they're using legit ways for people to start dumping. I'm pretty sure the official dump will still occur when coinbase releases it's bch
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:59:13
The IRS can't do anything to people who live in other Countries lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:27:59
So at the end of the day it's still better to do a limit order just so you can stay safe and still probably/possibly get your sale in. I guess it depends on the person if they prefer more risk for better chance of reward.
Thanks for explaing it
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:43:14
 Hey guys I made two posts but the first one got deleted as a "dupe" but the other one i had a better picture that showed the side line. In the side line they also mentioned Bitcoin on the top TWICE, the second time being about the nasdaq wanting to join in on selling futures. 
This is bullish news in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:59:20
So far every single attack we called the past numerous months was accurate so why are you here? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:54:21
That is the point. Just newbies like to make it as an investment idea which is fine as well because in a way we are investing in bitcoins future because we believe in it just like people invest in Tesla
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:12:32
been here since 250k which was literally only a few months ago haha. We will reach 1 million next year if it keeps going this rate
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:20:07
Being on this sub everyday for hours will help you predict it in the near future lol. That's how I saw the first pump before it past 900 and ended up going to almost 2400. Ever since I spent a lot of time on bitcoin, you start to get a feel for it and some kind of vibe, especially when it comes to picking up on the waves of fud attacks. Whenever there is a wave, you know something is going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:00:01
Ah so like the typical person tracking it for a year watching it reach all time new highs every couple weeks but never buying lol. You'd be surprised how many people are like that but I don't blame them. As a noob this is nerve wrecking to get into. Anyways I was unsure if I should buy as well. But I'm about to buy some more in case we start pushing to 8k. People usually buy every week somewhat small amounts and when they catch a dip that's when they buy a little more than usual.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:32:01
wait 24 hours. bitcoin will take control within 3 days
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:12:38
I believe GPU don't really do much anymore now a days, you'll be losing money mining from that. You need powerful ASIC's I believe. But you can probably mine small coins and convert to btc like someone else mentioned. But in order to make a profit in mining, I believe you need to invest at least 1500 on fairly new equipment
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:38:50
You don't really have much options since 18 is the required age for all these exchanges to get verified with. All you can do is use localbitcoins to buy bitcoin for cash or your dad can get verfied on an exchange and he can put the 20 dollars weekly into the exchange for you I suppose. But I can see why he wouldn't do that because he would probably be afraid to put his info in an exchange he doesn't know anything about
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:51:33
The moon is 200k+
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:43:24
why did you link that forum? It doesn't seem to be that active.  The greatest way is just holding. Bitcoin trading is a risky business
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:51:35
This isn't really bad news, knowing this means that companies can now advance their products to have the same type of output using less power. That's how we evolve and advance through technology
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:42:26
They work because many of them look legit. Many of these phising sites are even on the top page of google just because they paid for an ad and the average joe probably assumes anything on the top front page of google is safe

Cheers mate to the future of bitcoin~
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:10:06
Obviously BTC is growing faster , have you not been watching it the past few weeks?
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:11:04
LOL. REfreshing the bitcoin price has became an addiction for many people. I bet even people working for google saw a huge spike in the search term "bitcoin price" 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:14:05
    is a pretty good start, overall takes some dedication in self research throughout all kind of sources until it just starts to catch on
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:01:27
Thanks for those good points you've made. I was thinking of testing the market with just 1k to see how well I do. I'm definitely not going to risk using the entire half. I figure with 1l I can afford to lose some since bitcoin already made me mostly profits 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:52:25
LOL is that true ? that whoever this craig guy is, he claimed to be satoshi ? What a joke! The way that entire crypto is running is a joke! They still sit in a sub that holds our acronym, Our acronym is probably the only thing keeping them alive besides the pumpers lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:08:37
Shouldn't you technically analyze it for cyber monday? Black friday is mostly about physical stores having discounts. Either way it won't make to much a difference, we are in the very early stages.
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:44:30
if you gonna get water proof, might as well get fire proof as to. *but for that price it's totally reasonable. Falling in water is more likely than burning in fire.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:26:13
I've never waited more than 30 seconds. Interesting how all of a sudden a wave of people are saying the same crap
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:18:01
yeah check your old emails to look for any type of exchanges, you definitely had to buy from an exchange if you used the authentication 
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:37:58
eyyyy , I should hit up Madison square garden to do this
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:06:57
make sure you watch that guys youtube videos, he is the most informational person i ever heard speak on bitcoin. It's literally his life.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:54:35
That's exactly what does happen. Why do you think people on here express the term "hodl" so much? Because many people are aware of these waves and they know the best thing to do is just hold so you dont lose anything. But these pyramids cause a lot of panic and people get scared and then sell for a loss.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:54:26
Try looking back into any old emails. I believe this is the best solution since majority of all these sites require you to register with email
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:26:16
but it clearly was a pump and dump...
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:44:29
Nice you bought it in one of it's dips. If it dips one more time though don't panic. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:11:16
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:23:24
Of course it would happen in China, You missed out that they own most of the hash power. That's already a big red flag for me especially that it could lead. especially since it requires higher levels of mining and storage equipment which China has tons of. It's obviously heading in that direction. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:25:35
That's the point of hodling.If you choose to cash out at 10k than you made 2k profit and now you can't get a full bitcoin anymore because you took the 2k profit... 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:50:47
Thanks for making that point, I'll edit my post to include that in case it gets more recognition
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:57:58
seems to be apart of the attack on bitcoin at the moment with all the FUD being spread 
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:32:45
just out of curiosity, where are you 16 y/o's hearing about bitcoin? I'm seeing a lot of young fellow's popping up in here and I'm curious where you guys hear about bitcoin, such as school? 
And sure 100 is a good start, if bitcoin goes to 10k in the next couple weeks than you already made a decent amount. People like to put money in weekly and put extra money in whenever there is a pretty big dip
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:08:21
I don't know how much miners make but I know whales are definitely making millions. And whales somewhat control the miners and this is why bch is practically centralized... It's not the community that brought it up, it's the whales. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:55:03
so what do we launch at 10k? that's definitely not the moon yet
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:42:38
because of this famous post 
it started with that guys drunk post and how he mis spelled HOLDING with HODLING. And the moral of his story also implies to many people on bitcoin so it just all came together perfectly to birth out the term HODL
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:19:55
This is nothing, It's going to be in the news everyday, especially when the news outlets start getting paid to spread FUD
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:18:54
There needs to be more questions to answer that question
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:36:45
This is the link that is directed to from the bitcoin core site 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:56:23
You can always start out light, it's never to late if bitcoin is really becoming worldwide adopted then you can expect the price to pass 100k. People who don't have much to invest usually try and gradually put money it, like every week or so a little amount, substantially more when you notice any dips. Dips is when the most should be invested in. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:47:52
No it's not. It's stuck for a reason, do you even know the reason or are you just talking out of your ass because it surely seems like your just talking out of your ass.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:55:44
All time high meaning a new high record price for bitcoin like literally right now we just got a ATH cause it passed 7k
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:48:41
right after the fork and then the ATH comes in
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:20:40
it's just following it's daddy
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:46:54
oh please dude, you can barely even grow a pot plant and you think you make better financial decisions. What a joke. And yeah you already failed at Reddit because you don't even know about throwaways. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:12:10
Get started by making sure your security is high if you want to invest an amount like that. Don't do it all at once. Every time there's a ATH there always is another ATH with dips in the middle. But right now we are on a strong train because of a lot of good news. I'm not expecting any significant dip. I would put in 10 now maybe another 10 next week and then maybe 20 if you are confident at that point
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:31:42
It's not most people with bitcoin, I see way more stories of people doing big things in life thanks to their bitcoin profits compared to people saying they lost money, in fact people barely lose money with bitcoin. The only ones who do are newbies who think they can day trade. All holders are making a killing.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:30:18
Here is a list of exchanges per region, check if you see a trusted exchange in your area 
Also you can check out other stuff on that site for noob help.
I would get a hardware wallet to hold the coins. (Probably when you reach an amount that would really suck to lose in an exchange) 
For now, I would still get a trusted mobile wallet that gives you your own private key such as Electrum or Mycelium.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:09:25
it's not my fault you are adding to the spam instead of doing some simple research. Who's really the one with the head in their ass? ... 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:37:10
the crazy price changes are due to an attack on bitcoin by another coin. Miners switched to mine another coin for profit which led to bitcoin getting backed up in transactions. As soon as the miner switch back, this will be fixed. They should be switching back within 12 hours when bitcoin will be more profitable to mine again.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:58:15
nobody will trust that unless it's some type of open source software
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:16:19
LOL that was the best time to buy. Sorry you felt for all the FUD my friend
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:57:20
apparently it's only around 25 million
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:04:04
perhaps you should look into more things such as the percentage of people in BTC compared to the percentage of people in BCH. Another reason why it's not a good comparison. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:17:23
No. You hold onto it until it's a better time to be a currency so you don't end up like the 100 million dollar pizza guy.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:56:57
You should know that's not the answer I was looking for lol But anyways  I already got the answer I was looking for. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:57:28
i just bought one like a week ago, they didn't even mention this
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:40:39
so basically it's not possible to have a small setup and start profiting after a few months ?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:50:27
actually most of the holders plan on holding to at least 25-100k and once we reach 25k, there is no real crash anymore. It will pretty much be a currency by then for many markets and the price will still go up and down. But holders will not crash the price. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:57:24
not many people time it right and end up losing lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:42:00
because those assholes pay for it. These attacks are not at all easy to do. They cost a lot of money. Bitcoin is not a community that pays money to attack others because we simply don't need to. We already hold the history of the true bitcoin so others will hate and will always hate.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:55:59
Another FUD title. Bitcoin has been dominating since the very beginning... So that's not the right question. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:21:44
Thank you mods for finally pinning something useful. I mean no offense, but the mods here need to do a better job at pinning everything that's very important for bitcoin including the things the devs are working on. Please do this to make this sub more professional instead of it always feeling like a free for all.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:04:37
This is the 20 second trailer to the episode 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:45:54
oh wow thanks for that. So we are only 25 million dollars away from bitcoin hitting 10k. That's honestly not even a lot. One person can easily do that lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:46:06
your really gonna use youtube as the source? smh. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:16:30
Yes bitcoin is just like gold, hence the fact you can even mine it. But bitcoin will most likely become a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:50:17
are you serious? If you think this is just a pump and dump than you must be new to the game. IF you look at the charts bitcoin doesn't really go through pump and dumps, it's an overall upwards incline. and many people have cashed out. You can just cash out by buying a house with bitcoin, you can buy all kinds of shit with bitcoin and in the next 1-3 years I bet cashing out will become so much easier.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:12:56
if you plan on continuing to put money in it, I would just get a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:49:41
People always write things on money and that money still circulates with no problem. Doubt any agency would make a case for something like this.. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:51:09
where do you live
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:43:37
oh yeah I agree with you on that, it indeed was dumb because everybody knows with crypto's the price tends to swing literally by the second so who in the world would make a comment like that right after buying. That was probably a troll. But there's also a chance OP didn't know it was a troll and thought it would be 'valuable' to share here.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:36:41
okay dude now you should really leave because you aren't using any logic here.
Of course you have to be in the field to learn.  If you signed up for the Army but never served than you don't know what it's like to go to war. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:43:06
The China FUD I think was a bigger change in price. I hope those assholes lose money from this attack but the sad thing is that they probably made millions from the innocent poor people who bought the other coin when it was rising and now they will hold it for no reason. HODL only applies to bitcoin people. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:31:06
you should check out the whole dance on youtube. There's other parts of it that have meme potential 
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:47:52
You are obviously brain washed by a crowd. I hope you get past this weakness to see the light. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:11:14
if the price goes down you have to pay the difference. So if you buy a futures at 1,000$ for 7k bitcoin in a year, if in a year the price of bitcoin drops to 3k then you owe 4,000$. That's basically the down side. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:22:06
It's definitely a pattern, notice how we hadn't had nothing but good news lately and now this looks just like the china fud literally out of no where all at the same time... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:07:32
Not at all, The IRS just wants to make sure they make a gain on this. Their defense will be that it's to battle against money laundering.

what's a favorable time tho? it's spiking right now and will spike more with the CME launch, I have no idea whats going on but if there's no dip i don't expect one until next year.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:48:09
I'm thinking of setting up a mining rig at my job since i work in a giant building. Just not sure how illegal this would be lol ( I would be mining the coins for free using their internet and electricity)

That's like Google trying to call their next phone apple because it came out to shit. That's ridicoulous and I can't believe you don't have the clarity to see that. You're literally supporting a coin that's under the wrong name LOL. That speaks for its self.

oh yeah I bet it's mostly people running scripts to do all the work for them. But I practically am a bot considering how I'm always watching it the entire night lol. But if I'm using market limit orders that initiate the buy and selling on it's own than I don't think it would matter if I'm trading against bots or people
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:27:34
come on guys the same questions are being spammed. It's very obvious what's going on. bitcoins pool is being spammed and miners are mining the alt coin until bitcoin will be 3x more profitable which should be by monday and then bitcoin will be going back to normal.

do you hear yourself? wow I'm so glad you decided to speak because it's even more clear that bch is a total scam. how can you say something so illogical ? "there are no projects that are urgent" Sounds like there's no real devs working on any good code for that coin and you actually think it's better? clearly brainwashed. At least BTC has devs working on projects for many months and it's almost completed and it's gonna bring extremely cheap transactions plus handle scale-ability better and what changes is bch gonna make? zero..... but whatever man keep being a sheep

@_date: 2017-11-13 08:14:56
my fault, didn't know it was your channel. Only reason i said that is because you should use the initial source that it's coming from such as a official Hindi website that confirms this. If not, you should include it in the video if it's not there
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:21:10
what do you mean you want them to see everything you've done?
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:41:21
Very risky move. I wouldn't want to risk losing my btc over a pump and dump. I rather hold it out and buy the dips
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:21:10
Depending on where you live yes, anywhere around the IRS and you will have to pay. This is why it's best to hold. Rules can change in the future, the IRS can start recognizing bitcoin as a currency instead of an asset
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:51:42
yeah honestly i never understood how people have slow transactions. They must have pick that as an option for a lower fee and than expecting it to be fast.. I don't know

Your asking the wrong person but yeah one person can easily do that. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:57:32
I would try and move them before your account gets locked. Perhaps look into a good mobile wallet in the meantime and after moving it then contact them and let them what you did and see what response you get. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:11:47
what exchanges would you suggest that trades many crypto's if you live in the US? I use Gemini but this only works for like 2 crypto's

I find this funny because I always joke around with my SO that bitcoin is sometimes like a TV show. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:06:32
I'm still 50/50 with what i said, I know it can be the opposite. But being here since 2800, I've been accurate about my predictions whenever I tell my girlfriend. I talk about bitcoin all the time to her even though she doesn't understand it haha. But so far I'm surprsied with the accuracry. I guess there really is some time of pattern that you get use to overtime.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:38:28
FUD is definitely more stronger than FOMO as we seen with China and BCH (china caused bigger dips than bch with their fud compared to bch's fomo) 
I think the price is going up for many reasons including what you said, but also because bitcoin is being bought worldwide by the average person also thanks to bch, people now realize they are weak compared to btc so it makes btc even stronger. I also believe there's whale's involved with raising the price in bch just so they can sell and then buy btc. I think that plays a part which is why bch price also goes back down after it gets pumped and btc reaches a new high every time bch gets pumped. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:00:55
they have the same goals but a different approach and that's why majority of people don't like it.

You have no idea what your talking about. Adoption is going fantastic and that's the MAIN reason that scaling is a priority because of this adoption. Fees are not a worry right now and fees are not even that high and fees are going to be extremely low even for micro payments in a matter of a couple months with the almost completed projects, but the scaling projects are what's important for bitcoin to adopt to the world. May I ask, what projects are currently being worked on for bch to solve scaling problems in the future ? Are they even working on any important projects for the future ? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:23:42
I highly doubt that. What resources do you have?

And isn't it obvious why hash power is low at the moment? and isn't it obvious where hash power will go when all the big ACTUAL news comes out for BTC worldwide ? and then everything is back to normal.. and nobody is actually really complaining, seems like the only ones who are are spreading lies like the ones claiming to buy coffee with it.

I saw the first pump and called it to my SO, sadly I'm not verified with any exchange that deals that coin so I couldn't act and I missed out on some nice profits. This pump was a bit more random to me and not as big but I'm sure the price will drop back to 1k. By january when coinbase let's out their bch, probably will drop a lot more
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:24:16
I remember the devs being interviewed and they said we should expect everything as soon as the first quarter of 2018! possibly around the same time as NASDAQ might start selling bitcoin futures.

@_date: 2017-11-26 06:48:14
You don't need a middleman with bitcoin, you can buy it yourself and control your own private key so only you are in control of your money. 
What you expect to happen is based on your research. Do you understand what bitcoin fundamentally is ? Do you understand it's purpose and do you believe in it ?
In 6 months the price can still be at 9-10k but it can also be at 20k.  How much you make depends on how much you decide to keep putting in. That 200 will eventually go up but you can't expect to make that much from 200$ unless bitcoin reaches like 100k+ lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:15:44
You shouldn't trust any third party... You should own your own private key.

Hodl is the rule. I think it's to risky to play around but holding seems to always be the win. There will be lots of FUD next 3 weeks. But the rule of hodling is well adapted in this community.  So that's good under these circumstances.

It won't work because the passport has to be the same name as the bank account and debit card holder. What you can do is buy bitcoins from other local people for cash. But I don't suggest this since you may be young and they may try and take advantage over you
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:40:38
what I understand most of this pump is literally coming from the same Korean exchange it came from last time which is an obvious red flag. And this happened after Rog claimed to have most of his wealth in bch which is pretty sad that people would buy in just because of a twitter message. All I see from bch is a lot of twitter fingers. That's why I know btc has a bright future, they actually work hard on the coding and can care less about social media in fact when they were asked about bch, they didn't even have any interest in talking about them, they can care less meanwhile the other side is fully dedicated to trying to steal bitcoins name in every way possible..

No way is a 10k to 1k drop possible. Even china couldn't bring us below 3k from 5.5k. a 90% drop during this TIME of bitcoin would mean bitcoin is officially over. Obviously 4 years ago a 90% drop was much more possible but let's go back to see how big the community of bitcoin even was at the time. During this TIME, I think if bitcoin reaches 10k it will probably drop to 6k after the fork, maybe 4-5k. That will be our dip to buy in! Sadly I don't think we will see bitcoin hit 3k ever again. It would be nice one more time for a broke dude like me to buy in but I'm happy with where bitcoin is going now.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:08:58
Fear is natural feeling because it helps teach you things. I feared for maybe a few minutes until I regained my focus and understood this isn't natural and is an obvious attack. And the attack is still going because there's new users constantly posting Fud. I've never sold my bitcoins and I came in right after August and been here for about 3 pretty big dips. But the China one I think is still the biggest dip
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:03:56
apparently you didn't buy your first bitcoin.

Probably not a good time to make purchases until the transactions in the pool clear up some more from the attack yesterday (that's probably still going on)
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:44:33

 You sound like the same journalists that write those fake news articles who been saying it's a bubble since it was 1,000$. Just remember your following a coin who's mostly controlled by Chinese miners and is pumped by a Korean exchange. This we already KNOW. It's not made up shit like calling bitcoin a bubble like every fake news article does..
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:50:06
it will dip for a week maybe. but the it will keep going up until the fork , buy some now if you want because when it forks you get the split coin which is why lots of people are buying before the fork
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:23:16
Completely normal with all this FUD. Pump and dump going on with BCH before the big announcements come for BTC so they can all jump back in.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:51:41
help educate him more. It's not about just buying. It sounds like he doesn't know any of the basics such as owning his own private keys. Also help him understand how the price goes through dips so he doesn't keep buying at ATH's. Yeah these past few days was nothing but going up but we all know bitcoin goes through attacks and will have it's little dips. 
Get him to watch videos on youtube from Andreas. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:34:43
Could be just FUD , you'll hear all kinds of predictions. Even if bitcoin hits 50k you'll still hear people say bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:51:17
I'm pretty sure there's a trailer on the episode. They realize bitcoin hits 5k and one of them remembers they use to have a bitcoin wallet years ago. They check the wallet and ends up being empty but I believe the trailer also shows that one of them knows why it's empty, because they might have tampered with it. So I'm not sure what image they're gonna make out of bitcoin yet, I just hope they use some logic and talk about it's technology 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:38:03
this question is hilarious to see because I been seeing it every ATH since 3k. That being said I guess it's never to late.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:32:14
oh wow that's a good point I never heard before. All of those dead wallets with a ton of btc will be accessible in the future.

@_date: 2017-11-30 05:46:47
I would put majority of it into BTC. I see nothing but good news in 2018 coming for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:59:36
China already banned bitcoin not to long ago and it made the price drop just temporarily and then we got a new high right after. So in the long run it wouldn't have an affect, China would just be missing out in the digital gold. 
(since then bitcoin isn't actually ban in China, I forgot what happened but there was lots of FUD going around at tthe time) 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:30:07
Pretty much but most people will say it's not worth it to try trading, a lot of people who try trading end up losing money. It's usually best to just hold and not risk anything and just keep putting more money in on any 'lows'
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:50:04
Because it's only 1k away from 10k, a lot of people will buy in around that time because it's a clear confident sign that bitcoin WILL reach 10k. And plus we already passed the hardest times of bitcoin. The hardest times was getting to the first 100$. Getting to the first 100 is harder than getting to 10k. We have enough support to pass 10k no problem depending on the scales of attacks we get. Just the way I see it though
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:09:17
so did you buy stocks? Curious how that has been going for you, I use RobinHood but I'm not a big player at all
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:57:13
What are you talking about? They're rising in the dollars. Bitcoin rises in the hundreds. This is not a smart way to compare. Look at how different the prices are, you simply cannot compare both of them when bitcoin is more than 10 times the price of BCH.  That's exactly what you are missing... If they were around the same price than comparing them would be more fair but in this case you can't compare it. It would make no sense to. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:14:33
Did anyone else notice the "shit express" where for 10$ you can send a piece of shit to anyone lol Everyone should do that and send it to Roger 
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:52:06
you already missed a dip 3 days ago. There's no saying what this month will look like but we do know around middle of december we will most likely be 8k+ because of all these giant companies joining bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:05:57
no way, there's so much more hype to come in 2018
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:11:07
The way I see it, Bitcoin needs to be a store of value until it's more widespread and less volatile and then it can be used more as a currency. This is why I think BCH is a total scam because it's trying to advertise fast transactions meanwhile that's the least of our worries right now. Obviously scalability is the main priority for a WORLDWIDE currency.
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:52:57
haha this is a pretty dope one
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:44:28
And this is more proof to the overall fomo being spread. Why would you share a article this late when the profitability is about to change back to bitcoin being more profitable. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:32:01
naw man it's the same tihng. The china was dropped from 4,900 to like 3,000. That was way more scary dude, 4,900 was the ATH at that time so people thought we would never see 5k. At least now we can be confident about reaching 10k.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:34:04

Can we just have mods automatically remove posts that mention "bubble" seriously, it's the typical FUD that's been repeated since day 1. We are over 10k, If bitcoin is in ANOTHER bubble than bitcoin is a bubble mahchine that generates bubbles that don't pop. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:43:12
 Tough spot for you because you can't sleep. But many people are always put in this situation. As someone who been here since bitcoin was at 3k, i bought again when 4.9k was ATH and it dropped to 3.2k because of an attack similar to this one. We use highly use the word HODL for a reason because most people end up losing when they sell or trade and then when bitcoin goes back up they make a post talking about how they learned their lesson. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:33:59

the article should have the persons name who wrote it. You can contact them and let them know. I think we need to do this with a lot of journalists. Put them on blast and then enlighten them and hopefully they take it into consideration to listen and learn or do actual research. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:40:14
I would assume the average person getting into bitcoin now a days is 18-25. Mostly because the older heads have trouble with this technology but as bitcoin continues to improve within it's software and new applications are designed to revolve around bitcoin, it will get a lot easier to use and become more simple. Sort of like how the CME is gonna make it simple and easy for the hedge hogs 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:07:21
yeah I think that'll be best for you since GDAX is pretty much partnership with coinbase. Check it out. I think you'll have to get verified with them first so might as well get that out of the way as soon as you can
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:05:54

I would like a guide that points out everything you need to buy. I want to set up my own mining rig as well but have no idea of everything I would need to buy for it to work.

Fortunately governments have so many weak points when it comes to tech stuff. How many times are governments hacked by random hackers? not only that but to ordinate an attack on bitcoin would cost a shit ton of money with the great chance of all that money being lost. Bitcoin is also open source, meaning any of the biggest brains around the globe can simply write up a code that can protect bitcoin from a certain kind of attack. Bitcoin is in progression, there will be new things added and new security measures added. Bitcoin might be the only way we the people finally get our power back. We have been controlled by the 1% far to long. But at the end of the day, if we all united, we have more power and that's kinda what bitcoin is doing, it's uniting people from all over the world.

This is apart of the development of bitcoin. Attacks will always get more advance and as these advancements happen bitcoin can adjust accordingly to combat them. But don't forget, people who run these attacks probably spend millions on doing it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:31:42
Well it does have a history of a couple pump and dumps you can see in it's chart and that's about it really, but yeah if they can survive another year than they have a chance of co-existing.Bitcoin has many years of history and the beautiful part of it is how bitcoin surpassed all of it and changed the game for every other crypto. Everyone has to appreciate bitcoin for making this possible. Bitcoin is the only reason the world is even looking at crypto's and this type of history is very strong.

yes the IRS do watch bitcoin holders and movers, Probably the bigger guys. IRS still sees bitcoin as an asset so you pay capital gains on what you sell. Maybe eventually it'll start recognizing it as a currency. That's why I hold. But I always wonder, what if you just go somewhere like another country where they don't tax it just to sell it and come back
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:44:25
of course I buy bitcoin in exchanges lol. I just have a pretty big passion for bitcoin and would love to mine it. I guess I could try it for other currencies and then convert to btc, I guess that would be like the same thing 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:57:43
If I'm correct, doesn't GDAX work with coinbase? I could of sworn I heard they have nearly zero fees
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:18:52
This can be a DDOS attack on their website if I'm correct.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:59:40
I don't think it's a tough road at all. As you say people would cash out for exta money for the holidays, it's also the opposite, People get huge bonuses for the holidays (I do so i hope it does drop a bit so i can buy in) So this may bring even more buyers especially since CME is coming along right before the holidays. Once 8k is broken, 9k will be a piece of cake when 10k is the next step.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:30:19
unfortuntely that's what comes with reddit I believe. I bet a lot of these memes are from people who don't even own any bitcoin, they're just here for 'entertainment'. Since bitcoin is sort of trending, there will be a ton of empty heads running around
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:08:54
I actually agree with everything you said, I do believe december will be a bit slow only because many people will be spectating instead of diving right into it to make sure it's stable at this high price. I think december will hit 9k and possibly 10k around christmas time or in janurary. and 2018 is gonna be an exciting crazy game changing year.

I'd give him more credit than that, he's a good coder and a hacker in general.

Once I noticed they literally have a "Troll chat box" it's an obvious red flag. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:49:47
any quick answers mates?
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:11:33
Authorities are no where near Satoshi's level. In fact most white/black hackers who are advanced are on higher tech levels than pretty much all governments. In fact many of them can hack into government data base's
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:14:53
No, I corrected what you did say. You did not lose 6k holding. you lost 6k selling.
@_date: 2017-09-23 06:48:53
it can't drop to 500 because the amount of people that would buy in even at 1k would be massive which would spike the price up right away
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:38:47
I don't understand the logic behind BCH. Isn't BCH's future depending on bitcoins failure? If that's true than that alone speaks for it's self that it's meaningless, it's just an alt coin.

Did not expect someone in this community to pick up on that! Good shit. Real recognize real.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:47:45
awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-24 04:58:07
LOL this is awesome. how do you get the barcode to that size? 
Imagine we all did this at any big event. I'm pretty interested in doing this myself. You're a great inspiration OP. I can totally do it on the news channel's in NYC. They operate in the city and if you know where, you can just plop yourself right behind them with your signs 
@_date: 2017-09-23 06:12:51
what is it that you say
@_date: 2017-09-22 04:08:12
Sounds like some kind of jim jones cult 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:01:42
this was very informative, thanks mate. I honestly don't know much about this at all but I always loved computers and I enjoy this kind of stuff so I really want to get into the mining bitcoins. Can this be done without occupying a lot of space? I live in a small apartment. Also where do you suggest I go looking for help on this? And by help, I'm talking about starters help on how to build a rig specifically to mine bitcoin, I have no knowledge on this so I would need someone to pretty much give me an exact list of all the things I need to buy. I can manage putting it together because I can do research on that but if there's a simple list of all the things I need to buy to get started that would be a help. I won't use my laptop, I figure what you mentioned(setting up a rig) will make more sense.  (Also I do plan on only mining bitcoin because it's the only coin I support, but realistically if there's a pretty hefty profit to be made switching around I would go for it, but if it's not a big difference than I'm happy with just mining bitcoins
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:13:59
damn man, the joint im smoking right now is for you. This is to much sadness. I've been seeing a lot of stories like this. That's how bitcoin disciplines people though into self security where only you have the private key. That's why it's called private (;

"Pay no attention to the FUD about this GREAT wallet because number's don't lie: hundreds of thousands of active users &amp; ZERO wallets hacked" and guess what, shit rappers go platinum, does that mean they're GREAT? no, it means a million people are stupid as fuck.
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:59:32
They're morons. The money will always be where the majority of users are. They have no choice but to follow us because we won't follow them. We are the people. And we the people only stand for our real coin. Bitcoin core. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:47:34
would that be able to hook on a gaming laptop with the CPU intel core i7-6700HQ 2.60GHz and 1 tb ?
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:25:40
You're literally comparing this -"The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the 28 member states of the European Union" to something that's worldwide. How does that make any sense to compare something that's based in only one zone? So of course time has a lot to do with it, we are talking about a WORLD WIDE currency. This shit will logically take time to develop and adapt hence the fact it's so often called future technology because it's always been so advanced and people are just starting to get the grip of this blockchain technology 
@_date: 2017-09-22 03:58:22
Common sense, others will take advantage by taking their place in mining.  There is no actual loss overall.
@_date: 2017-09-23 06:38:09
how does day trading work? can you actually buy and sell the coins instantly in order to make profits from the contstant hundred dollar jumps? most exchanges I've seen seem to be impossible to day trade due to all the long waiting times.
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:53:01
For real! I bet we all have that friend who talks his shit just because they read a FUD article. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:40:47
yes. Using my gaming laptop at home on my home network behind a router. The router is in the apartment next door, so I wouldn't be able to physically access the router at this moment. Is it necessary to physically access the router?
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:08:40
I look at segwit the same as the first fork. Which bitcoin destroyed and sky rocketed right after.
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:29:20
Watch as investors realize how beautiful bitcoin is and how fun it actually can be trading, they're gonna tell all their buddies on wall street and we might end up seeing a lot of millionaires  joining the bitcoin club.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:09:13
get 2 coins. spend a lot of time on learning about bitcoin and eventually gradually put in more
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:37:34
at 2800 I was waiting for the right price and ended up buying at 3200. There really is no right price because it will keep going up
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:11:19
OP of the sign made a post about it
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:13:25
only reason I don't want to sell is because of taxes, ill hodl till they start recognizing it as a currency.
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:07:43
I've noticed this since we were at 280k subsribers.

I would love to see him debate with that guy from youtube, forgot his name. Starts with an A , almost looks like a dinosuar name I think lol
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:48:04
overall okay but for large amounts of money not worth it because of the 10% fee! In the future I imagine these fees would lower drastically when bitcoin is considered less volatile
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:07:36
and what if I have it stored in a hardware wallet such as ledger ?
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:36:43
That's interesting. I've heard of bitpay but didn't know that's what it does. I'm surprised these companies haven't made any deals with more big chains. Perhaps that's something a new company can capitalize on or they can keep growing i suppose
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:53:55
isn't it also possible for the market to continuously get manipulated as far as bitcoin reaching 500k+ a coin? I think your comment is a little bias because there's a decent amount of whales already, with bitcoin continuing to get a lot of attention many more whales will eventually join while the guppies rapidly join and so on. Basically like every other currency in our economy. You're just assuming that these whales aren't going to swim long enough for bitcoin to become powerful enough to survive. 
And by the way is there anyone that traces those addresses? to see how many are actually active 
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:19:20
Time has everything to do with it. The Euro is a european based currency so I have no idea why you'd even mention that when it's not spendable all over the entire world. In most of all cases you would have to convert it, therefor it's not a worldwide currency. The closest thing to a worldwide currency is probably the petrodollar.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:51:44
naw chill, dip down to 3k first so we can all buy in and then finish the race against apple
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:07:32
Put it this way, after the first fork, BTC went up... Because it proved to be the real coin. These forks will have little to no effect. These forks are things certain people want to happen because they can profit from it knowing that BTC is the main coin but they still want forks to happen to take advantage of it. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 06:52:51
don't blame holding. You chose to sell at a loss lol.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:10:09
I told my girlfriend im going to do that, But I was a bit worried if I leave it inside the bank that they might think it's something suspicious lol
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:29:44
Yes and that's why he's so great. He knows bitcoin literally down to the core and knows it doesn't need any of these 'public figures'. I think he would accept a challenge just to convert them into supporters but he wouldn't challenge anybody because there's no need to. Man bitcoin might even become a tv show with all its drama it gets lol.
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:17:06
well apple ain't really gonna go up drastically. You have a lot more potential with bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-23 06:28:56
I love it and I think you have a good concept going. it's like you can use your art to define what bitcoin stands for. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:21:54
or every person can control their own currency.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:03:03
Yes the Dino dude ! This man is a bitcoin legend.
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:44:52
What research did you conduct to to see how many business's accept it? Because every other day I see new business's accepting it all over the world. You are referring to the major companies and no shit major companies aren't going to accept it maybe besides some like Microsoft because bitcoin is still very new. Bitcoin is worldwide. I don't think people understand that. Of course it's volatile and will be for some years because the whole world needs to adapt....But right now bitcoin pretty much acts like gold in a more volatile way. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:27:52
This would be great to go trending, if it went trending in the millions, obviously Jamie isn't going to comment on it so it will just make him look bad and make bitcoin even stronger.lol Regardless it doesn't matter just like the china thing didn't matter. Decentralized = unstoppable
