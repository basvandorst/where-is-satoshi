Not trying to be, just saw the constant debates about scaling, segwit2x, etc and thought people should look at it from a different perspective

1 BTC is an insane amount for network fees I don't think you'd be paying that much regardless of the amount you send. Could you clarify what you mean by this?
Someone recently sent 157M in bitcoin and the transaction fee was under $2

You can mine bitcoin but only if you want a poor ROI and want to waste money on a rig that probably will take many years to makes it money back.
Also need to consider electricity costs, most places in North America have outrageous costs for kW usage which makes it impossible to mine.

What if you were never employed to begin with?

I sold my BCash for BTC and never looked back. Now would be a good time considering the price spike but who knows, it might go even higher 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:57:21
Now would probably be a good time to buy seeing as how when bitcoin stabilizes/corrects itself, most ALT coins go up.

If you're buying from an bitcoin ATM they usually charge a convenience fee from 5-15% so if the market rate is around 3800 USD, you would be looking at paying upwards of ~$4300

Didnt we just hit 3k yesterday, this is insane.

I sold my BCH early on for 0.18 BTC and don’t have any regrets despite it climbing on. If you believe it will go up then hodl, if you think it’s already at its peak or near it then sell.

This ban was different from the previous one. This ban only affects ICO's which doesn't directly effect bitcoin per se. While the previous ban was on market regulation. Since most ICO's typically take ethereum, you would expect it to take more of a hit.

Small amount with high risk = alt coins
Small amount with low risk = bitcoin
Of course it's all relative and you could lose all your money from either method but if I were on your shoes I'd put it in some alt coins if you didn't care about losing them.
An alt coin has the potential to go up 10000% (and likewise to virtually zero). Do you research and choose wisely, good luck man.

It's not really feasible as a long term investment anymore. Factoring in energy costs and competition (HUGE factories in China and Iceland with minimal electricity costs and large scale production). It wouldn't really be worth your time

Canada actually has plenty of these (At least anywhere near Toronto) so it's driven down the fees of most of them but still the best rates you can get are around 5% commission which isn't too bad if you factor in the confidentiality and convenience

Got tired of waiting to get verified so I just bought from an ATM at a 5-8% fee rate when it dipped but yeah it sucks missing out on the opportunity to buy low

Looks like he broke his arm reaching for an argument as to why bitcoin is trash...

Dubai and the UAE is one of the fastest growing residential markets... And yes Dubai has clubs and alcohol just in strict places with permits. No reason to bash it, I think it's reasonably priced and they're offering a 15% discount for people who purchase with BTC.
