Bitcoin is another currency. If you were working in England, for example, and someone gave you dollars, you would be pretty pissed. You would have to go to the work of changing it. The same applies for bitcoins...

Done, did I make the cut?

I understand this, but the difficulty of changing BTC into a more widely used currency is the same as a payment in a foreign currency. It is *aimed* to be accepted in all countries, but as it is not yet, this idea is not a good one.

The main chat room can be full with spam some time, so click on "Join Room" and type rbitcoin. (they dont allow special characters) There is a higher chance for a payout when you talk in a group, and spam is avoided.
There are also other rooms, like "Mining", or "Litecoin", anything to suit your needs!

Non referral for those who care.

It would be neat if every farmers market were to have like a BTC to farmers market chips. So the farmers could choose to covert the chips into cash, but we would still be paying in BTC...
