Just suppose...
What if bitcoin seems to average about 7500 USD or so over a very long period, like a year or even more.  Currently, this isn't high enough of a value in USD to really mine anymore with GPU's, if mining for profit in USD anyways.  I do not mine with ASIC miners and I really know very little about them, even though I almost bought a Bitmain Antiminer S9 before I build my 8 GPU rig.
Will mining taper off to little to nothing, will difficulty levels be adjusted to compensate miners, or what else?
I would be interested to know some thinking on this, should it become a reality or even close to a reality for some length of time.

I have a question...
Bitcoin has dropped about 6% or so today, yet my 3 mining rigs are still bringing in the same dollar value for the bitcoin they are using - How is this possible?  The bitcoin balance is correct with the actual dollar value currently.  Strange.  It's like my mining rigs picked up speed or something.
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:06:18
This little spike has brought me up to $1.00 a day.  Keep it coming and I'll keep my bitcoin mining... Well, I most likely keep it mining on my dedicated 8 GPU miner at least as it is very inexpensive to run anyway and does about 220+ MH/s for 700 watts.

One of my other hobbies (of which there are many) is prospecting for gold.  Here in Colorado it is not hard at all to find.  Finding enough for the trouble you go through is the tricky part.  I think this must be why I am having fun with mining, HA!  I have about 10K in gold prospecting equipment, and a about 2.5K in dedicated crypto mining equipment.  In both cases, the fun is always worth the bucks.

@_date: 2018-09-09 18:12:01
My rig has value outside of mining.  Investment of cash has no value outside of bitcoin.  There is a significant difference in risk in that philosophy.  Also, I do computers, have for over 30 years now.  Old hat.  Bitcoin mining is new and fun.  New hat.  Significant difference there as well.  Truth is, if bitcoin goes up, all of this is moot as I will get a return either way.  If it goes down to near nothing, better to have the hardware, then spent money that will not come back at all.  Hope you understand.

Been getting bitcoin core setup since yesterday.  All of this is really very new and interesting.  Built my first miner about a month back.  Really appreciate all that goes into all of this tech and aside from not making almost anything for all this work, it been fun for me.  Hope learn more as I go and I figured I would look at any advantages to having my own full node running on another machine full time.  Thanks for all the efforts by so many to get this blockchain and bitcoin available to anyone who wishes to make use of it.  Brings a very independent outlook to monetary resources and a great feat in finding security across the internet for seamless transfers of bitcoin without using a middle man to conflict interests and security.

This letter reads like a company looking for greater market share to me.  Admittedly, I do not follow inner workings of bitcoin, only convert my GPU crypto mining to bitcoin, but pretty much of life has shown me when anyone/any company is pressing for change, it's because they want a bigger piece of the pie.  How is this any different?  Don't really think it is any different.

I see the problem with this bitcoin.  It isn't based on anything at all, nor does it produce anything at all.  It is simply a way to gamble, that's it.  The blockchain it rides upon is something very good and very useful as it provides a medium of safety, security, and even honesty in it's openness to the the world, yet it's security virtually unbreakable because of its openness to all.  I would like to see a way for cryptocurrency to be more than a way to gamble away real dollars for a chance to make more real dollars using bitcoin as the gambling chip it is today.  I think it is much more valuable to the world then that, if somehow we could understand a way for it rise above this virtual token gambling chip.

Depends how you tune them.  I make about $.80 per day on 175 watts.  I get to keep about 1/2 of that.  The other 1/2 pays for the electric.  Goes up and down a bit with the price of bitcoin, but it's my rule of thumb for my 1080 ti.  I only have one of them, wish I had 8 of them in my mining rig instead of the 8 1060's I bought.  But then again, I would have paid almost 3 times as much for the GPU's if I had gone that way.

I've been mining for just over a month now and I have had a problem with coinbase.  Setup my account as requested.  Verified by coinbase for ACH transfers into my account.  First time I used it to buy some bitcoin everything went fine, until about 3 days later when I got an email from coinbase tell me my bank didn't transfer the requested funds requested by coinbase, so my purchase was taken back and I owed a charge now.  Turns out, my bank will not ACH transfer funds to coinbase.  Somehow this became my fault and I was charged for it.  I cannot control a bank anymore then coinbase can.  I did what was requested of me to do.  Coinbase did the verification(s) they chose to do and they only requested me to verify the amount of 2 small deposits they ACH transferred into my account.  
Here's the thing. Turns out this bank does not do outbound ACH transfers, only incoming.  Obviously, I knew nothing about this.  Seems the logical approach to this whole thing would have been for coinbase to not only do a test ACH transfer into my bank account, but should have also done a ACH withdrawal of those funds back to them.  You know, the 2-way street idea.  They didn't, and somehow still feel they did due diligence in testing this service, even though they had to have no idea if they could withdraw from my account, only that they could deposit into it, by the test they did.  
Still not resolved and I have no plans on paying for their mistake.  Big companies do whatever they want.  Banks do and so does coinbase.  It's the little guys that have to pay for all of it, right or wrong.

Looking for better ways to mine without so much taken in fees.  New to the game, but building rigs, with 9 GPU running at this point.

Land, they don't make it anymore.  Bitcoin, they make it, but always harder, always more costly, all the way to the end.  The real question I have is, when will it be too tough for the little man to mine and when will it be too expensive to hold on to, or too worthless to get rid of?  Just into mining and having a great time, but it's a costly time for sure.  My hope is, this hobby will turn into a bit of income, more than a few bucks a day worth of bitcoin.

Been running my 3 rigs off and on as I build them and refine them, but for the past couple days, I am making $70 - $75 per month over cost of electric ($.10 KW).  It's a hobby right now (I have many hobbies as I am retired), so although I'd like to make some "real" money, earning BTC is interesting to me. If I can reduce the fees, I will see more of what I'm earning, which is the reason for my questions.

It's a ride, even if you don't like the rollercoaster aspect to it.  Some people have never set foot on a rollercoaster, ever.  At least most of us talking about it here, are experiencing it first hand.  When I use to gamble, I would tell myself don't bet more than you can afford to lose.  I am not to good at listening to myself most of the time.  This is why I have not literally gambled (or played the stock market, or even bought bitcoin) for over 45 years.  I do have hobbies, my newest ones are various forms of prospecting, mining bitcoin is one of those.

Seems you have a gripe and want to take it out on someone here.  If you don't think it's time to be running a miner, don't.  Me, I think making bitcoin now makes perfect sense no matter the current price.  I never had plans to use my bitcoin, just hold it until I feel it's time to cash it in.  How is anything any different just because the price is low right now.  If you feel bitcoin is about to fizzle, why are you even here?  Just sell everything bitcoin you have and do other things with your life.  Enjoy life, I try to.

During my service years when I was a kid, I gambled so much, I was starving or begging for food.  On seperate rations, I lived on a 50 lb bag of potato and pink grapefruit from trees in the backyard where I lived.  Had to stretch it out for 1 month with that and pocket change and that's it.  That sort of thing (because of gambling ) went off and on for about a 1-1/2 years while I was still trying to grow up and serve Uncle Sam at the same time.  When I made up my mind to quit gambling 100%, I did just that.  Almost 50 years now and never have gambled, not even quarter holes playing golf with buddies.  The only way to leave behind what you never want to take along again, is to cut it clean and never look back.
So now everyone knows why I don't play the stock market, buy those lottery tickets, bet on sure things, or unsure things anytime or anyplace, ever.  What I do is spend money to make money.  Much safer and I am good at knowing what to spend it on most of the time now that I am not "led astray" with that gambling fever I had a near terminal case of back then.

I have lots to learn on terminology I suppose, but NiceHash is calling it a wallet, so I figured I would too.  Just got my first payout for 3 days of mining with my video editing PC.  Ranging from about 2.0 to 5 dollars a day mining.  Pretty seriously considering building a nice mining rig as we are most likely going to solar panels here at the house and electric will be more affordable with that.  The way this payout worked, I figured I cleared almost 1/2 as I know my watt consumption pretty close over the period of mining and what I pay for electric of course.  I'll know near exactly the the profits over this next pay period as I am just going to let it run uninterrupted.  Reminds me alot of when I started with personal computers back in the 70's.  Everything was so new and interesting back then.
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:28:25
New to bitcoin but to me it seems about like the stock market, but with almost no rules, like the wild west days.  But it's also like mining for gold (which I had done quite a lot of), it all depends on how good a spot you have to work and how good your mining equipment is and your talant.  The last thing is, it can be used as a medium of trade for real objects of value.  To me, it seems to make more, not less sense than your typical fiat money all governments use, if only because of less control by governments.
I've been an independent business person for over 40 years, and it is a fun way to play this game of life so far as I have to this point.  I like it and I am just in it when bitcoin is falling.  I think if it does balloon up again (perhaps higher than it's ever been), it will no doubt be more fun, not to mention more profitable.
@_date: 2018-08-17 22:16:15
So are you talking about hardware wallet, or something online, or on my computer?  I have to transfer from any account I've setup on mining software, at least I did on the two I have tried so far.  It wasn't much at Honeyminer, but I have not checked what it will be at NiceHash yet.  Lots to learn yet, but I will.  I was thinking of buying a hardware wallet, but figured I'd wait until I actually have enough money to bother with.
Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 18:15:22
I'd say it's already falling.  Good indicator to me is what is happening my miners on NiceHash.  I am making about 60% lower bitcoin right now at about 12 noon, then I was around 5am this morning.

Precious metals are the only "real" standard that should be counted.  Everything else is made up and manipulated in some way.  You cannot make precious metals, they must be mined to become "real" and not imaginary.  This is the real problem in this world today, as there isn't any longer any currency based on what is real, what cannot be made up.  Bitcoin, even though mined, is still a made up product, not something real and of intrinsic value, that can be held in a hand, or stored in a vault.  This is why bitcoin is bobbing up and down like a cork in the ocean.  Whatever (whoever) splashes the water hard enough, raises or lowers the level of that cork and everyone placing value upon it, sees more or sees less value in it.  Even though precious metals are traded, they can never be devalued lower then those holding them will allow it to go.  All they need to do is hold and not sell and the value will rise again.  Real value, real existence cannot evaporate into thin air or be "worth less the the paper they are printed on".

I think you have a problem with people who look out for themselves, and give others the thought to do the same.  As to how the IRS can do things, any things, they can do them because the have been give autonomous power and authority outside our constitution by our law makers breaking constitutional law by charging them to do the work of congress.  Our government gets to do whatever it pleases to do, and that is all there is to that.  The minions only get to fuss about it at best.  If you choose to trust someone with what you value, you would be wise to be very careful who that someone is.

New to mining and newer to bitcoin core.  I have it because I wanted a secure hardware wallet I could call my own, not tied to a someone else's purse strings.  Now, I have to admit I am a full novice in just about all of this, so a bit of slack would be appreciated.  If I understand bitcoin core at all, I understand it to be a compilation of nodes that together form the backbone of all things bitcoin.  If I am not to very far off, one might say to provide a bitcoin core node, is to provide the most necessary part bitcoin must have to exist.  Again if close, I am curious enough to ask, if this is the  priority for bitcoin to exist, how is it not at least as important as mining bitcoin?  Would it not be impossible to do one without the other?  
I make just a bit of money mining a couple 3 rigs right now.  One dedicated and 2 are desktop computers with added GPU's.  I all, just 11 GPUs mining.  I am seeing about $100 to $150 a month come in and I see about 3/5ths of it go out to the electric company.  Not complaining, as for me it is fun and new.  But I have to try hard to understand why it is I am not going to make any money providing all of the hardware, electric, and internet fees to run a bitcoin core full node.  Seems off to me and I have to ask why it is this way.  
I appreciate some reasonable answers to this, if anyone really knows why.
Thanks.

I believe it is winding down.  Couple things show this.  One - Since the boon last December, it has been on a downward trend (look at the chart).  Two - Mining isn't really any good any more, just robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Three - The bitcoin left to mine is all that is left period -- What then?
I see maybe a year or so left for bitcoin.  Over that year, there will no doubt be some very wild times as people begin to realize bitcoin isn't going to last much longer.

The term "hodl" is interesting to me.  Based on what I have read, it came about when someone misspelled "holding" as hodling.  What is interesting is, most people who do not believe in "hodling" think it's a mistake to hold coin and it is better to sell high, buy low, or just sell.  I guess then, those who do believe in hodling, must also believe two "wrongs" do make a "right", in some way, at least some of the time.

I feel good when I am able to do things new and different.  Even better when I can do them and not break something.  For me, mining right now is making about $125 to $150 a month.

Reformed gambler here of over 40 years now.  I don't gamble, just have fun mining and thinking of ways to do better with what I have invested.  Putting out dollars for me would be gambling and when I stopped that, I made a promise to never bet a penny on anything that is directly gambling.  Now, not everyone sees things like me (thank God), but in life I have found the only way to get rid of something is to throw it away and never look back or pick it up again. 
I have been involved in real mining for over 15 years and crypto mining for just a couple months.  In both, I have been please to invest in equipment to do the work of mining.  It's fun and at my age, it is good work to keep me interested and learning things new.

At best, bitcoin is an experiment.  You cannot sustain any currency simply based on an ideal.  The fact that bitcoin has a built-in limit to the actual number of coins means it is a finite currency that must reach end, or be changed into something else it was never meant to be.  The very ideal of value place on work is not new, but to submit that work can be no more than spending time and money looking for a needle in a haystack is simply a dream.  It must change into reality, not imaginary money built upon an experiment.  Right now, it's a gambling game.  If it were not, it's value would be about nil.  When the gambling reaches a place where those with enough bitcoin can say what is up and what is down by how they move their bitcoin, that game is rigged and smart people will start to walk away.  Close to that now.  If somehow, something could solidify bitcoin value it could live a longer life, but unless somehow stability comes to bitcoin, dollars are going to leave it and people will too.

It's a saying from years back.  It means you are only circulating something, not really gaining anything.  With the super low margins now in mining, if you consider wear and tear at all on your equipment, the dollar value left over after paying electric will not pay for the equipment before the equipment needs to be worked on or replaced.  The hope every miner has it the value of their coin will increase so that there actually is profit at some point.  I believe it will, but I also believe with the difficulty level steadily increasing in mining, more and more miners will stop mining.  Incentives is what keeps people trying.  If incentive is to hard to find, trying will also be too hard to do.

Yes.  My intent on mining was to acquire bitcoin at first, but considering the likelihood of bitcoin even doubling in price, though unlikely, would still only double what I have.  Seemed more advantageous to find a lower priced coin to mine that had a very good likelihood of multiplying at least 10 times or more the current value.  That lead me to doing research while I let NiceHash mine what IT thought was good to mine.  Took a couple months, but I firmly believe Ravencoin IS THAT COIN.  So, yes, I am a hodler for sure.  But only Ravencoin.

I have 36 GPU's in 3 rigs that go into my home theater area in the basement at winter time.  Our furnace never goes on. I mine a coin that mines fine the the GPU's tuned down.  About zero fan noise as there are 36 quiet fans that augment the GPU fans, so they only run at 70% power. Making coin, making profit, and no charge for heating my home.  I like it better then on and off heat, everything is always the same temps and does not dry the air either.
@_date: 2019-12-19 18:59:00
Guess I missed a few questions...
Electric - I use right around 3000 Watts of power, or 2160 kWh.  Cost for electric here is $0.10 per kWh.  Makes that into $250.00 including mining fees and tax in all.  Mining makes me anywhere from $300 to $400 (based on coin price) a month.  That leaves a profit of $50 to $150 per month.  I mentioned I do not sell coin, only trade for added profit.
House - Not large, about 2000 sf.  Basement, main and 2nd floor.  Well insulated as it is in higher elevation and it does get cold and snowy in the winter months. Temps stay about 65° to 69° F. in the main level.  Basement is more like 75° and upstairs close to main level, bit colder at night however as we all sleep with windows cracked open a bit.
Heating - Normal heating is natural gas.  Gas bill would usually be $30 to $50 per month.  Cheapest bill we have. But with the miners running 24/7 in the basement, that heat climbs up the stairs and fills the house with enough heat that the thermostat setting of 64° keeps the furnace from coming on.  If the temps outside get below 0° or colder, I would imagine the heater will turn on, but so fare this winter the coldest has be 7°.  Most days hit around 30° or so.  I have had to open my sauna door in the basement bathroom and the window in the sauna a few times when it gets too hot.  Works better, all in all, then I thought it would when I put the miners down there a month or so ago.  I believe since the "heater" is never off with miners being the heaters, everything absorbs some of the heat and there is an ambient amount of heat stored in everything, making a much more uniform heat, sort of radiant in fact.  A normal furnace turns off and on base on temperature change, so there is always a fluctuation to deal with using normal heating systems. I believe that makes things heat up and cool down some, which we feel as a change in temperatures, and we then need to adjust to it as well. I know everyone in the house prefers this "miner heater", over the normal furnace heater.

Well, I am not a BTC holder per say.  RVN is my main coin.  I do have others, including BTC, but not nearly as much. I think it will be fine because I do watch the market on RVN and BTC.  The other coins are just coins I have also mined and held. Since I have both RVN and BTC in hand, up or down market on either usually works just fine. If they both go up, good.  If they both go down bad.  That's part of the game of holding any crypto I suppose.
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:49:27
Ruffling feathers here is not my desire.  But, I do value truth above all else.  To somehow think something "electric" in nature can last forever, really shows limited understand of things. If, and only if, BTC became something you could hold in your hand, would it be something to place your full trust in.  And then, it had better be made out of something that is  of inherent value on its own, like gold.

No I am not.  But all I do is trade RVN/BTC, nothing else.  Set a buy number and sell number on RVN and I keep getting more and more. I am a miner, not a trader, but it is just too easy to see extra profit doing this.  Everyone has heard, "buy low, sell high".  It isn't any harder then that. If you can muster up a bit of finesse you can get your trades more often, but I just shoot a safe amount low, and buy RVN back at it's normal high point.  Usually a spread of 10 to 12 satoshi.  I trade quite a bit of RVN at a time though, so each trade gets me a couple hundred bucks or so.  Once a week a trade comes in if I'm lucky.  Has been over a month a time or 2 though.  Set it and forget it, no bots.  Seems to work OK for me.

No, only because if there is a worldwide financial crash, infrastructure will also crash which means no internet. At that point, electronic currency of any type will not be anymore.  Gold is forever as long as you have a method to protect it from others/government taking it.
On a side note, gold comes from burned out suns.  There will always be a scarcity of it, which is the primary reason it is valuable. 
I am a miner of crypto and believe in it's value, but gold is king in my book.

There is money to be made if you do some manual trading, up and down.  I piddle with it as I am a miner of a different coin and trade that to BTC and back again.  I made quite a bit of profit and I believe in both the coins greatly, so I have zero fear where I am when either shoots up, or shoots down.  Profit comes both ways you know.

I believe in its intended purpose as an inexpensive way to transfer assets to ownership legally without any middlemen unless desired. Providing all the means necessary, built into it's asset layer. There is too much to type to list all the ways this can be used, but Ravencoin has been built from the beginning for it's purpose and it has all been done fairly without anyone owning any portion of it over anyone else. If you are interested, you should take the time to do a couple of searches on the internet.  If you really do not know what Ravencoin is or is about, you will be surprised I am pretty sure.

I did itemize in my larger post just above about this, but basically I spend $250 per month on electric and mine from $300 to $400 a month.  I do not get bitcoin at all until I trade.  I trade up and down BTC and the coin I mine.
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:43:31

Must have hit a nerve.  Lots of response here to this so I guess I should elaborate a bit.
I have been mining for over 1-1/2 years now.  Started as small as you can, 1 gpu.  Retired, so I have time and I enjoyed mining crypto as I come from mining real gold for the past 15 years or so.  Don't do much real mining anymore as it is just too cold in the waters now for me.  Still have the dredging equipment, and my son does use it on occasion.  Over the past year and a half I have added GPU's monthly as I felt like spending more money.  Most of them came on pretty quick and I have always earned profit, sometimes more, sometimes less.  The equipment costs has been returned in coin profits and although I have never cashed in a coin, only traded for others, I feel I have my return made and have for some time.
As to the coin I like to mine most of the time, I'll just say that it uses the X16R family of algos mostly.  They mine the best using nVidia, which all of my GPUs are.  Underclocking lowers the electric usage, and most of the time they use about 70 watts per card.  I have recently upped the power settings to 80 watts per card as I seem to have a good amount of hash and profits are just a bit greater overall.  I have recently begun mining with a partner, my oldest nephew.  He has just about exactly the same hashrate as I do, so we are now mining with 1 Gh/s on 11 rigs in total.  We are both retired, so we are having much fun and of course we get to nag and kid each other all the time which is also great fun!
Hope this gives a bit of a better understanding on what I am about these days.  Good luck to all of you and keep believing in crypto as I do believe it will be the currency of the future.

The government should not be allowed to make or print money.  It should be the responsibility of people themselves as to what constitutes value, how much, and what token represents that value.

Got a response from Bitsy and this is being elevated to their engineering people.  I'd think it should go to security, but perhaps they are one in the same.  Emailed 2 images.  One of my debit card bank holding funds and the other showing the transaction was completed 2 days later.
For those wondering...
This was a debit card purchase on an AMEX card.  It should be an instant transaction as far as the CC processor is concerned.  Bitcoin blockchain transfer of course depends on some different factors, but still, enough time has gone by for any normal transfer on the blockchain to have been completed.  Besides, the Bitsy app itself never gave me any transaction process notifications at all, so something is really screwy.

So, if you cannot use your bitcoin where you are, you are happy that others can in the places they are?  How will this help you?  I prefer to believe in reality anyway.  The reality is, if any government does not want bitcoin in there country, the most honest answer I know is, bitcoin will not be in that country, at least not in any useful measure. If the country has no ability to control its people, then I would suspect there isn't any rule it can really enforce anyway.  And, I would hope for better things to come from bitcoin too.  If people think one thing is more valuable than everything, I have to wonder about their general state of mind to begin with.

"Bitcoin &amp; Cryptocurrencies will never be able to be the main Currency. Here's why."
Governments must be in charge of your life and all that is in it.  That's how governments work.  At any point where something becomes a problem for government, the problem will find it harder and harder to exist until it is only a memory one day.  Crypto is that problem starting and before too long it will targeted and worked on by governments world-wide.  Until that happens, make as much as you can and when you have enough, put it into things that the government gets little bites of on a regular bases.  Governments like taking their share and will let things exist that allow it to have it's piece of the pie.

I think the idea is, not using FIAT money, but cryptocurrency for necessary purchases and selling of goods, cuts the banking/government entities out of the transaction loop so to speak.  In doing that, it becomes more of a personal agreement between 2 parties, with a token offered and accepted as the proof of acceptance between these 2 parties.  Multiply that by a few 100 million a day, or billions, or more, and you see the banks and government are out of the loop a whole bunch.  The question here is, when most of what civilized man does in this venue of trading tokens, not FIAT money for goods and services, will banks and governments survive without the business they once had.  I personally believe the time is past for FIAT and government/reserve/banks issuing FIAT money.  It's time the people themselves take over this job.  After all, what better way could "WE THE PEOPLE" be expressed then taking back their lives and existence without a "BIG BROTHER" watching over their every move they make.

A number of these statements are not technically correct -- The largest being that governments can't stop bitcoin transactions.

Unless the people themselves stop their government somehow, their government will control them and their treasures to the extent they choose to.

Traded all my bitcoin for Ravencoin when it was at 1.3 cents and bitcoin was 6400 USD.  Since then, I have bought back bitcoin 3 times in the range of 3700 USD or so.  Have more bitcoin now by a bit more than 2x then when I sold and have close to the same amount of USD invested.  I'll just let it set now most likely and keep mining my 10K of Ravencoin per month at the current difficulty levels.  Hope Ravencoin doesn't go up too high too fast so I can keep getting this amount per month or so, but I am afraid it most likely will go up faster now. I like mining more than I like trading, less risk.

The rapid and unyielding swings up and down of crypto coins are a huge part to the problem with any trade not base on an intrinsic object, only an imaginary one.  The fear is, when all is said and done, to be left holding a bunch of air, is a very likely possibility.  
Ravencoin is moving out of this position with the Assets function coming in.  Once usable as a absolutely secure transvience device for any number different types of assets, token base, or otherwise, the value of Ravencoin will become the value it holds for everyone who owns such assets.  That value is real in many cases.  Something of substance, solidity, reality.  Whole different ball game soon coming.

Bit off on the ARPANET date I believe.  I was a techcontroller in the USAF at Strike Command, MacDill AFB from 1970-1973.  Prior to that, I was 14 months in training at Keesler AFB, Biloxi MS, and I remember in one of my classes we were talking/learning about the early ARPA work in this area through a few universities that comprised the first nodes of this pre-internet we have today.  The TCP-IP protocols were around when I was stationed at MacDill in the early 70's.  We had circuits that ran from the pentagon, strike command, NORAD and some others that used this protocol.

Only if and when any crypto reaches some very reasonable degree of reliable stability will anything close to adoption take hold.  As someone who understands the reality of what "feast or famine" really means over generations, I can honestly tell you there are very few that would willingly adopt any lifestyle that offers this as a better substitute than fiat money.  The only ligidament way I see this happening is if it is forced upon us at a last resort to hold an economy from falling to pieces all together, or if stability comes along with it .
The best way to stabilize anything is to have enough hands on it, using it, building upon it, developing it, and moving with it.  That is adoption.  So, even though it means having adoption is the only way to achieve adoption, it isn't an oxymoron.  What it means is, there has to be somethings inherent in it, to almost force one to want it, or even better, require it for some better purpose that only it can offer.
400 of the designers of bitcoin understood this and did something about it.  Rather than me trying to explain this, I will present you with a couple of links, so you can look and see, if you can see the reasoning behind this.  It's real, not fake and it is the future of crypto as I and very many see it.  Crypto has to prove it is indispensable, fully usable and workable like nothing else.  It can be, and it will be, but it must be built for that purpose, from the ground up.  Please take the time to look and try hard to understand what it means to be worthy of success in transforming this worlds belief in a government, any government, controlling our destiny by controlling our money supply, into a belief that each one of us has a right to decide it is we, ourselves, who MUST BE in control of each of our destinies -- Here's a clue, it is not government, not any government and they can only be the antithesis to our own power of control over our own lives.
Please, take the time to read and understand what this can mean.  It is up to each one of us to decide the truth, the real truth.

My Ravencoin is forked from Bitcoin and it follows right along with it, up or down.  I am at the threshold of mining for profit vs mining in the negative (spending more for electric then the value of the coin), mining RVN.  I will keep mining though as I am up to tremendous amounts of coin per day and I fully believe Bitcoin will come back, and so I believe Ravencoin with too.  In fact, I may need to adjust my threshold a bit as with more coin coming in, even if less valued, the numbers might make up the shortfall.

As it is, all crypto is to volatile to replace fiat money.  People living paycheck to paycheck simply cannot afford to have their earnings fluctuate so dramatically.  The only way any universal currency could take hold is if stability were insured by some unbreakable means.
Perhaps if there were no fiat money, just crypto, it may have a better chance, but still far too much to gamble this world's economy on.  Crypto has to prove to the world it is viable and that means stable and unshakable.

I've been crooked by them for a faulty system of approval they use.  My bankcard didn't honor their request for an ACH transfer to them on a bitcoin purchase.  Nothing I did wrong, just the bank would not send to them.  They presupposed that by putting 2 small payments in my bank, and me identifying the amounts, they were good for ACH transfers.  Problem was, this particular bankcard only allows incoming ACH transfers, not outgoing ones (or at least to them).  So, they take back my bitcoin and charge me the difference in the bitcoin value over the 4 days or so before they found out they were not paid for the purchase.  The bitcoin never went anyplace either, it just had my name on it, mine not theirs, so they figure I should pay the imaginary loss they incurred because of their sloppy approval system.
To me, that spells crooks, with a capital "C".

And so you see the dilemma of all crypto that isn't based on something of intrinsic value.  It blows with whatever way the wind blows.  The wind is the buyers and sellers in the marketplace.  The big blowhards decide which way to blow and everyone holds their hats (hodls their hat if you like), or the hat blows off and falls down a steep or even straight down cliff.  
Just imagine if the value of real property were so fragile.  Not too hard to remember either, back in '08 when the house bubble burst.  That was caused by crooks in high places in our federal government allowing selling of housing loans that had no business being sold to people who had no way to pay them back.  So, it can happen to things of intrinsic value to, but nothing like it happens cryptocurrency all of the time it seems.   
I do not choose to play this game the way most do.  All I do is keep mining my chosen coin with the hope that one day it will go up in value.  Hoping it goes up high enough were I can start to cash it in and buy things like real property as I believe that is the safest place to put extra earnings if it is possible to.

There is nothing magic in any crypto, just hope and if your smart and/or lucky, rewards.  Trick is, "You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em", as Kenny Rogers use to sing.

They are crooks, from the getgo and will be until shutdown.

Not me, but I mine RVN and have no ASIC or FPGA to battle against.  400 to 500 coin every day and still making some profit, even at these low coin prices.  I just hold anyway, so I keep mining no matter what the coin price is.  I mine for the future value of my coins, not present value.

Nope.  And I have 2 VR systems too.  Grandkids love to play games, especially VR, so I make a space for that to happen when they come over.

Your just kidding when you say "In investing there is no, i repeat no, place for emotions", right?  All investing is wrapped up with is emotions.

Well I suppose like most things in life, it's best to keep things you value away from those who would obscound with them.

It would do well if other coins stabilized while the bitcoin(s) fight it out to the bitter end.  But regardless of that, when the fighting is all over and a bitcoin is named the winner, maybe some amount of peace could return to crypto.  Nothing deals well with destabilization very well, people especially.

The governments of the world must survive and to do that they must control.  Owning all the money in the world by virtue of printing all of it, taxing all of it, and all of everything else, gives them that absolute control they need and more.  Right now, crypto is a toy the government (those in power over it) allows it's people (servents) to play with to occupy their excess time and give them a little pleasure and a vision of what could be, or might be one day.  When that toy of pleasure becomes a weapon to be used against it, every government will do everything they can  and need to, to stop it.  That will be the death of crypto and most likely the death of a lot of things, including many of us who dream of better things to come by less government and less controls from government.  Interesting times for sure.
