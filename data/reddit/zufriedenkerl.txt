Click on the "Paper Wallet" tab, in the green box, top row, 2nd from the right.
You can generate and print out your own paper wallets.

My younger brother said he just wanted "cash" for his 16th birthday, might as well use this as an excuse to introduce Bitcoin to another person! Hopefully he'll like it once I explain how it works to him tomorrow. Figured that this was worth sharing to you guys.

She pledges support for transparency and decentralization? Those are two of the reasons why I'm voting for anyone BUT her!

I wasn't saying that he was insane, just that the act was insane to comprehend, sorry if I offended you or him, or anyone reading that...

Coinbase responded to you, misleading title.
Hmm, you are rude and completely disregard what he said, then open another chat the next day and curse at him unprovoked. You seem either a. very childish and immature, with no real world experience or b. an actual child.
There is only so much a customer support rep. can do. Additionally, with something like Bitcoin and cryptocurriencies in general, any sort of customer service is a huge luxury. I can't imagine how someone like *you* would react back in the day when funds were taking a while to go through. Nevertheless, I fail to see what the problem is, they canceled your order, it normally takes 3-5 days for an ACH transfer to go through, depending on the bank. 
There is no issue here besides you being an inconsiderate, impatient prick. Thus, going to reddit, expecting a hugbox of people circlejerking you off while you whine about how your $50 isn't in your bank instantly. 
Did mommy raise you to be rude and curse at service people when they are doing their job the best they can do? Coinbase is a great company, Bitcoin is an even greater currency, however, people like you should sod off because you being no where near Bitcoin makes things better for everything, and everyone.

I'm speechless. That's actually insane. My brother will be opening this present tonight, I'm a college student and could only afford to give him $30 for a present, that's a lot to me. I didn't even realize that someone would have thought of sending money to the key in the pic... I honestly would have never noticed if I didn't check Reddit this morning. That is a very large amount of money,,especially from a stranger, but it's also the thought and sentiment that counts. That is such an insane thing for you to do! Thank you so much for making my brother's birthday that much better, seriously. I will let him know and hopefully teach him as much as I can, so that he can love Bitcoin as much as we all do here. Thank you again. And thank you to all of you, super unexpected. I am very grateful for everyone. Just wow.
edit- apparently my use of "insane" is coming across as improper to some, I apologize. I am saying it in the best way possible. Was not calling insane in the slightest. However, I am still wrapping my head around the fact that a bunch of anonymous strangers piggybacked my birthday gift to my younger brother. 
I am incredibly grateful and thankful to be part of such a wonderful community, seriously. I will surely pass on the good fortune to others. Thank you all.

When did you order it?

Any particular year for the silver Eagles, or just 2016? I assume they are all minted identical. Normal uncirculated coins?

Thanks for the answer, I guess they suspended some of the colors recently for whatever reason. Black one looked super cool though!

Lol here is another example of ignorance among the people
1,490,000 memebers of all branches in the US military.
1,220,000 law enforcement/peace officers in the US.
318 million citizens in the US.
More than 300 million firearms in the US, in civilian hands.
*Assuming* that even all of the military and police would decide to turn on and start killing their neighbors, friends, families, they would still be so insanely outnumbered it is laughable.
Why on earth do you think all these elite Democrats are scrambling to control guns at any and every chance, because they're *scared* shitless of the population, because we have the power to overthrow the government. They have managed to brainwash people through mass shootings and gun violence that guns are the problem, a great scapegoat to get guns away from the people, the power away from the people.
Anyone who says that "no one would fight the government", "haha LOL, you silly people couldn't beat the ARMY and AIRFORCE, they would just blow you up haha", people who say that are so unbelievably ignorant it honestly scares the shit out of me.
The United States revolution happened ~ 240 years ago, the French Revolution (where they beheaded their "elites" in the streets) was less than that, the Arab Spring, was **5** years ago.
In human history alone that timespan is *nothing*. Those times may seem distant, but they are all too close. You may feel safe and comfortable now in modern civilization, but thinking for some reason that we are now immune to a revolution is just plain **ignorance**.

Maybe you should have done some research into how a business works before you hook up your checking account to it lol? If you want your Bitcoin instantly, go withdraw however much you want from your bank in cash, go to local BTC, and meet some guy at Starbucks or somewhere and buy BTC from him instantly... Otherwise, you get to wait a few days like most people who buy BTC online.
