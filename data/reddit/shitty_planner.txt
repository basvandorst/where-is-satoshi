Use GDAX

It's already got a name. They are called Satochis

That's my birthday! I know what I want this year

Coinbase have really fucked things up. Their freaking charts don't work, they introduced BCH which confused everyone entering the market now, and confidence has taken a huge hit. They have done the entire crypto market a huge disservice.

This happened to me immediately after I deposited $100 from a CC. So I think it's some kind of bonus.

For the record, usually even if a bank transfer takes a week or more to process, it should still be processed at the price when you executed the buy, so the "time sensitive" aspect is somewhat mitigated.

Once you start with GDAX there is no point to using Coinbase any longer.

Poorly designed roundabout though. Entry speeds are way too high. No horizontal deflection.

You're probably right. I think I am biased by my own relatively conservative investing philosophy: Only invest in things I use, or as Buffett puts more eloquently:  "Never invest in a business you cannot understand."

I'm sorry for your financial losses but you need to come to terms with the fact that you may have bought at an all-time high. If it "moons" great, but it could easily vanish in a puff of smoke.

Ohhh...I thought he put his life savings ($850) into it last month...
Totally misread that.

sorry for your losses

One of the worst I've seen. Probably going to save it as an example

It's not a hard set rule by any means. MOU. Memorandum of Understanding. Very common. Stupid argument anyway, the backronym is great.

Snus. Swedish snus. Not the American crap

Right that's true, but relatively rare
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:19:55
Not really. They lose when they sell

Question. Is it pizzaholio or pizzaholic?
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:35:11
Careful with that kind of talk

Okey dokey. Transferred all cash and investment proceeds to coinbase. Done. Next step please.
