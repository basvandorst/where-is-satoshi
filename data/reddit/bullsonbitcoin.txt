Why isn't holding fiat gambling?
PRO TIP: It is.  
I'm not necessarily investing, I'm divesting from the dollar and speculating on the future.  I know how fiat currencies end with irresponsible monetary policy.  
I'm hedging my life in any way possible.  Bitcoin is one of those ways.
I'm not 100% concerned with the fees right now as a result.  Bitcoin has proven to be a flight to safety these past 10 years, at least in the crypto space.   Physical gold has a premium, as does speed in the congested blockchain.  It is secure and trusted globally.  I see no reason it won't continue that trend as inflating &amp; failing fiat currencies continue to fuck their citizens and their purchasing power.
I'm diversifying and divesting from the crony bankster ponzi schemes that effects the majority of all lives.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:31:54
Fiat is the bubble.  They are ever inflating and that paper needs to go somewhere.
Alts are fueled by dumb money, speculation, and dreams of lambos.
Bitcoin is the global most trusted &amp; decentralized secure ledger on the planet.
Billions of people aren't going through all the hassle, verification, KYC laws, fees, etc, etc to buy a fucking coffee.  They are here the evolution and return of sound money dressed up like a get rich quick scheme which is just the natural consequence of the early acquisition of the new trusted global reserve currency known as Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:40:58
No, i agree.  They are not all crap, some are really awesome.  I do feel the majority, if not all, are currently overvalued.  The entire crypto space went crazy these last 6 months and it's pretty terrifying really.  I would have preferred much slower growth.
I do hold a little Monero, Iota, Lisk, etc.  Being a newb I screwed up bad, got blinded by not wanting to see gains erased, and liquidated my cryptos after we broke through the 10k milestone and "popped" off of 11,400.  Needless to say I really didn't get my "correction" that I thought for sure was coming,  and ultimately bought back some BTC, XMR, LTC mostly.  I wrecked my position and now can't afford to buy to all back, but re secured my BTC again and just gonna HODL from here on out.  I always took a long term view 3-5 years+, but let me emotions get the best of me.
I do think we'll see the tide shift again soon and alt money will flow back into bitcoin, but who knows.  Such is crypto.  The entire space feels a little bubbly, but where is that money gonna go when profits get taken.. back into fiat, or back into bitcoin?
I think we'll see a flight to safety... fiat, bitcoin, and strong fundamental and actually used coins like Monero, maybe Steem, etc, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:35:49
Yup, my mistake was thinking I was smart and going full fiat.  Being new (in around $3800) I thought I was going to buy the correction after the 10k milestone and greatly increase my stack.  
Didn't buy the "dip" at $9100 because that was no real correction and my impatience ultimately led me to buying back at 16k.  Now I've got a ton of downside risk and a tax bill coming due.  Such is life... I knew the risks, but some lessons are only learned 1st hand I guess.
I'll continue to accumulate if we see a correction, otherwise I'll wait for these alts to correct and watch BTC rally as people flee back to safety.
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:57:38
Mass civil disobedience.  
Bitcoin is only a tool.  It still requires the people to stand up.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:08:15
Bitcoin doesn't have to.  Fiat replaces itself eventually.  History shows us that they all eventually fail.
Bitcoin will exist along side fiat and hopefully bring honesty and accountability to world finance, but eventually people will most likely see paper for what it is (theft through currency debasement) and will ultimately panic buy anything of real value as their purchasing power is eroded.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:10:37
Tough call.
We might continue to bleed downward.
Or we might be consolidating between 13k-16k before the next leg up.
Lots of FUD, lots of people on the sidelines still trying to get signed up and verified,  ETF's coming.  Alts pumped to insane levels and uncertainty building.  I don't believe BTC runs to nearly 20k and doesn't test it again.  No way.  I think this bull is far from over.
I screwed up and sold at 10k off of the 11.4 "pop" thinking we were in for a correction.  Boy was I wrong.  Wrecked my position and eventually bit the bullet and bought back in.  
MSM and the idiots on TV are still talking bubble this and disaster that.  Bullish.  I'll sell when the mainstream media is encouraging people to buy like they did when the housing market collapsed.  
Best of luck to you.  Remember that fiat is a dangerous game as well.  It's a guaranteed loss of purchasing power over time.  
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:38:06
I'm not talking about transactions and regular day to day use cases (improbable as a result of the tax implications).  I'm talking about it being potentially held by governments and institutions as part of their foreign exchange reserves.
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:39:56
We we're in the foolish business of buying high and selling low I'm waiting for single digits before I do really dumb stuff.  If I'm going to realize a loss might as well make it the biggest loss I can.
The time to sell was $19.7k
Selling as things go lower is just self destructive.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:16:57
I would be.  These exchanges are incompetent fucks.
On the blockchain the transaction was final after a few confirmations.
You need to open a ticket with the exchange I'm guessing.
*edit - whoops,  Are you talking BTC or USD deposit?  I'd give it up to 10-12 days or so before I worry about USD ACH transfer.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:51:07
Bitcoin looks to be starting to be recognized as a global reserve currency.  Countries might start allocating resources into Bitcoin to diversifying against their failing fiat currencies and boost their GDP.
Bitcoin doesn't need to hold hands and honor any "customer",  it's simply becoming an honest and accountable trans international currency.
It's not for coffee anymore.  The transactions fees don't mean shit to the players that are entering this space.  Micropayments will be made on the coming 2nd layers &amp; scaling solutions.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:07:54
Meme makers have had plenty of opportunity to refuel.
Lets get this party started again.  Memes matter.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:59:01
I've found dozens of sellers on craigslist willing to sell their  Caribbean houses, businesses, and hotels for Bitcoin.  Way cheaper, fast, and less complex than dealing with fiat to make these international purchases.
Go buy yourself an ocean view in costa rica.  
Nobody gives a fuck about buying a cup of coffee right now.  Bitcoin works,  big players see it's utility.  Countries are starting to see it's utility.
Micropayments will be solved with 2nd layer solutions.  The immutable secure global trusted ledger that is Bitcoin is popular.  There is demand for the speed on the blockchain... hence the high fees.  Thing is nobody really gives a shit, because they didn't get into bitcoin to buy a hypothetical coffee.    There isn't even a ton of merchant adoption yet.. even when there was low fees... it'll return in time.  Something much larger is unfolding as Bitcoin matures into possibly the 1st trans international trust-less world reserve currency.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:31:52
If you're seeing confirmations on the actual transaction ID when checked on a block explorer than it means it's done and official on the Blockchain.
Some exchanges have a minimum before they'll credit your account, but I wouldn't think they'd be in the hundreds of confirmations required.  It sounds like the exchange is slow and hasn't credited your account, or they've goofed up somehow and lost the deposit. Or you goofed up and sent the coins to a wrong address.
I think you need to contact the exchange if you're seeing that many confirmations on the tx id, and you're still not credited the correct balance in your exchange wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:10:26
Maybe not to secure the loan itself, but they absolutely will look at other assets as proof of reserve funds, etc when required for closing a loan.  Whether they accept it or not is up to the lender I imagine, but I've went through similar with physical gold liquidity/documentation, etc.
If he can prove he has liquid asset in a coinbase account or something they may consider it for proof of reserve funds or something without having to liquidate.  He may have enough USD in a bank account for closing costs and everything, but sometimes they'd like to show more assets to cover 6 months of payments on both properties in case of loss of renter, etc.. in the instance of rental income, debt/credit ratio.
Bitcoin is becoming a legitimate asset class slowly but surely.  
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:48:43
I doubt it.
BTC pulled back off of 20k because it was the 2nd *major* milestone after blowing through 10k.  Bitcoin was $900 a year ago and had made massive moves.  It went parabolic and needed a breather.. profits needed taken off the table for many.
Most people don't care about the fees right now.  Nobody is buying BTC to spend it, it's the truth. The verification, KYC laws, tax liabilities, etc, etc. They're either buying to speculate on the future of crypto currency and the desire for gains, or their buying to hedge against currency controls, fiat debasement, and destructive government monetary policy.
Nearly everyone is sitting in the black still.. even those that bought at 19k are cool if they divested a bit into alts, as they pumped like crazy when BTC pulled back.  BTC made 2000% gains.. some alts made even greater.  Nicely timed trades made millionaires out of average Joe.  Fees are a temporary problem sure, but they don't really mean shit right now. 
Just my 2c.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:12:38
That's not true at all.  
I can move 1 BTC from here to my friend across the world without asking anyone permission or dealing with any central authority.  I can store it in my memory outside of the reach of corrupt government and destructive monetary policy.  Seems like value to me.  
1 BTC = 1 BTC  .  It will always be.
I can attempt to value that in inflating fiat currency,  or I could value that in head of cattle.  I could value it against another crypto - as we see in the crypto space.  Literally the entire alt coin market doesn't value against FIAT - it values against Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's value comes from people's confidence in it - all currencies do.  
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:44:40
I believe bitcoin will mature towards becoming a global reserve currency held in significant quantities by governments and institutions as part of their foreign exchange reserves.  Hopefully it brings some accountability and honesty to the global financial markets.
It's not going to be used for day to day purchases because of the tax implications of spending your coin (regardless of speed or cost).
Until we have 100% private and anonymous ways to spend currency it'll be held as a speculative bet, store of value, or hedge against destructive monetary policy and debasement of fiat currency.
Just my 2 satoshis.  Nobody is buying Bitcoin as a means of exchange.  Bcashers think this is a huge deal, but either they aren't paying attention to the actual real world use of crypto currencies, or they're all committing tax fraud by not paying large tax bills as a result of spending their digital cash.
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:14:15
I agree.  This is on bitcoin at the end of the day.
If a company like coinbase can cripple bitcoin so easily, it is a failed experiment if it is not resolved.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:01:12
Nice.  
Sold at $9900 after breaking through the 10k milestone after popping off of the 11,400 ATH.  My impatience got the best of me and I'm back in a little high now.
Ah well.  Nice snag.   I'm jealous.  Patience really does pay off in crypto.  Impatience can really wreck a portfolio for no real good reason at all.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:10:06
What is the limit of ETH tokens?
As far as I'm aware there is no limit and it's supply is controlled by a team of people.
It doesn't look like ETH is intended to be a currency, nor a store of value.
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:15:54
Likewise.  If you're holding crypto for the mere speed and affordability to purchase coffee or niche shit on the internet you don't understand fundamental value of a permission-less globally distributed ledger system.
People hold BTC because it is the standard of such.  It is the world reserve proof of work currency.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:02:26
It's based on the number of inputs in your transaction.. not the amount of bitcoin or dollar amount.
It's based on the number of records so to speak that are in your wallet.  The IN/OUTS, etc that makes up your balance.  
A relatively new unused wallet will be cheaper than a wallet with tons of history/ inputs.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:57:40

50% off it's ATH.
Sounds great to me.
These are the days we accumulate boys.
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:55:15
It's actually quite relevant.
This is why people are holding Bitcoin.  Either to speculate on the future of crypto or to hedge against destructive government monetary policy and currency debasement.
This is what bcashers don't understand.  People aren't holding Bitcoin at the moment to buy coffee and trinkets on the internet.  They're holding it because they're tired of getting fucked by their governments.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:21:14
Holding fiat and investing in fiat denominated instruments is blind hope.  Hope you don't get Cyprus'd.  Hope you don't get Venezuela'd.  Hope the police don't consider you a criminal and freeze your assets/take your cash.
Bitcoin is THE invention of the most decentralized secure ledger on the planet secured by math and cryptography.  It has achieved a level of global trust and has survived nearly a decade now of resistance &amp; FUD.
Bitcoin is becoming a global reserve currency bound by no borders or central authority.


No, that's called confidence.  All currencies rely on them, and the newest shit coin to hit the market isn't anything that can't be adopted and layered onto bitcoin should it offer insight to worthy technological evolution of Bitcoin.  Cheap micropayments will be a mere layer of everything that Bitcoin can offer....The whitepaper is not religion, and bitcoin is far more than a p2p cash just as the internet has evolved to far more than a thing to transitmit raw data to researchers as originally intended.  They've never dealt with the scale that bitcoin has encountered therefore they've yet to encounter the problems that bitcoin is experiencing as the masses realize it's importance as global  trusted proof of work.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:14:42
Feeling the same.  Not enough fear yet.
There is a post on the front page about "Surviving the Crash".. lmao.  We ran from 1k to 20k this year.  Sitting at nearly 15k now.. that was hardly even a meaningful pullback.
We will definitely test the low 10s again at least.

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:14:37
Why wouldn't you sell at 18k or 19k..  It's better to sell into an uptrend than to sell when you've got a bunch of competition also selling.
If you're selling while BTC is dropping you're doing it wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:41:29
Can you suggest a stronger more decentralized network than Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:26:55
Nothing you can do now.
In the future login to GDAX.com with your coinbase login.  Deposit coins into there from Coinbase (it's instant).  You can then withdraw from there and GDAX covers the network fee.
You can also buy and sell there using LIMIT order to incur no fees.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:06:38

Maybe short term rallies, but ultimately none of them can touch the security and large scale decentralized network of Bitcoin.  THAT is what makes Bitcoin so important.  It's bigger than just a P2P cash now - it's base layer must remain free, secure, and decentralized.  Decentralization over everything.  They will fix the fee issue (due to rapid increased growth of Bitcoin) in time and the possibilities of 2nd layer solutions is endless (all while keeping core BTC code sound).  The future for BTC and humanity is bright.
*I've not been paying the fees because I use gdax to withdrawl (no fee), my transfers personally have been really quick.  They show instantly (10 min during bcash/coinbase mania) in my Trezor and confirm in about 20 min.  Anyone know why this is?  Does gdax get priority on their transfers or pay a ton?   I'm not experiencing the speed issues claimed here.  My deposits to gdax are decently quick as well.  I use the normal fee in Trezor.

Yea, fees are fucked right now. 
In the meantime use your coinbase login over at gdax.com.  Deposit your BTC into there (it's instant from coinbase) and then withdraw from there to your wallet.  No fee .. gdax pays it.
That said, if you want to move your coins from your wallet you'll incur a similar fee until BTC resolves these issues.

GDAX using limit orders will avoid the fee.
It's not as easy as you think though.
Buy 1 btc for 14k - sell it for 15k.  You profit $1000, but also owe capital gains tax if you're in the US.


Sometimes you're not that lucky.  A lot of times BTC will walk away from you, meaning you'd be buying less and less coin as time goes on.  The dip never comes.
You have to take into account your taxes and the possibility that you won't be able to buy back in lower.  You'll have gained in profit (USD), but actually lost in Bitcoin. Add in the tax you now owe and it's honestly a losing situation if your goal is more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:05:05


Well the mere fact that Bitcoin is a rather young &amp; experimental currency should tell you that.
As I suggested in my prior comment the answers to those questions do not appear to be static, therefore there is no way to confidently answer those questions,... thus I'm not sure what lesson you were referring to was.
The possible answer to all of those questions appears to be "Variable".

Never will I go full fiat again.  BTC is friction less gold.  Even when it's down it's still a great thing to own.  The world is too uncertain.
This will give devs time to rollout their improvements before the next leg up.  Will also allow those who sold too early to re-accumulate decent positions and more investors to enter the space comfortably.

Everyone is still in the positive unless you bought in the last 4 days  (or the previous 15 minute rally to 19.7k)  so I'd say they're still doing alright.

Bitcoin parabolic trend is still intact.  
Those who got off this wild ride or swapped for btrash alt are in for a lot of regret when this bull marches onward.  She charges when least expected.
Huge buy volume anytime it dips below 16k.  This bull is still very much alive - just taking a breather.
It's going to rocket upwards so fast when profits are taken out of insanely valued alts (most merely concepts) and the remainder of those bcash wanting to dump have liquidated.  People will start panic buying at 20k not knowing what the hell just happened.
This this crypto bitches!  Are you IN?  Scared money don't make money.  So tired of hearing these children whine about the $50 they lost because they bought and it went down a little.  It's up 2000% this year you morons!
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:47:36
Sure thing.
There is a reason gdax has had to take BCH trading offline several times now.  Flopped launch no liquidity..trying to start trading at 8.4k and then 4.3k with no price discovery mechanisms in place to warrant that in the 1st place. WTF was that all about?  BTC/BCH pairings not until Jan now - would have been a disaster.  Euro markets unstable to let play out.
Doing everything they can to prop it up.  Roger's nicely timed pumps are all they got.
Look for yourself.. No real organic volume/growth.  It's in correlation with BTC drop almost in lock step.  It's propped up by BTC big whales with an interest in keeping it alive.  It's all theater.
Coinbase will improve that and quite possibly legitimize it more in the coming year, but BCH is everything but.  Jihan a smart dude and roger is a persistent rich maniac so I wont stand in it's way, but this altcoin will never overthrow BTC.
You're being duped by the very well played marketing campaign.  Bitcoin doesn't need a marketeer.  I fell for the BCH crap around Aug 1st as well.  "The true people's coin".  And then I did my research.
Centralized china coin.  No thanks.

If it falls between 12k and 11k buy with both hands.  
You can't get the good deals unless you use an exchange and buy using limit order.  That is how you automatically trigger those whipsaw down moves while your asleep.
Dollar cost average into your position.  Buy some now, buy some at 13.5k, 12k, etc.
Many prefer to wait until the uptrend is reestablished, or at least believed to be. Won't get the cheapest coin, but less downside risk and uncomfortable feeling.

Use it peer 2 peer with both parties using segwit wallets.  Fee crisis averted.

Take it up with Gdax for not using implementing Segwit.
Peer to Peer transaction using segwit addresses is fast and cheap.
That fact that coinbase/gdax offered a shitcoin on their platform before segwit implementation and the ability to keep their servers operational speaks volumes.

Supposed to sell when it's high and accumulate during these lows, leaving plenty of dry powder to back up the truck the farther we fall.
Good luck.  Congrats if you're leaving with profits.  
I'll now always keep a core position in crypto regardless of price as a hedge against an increasingly chaotic world.  There is value in censorship resistant money and the other amazing properties of bitcoin.  You never know how easily it will be to acquire if really truly needed it.

The point in financial sovereignty.  A peer to peer system that allows one to transact without centralized authority.
I don't disagree that bitcoin is crippled right now for smaller transactions (especially when using non-segwit services), but I'm willing to wait for secure improvements that fix the issue without eventually sacrificing one's ability to run a node and be responsible and capable for verifying transactions on the blockchain themselves - not relying on 3rd part which big block scaling ultimately will lead to.
If in the future I have to rely on 3rd party to verify the ledger Bitcoin is a failed experiment.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:13:33
Currency is backed by people's confidence.
People have a lot of confidence in BTC because it is a trustless system built on math and cryptography.

Hmm.. thats odd..
When you do a withdraw from Gdax it does technically transfer it back to coinbase and then withdraws so it is perfectly normal to see that activity in your account.  I'm surprised it let you send back over to gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:44:35
nah, that's it.
Move to gdax 1st and send for free.  Might want to wait until their status on BTC transfer turns back to operational (currently degraded), but I've sent no problem regardless. (my most recent send was during height of bcash mania - no problems).
Usually when it's all gravy I get instant propagation into destination wallet and confirmation 20-30min later.
When it's degraded it takes a bit to reflect in my trezor (even prior to confirmation), but is in there when I check a few hours later to make sure.  
You can confirm all is well after withdraw by going back into coinbase and seeing the references to it there and the address you sent to.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:49:33
It's doing a damn good job at hedging against destructive monetary policy while remaining one of the only forms of censorship resistant money bound by no borders on this entire planet.
...and nearly everyone that's held onto it has seen 2000% growth this year which I assure you is completely usable fiat able to be withdrawn at any time.  Right now BTC is a completely liquid asset and currency able to be held oneself outside of the reach of centralized authority.  2nd scaling layers while keeping BTC base layer safe and intact will allow this thing to scale to use cases unimaginable right now besides just sound currency.
If you think that is unusable you're delusional.  
BTC is young and is more important than any shitcoin.  They'll ultimately be built on and around BTC as secondary layers evolve.  BTC will remain king because it's level of security &amp; decentralized is what makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin.

Bitcoin will continue to absorb capital long term because fiat currencies of the world are a real ponzi scheme and everything is a cycle of bubbles. 
Bitcoin is the fucking honey badger of money and if you think there is not insane money on the sidelines ready to buy as this finds bottom (be that 13k or 8k whatever) you're not looking at the bigger picture.

Yes - possibly.  Use caution here.
I believe you'll want to turn off 2FA and then get a new phone and set it back up.
Not sure about your 2nd question.  You can normally just restore with your seed, but that might not even be necessary with blockchain.info wallet.  You might just be able to login once installing the new app.
Definitely be careful with your 2FA stuff though.  It is possible to be locked out if you just get a new phone, and didn't turn it off prior or have your 2fa backup code.

But the true whales appear to have no interest in selling.
Debt fiat creation is the bubble.  They are the beneficiaries of being early adopters of new sound money.
They'll pull fiat as needed, and I'm sure many have and do diversify into traditional investments and real estate, but there is no real incentive to "cash out".
Flash cash out their multi million plus dollar BTC stacks sitting in cold storage for what?   What does this imply?  Please do tell.
Big whale early adopters have no interest in going 100% fiat and taking down bitcoin.  The may manipulate the price to increase their BTC count, but that can't only continue for so long as there are weak hands who don't understand the value of sound censorship free money.
HODL.  If if whales want to "pop" this bubble so be it.  We'll buy their coin and 1/4 of the total will start to spread into the hands of many.

@_date: 2017-12-20 20:07:47
Correct.  Although you might want to sell in chunks if you had that kind of stack.  Furthermore GDAX is FDIC insured (USD wallet), but I imagine that is around $250k insured.  
I would likely request higher withdraw limits and try to keep my USD balance under that.  I imagine the best course of action would be to get those limits raised ahead of time and immediately wire funds to your bank account as opposed to doing ACH transfers.
There are probably better ways to cash out millions, but I unfortunately don't have to worry about that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:03:42
I foolishly dumped my BTC after $10k and a large accumulation of LTC sold at $88.  I wrecked my position, owe the IRS, and now hold significantly less coin after buying back.  Got froggy on my birthday and thought I'd take profits and buy back lower after what I was certain was the "correction" at the 11.4k "pop".
I can't help but to check my no longer held portfolio totals.  It was in the neighborhood of 170+k (even before alts pumped).  This is off a 30k investment a mere 6 months ago..  Makes me sick I let it walk away from me.
Continue to HODL.  Only take profits if it's for a big goal in your life like that debt.  If those college loans are low interest let em ride personally... 
I had a few very self destructive couple of weeks.  I'm back on this bull, but never again.  HODL.. keep coin out of the exchanges and keep hardware/paper wallet tucked away so you truly have to evaluate your decision to liquidate.
2018/19 is Crypto's year.  This is going to be huge, and likely in a bigger way than ever imaginable.

I moved them off during the height of the bcash drama.  No problems, but you really should do it through gdax for no fees.
use coinbase login at gdax.  deposit BTC into gdax from coinbase (instant).  Then withdraw from there to your BTC address.
I've had no problems.  It's actually been really quick to my trezor. Instant propagation through the network and confirms in around 20-30 min.
*in gdax you'll see status if BTC withdrawals are degraded performance. 
*They are showing degraded at the moment.  I've sent during these periods will still no trouble, but maybe not at 250k unconfirmed transactions.  Not sure how much of that is spam.  Might be best to test a small amount 1st to gauge network speed.  
Again, GDAX withdraw is free.  They cover the fee themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:22:25
lmao.   We have ours.  It's Bitcoin.  It's were ~280 billion dollar stays because it's trustless.
Our needs to be free, secure, and decentralized currently trump the needs for penny transactions for rare or imaginary coffee transactions.  
The fee issues will be resolved with tech that can truly take BTC into the future as opposed to just bandaging over them.  
Bitcoin is young.  Bitcoin is experiencing growing pains.  Bitcoin is resilient and this bull run is far from over.  Parabolic trend is still intact and until that changes this is 100% all day bshill FUD!
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:39:46

for the HODLer ...  best thing ever.
They also show in my Trezor nearly instantly and have been confirming within 30 minutes.  I haven't experienced any speed issues or stuck transactions and I moved the last of my BTC from gdax during the height of the botched bcash launch fiasco last night.  Is this because GDAX pays big/gets priority or is more closely with miners or something?
I've also had no real issues sending my BTC from Trezor to gdax or bittrex.  
I'm not denying the fees because I see what fee is associated with my transfer and I'm glad I'm not paying it, but speeds have been fine over here.

Not necessarily true.  They may be able to take other assets, or lock you in a cage, but ultimately it's up to you to release your private key or not.
I'll point to the FBI's bitcoin wallets as my Exhibit A. 
I'm not familiar with the details but I'm guessing they were *voluntarily* relinquished in some type of plea deal?
If someone wants to take their private keys or seed words to their death they certainly can.
That is what Bitcoin ultimately is at the end of the day.  Choice.

I agree.
If there comes a day when the people realize that they truly need Bitcoin.  It won't be available.
Gold/Silver bug here.. been a big bag holder as I got in during the silver rally several years back.  Continue to hold because of it's safe haven properties and unique features of discreteness and censorship resistance similar to bitcoin.  
It seems though as a result of the fees everyone is up in arms about Bitcoin being a p2p currency, "but Satoshis vision".. and it's ability to replace Visa/Mastecard style transactions.  So concerned about buying that damn coffee.
I believe that will come in time, but BTC has value for me today, regardless of high fees.  It's a safe haven outside of their system and it's use case applies regardless of the fee. 
To transact peer to peer with discretion and flexibility outside of centralized authority.
I'm here for the disruption, not the coffee.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:23:20


Bitcoin does have value though.  It allows you to store a portion of your wealth in your memory if you'd like.  More importantly it allows you to hold wealth outside of the central banking system and destructive government monetary policies.  
It's censorship proof and can be sent anywhere 24/7 without asking anyone for permission.  Nobody can stop the transaction.
Ask him what other asset or currency would allow him to store a million dollars in his mind by simply remembering a series of words.
Bitcoin's value is in it's utility.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:42:14
Can't fault you there.  I actually moved a bit of my holdings to Monero and honestly wish I would have moved a little more had I known this bcash stuff was going to pop off.  Quiet bull over there.
That said, keep watching the charts.  The parabolic trend that took us from 1k to 20k is actually still intact.  Huge volume on the few wicks that took us below 16k, but if we can hold here and consolidate for a bit I'm watching for the next leg up.  These markets will move when least expected.. I went to fiat prematurely expecting a large pullback and essentially wrecked my position.  I'm back in with significantly less coin, but have decided it's riskier to be out and miss the next ride vs. ride out the bumps.  Big money IS still moving into bitcoin.  This bull is just taking a breather.
Best of luck.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:08
nah just a hunch,  that just seems to be what happens.
You really think alts are going to continue to rock it during a BTC correction?  They normally get pulled down along with BTC, not act as a safe haven.
Sometimes it pays to be contrarian.
Herd rallying into BTC, Alts depressed - Buy Alts
Herd fleeing to gains in ALTS, BTC stagnating or declining - Buy BTC.
Most people do the opposite.  I want to load up more on alts myself, but no way in hell I'm buying at these prices.  The majority of these alts don't even have a product, they're merely concepts.  No reason the have the market capitalization that some of them have.
I have no idea what's going on.  BTC might be going to 8k.  Or it might rally back and blow through 20k.  The charts indicate a possible pullback to the 8k range.  I do find it hard to believe that institutional money will be jumping in AFTER us retail investors.  No way they want to be loading up at these prices,  Either this last "rally" was them getting in at the dip to 13k, or we're still going to see blood in the streets at some point. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:41:43
BCH doesn't appear to be liquid on gdax.  Massive buy orders sprung it to these levels and now there is a massive 3000 BCH sell wall that will bring it back down.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:44:20
Well yea.  We see exponential growth not necessarily currently warranted by the current tech/use.... whales and early investors take profits after 2000% gains this year while new investors continue to fomo in at all time highs.  Weak hands who bought in at high levels panic at the profit taking thinking BTC is dead and sell.  This causes a cascade of panic sellers and stop loss triggers.
Whales step back in at a certain point to reaccumulate their stacks (now larger) and the bull marches onward.  New investors see the strong uptrend and buy back in at even higher highs.  The cycles continue.
You should either sell *into* the parabolic trend.
Or buy more at the dip, wait for what you think is a bottom, etc.
But *selling* at the dip is a losers game.
Timing this thing is the difficult part.  I sold around 10k because I thought we were in for the correction at 11.4k "pop".  I obviously was insanely wrong.  Re-bought and will continue to hold and accumulate for the next leg up.  If we see lower.. I'll accumulate more.  
I maybe a noob, but I'm smarter than those realizing their losses out of panic.  These are cycles... unless for some reason you think bitcoin is toast (highly unlikely).  Doubt it..  nothing has changed.  Was the sky falling when BTC dropping from 8k back to 5k in Nov?  Why didn't it go back to $2000?  Are the same drivers in place that brought us here from $2500 a mere 6 months ago?
Nothing has really changed.  The fees were high then.  They're high now.  It'll eventually be resolved.  BTC is getting mainstream attention,  it's being legitimized on wallstreet...
I don't really see any reasons to be bearish.  I'll reconsider my thoughts if we don't hold around these levels, but there isn't much to do except hodl and accumulate more.  10k was less than a month ago.. keep that in mind.  We may be going to 8k.. we might go to 20k.

You need to go back over to coinbase and you'll be able to see the address you sent it to in your history there.

So it's your actual legitimate receive address or it's a different one?
If it's your address and it shows in block explorer.. you're ok.  It will eventually show in your wallet.
If it's not your address.. yes, they are likely gone.  Your machine may be infected or something and somebody swapped your address upon pasting it in or something.

Not always the case however.  You're forgetting the benefits of liquid capital (dry powder) to in order to strike when the iron is hot.  
You're at risk of missing amazing opportunities if you keep available liquid capital limited to just an emergency fund.

Yes!  Because in a sound money economy saving *IS* lending.  It rewards those who forgo goods today for increased purchasing power tomorrow.  The low-risk loan is deflation and it is redeemed by the saver upon spending.
The need for an elastic and ever growing money supply is a myth (lie) perpetuated by the money for nothing club in order to continuously siphon wealth from those who earn it.
We are the banks now.
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:01:53
Bitcoin is a good "investment" because it's sound money unlike our current inflationary and elastic fiat currency..  It rewards savers and merchants who choose defer goods today to redeem more purchasing power from their sound money IOUs tomorrow.
Bitcoin *is* investing, because saving *is* lending in a sound money economy.


I agree with your initial statement as we currently live in a fiat ponzi scheme, but Bitcoin will always be a good investment as it will always reward savers with increased purchasing power because that is what happens in an economy of truly sound money.

I actually meant overvalued, but no, not specifically off the top of my head, but there are a lot of junk ICOs with no real product or token purpose.
I do know when I entered this space back in July or so the total crypto market cap was only 150 billion.  In a quick 6 months it's soared to over 600 billion.  That's a shit ton of growth for companies with essentially a concept, many without working platforms, wallets/ developer kits, etc,etc..  Others simply with no real world applications.
I do think BTC being used as a replacement for venture capitalism is awesome though.  2018 and 19 should be awesome as these ICOs are now very well funded and we should see who is worth their hype or not as things move forward.
This isn't the place for it, but I'm bullish on real use applications such as things coming out of Factom &amp; Power Ledger.  I'm also bullish on Lisk and similar platforms that should start getting development on in 2018/19.

Good read - thanks for the write up.  It's a lot to think about, and I'm no economist to bare with me here. 


Not necessarily - there will always be trade.  I believe this to unsubstantiated as I don't think investment ends with bitcoin despite it rewarding you for saving it.  
If someone has the option to hoard bitcoin and see x% growth per year vs. *actually* invest that bitcoin and see x% PLUS investment growth per year why is it popular to assume many people would not choose option 2.  What you do with it -- in terms of investments -- is going to be determined by what's profitable after risk is accounted for. For people to hoard their wealth you'd have to assume that all investment opportunity has been reduced to zero, after risk is accounted for.
This premise also massively underestimates peoples' ability to blow all of their wealth too. The more you have, the wilder your taste for spending it.  On the contrary some wealthy people are generous philanthropists who give all or most of their wealth away.  Others will destroy their wealth through extravagance and shitty investments.
Furthermore, if someone never spends their coins they reduce the supply of coins (just as if they'd lost them), increasing the value of other coins and allowing the economy to redistribute their wealth to all other bitcoin holders.
Are rent-seekers a bad thing in a sound money economy?  As you call it, bitcoin removes much of the incentive by the rich to invest their coins in production capacity. This means that the little guy does not have to compete with as many big corporations and will invest their time and labor into moving up the rung of society until they to have enough to retire on.
Again,  I'm not an economist, nor am I sure I'm even smart enough on the topic to be having this conversation while remaining consistent and thoughts and understanding of it all, but it's fascinating stuff and I appreciate the dialog.  
@_date: 2018-05-05 01:51:33
In an economy of truly sound money it is.
I don't think you're understanding the point entirely. When you save money (even if you just stick cash in a safe -- or bitcoins in a cold wallet) you are forgoing your right to make an immediate claim on a certain amount of *stuff* in the real world today. To use another example, if you have enough money to buy a car today but hold off buying the car for a year, that car is still available to be immediately used by someone else. You have effectively loaned it to them. (the key is to remember that money isn't wealth, but merely a means of accounting for the exchange of wealth.. its an IOU)
Deflation *is* a form of interest in a sound money economy, or at least that is what I'm trying to get you to conceptualize with the saving is lending statement.
You're lending out the goods and services that you produced to earn your monetary income, not the goods and services that you might buy in the future.
It's just an interesting way of thinking about it as a lot of people seem to think that an economy built on deflationary currency will not work because it incentivizes people to save or hoard their money. People have been taught that inflation is necessary and I don't believe that to be true.
You have to remember that money isn't wealth, and bitcoin isn't the end of the line.

Because dollars are printed at the tune of some ~$200+ billion a ~~day~~ month.
I know how fiat currencies end, Bitcoin is something different.
There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins.  Less in reality with locked/lost coins, etc.  
This is just yet another transfer of wealth.  People with patience are the ones who are ultimately rewarded.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:17:34
An infinite amount of paper chasing a finite amount of Bitcoin.  So long as BTC doesn't die completely reduced purchasing power of the dollar (due to currency debasement) should always eventually result in Bitcoin's USD dominated price rising to account for USD inflation.


I don't disagree with you there.  Way too many speculators with dreams of lambos got involved.
The question is are those the buyers who drove us from 2k to 10k, or are those the buyers who drove us from 10k to 20k.  There actually was support around 8k before things really went haywire, but who knows.. 2k may be in the cards again.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:30:31
Bitcoin a year ago $900
Bitcoin today $8600
Yea, most of us got rekt?  lol....Damn near everyone side from those who bought into BTC 8 weeks ago are still sitting the black.  Even those that bought way too high are still looking pretty decent had they divested into a few alts 6 months ago.  You realize things like IOTA were .40 ..6 months ago... Dragonchain .24.  Check the prices today.  These are just a few examples, there are literally hundreds.
You would have made 10x if you bought BTC last year and just held, and that's even after a ~60% correction.  You would have made 20x if you pulled out in the months that BTC traded between 17-20k.
Enjoy your 6x and tax liability...  Holding for multiple years has been resulting in gains many multiples of that.  6x is great, congrats seriously, but for a gambler why not go for the whammy.  
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:56:15


Likewise,  just because you can put some fiat profit in your pocket doesn't mean it's the right move either.
People who hold are not brainwashed, it's just been a pretty decent strategy historically.  There will only ever be 21 million BTC, less if you consider how many are lost/locked.
Timing the market isn't always easy.  I've tried to hop out with profit and hop back in after a pullback.  I botched the timing, and now will never own the amount of BTC I once did and I also triggered a tax event which further ate into my profits.  The price ran away on me.  I gained some fiat profits, I ultimately lost BTC I can never get back.
How big of loss (or lost opportunity) is it to hold LESS bitcoin than you previously would have, is yet to be determined.    This market can do crazy things, and it usually does them quick with sentiment reversing on a dime.
I'm not knocking your strategy.  To each their own, but just a glimpse of another perspective.   Everyone has different goals.  I'm pessimistic on fiat and it's future.  I realized my mistake as soon as I took profits on what I thought was a correction and the dip never came.  I've got fiat, I earn more every day, but I can likely never afford to buy back the BTC, ETH, LTC, XMR, etc that I once held.  If you take profits early and ultimately have to buy back in at a higher price, are they really profits?  Your strategy assumes you'll always be taking profits at the right time and catching a correction properly.
Congrats if you can do that - boat loads can't - which is why they now HOLD.  Only takes one mistake to erase a whole lot of previous profits (and unfortunately the IRS doesn't look at it that way).  You also have to pretty much keep your coins on an exchange to play your strategy as I assume it involves the use of stop losses.  That in itself is risky.
Best of luck.  Be careful out there.  I've taken "profits" while simultaneously wrecking myself in the larger picture.

It just doesn't make any sense though.  Poor people are poor because they make poor decisions, crypto or otherwise.  That same person who charged $4000 on crypto could have just as easily charged $4000 for a jetski, motorcycle, or other material possession that they can't afford.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:28:27
Where do the true hodlers hold?
Obviously visions of lambos and insane amounts of FOMO drove Bitcoin to insane levels.  Profits are still being taken and can easily be taken pretty low considering Bitcoin's 2017 run.. at the same time weak hands still doing what they do best - panic selling.  This is a traders dream and a recipe for big bargains.
Are the buyers that took us from 2k to 10k any different than the buyers who took us from 10k to 20k?
I personally think massive money is waiting for their cheap coins.  They're gonna watch this bleed until it doesn't bleed anymore, but at some point large money is joining back in.  Strong hangs will determine if that is at 7-8k or 1-2k.
Despite what it looks, this is good for Bitcoin.  This gives opportunity to those who sold premature at 10k the chance to buy back their position, as well as give those who feel like they missed the boat a chance to enter Bitcoin for the first time.
This is healthy.  Bullish.

Yea,  it's better to buy into a rally than to try and time the bottom and buy into a downward move.
Buying at 15k was smart on the way up.
Buying at 15k was foolish on the way down.

Well yea,  that's the plan.  Your investment window for BTC is under 3 years?
I'd love 3 years to accumulate more Bitcoin before the masses finally figure out what the fuck it really is an how to get it.  Lots of questions from everyone during Bitcoins recent runs.. the majority still confused as hell trying to wrap their heads around it.  I know 2 people in real life who actually bought.    And these are career people already making 6-7 figure salaries.
Bitcoin is wild and got overbought for it's current level of development.  Bitcoin is young.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:53:08
Why would the banks care though?  
They don't seem to have a problem with someone charging up thousands of dollars for 26" rims to put on a $1000 beater, or any other stupid material possessions people use credit cards for.  If anything they actually prefer a customer not being able to pay the balance, hence incurring the interest.  It's how their model works.


Not necessarily.  Much of my crypto during the last rally was purchased on credit.  Bitcoin was on a parabolic bull run.  Waiting 7-10 days for ACH to post to my account would have been devastating in lost opportunity.   I happily paid the 4% as it didn't matter.  I don't incur interest as I pay my balance in full, but purchasing on credit was a solid strategy for the financially responsible during the previous year.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:10:39
Bingo.  8k pullback has been in the cards for awhile.  It never came.... until now.  
We'll likely overshoot a bit, but these are the days us smaller guys start accumulating again.  I'll buy this thing all the way down with little emotion, because there is no picking the bottom and it'll be multiples higher than the bottom once large money rejoins.
It's best to buy into a rally than trying to catch a falling knife or better yet sitting on big capital with limit orders setup and layered down, but it's not always realistic for those who have limited resources.  What's important is accumulation on significant corrections, such as the one we're experiencing now.
Bitcoin is still in a parabolic trend long term in my opinion.  Nothing has really changed (unless delusioned by bcashers or government fud).  Those who sell at 6k,7k,8k will have similar regrets to those who sold at $300 after "poppin" off of $1000.
The bigger and quicker the moves, the crazier the volatility and inevitable panic and profit taking.  This is crypto.
The question is will there be enough of a buying bounce to not drag this correction out for 1+ years.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:14:53
I don't necessary disagree.  Currency runs on confidence certainly.
Bitcoin has nearly a decade of battle scars and is the most trusted PoW currency.   I don't think it's track record is going to allow it to be overthrown anytime soon... at least not in the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:00:14
Costly in terms of fiat derived purchasing power.
Bitcoin is still the only asset that I know of that I can hold in my memory outside of centralized authority and relocate to anywhere in the world if need be. 
There is value to that.
When the population really needs Bitcoin the most,  there will be little available at that time.  Bitcoin is just another hedge in an uncertain world.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:51:41
Because the last time someone said that it went to 20k.  
Like all of us that sold after the 10k milestone after the 11.4k "pop" that we were sure was the start of the "correction".
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:07:54
I guess, if they can locate them.
They however still allow precious metals to be purchased with credit.  One could just as easily buy gold bars with credit, bury it in the ground, and default on the debt.
I wonder if this is BoA reasoning.  I'm curious if there has been a large influx of scammers buying crypto with credit and just never paying the debt/filing bankruptcy, or otherwise acquiring it with stolen identities or something.  If you had nothing to lose and didn't mind destroying your credit and ability to use credit again, someone with a shit load of available credit could max everything out and walk away with their "free" crypto, never to be seen again.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:27:32
I'd love to do that.  Can you lend me the contact for your crystal ball manufacturer?  Mine is a bit cloudy it seems.
I previously sold at $9900 when Bitcoin was coming down quick from $11,400 looking to open a position again once it dropped.  
Bitcoin ran to nearly 20k.
One could set a buy order at 7500, BTC could dip to 7600 (order unfilled)  and we wake up at 10k again.  Nobody knows.
This is why dollar cost averaging into a position is a thing,.  60% correction might be a better place to start placing some buys as opposed to selling now hoping for drop after we've just had a massive one (or it might not).   What percentage drop do you start buying back in at?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:09:01
Because institutional money and governments wanting to ultimately hold BTC as part of their foreign reserves want CHEAP Bitcoin.
They're not getting them out of my stack.  
They're gonna bleed it until it won't bleed anymore and massive money is going to buy the bottom.  Nothing has really changed.   Bitcoin is still the largest most secure immutable ledger on the planet.  It is the world reserve Proof of Work currency.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:26:19
ah,  I meant per month not per day.
*Global* Quantitative Easing efforts... no specific numbers particularly at this time, but central banks and governments across the global participating in asset purchasing programs, etc.  Pretty sure the US alone was around $85 billion a month in bond buying programs and other shit just a few years back.  Further QE is right around the corner.
