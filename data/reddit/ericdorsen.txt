Everyone should report their websites: btcwithdraw.net and btctopaypal.net to abuse-contact . This will take their domains down. Removing them from Reddit isn;t enough.
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:00:25
This is a confidence test on this community to see if they really care for the good of honest bitcoiners. I'm really curious :)
@_date: 2014-02-02 23:16:09
Just do it, if they receive several emails stating the same thing maybe they'll look into it. Just contacting the person that registered the domain should prove that they used fake registration info which causes an automated suspend on their domain. There is a user there tomuchfun who claims to be ripped of 1.552 BTC . If you look at the 2 websites you can see for yourself that they are bogus ones. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 23:17:34
Paypal is probably the main reason why i began looking into Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:33:04
Seems like the post was removed. Everyone should send an email to abuse-contact in order to have their domain BTCTOPAYPAL.NET taken down. That will at least slow them down. Thank you to everyone helping.

It looks clearly as a scam. Just look at the users who tried to comment here. They joined reddit few days ago, no link karma, no comment karma. All the votes were made from the same accounts. Domain was created on Creation Date: 10-Jan-2014 . 100% SCAM IMO 
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:39:28
This scam is probably being run on several websites. People should be aware of this. BITCOIN+PAYPAL is a NO NO
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:24:15
They are using several accounts to downvote anyone who argues their legitimacy. Would really like to see some honest people joining me there to take them down. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:11:11
Using several accounts and downvoting my replies won't help you. I know what a scam is probably better than you. THIS IS A SCAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!

Probably much less as most of it will be owned by a small percentage of the world's population.
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:40:50
Also someone should look into how will they be able to purchase btc as their banks might not be receptive to transferring money outside the country. In such countries there is a wider control that the authorities impose on it's citizens.
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:53:17
As long as you sold at profit you shouldn't have to worry about anything else now. The rest is a bonus so you should clear your mind and relax.

If fiat goes all the way into bitcoin, the ones who now own the money will own in bitcoin as well. I think there are many ways for them to keep manipulating the civilians and still keep the power. The banks are only a part of their control system. You have a good point but nobody knows how it will be.It can be either way.  Too bad our world is only thinking about money. We should have had other priorities ;)
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:03:22
I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully the price will rise again and you will be able to pay your loan. You shouldn't have done that in the first place. Never borrow money from loan sharks.

Bitcoin is better than any altcoin. All altcoins are somehow a copy of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:04:31
People should be using Bitcoin to buy stuff instead of looking at it as a commodity. When they'll do that bitcoin will trully become what is was meant to be.
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:32:13
I never even considered buying one.
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:52:26
It's not only about dollars, it's about fiat. In my opinion the dollar is loosing value and will loose in the future. There are other fiat currencies that hold more value/stability than the dollar. Also most of the bitcoin holders now are looking at fiat earnings when they thing about their bitcoins and if they hit a huge price they'll start selling at least a portion of their wallet.

Should it be the large traffic ? Is anyone else having problems with it?
@_date: 2013-12-22 10:08:44
Romania is one of the top 10 countries regarding internet speed and traffic in the world so it might be a good candidate for bitcoin adoption. Romania has a population of approx 21 millions. The volume of cash in it's economy is worth about 30-40 billion dollars. Bitcoin is presented as a risky investment by the media. Romania's government will follow EU's decisions about bitcoin. So if the EU will say bitcoin is bad then Romania will say it's bad as well. Bitcoin awareness in Romania might trigger a black market move on it which i don't know if it would help Bitcoin at all.

Where will they store 1.3 billion ids? :))
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:46:25
Another reason to buy and store btc. Maybe they have a plan for it and we can take advantage of that.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:19:17
But if it were to happen then you must admit that they will try to lower the prices. We are talking about professionals targeting a market driven by emotion.
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:31:27
Bubble no bubble it shouldn't concern those who actually believe in bitcoin. As for the ones who tried to earn a quick profit looks like some of them will make good use of their health insurance.
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:39:07
Good point, you get back to the human nature. But we are talking here about a possible huge change in the financial system and such thing cannot go without supervision. One way or another we will have to organize to decide the faith of this currency. I would more likely go with a Online Democracy to regulate the bitcoin market than leaving it to governments or banks or any other shady organization. Getting the bitcoiners together and making them agree on something i think is the hardest thing to do.
@_date: 2013-12-22 12:03:52
Must have been the Bitcoin Santa :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:50:51
Good point, but i think gold will rise again as it has always been accepted as the basics of the financial system for thousands of years. Most of the world's population is still in the dark ages, it will take 50-100 years for all to join the digital revolution.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:14:17
I think the regulation on Bitcoin is coming sooner with such news. Now governments will have motives. "What if those angry bitcoiners attack us next?" . Also the media is presenting the mining rigs as supercomputers and people will think about "nuclear powered" ones that can get them through their laptops in their own home.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:57:20
There are a lot a lot of dumb people who bought just to make a quick profit and now they are the ones who sell. Anyone who is in this for the long run does not have to worry. We have already seen this in the past. Just sit back, relax and enjoy. The time will come.
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:11:24
Seems like a scam to me. You should ask and see how he would handle the deal and let us know here.
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:47:37
probably because it looks like a chart
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:22:00
Depends on the country. There are countries where people earn $2-300 per month. Also depends on your lifestyle.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:49:07
Probably will take a few days for it to stabilize. I believe that the ban on banks in China was wrong understood by many and that caused this panic. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:29:06
Greece is a good scenario for the Ukraine. Greece had wages of 1000 euros+ while in Ukraine probably the medium wage is arround $200-300.  There is a possibility there for the country to be split in 2 between UE and Russia. Let's hope it's not a Syria scenario.

Do something that makes you feel good. You must have hobbies so why don't you pick one up and try to forget a while about bitcoin. Store the remaining somewhere and consider them a long term investment if you really believe in btc.
Good luck ;)

@_date: 2013-12-09 08:38:09
That would mean that all fiat in the world would go into bitcoin and once that happens the won't be a fluctuation in the bitcoin price but in the prices of goods that you buy. Just like fiat today.

It's hard to predict now. Maybe by conquering a specific market as payment method will speed up bitcoin's adoption. For example if all digital goods would be sold in this currency. Also merchants accepting payments through bitcoin will cash out their coins and people will buy them. As long as there is demand for bitcoin we are safe :)

You can find answers to your questions by using search through this subreddit. As i've seen most newcomers ask the same questions over and over again. Most of those questions have been answered already. I know there are a few rude folks around here but the vast majority are the ones who actually help Bitcoin grow and gain new adopters.
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:50:21
You will pay a %fee of the final price your item sold for. They also suggest/impose you use paypal to receive your payment and get another fee from you. Paypal is owned by ebay as well. As a buyer you get protection for your purchase only if you use paypal. Kind of clever on their part.   
These plus any listing fees leads them to ripping you for a good percent of your money.

As of 2013, no countries use a gold standard. From 1936 until 2000 the Swiss Franc was based on a 40% gold-reserve. Gold reserves are held in significant quantity by many nations as a means of defending their currency and hedging against the dollar, which forms the bulk of liquid currency reserves.Both gold coins and gold bars are traded in liquid markets and serve as a private store of wealth.
Many countries including China and Russia might reinstate the gold standard.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:17:23
Nobody argues that China is driving the price down now but this is an opportunity for other to buy low and win on the next price rise. As of now i saw that bitcoin's price was helped by the wallstreet backed media. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:09:27
a combination between bitcoin and gold would probably speed up the fall of today's banks.
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:22:11
true, i was speaking hypothetically as well,  but my point is there won't be peace, it never was and never will be. Point me to a year in our history when the whole world was at peace. Indeed there won't be a place for conventional wars but if the money are online then the war will move there. Imagine a country or a corporation being left without their bitcoins. Won't that cause a conflict?

When prices fall someone buys a lot. It's the same with bitcoin. Any crash makes more people buy because they already saw it's price can go higher each time. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:22:27
I think that people that hold very large amounts of BTC will have to sustain the offer in order for their investment to pay off. Also by keeping the offer under the demand can can sustain a healthy price rise. Just a thought though ;)
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:35:44
Bitcoin plus a highly reputable cheap Escrow can easily replace paypal. In my opinion Paypal is acting like banks we all hate. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:14:30
Guess the Chinesewill buy more coins for a lower price. If you think that they caused the crash and they actually benefit from it. I feel bad for those who panic sold their coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:38:54
Most people heard of bitcoin but didn't understand exactly what it is. Most of them know that bitcoin price is rising or falling but they cannot explain what it does and why is adopted by a more and more people. I always try to explain bitcoin to them and they look really surprised when they hear it is a payment system and that is decentralized.

Bitcoin and altcoins can succeed together. I see bitcoin as the base network of the whole crypto currencies and it can be a standard for them just like gold is/was for fiat. Alcoins are usually valued related to bitcoin so this can be easily done. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:36:13

Can't wait to see brick&amp;mortar shops at every corner. Then you can go your bank and take cash and buy btc easily. Banks will fall if bitcoin takes over. They are scared they are loosing the power to rip us all off.

Bitcoin has the ability to rise to 1000 in a week or two if all media will runs articles showing that WallSteet and Silicon Valley are investing in it. It will be much more that it was 1 month ago when they were all showing China as buying in large. This time it can pass the gold price easily. Remember that these are early stages of bitcoin awareness to public.

It means financial institutions aka banks cannot invest/trade in bitcoin. Ordinary people can buy, trade, invest, sell and do whatever they want regarding to bitcoin. It truly amazes me how this news was understood by people. I think there are no 2 similar opinions to be found on reddit regarding this china news.
