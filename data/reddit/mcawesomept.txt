if I have an offline wallet for depositing only, what happens when one day I want to move some bitcoin to actual currency? does coinbase support importing, or I need a HW wallet?

I wouldn't consider this a showstopper. for me it was the opposite. got verified in 1 week in CB. still waiting for bitstamp, over 2 weeks now. don't think it is wise to decide if an exchange is good or bad based on a single factor. what about security? what about price? flexibility (gdax)? support is pretty much a trainwreck for all exchanges at the moment
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:11:03
that is why I have just bought a ledger nano s. I would like to diversify exchanges, but tbh, most of them had hacks already: bitstamp, bitfinex, etc.
edit: did not know that was the feeling at the time about mtg. it so, I'm even more concerned about security now. coinbase must be a big target for hackers right now

it flashes when you refresh the page. when you dismiss, it must store a cookie and you never see it again
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:32:11
in this case you have to be using their webpage. as soon as you leave thats the end of it. wouldnt be surprised to see other methods, router based for example, coming in the near future

thank you stranger

cool, thanks.

I wouldn't be so quick to say "stay away from coinbase".
have you researched the alternatives?
I suggest you do some research before trying to raise panic, just because you're having a bad experience
e.g.

disclaimer: I'm a noob.
read that segwit addresses are backwards compatible with legacy so you can send to/from segwit no problem.
unfortunately exchanges don't appear to be supporting it, but don't believe it just because I'm saying it:
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:28:14
all it says is that "If you are a United States resident, your Coinbase USD Wallet is covered by FDIC insurance, up to a maximum of $250,000.". this doesn't mean that EUR or GBP are not insured, just establishes a maximum amount for USD accounts.
either way, going into bitcoin assuming you are safe and can rely on exchange insurance is the worse thing you can do.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:45:40
coinbase is still imo the safest and most reliable exchange (and apparently pricier!) there is. things can change of course, but I mean, if you had a company with 200 employees for instance, and suddenly the whole world decided to request your services, wouldn't you be overwhelmed?
they are adapting, as you can find out on their public communications. if you want to use other exchanges, go ahead, but suddenly the "they take too long" problem can turn into "what happened to my money" problem
you have to try and survive without support cause it's you and another million users by now, why should they pay more attention to you? I have a ticket for almost 1 month, and not looking any better
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:03:44
I'm pretty happy with CB. sure don't even bother contacting support, and they go down often for maintenance, but overall it's pretty good. maybe a bit on the expensive side (
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:40:06
I feel a level of agree-ability, but come on, you've got to accept diversity and difference.
proof of success is also a way to bring in other "bitlievers" (claiming saying it first bragging rights)
edit: if you read carefully enough, you will find people investing everywhere from $1 to $1M. why don't you invest in starting altcoins which are just starting as opposed to throwing in the towel. it's like, you blame yourself for a past mistake, but you keep doing it right now...

You will not believe my story, but here it goes.
In the mid-21st century, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival. Joseph Cooper, a widowed former NASA pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law, son Tom, and daughter Murphy. Living in a post-truth society (Cooper is reprimanded for telling Murphy that the Apollo missions were not fake), Cooper encourages Murphy to carefully observe and record what she sees. They discover that dust patterns, which Murphy first attributes to a ghost, result from gravity variations and translate into geographic coordinates. These lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Cooper's former supervisor, Prof. John Brand.
Brand explains that 48 years earlier a wormhole appeared near Saturn, opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named Gargantua. Volunteers have previously traveled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reporting back desirable results. Plan A attempts to develop a new gravitational propulsion theory, allowing a mass exodus from Earth. Plan B is a conventional launch of the Endurance spacecraft with 5,000 frozen embryos to colonize a habitable planet and ensure humanity's survival. Cooper is recruited to pilot the Endurance and accepts against Murphy's wishes. When she refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch to compare their relative time when he returns.
The crew consists of Cooper, the robots TARS and CASE, and the scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Prof. Brand's daughter), Romilly, and Doyle. After traversing the wormhole, Cooper, Doyle, and Brand use a lander to investigate Miller's planet, where time is severely dilated. After landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from Miller's expedition, a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle and waterlogs the lander's engines. By the time the lander's engines restart, they discover that 23 years have elapsed on the Endurance. Having enough fuel only for one of the other two planets, they vote to go to Mann's, as he is still broadcasting.
En route, they receive messages from Earth. Murphy Cooper is now a scientist working on Plan A. On his deathbed, Prof. Brand revealed to her that Plan B was his only real plan, knowing that Plan A was not feasible without observations of gravitational singularities from within a black hole.
At Mann's planet, they revive him from cryostasis. He assures them colonization is possible despite an extreme environment. On an excursion, Mann attempts to kill Cooper and reveals that he falsified the data in the hope of being rescued. He steals Cooper's lander and heads for the Endurance. While a booby trap set by Mann kills Romilly, Brand rescues Cooper with the other lander and they race to the Endurance. Mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging the Endurance. Through a difficult docking maneuver, Cooper regains control.
With insufficient fuel, they resort to a slingshot around Gargantua. In the process, Cooper and TARS must jettison their lander to allow Brand and CASE to reach Edmunds' planet. Falling into the event horizon of Gargantua, they find themselves in a tesseract, possibly constructed by humans in the far future. Cooper can see through the bookcases of Murphy's room on Earth, across time, and weakly interact with its gravity. He realizes that he is now (and was) Murphy's "ghost". He uses Morse code to manipulate the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her before he left, giving Murphy the quantum data that TARS collected, which she needs to solve Brand's gravitational equations.
The tesseract, its purpose completed, collapses and ejects Cooper and TARS. Cooper wakes on a huge station orbiting Saturn. He reunites with his daughter, now an old woman nearing death, who was able to develop the gravitational propulsion theory. Murphy reminds Cooper that Amelia Brand is out there alone. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Brand and CASE, who are setting up a human colony on Edmunds' habitable planet.

I can understand the frustration. I too feel like "uuh not again". but at the same time, things are so hectic right now, that I wouldn't crucify anyone for making a simple question. chill &amp; hodl
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:33:33
this. people wait for far too long, only to say, "damn now its even more expensive to get in". small amounts, have a feel, wait couple of days. or dont, and forever wonder what it is like to own a piece of history. Ive seen several proud 16/17k owners. people say "volatility" but then show big surprise when the volatility shows itself. but what do I know, im just a noob.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:21:59
hey, I "feel you" but I just don't understand why you feel you need to "warn" people. you could simply say you are having a nightmare of an experience. If I used kraken and was happy and joyful and making money, why would I change? is there a security breach? I've read crazy stuff about other exchanges being hacked and coming back into play. those are the ones I run away from. like I said, bad experience, change to something else
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:00:27
to be honest, sometimes it does sound like a piramid scheme. ill probably get downvoted for saying this, but i mean, other than a couple very well put attn posts, this sub is like "to the moon" "i bought a house/car" "will reach [place big amount here] by end of year" "will drink a bootle of whatever if reaches XX". to be honest these cause mix feelings and they dont sound like something that defends bitcoin and the ideologies behind it. will gladly accept arguments about this
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:51:13
I'm glad you speak on behalf of everyone xD I'm not saying it's good or bad, but come on, between the time you posted and now there is at least one reply saying they never had a problem. mind you, all exchanges are going through record breaking usage levels due to mainstream getting in. don't like kraken? switch to coinbase or whatever. but don't expect to find the perfect exchange where everything is nice and cosy and works 100% of the time
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:12:25
don't wanna sound like a dick but this topic has came up over and over again. sure you can't find a answer?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:34:03
so you're saying, "everyone stop using kraken because you are losing money?" yeah... right, I'm sure people in here are unaware they are losing money.
took 2 weeks to get validated at coinbase, lost the 9k-14k uprise and you don't see me posting "dont use coinbase"
and no I'm not going to read any posts, I'm just posting an opinion about a kind of post title I'm not fun of. I'll use kraken if I want to unless you show me some kind of security compromise. kraken is not the only one suffering ddos.
it feels like you should be trying to contact kraken support other then ranting about it (although I agree ranting can be good to give visibility)
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:25:44
someone is triggered. i have many friends using kraken. good or bad they are not rushing to change. people think others must agree with everything or they stupid. makes total sense. if it makes u feel better to insult and say random rude things, be my guest
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:18:48


welcome to the club. there are thousands, possibly millions of people joining the bitcoin rush everyday and companies can't keep up. if you need support, you are very much screwed. just keep trying, look for phone numbers or smth I guess. coinbase is not much different, although I think it's one of the safest to rely on atm
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:15:57
does it really matter if we're talking about USD or EUR or GBP?
someone said this, which I liked so I'm quoting:
"Coinbase is insured to hacks of their wallet, but not unauthorized access to your account."
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:30:57
this is my next problem. I want to put coins in ledger but I also want to do small amounts of trading. afraid sending currency from/to ledger is going to drown me in fees
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:46:59
the thing is, every time you generate a key, it give's an address that could by someone's address. just because there are say 1.000 values doesn't mean that it will take me 1.000 tries, I can get it first try, 10th try, etc. (?)

@_date: 2017-12-14 17:12:18
I was actually verified on a 1€ deposit. wondering if they changed the rules of the game (it does sound like it from that message)
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:12:34
Im a noob. but realizing we screw up is an enormous step. we can make stupid decisions everyday, but if we make them on our own rational decision, is one thing, making decisions based on the thoughts of a subset of users is not good.
hopefully we can all learn from this.
thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:42:03
simple and efficient, i like it. would also check out how secure the private keys are (or arent, wink wink)
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:19:02
I think I should move everything to my ledger :p thing is the back and forth apparently comes with a lot of fees, so leaving stuff in exchanges is useful :/ not sure if the fact that they (bitstamp) might be more secure now makes me feel more comfortable about them. who's to say it wasn't an inside job?
then again, coinbase, having so much traffic, can easily have a big target on their backs atm
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:23:04
this is not so much about it being safe &amp; reliable, but more what would happen if hackers did steal all their money. I've read that the fiat is insured but crypto is not (although it is kept on cold storage). anyway, this doesn't change the fact that I am currently more afraid of bitfinex and bitstamp than coinbase, at least in terms of them having an internal hack.
but yeah, what is true today might not be tomorrow
