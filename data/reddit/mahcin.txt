Yeah, he never fails to disappoint. The guy is a legend.
Even with crypto, where he could easily do it wrong and make a cringy episode, he absolutely killed it. Couldn't be any better :)

I’m sorry, but this is exactly the type of comments I’m talking about. No facts, no sign of research, not even acknowledging the fact that there is also a possibility of going to zero. Just look at the graph! We had so many crashes and we always recovered, this is no different! Buy buy buy!
I have invested in crypto and am planning to invest a lot more in the upcoming months, possibly years. I honestly do believe that there is a big future in crypto and people who invest in the right projects will be very well off in a couple of years time. 
But I am not going around telling people to do the same. There are safer investment alternatives to crypto and everyone should decide for themselves where their money goes. Yes all my investment money is in crypto, but I am still very skeptical.
The point I’m trying to make is that instead of spamming comments like I mentioned above, have a discussion! Look at the good and bad. And when you advise people to buy, also let them now about the risks! Not just “dude, look at the graph and buy”

Forgot about one more bullet point
-	Clueless people who think they’re investment professionals because they bought some [insert crypto name] and are now giving terrible financial advice
And to people who regularly post on this subreddit reading this comment, if you think this doesn’t apply to you, there’s probably over 90% chance you’re wrong. It applies to you. Very much. If you wrote “just hodl” or “yay cheap coins” (or really anything similar) when there was a dip, you’re one of those people.

Quite possibly the most accurate one as well.

Was in Barcelona a few days back and was positively surprised at how much I saw crypto mentioned.
There’s even a “crypo café”. Not sure what it is but I can only assume that you can buy coffee with crypto.

Yes, there is a solid chance

I'm not from US so there's no such thing as 401k, or at least not something similar that I've heard of.
I'm currently employed as a student, which is a special employment status in my country that gives great benefits when being employed at a young age, such as much lower taxes, unlimited holidays etc.
That basically means that the only thing I get out of working is the monthly salary, no more and no less. What I decide to do with that money is up to me, I don't have to worry about doing taxes and so on.
That's great because it gives me financial stability and freedom at a young age. I'll worry about "401k" or whatever the equivalent is in my country once I'm a full time employee. Until then...100% into crypto! :D

I am 100% in crypto. It's my savings account.
I am 22 years old with no other bills to pay but rent, gas,  food and clothes. And a bit of traveling from time to time.
I know this is an unpopular opinion, but if there's any point in time when I can afford to be reckless with money, it's right now. 
And it may either backfire, in which case it won't hurt me much because I'm financially secure (no debt whatsoever, very solid salary for my age), or it will pay off BIG. Either way, I see no downside. If I lose my savings, I'll tell myself I at least gave it a shot.
Here's how I see it: I can have about $10k in savings account in 2 years time and that's about it. Or I risk losing those $10k for a possibility of owning my own freaking exotic car and a house in 2 years at age of 24. Totally fucking worth it IMO.
Of course for someone who has his own family to provide for or debt, it's very, very stupid and reckless to go all in.

Whatever you want to call it :) I think we both have the same thing in mind.

I see someone already suggested GDAX, but another thing you might want to take a look at is BitStamp.
Not sure for US, but for people from EU, Bitstamp is the cheapest option regarding fees. I bought 500€ worth of BTC last week and I paid less than 1€ in fees.

Haha, exactly. Every time any crypto I own dips, I'm not even sad, I'm just like *welp, gotta get some more at discounted price now!*

Just a friendly advice...if you are thinking about getting into BTC...GET IN IT NOW.
I had the same mentality as you...welp it's $200, no point in investing...welp it's $900, seriously no point in investing...welp it's $2400...and it goes on.
So I finally said fuck it and basically threw all my savings (that I can afford to lose) into it a couple of months back. Well my savings are worth 8% more now and I know it will only go up from here.
And if you're still afraid to get into it, here's another advice. BTC fork is coming up in less than a month and there will probably be a decent dip in price when that happens. Read up, educate yourself regarding BTC and buy it when the dip happens. It will only grow stronger after that, it always does.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:04:44
Well, the problem is that you never really know what is the lowest point.
So if BTC (or same with stock I assume) simply keeps falling downwards from 5700, you never know when it's going to go back up again. And even if the price does go back up for a couple of minutes, how can you be sure that it won't just turn back down and fall more?
Predicting these prices/graphs is literally impossible, no computer can do it. 
So once the price graph starts falling, it's all a matter of luck. The longer you wait, the bigger are chances of you missing the lowest point because it might go back up a lot before you buy. And on the contrary, the sooner you buy the dip, the bigger are chances that the price will keep lowering. 
I personally usually set a "goal price" in my head and once it dips to that point, I buy.
