When you use adblock, it keeps an empty div, with this extension, it removes the element from the page and stretches the chart. This extension was made on 4-12-13 and performed well, until some asshole got hands on my password and uploaded this btc stealing code. Anyway, those who want can check the code. It is clean with no hidden stuff inside. Feel free to evaluate.

The code has been cleaned out.
Apparently my google account was hacked and someone uploaded this fake "update".
My account password has been changed and a clean version of the plugin was uploaded to the chrome store again.

I'm really sorry for those who have lost any bitcoins with this. I hope it wasn't much.

There is even more than only "portals" on the [darknet](
But for some place like [bitcointalk]( i guess the stuff like [I2P]( and [Freenet]( are somewhat difficult to reach for non tech people. [Osiris]( can be configured with Isis, a gateway, so other portals can also be reached. Wich can probably be configured to limited access to predefined portals. This way [bitcointalk.org]( could easilly be used to access a new dimension in the web.
Personally i guess this has a lot of potential.

Therefore i prefer i2p wich enables you to use regular websites, just as you would on a usual server or one connected trough tor; but for this task i think being decentralized is the most important part, witch i2p and tor are not, at least the webserver and its data are not.
Freenet is way to difficult and "Dark" for the regular user, whereas Osiris is much simpler in usage and has no bad reputation for being a darknet (i think)...
