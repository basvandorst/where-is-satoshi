wow if this account situation couldn’t get any worse, now Morgan is going to fuck up their clients portfolios by selling them what’s now their own version of btc and I bet they won’t even get into the gritty details with the clients. rather persuade them just like Wells did with all those extraneous accounts they got clients to open up . 
if anyone is going to go forward with this company specifically seriously be careful; these professional bois aren’t the same as a regular coin service

I guess i'm wondering if countries will eventually see cryptocurrency as utility and necessary to regulate

Hi i do not know much about bitcoin but a bit about economics. Doesn't this market seem like a huge potential to plunge once the bubble bursts? Also, I feel as though consumer surplus is actually reduced and there are ridiculous amount of power that go into mining. Again i'm in no way against, Im just wondering if these things are possible outcomes from someone more informed

this may sound stupid, but is there a capacity constraint of some sort that a currency has that makes it less desirable? i guess i'm not sure the difference between btc, eth, and neo

Thank you! I want to learn more. Do you feel that bitcoin has monopolized the cryptocurrency market though?
