I don't actually run it at that clockspeed.  I run it at stock and undervolt the hell out of it, it gets around 540 MH/s but barely puts out any heat at all.

No, he can't.  
  
It happend to me, they don't give a shit.  I called their customer support line and they said they don't cover sellers for "those types of items", they consider it the same as selling WoW Gold.

I was scammed as well, for one bitcoin back when they were about $8-$10 each.  Nothing near your 2k though, sorry to hear that!  
  
This will hurt for your to read, as it nearly hurts for me to type it, but paypal won't do a damned thing because they don't cover this type of transaction.  To them, it's the same as selling gold in WoW.

I'll admit I bought it on impulse to replace my twin GTX570's for gaming... I had been eyeing it for several weeks, but when I saw the hashrate people were getting with it my twisted hardware-addicted mind justified the price by telling myself I'll pay it off with bitcoins.  
  
I still don't know if BF3 performs better or worse with this card than it did with the GTX570's, I only had BF3 for one day before I switched.

I don't know the news story they're talking about, but it sounds like it means when they first opened they faked lots of bitcoin trades to make people think others were trading with them to make them think "well if other people are doing it, it must be safe, so I'll do it too"
@_date: 2012-01-06 05:18:42
You can't be serious - that $20-$30 apiece price was a result of a incredibly sharp, short, spike of publicity.  It corrected itself rather quickly as well.  
  
Who's to say where it will climb back to, but dno't hold your breath for those exorbitant prices again anytime soon.
@_date: 2012-03-17 05:07:15
Many of us have been scammed with PayPal, luckily myself for only 1 bitcoin worth.  However I just saw a story here in about a week or so ago with a guy that lost about $2000 worth of bitcoins.  
  
Paypal really sucks for this type of transaction.

Yes I noticed it on a Saturday, which is why I said I would wait 48 hours before saying anything about it to anyone if it wasn't refunded. I know things can take time, especially on the weekend.  It was his reply that totally disregarded what I said ("There was no double transaction, please give us more of your money.") that pushed me to post it here.  
  
Also, of course I considered it might be Dwolla who's at fault.  As a customer, should I care?  Or do you think that maybe MtGox should contact Dwolla first before they subtract money from someone's account? If they took money out of your account and it was negative when you logged in, would you think "Oh, no big deal, it's probably Dwolla's fault that Mt.Gox debited my acount so much it's negative, LOL!"
@_date: 2012-02-25 23:57:10
So, it takes 60 minutes to confirm a transaction, yet you received your order in 45 minutes ?  
  
Isn't the business technically taking a risk by sending the food before 6 blocks have been generated and the transaction shows as confirmed?
@_date: 2012-02-15 05:35:59
I actually don't know, I can't get the memory to do what I want like I can with the 58xx cards.  I think it actually doesn't matter on this card, but I'm not 100% sure.  
  
Edit: Before anyone asks, I've tried TriXX and Afterburner (locked and unlocked) and most of the time I can't get the RAM to go below 975-1000 MHz (it varies based on the core clock).  It's really weird in that sometimes the ram does exactly what I want, but I have no idea what causes it... it happened after a long day of overclocking and undervolting, and of course many driver crashes.  I'm just gonna say that the RAM is weird, and maybe when real 7970 drivers come out and updated overclocking tools are released things will change.
@_date: 2012-03-19 14:22:52
Thank you Adam. The only reason I posted here was because the reply I received made me feel like I was an invisible user against a large company.  I stated that I didn't receive the claimed double transaction (also, that was nearly a *year* ago! come on!) and the reply made me feel like you didn't care.  I couldn't think of any other course of action that would guarantee the money was returned.  If I misjudged, then I do apologize.

This is what I bought since it was cheap and has 4 PCIE slots  
  
  
Although it shows deactivated now.  I recommend searching for AM3 or AM3+ motherboards with 4 PCIE slots, then buy the cheapest Sempron you can find.  
  
Then get some PCIE x1-&gt;x16 extenders from Cablesaurus  (or I can sell you mine, since I just sold my last mining card)
@_date: 2012-02-26 00:05:52
It probably wasn't a botnet.  It could be simple, like the ebay user bought the coins, paid with his normal paypal account, then hid the coins off on a USB stick wallet.  Then, "wtf is this I never bought this! - I want a refund!"  
  
Nobody can prove he received the coins.  
  
Worse, nobody will even try to prove it, paypal will say they don't cover this type of item.  I know because I was scammed this way as well.
@_date: 2011-06-09 04:11:07
Yeah, it was right when I decided to try my hand at a little day-trading.  
Right when the market started going down a bit I tried selling 2 coins, kept getting error messages over and over and over as I watched the market falling and falling.  
Thank jeebus it was only with 1-2 bitcoins, because if someone had been playing with hundreds, they'd be pissed.  
  
Is this it?  
@_date: 2011-06-09 04:53:48
Yeah.  You don't gotta buy a case.  
 
But on a serious note, you have the structural soundness of a case (can be picked up and moved as a whole) without spending money on a case, or trapping heat inside.
@_date: 2011-06-08 04:15:46
The main problem I see with bitcoins is for people trying to actually further the economy and accepting bitcoins at their stores/websites - the price fluctuates so incredibly wildly that there's no way for them to post a price on their goods!  Every single website would have to have functions in their HTML to divide by the exchange rate at that very second to display the proper BTC price, then upon refreshing the page, the BTC price would change.  
  
Having said that, I'm loving the hell out of mining 'em ;)

I had a nice brand new 5830 (the extreme edition that everyone's raving about on the bitcoin forums, that's getting sold for $50 over newegg price) that burned up two days ago after only two weeks of mining.  I'm a sad panda.  Trying to get in touch with newegg about a replacement now.

Sorry I forgot to mention that I definitely am pooling it!  
Also I just switched programs from the rpcminer-4way.exe to bitcoin-miner.exe and my Core-i5 went from 7500 to 15000.  It *doubled* by just switching programs.  That makes me really want to tweak all the CUDA and OpenCL settings that the readme says can fine-tune performance.  The fact that I can't find any tweaking guides even with my Google-Fu makes me think people are keeping them secret to themselves ;)
@_date: 2011-06-08 03:55:24
I did the exact same thing, only starting with it being $7 each.  I've been selling about one bitcoin per day since then.  
  
I'm not kicking myself too hard though, since we actually need the money that day to help buy family things, and mainly because you never know if it's about to crash to a buck per coin 30 minutes from now.

My g/f and him just left for a two week vacation in Arkansas, but I think I do have some videos we recorded of it a few weeks ago.  He's good at it, actually. He's also much better at Borderlands than my gf is, and if given a decently equipped character you could play online with him and not know you're playing with a 3 year old
@_date: 2011-06-25 04:54:52
if this is it - "Center for the Study of Systems Biology at the Georgia Institute of Technology" then apparently you have Opteron CPU's, not gpu's...
If you really do have lots of GPU's, first find out how efficently they run OpenCL, and note that AMD GPU's are about 3-6x faster than NVidia GPU's currently.

I'd be interested in a basic buying and selling bot as well, I know there are some python bots listed on the forums, but I don't know python.  I know C++ but nobody uses it apparently.  If I knew how to program websockets and tcp/ip I would write my own.

I would have been the exact same way if I didn't have a family of 3 to support/feed by myself.  
Since I do have that, I was limited in what I could devote to mining coins, but I do have about 850-950 MH/s depending on what hardware is currently on and if my 3.5 year old is playing games (the hashrate drops while he plays)
@_date: 2011-06-26 03:13:25
I don't get what the whole linux mining craze is all about, I've been mining on my whole house's win7 boxes and haven't had any issues; the only time I can see switching to linux is when you need to use more than 4 gpu's per motherboard
@_date: 2011-06-09 04:48:40
He plays Bulletstorm and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.  (To be fair, he's 3.5)  
  
And there's nothing you can do about the hashrate dropping, of course it's gonna drop while a game is using the GPU!  
  
As for the aggression, I had to tweak it so as not to interfere with the games, for the 5850 it's AGGRESSION=4, for the 4870 it's AGGRESSION=3
@_date: 2011-06-22 21:42:50
I just realized I had it (in one of my gmail subfolders, hidden) too after I read Grogtastic's post
@_date: 2011-05-21 15:47:46
Because when people realized that large clusters of fpga miners have started coming online they either got mad, scared, or lost faith in mining (even though at this point they're way more expensive than gpu's, but 10x more power efficient)  
  
Also, probably more importantly, it was obvious it was in a bubble and would go down eventually.   I'm kicking myself for not selling the 6 I mined for 6.90 when I had the chance 2 days ago (I think I put like 7.25 as min price on mtgox)

@_date: 2011-06-26 03:27:23
I suppose.  I've just had so many negative experiences trying to install video drivers in the past with Linux, that even thinking about trying to mine on it gives me a headache.  I love me some Windows mining.  Make a batch file to run phoenix, double click and away you go.  GPU overclocking looks to be much easier as well (judging by the fact that the bitcoin mining forum is filled with people asking for help with overclocking / installing drivers in linux)

sure it's going up now (actually it topped at 28.67, now it's back down to 26) but who's to say that 30 minutes after I log out and go to bed, there's a crash to a dollar per coin while I'm sleeping?  I'd wake up to coins that cost me more to mine than I could sell for, and THEN I'd be kicking myself.

Core-i5 750 @ 3 GHz [Nehalem] , 7500 khash/s  
GTX 570 @ 750 MHz [Fermi]  , 112200 khash/s

5850 @ 775 MHz [Cypress] , 176000 khash/s  
  
I still have a running e8400 and a single-core conroe-celeron (slow) that I haven't fired up the cpu-rpcminer on because I figured they **definately** wouldn't be worth the power cost of running them full-tilt.
