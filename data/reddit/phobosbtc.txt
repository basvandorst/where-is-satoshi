have you looked around the blockchain to all the connected addresses to the ones you send to / the ones that send back to you? you can learn a lot looking at transaction history. if you DM me some the the addresses I would love to have a look

I think we can all agree. Dogecoin has the most intrinsic value

The difficulty of the network adjusts if the blocks start being found too fast or too slow. This happens every 2 weeks or so. Overall were slightly less than 10 min per block average because of the mining power that gets added before the readjustment. But every 2 weeks the network changes difficulty based on how long it took to find the last 2 weeks worth of blocks. Pretty sure it's 2016 blocks

make sure you are searching hidden files as well. try typing %appdata% in your file explorer address bar. from there look for folders like bitcoin / litecoin, if you find a wallet.dat file in there, hope its not encrypted.

never use a public block explorer
a transaction hits the network
moments later your IP connects to an explorer and looks up the transaction
your IP is now highly suspected of owning that address
do this for any 2 transactions with a shared history from the same IP and its you for sure
your name is already connected to your IP in so many data bases
congrats, you are rekt

Bit pay is anti bitcoin and they not only push Bcash but force you to use their wallet to buy anything with their invoices. When some other wallet does the work to be compatible with bitpay garbage invoices, bitpay will update and break the other wallets functionality
BITPAY IS NOT BITCOIN

its good luck to burn satoshis in the genesis block, doge bless
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:16:10
first and most important point. blockchain.info and blockchain.com are EVIL, avoid using them for storing coins or looking up addresses in the future. bitcoin.com as well, dont use it or go to it.
OK now learning time. The way this wallet works is your wallet info is stored encrypted on their servers, your password is used to decrypt the wallet locally(in your browser) so you can spend the coins. 
The private key associated with the wallet can be used to restore the exact same addresses on any other similar wallet. So in order to access your coins you need to enter your recovery seed in to a compatible wallet. electrum app on your phone should be fine.
security time. the above long post has tons of great info, read it over a couple times at least, but it got 1 thing wrong. Once you restore your wallet and regain access to your coins, you should create an entirely new wallet to send them to and store them. dont restore your seed on to a hardware wallet, one of the best things about hardware wallets is they generate the seed without being plugged in to anything so you can be 100% sure your recovery seed has never touched the internet in any way.
1. download a new wallet from app store(electrum)
2. use the restore your seed option
3. get a hardware wallet and set it up
4. send the coins from electrum to the hardware wallet
5. hodl
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:01:47
you should be able to load the seed in to a different wallet and restore it. ditch blockchain all together
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:35:17
hopefully something here can help
you should remove mentions of why you bought 
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:55:51
it wouldn't have the same addresses but you can use the same seed when you make your multi sig wallet. but you shouldnt. 
Also are you really sure you want to make a 2 of 2 with yourself? it just makes things more complex and that makes it easier to mess up.
Instructions on making a 2 of 3 with other people, adjust as needed
1 create new electrum multsig segwit wallet with 2 of 3
2. Confirm your seed
3. Copy your xpub
4. Close wallet\
5. Paste xpub in chat
6. Wait for all 3 xpubs to be pasted in chat
7. Open electrum
8. Create new multisig wallet
9. Restore from seed
10. Add the other 2 xpubs
11. Complete wallet creation
12. Post the receiving address of the wallet
13. We all check that we got the same address
14. Test transaction

each buyer has a seller yes... but generally shorts and longs are also borrowing... so each of these orders represent and equal order in the opposite direction that will need to happen... right now way more people are committed to buying bitcoin in the near future than are committed to selling... this tends to happen all at once when the market starts to move again people they all panic close their orders at the same time and the price shoots in the other direction

I was thinking the same thing recently. My new goal is to never verify with an exchange again. Living in Vancouver makes this possible but the extra fees are annoying. Now we have 3 Lamassu, 1 robocoin, and 1 exchange, its only a matter of time before the fees become extremely competitive.

There is a log in him saying something like "us gov doesn't want us to say" from back in nov. Then you have to consider Charlie and Silk Road. He was arrested because bit instant was used by people who sent btc to sr. Now Charlie's business model was this. Keep his gox act funded, people give him money, he moves money from his gox acct to theirs. I honestly believe mark is going down hard for sr related reasons. Also that leaked doc is bs, that cold wallet leak line pretty much discredits the whole thing and people have tracked Dow something like 500k coins in gox related wallets.

When doing the attack where you dont submit solved blocks to the pool, selfish mining I think? do you still get to solve the block and keep all of the reward? I'm thinking since you have the answer then you just submit separately correct?

I dont understand why. I think the fact that they dont need to understand it to use a service like his is a big selling point. It should be a simple case of getting someone set up with just another payment method. Once it is set up, the person accepting it never needs to hear the word bitcoin again, they just get money in their account when sales happen.

If you are willing to spend 1-5 hours learning and another few hours redownloading every time you update to the newer ios it is 100% worth it because all apps become free and you can do funky stuff, 5 icons instead of 4 per row is prob the most useful mod you can do

would things like coin join allow more transactions to fit in the same block with less size? or would it just be less overall transactions with more larger transactions?
on a similar note if 10 people used coin join would it effect the fee needed to get it in the next block. ie 10 people each send their own transaction they all need their own fee, but with coin join 10 people share a transaction, how do fees work in this situation.
might as well add in another. Does coin join offer anything to people who dont care about being anon, is there any other incentive to use it?

So the reason my elder daughter only has a 5 and the younger had 100 is because I was talking to the guy who runs the ATM and she scanned the QR and put the money in the machine while we weren't paying attention

they fixed the retroactive thing, but they still have the policy that after 6 months leaving your coins there they take a monthly fee.
I asked the CEO about this policy at a meet up this was his response
We dont want people holding coins in our exchange because we are not a bitcoin bank. He also said that people should have read the terms of service

 The data shown in this file is obtained through the public domain, no hacking or alike was involved.
 
Here's the transfer data from the 'BITCOIN SUB FUND'
"The Bitcoin sub-fund was incorporated as a Bermuda exempted company and is registered as a segregated account company receiving funds at Citibank London."
 
The fund obtained 80,000BTC at an average cost-base of $40. Press announcement on the 8th of March 2013 (FORBES.COM). The MtGox 'Willy' show started the 14th of February 2013. How convenient!

End stats: The fund has fully unwielded their position in the strangest way ever. They made about 37M for investing 3M. Sure it's theoretically possible they made purchases too, but if so, why the constant 999,099 withdrawals? How did they call a top without knowing Willy did it? How did anyone trade this perfectly?
 
It does take more Willy Report insight to see if this matches up. This account is certainly interesting.

not bad really. Even with 3-4 ATMs in vancouver 5% bitstamp seems to be the norm, I bought recently from a new atm that was virtex 3% but I believe it was changing to 5% soon and the 3% was because it was new.
Congrats on the ATM

"We often see that when a new and little-understood opportunity like Bitcoin presents itself, scammers will find ways to capitalize on the public’s excitement and interest,” said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “We’re pleased the court granted our request to halt this operation, and we look forward to putting the company’s ill-gotten gains back in the hands of consumers.”
Back to consumers you say, wonder what the process will be. Like what about to people who were shipped units 6 months late? clearly they got scammed as well but technically they "got what they paid for"
This should be fixed "While more Bitcoins are being mined each day, the total number of Bitcoins available to mine is reduced in half each year."

I like this idea, I'm sure there would be a way for it to be made with open source software so everyone could check the code. Something like 1 mbtc per entry, winner take all.

funny thing, my idea was will 100 dollars today pay for college in 20 years
I've used waves one a few times as well, they are both pretty simple. Only weird thing about the Robocoin is that you need to select how much you want to buy, but it doesn't matter what you select, it just gives you how ever much money you put in worth.
What most people don't know about the hand scanner is that it was turned off on like day 1 and never turned back on.
best thing about having 2 ATMs in the city is now the fees will have to be competitive. 
Also everyone should watch the last 6 seconds of the video, I think I an going to make that in to a vine later
edit: other differences are this one doesnt print the paper wallet for you, but it does get you your bitcoins faster because it doesn't rely on the exchange to send them. It keeps a hot wallet loaded then restocks itself from an exchange
edit2: removing a line from above because it looks like robo lowered fee to 2% a while back. I might shoot an email to both companys and then make a new post giving exact details on both ATMs if I get time

So I was hosting the doge booth, I did it for fun and honestly it went great. I was extremely busy the whole time and didn't only talk about doge. I talked about doge, BTC, and crypto in general. As it turns out I'm pretty good at answering crypto questions for any level of understanding. Having a doge booth there didnt confuse people, it intrigued them and got them talking about crypto and asking questions. This went much better than I expected to and I taught so many curious people so much about crypto that day. You quite literally posted an article about coinfest being bad while it was still going.
i think some things in your post need to be corrected, maybe more than a few things. 
The "art and trade show" was not coinfest, if was just the first of 4 events that day. So saying coinfest was bad based on an art and trade show is wrong. Then you say "3. Pick a focus for the event. Is this an art show, an alternative society movement or a promotion and celebration of Bitcoin." this was the art and trade show portion of coinfest.
So you take a picture of a guy in a crazy jacket asking me questions and use that to say that we are clearly not being serious. The guy in the crazy jacket was just there, he had nothing to do with dogecoin.
Andrew was there but he was hosting an event that takes place in 4 locations in 1 day, so after like 2 o'clock he left to make sure the other venues were in order.
you also said he calls himself a creative visionary, that is incorrect, he never called himself that.
The bitcoin POS terminal was there, hosted by coinkite, how did you miss it? it was to the right of me at the end of the row of tables.
why did you provide that link but not a link to the actual coinfest website ? 
Vancouver has an amazing Bitcoin scene. I already knew it before this weekend but being a part of it took my understanding to a whole new level.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that a person posting under the name sadbitcoiner is writing negative articles. I may have to write an article in the next few days about the success of this event. But I have a crazy doge party video to put together and I want to do it asap.

Encouraging spending is a non issue. I dont understand why people think that no one will buy things if they can buy more of something later instead. We always use credit cards and thats exactly whats happening.

with a normal wallet you have an address and anyone who gets that address by either sending you BTC, receiving BTC from you, or some other means, can now see who you sent BTC to, when you sent it, how much, basically your entire transaction history.
Dark wallet uses 2 main features, 1 time address and coin join. With dark wallet you never use the same address twice, this makes it harder to see all of your activity. Coin join is a little more complex to explain in text so I'll give an example. 
10 people(group A) want to send bitcoin to 10 other people(Group B) . Instead of 10 transactions, dark wallet sends bitcoin from every person in group A, to every person in group B. It does math and makes sure every person gets the right amount, but this way its extremely hard to figure out exactly who sent money where.
Disclaimer : i think I'm right about everything I typed, but not sure enough to not put this disclaimer

take the time to learn about bitcoin. Then when your ready, buy from somewhere that doesnt require giving personal information(unless large buy then really no choice) next move your bitcoin to wasabi wallet and start mixing it to break any link to where you got it from. If you sell back to Fiat ever you should pay tax on profits but never ever reveal your addresses
@_date: 2019-03-15 16:59:51
pretty sure they hit a bunch of ATMs that were paying out 0 conf
@_date: 2019-03-22 17:25:56
coinbase will go out of their way to report, pay your taxes and never sell back to fiat again

If you dont take privacy steps then with very little work anyone can know everything about your holdings and spending habits. An analogy I like is, not taking these steps is the equivalent of handing over your entire banking / credit history every time you transact. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 22:52:05
make sure to learn the difference between types of wallets. If you are not using a wallet that gives you the private keys to your public address then you do not have full control over your coins

you should just stop using that wallet instead. Bitpay has always been a predatory company in the space, avoid them at all costs

51% hash power does not let you make fake transactions, it lets you "double spend" thats where you spend coins, then use your hash power to rewrite the blockchain and send those same coins somewhere else.

I think there was one customer who would just ask every time and the management put it up as a joke. I base this on how I'm sure some of the people I ask are a bit sick of it. And just so everyone knows the phrase you ask is "do you take bitcoin yet?" and you should ask this every time you make an in person purchase at a smaller store or restaurant

Atomic swaps should never be done on minority hash rate chains or they will be double spent for sure, lightning doesn't change that in any way. Basically if your coin doesn't have the most hash rate of its algorithm it will and should be attacked.

Awesome thanks. I just created a new address, archived it, and the button appeared. Having a lot of fun messing around with stuff, I wish I could try out mining too but it seems I missed the boat on that one.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:06:54
the atm receipt said to sweep it immediately so I did when I imported it. Question about change, if I buy something with BTC does it always send the extra to a new address?
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:47:36
where is it? there isn't very many places to click in the app and I cant find it. Also thanks for the reply
