We need to stablish a group to share theories to solve the puzzle, ill start, if you match the numbers inside the circle that are same size 725,34 It formes a pentagram like in the davincis code, refearing to Leonardo davinci, its only a theory but the creator of the puzzle was inspired by coin_artist Who created a puzzle with a reference to a poem of Shakespeare...so may be a start . If u are reading this and finaly solve the puzzle Contact me with a prívate message i only want to know how You did It . 
Now its your turn, writte your theories down.

También intenté lo de ponerme bizco xd , lo del origami no lo entiendo creo que no es por ahí, creo que será más parecido a la otra adivinanza en la que están inspirados, en el sentido de que habrá una referencia y tras ella un camino
