Lol. One never knows. If they find out, the penalties can be severe if they think one has engaged in willful tax evasion.
Although this is not exactly tax, the IRS requires that foreign bank accounts that ever had over $10,000 in assets in the past year be reported. (The FBAR form.) If it isn't reported because you just didn't know, the fine is $10,000. (They don't charge, though, if you've reported on other forms and paid taxes on it and fulfilled other requirements.) 
"The IRS will not impose a penalty for the failure to file the delinquent FBARs if you properly reported on your U.S. tax returns, and paid all tax on, the income from the foreign financial accounts reported on the delinquent FBARs, and you have not previously been contacted regarding an income tax examination or a request for delinquent returns for the years for which the delinquent FBARs are submitted."
If you willfully not report and they find out, the fine can be up to $100,000 or half the account balances. If one has or had an account on Bitfinex, for example, and your investments one day rose over $10,000. The US government requires it be reported. I'd rather play it safe.

People need to know the answers to these questions. The IRS is not a pleasant organization to deal with if you don't follow its rules.
