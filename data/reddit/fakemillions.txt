.... the vast majority of bitcoin is held by a few and they could tank the markets right now if they wanted to.

You’re right about one thing. I don’t believe in a free market.

Wow you’re a fucking idiot. Blocked

....to say this without the hint of irony about BTC is RIDICULOUS.
If there is price manipulation, it's no more found in BTC than any other asset.

Bitcoin was invented 10 years ago.
Also like 100 people knew of bitcoin 10 years ago.

Is that why bitcoin tanked when mtgox stole the coins? Or bitcoin tanked when Coinbase went down for a little bit? 
Bitcoin is trustless but it’s price is not.

Government and bitcoin is the same thing. 
Both require trust to function. If there is no trust in either, they collapse.

So.. he.. is talking about 1/4th - 1/5th of the world economy in BTC.. in the near future.
Is this guy on drugs?

Maybe because USA is governed by religious idiots.

Privatization has ALWAYS been terrible for society.

They could tank the value overnight if they wanted to.
Coinbase could close up shop tonight and BTC would go down to 2013 levels.

Gold has existed for thousands of years and yet its MC is 7 trillion. This guy is talking about bitcoin having 3x the MC of gold in the near future. Granted, I cannot pay for my coffee / groceries in gold, but I cannot do so in bitcoin either and while bitcoin (and other crypto) is a new asset class, for someone to say that its asset class will rival major world power currencies in the near future is beyond ridiculous. 
The best that people can hope for is BTC dominance to be ~80% when crypto MC hits 1T.
