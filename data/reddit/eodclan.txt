Why is there no open comment feild or questions more focused on 'why i use' cryptos- the current survey's questions are all financial related, yet your stated goal:  " The goal of this research is to understand what drives people to use cryptocurrencies and it goes a lot beyond of the “I’m here for the money” or “I’m here for the technology”.
The reason i use cryptos is to dissolve the ability for the largest violence machine in history (Governments) which in turn will make violence (theft, murder,  etc.) nearly immesurable. Financial incentives are logical outcomes of freeing value exchange (currencies &amp; assets) from the grips of a violence apperatus like Government. So why do i use cryptos? to be free.
* Why not have a series of questions which ask about why one uses cryptos beyond financial incentives:
   * "Do you believe that freemarket currencies are suprior to Government issued currencies?"
   * "Are you trying to avoid (percieved \*being generous here for the Statists\*) theft by centralized fiat currency?"
   * "Do you find using CryptoCurrencies gives you more freedom in your ability to trade freely?"
Etc, etc. You are not tracking anything other financial motives with your current survey- not that i have issues with that, but it's not your stated goal &amp; furthermore missing the 2nd largest (by user-base) reason for cryptos: freedom.
