My uncle got a nice settlement years back. He went to buy a house with it. Literally tried to buy the house with cash, and the bank wouldn't let him.
Meanwhile, the government can literally fund terrorist and sell illegal firearms to drug cartels without reporting it.

5 percent of Turkey is in Europe, so that makes them Europeans I guess.

I'm not a slave, I go to work voluntarily so I can afford to do the things that make me happy. Anyone can leech of the system and have all their basic needs met and then some.

Giving people in poverty money has literally never brought anyone out of poverty.

Well statistically liberal art students have much lower IQs (by a large margin) than most other majors. Sure, you can't paint everyone with that brush, but if you had to guess, you would be correct more often than not going off that information. Additionally, income correlates with IQ much closer than with an individual's education level. High IQ liberal arts majors will statistically make more money than a low IQ engineering major.

It is a scary thought, but it has far more positives than negatives in the big picture, especially when it comes to reducing government power and corruption.

I do find that the average BTC buyer knows 1000x more about the market than 90 percent of people who have ever contributed to a 401k.

Literally the first comment:
"Firstly, let me wish you good luck. Second, let me tell you how much of an idiot you are."

I don't think that will ever happen again. We had a war over 1 percent tax increase just 200 years ago, now we gladly hand over half of our earnings in the name of roads.

I used my student loans to buy a motorcycle. Where else could someone get a stupid low interest loan (and no collateral) with no credit and no accumulated interest for 4 years?

Student loans are used for living expenses as well, not just tuition. Additionally, I paid my tuition out of pocket...so even if that were the case and I had to provide an invoice...it wouldn't matter in the slightest unless the bank was required to pay the school directly.
