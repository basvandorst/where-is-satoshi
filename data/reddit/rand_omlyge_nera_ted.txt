It will show it correctly once you enable advanced view: 
No idea why they're not showing it in the normal view. Just blockchain.info being blockchain.info I guess.

Having a Bitpay option shouldn't even be considered accepting Bitcoin to be honest.

Didn't I read something here lately about a Swiss bank rejecting someone for disclosing that they were going to use their bank account to deposit/withdraw from Bitcoin exchanges?

Because LN is not supposed to be a panacea, nor does it need to be. This narrow-minded all or nothing mentality many people seem to have in this discussion is tiring and counterproductive.
LN is not a solution to scaling Bitcoin, it's a solution to scaling one major use case: instant cheap payments. The infamous buying coffee use case. It achieves this by making the right trade-offs between security, censorship resistance and efficiency. This trade-off isn't a bug, it's a feature. 
The important thing here is that if LN is successful, it will demonstrate the advantages of a layered approach over trying to do everything on the inefficient blockchain layer. And it will hopefully open the door for similar developments that will also successfully leverage the Bitcoin blockchain for many other use cases.

Do you happen to have a link? Not because I don't believe you, I'd just like to read it.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:30:36
Can't argue with that :)
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:39:03
Maybe you're right. But wouldn't specialized sidechains be a better solution for that? Like Liquid for example. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:41:31
Different priorities and a rigorous testing process would be my guess.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:49:42
On-chain retail adoption is misguided. MS accepting bitcoin right now is little more than a novelty. At best it lends credibility to Bitcoin.

Someone moving 40k bitcoins to a Bech32 address has a pretty big signalling effect though. I know many people feel unsure about Segwit in general and Bech32 in particular, especially because the BitcoinCore wallet doesn't yet fully support it. Loaded's move was a huge vote of confidence in that regard.
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:46:45
Way more amazing than moving $400M for $1 is the fact that he was able to move that much money without anyone's permission. Cheap transactions are not what makes Bitcoin revolutionary, that's what most people and especially certain altcoiners don't want to understand.

It's called hyperbitcoinization.

I like your subtle sarcasm.

This is a Bitcoin sub. If you have to make retarded memes, at least make them about Bitcoin, and not "Crypto", which is just another word for bullshit at this point.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:30:03
No shit Sherlock!
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:25:09
Some people think everything related to Segwit is bad somehow. But that's not what I meant. People need to build up confidence that moving their bitcoins to a Bech32 address is indeed safe. Someone moving 40k btc to one definitely helps with that.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:27:59
People just ignore the counterparty risk that comes with trading on bucketshop shitcoin exchanges, because they're greedy. Don't be a greedy fool next time.

This spaced out twitter shit is unreadable.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:25:49
Why would that be so difficult to believe? I've put more than $50k into bitcoin over the years, and I wasn't super wealthy. People buy cars for more than that, knowing full well that it's a bad investment that already loses 20% of its value the moment you drive it out of the dealership's parking lot.

House money is an example of the sunk cost fallacy. There is no such thing as house money, this is your money now. Acting like it isn't is deluding yourself.

Don't ever use Bitpay. They overcharge on fees because it suits their big block agenda. Fuck these guys. If you're still using Bitpay after the 2X debacle you deserve to be fleeced by them.

No, this is clearly not your address. Pretty sure it belongs to some kind of exchange, as it's doing a lot of batched transactions.

Hmm, he seems like a really nice guy. Somehow I had pictured him much less likeable from reading his blogs and comments

It's a nice gesture, but pretending that investing $500 in bitcoin is going to let you pay off your student loans in a few years is still stupid, and a clear indicator of a bubble.

I used the word businesses for a reason too. They clearly follow their own interests.

He's not talking about you. He's talking about the (predominantly Chinese) mining businesses that are acting like they control Bitcoin.

It was already possible to pay with bitcoin via their donation address, it just wasn't automated and you had to message them your transaction ID and ask them to credit your account. I've always paid for my protonmail account this way, and from looking at their donation address, they either get a lot of donations, or I wasn't the only one: 
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:37:15
You guys realize that I'm talking about the expectation to pay off their student loans with it, right?
@_date: 2018-06-30 18:36:42
Oh nice, I didn't know this exists. I stopped using electrumx after their defaulting to bcash bullshit, so this looks like a great alternative.

From what I've read, there isn't going to be much Core development if 2X becomes the new de-facto Bitcoin. And if it doesn't, then it's irrelevant anyway, and the only thing to worry about is the confusion it might cause for users.

The craziest thing about this theory is that it kind of makes sense.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:08:04
Does anyone know at which fee level this is actually worth doing?
Because obviously it's only worth it if spending from a segwit address in the future will save me more than I paid for the transaction sending to the segwit address in the first place. And if the cost saving is close to zero, all you're doing is unnecesseraly bloating the blockchain...
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:42:11
Don't remember the exact amount but I think it was over 40 bitcoins.
