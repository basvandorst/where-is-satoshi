Is this going to be tied in with that Canadian coin which is more of a spy coin than anything?

Man, I really like the way you made comparisons to illustrate the ridiculousness of the statement.

Aye, I agree. But stores also hire loss prevention staff that hold thieves until police arrive. And that 120 pound female is probably backed up by a 210 pound bouncer. And even if they aren't it's not like they just allow it to happen, they call the police as it's in their best interest.
But I do agree with the general McAfee statement. The minting company isn't the ones going after crimes done with fiat currency. The police and other specialist agencies are. It would be somewhat ludicrous to hold Bitcoin accountable for it being used to buy guns. Especially knowing what we know about the CIA and how they used fiat to further the war of drugs

Here's a stupid question for y'all.
When buying Bitcoin from a seller, is it safe to put the Bitcoin directly onto my ledger wallet?
@_date: 2019-11-12 12:28:37
Are you calling the past 11 years a beta?

The ledger comes with a lanyard and wrist bracelet, both of which look so flimsy I wouldn't trust them with a 4gb thumb drive. Let alone keys, let alone crypto!

Allow me to finish that last sentence for you

I think that's why they do it. The optimists put optimism behind the word "drama" and the pessemists put negativity behind the word "drama" meaning you got both sides biting out of your cookie.
It's scummy, but it works. They don't write these articles to not be read so you gotta maximize potential as the ever increasing void screams louder and louder with other, infinitely various clickbait bullshit to grab eyeballs.

Uhh read up on that "Canada coin." They want it to track the way crypto is used. Sounds like a spy coin to me in a way.

Looks good, but how does it function? And maybe more importantly, what do you think? What's your first impressions of the device?
@_date: 2019-12-09 13:31:51
I believe he meant that more in jest.
@_date: 2019-12-11 23:58:03
What does he mean by that "not really using Bitcoin"? I enjoyed your write up on the difference between storing your coins on a ledger versus a full node.
@_date: 2019-12-08 09:23:21
So this isn't a government enforced law or anything that the exchanges have to give you your private keys or make you generate your own private keys to use on their exchange. But instead it's just a yearly coordinated group effort to withdraw your coins on a certain day to see if your chosen exchange flops?
Any statistics or analytics to go along with this "yearly" tradition? Surely we should be able to see an effect if it's effective.
@_date: 2019-12-08 08:58:52
So this "exchange proof of keys" thing. Why will it be the "end of exchanges?" I'm being cautious and removing my trading sum just incase it ends up being a big snafu. But I would like to know why people think it will be a snafu.
Here's hoping it's much ado about nothing. I think we can agree that would be better than people running around like their hair is on fire.
Okay I read up on it. It's just a coordinated group effort to remove funds from an exchange to see if the exchange actually has all the Bitcoin they claim and if they shut down the exchange due to all the withdrawals or what. 
Here I thought it was a government bill of some sort mandating exchanges must give you access to your own personal keys ����

You mean like how some interac E-transfers take up to 45 minutes to send you an email so you can accept the funds for that couch you just sold to Weirdo McCreepy off Craigslist?

To add on, use brave and do faucets. You're young. When you look back on it in 5 years you won't remember all the ads. You'll remember that nice little Bitcoin fund you created before you could even buy it yourself to really start stacking.

Weird that YouTube consistently recommends me sub 10k channels that I'm into if the only promoted stuff is "popular."
@_date: 2019-12-08 09:38:29
Most people implies greater than 50% which should be VERY easy to verify. Do you have any sources that back up your claims that "most people" take part in this event?
Clearly this event does have *an* effect, looking at their failures section on the site. But I've noticed most of those "failures" are only backed up by 1 or 2 tweets. Not 50-60, 100+ or more which is what I would expect to see if a site truly failed this "proof of keys" test event. But with only a handful of tweets per failure, wouldn't it be more likely that those transactions failed due to some other reason than "ran out of Bitcoin, exchange closed" like user error?
But hey, if I'm wrong I would love to hear it. I'd rather be wrong and made safer because of it. Enjoy your day out there. I still like the idea of there being a yearly stress test on the withdrawal function on exchanges.

@_date: 2019-12-10 12:27:45
Just look at the "failures" list on proofofkeys.com it's a list of one to two tweets per exchange of "failures." Which I would put my money on being user error and not "Bitcoin is all gone from exchange pocket lulz"
@_date: 2019-12-08 15:37:18
Thanks, yea, I came to the same conclusion. I read in a different thread from a bold user that the *majority* of people do this lol. I checked out the proofofkeys site and their list of failure look more like a list of users who can't perform a simple withdrawal. It's only 1-2 users per exchange experiencing an issue of some sort.

Not sure if it is a scam or not, but the way they make that 3% for you is by lending out your Bitcoin and making a few % points themselves. So, not sure if scam but definitely risky.
Are you able to withdraw your funds whenever you want or is it locked in?
@_date: 2019-12-08 09:17:29
Do I honestly believe Bitcoin could replace banks?
Not necessarily. But I do think banks will have to adopt bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general. Hell, what's an e-transfer? A private ledger digital transaction. Wouldn't be much of a jump for one bank to go "transferring money to another member of *your bank here* via *your bank tokens* will allow the funds to be accepted with no transaction fees!" 
I also think it's possible we see crypto focused big name banks pop up over the next 10 years that people can trust and use on a daily basis. Because I feel that is the real key to adoption is keeping stuff as close to the same as possible. The easier it is to utilize your Bitcoin the easier it is to think about it like cash rather than gold. Our parents still can't program the VCR they've had since we were kids. Do you really think they can handle the responsibilities of keeping track of their digital wallets? ��
