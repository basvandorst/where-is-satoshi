Just put a wrapper around it and into an app.

I'd definitely pitch in a lot more that I do if I didn't have to go through PayfuckinPal.

It is.

Oh wow not this shit again.
Guess what? **There is nothing inherent to the Dollar either that automagically enables refunds.** It's a freakin service provided by payment processors.
If you pay in fiat cash, you can't get a refund unless the seller agrees to give you your money back of their own accord or a higher authority gets involved. Same with online payments for any currency: It's PayPal or Visa or your bank or any other processor that gets you the refunds, possibly putting the seller's account in negative if they already withdrew the money.

If you had to use Java to be "fun" I'd be worried about you.
@_date: 2013-08-29 09:04:50


There's nothing like that "built into" cash in any other fiat currency either.

Apparently it does more than just act as a microbrowser.

This problem has nothing to do with Bitcoin. It's about an optional service provided by an optional middleman.

They're probably taking the time to make sure you aren't paying any terrorism- or drugs-related dealings. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 14:38:43
All the major online stores: App Store/iTunes, Steam, Gog, PlayStation Network, Xbox Live... Even getting any one of them will do a world of good to Bitcoin adoption and general acceptance.

Wow. Just wow. Oh SRS, you stupid, stupid bitches.

I've had some issues with their Shared Send service too, although they were automatically resolved on their own within a few hours or a day at most.

I doubt it'll be easier than iOS or Android considering how erratic and moody Microsoft is about their own development platforms. The expected tablet-desktop-phone harmony failed to materialize with the Surface flopping, and with the lackluster app market I fear this is going to be another Zune, which is a shame though; the Live Tiles UI is actually kinda cool for a change.
@_date: 2013-08-28 13:18:41
They're afraid. Can't you tell?
