Who actually pays for these tips?

Do u have a choice between google authenticator and authy? Most of the sites ask for googles. 
And not all sites give u the backup codes to write down.

So I could just scan the QR code using Authy?

I don’t. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 21:44:49
As a general rule, I don’t click.

Never type in your bid or sell price - click and edit
