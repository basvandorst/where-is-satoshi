Probably what is going on

I believe you’re looking for Bitpay.com. You can accept bitcoin and / or credit card with this processor. 
Then you choose what ratio you want in fiat versus crypto. You can choose 100% bitcoin in your case even if customers pay 100% with card.

And Canada? ����

Yes it would. But looks like our friends here don’t recommend them so you make up your own mind. I had the chance to visit their office, speak with their employees. They are not scammers in my opinion; BitPay simply has a long term business strategy that does not sit well with the community here maybe ������‍♂️

I lived in Rio de Janeiro for months in 2007 before they cleaned up the favelas. It was deemed super dangerous. 
I also travelled through Bosnia in 2005 while de UN was still securing the region. 
Would you know how the situation in Venezuela really compares ? 
How would we know (the world) if we don’t report on it ?

Depends how old this Asian person was. 
Old: give it back to him. 
Young: ransom ware the owner for 0.1 bitcoin

No I’m not :) not tall nor blond either. That should help me right ;)
I understand it can be very dangerous. That’s why I would want to go only with the help and wisdom of locals. 
Im not joking let’s DM I’d like to come report on this.
