the name BitcoinAsia is a direct translation of their Korean name and their website is actually 
But this website doesn't have much either and it's only in Korean unfortunately.

Because it's guaranteed. 
Most businesses don't have room to play with their revenue. They have expenses to pay. Most businesses would gladly pay a mere 1% for a guaranteed fiat return than manually sell on exchanges for unreliable prices (even if it CAN go up).

uh why not metal..?
@_date: 2014-04-01 04:18:30
You're a fucking retard. That's the Secretary General of UN; Ban Ki Moon and Psy. Both Korean.
Psy, I understand but Ban Ki Moon? Really? There's the UN logo in the background. 
Yes I am mad because I am Korean.

Where did you make this bet? Is it some sort of new betting site?
@_date: 2014-04-14 02:19:32
This is all in the good effort but that design is very ugly. You can downvote me but damn, that van makes bitcoin look like a plumbing company that decided to add a bit of wild to their logo
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:27:33
What does it exactly mean? can anyone eli5 or translate it better than google? 
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:10:35
Honestly this is the reason why I love Bitcoin, it is like a gateway drug for investing. (For now, anyway)
@_date: 2014-04-14 08:45:32
This may be a very stupid question but... in conclusion, in 2040ish, if electricity cost immensely rose and outweigh the miner fee compensation, there would be no more miners and thus no more bitcoin network...?

$10 is too low. 
If we are talking conspiracies, I just simply believe this is work of rich whales and or companies. 
A: Ok B, I'm gonna sell off 100,000 BTC in the course of 3 days.
B: Ok, and I'll buy with my $10 mil when it hits x$. 
3 days later
B: Ok, it's my turn.
A: lul ok
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:35:09
Hi, great site. I love your logo, it's actually quite similar to ours,  
On another note, maybe it should incorporate BTC price later on. Or at least give an option for it. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 04:49:10
If you're going to make a meme trying to diss an entire race (by using pictures of people that are completely unrelated to bitcoin btw) at least don't make yourself look stupid.
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:33:03
Same here. Bought on the dips since 630ish. DCA is about 500 for one BTC I currently hold. 
I know it's not much. That's why I'm not scared. I am down more than half, probably will be down more than $400 or so until the bottom. Am I scared? Maybe a bit. Am I selling? No. 
I'm holding and rather go down with the ship and lose $500 altogether than scrounge up $200 right now. 
It's financially a stupid decision but in life, not all decisions are financially perfect. I don't want to sell now and buy back lower. It's more like a stubborn ego game now. 
This decision comes easy if you have little 'invested' and acknowledge that what you bought is more like an object that is not resellable.
Pretend it's a stock option. You're not allowed to sell until (the usual) 2 years since time of buying. 
But of course, if you were playing the 'trading' game and have a lot more 'invested', you fucked it up from the start. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:04:17
I have 1 BTC that I will never sell. The DCA of the 1 BTC bought over the months is about $500. I lost about half by not selling. But sir, this isn't about money anymore. It's about BALLS.
I will not sell even if bitcoin hits literal zero. I would have just lost $500. That's okay. It's not like my entire savings or anything. I have spent $500+ in a lot worse ways. 
This is about STICKING with your beliefs and your stance. I DON'T want to admit my loss. You my laugh but I'd rather go down with the ship than abandon it. 
Once you 'accept' that the bitcoin you bought is not resell-able, (for example, you bought an antique that you can't resell, but you really like it) all this price falling doesn't mean crap anymore.
I am glad I was a part of a new era of financial technology (if it succeeds) and also be glad I was a part of something new. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:55:02
Interesting concept, although I'm not sure if people will actively volunteer to put their real faces along with Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:22:40
The process is simple but i already have both of my pcs with electrum (same synced wallet). I'm mostly afraid that installing electron cash will compromise the 2nd pc with some sort of malware or something... 
Just doesn't feel clean...
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:00:58
is there anyway to get bcc WITHOUT using electron cash? 
(with my electrum wallet)
Don't want to risk anything...
@_date: 2015-04-22 06:30:42
I would never open a bank account that makes me pay fees for transactions... There are other options, you just went to a very shitty bank. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:06:13
This is one of your worse arguments buddy. While I am not doing this to 'subconsciously' increase my value of BTC, I don't even think that's a bad thing... 
How is: Increased adoption (organically) which leads to increase in value = a bad thing?
That's like saying, Facebook increased adoption which lead to IPO which lead to share and stockholders being rich = a bad thing. 
With your logic, all IPO'd companies and early stock holders are ALL bad people! Everyone, stay away form stocks! Come join the Buttcoin where we bash on everything because we failed to make money ourselves! Come here and be bitter when you lose money investing! Argh I'm bitter, let everyone know! 
What a joke you guys are. you guys really are funny tho. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:32:23
Sure, I can do that. 
But I won't. Do I have control of people who may be sending fake pictures and or fake answers? No. 
But it's the concept that counts. It's about counting people who care enough about Bitcoin to participate. And so far, albeit little, I am finding people willing to participate and be featured. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 05:52:53
Actually a legitimate concern and you're right. One of Bitcoin's advantages are that is it anonymous. However, not ALL Bitcoin users like this feature and don't mind revealing identity while using Bitcoin.
For example,  is a service that puts a name and even a pf pic to your bitcoin address. Did it cause up some controversy when it launched? Yes. Is it still operational? Yes. 
Coinbase also has a similar option where you can tag a specific url to send BTC while using Coinbase. 
Since this project isn't forcing anyone and it voluntary, I see no harm. Granted, it is difficult to find participants at the moment.  
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:51:30
Thanks for backing away. You go bash somewhere else now. Bye.
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:55:32
Yes. As long as they are true, I would. Facebook message the page if you have one. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:57:29
I completely agree with you. It's alright though, I appreciate any publicity than none. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 05:27:35
It's very upsetting when I take my time to explain and you reply with something like that. I'm not a troll so looks like I'll take the latter. 
Move on now. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:41:04
Fair enough. But the questions are broad on purpose. And if they're a foreigner, I usually include a question that goes along the lines of, 'How did you get to Korea?' or 'What are you doing in Korea?'
Next time I will try to approach the questions differently. I actually never thought the responses were similar. 
Anyway, thanks for bringing it out to me. 500 bits
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:20:13
Dude, you keep saying I'm ripping people off. How is this exact project ripping people off?
Damn whales pump and dump, not me. Stop associating the price of Bitcoin with this exact project, Faces of Bitcoin. 
And Bitcoin itself isn't trying to profit off of others, Bitcoin companies are. And that's what companies do... hate on companies and whales.. not genuine people who simply like Bitcoin... nothing more, nothing less.
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:53:11
Lol, Buttcoin user. Should have known. What a waste of time this was.
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:49:53
Oh okay thanks for clarifying :)
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:33:06
I'm the shit poster? 
How ironic. Keep doing what you're doing buddy. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:58:35
I posted on expecting Bitcoin users to like or hate but users are a lot more active it seems like.
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:37:48
Hey look, 
I wasn't aware of this. Thanks for letting me know. But unfortunately for you, I won't be stopping this. I will however stop asking Redditors if they'd like to participate. You can count on me on that. It's very childish and negative here. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:23:52
Fabricated? Care to explain? I personally asked everyone in person or online. But they are people that I actually know in person. edit: And I didn't change or add a single letter to their original interview answers. Only the Korean part may be not 100% in sync because it's translated. (I translated myself)
Yes, it can be fabricated, of course, but it isn't. Right, how can you trust another person on the internet amrite? 
But I feel like people from Bitcoin subreddit tend to be super paranoid about EVERYTHING. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:48:27
Hey if you like genuinely this as your hobby then I've got nothing else to say. 
I can say the same though. You're not a bad guy, just clueless from my perspective. 
Good luck to you as well. Bye.
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:26:56
@_date: 2015-02-12 05:14:03
I actually didn't know about Faces of Atheism until SRD brought it up. I don't care if you believe it or not but that's the truth. I didn't even know such thing existed. 
I only changed the Humans to Faces because Faces of Bitcoin had a better ring than Humans of Bitcoin. Imo at least. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 03:01:21
Finally... one person understood... This was and is my only intention. It sucks it just became internet popcorn to some. But like I said before, any publicity is better than none.
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:45:38
First off, I am going to reply to you back every time.
You call me delusional. You claim I'm in a cult. You're calling me one of those Bitcoin crazy people. To your eyes I may be. But I am not. I am NOT forcing anyone to BUY Bitcoins, HODL, all hail the decentralized system to bring down the banks!, NO. Just no. I was and am simply asking for help. 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP, JUST WALK AWAY. Next time a homeless guy genuinely asks for help, maybe you should lecture him on how he shouldn't have been that way in the first place. That should help him. Right? People like you think you are so smart, and you probably are, but too blind to see what really matters. 
And you called this project based on greed. 
Can I ask you where you got all that from? 
This is what I did: I created a Facebook Page. I posted interviews of people that use or like Bitcoin. I did not pay them to get interviews nor did they pay me to have their interviews. There are no commercial aspect to it, interviewees may mention their Bitcoin related companies that they work for (if they are) but I edit them out if it's commercial. I have no website based on Faces of Bitcoin. I cannot generate ad revenue in any shape or form. I don't have any information of users that I can sell or something. Where is the greed? What, I am going to make a book like HONY and hope to make millions? No. There is no greed in this. There just simply isn't. 
I am simply doing this because I like it and I personally feel this will HELP. To you this act of me trying to HELP may be seen CRAZY. Then sir, I'd say YOU need help. Not everyone is trying to make money and trying to take advantage of things. But you may still disagree. That's your opinion. But obviously I am entitled to mine as well and I will continue to do this.
By posting this and running this project, I am not harming anyone. I am not bringing Bitcoin. There's nothing that is harming you or anyone else. 
But you. You choose to take your time and bash on this project. Yes, you have more upvotes, yes your comment may be wittier. But what makes me sad is that what are you gaining from this? This turned into a big reply battle but just know that I was simply trying to help in my own way without harming anything. 
edit: I forgot to add, there is a reason I compared HONY to Faces of Bitcoin. You're right that it is no where same. But everything has to start from somewhere. HONY didn't immediately get millions of likes in couple days. You only respect HONY because it got to where it is now. I'm sure you would have shitted on it in the beginning as well. There are always people like you. The downers. What do you do for living? 
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:05:46
I asked Roger Ver for an interview via FB and email. And that was the photo he sent me. 
If you're implying I faked the interview/post, you can PM me and I can send you the emails we exchanged. Or you can even ask Roger himself. 
But anyway, thanks for trying to put down a project that's just all about helping Bitcoin grow.
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:47:53
Just because Roger Ver is like that, that doesn't mean all Bitcoin users are like that. Everyone is different. 
Your post is actually one of the reasons why this project is helpful. By showing normal people like yourself (I assume you're 'normal') people can see that Roger Ver is just ONE of MANY Bitcoin users. And not EVERYONE has a political agenda attached to Bitcoin. 
I didn't interview Roger Ver because of what he does, I did it because he was simply a Bitcoin user and was willing to help. 
If I may bash on you however, whatever he's doing is a lot more than what you're contributing to Bitcoin's growth, which is probably nothing. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:29:06
Really? 
Humans of New York, a project that Faces of Bitcoin is based on, has more than 10 million likes on Facebook. 
The photographer has published a book. Sold well. 
Last week, he was able to interview the president of US, Barack Obama. Kind of serious now isn't it? 
Of course, Faces of Bitcoin is nowhere near that but everything has to start from somewhere. 
You may laugh all you want but I am just one of few positive people who are trying to help bring light to the Bitcoin itself to broad audience. 
I don't care if you're trolling or just a hater but I will continue to do this as long as people are willing to participate. 
Keep hating online over Reddit comments. Let's see who has wasted more time in a year or two. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:22:10
This is because I am currently located in Korea and most people I interview are people that I know personally. They are foreigners that currently live in Korea. 
Why does everyone think it's fabricated? Don't be haste to judge everything.
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:31:56
I'm not mad, I'm intrigued. If I was mad, I wouldn't reply to you. And, if I wasn't confident on arguing with you I wouldn't either. 
With that said, I don't think we're fighting a losing battle here. You know why? People like you are always fucking with us to bring us down. Is it logical for people to bring down/hate something that is completely a losing battle? Think about that. In fact, your hatred fuels me to continue. 
Only thing I can agree and accept with your argument is the environmental issue. The electricity and whatever else negative things mining produces, is indeed bad. But so is everything else. Printing money is retarded as hell if you take your time to look into that. 
Anyway, Bitcoin companies also DO things. They don't...just exist and try to scam people... If they were VCs, (who are definitely smarter and richer than you) wouldn't be investing into them. Companies are the ones making the change, and those changes include things you mentioned above. 
That's the point. People like you don't DO SHIT except bash and troll about anything. And there are other kinds of people who DO SHIT trying to make things easier for stupid people to use, like yourself. 
edit: might have been unclear, so Im adding this: 
When I mean Bitcoin companies do things, they are doing things so that Bitcoin protocol itself is easily usable. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:10:07
LOL WHY DO YOU CARE HOW I SPEND MY TIME? 
So... I can help the animals and environment but not Bitcoin. Okay, why? Oh, because you said so! 
This is your opinion. And this is my time. Don't tell me what to do with my time. 
And I've already explained your fail logic of spreading awareness causing 'harm' in the post below. 
Keep'em coming. I got time to spare, just not for animals and environments that you like. lol
