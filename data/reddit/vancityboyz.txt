Can someone please clarify the steps to take to invest in this company through a TFSA. I've tried finding information on it today but nothing clearly states how. Much appreciated.

ThomasGullen you definetly bring up some good points. 
Girl friend is chinese and speaks fluent mandarin as well as her family has property in Tsingtao we could stay in. I really would only be interested in covering flight costs the rest of the trip would be fairly inexpensive.Trading in a country im not familar with is a valid point and establishing who I would meet and where to sell the coins deffinetly would be a challenge. Local laws I have absolutly 0 clue.Yes I guess I would be banking on the idea bitcoin doesnt drop as well that the gap between currencies dont close to much.You have snapped me out of my at work daydreaming. Thank you

Since all commenters have confirmed this is possible does someone mind explaining what is holding the chinese from converting there yen to american to buy Bitcoins on an american bitcoin exchange then selling there bitcoin person to person profiting a huge difference compared to the loss in conversion fees?

Andrethegiantshead I would assume I would use the yuan as payment throughout the trip and then whatevers left pay a conversion cost of a few percentage back to Canadian at any currency exchange...?

but what about just taking the left over CNY with me after 
the trip and converting to CDN back home?
