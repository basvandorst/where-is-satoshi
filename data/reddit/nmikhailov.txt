You can't check if your are signing right transaction or not. i.e you shouldn't use it with untrusted computers.

As a Russian citizen I assure you, that its not true at all. In fact I think Russians are far less civilized than most Europeans.

Have you thought about adding a screen for ledger ~~blue~~ unplugged like its done on some EMV cards(althought their screens are very small and will give poor usability in this usecase)?

Hmm, you should advertise this feature more. I skipped it because I mostly use non official clients(which I belive do not support that). So if I have paired smarphone I can use ledger safely on any PC. The only downside seems to be relying on ledger co services.
One can still argue that it is less convinient to have 3 devices (ledger, security card, smartphone) versus 1 trezor.

Nice design! You should add support for HW wallets

Can you put your private key on it? From the video it looks like no. And thats kinda forces me to trush keepkey developers, right?

Idk why ts thinks that its about Russia's own crypto. In fact it is speculated that this is a reaction to recent QIWI Bit-rouble and cryptocurrecy announcements.

I would guess that they just forgot/never bothered with it. Filtering messages and calculating posts are different tasks and are most likely are in different places in the code. I would imagine it would be trivial to fix though.

This is interesting, I haven't thought about this before. I suspect it would be relatively easy for malware to install a browser plugin to replace bitcoin addresses with attacker's one. And/or make a URI handling proxy which would modify bitcoin links and pass them along.

Wow, I am surprised that LBC is banned in Germany
