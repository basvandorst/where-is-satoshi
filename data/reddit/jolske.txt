Encrypt them and store on cloud, plain text digital or not is unnecessary risk

Many people might recommend paper wallets or hardware wallets but i think they are not the ones you want to use with relatively small amounts, just google electrum and download and set it up
@_date: 2018-08-19 13:03:15
Solid analysis.

Hodling is a weak strategy to play in bear market and everyone should handle their money as they like. And that said why would institutional money want to invest in a bear market?
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:17:37
People like to have explanations for everything and it is not possible for them to think that people are selling btc because they are afraid.. btc is the future! Moon! Lambos! See?
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:38:24
Well that development didnt really help bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:12:51
Funny how bullish TA always leaves biggest timescales and moving averages out of the prediction
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:40:04
Its signed on client side with javasricpt to my knowledge so this seems like nonsense fud. But hey maybe im wrong 
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:35:57
Well thats the dumbest thing i have seen this year
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:30:30
A lot of bots have propably flagged those addresses and they sell if they move maybe
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:22:23
There is no use cases for btc in first world countries other than maybe philosophical one that is anarchy against banks, and even with gold you can do that. So literally almost everyone who has bitcoins have them because they think the price is going to rise. You dont need to hold bitcoins if you are just excited about the ”tech”...
@_date: 2018-05-16 00:21:16
Bitcoin as of now is a speculative asset and the price doesnt care about usage plus you cant use it for every day purchases. And yeah, dont listen to event based predictions in general
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:18:51
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:46:38
Bitcoin itself is not a bubble but the price is
@_date: 2018-05-16 00:28:09
Only actual thing that bitcoin lacks is privacy, even though arguably it is super private already, nothing will dominate it or if so, the whole cryptomarket will crash
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:27:09
Yea and its dumb there too
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:40:08
Horrible time to buy imo
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:28:14
I get bullish feeling from this
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:34:21
He just got over hyped, there is no limitless exponential growth when money and peoples life savings are involved
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:42:12
I believe in bitcoin but i dont believe price to go up anytime soon, two different things
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:57:54
Cant really help u with timing your buys but it is gonna be cheaper in couple months
E. Oops ment to reply
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:25:23
Funny how useless fork like this is timed exactly to occur at the same time as the consensus conference. Really makes you think hmmmmm...
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:56:39
I agree 100% on the drop part, just wait it to show positive signs at 5k cause it might very well drop even lower. Idk about end year pump we will see i guess
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:54:39
Yeaaah... thats not the why
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:56:26
Yea sure, if it seems dumb to implement then there is no reason to do it
@_date: 2018-06-05 00:43:05
As of now there is no practical ways of autopay. Still u should consider adding btc because it might increase your subs, but up to you
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:22:51
Bitcoin has 12,5 btc inflation every 10min lol...
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:07:03
Btc dont need no printing it can lose value on its own!
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:21:08
Damn i was about to post the same thing
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:49:05
You can marry the trade if u want or u can adapt and protect your gains, up to u.. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:28:42
Bitcoin is not some cheap pump and dump scheme, stop treating it like one. Value in the network is the basis for everything, not the tx count
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:03:42
I don’t think bitcoin needs new users right now, they will come when the time is right. Btc and bch communities are like modern religions with their bashing of other sides and the crazy need that everyone has to join them now. Lol 
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:48:35
Brave is the only one i think will take over
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:16:55
Smart dude
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:56:20
Now this is a bullish sign lol
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:40:53
Imo anything that is not encrypted is not secure
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:35:27
That’s the right way
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:00:47
Probably not paid, just manipulated
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:47:08
One hard fork and problem solved
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:33:55
Oh i will check it out
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:38:45
I have not yet seen a single shop accepting bitcoin so how can I relish the tech? Drooling at the source code?
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:26:59
Well now u have no bitcone at all
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:39:01
Contact gdax support maybe
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:19:53
This sounds like a really dumb idea, idk how she got nasa funds for this
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:24:51
I don’t believe that these issues should be solved over night with the most simplistic solutions available. Sure the scaling is a big issue and needs to be solved but thats the whole focus of bitcoin right now anyways. There is ton of optimizations being developed and implemented currently.
Bigger problem is the way some impatient people treat bitcoin as a religion that needs to be pushed for mass adoption today, no matter at what cost. Not naming names but some altcoins especially do this
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:45:07
I would buy items i need and convert rest to btc, then tomorrow i would buy things i need again (suppose the shops accept btc)... Your thinking is a bit flawed i think
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:32:36
It would be 5% of the market cap and people with leveraged longs would take heavy profits on that kind of pump and others would short it on top of that.
Mainly markets just correct themselves on sudden moves, especially if it happens on weekend and leaves a gap in cmoe (or whatever it was) futures, yea maybe it could go higher
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:52:42
Wick to 5k max then correction to current levels i think
