We need distributed exchanges asap.
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:56:22
Quite impressive if you ask me.
@_date: 2014-02-11 01:01:57
Talk about shooting yourself in the foot AND biting the hand that feeds. GOXXED!
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:45:38
Crap, everybody panic sell those woolly mammoth tusks!

He's the hero Bitcoin deserves, but not the one it needs right now.
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:31:42
Since Coinbase buys/sells off Bitstamp, the prices make no sense. I suspect this is a bug that's been getting worse by the day since the big crash on Feb 7. Coinbase will lose a lot of money over this and once it's fixed, I believe the market may react very negatively.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:29:01
No need to panic, they'll probably arrive after gox BTC prices are dumped to $1.
@_date: 2014-01-10 14:13:52
wow that sucks..
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:38:52
wow, this is gonna bring in a lot of new users.
@_date: 2014-05-14 05:34:50
agreed, what a waste.
@_date: 2014-11-16 17:44:53
I like his style!
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:02:46
we are goin deep this time
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:21:43
I don't think that's true unless you can send me a link where it says that. If addresses were randomized every transaction, it would cause a huge bloat in the blockchain. If you have the original unencrypted wallet.dat, that should be fine. You may just need to load it in a prior version of bitcoin-qt.
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:21:18
Whatever you're gonna do, stop and do the complete opposite. Reverse psychology that bitch. Profit. 
You're welcome.

500 by the end of the year.

NMC PUMPING TO $20. DON'T GET LEFT BEHIND!
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:40:44
Or just let him buy his own bitcoins... do you really want to be responsible for someone else's bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:16:51
The code is open source so it's not like they are trying to hide something. If you don't trust them, audit the code yourself.
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:58:08
This highlights one of the biggest dangers to new Bitcoin users. We really need an easy and foolproof method for storing BTC safely..
@_date: 2013-11-02 05:04:39
wait till you meet ToTheMoonGuy!
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:45:51
It took me 3 weeks to get my issue resolved. Try hitting up their twitter. Reese will help you out.
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:33:40
Might as well throw that cash into a burning fire... or buy bitcoins ;)
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:58:57
500 by the end of the day, go go go!
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:24:42
Took 3 weeks for me to get my issue resolved but it eventually did. I would give it more time, they were tweeting that some bank deposits were delayed this week.
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:28:07
it's used for a unit test..
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:29:32
Thanks! Ordered 2. I believe POS systems are the next big thing for Bitcoin. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:34:54
In the near future... Bitcoin takes over as the world's de facto currency. At this time, 1 BTC ≈ $1,000,000. To the moon!
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:36:26
Looks like he works at google where they use the code in their json parser. If that's true, it'd be worth quite a bit more than 1 BTC.
@_date: 2013-09-20 04:07:29
so it's basically like a free heater? niiice
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:18:09
We have to get to the moon before we crash!
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:31:45
Hold on cause that'll be our next stop.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:23:01
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:15:33
After the mini crash last week I began to have my doubts. It's unbelievable how well it's recovered since then. To me, it looks like we're going to the moon after all!
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:50:19
Don't count this bull run over just yet. There's vastly more buying power behind this wave over April's.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:05:44
When I click the link it says, you already have an account, Logout and start over. I just signed up for an account though. I see preorder available for .5 BTC, is that the 50% off price?
@_date: 2013-09-20 04:19:38
Holy shit those numbers are depressing. I guess it's good to be on the cautious side. I think ASICS will have to hit a wall performance-wise at some point. From there who knows what will happen.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:16:25
License my fat ass (\__|__)
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:06:48
I'd like to see an email saying.. 
Sorry for the inconvenience, the 2.1 BTC Instant Buy you made on November 3rd has been credited to my account. 
I know the support team is swamped but common..
EDIT: Support has resolved this issue. Thanks Rees!
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:21:00
Does this POS work without Wifi? I see it says World GSM, will this work in the field? and how much does it cost if so?
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:41:07
Don't store all your coins in an online wallet. You hear so many horror stories of people getting their online wallet hacked. Backup your encrypted wallet / private keys in a secure location. Learn how to save bitcoins in cold storage!
I recommend you start by actually using Bitcoin first. Get a feel for how wallets and payments work. Then start investing a little at time until you start to feel comfortable. Coinbase.com is the easiest way to start, although their software is sometimes buggy and support is kinda slow.
@_date: 2013-11-01 00:28:12
just wait 20 years, you'll be a millionaire
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:34:16
You are more disciplined than most.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:30:06
Their App Store does kind of suck.
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:24:07
Support has pretty much ignored me.. straight up robbery. I would caution users before using this site, it's still quite buggy and support is virtually non-existent. I tried going through the proper channels, sad I had to come complain here.
EDIT: Support has resolved this issue. Thanks Rees!
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:20:02
Stop trading, you obviously suck balls at it. $280,000 is a lot of money. You need to give your sister $280,000 + the difference you lost. YOU fucked up, time to face the music.
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:15:47
I did an instant buy of 2.1 BTC on November 3rd that still hasn't gone through... The bank payment cleared on the 7th but I've yet to receive the BTC. Support says I reached my limit for instant buy at the time which isn't what it was telling me when I was buying it.. Plus it doesn't even show up like a normal transaction telling me when I should be receiving the BTC, it only appears in my history. Why has support failed to acknowledge this as a problem?
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:23:39
goes up too fast?

Good luck, I've been waiting for my 2.1 BTC instant purchase to arrive for over 2 weeks now..
EDIT: Support has resolved this issue. Thanks Rees!

No, Butterfly. I HATE BUTTERFLIES!
@_date: 2013-10-23 02:38:10
Kind of surprising since all other Bitcoin transmitting/wallet apps always seem to get pulled from the App Store
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:20:00
They see how many pennies they can stick up my butt and then divide that by the current market value of 1 BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:13:05
RIGHT ON COURSE FOR MOON LANDING @ ETA 31 HOURS
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:41:14
BY MY ESTIMATES, MOON LANDING ETA 48 HOURS
