I think a better idea, is to use correct English words, with correct spelling, but choose 24 of them (randomly, not grammatically).
Ultimately that will be easier to remember, and the number of possible combinations are out-of-this-world enormous.

OP wasn't talking about wallets. Bitpay is Namecheap's chosen payment provider.
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:31:11
Because you're quoting the exchange rate in USD. But all of those trades work the same from the other side too (i.e.  1 USD has a BTC price) therefore the volume can be quoted in BTC just as legitimately.
Every single buy is also a sell.
@_date: 2018-12-26 21:00:07
Experts do make money though. They get ridiculous salaries from large organisations for predicting the wrong thing.

Regardless, if you find that exchange between two currencies is difficult, it doesn't make sense to blame just *one* of those currencies.
Every buy is a sell, and if you're saying that BTC is difficult to buy, then USD is difficult to sell.
