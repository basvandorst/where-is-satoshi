Sorry to hear this OP. There are tons of people in this space who beat themselves over missed opportunity and the millions they could have had. I always have to remind myself that hindsight is 20/20... Wishing you and your family the best.

Thanks for posting this, important for people to see this. Don't beat yourself up over this stuff, its the wild west and no one knew it would get this crazy this fast. I am so sorry for your loss OP.

I just sent my first tip using twitter yesterday! Next up is Youtube! Lets get the tipping going everywhere! (I apologize for the excessive enthusiasm!)

Yes, I thought the 10 minute confirmations was the main issue..... I know Bitpay remedies the situation; however, merchants still need to pony up for a tablet or something. What is the issue with the number of nodes decreasing, is it only an issue because there are less stored copies of the block chain? This stuff is confusing....

Commercials Bruuhh, at the end of Overstock commercials they have the Bitcoin logo and "now accepting bitcoin" I'm watching treehouse masters on history channel then bam! I see that beautiful logo! 
Since no one has mentioned it yet (and I checked!)
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:48:11
Thanks! I will be sure to spread it around!
@_date: 2014-07-03 22:51:22
Submitted this before and got no response. If it happens again then I will leave it at that. However, is this possible?
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:38:03
If anyone is interested you can check his stuff out at 
He doesn't accept btc on the site, but you can hit him up on twitter and strike a deal like I did!
@_date: 2014-01-25 09:06:39
Yeah I mean 500 million isn't 2 billions but still...
@_date: 2014-09-11 01:54:37
at least you have more points! :)

Anyone know if the bitcoin qt "skin", as described in the linked post, is something plausible?
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:35:27
Nothing. But it would be even cooler if TigerDirect kept my bitcoins and paid their suppliers with it! Full circle bro!
@_date: 2015-01-31 04:01:24
He will be done by March.
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:46:37
Unless they got in like 2 plus years ago!
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:22:28
Again, all great points. 
I too use venmo and the like to settle up with friends. And these payment apps really have helped to bring money transfer fees down (increased competition to WU)
Bitcoin won me over in early 2012, it was all about ideals. I was (am) a fanboy of the satoshi white paper. currency not tied to a government has many benefits, but just as many drawbacks (or hurdles at least)
I agree with you, bitcoin cannot function as a traditional currency at this point. But it is far closer to doing so than it was say 5-6 years ago. 
One thing it is exceptional at is providing returns (at least for now), like you mentioned in your first post!
P.S. thanks for opposing yet amicable conversation
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:27:24
Yeah, but how fast can you transfer $10 million without any paperwork to and from anywhere in the world?
Also, I've used btc to buy several things over the last few years, which I could have used a credit card for. 
But you are right, these returns are nuts!
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:54:28
Kudos for your valid arguments!
Yes, I did not take into account that some of the transactions may have been converted to fiat. 
I bought several pieces of art and sent several BTC direct to the artist, I know that he still holds those coins! 
Also, I have spent a decent amount on overstock's website, and they claim to keep a large percent of their crypto payments in crypto!
But, yes with laws and all that good stuff, you can easily find yourself in trouble (whether you intended to break laws or not). Likely smarter to just pay any wire transfer fees, at least for now!

The first pool I ever mined with was Slush's, actually did the majority of my mining with his pool! GG Slush

I will sell when the BTC to Lambo ratio is 1:1
@_date: 2015-04-15 07:57:38
Sounds like a cool idea!

Enable 2 step authentication for your Gmail.   Also, go ahead and google Kim dot com's MegaNet.

It wont take 3 years, it will take maybe like 6  days. I have downloaded it multiple times on different computers. I did it just last week, and it took about 5 days I think.
@_date: 2015-02-20 11:25:19
Shhhh. Don't tell anyone I want to buy some of those cheap coins!
@_date: 2016-07-16 08:10:28
Okay then I'll hold 'til we hit ~$77.9k per coin!
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:43:24
Yup, you are currently in the lead. I mean unless nobbynobbynoob reveals his age (I heard he was like 105.)
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:15:07
I started with bitfloor yesterday and so far so good. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 08:04:51
I suppose I am lucky. They owe me $2.50! Just in case you want to add me in to that total.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:20:48
Ha, sorry for the misleading title.
@_date: 2013-05-08 09:12:30
I think I would get no sleep
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:50:44
Ha YES! Looks like I may have to fashion my own stamp!
@_date: 2013-03-26 19:40:03
we can only hope
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:50:12
works again.... and the down time saved me $5 per bitcoin!

ASL ASL ASL... haha sorry your format made me laugh.... but hey at least your a realist (wantrepreneur!)

If he wanted to keep the BTC, so no need for bitpay, couldn't he post a QR code and a wallet address for people to send the payment to. No real need for tablets, or am I missing something. I want to present him with all options.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:38:41
Did they show up in blockchain yet? Last week it took nearly 2 hours before btc from bitfloor showed up in my blockchain wallet. Just sent the rest of my btc on bitfloor to blockchain like 30 minutes ago. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 03:21:39
looks a bit like bitfloor did...
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:41:53
I have a friend who has a house/property on a river in Nicaragua . He was looking to get about $13,000 worth of Bitcoin, if anyone is interested PM me! Let me add my friend is almost 70 years old!
@_date: 2013-08-31 08:27:11
I know we don't like using Mt.gox as an absolute price indicator, but whats up with the 35k btc trading and spiking the price by $10. then 4 or 5 days later it spikes to 35k btc trading and price goes up another $10. Too early for a pattern but it is odd.

This. Are you a mind reader, because this is exactly what I did! As far as spreading the good word of bitcoin, I have been talking about it with everyone. After about 6 weeks of reading through r/bitcoin and clicking everything people linked to, I feel comfortable talking with people about it. When I talk about bitcoin, with people unfamiliar with it, I am excited about sharing. In sales, I have learned, excitement begets excitement. Now, I wasn't telling these people to get on an exchange and buy bitcoin; however, after seeing how excited about it I was, two of them went and bought some bitcoin. It is worth mentioning these people are not tech savvy people. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:10:49
This is exactly what I am curious about! Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2013-04-27 09:39:34
I would buy like 10 BTC worth, and give a few chips to someone who can help me set up a mining rig with them.... Takers?
@_date: 2013-10-12 01:29:33
I forgot/didn't have my identifier, as I usually used an alias. Blockchain.info was able to help me out with getting access to my wallet/identifier in less than 24 hours. Just so you guys see their customer service is not complete crap.
@_date: 2013-09-01 05:51:45
 also accepts bitcoins. Probably not completely surprising.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:34:39
That's what I was thinking. I googled the username of one of the people I am looking to buy from. His name and email popped up a linked in account. The guy seems like he is legitimate plus, he is a redditor.... I just wanted to see what people around here thought.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:56:02
Bitfloor.com is a quick way to buy.
