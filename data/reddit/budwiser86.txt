I am not from any charity, I will use them on drugs and hookers. Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:00:42
This is probably the biggest disadvantage. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:47:07
He is just trolling 
@_date: 2016-08-23 16:11:43
Use shape-shift to buy monero, then buy bitcoin from it into a new bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:36:47
I thought this was another anti coinbase  thread. 
There is so much of hatred against coinbase on this sub.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:10:59
Did Roger buy the handle? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:00:33
And made Andreas a millionaire too. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:28:25
Yes, you can generate cold wallet address and go complete off grid. I am not sure how that compares to a hardware. It should be pretty safe for smaller amounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:04:55
If your account is found suspicious, you may be locked out of your account. Basically you won't have full control of your account. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:01:02
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:18:01
I really hope so too.
@_date: 2018-08-10 02:34:37
It will go down to make the saucer for the cup now! 
@_date: 2017-02-04 02:59:58
Woah, the blockchain size would be 2gb? I just can't even
@_date: 2017-02-10 03:28:28
I don't think ethereum will get lightening network anytime soon. Raiden will be out in 2018 is what I heard. I could be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:26:52
That would be good, but its really hypothetical. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:44:13
Was there a spike in nodes supporting Segwit after the incident? Where do we track the Segwit support percentage? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 04:39:58
Sorry, can someone who knows better tell me your thoughts on rootstock? Is it really going to bring ethereum on bitcoin network? 
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:31:08
Why 1300+? It can go back to 900 too. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:05:49
You are the troll Andreas was talking about. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:24:18
Absolutely, but not just bitcoin and they haven't a different title in their announcement. Don't get me wrong, I am a bitcoin core guy!.  
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:32:35
Bait title - "For blockchain and cryptocurrency applications". 
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:00:05
It was different in 2010, we now have hundreds of altcoins. Some offering alot more than what bitcoin does.  It just takes time, nothing is too big to fail.   
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:01:37
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:41:46
Didn't litecoin implement Segwit? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:49:56
How? He sold at ATH in 2013? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:19:41
You are downloading it on your phone?! 
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:17:41
Any idea when Poloniex will be Segwit ready? 
@_date: 2016-06-09 06:10:30
So what's the point of rootstock? Aren't rootstock trying to do the same thing? 
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:06:30
Yep, I never had problems with them either. Their customer service has been good too. I have seen a lot of hate on reddit for them. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:52:39
That slanted B, makes it look like BCH :) 
@_date: 2017-01-21 14:19:39
Wallets should get better, these can turn away potential users. Sorry, but bitcoin is just too complicated for the general public. Wallets should warn or never allow a fee more than a certain value. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 09:08:55
Satoshi never said in his posts or white paper that he could tie his shoes without help! 
@_date: 2016-06-18 05:05:11
Rootstock is centralized? Does it mean it's controlled by Rootstock company or by a central authority? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:04:00
Nobody got nothing is what I heard. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:36:39
Sorry off the topic, what is that?! 
@_date: 2017-01-08 14:45:23
Why are some of the miners not happy with Segwit? Isn't scaling good for everyone?  
Edit :Grammer
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:44:48
Thanks all for your responses. I was so excited when i heard segwit was out. Its kind of disappointing to learn that coding it was just a small step towards lightening network becoming reality.
@_date: 2016-11-08 03:14:14
Damn, Trump would be proud of you. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:01:50
.. Neo
@_date: 2019-04-11 04:04:04
Bitcoin Checker.. Works for many coins and exchanges.. You can set alarms for every 3 or 5% price change. I have been using it for a long time.. Has worked each time.
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:15:44
Have you time travelled? 
@_date: 2017-04-27 10:42:25
Yes please, this would be a major push. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:54:06
I thought it's 95%, I was just asking if we will hit 50% if f2pool supports Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:40:14
Excellent, I am going to bookmark this.  Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:16:18
You mean volatility against USD? 
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:15:57
Sorry what's RV? 
@_date: 2017-04-18 08:47:37
Awesome, will we touch 50%?
@_date: 2016-09-15 07:00:00
Perfect use for karma. 
@_date: 2016-09-19 08:12:49
I am hearing that the auto loan industry looks in similar shape, mortgage industry was back in 2007. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 09:20:08
Looks like he will help us further better our security. 
@_date: 2016-09-04 10:40:38
@_date: 2016-09-01 02:54:37
Yes, maidsafe network would be a complete solution. Once the messaging service and safecoins are implemented into it, it will be truly anonymous. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:03:52
He is a man from the future, like Satoshi.    
@_date: 2016-09-17 08:58:23
Waiting. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 00:11:16
Soon. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:48:45
Good point, is there a roadmap for atomic swaps? Do we have it in roadmap for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:53:40
Sorry but where does it take the exchange value from between two coins? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:03:45
@_date: 2015-04-14 00:07:01
Thanks guys, I should've learnt more before jumping in! 
@_date: 2015-04-20 04:11:59
Thanks guys. Will try them out. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:18:35
Yes, please update. Thanks for the info. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:07:57
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:16:47
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:28:33
We look at bitcoin as digital gold because of confirmation times, it would become a currency if we have Segwit + LN.
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:36:18
Why the downvotes? Is it not true? Explain if you disagree 
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:58:15
Please, let's hold until Segwit+LN. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 12:30:20
Some said the same in 2013! 
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:50:49
Excellent analogy. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 00:50:05
Segwit+LN would definitely set the stage for mass adoption. Along with that, we need good user interface applications and wallets too. I have introduced a few friends and its just too complicated for them. They just feel safer to keep bitcoins in an exchange and don't understand the importance of security. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 16:14:02
Coinomi. Because this wallet can hold many coins and they keep updating, adding newer coin support. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:12:38
Poloniex does not  use local time, did you check the current server time at the bottom? 
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:42:04
I assume you mean it's intimidating. I think it's not so tough to use, but it can be intimidating. That's because we are used to banks controlling our money. 
There is definitely some learning curve to use bitcoin. Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:22:20
So? 
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:27:13
CNN, Please screen the documentary again!
@_date: 2015-10-13 18:17:41
Coinomi on android is good. It can hold many coins. And they keep adding more too! 
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:58:46
"Customers who wish to access both bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCC) need to withdraw bitcoin stored on GDAX before 11.59 pm PT July 31, 2017. If you do not wish to access bitcoin cash (BCC) then no action is required."
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:04:18
Hope that's not your private key! 
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:01:29
Let's be honest, bitcoin is just not ready yet for the general public. Hope we get to a better position soon before mass adoption happens. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 08:44:33
Yep, I have bought and sold like atleast 50 times now and didn't have an issue. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:22:15
To be honest, I thought $650 was impossible just last year. And even early this year. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 17:26:02
What!? Bitcoin white paper didn't come out in 19th century. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 17:05:40
A well-made documentary 
@_date: 2016-07-17 07:54:00
We need more people like Andreas and Joe. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 07:03:02
That's true. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:11:37
They are abit expensive though. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 07:22:01
Lightening network, rootstock!
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:36:11
Yep, me too. Not for three years, but its been an year and a half now. This has become a habit now for me. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 06:54:55
Yes, but because of the rapid rise in ethereum coupled with the forking debates that were going on.
