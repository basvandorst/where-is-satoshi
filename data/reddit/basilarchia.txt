Also, the entire US code of law needs to be maintained that way. As it stands now, it's totally crazy because instead of having the law, it's basically ta huge collection of patches that haven't been applied.
In many cases, there are patches that are actually diffs to other patches that have not been applied.

I spent some time digging and couldn't find them. That is rather disappointing I think. Having the original recordings is likely to make this a much larger story and reach a much larger audience.

I have to agree with above, there needs to be a Citation here before we just jump on a GS hating bandwagon. I'm not saying the story above is true, but in some ways it does seem a bit far fetched. Greece failing due to some guys at GS? Spain?

Hey, sorry about he idiot comment. That was benith both of us.
I guess I just took offence without understanding the concept of "fiscal liberals". Perhaps because I associate with the concept of liberal. It's a word I like. For me, it means freedom. It was how I was raised. I think you were raised in a different place where it was negative. Here in bitcoin, we both meet as equals and understand the same thing.
I'm a free software guy. I first met some awesome people working on free software. I made the mistake of thinking they were all going to be "liberal" people like me. Why not! We were working on freedom! Then I met one of the most awesome free software guys (Eric Raymond) and he was a staunch libertarian/republican gun toting opposite of me! It turns out we were great friends. Bitcoin is bigger than politics, and it's fun to meet people of different views.
Peace from a radical hippy liberal!

You sound like an idiot for saying this and it leads me to believe that you are more part of the problem than part of any sort of solution. Generalizations of this nature are counterproductive to any possible rational discussion of options.

Sorry, I was just being sarcastic. It's just silly to do bitcoin only. Clearly most people walking in will only have cash. Turning them away doesn't make any sense.

Bitcoin is mathematical.
It is similar to E=MC^2. It exists and you can use it to make a nuclear bomb or instead a nuclear power plant.
You can money launder or defraud with $100 bills. Or, you can use them to try to cure cancer.

It's true that "liberal" position is that wealthy people should pay more in taxes. That DOES NOT have anything to do with arbitrarily taking money from people for no reason what so ever. That's just a ludicrous connection.

We replaced their system of yapping their mouths with a superior system based on pure mathematics. They have been deprecated.
@_date: 2015-05-01 17:56:53
Ya, seriously. to get a patent all the way to approval (unless you are a patent lawyer yourself or have a good deal) then I think $100k is standard. Sometimes you can do more than one at a time or 3 or 4 at a time, then maybe it would average out to $50k each.
I'm afraid your contract clause, although 'fun', is not practical as most companies would ask you to remove it, and the ones that left it wouldn't care about $25k.
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:34:25
Ok, fair enough. From that perspective I stand corrected. Especially since I was being so jerky about my original response! I forgot about the market cap.
Well, ok, ya. This is a problem. $200k bitcoins would be like BRK.A, but I find that somehow annoying. But that's just because on the NYSE no one normal can afford to buy 100 of those at a time. Here with bitcoins, it's just mathematical.
I hope that price going forward is slow at this point however. With it's continued popularity I hope brings stability. Maybe it takes 5 years to get to $2k. That would be fine.
Also, there will still be more coins created. bitcoin isn't a monopoly. Maybe it will end up like myspace. OK. Yahoo would be a nicer analogy as they are still around.
@_date: 2015-05-02 20:29:13
Ah, ok, let me know how it works when you decide to try tax evasion and/or fight the IRS. If you have a business, they will just seize everything else, so ya, they can easily get your bitcoins unless you just want to go to jail.
@_date: 2015-05-20 10:51:43
Well bitcoin stability is in the best interest of everyone. Those early speculators hopefully will be done now. That was fun and all, but now the real usefulness will come to be.
If the price settles at $200~ for each bitcoin, then fine. The best thing that can happen is it can settle down against the USD.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised that he is the first person to do this. Since the tea party/libertarians  are such money grubbing assholes, they'll take anything they can get in any form.
@_date: 2015-05-02 20:04:02
Well, the IRS can seize bitcoins also so this is kinda stupid to be posting IRS stuff like this here. Bitcoin is just another currency.
@_date: 2015-05-02 22:13:33
What the hell are you talking about. You couldn't be more wrong about everything related to bitcoin. Frankly you sound like a person interested in defrauding the US government or cheating the IRS. I have zero interest in discussing ether topic. Bitcoin is interesting to me because it's legitimate. In many ways, it's more legitimate because it's pseudo-anonymous.
Sorry if I'm a bit harsh on this subject, but this is a subject that really pisses me off.

WTF does this have to do with leftism? In fact, it's the leftists (democrats) that are actively fighting the increasing militarization of the police, the increase of sentencing and fighting the private prison system in general. If you are trying to rewrite history as if it's not a republican problem, then you aren't going to get away with those lies here.

Software patents at silicon valley legal rates. I don't know what these other people are talking about with $11k and what not. That would make me assume it won't be defensible. You get what you pay for I think.

Says who? That sounds like total bullshit to me.
Edit: Hey -- to the bitstamp devs &amp; founders. Good luck with all this. It seems you guys are legit trying here. It would be helpful to the world to just publish your cold storage address so the world can confirm you really have coins left. Then I think all the worry would melt away. Until then, there is going to be lots of speculation of fraud.

There is an answer to your question:

Where R, V, S and X are all zero

Court? Are you fucking serious? If I was Coinbase, I'd be hiring this guy on the spot. I'm going on the assumption that this $10 'double spend' transaction really happened.  If so, this is a big fucking problem. There must be piles of people brute force attempting this right now. If this kills all transactions that haven't waited 60 seconds for verification, then this would obviously be the end of bitcoin retail (or high speed trading). Or, why couldn't this have been the way all the money was taken from mtgox?

Your most effective signage might have been the one over the ATM.
I might suggest you post it next to the ATM rather than on it where the next person will be forced to remove it. Then, go around and post it (on both sides as it will draw the eye) at every ATM you can find. Also, every door entrance to every bank branch.
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:17:46
Unfortunately, you sent it to the wrong recipient and you can never get it back.
This is a real problem that we have to address. Ultimately it was the reason visa and mastercard had the fees (fraud, abuse, etc). This is a pure mathematical model, so there isn't a way to unwind fraud and abuse -- and those things are serious and significant problems.
I don't have an answer, I just wanted to speak my mind.
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:34:13

@_date: 2015-04-09 12:39:05
Totally. They don't have to loose the percentage to Visa and Mastercard. They probably don't have really great margins to begin with so Bitcoin is a serious profit advantage on _any_ purchase.
You can argue fraud, but as a guy that is _very_ well versed in credit card fraud on a very large scale, VISA and mastercard don't do fucking shit to protect you as a vendor. You are totally on your own. I'll give a special shout out to both of them: You totally suck. I'll happily take my chances with bitcoin ever day of the week over those bastards. At least there aren't charge-backs. I'll spare you how much I've lost in stolen credit cards over the years, but I'm sure I could buy a plane. A big plane.
@_date: 2015-09-23 20:51:08
Unfortunately, that's not true at all. There are lots of patent trolls that will file them and then sue you. Filing defensive patents is worth it once you are a certain size (which coinbase certainly is). I think Garzik is correct it pushing for this patent arrangement that google and tesla are following, and, based on the investors that coinbase has, I would expect tthey will follow the same route.
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:48:40
The cryptocurrency world can't be allowed to be hijacked by scam artists and criminals. This concept is too powerful and ultimately a benefit to society. This guy should be in jail.

These articles, comments and upvotes drive me nuts. Bitcoin isn't a system for tax evasion or criminal behavior any more than the US greenback or gold bars are.
People keep on posting this anti-US and anti-government stuff in here as if bitcoin is some sort of magic bean. It's not &amp; that only brings with it this perspective that bitcoin people are some sort of army of radical tea party who are going all Che Guerra. It's crazy.
Also, since bitcoin has to be stored in cold wallets when you have lots of them, the government can just take the device. Sure, you can have it encrypted, but either way, you aren't getting those back. (Hot wallets can be taken too of course.) 
So why is this posted and upvoted here?

You all know the definition of right and wrong. He could have done this a million ways right. He could have allowed open conversations about the 2 different block chains and let people evaluate the merits.
Instead, he is out right misleading and defrauding people. I'm guessing the IRS is going to _love_ talking to him also.
