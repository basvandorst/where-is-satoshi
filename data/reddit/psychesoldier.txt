I have faith in IOTA technology 
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:32:53
How could the value even rise to 60k
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:36:00
Well said
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:01:51
Yuuuup! I’m actually making and selling any logo that people submit to me, it’s quite fun.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:48:36
That’s the mystery of it all �� that means I did my work well haha
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:35:45
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:44:17
I’m so glad this was posted on a subreddit that doesn’t exclusively deal with drugs. Thank you :D
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:32:01
Your opinion ��‍♂️ it’s the only one with gloss anyways, I wanted to see how it would turn out
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:31:08
What about IOTA?
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:09:52
When you say “scaling”, what does that mean?
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:34:03
Thanks mate! I’m probably going to make an Ethereum next. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:36:54
What would that be ��
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:55:14
No need to be pretentious ��
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:35:13
Or a Litecoin, personally, I think it would turn out great.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:16:52
Won’t happen
@_date: 2018-10-21 18:27:22
If only

So what’s your opinions on terms of ETH vs Bitcoin, will both be surpassed by perhaps something else? Or will ETH finally overtake BTC as “king?” 
Personally, I have trust in IOTA, they’re trying something quite new and have reputable backers.
@_date: 2019-01-09 13:08:24
You must not understand how the world works yet haha
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:16:22
Do you think ETH will overtake BTC in the coming months? What about IOTA?
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:35:22
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:34:46
What do you think will happen to all the cryptos as a whole? Would it be good to sell now and buy back if they get lower?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:02:21
I wouldn’t take any offense, quite honestly, you can be as real as you’d like. The more perspectives I can see the better.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:19:05
4 Million dollars really isn’t that much either, let’s see where he goes in the next 10 years.
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:29:44
It’s not a loss
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:19:50
*LOOK MA, NO HANDS!*

Care to explain what a second generation coin will be?
