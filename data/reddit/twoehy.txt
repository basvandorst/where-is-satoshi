Like everyone else in the comments, I'd point out that mabye you don't know what fungible means in practice.

Privacy sure, but what does this have to do with fungibility?

Alternative theory: Based on his post his biggest issue was with the intransigence of the big chinese miners control over the core. Drive the price of bitcoin down low enough, miners only choice to remain profitable is to cave to demands to raise the blocksize limit.

I looked into it. Living in California, it was actually considerably higher. Around $1800 to start, plus about $300/year after that. If you're investing less than $25,000 you should think very carefully about whether this makes financial sense.

Currently there's no way to hold bitcoin in a traditional IRA other than GBTC. You can open a self-directed Roth IRA, but there are considerable fees associated with this. This is the only really compelling reason to hold GBTC. IF the winklevoss twins can get their bitcoin ETF off the ground though, you can expect the price premium on GBTC to vanish, as the incentive to pay the insane premium (as of this writing it's 62%!) for the same thing will also vanish. If you're not trying to sneak some bitcoins into your Roth, it's better to go with coinbase. If you're really keen on owning bitcoins coinbase is probably not the best option either though. There are several exchanges, many of which are fairly easy to set up accounts on which have lower fees.
Coinbase arguably has very good security, but if you let them hold your bitcoins you're essentially trusting that they won't lose/ get hacked/steal/ your money. If you trust them not to lose your money more than you trust yourself (I know people like this) coinbase is just fine.

not really, no.

Oh yeah, that makes sense. Thanks.

*Edit misread what you wrote. 
The only way that would happen is (random variation aside, which should be small) if the global hashrate dropped over the previous two weeks. I see a couple points, were those due to BCH difficulty oscillations? Was there any other time it's gone down?

That's actually a reference to Ralph kramden from the honeymooners

That might be the worst 1st sentence of an article I've read in a long time. Could not get past it. I hope the article was good.

Might be I just googled it. There's always local bitcoins too

This is what I would say if I were undergoing a massive bitcoin acquisition.

Mining is not for hobbyists any more, and hasn't been for years. If you want to mine find an alt coin, if you want bitcoin just buy it. 
At this point it's like asking someone what's the best way to build their own tesla for under 10k. It's just not going to happen.

You could say the same thing about the blockchain, every day.

Short answer: yes, sometimes. Medium answer: Coin's can use whatever standard they choose, but many of them use the same Proof of Work as btc or eth.
What your asking about is called proof of work, and it varies from coin to coin. Bitcoin's PoW was originally done on GPU's, but people figured out that it could be done much more efficiently on an ASIC processor, which is what is used to mine btc now.
Ethereum specifically chose a slightly different PoW that is resistant to the benefits provided by ASIC, so it's still mined on GPU's. Still other coins have based it on Proof of Stake, which is based on storage capacity instead of processing power.
