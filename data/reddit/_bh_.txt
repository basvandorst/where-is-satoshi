I prefer the scenario where I take the necessary precautions but ultimately I keep my BTC count a secret. 
The only way you come to the attention of a motivated criminal is if they know you are sitting on a gold mine that they can just tease out of you through coercion. 
Unfortunately for me I don't have this problem because I don't hold enough BTC to be worth someone's while. But if I did I'd be keeping real quiet about it, and certainly not leaving it accessible on my PC.
That's the core of what I was trying to say. And I think it's the only real defense a crypto holder has.

They're considered secure until you get hacked. But now, instead of hacking your computer, the criminals will hack you.
Example: criminal finds out you have 100btc.
Criminal catches hold of you, cuts your little finger off, and tells you your balls are next unless you give him the 24 words.
Sounds fanciful but it's a lot easier than robbing a bank. Nothing to mastermind, any dimwit can do it.  And there are lots of dimwits out there with no other way to make lots of money than to take it from someone else.
People who have lots of btc should be very pleased with themselves. Quietly.

Agreed, that was the core of my point. There is ultimately no guaranteed safe way to keep your coins to yourself. A motivated person with Ill intent can always devise a way to get them out of you.
So best defence is to be discreet. Don't make it known that you have 50BTC or 100BTC etc

I also had a bad experience on LocalBitcoins where a review of neutral feedback resulted in the seller sending me threats. The threats were pretty strong as well, it made me feel glad that I had not traded with him after all and after that I lost confidence buying on that platform.

Facebook. The company whose business model is based entirely on the exploitation of private individuals' information.
Yes, let me give this company control over my finances as well. What could possibly go wrong.
