Oh ok, i was worried google docs isnt secure.

Do you mind sharing what the % of hits comes from these typo domains? I cant imagine many people manually enter addresses and those who do are less incompetent than avgguy.

And there's still no good way to buy bitcoin in germany that doesnt require your ID, residency proof, blood sample, retina scan and anal probing. Sad  :(

The odds are **never** in our favor.

So his firm invests in lottery tickets?

Yeah, how else could they afford a 5$ coffee every day and a new iphone every year off their minimum wage job at mcdonalds or walmart :(

Why are there spikes to 121-122 seconds and why only 121-122 and not say 150?

So why the fuck did microsoft get sued for billions because they only distributed IE with windows and "users had no choice in their webbrowser right from the start"? 
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:28:57
Yeah, and it offers great seller pro...no wait. as a seller youre totally fucked if youre selling virtual goods or services because of the buyer "protection" aka scam heaven.
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:53:39
Exceptionally well thought out post, except he doesn't address any security concerns brought up at all.

I'd be paying ~$4800 in germany. :|

Do you use your bank for  
a) The 1-4% annual interest  
b) safe storage  
c) Being able to transfer money relatively riskfree?  
Bitcoin can do b) and c) without banks and for a) there are better alternatives. So yes, id say bitcoin is a threat to banks. Not saying there wont be bitcoin banks, but they wont be a necessity.
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:30:52
Well no one forces you to buy windows either. Mcdonalds doesnt sell a BigKing and subway doesnt sell BigMacs. I dont see the difference. Windows is their product, if you dont want to use IE dont use windows. And that is completely ignoring the fact that you can just download another browser anyway.

Not necessarily. They probably lose money on this, but it will be wrote off as advertisement, which it is.

Isn't that against googles policy because it circumvents the play store payment methods?

Hm, havent heard of them before. Ill check it out, thanks.

Because it would have to be a really big circle to fit all those numbers... like 720° or something!

How do they differentiate between "real" virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and virtual currencies such as diablo3 gold or wow gold, which have been up on ebay for ages?  
And how do they prevent scams? It's incredibly easy to scam people buying gold, paying with paypal then charging the money back, how does this not apply to bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-28 01:11:27
Wait wait i dont follow you. How exactly do you go from clicking on a google drive document to entering your password to them getting the password? 
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:44:02
I'm surprised there isn't an app like this yet, at least as far as i know. Betting ingame and getting payout immediately would be incredibly nice, but i guess it falls under gambling and the app stores, both android and apple, wouldnt allow that.
@_date: 2014-01-05 17:54:41
I understand, but in light of all the recent headlines regarding NSA and whatnot, this is a turnoff for me.  
Still, even if i wanted i couldnt provide a proof of residency, as i live with roommates and there are no bills on my name and both the rental agreement and the official document from the german registration office are more than 3 months old.
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:11:52
There are dozens of internet creditcards that dont require any verification other than a bank account.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:26:24
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:38:22
But if you bought them with a public key that is linked to your private data through those services, every bitcoin transaction you do is traceable forever?
@_date: 2013-12-22 15:20:08
No, this is EXACTLY what bitcoin stands for. Zero fees means zero securities. It's the reverse paypal. Paypal fucks the seller, bitcoin fucks the buyer.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:27:04
Yes, i understand that. But thats not the case for SEPA is it? Why do all exchanges require me to upload my ID or drivers license and a proof of residency? This is the only thing that is stopping me from buying bitcoins right now. This shit is ridiculous in light of the recent NSA articles every day.  
If they were malevolent, what could they do with my ID/drivers license?
Edit: localbitcoins is not an option and virwox's double fees are too high, same goes for mobile phone purchases so thats not an option either.

You can install netlimiter or similar to limit traffic. Not ideal, but better than nothing while waiting for the implementation.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:32:12
Where can you trade anonymously? Bitstamp, btc-e and mtgox also want a scan of your ID and a proof of residence. Why not fingerprints and a blood sample too while theyre at it anyway?  
Bitcoin anonymity my ass.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:59:49
Well yes, but so does paypal or moneybookers or online creditcard companies, and they only require you to proof that its your bank account.  
ID and residency is just way too private to give out lightly to such an exchange. I cant imagine how many people were thinking "hm maybe i should look into this bitcoin thing", then they register at mtgox and nope the fuck out because of that.  
Then again, maybe im just too paranoid. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:21:21
I still don't get what exactly a credit card gives you. Here in germany, we just pay with our bankaccount directly and it requires a PIN so that you're not immediately fucked if it gets stolen. 
 I never had to use a cc until a few months ago, because google doesnt accept anything else.  
The only advantage i see in ccs is their international acceptance, but for online purchases there's paypal.

drop the 'the'
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:18:23
You are of course right. It is way too complicated AT THE MOMENT for it to really go mainstream. But there will hopefully be solutions. Bitcoin is in development and heavily so.  
You dont need a second computer however. You can burn any linux distribution on a dvd and boot it up from there, generate and print a key while being disconnected from the internet and harddrive. Its not really that complicated, just cumbersome.
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:09:57
Why does it have to be us based?
@_date: 2013-12-22 15:16:56
No shit. Does everyone think the securities banks and ccs offer are free?
