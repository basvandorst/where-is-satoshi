I got lucky and went into Alts about a week after my above post. Used almost all my BTC to buy into about 30 of them, still have about 5% of my portfolio in BTC (not by choice, it's just what was left when I stopped buying Alts). Since then my overall portfolio went up to nearly 100% in unrealized gains, but during this market-wide serious dip/crash in past few days, it touched red for the first time, and now back at around +20%. I'm not buy/selling anything and not trading anything since a while, instead I'll just wait for the long term to see what happens. Way I see it, it's like a lottery ticket. Either loose it all (or most of it) down the line, or get a nice reward in a few years.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:03:03
Exactly, while my BTC is up 10%, out of the 27 ALTS I own, 5 are up more than 400%, 10 more than 100%, and only 5 are red with the lowest at -28% (ITC). Go Bitcoin, but Go Alts too!

Thanks for the answer, but your examples are for current situation. I meant in an utopian/hypothetical future such as the one Satoshi imagined, where fiat is phased out and where everyone uses crypto currency only, since there are no limits to the number of wallets you can anonymously create, and you could send and receive funds from anyone and from anywhere.

So how did that work out for you? Looking at your comment history it seems you throw around a lot of short-term predictions that make it sound you know how to read the market, but as with most its seem you're full of all hot air in the end. Sorry to be blunt, I just call it as I see it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:18:37
I don't think you read or understood what I wrote. There is no panic involved here, where I stand I have nothing to lose by doing this and more to gain. Still planning on hodling long-term once I buy again, I'm just resetting when I enter the game, as I have a chance to rince and repeat.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:00:15
I would assume that that someone buying 20$ worth of BTC plans to hold and wish for the moon. But yeah, all these issues with BTC made me reduce my portfolio % holding of it considerably, but it's a double edge sword as when BTC falls, it seems almost every other crypto falls (although I must admit their recovery today was faster and stronger than expected)

Assuming your reply is sarcastic, I've made about 10 transactions this week, 2 of them took a little bit over 1 hr (because local exchange needed 7 confirmations), and the other eight about 20 minutes each. Are transactions from exchange to exchange prioritized then? If that's the case, I should mention that my final transaction of my main BTC to my Nano also took less than 30 minutes... are there really people paying 20$ TX fees and having to wait 3-4 days? If so that's ridiculous, but on what is it based? Luck? Again, what am I missing here?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:37:51
I'm not looking for praise, I'm new at investing, and I know it's all a gamble in the end. I just think that hodling applies when you're still in profit, but afraid of losing from your gains. Not when you've just entered the game near the ATH. In my case I have nothing to lose right now (sold at what i bought for a couple days ago) and something to gain (chance of buying back more BTCs to start with). Am I missing something here?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:41:55
Good for you, hope you keep it up. I too started gaining before I got hit with that crazy spike that went from 14k to 16k in barely an hour, right after I sold at what looked like a peak... good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:16:34


I never said that. 
Look at my comments history, I keep saying to buy only what you can afford to lose. It's all a gamble anyways, but since I just bought in near the ATH and the coin just started to crash/correct at an alarming rate, I figured it wasn't a bad gamble to try it out, at that particular time given the signs. Luckily I guessed correctly. Do whatever you want, I'm just sharing my luck, not educating gamblers on how to gamble!
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:33:49
 Your original comment now makes 100% sense, I stand corrected.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:55:06
That too. But you also can't lose the farm if you don't sell the farm.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:59:12
Buy only if you can afford to lose it all. Confidence is high that it will go up (myself included), but nobody can read the future.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:56:46
and what you did is skim my post without reading it properly and then simply regurgitated what half this sub is repeating without understanding fully what hodling means. 
Hodling vs. panic selling is only applicable when you are losing from your GAINS at an alarming rate, not when you are about to lose from your ORIGINAL capital, and especially not when you have just bought in 48 hours ago.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:09:08
must've* (must have)
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:42:53
True, that's why I put a limit order to automatically buy if it goes up to 15K... which is where I just sold at earlier today. If not, then I have a chance to re-enter the game with a little bit more BTCs. I don't see what I have to lose, other than the relatively low commission fees my exchange sets... unless I'm missing something (new at investing).
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:11:58
like the gold bubble?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:32:39
I can't predict future, but I just increased my BTC holding by 23% without adding a single dollar out of my pocket. Could've increased more if it dipped lower.

Lol did you even read my post? I bought again at 14.5k as it was going back up, getting slightly little more bitcoins for my same original amount of fiat cash... in the end it was not worth it for **3%** more bitcoins (15/14.5) and 4 hours of my time monitoring it, but could have been worth it had it dipped to say 12k, where I could have gained **25%** more bitcoins, with nothing to lose expect my time monitoring the rate.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:45:42
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:57:40
I set a buy limit at 15k lol... if it reaches that I'm back where I was just before I sold, less the tiny commission fee that my exchange charges for limit orders :P
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:58:01
Well I for one am clueless to some extent, but I've read enough to decide to "gamble" what I can afford to lose on it. When it was at 750 about a year ago and someone said it would reach 14.5K by December (i.e. 20x) someone else probably also said "no no no you people are clueless". So why not this time?

What makes you think there will be a dip then? The opposite happened when CBOE started...
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:34:43
Well my main argument is that I have just entered the game last week. I don't plan on day trading since I'm new at investing. It's just that I have just entered at 14.2k, momentarily enjoyed a nice 15% gain, and now it's dipping lower than my buy in cost from a few days ago. I believe hodl applies when you're afraid of loosing from your gains, not from your original investment. Say I bought in 2 weeks ago at 7.5k, I would be much more inclined to hodl right now since I'm still in the profit. Am I missing something here?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:05:03
No man it's in your head, earlier GDAX was at 11000 while Bitfinex was at 11600, it's rare but it happens. Each exchange follows offer/demand from its traders. There may be manipulation, but I doubt the exchanges themselves care, they just care about volume transacted, the more fees they collect.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:40:12
I have no idea what's going to happen, but worst case I buy back in at 15k with zero loss, best case is I get a little more BTCs if price drops a little.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:54:47
Speak for yourself, whales will only remain (i.e. re-become) potential whales if you sell out most of your bitcoins to them for their depreciating fiat. Nothing wrong with cashing out though, it's your money you do what you want.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:17:12
I'm hodling my BTC but I'm no longer sure it will be THE crypto in the future... it grew too fuckin fast for its own good... newer and technologically better cryptos have already proven they can potentially and maybe eventually take over (and I'm not talking about Ver's scamcoin). I think it would be wise to diversify your cryptofolio even if 2-3 coins (i went full retard and spread in to 5 main coins and about 25 up and comers)

Doesn't hurt to diversify, even if just a little bit. How's your myspace account doing?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:18:56
What I meant is that Bitcoin does not need to be used for transactions as it originally was intended for for it to potentially become the new gold standard. Not saying that it will, but it just might. Also I just reread the original comment you were replying to, and your reply to it makes more sense now. My reply to you was about the bubble burst part, which is not necessarily a given despite the crazy rise; BTC is the first of its kind, a digital virtual commodity and no one can predict how it will eventually play out. HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:13:34

@_date: 2017-12-22 09:40:37
First, thanks for not insulting me straight out of the gates like most replies up to now. Second, yes it is a gamble, but given the mass hysteria by all newcomers and the media I "guessed" that the dip was going to be much lower than 16K when it reached that point, and eventually go back up. Yes it may crash some more now, but whatever happens I still hold 23% more BTC. I'm not planning on repeating this, unless we see a spike again and mass hysteria followed by mass dumping again, maybe that time i will sell then buy just a small percentage of my coins, hopefully "gambling with unrealized profits" instead of actual out of pocket capital.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:39:01

@_date: 2017-12-10 06:44:57
The way I understand it is when you are panicking because you're loosing from your GAINS at an alarming rate, that's when you HODL. I don't think hodling applies when you've just entered the game near the ATH and have a chance to restart just a few days later but with a little bit more BTCs.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:56:06
Here's a cheesy quote for you: "Be the change you want to see in the world". Personally, I don't blame the whales, but if there's even a small shot for me to take that could help me become one, without prejudice to anyone, I will take it if I can.

My local/regional exchange uses Bitfinex's platform and prices, and I had no choice but to use them since they're the only exchange available for the country where I reside to deposit FIAT in.
Their BTC price (buy and sell) was **always** lower by about $500 compared to GDAX, at least since I started trading 2 weeks ago, even when the price was still sky rocketing going up, not only just now. (I started buying at about 10k price, i.e. 10.5k on GDAX, unfortunately with a very low limit allowed in first week)
*tl;dr: there is no conspiracy here, their price was lowest since I started monitoring the BTC 2 weeks ago, even when price was going up, not just now.*
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:51:30
No worries my man. Since you are a self-proclaimed beginner, forget about what I wrote then, as you can't really go wrong with just hodling... most probable success strategy long-term.

Yes I put in a limit buy order (not sure if that's the proper term) at 15k just in case it sky rocketed while I was busy or just not looking, but ended up buying manually just before it got there (it was sky rocketing lol, went up from 14k to 16k in about 1 hour!)

I wish I read that about 4 hours ago... thought id sell the high and buy the dip to round-up my BTC amount to a nice even number... instead lost a relatively small fraction after an intense 4 hours of staring and shouting at my screen...
Now back to hodling, while hoping that small fraction lost will be worth millions down the line... that'd be a good problem to have.

OP here, and I absolutely believe (i.e. ready to gamble/invest) that the BTC will only go up on the long term, after not only this correction but probably throughout the many more to come. I just feel that since I have just entered the game a couple of days ago, I have nothing to lose by doing what I just did...

@_date: 2017-12-22 09:45:24
True, that's why I don't plan on doing that again. I figured I'd take the risk given all the mass hysteria caused by newcomers and it looked like it was free falling anyways, so yes it was a gamble, but I figured it was worth taking given all the signs at that time. Not planning to do it again, maybe at the next spike/correction in a few months/years, but with a small percentage of my BTC, not all of them like this time.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:24:11
I personally think we're not done with current stage 4, I expect a mini-correction again to 10-11k before we get into stage 1 again.

I could have bought anywhere under 16K and still gotten more BTC... I ended up buying at a little more than 13K, after it crossed it back up from 12.5K (on Bitfinex). 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:58:01
Nobody can answer that. Don't believe anyone who says they can read the future. We're all BETTING that bitcoin will reach the moon. If you're worried about single day fluctuation, don't buy. If you buy at 17k now, or wait and it goes down to 14k or up to 20k, it won't matter much on the long-run in terms of what you're betting on. You'll either have a little bit more or a little bit less bitcoins yes, but you would still be betting on it to be worth much more down the line.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:26:53
Uhm... i just bought a small amount at 11.8k earlier today, how is 13.5k critical? Also my wild guess based on past mini crashes is that it will double-triple dip to 9.5k or 10k on the short term, and who knows after that if it will repeat 2013-2014 post-crash of calming down on the long term for a few months/years before bubbling up again 10-fold, or just go back up quickly like the six times it did this year.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:21:48
It didn't fail lol, I actually ended up with about 3% more bitcoins. Probably not worth it for the time I spent monitoring the rate, but it could have been had it dipped slightly more instead of stalling at a 14k low (I bought back at about 14.5k as it was rising up again)

I can't dumb it out more than that. And I now realise you didn't care to read and just troll commented... whatever dude, good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:30:52
He didn't say how much he bought, maybe he bought 20$ worth...
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:22:06
Holding during a dip from 19.5k to 12k after buying at 13k is much easier than holding same dip when you bought at 18k... just saying. Obviously those with most incentive to hold are the very early adopter who entered much earlier...
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:20:04
Don't beat yourself up, you would probably have sold a little later anyways. Hindsight is always 20/20. Millions have been in your shoes and millions more will, fuck it. Time and moments are more valuable than anything, it's the only real currency we have and there are no refunds, so spend it wisely and try not to worry too much about the past or the future along the way. Xox

Thanks for sharing.

Why? I have nothing to lose, with the chance to re-enter the game with a few more BTCs then when I started just a couple of days ago... I'm new at investing but I think my logic checks out, am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:59:34
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:13:54
Me neither, thus the title of my post lol.

What's TA?
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:18:16
Yeah, another comment pointed it out... first is from Dec '13 to June '14, and second is from Dec '17 to June '19. Anyways, given most the comments till now, it seems it's not clear from the title that I'm definitely not abiding by my train of thought from last week when I made this chart, and am back in "who the fuck knows" territory lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:05:04
MAH MAN!
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:14:23
I think we might see 6k... even 5k... (my amateur crystal ball charts tell me theoretical bottom at 3k but my flawed emotions tell me not possible)... then next ATH/bubble in 2021. I'll definitely buy some more at 8k tho... FOMO and all.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:59:24
In my defense, not totally random... i was just comparing the relative price behavior between last bubble and previous bubble... past performance is no guarantee of future results, but BTC has been acting out a series of exponentially-growing bubbles since inception, so it's not totally ludicrous to except a 5th or 6th one moving forward...
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:22:46
Or maybe it's just a micro-recovery like it did in June 2014?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:22:34
Lol, chill dude, I can feel you getting all rattled behind your screen. It's not worth it, I'm just a random stranger on reddit. And good for you with the sale, hopefully you made some profits, that's all that matters.
PS: No, I have never been in a fist fight. But I've been called a smart-ass before, and it's probably not the last time. Xox.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:05:57
What I'm saying (or rather what I was saying last week when we were at 8k), that this was just a temporary rebound and we would go back down until the next real bubble. But now I have no idea, this sudden surge is phenomenal and much sooner than expected.


I don't get what peak you refer too. My images compares the 2014 temporary rebound with what I thought was a 2019 similar temporary rebound.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:00:59
Thank you for your valued feedback, redditor for 3 months.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:12:29
Then you will probably feel it is even more condescending that I am not at all surprised by how you chose to interpret and reply to my candid response to your question, despite my genuine attempt to put it in the most delicate way I could. Good luck then.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:13:01
Sorry I'm still not sure I follow. What I was showing last week at time of making the chart was that this surge at that time (8k and climbing) may not be the next bubble we are waiting for, but just a temporary rebound... same as happened in 2014 after the last bubble. But obviously now I' have no idea anymore since we're nearly at 14k barely a week later lol.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:21:33
Haha yep, that's exactly what I was trying to do back in those days (i.e. last week lol)... I'm now back where I belong... in "who the fuck knows" territory ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:15:14
True. And I'm not standing by it anymore lol, thus the title of my post... I'm back to "who the fuck knows" lol.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:01:56
Yeah I was expecting a very slow fall to 5k range, and then an equally slow rise from there till the next bubble effect somewhere in 2021 with a new ATH somewhere and a repeat of the whole cycle at a higher scale. But now I'm back to "who the fuck knows" lol, was not expecting so soon this sudden surge to nearly 14k now.

All your comments are valid, except the "identifying with Bitcoin" part.
You don't have to believe in BTC as THE crypto that will be default digital store of value of the future to make some money out of it. I for one have no idea if it will be, but I believe it will continue its cycle of exponentially rising bubbles for at least one more, and intend to capitalize on it this time around. (and maybe keep some or a lot of it for the next one, and the next, etc... and who knows, maybe it will become the international standard).
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:27:14
Also many people had never heard of crypto last time around (including me), and now much more individuals and masses already have online verified accounts and can get on the bandwagon much faster this time around, so despite my limited knowledge I believe we should witness unseen levels of fomo-driven price surges, same as we're seeing lately. But what do I know, lol...
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:35:38
Lol! This is pure ~~gold~~ BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:04:30
I am actually valuing your words based on the absolute lack of arguments you presented to back up your arbitrary statements. You probably missed that while reading my reply as I see you chose to stick with your original play-the-victim/oppressed defense mechanism.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:23:34
If you can't figure that out, you should not be investing in anything.
I don't mean to sound rude or condescending, but honestly get mentoring or supervision from someone close (i.e. not reddit) to help you if you really wanna invest in anything.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:16:58
It would be: 
"Thank you for your valued feedback, polishjake, especially the strong arguments to back your statements and the irrefutable reasoning you have presented."
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:16:55
Glad that you agree, but it's not like it was debatable. It was a factual statement, not an opinion.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:08:05
