Why is it necessary to commit funds to a payment channel thereby tying up your bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:12:51
Can someone explain this: ??????????
(LN wallet meaning it's able to use the LN and Bitcoin)
1) Say I want to buy something from Amazon. I use the LN and I set my LN wallet to finds the route that has a low fee which I set in the settings. It does this.
2) Then I want to buy something from Newegg. Also use my LN wallet to send bitcoins to Newegg and they send me my order.
3) I want to buy something from Ebay, etc. Same thing.
My question is: 
A) Who the heck do I open my "payment channel" with? I obviously have to commit a large amount of my bitcoins to a payment channel in order to be able to buy and pay for all the things I want to buy and pay for.
B) What do you call that "opening a payment channel" to be able to do this? Sounds to me just like opening a checking account at a bank. (I know all about how banks work and that it's not fractional reserve banking so don't deal with that now)

Technically BCH continues the Bitcoin blockchain from the point before Segwit so it is Bitcoin.

No you can't. You can see on the blockchain which address the bitcoins came from.

Here is a video for your education about whether the KYC racket being perpetrated by officials is a good idea. The video addresses other topics as well. 
What if a law abiding citizen wanted to do countless of $50 trades one after another? It's not good business sense to label or assume your customers are criminals. Criminals don't use bitcoin ATMs, they use the HSBC bank which made boxes to make it easier for criminals to break the law. Of course when government officials are the criminals they can get away with it.
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:24:51
Then how do people discuss that topic? It's ridiculous  to censor an important topic which needs discussing and info.
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:12:08
It's not negative. The blocksize DOES need to be increased but the guy who wrote the blacklist code snuck in a deceptive process that can undermine the nature of what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2015-09-20 20:21:05
It will take about $10 million to make large profits mining bitcoins but you can still aquire bitcoins by asking your employer or customers to pay you partly in bitcoins. That way you can save bitcoins and things like what the government in Cyprus did, i.e. the bail-in stealing money from your bank account, can't happen to your bitcoins.

The best way to grow your BTC holdings is probably to work for a salary in BTC. If you mean increase i value then just hold on to them for a few years. If you want to increase awareness then ask everywhere you buy things if they accept BTC and if they don't provide them with a short easy to understand explanation of what it is and maybe start a bitcoin wallet for them.

If you don't want to use your bitcoins immediately you can buy them non-anonymously and then use anonymizers later to obfuscate the origin making them anonymous.
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:09:23
You misunderstand my reply. The blacklist function is something laymen don't understand and it takes control away from clients and centralizes it. A little at first but then once people are use to it they will take more control.

There are no leaders. If people accept whatever features are in the protocol by using it then it becomes prevalent and is used. Presumably people wouldn't accept something in the protocol that hurts their "bottom line".

How do you deal with identity theft? Many stores like Target were hacked and credit card numbers that were supposed to be kept private were released. With all this private info you and other bitcoin ATMs and exchanges gather it's us the customers that are at risk. Bitcoin being semi-anonymous was supposed to solve the problem of identity theft but the bitlicense sham of a law makes identity theft worse. How do we know and how can we be assured that our info is safe? That's a problem for bitcoin ATMs and exchanges.
@_date: 2015-09-20 00:42:02
Why do we need to provide a cell phone number? That is absurd! You want our business, we provide you with 50 dollars and in exchange you provide us with $50 worth of bitcoins. To ask for anything more is abusive.

That whole system is a gross violation of privacy. I know you're just following the sociopath regulators orders but it's still like slavery. The whole system of the regulations is to prevent people from escaping the tyranny imposed by QE and debt slavery.
@_date: 2015-09-30 04:20:47
Good idea but I don't think the bitcoin transaction rate is fast enough to handle that. Blocksize would need to increase alot for it to work.
@_date: 2015-09-20 20:16:45
I have no idea about hacking. However there is one security risk that I think the bitlicense politicians haven't thought about and don't care about. If bitcoin ATMs collect phone numbers then those phone numbers can be linked to other personal info like from the Target hack then the criminals would have address info for the bitcoin ATM customers. Of course all that wouldn't be an issue if regulators and politicians care about the people they serve.

Um nope. It's a collusion between the government and the banks. The banks control themselves by a banking cartel called the Federal Reserve System. The government gives them the excuse to do what they do by deceiving people into thinking it's good for the people.

I understand all this and sorry for giving you a hard time about it and understand you are forced to do this by our elected criminals who let drug dealers use HSBC without punishment but they're trying to prevent law abiding citizens from lawfully trying to use bitcoins cause they can't steal from them like they did in Cyprus. I'm just trying to make a point. However you really should try to phrase your descriptions of the procedures better as it does sound like you're assuming all customers are criminals.

The bitcoin network doesn't have enough capacity yet (meaning the blocksize is too small) for widespread adoption.
@_date: 2015-09-30 11:16:22
Here in the US the bitcoin ATMs require you to identify yourself with something the government can track you with like and ID.
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:05:48
The point is, from what I read, that someone else (in this case the central server which sends the clients the blacklist) is setting the parameters. It's control from outside the bitcoin network and it identifies client IP address thereby making people vulnerable.
@_date: 2015-09-30 04:02:56
He is making a very ignorant comment. The fact that bitcoin has a monetary value is due to all the people who want to use it because they are willing to trade stuff and labor for it.
If only criminals used it it would be useless.

Yes they are in the US because the banks don't like competition.

Don't forget banks cannot freeze your bitcoins (as long as you have control of your wallet).
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:03:01
To and anyone else:
Let's say the bitcoin core developers implement a blocksize increase to 8MB. It means at some point **if** most of the miners use the new code that at some point after that 8MB blocks will be valid.
Now let's say that most of the miners use BitcoinXT and the number of BIP101 blocks mined is the amount set by XT then 8MB blocks will be valid.
**The situation is the same and a hard fork will occur in BOTH cases!** What's so effffiing hard to understand?? Your position is illogical!
@_date: 2015-09-30 15:41:40
The "feature" as you call it that is a danger is the blacklist function in the XT client. It let's people outside the network control who is allowed to use bitcoin. It's not that extensive yet but it will become worse.
@_date: 2015-09-19 00:13:59
If someone wants to buy $50 worth of bitcoins do they need an ID and a contract to sell their firstborn to the IRS? (kidding about the contract)
@_date: 2015-09-30 16:02:31
I think it has to be 20MB *before* the next financial crash in 2016. 
8MB is too small to handle 10's or 100's millions of new people using it day.

They can freeze your bank account. The Fed policies will do the rest to devalue your cash meaning you'll get to find out your cash will be able to buy less and less every month/year.

No. Actually I started this topics so we can get clear rules on what topics will be censored so people can know what not to discuss on It's not my fault that mods censor topics and that it looks bad for them and but that's the nature of censorship. SO can we get clear rules?
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:56:40
I didn't know about until just now. I'm sure others didn't either.
@_date: 2015-10-01 14:03:30
Of course. Governments want to be able to steal people money which they can't do if people use bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-10-01 16:43:38
Well some politicians are loudly advocating eliminating physical cash for that very reason so you won't be able take it out of the bank and put it under a mattress (QE would still devalue your cash even if you did that).
About loans, do you seriously believe that a bank would lend to you if you had to pay back less than what you borrowed? That will never happen.
@_date: 2015-10-01 13:54:14
Sorry but I'm pretty sure the proof of work is per block not per transaction.

No I didn't. You probably misunderstood. You implied that your money is safe cause the Fed won't decrease your purchasing power but with negative interest rates and bail-ins the Fed would steal your money from you and you would have less to spend on what you need or want thereby accomplishing something similar.
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:14:38
There is **no** next level without a blocksize increase except if the blocksize increase comes from XT then all hope is lost.
@_date: 2015-10-01 16:16:24
From 
The body of the block contains the transactions. These are hashed only indirectly through the Merkle root. **Because transactions aren't hashed directly, hashing a block with 1 transaction takes exactly the same amount of effort as hashing a block with 10,000 transactions.**
@_date: 2015-10-14 01:34:51
Ok I might do that if I ever feel has any credibility left, in my opinion. If you'd like you might try searching instead for "blocksize" and not BIP 101 since they're the same thing for me (i.e. Bitcoin XT is the only popular client that implements BIP 101 as far as I know.)
@_date: 2015-10-13 23:46:42
I have **never** promoted the client and **I did try to ask about BIP 101** but the **mods** deleted the posts and comments I made in Really is a lost cause at this point. Maybe whoever runs it should just give it to someone who understands free speech and transparency and doesn't have an another agenda .
@_date: 2015-10-01 04:38:56
There's a misunderstanding about XT which is BIP 101 increases the blocksize which could be added other clients too. But XT adds some other "features" one of which blacklisting IP addresses thereby having an outside entity control the bitcoin network, eventually.
People should understand that it's BIP 101 that increases the blocksize not XT. Gavin just happened to add it to the XT client.
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:36:45
I think he's kidding.

Don't be so sure. Lookup "negative interest rates" and "bail-ins".
@_date: 2015-10-13 08:12:56
As I said, and you obviously don't read or comprehend or maybe incapable of comprehending,
mods, and admins, **censor** without notice or explanation while pretending this is a open forum for discussion thus giving people the *illusion* that they are having and honest discussion with other people on reddit. I wouldn't have a problem with mods and admins **if** mods and admins made it clear that they censor and list the topics that will be censored. You obviously have no knowledge of history and of what despots and dictators have done and are still doing similar things in their authoritarian regimes.
If you understood English or had the skill of reading comprehension, then you would understand that I said "protest" in the context of how authoritarian regimes crush dissent.
Sorry but there is no further point having an intelligent discussion with you.
@_date: 2015-10-15 00:32:23
But it's clear from his comment he wasn't talking about any of those obvious cases. Sorry don't have time to debate this.
@_date: 2015-10-01 13:31:32
QE, quantitative easing, is devaluing the currency. QE is causing problems in the economy and the idiots at the Fed think negative interest rates and bail-ins will solve the problems they created themselves. 
Spending doesn't help the economy. Bail-ins are not a restructuring of debt. Basically it will look like the following. Well connected individuals and corporations offload their bad debts onto the public, the public then is stuck paying for those bad debts. That's basically bail-ins.
Negative interest rates are just another way of stealing people's.
@_date: 2015-10-12 03:01:52
There's a solution to that. This is supposed to be a free market of ideas. Let's move the discussions to another subreddit where they don't censor info and discussions. People can post links to a freer subreddit periodically. Has anyone create one?
@_date: 2015-10-14 00:33:33
This discussion is going off-topic. Let's just say BIP 101 is the **blocksize increase** in Bitcoin XT.

You're mistaking the prices of the amount people buy with the price of 1 BTC. Yes peoples holdings of BTC has gone down in value compared to the dollar this and 2014 but when people buy BTC at varying prices they don't actuall buy 1 whole BTC, they buy a certain dollar amount of BTC.

If the demand increases the price will rise but it can't work if the blocksize is small.

@_date: 2015-10-01 17:09:04
Yeah but do you think a bank will make loans under those conditions? The negative interest rate are meant to prevent people from saving money or holding money. It's basically an overt form of theft by the government were as with QE the inflate away people's saving so that people didn't realize what they were doing.
@_date: 2015-10-08 17:11:38
Is that based on actual data from the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-10-01 14:00:02
Negative interest rates example:
You deposit $1,000 and leave in the bank where the policy is 5% negative interest rate. At the end of the year you have $950 in the bank.
Bail-ins is like what happened in Cyprus not what you're reading about.
@_date: 2015-03-01 13:44:52

I may not understand who has "shadow banning" power on reddit but that's not an argument against or for my comment. What I said about censorship, I think, is supported by history.

@_date: 2015-10-10 15:18:17
Only if demand goes up and **if** the bitcoin network can keep up and that won't happen without a blocksize increase with something like BIP 101.
@_date: 2015-10-01 04:31:25
Careful. All discussions of XT are censored in soviet reddit. The blocksize increase is good but with XT it can be use to blacklist people and boot them from the bitcoin network.

Your honor, the third sentence discusses the topic.
@_date: 2015-10-12 19:13:59
The worst kind of censorship exists in Mods not only censor topics but they delete comments so other users can't them but deceive the original commentators into thinking that their posts still exist, which I recently found out is called **shadow banning**.
Such tactics are used by Orwellian regimes to crush decent. Worst of all the mods don't admit that it's their policy to censor because they want to deceive people into thinking that is an open forum so they won't leave. I have lost all respect for the mods on @_date: 2015-10-12 03:50:41
I didn't say it doesn't need moderation but we all know what censorship looks like and we see it in Discussing an important topic such as blacklists and *"the client which shall remain unnamed cause he will delete the post"* is important but censoring such topics is not moderation but selfish and infantile. It shows there is another agenda in and that agenda is not honest discussions.
@_date: 2015-10-13 23:42:07
I may be wrong since I'm new here but I think he's saying it from experience not trolling. I've heard other reddit users had similar experiences. You, StarMaged, need to be less judgmental of users of reddit. You shouldn't be warning users for expressing an opinion especially without further discussion as to the circumstances and history.
@_date: 2015-10-12 12:50:17
They don't give a list of topics the mods decided they don't want people to read or talk about. In other words they don't give people a list of topics which they are censoring.
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:29:21
I know it's not the only one but I think it's the most reasonable one so far, IMHO.
@_date: 2015-10-12 05:47:21
Not when the mods feel the *need to protect* people from forming their own opinions and *censoring* people from topics the mods think people shouldn't read.
@_date: 2015-10-01 17:37:45
You can make a lot of money if you get equipment that can do 1 petahashes per second and if you pay nothing for electricity. Then you would make $1624.83 per day or 6.89 BTC per day.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:08:55
At the point that happens bitcoin, the protocol, has to have in place the proposed features of large block size in order to make the network scale to handle thousands of transactions per second.
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:13:41
Yeah I realized that looking at that page. Those first 50 BTC rewards each go to different addresses each time they're mined. I don't understand why that is. Did the bitcoin software generate a new address each time tta blocked was solved?
@_date: 2015-10-01 05:13:46
meaning what? If you understand economics (not Keynesian) you'll understand why bitcoin is better.
@_date: 2015-10-01 12:52:56
Bail-ins happened in Cyprus and capital controls happened in Greece and I think Cyprus. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen mentioned negative interest rates as something they might do and there's also talk of doing it in England.
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:42:55
As I said in a previous comment, for me I think it's too late for that. If mods have deleted comments before when people bring that up how can I trust that I'm having an honest discussion in this forum, that important posts for or against those issues are not being deleted? That's the problem with censorship, people lose trust in the forum and can't know if they're getting a real discussion or being manipulated into a false picture of reality.

Let me ask you and other mods an honest question:
When mods delete posts without notice or explanation to the community of reddit readers, how can we trust the forum? How do we know the mods didn't delete posts or comments that might have some important info? How do we know mods are not doing it to advance their agenda?
Are we supposed to take their word for it as "just trust us mods"?
Can you not see that the censorship the mods have been doing undermines the whole forum? Have you learned nothing from history?

Let see. The roles of government, U.S., lately have been to start wars, spy on people, drone weddings, start proxy wars in the Ukraine to cut off the gas to Europe so they can build an alternate gas line through Syria, ... So do you mean the government bought off by the insiders whose bidding the government does or do you mean accountable services that citizens want? Cause the government isn't accountable and they just keep getting money even if they screw up what they promised to do.
Roads and other services should be done by companies whose continued profitability depends on the value they provide to the users of those services and those services should improve with increase technology. Roads and other government services don't. Government is just like a criminal organization who demand extortion money from people for screwing up people's lives.

Meaning you can't imagine what a few years technology will look like or what's possible. Of course 1980 was 34 years ago and I don't want to wait 20 years for bitcoin to scale. From what I read it seems like hundreds of transaction per seconds will be doable soon and what the bitcoin blockchain can't handle other high value altcoins like litecoins and zerocash should be able to handle for smaller amounts.

Don't be so quick to dismiss the idea. This is not a new idea and there is precedent in history. The point is the so xcalled "government of the people" is not of the people and is not accountable to the people. The people have become the slaves of an oligarchy and putting a new spin on a corrupt government is not going to fix anything.

Because there is talk that the Fed might institute "negative interest rates" which mean they will be taking money out of people's bank accounts and if that doesn't work they may try bail-ins. In that case people might try bitcoin because the government can't touch their money.
I agree it needs to be much easier for the layperson to manage. It's already very easy to use but managing it and doing backups to paper and other things is harder for people to grasp. However people seem to manage tons of paperwork for bank accounts and other stuff so maybe it's not that different.

The block size was originally 32MB with I think plans to not have limits on the size. It was changed to 1MB to prevent spam transactions but bitcoins are worth more now so I don't think spam transactions are a problem anymore. Not an expert so maybe I don't understand it well enough.
@_date: 2015-02-11 00:10:44
That's what I read too that it would be about 1 TB per year. You don't absolutely have to have the whole blockchain. If I understood what I read you could prune it, like every year before this one, and just use a hash for the part where you prune it and you could still verify all newer transactions. Only a few nodes could still keep older larger archives and you could download it from them if you need to.
In that case 1 TB isn't so bad. I could easily do that as I'm sure many others could too.

He may be referring to theymos? I don't know theymos or his income source but I remember reading about other users saying the same thing when they criticize Blockstream, not all of them on reddit. 
In any case, this is a dangerous attitude for mods to take. Consider NSA spying on US citizens and other spying agencies in other countries spying on their citizens. That type of behavior by those governments puts a chilling effect on free speech and the citizens of those countries become afraid and watch what they say. The same type of effect happens on when mods censor and warn users for expressing their opinions.

They didn't replace the protocols. We still use the TCP/IP protocol which was created/updated in 1980, i.e. IPv4 which means version 4. Miners replace mining equipment every few months when the difficulty makes older miners unprofitable so some equipment IS being replaced. Experts say with some adjustments bitcoin can scale. Faster protocols like litecoin I think scale more likeusing litecoins for everyday small purchases and using bitcoins for large purchases.
EDIT: to add created/updated  about TCP/IP

Tried again different topic different words, never having experienced that kind of censorship and though that maybe it's a reddit error, and it was deleted again.
Then also shadow banning started, which is a deceptive way of fooling people making them think their comments are their when everyone else can't see them, which is what cowardly authoritarian regimes do to trick people into not protesting the regimes actions making people think that if no one else comments then people don't support the protest action.
 Shadow banning is a basically lying to reddit users and it's one of the worst deceptions to fool people into think (or reddit) is an open forum with consistent rules.
