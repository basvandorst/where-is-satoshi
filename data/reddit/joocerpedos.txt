What crackhead have you ever heard of using fucking Venmo to buy $5 of crack. Thanks for proving my point though.

Fixed for the real world.

I mean, government will compel you with violence.

Next year, halvening is my guess.
That's a *guess* though.
@_date: 2019-03-03 16:24:43
Ah right, because instead we should just bend over backwards for China to fuck us, like Obama did /s

Is sending encrypted text over unencrypted radio banned, or just encrypted radio itself (different than just encrypting X data and sending it via radio, e.g., military fast switching radio that cycles over 1 million channels per second for encrypted network communication)?

Not to mention other privacy features that are in the pipeline.
@_date: 2019-03-04 17:31:03
10 years ago even that would be unheard of for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-04 18:20:26
Sounds like a plus to me. LMAO
@_date: 2019-03-03 16:25:07
That's retarded and so are you.
@_date: 2019-03-02 19:24:18
Probably not with Venmo they don't.
@_date: 2019-03-05 01:47:29




My sides.
Good post though.
@_date: 2019-03-01 16:58:08
Yeah now they'll be selling your financial and personal data to terrorists instead of just giving them malware.

Imagine actually thinking that a database entry "costs money" if the number stored in it is low.
No sorry, it doesn't cost anything to have "small balance" accounts.
@_date: 2019-03-02 19:23:14
Which is why Venmo is fucking trash. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 16:59:41
Ah so it's kind of an interesting case here... the "meaning" of the message might be argued to be unambiguous even if the exact values aren't known.
I wonder if there are any cases that have set precedent that would affect it for Bitcoin.

Keep voting to pay taxes for illegal invaders, that's real smart.

He didn't suck down and repeat the propaganda line, so it must be a misrepresentation /s
IMF claiming something is good doesn't make it so, guy. You sound like a shill for globalist fiat fraud.

Ah HackingTeam...well known for selling malware to terrorists. Anyone associated with them is a subhuman piece of shit who needs to be in Gitmo.
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:21:47
Because they are morons. Their system should always assume the most common meaning of "DCB", not the most obscure.

Will Bitcoin ever recover from CME?

2nd/3rd tax bracket != "the rich"
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:22:50
LMAO of course. Globalists are low IQ.
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:20:55
But a $7.00 transaction with the note "Cuban" does *NOT* in fact denote an illegal transaction, jokingly or otherwise. That's sort of the point.
Only someone who is brain damaged would think otherwise.
$7.00 literally isn't even *enough* to buy anything illegal.
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:13:52


HAHAHHAHAHAHHA Holy shit, and you think other people sound dumb.
Marx is famous for helping murder 100 million people with his ideology that only imbeciles buy into.

Khashoggi was a Muslim Brotherhood terrorist.
