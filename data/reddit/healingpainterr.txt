because they think they have a say in protocol changes like 2x n00bie.  yet.... they don't even commit to code for protocol changes.  interesting.  UASF and NO2X showed that corporations/miners do not control bitcoin.  users do.  futures markets said 2x coin was valued at around 10% and original BTC was valued at 90% value.  users determine bitcoin.  not coinbase, not the govt, not jihad wu, not over 90% of the miners.  USERS and USERS ALONE.

apparently it is comparable.  surely you can see bitcoin is freedom yes?  bitcoin is self-sovereignty.  now, in a democracy, are you at the whim of the majority?  in a republic, is there a free market of sovereign folk?  surely you can answer these.

it's decentralized and has the best cryptographers in the world working on it.  and guess what those cryptographers say?  that altcoins are crap.  
it doesn't have a centralized team.  Core is NOT centralized.  ANYONE can commit to it.  UASF and NO2X showed that it is decentralized.  it is TESTED for decentralization.  all other altcoins are FANTASIES.  
those are the facts.  no other altcoin has been truly tested like bitcoin.  no other altcoin has been running as long.  no other coin has as much work and development on it. 
all other coins do not scale in a decentralized way.  if the average person can't run a FULL node, then it is not decentralized.  there is only bitcoin.
