 on Twitter needs a Saroshi symbol. It,s about one single Satoshi traveling the world via the Lightning Network and 1 sat invoices.  
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:07:36
We defenitely nees a symbol. Sat is the Unit of account - not bitcoin. But i am not a fan of this - preder the lightning s more

I watch it every few minutes / hours since a year.
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:49:01
they are. of course they are. everything else would be crazy.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:55:07
This is a joke right? So are BTC missing or just the USD valie that drops? Bitcoin is volatile, USD value changes by the minute.

If you ask yourself the question "should i sell?" - the answer is always yes. But just a part. Sell a small part,  keep the rest: Keep them on a ledger and dont make a photo of the seed / password ;) Keep at least 10 BTC. That is what I'd do.
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:07:42
Why ist this inevitable? 
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:47:10
Its Not. Its way better.

Any solutions apart from a Bubble Popping? since decentralisation ist The  reason for Bitcoin, Mining centralisation should be an important issue.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:59:49
I completely agree. Not watching the proce is a skill i havent developed yet. any recommendations?
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:00:30
Wouldn't some asic-resistance Like Monero, or Vitaliks plan to make ethereum being able to Run on a consumer Laptop be a step towards greater decentralisation?
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:56:24
Indont think we are at capitalation yet. I didnt loose hope so there could be more fear coming

Hi, thanks for the reply. 
I know how a 51% attack works but that is not what i mean. but it still would be double spending if for example the miner uses a spent output (instead of an utxo) Help me out pls.
If all non mining nodes do validate, and a malicious miner makes an invalid block by (for example) spending an already-spent-output,
but the rest of the block is good: the difficulty target is met, etc.or maybe he uses a UTXO of 1 btc to send 2 BTC to anotjer adress. (invalid transaction)
the only thing as i understand it being published on the blockchain is, that other nodes would reject it as an invalid block (because it doesnt meet the consensus rules, because he used a spent-output, therefore a fraudulent transaction).
But: What if the other validating full nodes are just programmed to validate this invalid block as valid? What prevents this? If can't be the software since basically everybody could code his own bitcoin client, not everyone uses bitcoin core.
I just really want to know this, hope it doesnt sound stupid. thanks for the help, you re a great community!
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:11:53
Can you explain more about that?
