If bitcoin ever got anywhere near 11$ a coin i would buy them so fast, im pretty sure alot of other people would too.
@_date: 2014-01-28 02:04:55
I've had this same issue with cryptsy, I put 3 mBTC into my account for the hell of it and found out that hard way that it was stuck there. I ended up trading for LTC to bypass the bullshit withdraw limit.
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:13:52
the deflationary aspect of bitcoin is what's giving BTC it's current price. since there are only 12.5 million coins in circulation they are alot more scarce then USD. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 18:45:51
BTC is a crypto currency ran by a network of miners. They're "mined" by groups of people combining their processing power to solve blocks. each block solved creates 25 new BTC which takes value from current BTC. Mining doesn't really inflate the currency since there is a ever changing difficulty number that determines how hard it is to solve blocks. since difficulty is so large now, 1.4 billion, you most likely wont be profitable by mining BTC. hope this helped.

No one is in denial. We're just more serious than any other crypto since we're the dominant coin. It's true that doge is gaining popularity faster then bitcoin but this is in no way a problem, in fact it's beneficial for the crypto community as a whole for ANY coin to gain popularity. besides doge's 90 million dollar market cap isn't even close to bitcoin's 8 billion dollar market cap

BTC's possible market cap or "ceiling" is really unimaginable, as of now it's roughly 10 billion dollars. facebook has a current market cap of 130 billion dollars. If BTC ever has as much money in it as facebook does now that would make BTCs 13X more valuable then they are today.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:57:28
you can purchase again if you want, the new purchase will have it's own transfer time. btw you shouldn't have to wait 30 days for your bitcoins to arrive from coinbase mine usually takes 4-5 days.
@_date: 2014-01-01 02:58:37
America definitely doesn't have a problem with BTC as the chairman of the federal reserve said BTC shows promise as a future currency. The banks on the other hand most likely have a problem with BTC since it threatens their whole industry.

I wonder what they plan on doing with the domain now
@_date: 2014-09-21 03:19:38
i really think BTC prices should ALL be universally changed to bits that way newcomers will think they're getting a great deal and experienced coiners will have more precise prices.

Everything was somewhat motivating until the clique keep calm and buy bitcoin.

just sent them 0.31 mBTC, hopefully they'll get an impressive total of donations 
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:33:31
1) For beginners coinbase is probably the best wallet
2) Look for bitcoin addresses in account settings
3) Preev is the most simple price converter, blockchain.info/markets is more in depth 
@_date: 2014-01-02 23:59:13
The site looks great! This is exactly what BTC needs, craigslist doesn't seem to cut it anymore.
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:39:59
stability will come from high market cap. once a crytocurrency has a large and stable market cap its price will be almost unaffected by day trading and pump/dump schemes.
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:59:54
sell if you cant handle it....
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:59:21
wouldn't that make the price 1 dollar?
@_date: 2014-09-21 03:27:45
its like trying to tell someone who's never been to the US what a grand is. people just dont understand the increments, so when the default increment is over 100$ its no wonder most people pass off bitcoin as being grossly over-priced without even taking a second glance.... i honestly think the only solution is making bits the universal increment.

Happy Birthday! Usually people get gifts instead of giving them on their B-day. This kind of generosity is what makes the BTC community so unique!

couldn't agree more but sadly I think some form of taxation and regulation will inevitably happen to BTC.

You're right it won't hurt 99% of Americans, but that other 1% is gonna really brace for impact.

sell it on an exchange directly, bitstamp is your best bet.

coinbase currently seems to be the most reliable and user friendly method of buying bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:00:13

the best way for someone new to buy bitcoin is probably through coinbase. they're fairly user friendly and their price isn't too bad either

Ok, Im not trying to act better then anyone btw. I'm actually a huge noob to the whole bitcoin concept and was just wondering a lot of questions about it. Do you also happen to know what someone can do with you wallet address? can people get scammed or hacked for money straight from there address or are they protected by wallet software?

@_date: 2013-12-08 11:31:18
Bitcoin may not have any morals but people do. lets get some BTC to the people that'll use it to better society. I ask every single person I know how much they know about BTC and if they CAN ACTUALLY understand it's only weakness is greed I give them parts of a coin.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:46:54
doesn't bitcoin.org have the copyrights to bitcoin so couldnt they therefore expand the whole project and create a hard currency or visa type card?

I'm sooooo willing to buy bitcoins at that price!!

I know, almost every person in this sub-reddit seem to. my problem is i think people don't believe in themselves enough to invest in BTC and it's really sad. the pure greed is hard to witness as well.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:50:23
yes but doesn't bitcoin.org have a certain amount of control over bitcoin itself or is that website just promoting the currency?
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:38:36
How is this not related to BTC's potential? BTC is economic freedom.

@_date: 2013-12-08 08:17:28
Exactly. do you believe BTC, or something similar, can be a world currency or do you think that's not possible in our lifetime? Yes I know it's already a world currency but do you think it could have the whole world's value at some point?
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:21:08
why not though, even if that makes bitcoins becomes centralized it would make them so much popular and therefore more valuable. Most people I talk to still don't have a clue what a bitcoin is really.
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:08:58

I know what trolling is you dumb shit. Do you know what a true investment is? Do you know how something of this magnitude becomes common knowledge? Its all about spreading the knowledge by whatever means possible, thats what makes the difference. not by sitting around and masterbating with you bitcoins like i would guess you do.....

As a freshman in college considering a business major, I feel the same way.
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:09:55
I know its not. I personally believe the only thing stopping BTC at this point is confidence thats why i wanna hear everyone's opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:06:40
Oh course, but with something as revolutionary as well as unstable as BTC the people on top must have good morals otherwise It effects everyone.
