I found this out while deployed last month in Afghanistan. My wife suggested it over Western Union. I don't need the western union commissions with my first baby due in 3 months!

Of course the Cyprus finance minister is watching bitcoin. It really would mess with Cyprus's nasty habit of stealing from its citizen bank accounts.

He's the same guy who cause the housing bubble. I think he know something about them.

On the bright side: They are being asked for damages to be paid in Africions. That works to about a tree fiddy.

I am not putting my whole life savings into bitcoin, but I do think that putting enough into bitcoin to make over seas transfers is relatively ok. Thank you and all the service men over there for you're hard work!

When I was in HS it was email that was the new thing that just the nerd kids were doing. And we all know how that bubble popped ;)

That is pretty clever. Good job.

Nice house and I love Alberta. Too bad I am not a bitcoin millionaire or she would have an interested buyer right here.

I was going to buy a Lamborghini last year ... but they didn't take bitcoin so I said no thanks.

I remember the first time I stopped at an airport restaurant with a tablet on each table for ordering. It was the best thing ever. This might be the next best thing ever.

This is a great article. PBS and NPR are the best source of no nonsense reporting.

The dad test - if your dad can figure it out you know it is going main stream. Happened for me back when email was the new fangled thing.

Remember the last time Greenspan was right about something? No? Me either.

Western Union is unbelievably expensive just because they know that many of the country to country transfers are in a "gray area" due to undocumented workers sending money back home. Indirectly the are capitalizing on human suffering.

Death panels where completely a republican fairy tale. Krugman is most definitely not republican.

I had thought 98,521.  Guess that's why I am not a wall street analyst.

I agree. The guy is sort of jerk here on r/bitcoin.
