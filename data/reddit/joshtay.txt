So this is the expansion period then?   I guess I would have to assume that there would be massive deflation in a currency that will never have more than 21,000,000 units in circulation.   
But the folks that are making a killing on it right now seem to less than faithful to the concept of a currency that is supposedly taking a more moral high ground than the evils of the Fed.  
Like I said, I know little about this and hope to understand more.   I think bitcoin is more than a flash in a pan.  Even if the whole thing collapsed tomorrow, it has awakened the population to think about money differently.

I understand it just fine, thanks.   
If I have a dollar, I can divide into 10 dimes.   But if the value of the dollar goes up, so does the value of the dimes.   
It is not about how many times you can slice the pie, it is about the price of the whole pie.  If I had 21 million pies to feed 21 million people, the pie would be one price.  If I had 21 million pies to feed all 7 billion people of earth, that pie would suddenly be more sought after and more expensive, regardless if you sliced it up into individual molecules.

But the actual Bitcoin unit will not exceed 21 mil.  So the value of each bitcoin will have to grow substantially.  
Obviously they would have to be subdivided.  But that was not what I was talking about.

A single bitcoin represents the pie.  
There are something like $1.18 trillion dollars in circulation.  
To replace that with 21 million bitcoins, each bitcoin would need to worth over $5,600.  Currently they are worth about $140.   And that is just what would be needed to replace US currency.  
Or course we would have to subdivide bitcoins, but that has nothing to do with the value of a single bitcoin growing.

I agree, although I am neither of the above.  As I mentioned to someone else, even if the whole bitcoin currency blipped out of existence, it has at least made us think more about the concept of money.  
My skepticism goes as far as since most of the population does not ponder the concept of money, bitcoin will confuse many and the majority  of people will distrust it for a long time.  It may take a generation or two before a digital currency really finds universal acceptance.  Credit cards were largely misunderstood and distrusted for a long time too. 
I am think that conventional currencies are not going to disappear anytime soon.   
I guess I am not skeptical about the concept as much as I am not sure how the adoption process will work.   I think even the staunchest supporters realize that there are lot of questions and obstacles out there.

If, as some are proposing, that this medium will replace currency as we know it,  and there will never be more than 21 million of them,  than each bitcoin will have to grow in value.

Thanks for the article. 
The zealotry here in this sub is a bit much.  I am getting downvoted for asking a question. I truly have no agenda, I just wanted to understand more.
