There is nothing special about it. If your mean web development then the majority of sites don't even use UTF-8 yet. Rakuten switched last year.
If you mean internet as infrastructure. The the infrastructure in Europe has better quality. They might be selling high speed, but that does not matter if the network has high packet loss because of congestion at peak hours.( when your home after work) or riding the subway home after work.

Basically what you described is the view foreigners who has never lived in Japan, have of Japan. That view is kind of obsolete and has been for the last 20 years.
Japan is in general behind in tech.

Don't worry it is just launched from the other side of the planet.

It been like this in Europe for the last 20 years. Please let the banks know they cannot survive. (They removed a lot of other fees too)

You should really read what has been written. You can start from where I wrote Japan would not be a better option than the US.

Average Joe would not benefit from switching to Blockchain. Some of the things that would happen then is that they would not be able to pay their bills very few companies accepts crypto, they would see their savings be diminished to nothing, just face it fiat is still king in everyday life. Nothing will change this fact for the coming 10 years. Blockchain is still gambling at the time of writing this, anyone saying something else is probably someone born around 2000 and have no adult responsibilities.

Yes, I think it's great.
Edit: between banks in Japan in not sure. It is a new thing in Japan(starting last year) with instant transfers. so they are still learning that they don't need people to do the work computers have been able to do for the last 20 years.

The multi days transfer is a US thing, (excluding cross border transfers, but this is not what average Joe does most of the time). Sweden and Japan checking in, here it Is instant.

My understanding is that most countries tax crypto as capital gains. Which in Japan is 20.xx% flat rate at the time of selling. It is also possible to deduct losses. crypto is taxed as income together other incomes from normal work, with no way to deduct losses.
Maybe this is how other countries do it too?

Wow it contunuea
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:49:34
Japan is a horrible option, up to 55% effective tax on crypto profit.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:37:41
I can't, butt I am willing to try for you.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:04:14
This is correct, so it is lumped together with your normal day job income for tax purposes. However you are allowed to make 200,000 yen a year under other income, tax free. So if that is all you take out in crypto and you have no other incomes, it is tax free. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:15:12
45% tax on over 40 million yen in income per year, year after 10% tax in municipal tax. Ends up being 55%.
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:30:50
Don't understand what that has to do with Japan?
