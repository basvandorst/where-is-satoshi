&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /&gt; 
Even though android states its not needed for internet. itis.
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" /&gt;
for device identity. Generates unique ID for each device to analyze  crashdata
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" /&gt;
to know if you are on a network
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" /&gt;
to know if your on wifi
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE" /&gt;
idk thats a google requirement
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS" /&gt;
another google requirement with their play services
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /&gt;
so i can prefetch ads to make a smoother experience
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" /&gt;
Ad providers required this. I turned off regional advertising in settings though. I still have to put it in the manifest
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" /&gt;
IDK why advertisers want to vibrate your phone but no personal info here
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" /&gt;
This is required by google for the 1% of phones that dont have play services.

Its not your actual ID. If you have an android, you have a specific id already on your phone. It does not contain your personal info. its a UUID. I have no clue even the email of the user who downloads my app. Go to the google settings app, click ads, thats all it gets. and you can randomize that or opt out of it, and my app just generates a random string of letters and numbers. 
Location is not used. Just required by AndroidManifest because it has ads. 
You did not listen. It has write to external storage. It does not and cannot access your personal files. That would be read  external storage.
It does not read your wifi info. It reads if you are connected to wifi. Does nothing about your actual wifi info.
I understand the paranoia, it went rampant when facebook released their messenger app. But android requires us to put very general permissions in apps even though we dont intend to use it.
