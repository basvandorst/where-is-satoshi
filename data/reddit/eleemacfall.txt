The value of fiat currency is set by *fiat*—an official declaration from a governing body that is legally enforceable. As such, fiat currency is "backed" by something after all: legalized force. Since nobody had the power to make such a declaration in the case of bitcoin, it never was and is not a fiat currency. Having nothing backing it doesn't make it "fiat"; otherwise, gold is fiat as well because nothing backs gold. In fact, the "nothing backing it" definition would call every market-based money "fiat", while only currencies created by legal fiats would be non-fiat currencies!

No, but most fat people don't eat at McDonalds at all, much less frequently. Most fat people eat a low-fat diet, because the government's food pyramid doesn't distinguish between healthy and unhealthy fats. And they compensate for the lack of satiation healthy fat would give them by snacking on carbs, which are produced by the government-subsidized grain industry. Which, not by coincidence, also raises the price of protein by increasing the scarcity of feed and pasture. And then there's the fact that subsidies have made it possible for the corn growers to put their shit in *everything*. Corn starch, corn sugar, and other processed corn byproducts dampen your metabolism and suppress the hormones that stop you being hungry when you eat. They cut flour with it. They sweeten everything with it. Oh, and that "USDA Grade A pure" honey you get at the store? Likely to be more than 50% HFCS. And how do they get away with it? Ask the USDA, they're the government agency that's supposed to be protecting us from that sort of eeeevil capitalism.
But this is really beside the point I made above, which is that free markets and government regulation are opposites. Either one is absolutely incapable of yielding the other. The statement that government regulation is the result of free markets is as absurd as saying healthy living results in poor health, or that peace leads to violence, or that the best way to prevent teen pregnancy is mandatory teen sex.

An attempt can be objectively determined and the would-be perpetrator treated as a threat (i.e., restrained). Reckless behavior is more subjective, though. Why is a drunk driver prosecuted, but not a driver who should have been in bed six hours ago? Why not his willing passengers? For that matter, why not lock up every mom who leaves knives within the reach of kids?
The reason is because we are still dealing with the prohibitionists. People who demonize alcohol, blame it for problems with other causes (such as their parenting, for instance) and would see it banned again if they could. It creates a double standard which, if it were consistently applied, would have us all behind bars.
Reckless drivers should lose their licenses, at most. Anything else is just persecution.

An "unconditional basic income" set above the marginal productivity of any person would ensure that that person never gets hired, at least not on the books. It would make it impossible for that person, and all those like him or her, ever to become independent of the welfare system without breaking the law and working under the table. And when, inevitably, the basic income is raised, the number if people legally forbidden to work will rise.
Which is absolutely no different from the problem presented by the minimum wage. Economically, it ignores the marginal productivity of labor and blows off the problem of paying people to do nothing. Morally, it is a total violation of the right of free association.

I don't disagree with anything you said, but I still think that gold and silver have a long way to go before people stop using them as money, simply because too many people like them for them to quickly lose their value as a medium of exchange. And because they are better moneys than fiat, we can expect them to outlast it.
I expect to see my Firefox add-on start reporting the current value of bitcoin in grains of gold before bitcoin actually becomes the standard measure of value in any major economy. Note, though - I'm not a goldbug, and I would not be disappointed to be proven wrong. I like gold and silver coins because they're pretty. That's about as far as my personal attachment to precious metal goes.

I'm a Christian because of how it has affected me, personally; not how it "makes the world better". Because it benefits me *spiritually*, nobody else can see that benefit firsthand. I hope they see it secondhand, as it changes me into a better person (by which I mean, the sort who follows the Beatitudes and the Golden Rule - not the judgmental, holier-than-thou sort who probably came to mind when I said that).
I use (and advocate for) bitcoin for the same reason - because of how it personally affects me. And some of that effect is spiritual, as well, as I view freedom, even in the political sense, in a spiritual light. But similarly, I hope that others will experience positive secondhand effects of the freedom and self-responsibility I gain from using bitcoin. As it already has done in a few cases which, unfortunately, I cannot discuss in detail - so you can either take my word for it, or not.

Bitcoin is a *currency* - not a  money. A currency can either be a direct medium of exchange, or indirectly represent a medium of exchange. A money is always a direct medium of exchange. At this time, bitcoin is an indirect medium of exchange. It represents fiat currencies, which in turn directly represent goods and services. This will change as more and more people begin to use cryptocurrency instead of fiat for direct purchases.
But in the meantime, I think that it is likely that we may see an intermediate stage of monetary evolution in which bitcoin is the currency used to represent gold or silver *instead of fiat*, with the metal still being used as the direct medium of exchange; preceding a time at which the industrial use-value of gold and silver is greater than its value as a currency, and cryptocurrency replaces metal altogether as money.

- Extremely low transaction costs, unless you're selling them for cash. Merchants don't have to pay out the nose to credit card companies and other middlemen, so that means lower prices for YOU.
- It's not inherently anonymous, but with proper precautions it can be made about as anonymous as anything can get with modern technology.
- On the other hand, it can be as transparent as it needs to be for an organization that needs to have its books open to the public. In other words, you get to decide whom to trust.
- You can have as many accounts as you want, each of them organized how you want. Try doing that with a bank.
- Not only is it not inflationary, it is *de*flationary. That means its value will appreciate. And unlike fiat paper or coin, you can just keep dividing it into smaller and smaller parts, which answers any objections about people not spending it because of its appreciating value.
- Like others have mentioned, it can never be used by a government to leverage an economy for any of the awful stuff governments usually get up to.

If bitcoin has comparative advantages to fiat for basic staples - which it does - then it  should, and probably will, be used for them.

Merchants could disburse the currency to those who want it.
Others - the ones receiving it - wouldn't keep it in their pockets. They would scan it, and if the bitcoins transferred they would accept it. If they didn't, they wouldn't accept it. You know, sort of like the anti-counterfeit measures that stores have now.

Escrow solves that problem for online transactions, but for face-to-face transactions: let's say someone reversed a transaction on you. Would you ever let them buy something from you again unless they made good? Would you not warn your friends and colleagues that that person is untrustworthy? Personal boycotts are a highly effective means of contract enforcement when people make it their own responsibility instead of farming it out to corporations and governments.
Nobody's going to risk that for a cup of coffee or a video game except for kleptomaniacs. They would only risk it for something very costly - but for something very costly, it is already normal to go through a lengthy process of vetting before the exchange takes place. With cash and credit, that process happens before money is exchanged; with bitcoin, it would happen after.

Well, there's a lot of overlap between your two categories for small farms. For instance, pickles. Pure end product - you open up the can, you eat the pickles. The raw ingredients are cucumbers and brine. A small, independent farm will grow their own cucumbers, make their own brine, make and can the pickles, and then sell them. The only ingredient that is distinctly in its own category in that case is salt, which one needs to make the brine.
I would consider a pickle farm that buys salt from elsewhere but makes everything else itself to be sufficiently independent from the mainstream economy so that if I gave them my bitcoin, I would know that they wouldn't just cash out to fiat to buy their ingredients.

"cheap, people that can't afford to carry phones around with them could use them"
This. The biggest problem with widespread bitcoin acceptance for laypersons on the go (until the possibly not-so-near development of bitcoin swipe cards) is wallet access. Smartphones are an obvious solution, but the remainder of the problem is solved with this idea. That includes everyone from those who don't have smartphones to those who don't have any internet or computer access at all.
Even a completely technophobic old person who literally can't understand the concept of digital money could use these.
Think about it: they can have a "bitcoin bank" (i.e., smart grandkid with a good printer) handle all their funds. They make a cash withdrawal, and carry BTC notes until they make a purchase. Merchants keep a bit of BTC paper on hand to use as "change". They take the paper-user's BTC, destroy the papers, hand them new paper as "change". As far as the paper-user knows or cares, it's just money changing hands like in 1950.
In a couple of generations the problem notes address would no longer exist, but in the gap between now and then, it's a good idea.

The fear of deflation is based on the chimeric notion that people hold money for its own sake, rather than for what they can buy for it.
If Paul Krugman (the most prolific modern evangelist of this fallacy) had a stash of a currency that were increasing steadily in value, he would gladly trade a few units of it on a regular basis in order to increase his standard of living. He would do that because even though he's dead wrong on a lot of things and a complete suck-up to the political class and its power structure, he's not a complete idiot. He's not going to starve, or refuse to fuel his car, or never buy a new house, or fix his old one, or invest, simply because of the existence of a greater future value. That would contradict the fact of time preference. Even Paul Krugman has a time preference, regardless of the fact that he has demonstrated either an inability or an unwillingness to understand the concept.
Also, in flat contradiction of the Keynesian model, savings tend to be invested rather than hoarded when money is deflationary. The investor plans on getting his money back, plus interest, thereby gaining a greater value than he would by sitting on his money; and in the meantime, the money circulates.
Finally, the fact that bitcoin is currently traded constantly and widely empirically disproves the idea that deflationary currency is unsuitable for trade. People keep balances against their plans for future purchases; not just so that they can have more spending power at their disposal.
The Keynesian theory of deflation would have it that everyone is a money fetishist, like Scrooge McDuck, sitting on a vault of money in which he can literally swim and spending nary a coin of it. The reality of human nature would beg to differ. People accept money so they can buy stuff. If they didn't want the stuff, they wouldn't take the money.

All money grows or decreases in supply according to the needs of the market, whether the total quantity in existence is fixed or not. The problem with a variable quantity is that there is literally no way for anyone to know when it should grow or shrink, or how much. Either it must be arbitrary, or it will be a "guess" that will only be correct for an instant, and then wrong. Guessing has predictably disastrous results; a fixed but arbitrary rate would be better, since the market would simply figure out and overcome the change in quantity as one of the many problems of economic calculation that only the market can solve. But it IS a problem of calculation.
There is no possible variation in the money supply that could better provide the market with the information it needs to properly adjust prices than could a fixed supply that changes in value as needed. At the very best it's a wash. And many of the supposed problems with a fixed supply are mitigated by bitcoin's divisibility. 
The most coherent objections to a fixed currency seem to be centered around the fear of deflation, but that's not saying much.

Everyone who has bitcoin is an early adopter at this point.
Of course they don't move the price by holding, but they do create value by *using* the currency as a store of value. Valuation and use create price, even if the use is basically autistic. Furthermore, hedgers are buying more, and that *does* push the price up. So in addition to direct exchange markets, there are also the values derived from bitcoin as a money transfer system, and bitcoin as a store of value. Put the three together and I think the fundamentals are more solid than a lot of people credit.

No, it really isn't. Fractional reserve banking is a means of subtly transferring purchasing power (and hence wealth) to politically-connected institutions, which is *enabled* by modern economies.
It requires that the average money-holder's future purchasing power be lessened in order to create greater present purchasing power for those who first receive newly issued money. An effect of that is the destruction of savings and the shift to debt financing: consuming now against the promise of future value. Deflation would result in financing from savings, which represent *actual capital stock* as opposed to the promise of future capital.

Take the "Un" out from the beginning and this is a correct statement.
The "intrinsic" (that is, the non-monetary) value of gold lies in its industrial and decorative applications. We have no idea what that value is, because almost all of gold's current value comes from its popularity among numismatists, hedgers, and those who actually use it for exchange. That is, gold as an industrial material has an unknown value for non-monetary uses. Gold as money has a particular value that is different from the former. And I'll venture to say that if it weren't for the demand for gold as money, its overall price would be abysmal; and in fact, the sooner that happens, the better, as it would lower the cost of using it in industry.
The "intrinsic" value of the dollar lies exclusively in the fact that if you don't have some of them with which to satisfy the demands of the world's largest armed faction, they'll do very unpleasant things to you. Otherwise it wouldn't even be worth as much as a similar volume of toilet paper.
The "intrinsic" value of Bitcoin has to do with the fact that a public, decentralized transaction ledger that is almost impossible to fraudulently alter is *pretty damn useful*. We have no idea what the precise value of that use is, because almost all of bitcoin's current value comes from its use as a store of value and a medium of exchange.
Bitcoin (capital "B") is to gold-as-industrial-material as bitcoin (lowercase "b") is to gold-as-money. As long as people find Bitcoin (or an analogous protocol) useful, they will demand, and hence impart value to, bitcoin (or an analogous cryptocurrency).
If bitcoin crashes to zero, it will be because a better way of doing cryptocurrency takes its place. Not because it is a poor choice for a medium of exchange, compared to gold or fiat paper.

It's not pedantry to correct someone who is unambiguously wrong and could do harm to an idea through his error.


These concerns depend on the assumption that there is no value to be gained by buying into a non-inflationary store of value to which governments do not have trivial access, which assumption is unambiguously wrong. Furthermore, after the demand for bitcoin as a savings vehicle has been largely fulfilled, there is the possibility that bitcoin could become a money, in which case it's value would be whatever you can buy with it. It is astonishingly wrong to say that those who purchase bitcoin do not gain use-value by doing so. It has a present use-value today, and a potentially much greater use-value in the future. When people "invest in bitcoin", they expect a return that, in total opposition to the Ponzi scheme accusation, is a very real possibility.

No, because of the Cantillon Effect. The politically privileged, which in most countries heavily overlaps with "the rich", receive new money first, and get to spend it before markets have a chance to adjust their prices upwards in response to the increased spending. Thus the poor get screwed twice by the same process: not only do they end up with less valuable money when it finally trickles down to them, but they also have to deal with a market burdened with unsustainable growth in the areas where the political class had been spending their newly-created money.

Yes, where "government" is a set of rules that are generally accepted and a means of enforcing said rules. By that definition, an insurer's TOS and code of conduct, a homeowner's association, a chamber of commerce, and the bylaws of a corporation, church or social club are all forms of government. And we do need those things.
But to say that "we need government" is not the same thing as saying we need a *state*—a group of people claiming the just power to use violence against anyone who acts on a disagreement with them. We need dispute resolution, but we should not have a single organization to resolve all disputes (including those to which it is itself a party). We need law, but we should not have a single organization with the power to define "crime" (which will generally exclude violence committed on its own behalf). We need defense, but we should not have a single organization whose agents are our only defenders.
The state's answer to the question "Who watches the watchmen?" is "We watch ourselves." But they mean they "watch out" for their own interests, so put that camera away or you will be arrested.


Giving a small group of people the power to decide not only that people must pay them, under the threat of ultimately lethal force, but how much they must pay, regardless of what they will get in return or whether they even wanted the service in the first place, is about as messed up as it gets.
How, exactly, do you think charity could possibly be "messed up" worse than that? Charity is a virtue. Threats of violence are not.


If you wanted an echo chamber you should not have spoken in a public forum.
Taxation is money taken, most often from peaceful people, under the threat of force. What is supposed to be done for those people with that money does not change the nature of what is done *to* them to obtain it.
There is not a single thing—be it infrastructure, law and justice, charity, whatever—that has not been done without taxation, even on a large scale, in the past few centuries. Unless we have regressed as a race (and I don't believe we have), then we should be *more capable* of doing that again, on an even larger scale.
If we cannot figure out a way to fund what we need without legalized violence then we do not deserve to be called a "civilization". It's really perverse that those of us who make suggestions as to how such a peaceful and voluntary society might function are supposed to be the barbarians here.


Why should I feel guilt for starving the beast that has openly *murdered* millions of people in the past century alone?
*Note: calling it "collateral damage" doesn't change the moral nature of the act.


I dare you to defend that statement. How are you a better person for knowingly giving money to a gang of liars, thieves, and murderers? It is no less of a rationalization to say "well, they also build bridges, schools, and hospitals" (by maintaining a legal stranglehold on the development and maintenance of infrastructure) as if that makes them worth supporting.
The mafia built bridges, schools, and hospitals, too.

In that unlikely scenario (usually people store up *goods* when they expect a crisis, which means spending), the value of the money would rise proportionally and people would accept a lower nominal rate of pay because *it can buy more*.
An entire economy could run on a single satoshi, and would, if it had to. The period of adjustment would be painful, yes—but unless (again) we are to commit the Nirvana fallacy, pain and hardship are going to happen; and the entire discipline of economics would be worthless if it did not realize that. Fortunately, we have the causal-realist approach. Unfortunately, it's not very popular. Most economic instruction comes via Schiller, an accountant *who doesn't even believe in economic laws*, which at least partially accounts for the fact that people keep throwing up objections to deflation that abstract from the way people actually act in order to conform to a politically convenient model.


Even if you are right in ignoring the adjustment of the market to the new quantity of money by assigning it a new price, the alternative is a money that would ensure malinvestment due to Cantillon Effects and then the loss of jobs when the economy inevitably liquidates that malinvestment.

It isn't. It's not even the best way. They won't listen to outcry. They will be amused at your anger. Nothing will make them change unless they, personally, stand to gain from it, or to avoid personal loss. But they won't lose anything from a public outcry. The public will still pay their taxes and fines, obey their stupid laws, and give obeisance to cops, judges, and legislators. The public is a herd of braying asses, and the government cares only about whether they go the way they are told to go. And whether by the carrot or the stick, they will.
Here's how you can effect change: just be free in you own life. Don't try to fight the government, because they will win. So just ignore the bastards, as much and for as long as possible. And if you're careful, that may be a long time, possibly for your whole life. But if and when it is no longer possible, still don't fight them. Peacefully, make a stand if you can, but don't think that being civilly disobedient will change the government. What it *might* change is a few minds and hearts in your favor, so that next time someone tries to ignore the state and the state won't leave them be, making a stand will be just a little but easier, and perhaps convince a few more people.

It's in the *New Libertarian Manifesto*. I'm paraphrasing, but in order for the countereconomy to be a true threat to the actual power of the state, the state must have already driven many "mainstream" people into it by severely debasing their own money. And with such debased money, the state would be unable to pay for the enforcement of their own laws. To put it very crudely, it would make cops, agents, and soldiers very easy to bribe. If the first thing a police officer does with his government paycheck is buy "black market money", who's he going to be arresting?

The beginning of the Great Depression, as with all sharply deflationary periods with established currencies, was a necessary correction to inflation, in particular to the 30% increase in money during the 20s that the anti-deflationists like to pretend never happened. It was the government's response that caused the depression. Had they let it run its course, it would have ended in a matter of months, like the depression of 1921, which anti-deflationists also conveniently ignore, and which was itself a correction to the Fed's initial inflationary period after its creation.

There are two ways to provide those things: speculation on the exchanges, or communication o demand by word of mouth.
The latter would be more "stable", but (actually, *because*) the price would rise so slowly it is doubtful that any of us would live to see bitcoin used for more than a tiny niche. As a recent meme puts it, "ain't nobody got time fo' dat!"
Speculation on the eventual long term price is the only way that anyone who is interested in seeing Bitcoin succeed could possibly live to see it succeed.

Great presentation! Kudos sir.
My only problem is with the "$1000 in four years" prediction. I understand that the price of bitcoin is all or nothing in the long run, and I lean towards "all". But I think it will take longer than that - probably at least a decade and a major inflation episode with one of the top few globally-used currencies.
Comparing the timescale to that of the Internet isn't quite fair. The Internet was truly revolutionary, and it spawned many things that still haven't worn out their welcome yet (like PayPal, though they're steadily blowing off their own toes IMO). Expecting people to accept Bitcoin when the Internet is still doing cool things with PayPal is like expecting people to buy the iPhone 7 a week after the iPhone 6 comes out.
The reason I said "10 years" is because by that time, today's kids will have grown up with all the stuff that is currently mainstream, seen its pros and cons, and be ready for something new. Sort of like how the Internet itself didn't really become ubiquitous until those who had grown up watching its birth were old enough to use it in their everyday lives.

Chargeback is a policy of credit card vendors and PayPal that allows the customer to charge the merchant back on the simple accusation that the merchant didn't fulfil his end of the deal (defective product, wrong product, wrong price, etc.) sometimes even *years* after the fact. Supposedly, it is for consumer protection, but in practice it allows unscrupulous customers to get stuff for free, since the process of challenging a chargeback is costly for the merchant.
In the case of PayPal for bitcoin, it often goes that the seller sends the bitcoin, the transaction is confirmed (and therefore irreversible), and then the buyer tells PayPal to chargeback the money they paid, which PayPal does because 1) it makes it easier for them to stay chummy with the establishment by mindlessly defaulting to the buyer's side due to consumer protection regs, and 2) Bitcoin's success is their loss, so of course they wouldn't facilitate it.
So the same feature of Bitcoin that makes it good for merchants to accept makes it difficult to sell with mainstream payment services.

The idea that "no one in their right mind would spend" under a steep deflation assumes that everyone is, in fact, out of their minds. It completely ignores the reality of human psychology, which includes the phenomenon of time preference; and time preference means that no amount of expected future value can completely outweigh all present need. Nobody is completely future-minded; all human values are fulfilled in the present. If I need shoes, there is no hypothetical value of bitcoin in the future that could convince me, in the present, in real life, to go barefoot in early spring. If I'm hungry, I'm not going to keep going hungry even if the cost of a cheeseburger today could buy me a private jet 10 years from now. Nor even should I wait until tomorrow, since I'll still have plenty of appreciating money left over. I can have my cheeseburger today, and *I'll still get my private jet 10 years from now*. The anti-deflationist argument is self-defeating. Deflation allows us to eat our cake and expect to have a bigger one later.

The value will not have changed, but value is not price. Yet value is somewhat determined by price, as the price lets one know how much other people have valued something in the past and are likely to value it in the future. If Gox went down today, the now four-year-long process of discovering what the long term price should be would be halted, or even reversed. People's values would change as a result of that lack of knowledge. The process would have to change gears, drastically and suddenly. People would sell blind, down to a much lower price than would be possible if they waited until they had information. And it could very well stay there until the new way of finding out the price was widely known. Which, realistically, may never happen.
The solution is simple: don't use a single source of information as if it were the only one. But most people don't even know they have alternatives, and that's what has to change. Gox's monopoly on price information is far more dangerous than its market share.

It does not neglect that. Rather it has already accounted for the fact that *people only hold money with the intent of spending it at some point*. The world is not full of Scrooge McDucks who keep their money in a vault so they can swim in it, or in the case of Bitcoin, on their hard drive so they can stare at their balance. In reality, savings are only deferred consumption; present need always overcomes potential future gain (look up the term "time preference"), so people will always spend money. Even now, as rapidly as bitcoin is appreciating, people are spending money.


Which is completely meaningless without reference to what money actually buys.


People need to have enough wealth that they can afford to employ others. Wealth is not "income" in an economic model.


There has never been a "money shortage" caused by a deflationary currency. Ever. There have, however, been money shortages caused by corrections to inflationary booms, in which the capital structure shrinks and people get laid off while markets figure out what went wrong. And every time in history (yes it has happened, many times) that the government didn't freak out and try to stop that process it has ended relatively quickly. But instead, they keep trying to reinflate the bubble that caused the problem in the first place, like a parent forcing a child who has swallowed something harmful to chug more Pepto to keep him from vomiting. The vomiting is nasty (and stepping outside of the metaphor for a moment, politically unpopular), but it is inevitable and necessary; and preventing it in the short run will only lead to a bigger mess in the long run. But hey, at least the Pepto will make it a nice, pretty pink color.


Promises are for people who believe in the [Nirvana fallacy]( In theory, all that bitcoin needs to do is provide a more solid basis for an economy than fiat has done, and that really isn't very hard to do. In reality, deflationary currencies have never provided examples of the downsides that anti-deflationists always cite.
The problem with bitcoin isn't that it's a deflationary currency. The problem is that *it isn't a currency yet*. As I've said elsewhere, it can become one after demand for bitcoin as a store of value or hedge has been met. And then we will have no more reason to fear that it will fail as a currency than any other deflationary currency—in fact, we will have less, because bitcoin's greatest asset is its resistance against the very kind of government/central bank manipulation that has destroyed currencies in the past.

As a protocol, Bitcoin has all the Platonic qualities of a money: scarcity, portability, fungibility, durability, usefulness. It does those things better than previous moneys: its scarcity is definite rather than approximate. It is instantly portable, anywhere in the world, almost instantly, with very low cost of transfer. It is perfectly fungible: you can't hide counterfeit bitcoin in with real bitcoin like you can with other moneys. It is extremely durable. Your bitcoins will always exist as long as the client network exists, which is likely to be as long as the Internet exists (though you may lose access to them by deleting your wallet without a backup, for example). And finally, Bitcoin (the protocol) is useful for other things, like creating unforgeable authentication for documents.
It also has useful traits that are not even considered under the Platonic definition of money: Its quantity will increase at a predictable rate. It is pseudonymous, which means one can be as private as one wishes to be. But at the same time, the ledger of transactions is public, permanent, and impossible to spoof - which means that one can also verify the fact of transfer, which eliminates one of the biggest costs of doing business. And finally, the protocol that manages bitcoin is open sourced and community-maintained, so that any technological (or for that matter, regulatory) challenges to the system can be quickly met while giving individuals plenty of options.
All of those traits result directly from the work that goes into mining. So the question of whether mining is "wasted computing power" shares the answer to the following question: Is a technology that establishes a monetary medium that is better than previous moneys a "waste of resources"?

False comparison. Bitcoin is to the Internet as Tradehill is to Pets.com, or (maybe) as BitMit is to eBay. Numerous applications of the Internet technology failed, but the Internet remains. Likewise, Bitcoin isn't going away even if many Bitcoin-based companies and ideas go bust. Its usefulness remains intact, and when enough people see that, it will achieve a price that will stick.

For that matter, Bitcoiners don't trust Ripple and governments for the same reason: central control of infrastructure is a critical weakness. Even if one assumes perfectly benificent motives, it is still susceptible to gross error; and with greater concentrations of infrastructure, even small errors can be catastrophic. 
Open sourced information and distributed control are the way to go. So here we have Ripple, pretending to solve the problem of government central control of credit by... being a private central controller of credit. That's not good; it's just less bad. Bitcoin has already solved the problem. We don't need Ripple, but hoo boy does Ripple need us!

No, you should not be free to violate the property right of another human being by polluting his or her property. 
Pollution is a tort and should be handled by a civil magistrate if the government handles it at all. And as a matter of fact it was for a long time. Anti-pollution judgments as property rights enforcements forced the coal industry to move from bituminous to somewhat more costly but far cleaner coal, for instance. Interestingly, it was the progressive socialists who put an end to that process when they influenced the courts to rule in favor of "national progress" through industrial expansion as against private property. When pollution eventually became a progressive issue, it was turned over to national governments for legislation rather than returned to the proven effective process of rights enforcement in the courts.
Personal freedom and property rights have done a far better job of handling the environment than governments ever have. Governments are generally the worst polluters around, followed closely by the corporations *which thrive on political privilege* passed down to them by governments. And this should not be surprising, since a government is essentially a corporation itself, one having a territorial monopoly on dispute resolution, *including cases to which it is itself a party* - which lack of liability (and conflict of interests, frankly) makes it rather foolish to entrust the care of the environment to it! They don't give a shit about you or the environment, except so far as it is necessary for them to take care so that a large group of people doesn't get angry enough to fight.

Deflation should be founded primarily on a high ratio of goods and services to units of currency rather than a dearth of extant currency in circulation. In the former case, "hoarding" is actually savings, which represent deferred consumption. In the latter, hoarding is a purely speculative behavior. 
Speculation is useful, but it should be proportionally *much* lower than exchange. Right now the ratio favors speculation over exchange, which means that each hoarder is statistically more likely to be a potential disruptor to the natural development of Bitcoin's value than he would otherwise be.
Of course, the only way to know for sure whether the hoarder is a saver or speculator is for them to release their bitcoin into the market. It's quite possible that the majority of hoarders are actually people like me, just waiting for a worthy buying opportunity. But as I said it's less likely to be the case than that they're just waiting for the next peak from which to sell off.

If I were you I wouldn't make it the only thing your store handles. Sell knick-knacks or used books or lemonade or something, and offer bitcoin services "in addition". The reason for that is that there are likely few people in your area who would be interested in coming to your place specifically for bitcoin, but if people come in for other stuff and you talk to them, you might be able to convert some of your sales to bitcoin transactions.

Loans and other investments, yes.


No. Prices aren't supposed to be stable. They are supposed to represent, as closely as possible, the unique and, more importantly, **dynamic**, needs and demand of billions of people. No single price, nor predictable rate of price change, can do that accurately. Any attempt to do so will be at best redundant, realistically counterproductive, and sometimes disastrous.
"The economy" is the interactions of the whole human race. You can't force billions of other people to be neat and predictable, so the sooner people realize that the economy is going to be messy and chaotic and there's *nothing* we, nor any government or technological system we can design can do about it, the better. Stop trying to control the wind. Weigh anchor, and unfurl the sails.


I can't afford a 20BTC haircut. I certainly can afford one that costs .002BTC, though.


Only if by "people" you mean a completely unrealistic model of *homo œconomicus*. In reality people have time preference. They satisfy their most urgent current needs before they direct resources to the satisfaction of less urgent ones, and all potential future gains fall into the latter category. By the assumptions of the [apoplithorismosphobiacs]( (PDF warning for that link), we'd all wait until we were on our deathbeds to buy a laptop because we know that there will be a better one available at the same price in three months.
But of course, that's absurd. Nobody is going to go hungry while he waits for the price of food to fall by another unit of currency—if anything he will be okay with paying what he knows will be a relatively higher price today because he knows that tomorrow, buying will be even less painful—so he will still be able to be fed.
This is borne out by the fact that people do buy things with bitcoins now, even though they know that at current rates they may be worth twice as much in another couple of years. And as more goods and services become available, making the ability to satisfy present needs more real for bitcoin users, that will become even more common.


I've yet to be convinced that such a thing as a "deflationary spiral" has ever actually happened or could happen.
If human productivity continues to increase, goods will one day be so abundant that prices will be infinitesimal. At that time I predict those who fear deflation will be faced with the unenviable task of convincing everyone else, as they enjoy unprecedented abundance, that they actually starving, naked, homeless, and unfulfilled.

Like gold has, right? At any time in the past five thousand years?
It does have something backing it: demand for a mobile store of value to which governments do not have trivial access. Which demand is really quite high, and its only a matter of time before enough people who demand it find bitcoin and spread the market out enough to tighten the margin of speculation. Then we can test the idea that money doesn't work without the threat of legal violence forcing it to work. Although, that idea has been historically and praxeologically disproven already, so I doubt Bitcoin's success will convince those who think the world only turns if a politician pushes it.

Once again, the fact that the government provides something (more accurately, monopolizes the provision of something) does not demonstrate that the government is needed to provide it. The history of private charity before the welfare state in America demonstrates the opposite, in fact.


This is sheer bigotry.
I work for a food bank with a growing clientele who are not adequately served by public welfare. We operate on a 15-20% overhead. The public services in our area have over an *80% overhead*, and we're still picking up their slack. I'd ***LOVE*** to donate money as well as time. But instead I'm forced to give money to a government that is far more concerned about maintaining the lifestyles of middle-class bureaucrats than it is about helping people. It pisses me off to no end that I don't have enough money to be generous.
But I suppose it's much more convenient to your argument to believe either that
* I'm lying, and would really spend my currently taxed income on the latest iGadget.
* I'm special, and nobody else but me would like to be generous.
More to the point, let's not make this about me. Would *you* be more generous if you had more money? If so, then you have no reason to presume that most other people would not be likewise inclined. And if not, then please stop projecting your shortcomings onto the rest of the world.
Working for the government doesn't make people charitable. All it means is that one is willing to use legalized violence to accomplish his goals, which is quite the opposite of charity.

They already fail to catch tens of millions of non-taxpayers who purportedly owe. Bitcoin will not only make evasion logistically easier, it will also take away the state's control of money itself, without which they will not have the financial means to enforce their tax laws. Sorry* to disappoint those who fear a world in which their neghbors are not controlled by governments, but we're going to be seeing radical decentralization of control through things like Bitcoin, and taxation will be one of the first casualties. We're going to have to start acting like grown-ups and find a way to pay for what we need without forcing our neighbors to contribute.

What you call "hording" (sic) is monetary value representing real capital stock, from which all solid investments, including those in new technologies, are drawn.

As I said, historically, that has not been the case. Majoritarianism is distinguished from democracy in classical liberal theory for a reason, and that reason is that they are not the same thing. Though of course they can overlap (and have, especially after the emergence of social democracy). The point is, a person *can* use the word "democratic" and mean something very much along the lines of what "libertarian" means in the US. If that's what they mean, then there's no need to get all pedantic and correct them.

The Bitcoin network ran as an *experiment* before anyone knew a bitcoin would ever be worth a damn thing. You can read the conversations in the early days of the experiment - the first offer of money was made off the cuff "for the sake of the experiment", long after the network was already running and bitcoin was being sent around for free, as digital trinkets in which only a crypto-enthusiast would see value.
Furthermore, when it began to gain in value, many of the experimenters, inducing Satoshi himself, expressed worry that it was not technologically ready for mainstream exposure. Hardly the attitude of someone trying to gain a financial advantage. 
Now I'm not saying Satoshi didn't benefit greatly from mining early. But shouldn't he have? He made the thing, and mining was necessary to test it out. But from the substantial evidence provided by the discussion during the experiment stage, there is no standing for an accusation against his motives. It was more important that Bitcoin worked than that his bitcoins appreciated. And I sympathize. I would rather see bitcoin go mainstream and accomplish Satoshi's goals for it even if it meant I stayed relatively poor. But I'm not going to complain about the fact that in reality the success of bitcoin will also make me less poor, or possibly even rich.
@_date: 2013-05-21 13:35:48

In the same way that technologies that make labor more efficient "free up" labor and enable it to move on to other things (even though it may result in short-term unemployment, especially in a hampered market), a technology that acts as a better medium of exchange than gold will "free up" gold for use in other applications. It would be GOOD for commercial chemistry, medicine, food and drink, industry, electronics, and chemistry if those needs weren't competing for gold with those who use it as a money/hedge. The only industry that would lose out would be jewelry, which depends on things being valued over their more practical uses.

The current economic system is what is not desirable.
People would still spend; they just would spend more carefully. Anti-deflationists theorize, but history does not bear out their theories. Deflation does not lead to a liquidity trap and stagnation.

No, but the fact that the market survives such an attempt would. Note that more growth has happened since the last big spike. I wouldn't go so far as to say that the fact that Bitcoin survived the spike was responsible for much of that growth, but I know there are some who were convinced of its resilience and decided to get some.
Some people, at least (and far more than currently use Bitcoin) know that the government's own money is going to ultimately become worthless, so as it begins to lose value faster a currency that survives intentional attempts to destroy it will gain appeal, even if it is *temporarily* unstable because of that manipulation.
If the government wanted to destroy bitcoin by that means, they'd have to do it now, while it is relatively unknown. If they wait until they're really in trouble, then it will be too late. And as I've said elsewhere, I don't think they're smart enough to do anything about it while it would do them any good. They won't pay any attention to bitcoin until it is actually a significant threat.

I am, and it's completely irrelevant, but I'll bite.
The overwhelming majority of "crime" is created by a legislator's pen, and doesn't actually constitute a harmful act by one person against another. Most violent crime is associated with prohibitions of nonviolent behaviors: for an obvious example, drug dealers shoot each other because they have a territorial business model *directly created by prohibition*. Likewise, drug users respond to the enormously high black market prices by committing acts of robbery. Prostitutes get raped and beat up. Small (and not so small)-time gangsters provide gambling infrastructure. And on and on.
And that is only one side. Another is economic: the cost of following so many laws, and of paying for their enforcement, is no trifle. And that's inevitable. So much revenue comes from fines for small violations that more and more small violations will predictably be laid on the people over time. More laws need more enforcement, and enforcers have salaries. Salaries require revenue. It is a vicious circle, ever growing, and the poor are, of course, hurt by it the most. And for only one reason: they're easy targets.
You want to make this about race and economics? Fine. I'm thinking about how the drug war has *completely* destroyed the urban black family. I'm thinking about how lower middle-class people who can't afford all the mandatory "beautification" crap in good neighborhoods end up stuck in neighborhoods that are just so shitty nobody cares to enforce the "beautification" laws. I'm thinking about a local immigrant couple, friends of mine, who have had to close three small businesses because they couldn't afford to meet the *legal requirements* to keep them open. And all the other immigrants whose labor services would be embraced by the market but for immigration laws.
The fact is that regardless of their stated purpose or the intentions of those who create them, states are always vast instruments of organized force. Force is not how civilized people deal with each other. It is not how compassionate people care for each other. Force is how bullies make victims. The political class are predators, and like all predators, they prey on the weak and vulnerable. The rich, at least those who do not collude with them, will find them annoying. They will be thwarted and frustrated. But the poor suffer the most under the state. Those who are not consumed are made into dependents; but they should not be fooled into being comfortable in their dependency. The state feeds only those whom it intends to eat later.

Money is a medium of exchange. ANY medium of exchange. USD is money in most of the world. Rials are money in Iran, but not in the US. Cigarettes are money in prisons, but not in many other places. Polished river rocks and shells are money in a few small tribal societies, but nowhere else. Bitcoin is money to a growing number of people on the internet. Saying that bitcoin shouldn't be called money is like saying email shouldn't have been called communication because it redefined the way communication worked. We don't need a new term with which to confuse the world. We need to offer them a better version of what they already know.
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:56:16
That is all true, and also *completely irrelevant*.
Once again you completely fail to recognize the difference between economic value and other forms of value. You might as well say that things have inherent economic value because they have quantity, and quantity is a value. If you're going to talk about economics then use economic concepts. Trying to smuggle physical energy into a conversation about economics is a perfect example of comparing apples to oranges. So far, you're the only one who is talking about physics here. The rest of us aren't. Get on the same page, or your comments will continue to be irrelevant to the conversation.
Even physical energy itself has no inherent economic value. If a person had nothing but loathing for all of existence, then energy is not doing him any good. We are free to ignore him and his valuation of energy, but in economic terms, his valuation is completely valid and proves that economic value has nothing to do with physics.

And yet people spend it. And I assure you, the more you look at individual motivations and the less you try to make people fit an abstract model, the more it makes total sense that they should. The incentives to spend are still there, though they are limited by the steep curve of appreciation. The difference between now and the point at which the rate of appreciation levels out and any point after that is quantitative, not qualitative.

The great thing about society is that it can organize itself, as Bitcoin demonstrates. Markets are inherently organic. They don't need organizers. But those who see themselves as organizers do need us. Apparently OpenCoin wants to organize society. I recommend that society ignores the shit out of them, and along with them, Ripple.

Every money must have a prior use-value before it becomes a money, and bitcoin is no exception. As others have noted, the currently most common use is as a store of value, and here's the catch: *we have no idea what the long term price for bitcoin as a store of value should be*. I predict from reason, not blind enthusiasm, that it must be much higher than it is now. Once that price has been discovered, the margin of speculation will tighten substantially and we may see it begin to become a money, but not before then. And if it never is discovered, then Bitcoin must fail as a store of value as well, and fade into obscurity. But I think the former is more likely.

Some, yes, but others would refuse to deal with credit issued against value that doesn't actually exist, which is what fractional reserve amounts to on the macro scale. Those banks that loan more than they have would be driven to insolvency in the long run. That doesn't mean fractional reserve would be eliminated, but it would have to be kept tight.
In most cases, for anyone who isn't a bank, representing yourself as having money you don't actually have is fraud. I think that unless banks were very, *very* careful, fractional reserve might come to be regarded as fraudulent in a society with more choice in banking than we have now.

I think you do not actually understand what Bitcoin is. Until Bitcoin there was no such thing as a public accounting ledger that was both (1) almost impossible to fraudulently alter, and (2) free of counter-party risk. If you know about one, then I'd like to know why you're the only one. And if you don't know why that development is revolutionary... well, that's fine. You don't have to know. But as long as you don't know, remember that it's never wise to talk about something about which one is ignorant.

Not yet as far as I'm aware. But you can run "lite" clients that do not require you to store or scan the blockchain yourself, such as Electrum and MultiBit. You'll pay for security in convenience and vice versa. The easiest wallet to use is an online one; locally-stored wallets such as the ones I mentioned above are better but not the best. The most secure way is to download Qt and Armory, wait for the blockchain to load, make a paper wallet without an electronic copy. Obviously getting BTC out of that will be rather a bitch, so you might use that for long-term savings and keep your cash on hand in a more convenient arrangement.

First, Somalia was only stateless for a brief period of time, during which it had the fastest economic growth of any African nation which was caused by the relative security of property rights. After that it suffered from an excess, not a lack, of states: UN-supported warlords fighting the tribal structures that had begun to re-emerge, the Islamic Courts Union, and others all vying for control.
I'd like to see your source for violence in Dark Ages Europe. It tends to be sensationalized quite a bit. But either way, Europe was not free of states either. The Holy Roman Empire was a state in its own right, and it occupied most of Europe during that time.
I was referring to the following:
* Iceland under the goðorð system, which lasted for over 300 years and in which the closest thing they had to a state was the Althing, whose sole power was in deciding how many different goðorð (competing legal systems) could exist. The fact that they could limit the number of goðorð is what eventually led to the downfall of the system, as it caused a consolidation of power among the goðorð and thereby permitted the Holy Roman Empire to bribe and threaten those few remaining by the time they invaded. Had the Althing not imposed such a limit, the power structures might have been too decentralized for the invaders to co-opt and conquer. Violence was much lower there than in other Viking societies that had kings and even elected leaders, and despite Hollywood sensationalism, the Vikings were no more violent in reality than any other culture at that time. (For more on this, Roderick Long has several pieces on his website at [praxeology.net](
* The tuatha system of Ireland, which lasted over a thousand years, including the 500-year-long time during which England periodically attempted to take it over but was completely unable to because of the lack of a political center to take down. It didn't end until Cromwell's brutal conquest in the mid-1600s. As small and resource-poor as Ireland is, they managed to hold off the English for over *500 years* without a state. During its stateless period, Ireland was one of the wealthiest, most literate, and most peaceful societies in the world. Not perfect, of course—though stateless, it was not libertarian, and the Brehon Laws permitted chattel slavery of non-Irish persons. However, the slavery permitted there was neither as ubiquitous nor as licentious as that later practiced under post-Enlightenment states.
* Most recently, the American frontier, especially the West, which was not nearly as "wild" as it appears in the movies. As shown by Anderson and Hill in their book *The Not So Wild, Wild West: Property Rights on the Frontier*, even the worst crime rates on the frontier were far less than even moderate crime rates today in cities of similar population density. And they tended to be worse where the government had the most influence, as in Dodge and Kansas City, because of the centralization of power that enabled corruption to persist, whereas elsewhere competition kept it out. Competitive justice permitted horizontal appeal, and custom with an eye towards peace, rather than legislation, tended to decide cases. Because the Sheriff was under a private contract to keep the peace, he could not act above the law in a way that would disturb the peace. There was no special immunity for him. Contrast that to the politically-appointed Earp brothers, who used their political power to disarm the populace of Dodge City and ensure that the only people with guns were the gangs who ran the place—most importantly, their own gang of so-called "lawmen".

Yes, but that doesn't mean it's without sustainable value. People who are aware of the costs of inflation or fear bank account seizures and other shennanigans by governments have a high incentive to buy and hold. Once demand for bitcoin as a store of value has equilibrated somewhat, its rate of appreciation will slow down and then it will begin to be used as a currency more often.
 &gt;Why would anyone want to use bitcoins to transact business when they won't be able to be sure of the "true" value for several years.
Discounts offered by merchants who recognize the long-term benefits of bitcoin holdings will drive the exchange economy until the relative equilibrium I mentioned above is achieved. In theory, there could be enough of that for a thriving economy to exist even during a steep appreciation, but my expectations are far more modest.

My addition to what has already been suggested:
"Bitcoin" is the protocol, community, or idea.

"BTC" is used to denote a quantity of bitcoin. It is not consistent with the language of money to use it as shorthand for "bitcoin".
"BTC's" has two problems: first, you don't need to pluralize a quantity term (8 oz., 4 dozen; not 8 oz.s or 4 dozens); second, the apostrophe. Oh god... the apostrophe!

Actually, that's a completely different question from the moral one that I was answering.
But in terms of consequentialism (which is what you seem to think this is all about), the issue is not government in the abstract. It is about the current form of government, the state. On that issue:
(1) Stateless societies have existed in the not-distant past and tended to have far lower rates of violence than modern state societies.
(2) Considering that the state does not change human nature for the better and in fact gives a certain group of people with a predilection towards violence the *legal right* to murder, we have no reason to expect that the absence of a state would result in more murder.
(3) Even if it resulted in a similar rate of murder rather than a markedly lower one, the existence of the state could not be defended from a consequentialist position on that basis; and it would still be vulnerable to moral objections against making certain people immune to legal prosecution when they commit murder in certain circumstances.
(4) A state will, at best, only reflect the prevailing values of its host society. A society that believes in defaulting to violence to solve its problems will produce a very violent state, which would only shield the *cleverest* violent members of that society from the legal consequences of violence. Conversely, a society that believes in peaceful resolutions to disputes and values individual rights over political goals could not possibly be made better by a state, which is the application of violent means, and so whose existence would contradict that society's peaceful ends.
Therefore anarchist libertarians consider the absence of a state to be a necessary condition for a free and peaceful society. But that does not mean that we consider it a *sufficient* condition.

The ultimate solution is to use bitcoin to buy stuff directly and not worry about conversion at all. So this does sound like a good halfway point. The problem, though, is exactly the same as that facing direct exchange: a lack of double coincidence of want. I have no need for VOIP minutes because I neither use nor know anyone who uses VOIP (if I find someone who does I'll send them your way, though). So I think that rather than being a way to convert BTC to fiat and *vice versa*, a network of businesses such as the one you describe could be an avenue towards direct exchange. But it would have to be a pretty big network.

If humans are so lacking in goodwill then the absolute worst thing we can do is give some of them power over others. And the most centralized, violent concentration of unequal power is the state.


Speak for yourself. I'm the most happy when I'm helping other people, and I'm hardly special. What I want is for people to separate the act of loving our neighbors from the reliance on political force.


Then explain the history of voluntary large-scale charity prior to the welfare state. Or didn't you know there was one?
Also, your criticism applies just as much to politicians as to everyone else. In fact it applies more strongly, because politicians include those who actively seek power over others. Which would be one reason why something like 80% of welfare money goes to the middle-class bureaucrats who run the system, whereas the efficiency of private charity is almost the inverse. (The other reason is the inability of non-market organizations to perform economic calculation.)


The fact that we rant on the Internet does not mean we do not do meaningful work elsewhere, not that education and persuasion are not meaningful in their own way. But if you're going to make such uncharitable assumptions as you have, then you should not be surprised when you get ranted at.


No; fuck the system. I'm not giving one more cent or Satoshi than I have to to the system that enriches the political class at the expense of the poor, murders millions in the name of "defense", and tells us we should be grateful for the services they monopolize by the force of law. Nor will I be a part of it. 
There are plenty of ways to work for change without kissing Caesar's ring and filling his war chest. They are the only ways that interest me. And Bitcoin makes more of them available than have ever existed before, to those who don't feel like they need to ask permission from the state before they act.

I'm buying it for both. If a Bitcoin merchant can offer me a better deal than I would get with fiat, I'll take it, and then have more fiat left with which to buy things that I need and can't get with Bitcoin. But I'm also keeping some back to ride the lift as high as it will go. Deflation does carry a disincentive to spend that can't be ignored. But I don't think it's even controversial (except among diehard Keynesians) that you don't need everyone to spend everything they get in order to have a functioning economy. Prices adjust to a low velocity of money, and then when the value of money stops rising, people spend more of their savings. In the worst case, they spend it all quickly, and you have a boom that will have to be corrected. Which will only happen once, and would not be hard to recover from if the economy is fundamentally sound (i.e., basically free). More likely they spend it a little at a time and the economy has no trouble adjusting.
It's not like there aren't problems with deflation, but they're small potatoes compared to what inflation inflicts on an economy, and the benefits easily outweigh the problems. Whereas there aren't actually any benefits to inflation, except to the people who get to print the money, and those to whom they hand it out first.

It is this very naïveté that allows the Fed to work the way it does. The process doesn't take money out if your pocket - that would be too noticeable. What it does do is create present spending power in favor of the first recipients of newly-created (or circulated) money ("Joe") at the expense of your (or "Suzie's") future purchasing power. If you're not clear how that works, read about the Cantillon Efect. It doesn't just hurts speculators. It hurts *everyone* downstream from Joe. If done subtly it can serve as a constant transfer of wealth to the money issuers and their favored interests from everyone else.

What we need is a community with the rather modest amount of patience required to help newbies use the resources already available. Obviously I don't mean everyone, but some people around here seem to think they're above helping the curious and uninformed. Yeah, sure—you can call it "lazy" when they don't know about BitInstant, or if they do, don't know how to use it, and ask someone to show them instead of figuring it out themselves.
I'll see your "lazy" and raise you one "screw you, all I have to do to use Visa is give my card to the clerk."
The higher the threshold of difficulty for obtaining bitcoin is, the more people will have absolutely no interest in using or even learning about them. It is in the interest of everyone who holds, uses, or plans to hold or use bitcoin to keep that threshold as low as possible. And since for most of us all, all that takes is pointing newbies in the direction of the most common resources with some helpful suggestions, I would argue that it is not the newbies who are being "lazy" in this case so much as that some of those who are the most capable of helping them are too impatient or stuck up to try.

Your economic understanding is about 200 years behind. This is the same fallacy that confused Adam Smith, but was addressed by those who came soon after him. Smith wondered how people could possibly value diamonds over bread, since diamonds satisfied only aesthetic desires, whereas bread is, in his words, "the staff of life". His problem—and yours—is the attempt to put economic value on a whole abstract category of goods. Of course if one were forced to choose between forever giving up bread or forever giving up diamonds, he would choose diamonds. But in reality, few people are faced with such a choice. Peoples' choices deal only with a finite number of units of a particular good at a particular time.
The most important thing is that economics is always and only about the pursuit of ends with given means. Once an end has been fulfilled and the good therein sought consumed, that good no longer has economic value. Only that which is being sought has economic value.
Imagine a man stranded in the middle of a desert, dying of thirst. To the east is the location of a buried chest of gold. To the west is an oasis. He knows that if he goes to the gold, he will die of thirst before he makes it back to the oasis. So, even though he may regret being unable to get some of the gold, he will almost certainly choose the oasis.
In this case we see that "gold" is not, in fact, more valuable than "water", even though in normal circumstances you get a higher price for even a grain of gold than for a quart of potable water. Where water is scarce and needed, its value relative to diamonds increases. But after the man drinks and fills his canteen at the oasis, he will not value the obtainment of more water, and so he can walk to the treasure and take it.
Take the same man, some days later, when the bandits who buried the gold have taken him captive and are holding his head under water to torture him into revealing where he hid what he took. Too bad for him—he already spent the gold. Now, water has no value to him at all. In fact he would like nothing more than to have nothing to do with water. He wishes for nothing more than to have back the gold he spent so that the bandits will leave him alone. So in this case we see that "water" is not, in fact, more valuable than "gold".
After he effects his escape, he is in yet another condition where, having stolen the bandits' camel herd, he has all the gold and water he can carry. Neither more gold nor water than he already has will be of any use to him, and would not turn aside either to find more treasure, or to an oasis. Furthermore, his circumstances have changed to where water does not impose a *negative* value on him.
The key here is in the Law of Marginal Utility, which states that each additional unit of a good will provide less of a gain in utility than the previous did. This means that the actual units of a good that a person deals with are heterogeneous in terms of value, and therefore in economic terms, *different goods*. The food that is inside of my body is a different good than food that is not inside my body. After eating, neither has any economic value to me. If I take another unit of the good "food-inside-my-body", then I will become uncomfortable, which has a *negative value*. And if you were to wave a plate of "food-outside-my-body" in front of my face, I would have no interest in it. The good "food-in-the-future" is another good, one that I will at some point seek, but it is *not* the same good as any present good. The most important difference is that a future good *only exists hypothetically*, whereas present goods exist in reality.
Your "inherent value" of food attempts to include all possible units of food in the same category, both sought and obtained, present and future, hunger-satisfying and vomit-inducing. While in fact, those goods are all separate and therefore must be, and in fact *will be*, valued differently.
So, no; food does not have inherent value. Even if you cut it down to the atomic level you will not find a single bit of value in it unless some human being comes along and values it. And that person will value it differently from you. He will have different tastes from you, or a different level of hunger. And there is absolutely no way to make interpersonal measures of value.

That doesn't even make sense. Was Ghandi a part of the Raj? Was MLK2 a part of racial injustice? Not comparing myself to them, but if it's not true for them then it's not true for anyone else who stands up to a system with which they disagree.


The question isn't whether you're fed up. The question is whether you are willing to do something about it, and if so, whether what you do will be meaningful. Continuing to feed the beast that wants to eat you is not meaningful.


That's not logical.
The mafia built infrastructure during its heyday. If someone used that infrastructure and did not pay the "protection money", was that person reneging on some obligation to the mafia? How was that obligation created? He did not ask the mafia to build the infrastructure. He would have preferred that someone else do it, but he was denied that choice.
If you say yes, he was obligated, then logically, any evil person or gang of people can justify their existence by doing some good things on the side. Mr. Jones of Jones Lawn Care robbed Mr. Smith, used most of the money to buy a gun and killed Mr. Smith's neighbor, but Mr. Smith is now supposed to be grateful because Mr. Jones donated a whopping 30% of the money he stole to a homeless shelter. Oh, and he's giving Mr. Smith "free" lawn service.
If you would answer no, the resident of the mafia town is not obligated to pay the mafia, then logically, neither am I obligated to pay the government, who has killed more people in the past 150 years than all the organized crime combined.
We need some of the things that government provides. No one is disputing that. Without those things, we would starve. But we are deprived of the choice to pay an organization that does NOT commit large-scale murder for those things, by the legal stranglehold the government maintains on infrastructure.
So our options are:
* (1) Use them and pay
* (2) Use them and don't pay
* (3) Don't use them and starve to death
* (4) Move somewhere else
I cannot willingly support a gang of liars, thieves and killers, so I will not use option (1).
I will not become a victim of said gang through deprivation, so I will not use option (3).
I will not abandon my home and my loved ones and run away, so I will not use option (4).
That leaves option (2): don't pay, use the services they monopolize as much as I must, and work to create alternatives to the government's provision of those services.

Possible, but not likely enough to warrant the flippant assumption you just made.


Constitutions don't limit governments. The only thing that limits governments is the ability of people to withdraw their consent in a meaningful way. For that to happen, the government has to be designed to have no powers of legislation and confiscation, capable only of acting as a third party judge and enforcer *for those who seek its services*, and nothing else. Nor could it be the *only* judge, because an organization that has the power to judge its own cases is unlimited in power, even if theoretically limited in scope. But to have the government subject to the same judicial processes as everyone else (rather than everyone subject to the government's judicial processes, including the government) would constitute an anarchic condition.
If you will not work for the dissolution of political power you will end up with an omnipotent state. Power disparities cannot be checked, by definition, because only an equal power could possibly accomplish it. They can only be eliminated, or allowed to grow. There is no middle ground.
Personally, my "constitution" is the Golden Rule, which contains the libertarian non-aggression principle. That's the only constitution I need, it is the only one I respect, and it is the only one I will follow. I won't be forcing you to follow my laws as long as you don't attack me. Can I expect the same courtesy from you with your constitution? I doubt it. Those who favor political power are never content to leave their neighbors alone in peace.

I work in trades, but even there you get pressure from the administration to say certain things and not to say others. The administration gets their orders from the State, who gets theirs from the Feds. And it is sheer naïveté to think that the government will allow any information that even *hints* that they might be up to no good, or that we might not need them, to be taught with the authority of an accredited teacher.

No, of course not. People are *rationally* ignorant, meaning they can't know everything, so they have to prioritize. And those who have much to gain from a docile and obedient populace, which includes anyone with power at stake, will take advantage of that fact. 


People don't like *foreign* tyrants, but as Étienne de La Boétie described in *A Discourse on Voluntary Servitude*, they have little problem with a tyrant raised up from their own nation, because they seldom recognize him as one. And the tyrants' cleverest trick of all was to convince the people that they could *be* the government. Because of course, if the people are the government, how could there be tyranny?
But there is. As Lenin recognized, all government is really about "who gets to do what to whom". Democracy is about deciding which large group is the "who", and which is the "whom". Once you get a democratic plurality (a true majority is really quite impossible on a large scale), you have a group of people saying to everyone else, "do what we say or we will hurt you"; which is morally indistinguishable from the tyrant saying "do what I say or *I* will hurt you". In fact the tyrant also has a "we"; if he did not, he would have no power. So the difference is really only in the size of the group that is the "who" and the size that is the "whom". Both the tyrant and the democratically elected state will kill you, eventually, if you disagree with them and act on your disagreement.

They won't. Currently, nobody's dumping their dollars (on a large scale) for bitcoin, Amazon Coins, or euros. But they would act against any of those three if people did start to do that.
People fear for Bitcoin because it has a much greater *potential* use-value as money than Amazon Coins (or, many would say, any fiat currency). But right now, it is nowhere near its potential; and I think we should be glad for that, because it means that the government isn't interested in it. And likely, they won't even notice it until it is too late—that is, when their printing press (which is their greatest tool) becomes useless, and people start abandoning the dollar in favor of alternatives like bitcoin.

Very astute. Most people who object to Bitcoin's deflationary nature are operating from the Nirvana Fallacy, which leads to a habit of objecting to imperfect systems from the premise that a perfect one is an option. They just throw up some political economist's Platonic form of how a market "ought to work" and when Bitcoin doesn't fit the dream, they start bitching.
Perfection isn't an option, and once we get that out of the way, one might see why Satoshi thought, after weighing the advantages and disadvantages of deflation over inflation (which, outside of our non-achievable "Nirvana", are the only options), that deflation was the better option; or at least (to make a concession to the language of the Platonic idealists), the less-bad option.

A money that increases in value because it can buy more stuff represents a greater past output. The assumption that such a money would lead to a decreased future output has never been demonstrated empirically, and in theory requires that the same people whose productivity created the increase in wealth and corresponding money value would stop working because they got rich in money. That just doesn't happen. Productive people produce. Nor would they (or do they, in point of fact, in reality) fail to employ human resources in their production, because their savings appreciate. They intend to get more money in the future by employing others in productive processes.

Here's the problem with that regarding Bitcoin: there can be no "strong government intervention and control" without a state-controlled monetary system, unless it be by naked force. The latter ends either in famine or violent revolution; the former would be impossible in a world where Bitcoin was the coin of the realm.
Bitcoin is compatible with all sorts of ideologies that oppose centralized power structures, be they socialist or capitalist, communitarian or individualist; but opposing centralized power is something that Bitcoin frankly does, whether Its creators intended it to do so or not, and regardless of what any state supporter would hope to gain by Bitcoin's success.

Like it or not, it's both necessary and inevitable for people to bid the price up until we find out what it *should be worth* for the long run. And that price will include all the demand for bitcoin as a hedge, a monetary intermediary, *and* an investment. Once we reach that point we will see the deflationary curve flatten out. But if it does before then, bitcoin simply will not have the market cap to be widely adopted, and will most likely never get there either. Who wants a 150 year price discovery process? Not me.

Actually, that's not quite true. Fiat means "by government order"—the thing that gives it value is legal incentive to use it or disincentive (including fines and jail) for using other things.

Gold and silver assets will not severely devalue directly because of Bitcoin. Rather, the release of metals now used as money and saving from those uses would enable their use in industrial processes, in which the demand is high enough to keep their prices high. At some point, assuming the long-term success of Bitcoin, the incentive structure will drive industrial firms to purchase gold and silver from specie holders at a high price in exchange for bitcoins, and that's a win/win scenario if I've ever heard one.
You're right that the eventual relative non-scarcity of precious metals is an issue for gold and silver holders in the long run, but the only people who will lose on that will be those very few goldbugs whom the neoclassical economists rightly call "gold fetishists". Everyone else would long before have adapted to and profited from Bitcoin's superior incentive structure.

But I disagree; they won't make anyone richer. What they **might** do is effect a **more** equitable distribution of wealth, according to which people are rewarded more along the lines of the actual value they produce. And that would mean that **most** people would become richer in the short run; however, those who now benefit from the money system we have now would lose vast fortunes. In the long run, everyone would get richer because parasitism would be weeded out by market forces, but the currency wouldn't be the cause of that; only an enabler. That is, a better, fairer currency is a necessary but insufficient condition.

You could send them through a "tumbler" that would replace them with randomly-selected bits of coins and then send them to a number of addresses all controlled by you in one aggregated balance (I think Armory does this). As for fees, I don't know of any tumblers that don't charge fees, but theoretically there could be one. It would take a LONG time to get your coins back, though, since fees prioritize confirmation.
The best way to keep things quiet would be not to link an address to any personal identification in the first place, and do everything pseudonomously. You could tumble any coins you need into a separate address specifically for transactions that require you to use your real name or a real address, or even keep two separate chains of transactions (going all the way back to acquisition) for the those you are willing to have personally linked to you, and those you aren't.
If you're careful, there's really no way that anyone can prove that you own or use the coins at any given address unless you choose to link them to yourself. Or unless, say, you were forced by a government to self-incriminate. But it's your responsibility.

Saving results in lower prices which means that purchases in BTC tend to be a better deal than purchases in fiat, leaving more fiat with which to buy those things that are not yet available for BTC.

The options:
1. Inflation and consequent devaluation. This would not solve the supposed problem because those who first receive new money (miners, in this case) are always the beneficiaries of its purchasing power. By the time new coins got out into the economy thier value would have decreased along with that of bitcoin in general, thereby harming non-miners.
2. Create all the coins at once, bypassing mining altogether. Which would put all of the coins in the hands of the developers, not unlike the central bankin system to which Bitcoin is intended to be an alternative.
3. Make new coins through a process in which *anyone can participate* that compensates work and expense while also providing Bitcoin's security features.
The creator(s) of Bitcoin chose the third option. Tell me why I should prefer one of the other two.

It's not even "by the people". It's of the lawyers, by the lobbyists, for the corporations.
Every person and his friends are "the few", and people will always act in the best interests of them and theirs. Human psychology is fundamentally incompatible with true majoritarianism. Not that majoritarianism is a worthy goal, either - mobs have been trampling minorities throughout all of human history, regardless of the purported design of their governments. Indeed, the few often use the stampeding herd of the "majority" to direct society in a way that is beneficial to them. If Bitcoin succeeds, it will be great not because of its ability to effect the will of majorities, but because it will give individuals the ability to exercise due control of their own lives and property by putting their value in a form to which neither the power elite nor the stampeding herd have trivial access.

Then you simply fail to see what others see. Rational means whatever a person thinks is in his best interest at the moment of action. That doesn't mean it's correct, however. Leeching was perfectly rational as long as people thought it worked; now that we know it didn't, it would be irrational to employ it.
But there is good reason for one to believe that using bitcoin now is in his best interest. If someone offers me a discount for paying in bitcoin, then I am left with more fiat with which to buy things that I need and can't get with bitcoin.
In case it's not clear, here's an example.
I need a pair of shoes, fuel for my car, to pay rent, and food for the month. I have $1000. Rent will be $600, I will need $200 for food, fuel costs me $150 per month, and that leaves me $50 with which to buy shoes. Here's the problem: $50 will buy a pretty crappy pair of shoes.
But I've saved some bitcoin. It used to be worth $100; now it's worth $1000. I can use 1/10th of it to buy my boots and have $50 left over to do something else that I would otherwise have been unable to do.
The fact that I may have been able to buy a yacht with that $100-worth of bitcoin does not outweigh my present need for shoes. That is what time preference means: no amount of promised future value can ever completely outweigh all present need.
Besides, I can always buy more bitcoin later, and still get my yacht in the hypothetical future. According to my values, I have gained something by spending bitcoin and lost nothing by spending bitcoin. Spending bitcoin was the only rational thing for me to do.
The thing that made all the difference was the discount. And the appreciation of bitcoin is what made that discount possible, because the merchant knows that the bitcoin he accepts from me today will be worth more tomorrow.
Now obviously appreciation carries a disincentive to spend. Nobody is denying that, although we would argue that it can never be sufficient to override all present need. But as the price of bitcoin levels out following the satiation of demand for bitcoins as a store of value (savings), that disincentive will decline, and the need for discounts to encourage spending will also decline.
It will never reach zero, though, and that is not a bad thing. A deflation that is based only on a relative shortage of money is not the same thing as a deflation that is based on there being more actual wealth in an economy. Nor is deferred consumption undesirable. Rather, it is the only thing that permits technological development to occur; and where it is common, savings tend to be invested in such technology.

Also, outside of Hollywood portrayals, the American West was far more peaceful on a *per capita* basis than its Eastern counterpart, and the most violent of its cities (Dodge and Kansas, namely) were less violent *per capita* before their incorporation into the U.S. than afterwards.

Of course, the bigger a business is, the easier it is to regulate.

The only way the political class was ever able to control a majority of any economy was through inflation. They create new money and ensure that they and their supporters get it first, before the market has a chance to adjust to the new money by raising prices. In that way the people end up with increasingly worthless cash balances while the real wealth (access to goods and services) flows to the political class.
Unless they can force a hard fork and control the more successful fork, they cannot create new bitcoins. And without that, they can never be more powerful than the people. If the government invests in bitcoin they will be conceding defeat in the long term.

Which means that responsibility for one's financial security is socialized (in a sense). Bitcoin brings back *caveat emptor*, making everyone responsible for his own liability, either directly or through voluntarily joined insurance contracts. It will be a hard and painful shift, but I see it as a plus for Bitcoin in the long run rather than a drawback. Compulsorily distributing the cost of contract enforcement seems like a good idea at first, but issues of justness arise alongside economic sustainability once the costs of ignorant or stupid risk-taking are also forced onto the shoulders of those who did not take the risks. 
You made an understandable yet ignorant mistake; you paid the cost yourself. Now you are no longer ignorant, and in your state of non-ignorance are in a position to benefit as an early adopter. Count yourself blessed.

Yes, many of us disagree.

If Bitcoin cripples governments' ability to do that, it will do so by enabling the provision of those things in a non-coercive, non-monopolistic manner.

The deflation critics usually depend on the idea that a currency increases in value solely or primarily because of increasing demand for a fixed supply. But that ignores the fact that it is only an increased demand for goods that can result in demand for money in the long term, because even saving is nothing more than deferred consumption. And demand for goods is built into human nature.
But in that case, deflation is only neutral. There is a case in which it can actually be a good thing: when a fixed supply of money represents an *increasing* value of total goods for sale. Then the purchasing power increases because there is more stuff to purchase, and savers - those with more prudent consumption habits - will be rewarded with a greater proportion of that purchasing power than those who consume at a higher ratio.

This is largely because customers no longer believe it is their responsibility to vet sellers. *Caviat emptor* was not a callous response to complaining, cheated buyers. It was a statement of the annoying but factual matter that you are responsible for your own protection.
Not even the most far-reaching state can protect people from scams, but most people believe the opposite. They think that the fact that consumer protection laws exist means that any existing business can be trusted (until the mass media reports otherwise on a particular case). As with most of the government's promises, they get in the way of real solutions. And the sooner people realize that coming up with solutions is their responsibility, and not something that can come with the government's prepackaged promises to care for everything for everyone at everyone else's expense, the sooner those solutions will come.
That is to say, when there is a *market* for consumer protection again, consumer protection will be produced. Much in the same way that it is almost impossible for a manufacturer to sell an appliance at a major retailer without submitting it to the UL's quality assurance process (with which the government has almost no involvement), it will be almost impossible for businesses to operate on a profitable scale without giving assurance of their trustworthiness. But that won't happen as long as the government's false promises suspend *caviat emptor*. And I think the decentralization allowed by Bitcoin might bring it back.

By running drugs. Like I said before, most of their money comes from smuggling. If they don't have anything to smuggle, they aren't going to have enough money to pay their men enough to incentivize them to put their lives at risk! The entire history of piracy demonstrates this.


You think that a business will be less organized than a government bureaucracy? Well I guess that depends on what you mean by "organization".


"Competition" between law enforcement has far more in common with territorial feuds between gangs than it does with market competition. Firms on the market cooperate when it is convenient. What is convenient for a firm will be very different from what is convenient for a police force with a territorial monopoly. The police can give ass-all for their customers and still get paid. But the defense firm has nothing to gain by neglecting its customer's needs. I'm not paying them to play petty little power games with each other. And the great thing about markets is, if they try it, you can fire them all and hire one that will do what the hell you pay it to do.
Government police, all you can do is pay up and hope that the next one you run across will be somewhat reasonable.
All of your other objections apply at least as much to the state as they do to voluntary organizations; and likely more so, since the agents of the state get paid whether they do their job right or not, tend to be narcissistic control freaks and bullies, and are immune from competition; whereas a business that goes into business to protect people has every incentive and intention to actually protect people.


So, you want people who believe that central planning doesn't work to take on the role of central planners, predicting what innumerable individual minds might come up with for each and every problem, to satisfy your endless fear-based objections. That is not reasonable.

That's the thing: if you derive your politics from an identifiable principle applied consistently across the board, you're a "radical". People want politicians with their positions chosen piecemeal, who will tickle people's ears with promises that no mortal could ever keep, and reshape reality to fit the will of the voter.
For instance, it's impossible to love liberty and support a massive warfare state. But a politician who says so is just too unpleasant. A politician who reduces "liberty" to a meaningless slogan but says it when it seems right while the people cheer for massive expansions of state power... Now that's doable.

I know a fellow who gambled professionally for a while. He made enough to live on, but barely; and his advice to anyone who can't calculate odds on the fly is, "don't put anything on the table that you would not be willing to put on the bar instead."
This principle applies to *all* risk. Not just gamblers. Not just Bitcoin. Not even just all investing. If you don't have your day-to-day needs taken care of and a good emergency supply, then you should not be taking unnecessary risks. And investing, for most people, is not necessary. 
Bitcoin may be a safer risk than trusting banks in some places, but I don't think that's the case here (in the US, where I am, or in most of the Western world), ***yet***. Until it is, we should temper our exuberance in promoting it, I think. But the problem I see is that because Bitcoin is new, it is treated in the press as if it is uniquely risky. It is not, in fact, by any inherent virtue, more risky than any other investment. I think we should always remind people of that fact. Admit the risk, but don't allow it to be overstated.

No, though the political class *desperately* needs you to believe that you need them.


It is already a taxable asset. If you want to give them your bitcoin you can go right ahead. Nobody's stopping you. However, by the time Bitcoin gets big enough for the government to pay specific attention to it, they will have already begun to lose control of money (which is one of the very points of Bitcoin: decentralization of the control of money). And without that control they will lack the financial wherewithal to enforce their bloated, putrescent, idiotic tax laws. So I'm not too worried about it.


I'm not sure I know what you mean. Do you think that businesses destroy money or something? Or do you refer to the Keynesian chimera of the "deflationary spiral" or some other Krugmaniac bogeyman?

I think that in a free market workers actually would own the means of production, meaning that firms would be much smaller and there would be more cooperation among them.

Transaction costs have gone down significantly because of the Internet, as have communication costs in general, both in time and money. That has enabled more wealth to exist. Take away the Internet, wait a few months for the capital structure that sustains that wealth to collapse, and you'd see just how much the world has changed indirectly because of the Internet.

That's not how Visa, MasterCard, etc. formed their cartel. They did it by being established before the legal expense of operation became a strong barrier to entry.

What you *feel* regarding your bank comes from familiarity.

They, at least, seem to think that Bitcoin offers them a better chance at controlling their money.

You can even put it up to a committee and one member of that committee will ultimately take leadership, even if only implicitly, and make the decision.

A "crash" implies that it's objectively bad, but if the price needed to fall and it fell, then it was a *good thing*. Not a crash, but a *correction* to a market with too much, or too reckless, speculation. Bitter medicine perhaps, but nonetheless necessary; and one of the benefits of not having a central bank is that nobody can stop it from happening no matter how distasteful people find the medicine. And this will probably need to happen a few more times until the base of users and holders is wide enough to absorb the handful of panicky traders who trigger these events, on both the up and down sides.

He's right.
It's money "that some of us value", but as far as the government concerned (i.e., legally speaking) it's "Monopoly money". They won't regulate it until it's more than that to them. If all goes well for Bitcoin, that's an inevitable challenge. But for the time being, they don't think it's worth paying attention to; and as you said, the same thing goes for any country's currency. If Euros or Yen or Yuan or Rubles or Rial or Pesos or Canadian dollars start to threaten the US government's monopoly money (using the word "monopoly" in the technical sense), then we can expect the US government to freak out about those currencies, too.
Of course Bitcoin has differences that will, in the mind of the government people, merit a different response than the one that would be taken against foreign fiat. But only when they think it's worth their attention, and that's not yet. The King of the Hill is fat, slow, and stupid; and the very things that make Bitcoin different are advantages, besides.

Three points:
1. Pareto distribution does not always follow the 80/20 rule. It does so more often in a stagnant system, but markets are always dynamic.  
2. Pareto distribution applies under *any system*. That means that equality is impossible. But *equity* is not. It's not a matter of changing the distribution; that will be whatever it will be. Rather, it's about who gets to be in the upper bracket.
3. The only way that a group of non-producers has ever been able to occupy the 20% bracket is by being members of the political class. And here's where Bitcoin wins: it is immune to the sort of monetary manipulation that the political class always uses to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else.
Bitcoin offers us the possibility of a market liberated from political privilege. Such a society would tend to populate the upper bracket of wealth distribution with those who are most productive. Not those who are the greediest or the most willing to use political force.

Historically, when banks are subject to transparency, those with higher reserve ratios drive those with lower ratios out of the market. The tendency is for the average reserve ratio to approach 100%. Bitcoin's public ledger would allow that kind of transparency. And I don't think that any bank will be able to cope with having to keep close to a 100% higher reserve ratio when their entire business model is based on less than 10% and the Federal Reserve backing up the rest with their magic printing press.

Those aren't as pretty, and before gold was money its only use was as jewelry. Silver is a different case, as its uses in sanitation have long been well-known, but when it comes to other things (titanium, platinum, etc.) their uses only became well-known after the emergence of industry, which didn't happen until gold and silver had already been money for millennia.
Gold and silver are money because they have all the traits of "good money":
* Useful (even if only for decoration)
* Scarce
* Divisible
* Homogeneous
* Durable
* Non-counterfeitable
* Portable
And now they have been money for so long it wouldn't make sense to replace them with another metal that basically does the same thing. Bitcoin is another story—it does everything that metal does, and does it better:
* Usefulness: The Bitcoin protocol is useful for *far* more than just money.
* Scarcity: Not only is it scarce, but we know *exactly how much* there can ever be.
* Divisibility: Far more so, and far more easily than gold.
* Homogeneous: Completely, and without any need for a refinement process.
* Durability: Technically, bitcoins will last as long as the blockchain is stored on a single computer. However, the 
private keys can be easy to lose; yet with proper precautions, one's bitcoins are just as safe as one's gold.
* Non-counterfeitability: Given what we currently know about math it's basically impossible to counterfeit convincingly.
* Portability: instant and almost effortless.

I assume you're using the word "you" rhetorically, because I loathe fractional reserve banking and would never do such a thing myself. In fact, I consider it to be an act of fraud against people who receive FRB certificates in good faith.
But if a bitcoin loan market exists, then it is possible for some lenders to offer certificates for more BTC than they actually have. And it is possible for some people either to fail to check, and accept the certificates as fully funded in good faith; or for them to see a certain level of fractional reserve as an acceptable risk, and accept them in the knowledge that they are not fully funded. And it is possible for some merchants to receive those certificates, either not knowing or not caring that the BTC represented thereby do not exist, because they expect that more people like them exist and will accept said certificates. And the only thing that will stop the cycle is for someone to get those certificates who intends to redeem them for actual BTC, and find that the issuer is insolvent. But it is possible, in theory, for that event to be indefinitely postponed. In reality, it is probably inevitable, but it could take a very, very long time.
And so we can expect a margin of fractional reserve lending, albeit a very small one that is kept small by the fact that *someone*, eventually, is going to both do his research and give a shit. But it will not go away completely because of the sheer number of people who don't do their research and/or don't give a shit. And even though it may be just to suppress FRB as fraud, I don't expect enough people to agree with me for it to be ended. I may be an idealist, but I'm not a Utopian.

Their self-interest will only have that effect until they attempt to trade their huge balances of cash for real wealth. It doesn't matter if the money is worthless if they end up owning everything that could be bought with it anyway. Of course, the market would resist such a buying up of goods - with a huge increase in prices. They couldn't actually accomplish it. But the question isn't whether they could do it or not. the question is whether they would be stupid enough to try.
All it would take is for one large holder of cash to divest to trigger a massive inflationary spiral, because all the others, anticipating the decrease in the purchasing power of their own balances, would have to hurry up and buy. And of course the response to the rise in prices would be the issuing of more money - voila! Hyperinflation.
And we also have to count on non-material motivations - most of all, power. If a significant number of them have a "better to rule in hell" attitude, then we cannot expect their self interest to preserve the integrity of the dollar system.

Not to do whatever they want with it. Do they have permission to burn it? To give it to other people? No, of course not. And by the same principle they do not have permission to dump it into bad risks. Good faith is a legal principle; they break it constantly. The government looks the other way. If a private individual took your money in good faith and then invested it in a severely undercapitalized startup and went broke, you could sue him, and you'd probably win. Not so with banks. They actually could burn your money, and they would suffer no penalties for it, provided they were "too big to fail" enough.

And if the guy selling me the shoes makes me a deal for less BTC than I would otherwise pay in fiat, he leaves me with more fiat with which to buy the things I need that are not available for bitcoin. That savings is important, even essential, to me now, and it is quite worth the loss of a small portion of the expected future value of my bitcoin. Hence the importance of discounts in bitcoin markets, which are not lacking now, but which still do need to be promoted.

People might be more likely to listen to a post that doesn't contain the word "circlejerking" in the title, because it's a stupid, juvenile expression and no matter how good your point is, calling people out for "circlejerking" is beginning to sound a lot like calling Republicans "racists" and Democrats "communists" in the opening round of debate.

The realization came to nobodybelievesyou as he stared down into the empty volume of his fourth consecutive quart jar of mayonnaise. It sat between his legs, which were folded Indian-style on the filthy square of shag carpet. He noticed a blob of the condiment sliding gradually from the inner rim of the jar into the widening interior. Nausea encroached as he noted how much like a slug it looked. He slowly started to rise, his stomach gurgling protest; but his legs were too cramped from having been folded before him for so long.


He thought. Perhaps five minutes per jar.  Maybe less—he had been shoveling the stuff down pretty fast.
He reached up to set the ladle-sized spoon on the corner of his desk, not considering the large, greasy mess it would leave, including on the edge of his mousepad. Later he would chide himself, but for now, rising from the basement floor was top priority. He grasped the edge of his desk and strained upward. The desk creaked and popped; so did his knees. The gurgling continued, and now it was a bit lower. Finally standing, he started laboriously to the squalid refrigerator in the opposite corner of the basement room.
Suddenly, the gurgling intensified, and he knew what was going to happen but was powerless to stop it. It rushed out of him in a thick, wet wind that immediately filled the room with a heavy smell like putrid milk and... was that sauerkraut? He hadn't had sauerkraut for days. He stood, despondent, feeling the sodden wetness at his posterior.
The part of his brain where he had filed hygiene cried out desperately for his next act to be to clean himself at the toilet. But that part had lost its importance to him a long, long time ago. And so he finished waddling to the refrigerator instead, grasped the grimy handle, and extracted one more quart of mayonnaise. Again he crossed the room, taking up the scoop from the desk, hoping against hope that this jar would last him for as long as he would be needing to sit on the toilet. But deep down, where the surest conviction resides in even the most wretched of souls, he knew it wouldn't.

Banks existed for thousands of years before large-scale lending was even economically possible. They have a distinct role besides lending, that is, safely storing people's money - and they've gotten pretty bad at that over the past few centuries because of their integration with lending on a fractional reserve.
Bitcoin would force a distinction between banks and lending institutions and likely replace the former.

So would it be a "fundamentally good thing" for governments to restrict the use of anything that is useful for facilitating indirect exchange? Or just Bitcoin? And how is it a good thing for the government, which as a matter of legal definition is a corporate monopoly, to restrict trade?

In the short term, taking a "right" action in ignorance may be worse than taking a "wrong" action with a bit of knowledge about what one is getting one's self into. At least the latter can cope when the seas change, which, in the long run, they will.

Yeah. But the only way to curb excessive speculation (to close the gap between the speculative price and the price representing goods and services offered) is for more people to start accepting BTC for stuff. So I'm happy to see the price has stopped rising for the time being, giving the real goods and services market time to catch up while short-term speculator/hoarders sell off to the savers, spenders, and investors.

It is different. The nine justices are all chosen, empowered, and paid by the same organization, and as we should expect, they tend to find in favor of that organization's power and the privilege of its members. Even when the SCOTUS disagrees with itself it is usually either over a question of method, or perhaps degree.
So what if the EFF were considered to have the same ability to render legal opinions as the SCOTUS? Obviously their opinions would tend to be different. So let a third organization, also of equal authority, decide cases between the two. Or rather, choose that third party from among the best qualified and reputable of large number of organizations without a direct interest in the case.

Price discovery must come before stability becomes possible. If the acceptable long-term price is much higher than the current price (which it must be in order for bitcoin to have widespread use in any application) then we cannot hope for stability for a long time.

Central management of the money supply doesn't work today because no person or group of persons can ever know the ideal quantity better than the market, which consists of ALL THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE.
And a computer program will only be as smart as its programmers. Someone figured this out once (I'll find the link if it interests you that much): a computer having the upper limit in theoretically possible processing power would take longer than the life of the Universe to figure out how to price a single commodity good. To think that a computer is going to figure out the proper price of money is absurd. In the best case, assuming computers that break every theoretical limit now imposed on them, it could only be as smart as the market itself; in which case, it would be redundant.

How do you know that a fundamental value has not already been established in bitcoin as a hedge, or as a money transfer system? Or that that value is not much, much higher than the current value of bitcoin? And even if it is lower than the current price, the "fundamental value" of bitcoin should be somewhat higher than the total value of goods and services being offered for it, because people are, in fact, using it for other things than exchange, and they wouldn't be using it unless they valued it.
You're right, we need the bubble to pop and stay popped for a while to tighten the margin of speculation. But there's no reason to assume that that correction needs to be as huge as many seem to think.

*Archos* means a power disparity between one person or group of persons and another. Bitcoin will affect power disparities, and its effect will be to mitigate them. So Bitcoin is inherently against *archos*, and therefore anarchic. Though the OP is correct: it is not anarch*ist*. The former describes an effect, the latter a belief. Software doesn't believe anything.
