They should send you an email saying that you didn't have sufficient funds. It's happened to me before when I was using the wrong account. I got the email within 5 minutes.

Correction just means it's dropping to a reasonable, which is subjective for the most part, price.

Not simultaneously with the same BTC. It's one or the other.

It's always going to be the price of 1 whole coin/share my man.
You'll tell it "sell when 1BTC becomes $15,000 but stop if it goes below $14,500", and whatever money you receive will be relative to how much you actually own. In your case it will be 0.75BTC multiplied by the price it sold for. 
Example: If it sells for $14,800 you would then receive $11,100.

There will be a larger correction coming. Wait for it.

You're making this way too confusing for yourself. Stop-limit simply means this.
I want to sell at price X (stop price), but do not sell if the price goes below Y (limit price).

You're the type of person who fell for "free armor trimming" scams on runescape. Yes, it's a scam.

Maybe someone can give me some insight, but I fear that is a large downfall of Bitcoin. If no one wants to sell it at $10,000 why on gods earth will anyone part ways with their coins IF it reaches something like $50,000? What is the incentive to spend it? There really isn't one. It's much more enticing to hold it for capital gains.

Dollar-cost averaging sounds right up your alley.
