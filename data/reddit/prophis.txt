lol NO. BTC and Bitcoin both mean bitcoin. Unless you are invested in bitcoin cash and want people to do the same so you try to sneak it in by confusing outsiders.

Why do religious people hate Darwin? Because they're told to think a certain way.

Dumb fucks? I've been buying &amp; hodling since 2015. I'm not anywhere near a loss. I'm just sick of people jumping on board then immediately freaking out and selling.

Then good for you, honestly. hopefully you made money. When these panic dips happen, noobs often lose money and go on talking about how bitcoin is no good.

More people need to watch this

Thanks I'll check out both

I believe there's only 21 million total, so if you have at least 1 youre in the 21 mil club

I've been following BTC for about 3 years, but haven't heard anything that makes BCH sound good or like a better option. I have a little bit of ETH as well as some other alt coins
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:51:58
Totally agree. Especially never go all out, never go full retard.

Look at this clown.

Congrats. Looking forward to your 5 and 10 year regret posts.

SO GOOD!

Congratulations. Now delete this post.

Just coinbase
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:07:32
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:38:18
My goal was to try and get at least 1 before the halvening in 2020
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:42:21
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:26:53
Would you say it's better than coinbase or any other exchange until you can get a hardware or same thing?
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:36:54
Fingers crossed! Not a fiat fan so this is the move to make
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:11:27
Honestly that's bad ass. Keep it up, and HODL.

I know of a Nigerian prince who will give you all his bitcoin if you just send him some of your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-04 23:48:34
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:15:19
Delete this post, and HODL.

I've had good experience with them in the past and hear they're support is on point. Thinking about using them before getting a hardware wallet. Thanks for your opinion.
@_date: 2019-05-04 04:35:17
Thanks everyone, looking into hardware wallets now

Lightning introduced near instant transactions, and mass adoption due to this.
