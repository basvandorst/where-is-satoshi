Why are people still using corporate level banks? My Credit Union could care less about what I spend my money on unless it shows multiple out of state purchases for fraud related reasons. Switch to a Credit Union. Money you hold in the bank is used to fund other people's loans in the bank. Help your community both within Bitcoin and your town.
