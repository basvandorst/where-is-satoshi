i'm sure he's quite proud of his american prominence by now. I have to assume he's a clueless moron of epic proportions who is looking forward to being someone's FAT Bitch in prison! :D

seriously, dogecoin only helps awareness, especially when it has that "Silly" element to it. i see nothing wrong with DOGE coin, in fact i have some. (Edit - Downvotes expected i suppose. meh. noone knows, so why speculate?)

Andreas doesn't work there, he works for blockchain.info... or am i missing something?

but - i've never used bitcointalk in my life. and i got spams this am. i did have an acct at gox, but never used it, i "deleted" it a month or two before they went under, never even verified anything - TL;DR, then I just left until some spam from them came and i remembered to clean up my dead account .... (Good thing in hindsight!) :D

it is pretty brilliant. i can see now why people think a gov't funded source with peer review created it (or put your theory here lol) - Because , well - i find it hard to believe one man could achieve such an amazing system alone. and if so, i don't think A. He's actually Dorian - and B. Whoever he TRULY is, I don't believe he's not completely unknown &amp; hiding out there - he is someone very well known in other circles i would reckon, however, it's all speculation. kinda like bitcoin. ... see what he did there? .. genius. :D

Didn't anyone here even read the original whitepaper? why is this even a topic? 
Edit - Just because something is possible, that does not always make it wise and/or actually feasible in the long run.

Well, fwiw, i was not in the list, but i do have an account, and I Did get phishing/requests for BTC this am, just like the ones people have posted screenshots of.... so ... there is that... :\

@_date: 2014-02-12 16:35:35

another thing to note - he has many btc stored in cold already for his kids. i know that sounds lame/or whatever(?), but it's close to 1 mil. why give a guy with a million more btc? I mean... i guess it's up to you, but stilll.. be aware lol.
