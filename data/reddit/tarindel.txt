There's no disagreement that having more nodes would benefit security.  However, making nodes easier to run isn't going to significantly increase the number of users who run nodes, because the issue ultimately isn't one of economics for end-users.  It's an issue of incentives.  You could make nodes 4 times easier to run and the number of new nodes run by end-users that come online isn't likely to increase substantively.
So it feels like trying to optimize to make nodes easier to run is the wrong solution.  The solution to node decentralization is to fix the incentive structure to make running nodes rewarding for end-users.  Otherwise the number of nodes will always be small, and thus trivial to attack for a large entity like a government, if they were so inclined.
But I'm assuming that's not in the cards for Bitcoins.  So we're almost stuck with having businesses be the ones running farms of nodes (since they're the only ones who really have incentives to do so, to protect their business investments).
And as long as that's the case, then I'd favor optimizing for things that _do_ have an impact, like scalability.

Why do we have to pick?
If the two are correlated, they should move together to some degree.  More adoption should increase demand, leading to higher price.  Higher price will drive attention, which will increase adoption.
@_date: 2017-02-27 23:02:43
You're still missing the bigger picture.
Even if nodes took minimal resources, most people still would not run them.  You're an outlier (and thanks for your participation).
I wasn't trying to argue that the number of nodes wouldn't increase -- it clearly would.  But imo a 4x increase in the number of nodes from where we are today isn't substantive.
A government, or even a business, with ill intent would have no problem spinning up 25,000 nodes if they were compelled to do so.  Assuming a cost of $1000 a node, that's only a $25M investment.
The bigger picture is that the node decentralization problem is not solvable by making nodes cheaper.  So why are we killing the usability of bitcoin to try to provide more security when the amount of added security in doing so is insubstantial?
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:36:40
It's funny you mention this, because I was thinking about just that phenomena when writing this.
Two additional thoughts here:
1) With normal roads, you're right -- adding lanes increases congestion longer term.  This happens because people end up living farther away from where they work and commute longer distances.  I'm not sure the situation with bitcoin is analogous, because the distance between the origin and destination of a bitcoin transaction is inconsequential to how long it uses the network.  It's more likely that a doubling of the block size will allow for a doubling of the transactional capacity before the same amount of congestion happens.
2) Regardless, eventually 2MB blocks will fill up -- so this isn't a "solution".  It's a mitigation strategy.  And there's nothing wrong with leveraging a mitigation strategy in the short-term while you working on a long term solution.
That's the larger point of my comment.  We don't have to pick.  We can do them all.
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:18:21
Satoshi himself said that he didn't expect most users to run nodes.  Given the incentive structure of nodes (aka. none) this makes sense.  Only large economic players will run nodes in the future, and that's fine, as long as there's enough of them.
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:50:36


Not really -- moving to a new city takes effort on the part of the end users of the roads.  This is more like building a new highway with twice the number of roads next to the old one.  Users don't have to do anything different to use the new highway once it's rolled out.

To expound upon that, suppose there were some external stimulus X that caused both price to wane and BU adoption to increase.  In that case you'd see exactly what is shown in that chart above, but the price waning would be due to X, not BU adoption.
I leave it up to you to determine what valid X might be: full blocks, altcoin price increases, Segwit being stalled all seem like feasible choices to me.
@_date: 2016-01-21 03:21:49
My best guess is that if the hard fork to 2MB is activated with a 75% majority, Core will be quick to follow with a hard fork to 2MB to remain compatible with the new majority chain.
All of the other options seem devastating to Core's long term viability.
@_date: 2016-03-07 23:18:38


Yes, but by then we'll have rolled out segwit (probably), lightning will at least be closer to reality (probably), and we'll have had another year's worth of time to work on other scaling solutions (not just throughput solutions).
I think too often we're too focused on trying to find perfect solutions -- and we let that be the enemy of good enough for now.

This.  Having read through the original post, I understand where the macro-level concerns are, but not at all why 2MB crosses some mysterious threshold that is dangerous/insecure/prohibitively expensive (for nodes)/non-performant whereas 1MB doesn't.
Under what justification are 2MB blocks considered so dangerous that splitting the community, spawning many alternate solutions, and potentially causing a [contentious] hard fork is preferable?

Unfortunately this.  The fees are kickbacks to the venues.
@_date: 2016-03-04 19:59:06
Poor analogy.
Classic is trying to relieve road congestion by doubling the number of lanes now.
Core is trying to relieve road congestion by introducing busses (lightning) at some point in the future.
Both camps want segwit as soon as possible, so that's not a specific benefit for either.
Personally, I don't see why all of these ideas can't be leveraged.  2MB should relieves congestion in the short term.  This gives us enough time to introduce segwit and have enough of the community adopt for it to start making an actual impactful difference.  Then lightning can be rolled out when it's ready.

You are misquoting, sir.  In that screenshot, he's speaking hypothetically.  You can tell because he says, "It would be very easy to do".  "Would be" does not mean "is".

BU is clearly not unsafe to run in a status quo capacity.  You could be correct in a big-blocks capacity at this point in time.  But I'd argue that BU isn't likely to activate soon anyway, and if the market is efficient and works as it should, any risks will be properly evaluated and any necessary corrections or mitigations taken long before BU ever has a chance to activate (or, if that doesn't happen, BU will never come close to activation).
There's enough money in the picture to keep most people honest.  Or at least lay out their obvious biases (*cough*).
@_date: 2016-12-07 01:18:40
Sure, we're running up against the utilization cap of Bitcoin, which means we get huge backlogs every time blocks are found slower than average, and makes spam attacks cheap.  Migrating to a larger blocksize will have some negative consequences to decentralization (though I suspect it's smaller than some people think), but will lower utilization, and allow us to burn through transaction backlogs faster and increasing the cost of spam attacks.
We'll eventually reach this point again with whatever blocksize we hypothetically pick, but kicking the can down the road is a legitimate short-term response to a problem while you work on longer-term solutions.

@_date: 2016-12-08 21:03:04
I see your point, though I think the amount of testing that's appropriate can and should be proportional to how likely that code is to be used.
It made sense to test the crap out of Segwit because there was a reasonable expectation that it could be activated soon, so there needed to be confidence that it was READY.
BU's large blocks feature isn't in the same boat, as we're not even close to the activation threshold.  It's essentially an experimental feature.  I wouldn't expect it to have the same level of testing as segwit yet.
Over time, assuming there's interest from the market participants, the testing and proving will happen, and that will or won't increase confidence and adoption.
That's why I'm not all that worried about speculating on how trustworthy the BU devs are, or whether there are enough of them, or how good they are at theorizing or coding -- if you believe the Bitcoin markets are efficient, the market will supply the proper amount of caution and validate that the risk matches the incentives before any reasonable chance of adoption takes place.

Op clearly doesn't understand how good business practices work.
We don't need high fees now because miners are still being subsidized by the block rewards.  Holders are already paying fees whether you use Bitcoin daily or not in the form of inflation.
Setting up a fee market now is premature and a result of utilization running too high, nothing more.  Anything else at this point is a smokescreen.

In a housing situation, I'd agree, that would be grossly negligent.  But your analogy is flawed, because it's not the foundations that are poor -- they're working just fine, as evidenced by the mining pools already using them.
A better analogy would be selling someone a house where nobody is sure whether there are skeletons in the attic.  Some people think there are, others disagree.  But as long as nobody goes up the stairs (and right now, they can't be pulled down anyway), it's not very relevant.  Maybe it will be someday.
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:07:00
Invalid argument.  Your analogy is flawed -- engines are swapped out in their entirety.  BU hasn't ripped out the central part of the code that makes the software work.  They've just made selective changes it.
A better analogy would be that they've added some aftermarket items and tuned the engine a bit differently.

While I was speaking generally, last I heard BU branched from the pre-segwit Core, so unless they've integrated non-segwit parts of Core 13, there is a divergence right now.  That doesn't diminish BU though, it's still mostly Core code, just a slightly older version.
Looking forward, if segwit activates, I'd expect BU to incorporate it, thus reconverging.  If it doesn't activate, then it doesn't really matter, because that part of the Core code won't be used anyway.
@_date: 2016-12-21 21:57:10
Most big blockers feel decentralization of bitcoin development would be healthy for the ecosystem.  You can agree or disagree with that, but the objective certainly isn't to "seize control".  It's to ensure bitcoin is properly decentralized in all areas, to increase overall robustness.
@_date: 2016-12-21 22:56:14
I'm not talking about the number of developers working on a single project.  Core itself may be decentralized in terms of number of developers working on it, but there's still a systemic risk here.  What if Core's priorities diverge from what the rest of us feel Bitcoin should be?  (Many people think this has already happened).
Having other competing projects vying for mindshare in any ecosystem is healthy, regardless of the internal structure of those projects.
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:02:42
Sure, but that's hyperbole.  Two mining pools are running BU now, so we can reasonably say it's working as expected under current conditions.  The real question is what happens should the larger blocks feature enables.
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:43:23
Invalid argument.  BU is mostly Core code.That's the great thing about open source.  One larger team can maintain the base version and other smaller teams can maintain splinter versions that are mostly the same but with a few tweaks.
As long as those splinter versions don't vary too much from the base version they can keep integrating patches from the base version while maintaining their independence.
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:59:15


This is a strawman -- I did not suggest nor imply anything of the sort.
More users = more people purchasing bitcoin to spend, and temporarily holding it while they wait to spend.  Once they spend, merchants will also likely hold some portion of this temporarily before converting back to fiat.  This temporary holding is insubstantial at the individual level but powerful in aggregate, with enough new users.
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:25:24
Basic macroeconomics:
* Bitcoin has a fixed supply
* The more users there are, the more demand there should be (in absense of applicable substitutes)
* Fixed supply and increasing demand = increasing price
If you believe that Bitcoin for some reason violates the basic rules of macroeconomics, then you should state why, not just that it's "f*&amp;king silly" like it's obvious to everyone.
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:31:45
Releasing code that has no reasonable chance of being activated or run is effectively the same as not releasing it at all.  You're quibbling about morals for a case that's practically irrelevant.
It's also inaccurate to say the code hasn't gone through review or testing.  It has, though not to the degree I suspect any of us are comfortable with given the implications of activation.
@_date: 2016-12-08 19:59:37
That could happen.  
There are two related questions in my mind:
1) How many coders are reasonably needed to validate and maintain the tuning?
2) How much time is needed for testing before we can have a reasonable amount of confidence it works as expected?
The latter question is the one that's actually much more interesting to me.  Would the new engine blow up when we turn it on?  We don't know yet -- there hasn't been enough testing to give us confidence.  The good news is that we have plenty of time left for testing and further tuning since BU isn't likely to active anytime soon.
Most of the arguments I'm seeing here are emotional -- essentially, "I don't _trust_ BU devs to do a good job".  I'm not sure what part of that is misunderstanding of how open source software and code forking works, how much of it is due to propaganda, and how much is actually just a lack of trust in the readiness of that code to do what it would do if it were enabled.
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:37:04
Honestly, I don't give this response any more or less credence than the original rumor that they were going to accept bitcoin.
Companies publicly deny things they're working on all the time, because they don't want to tip off the competition or "promise" things to consumers that they aren't sure they're going to deliver.
Their denial of working on it is as credible as the statement that they were going to offer it.  Until it's officially announced, or until credible inside information leaks, who the fuck really knows.

The number of subscribers is an _awful_ metric to use, as anyone who has ever subscribed to r/bitcoin over the years it has been in existence is included in that subscriber number.  That includes people who haven't visited in years, sock puppet accounts, etc...
A better proxy would be the number of active users, which right now is about 3:1 in favor of r/bitcoin, but even that is flawed, since there's no direct correlation between which subreddit people visit and where they fall on the blocksize issue (I regularly visit both, for example).
But perhaps more to the point, the number of aggregate redditors barely matters at all.  The only thing that matters are whether the miners and nodes will adopt a hard fork branch or not.  If the majority of those adopt, the hard fork happens regardless of how many users on r/bitcoin feel like it shouldn't.

I think I would use this, but I'm not sure how feasible it is in situations where the price of bitcoin inflates quickly.
At first I was thinking I'd like to have a threshold (call it X), where once I spent more than X (bitcoins or dollars, not sure), Coinbase would make a purchase on my behalf for that amount.
The problem is, if X is denominated in bitcoins and the price inflates significantly between my first and last purchase, the cost in dollars will be extreme and unexpected.  For example, if X = 10 bitcoins, and I spend 9 bitcoins when bitcoins are at $10, and 1 bitcoin when bitcoins are at $1000, Coinbase would buy 10 bitcoins at $1000 and I'd go broke.
If X is denominated in dollars and the price inflates significantly between my first and last purchase, I may not get as many bitcoins back as I spent.  For example, if X=$1000, and I spent 90 bitcoins when bitcoins were $10 and 10 bitcoins when bitcoins were at $1000, Coinbase would buy $1900 worth of bitcoins, which would be 1.9 bitcoins when I'd spent 100 of them.
Not sure how to effectively work around this problem.

Given that most of the interest in BTC at this point is speculators, my guess is many of them are trying to:
1) Hop out of the market to limit their losses
2) Buy back in at a lower price if they can
Both of these things (along with Gox lag) tend to compound price drops.

I see lots of talk about people trying to time the market by selling at peaks and/or buying back in on dips.
Here's the part that I don't get.  Assuming:
1) You've made a reasonable gain on your initial shares
2) You plan to pay taxes on your gains
How is this likely to be profitable?
Here's an example of what I mean:
Let's assume I had $10,000, and bought 100 bitcoins at $100.  At $200, I think there's going to be a sell-off, I sell my shares for $20,000, realizing $10,000 in profits.  After tax, that's $7,200 in profit, plus my initial $10,000.  So I have $17,200 in cash.  Now, in order to break even with my original sale, bitcoin would have to drop to $172 a share (14%) just for me to purchase my 100 shares back!
So, what am I missing?  Are the people doing this:
1) Not having coins that appreciated in the first place, so capital gains is likely to be a smaller % (eg. less than 10%, which makes breaking even on a dip more likely)?
2) Not planning on paying taxes on the gains?
3) Not realizing how much of an impact capital gains tax has in the first place?
4) Something else?

Clearly you don't understand the concept of an *estimate*.
There are just short of 12 million bitcoins in existence today.  By ~~2040~~ 2140, there will be around 21 million.  To be more precise, that means there will only be 1.75 times as many bitcoins in existence as there are today, but this is napkin math so I rounded up.

This is baseless speculation: someone had an artificial wall at 120 and bought his own coins with another account to make it look like there was a buying frenzy.  Then other people jump on board, drive the price up a couple of dollars, and the person who bought his own wall sells at a higher price.

Seems to be pulled directly from MtGox.  You can get the same value from [Mt Gox]( (look at the "last price") in the top bar.
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:02:52
Clearly just pushing out weak hands.  You'll also note there's a constant stream of asks to push the price down.  Whenever one gets eaten, another one appears.
It'll be nice when there's enough market cap that we won't have to go through this on a daily basis.

I had the same reaction, I thought I'd been hacked.
I sent them a nicely worded request to change the word "executed" to "summary" in the email header to make it clear it's just a summary of past events and not a notice that something JUST happened.

We've seen quite a few other "stable" periods that last for 3 or 4 days while the market is being indecisive, and then are accompanied by a move up or down of 20%+.  Off the top of my head, after the big crash, we were stable in the 90s for a bit before we moved to 110ish, and then up to 120ish.
Personally, I'm expecting a move up for a couple of reasons:
1) News about investor haircuts are still circulating, I don't think Cypress is the last one
2) A lot of bad news is already priced in (Mt Gox vs Coinlab, SR being DDOSed)
3) Chinese folks are investigating Bitcoin and their investments should be starting to hit shortly
But I've been wrong before and definitely will be again.

Of course taxes on businesses have a way of being passed on to customers...

Agreed.  I want to see the running deals and sign up if and when I want to make my first purchase, not have to sign up to even see the deals in the first place.

Now things are going to get ugly.  It'll be interesting to see where the new bottom forms and what kind of bounce we'll get after.

Bitcoin will move on a logarithmic (exponential) scale.  Averaging is more useful as a linear measure.  A more interesting question is, over the next 10 years, what % will bitcoin rise per day?  Regardless of what the answer is, the bulk of the growth will occur at the end of the time cycle as the effect of compounding kicks in.

I have an order for 5 BTC that has been in the pending state for the last 48 hours.  It was temporarily added to my total, and then removed.
I'm not panicking (yet) -- but they do need to say something.
I sent them an email.  I'll report back if they respond.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:01:29
They just updated the messaging to "Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Friday Apr 5, 2013 at 04:56PM PDT after your funds have arrived. read more"
That seems to indicate that you'll now see this message only when they're at their transaction limits (rather than the previous, "sorry, we're at our limits, you can't buy anything" message) -- unfortunately, that's pretty much always.
The odd thing is that this seems at odds with their stated intention of removing the transaction limits soon (via twitter).

My purchase scheduled to arrive on 3/18 is complete.
My purchase scheduled to arrive on 3/19 is still pending.
My purchase scheduled to arrive on 3/21 is still pending.
My purchase scheduled to arrive on 3/22 is complete.
So it seems like new transactions might be working again but those that were scheduled to arrive between 3/19 and 3/21 are still stuck in pending.

Neat.  Find it interesting that Raspberry Pi was such a huge search term for this group.  Then again, I'm still waiting for an official Raspberry Pi distribution of the Armory client. :)

There's like no supply left at this point.  The price has run up so fast I don't think anyone has had the time (or inclination) to get their asks in.  The next wall is at 150, and it's not even a big one.
@_date: 2013-05-24 23:46:37
I think there's been a general upward pressure to the market over the last week, but someone was slowly offloading a ton of coins at around 123ish, which was keeping the price suppressed.  Eventually that person or entity ran out of coins, and the market moved up.  That upward movement caused others who were waiting on the sidelines to see which way the market would move after the "stable period" (even though it was artificially induced) to jump in, and pop.

Napkin math time.  If the market cap is $4B today, and the price is $350, at a $400B market cap the corresponding price would be $35,000.  But by the time that happens, there will be more coins in existence (we'll say double for estimation sake).  So that would imply about $17,500 per bitcoin.
It'll definitely be interesting to see what happens to bitcoin prices over the next few years, and doubly so when the next halving day occurs.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:19:23
Only if those coins are sold.  If all the coins mined in a day are held, no influx of funds is required to sustain the price level.
I'd be curious to know what % of mined coins are held vs sold.

If this were true, I'd expect some of the direct quotes above to show up on Google.  They don't.
@_date: 2013-05-01 15:50:35
I think it's a confluence of 5 things:
1) Silk Road being DDOSed (mentioned elsewhere on this thread) puts some downward pressure
2) Italy working out a new govt means less chance of bank bailouts = no new influx of cash
3) Lack of significant news otherwise means no buy or sell pressure
4) Market manipulation downward
5) Small market cap means whales can significantly move the market
You'll note we were listlessly bobbing between 140 and 145 for a while, until someone cashed out 10k bitcoins and drove the price down into the 127-132 range.  Along with some market manipulation to ensure there wasn't a rebound, we've settled into a new range, and we'll probably stay there until more news comes out.
My guess is we'll probably stay in the 120-135 range through the weekend.  If we drop below 120, look out below.  If we stay above, I think we'll be headed back to the 140s early next week.

I had two transactions scheduled to clear tonight, both the same.  One cleared, the other was flagged.  Very strange.  Email support and hopefully you'll get a response.  They've been pretty responsive to my previous issues, and that's why I keep spending with them.
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:45:18
My opinion is that it did.  Regardless of whether SR _actually_ drives a large portion of the market, there's a _perception_ that SR is a driver of bitcoin purchases at market rate.  SR gets DDoSed, people perceive that as bad news and sell, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
@_date: 2013-05-17 17:44:02
Assume that for an active trader, the fees are 0.33%.  To pull this off, you'd have to put up the wall as a ask, buy the wall, then sell higher.  3 transactions, so you're looking at a total fee of about 1%.  If you can drive the price up more than 1% (in this case, about $1.20) you'll net ahead.  You can also use some of the coins you just bought from yourself to put up a bid wall at the price you just bought, to ensure the price doesn't drop before you can get out.
Seems pretty feasible to me, at least in theory.
