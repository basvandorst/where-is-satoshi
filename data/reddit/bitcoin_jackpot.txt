Lowering reward causes bitcin price to climb. Supply and demand.

Serious question about LN and bitcoin. ( i had to comment because everytime i try to post this, it gets deleted????)
Correct me if I’m wrong but is this true?  I can't simply open up one channel on the LN and deposit money, and then anybody else connect to the same LN can transact with me.         
       
Example: Lets fast forward into the future where Walmart, Exxon, burger king, home depot are all using the LN. I would have to open a channel to each one of them, deposit money into each one of them and at this point I can transact with them? It’s not like there is a central place on the LN where all these companies are connected to and therefore I only deposit bitcoin once into a channel and then I can transact with any of those companies at will?     
Example  I have already deposited money into a LN payment channel. I come across a store that also uses the LN. At this point I cannot transact with them because I first have to open a payment channel with them, deposit bitcoin into this channel, get confirmed, then I can transact?     
Is that correct? If it is, that s u c k s and is disappointing.     
I still love bitcoin though.     
Thanks in advance.
