Lol. Still don't get it. That's like I buy a game in Euro and then complain that EUR USD moved and so I want the difference back.

Why cancel the transaction? Convert to market rate at the exact time of purchase. Price movements after the fact don't matter. Bitcoin is stable money. The problem here is that Steam is overcomplicating a simple process.

I don't see how this is a problem. If the fees are too high that's the customers problem. They can choose to pay in usd instead. Am I the only one that doesn't get it?

Lol, this is not news. Tether has been Untethered for years.

It's basically the same as when a stock splits. Holders of the stock end up with more stock at the same value. The value is now retained across more shares. Except the change in market value with crypto won't always equilibriate so it depends on the relative price movement of the two coins if you have inflation or deflation. For now, because miners jump to the new coin and sell it on the market at higher prices and because there is demand for the new coin, there is price inflation. But in an economy where there is no demand it could just as easily cause deflation.

Just HODL!!!!! Prices go up and down, you just bought at the most recent top. Remember that fear isn't real - it's just an evolutionary response to protect you from danger, but it isn't rational and professional traders will use it against you. Question whats different this time vs all the other times that Bitcoin dipped. Bitcoin has been around for over a decade, why ban it now after so long??? Remember how much it costs to make a bitcoin and remember that you only lose if you sell. Think in Bitcoin, not USD. Just HODL.

1 Bitcoin to the first rapper who wears this in a top 40 music video.

Yeah, same. It was all normal until he used the words North Korea and said someone might get killed. Dramatic much?

Lol, true. Just enough to ease my current liquidity crisis

Well said.

Neither - those aren't the only two choices.

Yes, the same way central banks make fiat. This has happened before with Ethereum though. Now you have ETH and ETC.
