They are created to be for 'Employees of X' 'Residents of Y' or 'Members of Z' and restricted in the Charter that is approved by the creating members (and the appropriate government agency) to that group.

If they didn't add BCH trading, I would have had to use a different exchange to convert; and lots of exchanges (Kraken, Shapeshift.io) block my state due to local consumer protection laws that Coinbase complies with.

'Whales' selling to large numbers of smaller users.

I was thinking of Vickrey Auction  fees
Where everyone only gets charged the lowest fee that made it into the block. and nodes would only accept full blocks from miners if the mempool is full enough to fill 2 blocks.
That way you can bid high to make sure your TX gets in; without inflating the price.
One downside is that wallet software wouldn't be able to predict your balance after a transaction... but I think people would cope with saving money.

So, I was thinking, if I made a Coin, I would enable Multiple POW systems.

@_date: 2017-12-06 09:22:37
Because otherwise someone dumping on the market could force you to sell for a lot less.
As an example, I forget all the details of what happened, but there was an ETH market that someone sold something like $10,000,000 at once, it filled ALL the outstanding buy orders down to $0.10! this then triggered everyone on that exchanges limits orders, who then also sold for $0.10! The price quickly rebounded, but some ETH where sold for pennies, even though the limit trigger was in the hundreds.
If on GDAX right now someone sold 16,000 BTC, the price would drop to only 5k, and there are people with more than that amount of BTC.

You are really underestimating the value of being able to put raw data into the blockchain itself, which is secured by Bitcoin.
A hash of a legal contact done over the internet can be inserted, as a virtual notary service.

Any valuable data can be time stamped forever using Bitcoin, and there is MASSIVE value in that.

“Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.
The argument goes something like this: "I refuse to prove that I exist,'" says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."
"But," says Man, "The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED."
"Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.
"Oh, that was easy," says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.”

@_date: 2017-08-03 00:04:11
My understanding:
BTC has a mostly unused Blocksize parameter; everyone mining BTC ignores it, and just does 1MB blocks, that are hardcoded into ASICs, etc.
BCC is changing that parameter to 8MB *to start with*, with plans to adjust it as needed in the future.
whilst BTC with Segwit is moving the transactions into a separate data block, and just recording a very secure signature of the transaction data.
BTC will keep the blockchain dataset small, but without detailed transaction info; while BCH will add every little transaction into their blockchain.
This being the Internet, I'm sure cunningham's law will apply to my response, as I am far from an expert.

(my understanding, having not read the white paper since 2010ish is) Bitcoin literally 'uses' encryption algorithms as make-work for miners to perform to generate blocks. Probabilistic "Proof of Work" where the miners race to find a digital signature that matches a required pattern.
Like having to roll 3 dice until you get triples; except because of the nature of the math there is no way to cheat over the internet, the only way to do it is to expend the energy of rolling, and rerolling for unpredictable results of applying cryptographic hashing to the transaction data blocks.

BCH is in the midst of a pump-and-dump;
look at the (market cap)/(trading volume) ratio compared to other currencies.
RULE NUMBER FOUR:
ANY STOCK THAT TRADES HUGE VOLUME AT HIGHER PRICES SIGNALS THE DISTRIBUTION PHASE.
When there was less volume, the price was lower. Professionals were accumulating. After the price runs, the volume increases. The professionals bought low and sold high. The amateurs bought high (and will soon enough sell low). In older books about market manipulation and stock promotion, which I've recently studied, the mark-up price referred to THREE times higher than the floor. The floor is the launch pad for the stock. For example, if one looks at the stock price and finds a steady flat line on the stock's chart of around 10p , then that range is the FLOOR. Basically, the mark-up phase can go as high as the market manipulator is capable of taking it. From my observations, a good mark-up should be able to run about five to ten times higher than the floor, with six to seven being common. The market manipulator will do everything in his power to keep you OUT OF THE STOCK until the share price has been marked up by at least two-three times, sometimes resorting to "shaking you out" until after he has accumulated enough shares. Once the mark-up has begun, the stock chart will show you one or more spikes in the volume -- all at much higher prices (marked up by the manipulator, of course).

“Cryptocurrencies can be used for anything from buying a cup of coffee to paying for a car, to crowdfunding a new startup and more and more consumers are choosing to use this type of payment.  To keep up with modern technology, we need to remove outdated restrictions on cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, and other methods of digital payment,” said Polis.  “By cutting red tape and eliminating onerous reporting requirements, it will allow cryptocurrencies to further benefit consumers and help create good jobs.”"

I want to put up a site that will double any bitcoin sent to it... eventually.
Every amount sent in would get immediately sent back out to the oldest sender in the queue, until they have received 2x what they sent in.  The queue would get longer and longer... one day... a week... a month... 25 years...
Site obviously would end well before the heat death of the universe, but it would be amusing to see how far it could go.

One of the big signs of a pump and dump is artificially high trading volume.
According to coinmarketcap.com over 1/3 the market cap of BCH has changed hands; while BTC; and almost every other currency less than 1/10th has.
What is happening is the BCH miners are trading with themselves at boosted prices to make the graph go up.
Normally, massive trading like that would incur fees... but since it's the miners coalition doing it, they are paying the fees to themselves, so it's basically free, plus the block rewards!
How could there be so much legitimate volume in BCH when it's still hard to find a place to buy, sell, or use it?

and no; Linux, for example, the most powerful account, root, has user ID of Zero; the same value as uninitialized memory; which leads to security holes.
For example, someone once slipped in code like: if (x &amp; 82 &amp;&amp; y | 37 &amp;&amp; userid = 0)
which allowed them to gain root access by passing in nonsensical flags to the function.
it also causes things to run as root by accident. If, for example a user specifies a user NAME instead of a user ID; the default response to the common string-to-integer functions is zero.
Basically, the default on Linux is full 'root' access.
