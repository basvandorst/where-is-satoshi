^ This is a very good point.  Getting out their phone, opening app, and scanning QR code is such a foreign idea to the layperson.  Adoption resistance isn't about one big barrier.  It is about hundreds of tiny obstacles.
As an analogy, merchants are migrating to smart chips and moving away from magnetic stripes here in the States.  Even though it has been about a year since the mandatory roll out has begun, I still default to trying to swipe my card instead of stick it in.  I have been swiping my credit/debit cards for 22 years.  It will take some time to be retrained.

Maybe you could just get paid in bitcoin futures contracts.  Guaranteed to be worth a specific value 30 days from payday.  That is kind of the reason futures exist.  It wouldn't work because the futures contract is illiquid, but I suppose you could spend on credit against the asset.  Too complicated.

I agree.  We aren't bitcoin salesmen.  I don't care if people think I'm a fool and I don't go seeking their approval.
Personally, I ask "what does it **mean** to back a currency in the first place?"  In the case of the US dollar, it is backed by the US government.  What does that mean?  They will drop bombs on people and shoot them in the face and stuff?  Because... dollar.  But because it is fiat, ironically the entity that damages the dollar is the very entity that is "backing it" in the first place.  The United States Government.  This is the case with any state currency, so through deductive reasoning you can see that state currencies clearly are backed by nothing but a politician's promise.
Bitcoin is backed by mathematics via the SHA256 algorithm.  If you believe we live in a world that 1+1 could possibly = 3, then bitcoin isn't for you.

I can't convince you.  It is entirely possible that a bigger better faster stronger cryptocurrency comes along and gains the trust of the world.  But consider this...
The most important attribute of currency is trust.  Trust that it is worth something.  Trust that it will be worth something tomorrow.
Bitcoin is slow to evolve with new features because hasty changes can introduce catastrophic bugs.  This is on purpose.  There is $300 billion on the line and a catastrophic bug would destroy that trust.
Competing currencies are healthy.  Survival of the fittest is good.  It will take a lot for an altcoin to gain the level of trust and recognition that Bitcoin currently has.
Until then, the only reason why people buy altcoins is because they perceive a bigger upside potential.  "Oh.. I missed the boat on bitcoin, but jesuscoin is the next big thing!"
For example scaling... None of these altcoins scale better than Bitcoin.  They just don't have scaling problems because nobody is using them.

Sure you have... :) just look at penny stock volatility.  They are easily manipulated because they are weakly capitalized.


Maybe it doesn't motivate anyone, but I believe it passively rewards people.  I see what you are saying about small impact, but for example, how many developers have actually contributed toward lightning network writing code and testing?  Less than 20?  I would say a lot of bitcoin's current value is influenced by the potential of lightning payment channels.  How about Schnorr signatures?  I would guess less than 10 devs have the skill set and are actively developing.  Fungibility has a huge impact on the value of bitcoin and Schnorr signatures will help preserve that fungibility.  Those handful of developers has a huge impact on the value of bitcoin.  In fact, without them BTC could eventually be worth nothing.
Just my two cents
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:31:36
This disruption will occur in phases.  Right now we are in the store of value phase.  Did you really think the entire world was going to instantly switch from fiat to an peer to peer digital cash system that is valued at $8/BTC?  It wouldn't be physically possible.  Duh.

Because a $1 million sell off will destroy a $5 million market while the same $1 million sell off will barely effect a $5 trillion market.  Because percentages.  Here is the data that backs up this fact:


I don't think you follow me.  If a developer already owns 50BTC and the value increases from $10,000 to $100,000 per bitcoin, the developer is rewarded by his holdings increasing from $500,000 to 5,000,000.  Developer contributions are after what open source projects are made of.  I would think that anybody actively contributing toward the bitcoin ecosystem already owns a few BTC.  Andreas Antonopoulos, for example, owns a few bitcoins (not a developer, but huge contributor).  Sure he gets paid to speak, but his contributions to bitcoin surely have increased the value of bitcoin.  So, he is rewarded with in increase value of his holdings.  Contributing toward the system is indirectly incentivized.

I keep my mouth shut about bitcoin and crypto relatively speaking.  I never wanted to be "the bitcoin guy".
I stumbled upon bitcoin in 2012 and I was like "huh... this looks super cool!" and mentioned it to a few friends and family.
At that time, any mention in the main stream media was regarding Silk Road or drugs or terrorism and the boogie man.
2013 was feverish.  Then Mt.Gox and the crash.  Anybody I had talked to about bitcoin was like ["Don't you feel silly now?"](
I held through 2014, 2015... [the pit of despair](  Nobody really talked about bitcoin or crypto until the end of 2016.  The speculators started blabbing about the Winklevoss ETF.  Then the ETF was denied and [bitcoin died again for the 1,000th time] (  Cmon' don't you feel silly now?
Then earlier this year, random normies on my facebook feed started talking about crypto.  "I doubled my money!"  "You should get in!"  More and more...  clueless soccer moms spewing garbage.  "Just sign up with Coinbase.  We are gonna get rich!"  "I made $5,000!"
Then they realized ETH and altcoins existed.  They started jumping on that.  Then ICOs.  They started jumping on that.  Not based on the value of the instrument, but just the proposition of getting rich quick.  "Easy money".
Now I get random phone calls and texts from people I haven't spoken to in years.  "Well it looks like I should have listened to you about bitcoin...  I missed the boat.  What do you think about goatcoin?  gizzardbux?  nomnomtek ICO?  anuswrinkle ICO?  Are they going to go up?  What is going to make me rich?"
They all just want to increase their dollar.  Anybody that "got in" within the past 6 months looks and feels like a financial genius.  Maybe my sample size is too small to get an accurate reading.  
Maybe the vast majority of the people getting involved with bitcoin now are excited about a revolutionary disruptive technology that could undermine the corrupt banking system and end the theft of value of state currency from it's citizens through manipulation and inflation?
I doubt it.  I think most of the people showing up just want to increase their fiat.  A select few of the intelligent ones "get it".  They come for the quick buck and stay for the revolution.

Segwit effectively doubled our block size.  Segwit is done and functioning.  If people actually started using segwit addresses we would drastically reduce fees.  But it seems people would rather complain about high fees and rush Lightning Network instead of use the features that are already there.

And as much as I want it to be deployed, I sure as hell hope they don't rush Lightning Network.  A catastrophic bug or exploit could severely harm bitcoin.

The reason for slow Segwit adoption is the exchanges that don't support it and the popular wallets that don't support it.
Coinbase... no Segwit.
Mycelium... no Segwit.
Blockchain.info... no Segwit.
Can we crowdfund Segwit integration for these wallets (not the exchanges like Coinbase of course)?
Just thinking out loud here; I'm not a DNM user but do they support Segwit?
The end user doesn't have many choices on how/where to use Segwit.  The developers need to step up and integrate it.  Unfortunately they don't have a financial incentive to do so.

Personally, not having that monthly mortgage payment over hanging my head *psychologically* allowed me to take entrepreneurial risks.  Some failed and resulted in up to 6 months with no income, but others succeeded very well.  Even with a "rainy day nest egg" I wouldn't have been able to take those risks if I had the mortgage payment burden.
Having a mortgage on the roof over my wife and kids' heads would feel like a bet that nothing bad would ever happen.  Even with an emergency fund, during those months with no income I would have definitely abandoned those projects and taken a 9-5 job.

Congrats man!  Owning a house free and clear is one step further away from wage slavery.  You will sleep well knowing as long as your property tax is paid, you will not have your home taken away.  Also, you will be able to put away what would normally go toward your mortgage into investments and retirement.
People will claim the tax deductible low interest mortgage makes more sense than owning free and clear.  I beg to differ.  Debt is the instrument that binds us to the wage slavery cycle.

Did you know... when you pay a merchant with a credit card they receive a "provisionary credit" to their bank account typically 1 or 2 days later.  Sometimes they don't even receive your money until 30 days later (in the case of "high risk" accounts like airline tickets or adult entertainment).  This provisionary credit can be revoked at any time up to 6 months after the initial transaction through a "chargeback".
tl/dr: Merchants don't actually receive the money you gave them until 6 months later (or a full day later depending on how you look at it).

So.. so far our Bitcoin sales have "doubled".  We went from 2 to 4 Bitcoin payments a month to 6 payments this month (December).  Apparently a 10% discount isn't enough incentive for our customer base to use Bitcoin.  Offering any more of an incentive really cuts into our profit margin and makes no sense from a business standpoint.
I have been working with our suppliers to have them accept BTC payments.  One of our suppliers agreed and we paid for one order with BTC.  Unfortunately, they are now asking for payment by bank wire because they "lost a lot of money exchanging BTC to their local currency".  They are located in Malaysia and I had referred them to   I'm not sure what BitX charges to exchange BTC to Malaysian Ringgit.  Does anybody have any suggestions for the SE Asia market?  Is there an equivalent to BitPay where they can receive payment and automatically settle in Ringgit?

I see what you are doing there and I get it, but...
What utility does your Huawei stock provide for you?  What can you physically do with it?  Perhaps receive dividends, and that is it?
I don't think the OP was comparing how neat BTC is vs how neat Huawei.  It wasn't a "competition".  The graph doesn't indicate BTC is "better" than those companies.  The graph simply points out what bitcoin would be worth if it had the same market cap as common stocks.  Thats it.  And I find it interesting.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:56:30
Of course it will.  I'm not being sarcastic.
As the utility of Bitcoin becomes more useful and convenient there will be more demand for the currency.  I think of "onramps" and "offramps".  Coinbase is a common onramp and offramp.  Spending BTC should technically keep the value in the Bitcoin space, but most vendors that accept Bitcoin are actually offramps because they are forced to sell Bitcoin for fiat since they are unable to pay their operating expenses with Bitcoin - at the moment.
Once the economic circle is complete and vendors are able to keep this circle complete there will be many less offramp transactions and more and more onramp transactions.  This increases the value of Bitcoin through the simple principal of supply and demand.
To add fuel to the fire, the USD is a bubble in it's self.  Quantitative easing and the like has inflated this bubble as it has shifted from the Real Estate Bubble and the Financial Sector Bubble into the Currency Bubble through market maniupulation.  As people see the utility and value of Bitcoin increasing, while the value of their USD decreasing, they will want to ditch their USD for BTC.  Hyperinflation of USD and hyperdeflation of BTC.
To say one Bitcoin will be worth $47,500 US Dollars is not a bit stretch, but the questions is what will one US Dollar be worth at that point in time?  Will a cheeseburger cost $4,000 US Dollars?
See  1 dollar was worth 4,200,000,000,000 marks!  Was the Dollar going up or the Mark going down?  Most of the time it is a combination of both.

As a fellow merchant I'm very interested in this as well.  Currently my websites accept BTC using the blockchain.info API, which sucks.  I started off integrating with electrum gear, but blockchain.info API was quicker and I was under the gun to get it done quick.
The idea of using BitPay or Coinbase is just absolutely stupid to me.  It is cash man... the whole concept is it should be P2P!  Using bitcoin BitPay or Coinbase to receive payments is like paying a bank to manage your cash register at your store.  The only benefit is instant BTC-USD conversion but if you have to instantly convert BTC to USD your business is under-capitalized and margins are too low (IMO).
I wonder how those guys do it on the darknet markets?  I think simple shopping cart modules and turnkey solutions for vendors is important.  If I actually had time and resources to dedicated to this I would spin some up!

Cool story bro, but do you live in your parents' basement or something?  I get it, bitcoin is money.  Yep.  I receive payments from customers in BTC and use it to pay my suppliers to replenish inventory.  Using bitcoin "full circle" is great for the currency.  Yay me!
But as a consumer, spending bitcoin on stuff is *exactly* the same thing as selling bitcoin to pay for stuff.  Instead of exchanging BTC for USD to in turn spend on rent, property tax, a cheeseburger, a steak dinner, your comcast bill, car insurance, homeowners insurance... you are selling BTC directly for rent, property tax, a cheeseburger, a steak dinner, your comcast bill, car insurance, homeowners insurance...

I'm not good at convincing anybody one way or another.  You're here asking this question, so I think you know what to do anyway.
I like owning a part of something that I feverishly believe in. I don't view it as an investment.  I think of it as fueling an idea that I hope catches on.
It is more than just owning a token.  I own stocks as well, but they serve no function.  Bitcoin is something that I *use*.
When I'm shopping online, I will always pay with bitcoin if it is an option (and re-buy spent BTC instantly).
If I am choosing between Amazon and Overstock I will always buy at Overstock and pay with bitcoin.
I have an online business.  I educate my customers on how to easily obtain and pay for their orders with BTC.  This spreads the good word and increases my bitcoin hodlings.
Being able to use bitcoin in this way gives me at least a tiny bit of control of bitcoin's success.

I toyed with trading, but I've never been good at it, bitcoin or otherwise.  It turns into a job that you need to put at least a few hours a day into.  I don't need/want a job.
Instead, I've focused on creating a stream of BTC revenue.  I've done much better this way rather than chasing highs and lows.  IMO just try to get paid in BTC and HODL.

I switched my website from Coinbase to Bitpay about a year ago.  I don't convert our BTC payments to fiat.  We HODL.  A month ago Bitpay told me they need more identification documents.  I was annoyed because we only use their service because it was an easy plugin for our Magento store.  I'm a coder by trade so I just whipped up a Blockchain.info payment module using their API.
Now... I don't like keeping BTC on Bitpay, Coinbase, or Blockchain.info.  Never have and never will.  I just transfer to a real wallet once a week.  Our BTC sales are less than 2% of our total sales volume anywhoo.  Hope you can use this info somehow and good luck.

I advise them not to.  It is too volatile and hard to secure for the average person.  That has been the hard truth since I got involved with BTC 5 years ago.  They end up buying anyway.  People don't like to be told to not do stuff.  I will say though; it has become a lot easier to secure with the new fangled hardware wallets.

Their revenue will be down, but their amount of bitcoin transactions will grow significantly due to it being the customers only option.  Trust me, I know from personal experience.  I had my merchant account pulled from me in September and my business went from about 1 or 2 bitcoin transactions a day to 30 or 40 per day.  Normally, we transact between 80 to 200 orders per day, so yes sales were low but we were still afloat.  Bitcoin was the customers only option and we have loyal customers.  Basically, bitcoin saved my family from a financial disaster.

Valid point.  Would the investors have time to sell their BTC?  Would the non-investors just liquidate their BTC for monero/zcash.  I think price of BTC would plummet, but the price of more anonymous crypto would sky rocket.  And the only onramp to monero/zcash is through BTC.  There would be people with monero/zcash speculating that the bank would be reversed just like the speculators buying up Gox Bux.  A ban wouldn't achieve their goal of complete and total capital control.  It would only cause a shift on how crypto is used.
This is all stuff we would talk about back in 2012.  The longer bitcoin increases in adoption with legitimate services though, the less likely it is to occur.

The average home has between $8,000 and $20,000 or more of wiring and lighting fixtures.  Then there are all the appliances.  Why are they risking it?  Their investment could all become useless?  Answer: the risk is so low they don't even care.

Well, yes.  Fees are assessed for using their services.  Typically, customers pay this fee indirectly through the cost of goods and services they are paying for.


Yes again.  Have you read Visa/Mastercard terms of service and regulations?  Huge fines are assessed against merchants for violating them.  Additionally, opting-out of accepting Visa/Mastercard payments would kill the companies that do so.
I do see your point though.  They are just a private business and should be allowed to do as they please as long as basic rights aren't being violated.  The problem is, they have intertwined with government in the form of a two headed monopoly.  If we had a true free market there would be healthy competition.  Because of this monopoly the merchants and card holders have nowhere else to turn... just like government.

I gave my kids 1BTC a few months ago.  They were ecstatic!  Of course they have been taught the principals of bitcoin and put up with listening to Dad ramble on about Cryptocurrency vs Fiat and his crazy libertarian beliefs for years and years, so they "get it".
I taught them some Bitcoin security basics. How to spend and receive and how to safely manage their wallet (mycelium) and to place their hand written backup seeds in two very safe and secure locations.
My 20 year old son spent about half of his BTC on Overstock.com to buy a new computer desk.  He just moved out to his first apartment and built his first gaming PC.
My 17 year old daughter says she checks her Mycelium wallet every day and just stares at her shiny bitcoin.  She likes to watch the price go up and down and said "it is like it is alive".  Now she is interested in the reasons why the market influences the value.  She reads some crypto news and I think she lurks here on now LOL
A part of this is a bit of estate planning.  Although I have a will, I can't be sure the lawyer will execute the BTC side of things precisely.  I'm a firm believer if you hold any quantity of BTC your successors should be taught how to use it.
So, it depends on who you are giving the BTC to as a gift!  My kids have been conditioned/educated to appreciate the value of bitcoin.  IMO If the person has ever expressed interest in bitcoin then they are a good candidate for a BTC gift.

That 2 to 5 day deposit is a provisional credit.  Your customers all have the ability to dispute every transaction and it is up to you to prove it was a legitimate charge.  They have typically up to 90 days to dispute/chargeback, but exceptions can be made up to 6 months later.  So no, that money you received isn't "yours" yet.

Seems like there is a better way to do things rather than treating exchanges like a "bank" (a dark unknown cave that we throw our money into and hope the ugly monster thing that lives inside there throws it back when we ask for it).
Since the blockchain is an open ledger and stuff why can't we see the \*exact status\* of the specific BTC we have on exchange.  They should provide a list of addresses they control and we should be able to easily see that the BTC we have on exchange is within their control and has not been sold.  Presto... accountability.
Also... maybe some sort of multisig "thingy" so that things don't move until a 3rd party verifies they should be moving.  And yes, I'm aware of DEX, that is the future but I'm imagining something between here and there.

So, are you waiting for the CEO of "Crypto Corp." to make a Steve Job's-esque presentation on their "product" that will answer all your cropto-needs?  I'm confused about which part of decentralized open source you don't understand.  Progress is chaotic and inefficient as a feature, not a bug.
Contributing to a project doesn't have to just involve lines of code.  Actually, by simply opting out and not using LN for example, you are still contributing towards overall progress by voting with your wallet per se.  Even constructive criticism of the current issues is healthy and productive, but petulantly bitching about the current state of BTC and/or LN as if the current capabilities is bitcoin in it's final form is ignorant and nothing but noise.
I have said it before, and I'll say it again... Bitcoin has been flooded with a bunch of technology consumers over the past year. They don't understand open source. They have never developed software. They just expect a CEO to make a grandiose keynote presentation unveiling Lightning Network as a complete and polished product for them to consume.  What they don't realize is we are still in the early adoption phase.

Putting individual coffee transactions on the most secure decentralized consensus based public ledger of truth secured by the most powerful purpose built supercomputer on earth is... overkill.


Lightning Network eventually.  Are people paying for coffee with Bcash right now?  Nope.  The average Bcash transaction fee is $0.12 cents.  Do you want to even pay $0.12 cents to pay for your coffee?  Nope.  Would the Bcash transaction fees get cheaper if people every started using it?  Nope.
If you don't like how LN isn't ready for mainstream, nut up and code.  Welcome to open source.  Stop being such a consumer sissy and start being a creator and contributor.  Otherwise, go buy some Ripple and try to buy some coffee with that ;)

My business uses BTCPay Server and it is absolutely excellent.
The whole idea of using Coinbase or Bitpay to accept payments is absolutely retarded IMO.  It is like using a "trusted" 3rd party to place cash in your cash register at your brick and mortar retails store.
BTCPay Server and it's ease of integration with existing ecommerce platform payment modules is the most underrated bitcoin project and contribution. 
Edited to add:  We will never have true decentralization if vendors can only choose between receiving payments through Coinbase or Bitpay.  Bitcoin is, after all, a peer to peer cash system.

My business has been accepting bitcoin since about 2012/2013.  The reason why has nothing to do with moon and lambos.  The banking industry is very restrictive in my industry selling specific legal herbal dietary supplements due to government overreach by the FDA.  Oh, we accept credit cards too but that involves a 10% rolling reserve and 8% transaction fees and receive payouts after 4 weeks because the banking industry deems us "high risk" even though we have almost zero chargebacks and transact a few million dollars a year.
I have been in the supplement industry since 2005 and as a business owner banking is my biggest challenge.  Bitcoin solves this problem.  Additionally, I use bitcoin "full-circle" and pay some of my largest invoices for wholesale suppliers in Indonesia and Malaysia with bitcoin.
Also, I'm a software engineer by trade.  The computer science experiment aspect of bitcoin are fascinating and exciting to me.
Additionally, I am a libertarian and the cypherpunk anarcho-capitalist roots of bitcoin agree with me.
So no, its not about moon and lambos for me, and many other people.  You don't have things as figured out as you think you do.

Competing currencies are good.
As segwit gains adoption and transaction fees stay low and lightning network goes mainstream and schnorr signatures are rolled out there will be very little reason for alts.  We will have instant transactions, privacy and fungibility, low fees, and decentralization backed by the most hashing power.
Alts will never go away, but I can see bitcoin regaining a large amount of market cap in the next 3 to 5 years.  Bitcoin has the largest concentration of development talent.  It is the largest "brain trust" in crypto. Additionally, bitcoin has the most mainstream adoption already.  It is the on-ramp for all but 3 or so alt coins.  ETFs have been repeatedly proposed.  A small amount of institutional money is already interested in bitcoin.  All of these points are not the case for the alts.

From a merchant's perspective, I *NEED* bitcoin.  Many moons ago, I had a small, but booming PC peripheral company that went from processing $100k/month to $700k/month in a short amount of time.  This was due to intelligent marketing strategy and aggressive partnerships with direct semiconductor importers.
So, what happened?  Our rapid growth threw up flags with First Data (which is the largest merchant processor) and they froze our merchant account with close to $200k of cash.  It turns out this stuff is pretty common in the realm of merchant accounts, but we were dead in the water for a few weeks while we negotiated a "deal" with them.  In this "deal" we put up an additional $300k of cash to hold in a reserve account.  With this $500k in reserve we should be good to go and we were back in the saddle.  Of course I was broke now and so was my partner/investor, but we had this fledgling successful business at the precipice of success.
You could say "get a different merchant account", but the fact is First Data processes for 80% of the merchant accounts out there, Nova is the other 20%.  You think Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Etc... offer "merchant accounts"?  They don't.  They just resell them.  It is practically a monopoly, so you would be effectively getting another merchant account processing through First Data again throwing up yet another red flag.
About half a year later, our sales grew yet again.  First Data then proceeded to, without warning, freeze our settlements to our bank account. Of course they kept taking sales transactions, but they simply weren't settling the funds to our bank.  By the end of the week our cash was depleted and they were holding yet another $200k for a total of $700 USD.
They wanted to renegotiate the "deal".
We went out of business.
Oh.  We got some money back after they picked it clean with "fees".
You can say "nobody needs bitcoin", but you are really saying you don't need bitcoin.  If Bitcoin was mainstream at that point in time my story would have been much different.  I wonder just how many innovations have been destroyed, businesses ruined, jobs lost because of our current payment system?

But accessibility to mortgages increases demand because otherwise unqualified buyers are now buyers.  Were you around during the Real Estate Crash?  All you needed for a mortgage was a pulse.  Sometimes even that was optional.  The bag boy at the supermarket was now a "real estate investor" and had 8 properties.
I agree though.  Inflation isn't the answer.  I also agree, price goes up because supply can't meet rising demand.
How many people would be buying houses this year if none of them could access a mortgage?  What would happen to the median real estate prices?

Seriously though, have you done bitcoind API integration with Magento?  I'm a programmer, but also have a thriving business to run.  I don't have time to play with code these days.  Very few developers I have thrown money at on freelancer.com know crap about bitcoind.

I disagree.  Mortgages make home "ownership" more achievable for people.  This creates more buyers than there would be without mortgages.  More buyers means higher home prices because econ 101.

Which all are manipulated by central banks that parasitically extract wealth from the holders of those currencies.  These currencies all require middlemen to conduct transactions which take fees and more importantly decide who is allowed and who isn't allowed to conduct transactions.  Do you think it was easy for the citizens of Cyprus to "just change currency" when theirs was failing due to corrupt central banking policy?  Zimbabwe?  How about Venezuela currently?  How about the current 2 billion unbanked?  Can they just easily choose one of these "competing" currencies?  No.  They can't.

There are many things stopping supply from simply increasing to meet demand for houses.  For example; urban sprawl.  Limitation in functional development of cities.  I lived in Miami for about 7 years.  Yeah they built a ton of houses in 2004.  But all of them were a 2 hour commute to where the jobs were.  Nobody wants a 2 hour commute.
Here is another example; I now live on an island.  Although we are a small community, there is a physical limit to how much land there physically is.  With a few exceptions, all of the lots have been developed.
I suppose people can live to rural Wyoming, but there is less demand to live there because some aspects of living there are undesirable.  Less jobs, for example.
There are many, many other contributing factors.

So what you're saying is... the most widely accepted decentralized peer to peer electronic cash system secured by the most powerful supercomputer in the world that allows anybody to transact across borders with zero censorship isn't worth $2,100?
I'm going to make a comparison which I admit isn't apples to apples (hah... pun not intended).  But since digital assets are a new thing there is no fair comparison.  For me, though, it puts things in perspective as to what BTC is worth:
The market cap of Apple Computer ($809 billion) is 24 times more than the market cap of Bitcoin ($33 billion).  Shares of Apple Computer offer me absolutely no utility.  There is no use case besides speculation.  More shares of Apple Computer can be issued which obviously dilutes existing shares.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, accounts for about 10% of my online business sales, so I can receive payments for my products with it with less hassle and issues than using banks.  Bitcoin's supply is finite.  It's value deflationary over time.  I can send BTC to my friends or family across the country or overseas relatively immediately and I don't need permission from any government or bank to do so.  I find that much more valuable than shares in Apple Computer.
I have seen bitcoin boom and bust.  It will continue to do both.  But this time it feels like it is correcting upward.  I could be wrong though.  It has happened before. :)
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:24:59
Yeah I use Electrum too. Also Mycelium.  Also Jaxx.  Also a few Trezors.  Thanks for the tip though.
I use blockchain.info for a reason though.  With the exception of Mycelium, the other wallets don't have APIs to interface with my ecommerce website and receive payments directly from customers.  Blockchain.info does.
Come to think of it... for an internet currency, there sure are very few easy ways to integrate bitcoin payments into my internet store.  Silly.
But back to my thought...  My understanding is that blockchain.info has quite a few wallets.  Quite a few people use them and stuff.    So what is the overall user experience for these users?  And how does this affect bitcoin?
If blockchain.info is run by "big blockers" then they could easily influence their users perception on how critical our current scaling issue is by simply having crappy fee estimation.  Hmmmmmm...

IMO people are fearful of Satoshi's stash starting to move.  Those coins have been assumed to be lost and this has been baked-in to the price of bitcoin.  The movement of those coins means very rapid inflation.  Additionally, if the creator of bitcoin is some con artist freak then it will cause additional negative public sentiment for bitcoin, causing the price to fall.  The best case scenario for bitcoin is that Satoshi is *never* revealed.

But you are missing the point. I'm not saying "don't buy AAPL, buy bitcoin! Derp derp derp!" I'm saying... I like Apple, but what does AAPL bring to the planet? iThings? A tablet to update your Instagram with? A watch that is a computer? Yes, Apple has impacted the world, but did they create TCP/IP? Did they invent the internet? No. But that is how significant of an impact bitcoin can have on the world! And how can we quantify the value of that?

Above 50mil is where people tend to own the jet outright.  A Gulfstar G650 costs about 65mil.  A Cessna Citation Mustang is about 2.5mil.

I avoid getting anybody into BTC.  I love talking about it and I'm pretty passionate about it, but I clearly tell them I do not recommend they buy bitcoin.  It is an experiment.  It is volatile.
First, I don't want bitcoin to sound like a scam.  When you are trying to convince people to do something financially, it is usually a scam.  See; onecoin.
Second, I'd feel bad if they go apeface all-in and bitcoin crashes and they lose everything.  Sure, they are responsible for themselves, but I'd still feel bad.  And if they are a friend or family I wouldn't want that event to come between us.

People keep saying this.  How can it be true?
* Lightning Network will reduce the number of on-chain transactions.  Right?
* Reduced number of on-chain transactions result in lower fees per transaction.  Right?
If we had Lightning right now (I wish) and I needed to send you BTC on a regular basis for the next few months, we could:
1.) Open a LN channel and transact that way, only paying transaction fees to open and close the channel.  (Cheapest, fastest, less convenient)
2.) Transact completely on-chain and pay fees every time I send you BTC. (More expensive, slower, more convenient)
The decision between the two methods is a competition. Which is faster, which is cheaper, which is more convenient?  It depends on the use case.

I used to agree.  But what products will there be a demand for that require gold after a huge economic collapse?    Seems that jewelry, electronics, and teeth is the main industry.  Teeth are important.
Again, don't get me wrong.  Diversification is important.  IMO gold has some value.  Bitcoin has some value.  I just feel that gold is sold to old fat wealthy guys that have little or no sustenance living skills because they spent their entire life pushing a pen.  When the economy fails people that can fix things, build shelter, hunt, and provide will be important.  Barter of skills and goods would become the norm.  The old wealthy guy with soft hands goes to the bottom of the food chain.  The idea that gold will save them in that scenario gives some people comfort.

Well, the Internet (then ARPANET) adopted TCP/IP in 1983.  I think of BTC as TCP/IP.  It wasn't until the "killer app" called the World Wide Web was created in 1990 that the Internet as we know it existed though.
The whole "bitcoin is like the internet in 1996" thing is phrased in a way that most people can relate to since pre 1996 most people couldn't imagine such a thing could exist.  Mass adoption started around 1994/1995 when Netscape Navigator was released.

We sell a dietary supplement that specifically is hard to get credit card processing for.  Each Visa transaction costs us more than 11%, so we have really been pushing our customers to learn how to pay with bitcoin.  We incentivize BTC payments with a constant 10% discount and sometimes do a week long 20% bitcoin discount promotion.  The 20% promos gets a lot of interest, but even with all of this our bitcoin sales account for less than 7% of our total gross sales.  Baby steps.

Payments for invoices to vendors in SE Asia.  Used to be wire transfer, but talked my suppliers into BTC to make the full circle (receive payments from customers in BTC and pay for inventory in BTC).
Also, I'm sitting on my couch paid for in BTC (dubbed the "Bitcouch") that I bought on Overstock.
Also, some legal hemp oil and other supplement products.
Also, the occasional hotel room through Expedia while traveling.

Do you need to declare your bank account balances now?  You are traveling with debit cards.  See... the dumb legislators think BTC is physically on your phone/trezor/wallet.  They are not.  Just like money isn't physically in your Visa/Mastercard debit card.

I agree.  Hopefully we get through the ugly stuff real quick here.  I'll be concerned when ETH hash rate starts approaching BTC hash rate.

What value...  Are you a business owner?  I can't even begin to describe the value I see in bitcoin.  And I won't bother to go into the details because I would have to give my life story.  I will just say that I have been an entrepreneur since 1997, but have experienced so many challenges with banking and payment processing that I no longer have the blind faith in banks that you have.  If it wasn't for bitcoin saving my business in September of last year I would be financially ruined and one of my businesses defunct.  Thanks to bitcoin I am not.  So, yeah bitcoin has value to me.  :)
I see you have plenty of faith in our legislators too.  I remember when I did too.  Ignorance is bliss.  Enjoy.

If people are selling their BTC because of this news they only bought BTC to make a quick buck in the first place.  To me, the value bitcoin is worth more than how many dollars I can buy with one.  Personally, I find it unnacceptable to have to "prove" I am not a criminal every time I return to the USA and clear customs.  Do you even travel often?
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:50:47
What makes you think bitcoin won't eventually scale?  Do you really thing segwit and/or other solutions won't ever occur?  Decentralization is inefficient and ugly.  It is a process.

Yep.  And the bill will make you and I criminals.  The USA loves criminals.  We have more criminals per capita than any other country on Earth.  That is what happens when you make everything a crime.  Like traveling with access to more than $10k of ones and zeros.

Unlikely.  Something else must be going on with your account or transactions.  Try contacting bitpay via email or phone.

I totally agree with this.  My ecommerce business accepts BTC.  The average customer demographic is about 40 - 50 year old women and we constantly educating new customers on how to use bitcoin.  The  usability problem we have constantly encountered is underpayment.  It took forever to figure out why some customers were underpaying by only a few satoshis.  Their order would remain on hold and it would create a horrible user experience.  Many customers said they would never use bitcoin again after having their order delayed for a day or two until our customer service has to manually push their order through.  This also costs us money in the form of CSR hours.
We ended up modifying our callback to allow for a slight margin of error and accept/process the order if it is a fraction of a percent less than the required payment amount.  This has cut back on 90% of the bitcoin related support issues.
As far as bitcoin has come, we are not there yet.  It needs a bit more time and innovation in the user interface realm for mass adoption to occur.  Remember... we are geeks in an echo chamber, but easy to see when you deal with the usability issues out there in the wild.

One vendor in Indonesia was very easy.  They had heard of bitcoin, but thought it was something like PayPal.
Two other vendors were hard to convince.  One of the vendors is in Malaysia and there wasn't a convenient exchange for them to convert to Malaysian Ringgit at the time.  They need to pay their bills/taxes after all.  I'm not sure where they are exchanging BTC, but apparently they found an exchange.
The other "hard to convince vendor" was stuck on the idea of wire transfers since that is what they know.  The owner of the company seemed very wary of bitcoin in general.  Every time I ordered I asked if they would take bitcoin.  They eventually came around when I nicely pointed out I might give the business to my other vendors since I prefer to pay with BTC and they accept it.  Eventually they came around once we agreed to start with 50% wire/50% BTC payments on the first few orders.
BTW: I noticed nobody cares about decentralization or the technology behind bitcoin.  All they want is sound money since their livelihood depends on it.
