Yeah the difference is I bought LTC at the beginning of the year whereas I just bought BTC yesterday, just in time for this fun ride all the way down... haha

Just nervous and excited all at the same time! I plan on HODLing ;)

What about altcoins? I have some money in LTC, wondering where else I might put some cash in to diversify especially as BTC bleeds (for now) :)

I'm sure this has been debated elsewhere... but can someone humor me? 
Much of the complexity of Lightning comes from having to shoe-horn it in as a softfork to the 10 year old live $300B bitcoin network.  This feat of cryptography and engineering was originally thought to be impossible, and many are still skeptical.  
I take it that most of you on this thread are not... skeptical?

More or less. So much more volatile than my LTC experience so far. Gotta breathe

It's giving me lots of anxiety that underlying blockchain infrastructures are so limited and fragile still (cryptokitties jamming the ethereum network, any surge in txs clogging bitcoin and zcash), yet so much is being built on them and they're gaining traction so fast. It's hard to imagine building skyscrapers when you're worrying about fortifying the foundations. Progress on infrastructure is slow, and not enough people are working on it or know what they are doing.
All that being said ... I'm interested in using radio to for btc tx. Szabo recently had a proof of concept of a tx over HF but I think something even more practical is goTenna ( -- ready to go, open SDK, and has better propagation &amp; bandwidth. Totally P2P off-grid mesh network with SMS backhaul out of the box and lots of nodes all over the place already: 
EDIT/ADD: Why do you think BTC will stabilize at 14-17K?

Crypto zen. I needed that, thank you &lt;3

I bought at $15,717. SIGH, so like me to buy at peak like a clown :( ( (

thanks i felt smarter just reading your post :)

Why do you like Gemini more than Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:24:01
Hi, in the same boat as you guys. I got in at $15,717. I thought I was being smart, and well... I guess let's just give it some more time. Coinbase is locking up my funds anyway for 8 days lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:08:55
I finally bit the bullet and bought $5K at $15,717. 
I thought I was being sneaky going in as it dropped for a bit, and it's just kept dropping. Sigh... I also didn't realize (as I'd only done debit/credit before) that if I used my bank to buy it won't even be in my Coinbase wallet for 8 days. And now Coinbase is saying transactions are delayed by up to 5 days over that. So I can't even sell til then... 
Anyone have any wisdom/therapy to share? ;)

Yes, yes, indeed.
