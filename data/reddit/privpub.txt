No, even prior to settlement. A LN (or payment channel tx) has the same level of finality, if not more actually, as a regular bitcoin tx.
I say more because to double-pend a zero-conf LN tx you would need signatures from both parties, so that is unlikely to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:32:08
I see. I'm just trying to gauge whether LN is actually a viable option for coffee payments and online shopping (individual use), or whether it will mainly enable M2M and B2B payments.

It is not about decentralisation, the network is plenty decentralised as it is. It is about *trustlessness*. Running your own node, and basing your economic activity on it, eliminates trust in others.
S2X did not fail "because the network was so decentralised", it failed because the *economic majority* refused to accept it.

Actually, Lightning will make IOTA obsolete. Lighting was primarily envisioned to be both a scaling solution and allow for micro-payments, the latter is what we need for machine-to-machine payments - but without each IOT device having to do their own POW.

@_date: 2017-12-23 15:24:55
So *simple* users will be able to make incidental payments through Lightning as long as a) they are connected to LN through a payment channel, b) the receiver is online, and c) there is a route of online intermediaries from payer to payee available?
Whether the user uses a hardware wallet or mobile wallet should not matter in this scenario right?

Lightning and [other optimisations](


If Bitcoin's security was free it would not be very good. The only issue here is that miners should go renewable.


Correct fee management and, again, Lightning.


Constantly improving. Vastly better than what was available four years ago. Dare dreaming of a future where every phone has a hardware wallet built-in.


Entirely not Bitcoin's fault and very fixable - if only existing monetary infrastructure would cooperate.


*The modern era of banking* that is envisioned by Bitcoin proponents is so vastly different from the current system that it does not include banks. You seem to have missed the point here. Your statement is similar to saying "labourers would be the first to be all over automation", or "oil companies would be the first to be all over renewable". **IF** everyone used Bitcoin, I would not need a bank for anything. They literally **cannot** participate in this.


This is hyperbole and a weak ending to an otherwise good rebuttal. Why would you end with a bunch of cheap shots that are only a result of the technology's infancy? Clearly, Bitcoin is not there yet. Again, dare to look ahead.
You seem to be knowledgeable on the areas that you covered, but lack technical depth to appreciate Bitcoin's marvel from a geek perspective - or to be able to reason about its future. If anything you come across as a little bitter, rather than trying to give a neutral and factual response.
Don't mistake this comment in any way for agreement with the OP.

It comes down to optimisation, making it so that less space is required for each tx = more txs in a block = less fee pressure.
* Signature aggregation
* Lightning
* MAST
* And *I think* Bulletproofs (aggregatable range proofs) as well, but I haven't quite read up on that.
All of these have a direct impact on the issues you mentioned.

Really? An entire post about Bitcoin's strength being that it didn't ask for permission and to this day does not require permission from anyone, and you go on to say this? "*There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to improve the financial system, just go ask the relevant authorities in your jurisdiction for permission before you launch your decentralised peer-to-peer cryptocurrency!*". 
That is not the mentality Bitcoin was built on. Bitcoin is as much about permissionlessness as it is about trustlessness. It is the power of crypto that we can start things that don't fit within the rules of the current system.
There are many "negative" effects to bitcoin. The abundance of online drug markets (and worse) due to the ease of anonymous online payments. Ransomware, which became a very viable business model because of bitcoin. And Ransomware affects *innocent* people, not people gambling their money away in ICO's. I would consider the latter willing participants to a dangerous game.




We don't know who "Satoshi Nakamoto" is, so we also don't know who **is not** "Satoshi Nakamoto". It could be any developer that jumped on board early on, and mined bitcoins. That person would still have made a killing and to this day stands to gain most by continuing development on bitcoin.
Bitcoin is great, but let's not idolise "Satoshi Nakamoto" or what bitcoin stands for to such an extreme extend.
Edit: Let's stick to what we know, and praise "Satoshi Nakamoto" for inventing Bitcoin. There are many unknowns beyond that.

I, too, think "an airplane should be able to fly or we can not call it an airplane" is purely personal opinion. It's a shame so many of you swing amiss in this area. Decentralisation, trustlessness, and immutability are the whole point of Bitcoin. You give up immutability, means you give up decentralisation (as there is now some party that can make a decision about the chain) and trustlessness (as you now have to trust others not to mess with the transaction history).
If it is your opinion that you don't want or need these properties, that is fine, but don't use a blockchain then. Use a database and make some promises of "we promise not to" to your users. And especially, don't market your shit as one, or pretend you are even in the same game as Bitcoin is.
