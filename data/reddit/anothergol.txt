Really? And how does it work, when ONLY pros are in the market, and they ALL make money?
Money flows from the hands of the noobs to the hands of the pro's. Now remove noobs from the equation?
And if you're saying that the next step is "pro", then that's the biggest reason for me to sell. That should be the reason for pretty much everyone to sell.
What about the .com bubble btw? Why did it take Nasdaq 16 years to JUST recover? And are you saying that institutions are gonna be allowed to pursue the bubble, while everyone knows how it's gonna end? And not just that, you can't seriously have pro's trading on this market so unregulated, and working 24h/day.
And it's worse here, because crypto aren't nearly as important as the internet. Especially BTC which is "just" a value, thus is purely based on trust. I can see some ALTs getting success, though.

Hi there, remember me? I hate to be right (because my money is still on it), but so far it has been behaving pretty much as I wrote, no?
Hit 12k.. while marketcap didn't increase.. people realize no new blood was buying.. down again. 
I don't think this has any chance to reach 20k again without something to put BTC in the (positive) news again.

It's not gonna go very far if you limit it to the few "people who believe in this technology".

But wait, we're talking about BTC here. It's over for BTC, but there are things that will either end up being useful, or businesses that will generate money (decentralized casinos, etc) and have buy-back plans.
It's just over for BTC, &amp; thus for now, everything else, due to the way ALTs are valued.
But if you still believe in BTC, buy the dip, and we'll talk about it again in a few months. You'd better be confident.
Personally, I've sold enough BTC's to get my initial investment back. I haven't touched my ALTs &amp; bought some more (even though it's stupid during a BTC dip, but still). Kept some BTCs, because they may be still worth what I paid for them in a couple of years. But it's just never be worth the 100k's people were dreaming of.

Exactly my thought. This isn't like the last Chinese-ban crash that quickly recovered, it was only about the Chinese coming back from the backdoor. 
This is the chance BTC needed, and it blew it up. It has just disgusted a lot of newcomers, those who sold at a loss will never touch it again. Those who held, will most likely take their money back if it gets up, and will never touch it again. Who else is gonna buy? Not veteran investors, they just did now, or are waiting for more dip, none of them is gonna buy above 12k. I don't see who else.. not for quite some time until things get forgotten.
The incentives aren't even there anymore. "Bitcoin futures" are gonna pump prices so much. Sure the expectations pumped it a lot, but then everyone realized it wouldn't do anything.

"Parabolic rises ie volatility is EXACTLY what makes them money."
So isn't that also how they LOSE money? If not, WHO loses the money? For how long do parabolic rise run, and which ones never dumped?
@_date: 2018-03-10 05:58:31
That's the reason (read: little spark needed) for the mini-crash, NOT the total crypto marketcap that just isn't moving anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:29:50
But why would institutions touch something THIS volatile?
And how would institutions rise the BTC back to 20k in less than YEARS? This crazy ride NEEDED hairdressers, because they are idiots who blindly put money regardless of the price. Pro's don't create parabolic rises, at least not if they know there are no hairdressers to follow, to later dump on them. Pro's buy the dips (&amp; even there, they are idiots when they buy dips that dip way deeper), &amp; invest wisely. 
Sure it wouldn't require THAT much money to pump it back to 20k, order books have emptied enough, but once past 12k, pro's wouldn't risk money in it anymore. You need hairdressers for that, and here even if you pump it back to 20k, you will only count on the hairdressers who haven't already sold at a big loss. Perhaps the few who held will bring a couple more hairdressers to the market, but it won't be the same again, it's gonna take quite some time. Crypto-craze v2 in a year or 2 maybe? I'd say when the concepts have started to become apps, and that some apps have started to be useful, or even profitable.

Ok, pros made it dip &amp; scooped, now what? Who's gonna buy it upwards again? Another hairdresser? Why? Pros won't buy above 12k, you need those hairdressers for that, where are they gonna come from, this time?
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:10:49
I'm not quite sure Robinhood is now gonna get the success everyone predicted, though. Those who you think will buy BTC through it, could as well have made it through Coinbase. Same kind of easy entry.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:50:39
So it held a little at 8k and you already think it's over? 
In many places I wrote it's probably gonna go up to 10-12k again. It's at that price that I can't see who's still gonna buy.
If it really touches 20k again, then yeah you can brag about being right.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:42:49
The same people? You mean the few who sold above 15k and now can afford buying using their profit? Yeah, but not many of them. 
Those who held, or those who sold at a loss, do you think they are gonna lose MORE money in this?
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:31:29
Yeah, but all those who were ready to, just did. I mean, pretty much everyone heard of Bitcoin during the last 2 months. The 99.85% who haven't invested because they found it too risky, are certainly not gonna start now. 
Those who were waiting for a cheaper price, just bought (or are still waiting), they won't buy at 12k. Only dollar-cost-averagers will buy above 12k, and it's gonna be very slow. But if something as risky as BTC only moves upwards very slowly, what's the point in staying in it? 
(not counting that when the Tether shit will hit the fan [and who knows when it will happen?], it's gonna be another bloodbath)

The problem is, to get back to 19k, you need the bunch of newcomers who pumped the price to 19k in the first place. But where are you gonna find them now? Do you expect them to come back? Sure, maybe in a year when they will have forgotten. But right now? The weak hands sold at a loss, they will never touch BTC again, let alone buy near the top. The newcomers who held? They won't buy AGAIN, rather they will sell to get their money back. Old-time investors like you? Nope, you only buy dips, you won't buy high. So, *who* is gonna buy BTC when it will go above, say 12k?
BTC got its moment of fame. It won't necessarily happen twice.
