What's the difference between 'confirmed' and what CPFP covers?
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:27:52
Ok! Cool! How is this done?  Just by doubling the fee?

Is it possible to contact miners (directly?) on GDax?
I'm new to crypto your assistance is greatly appreciated!!

Ok, so if I've got it confirmed (6 confirmations), assuming I've added enough money for fees, at that point how can I use CPFP to sell it on GDax?

I'd like to purchase BTC in a separate exchange, and then sell it on GDax (ie dump it on the market in exchange for USD) while it is still in transit to me.
I'd like to use the proof of ownership and a change of delivery address as collateral.

I thought that's what CPFP was?  That the block chain had 'confirmed' it was yours even though it was still in transit to you, at which point you can sell it (and just change the address to have it delivered)

Ok, So then what did you mean by 'even if you use CPFP you still have to wait for it to confirm'?

Is it possible to contact a miner on GDax?

The S&amp;P can be traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  Smh.
You guys are hilarious

Hey, thanks for your feedback.
I don't really mind the clowns; a little surprised there's so many, but then again that's the internet for you.
The long and short of it is that the group I'm working WITH, not for, is new to crypto.  Admittedly.  Before we'd/they'd mainly been trading on the S&amp;P.  In any event, we've been collectively getting a lot of 'thats impossible because xyz's, but the same has been said of other ventures in the past, and we've pushed past those perceived limitations.  So really, we're just sifting through to find the few who have pulled it off.
I know for a fact that it's possible because I know of a couple groups who are doing it.  We believe they're working with their own collection of miners.
The money is there if need be, but not for scammers etc.  Which is why we've primarily been reaching out to people in our networks.  I'm on here as well because you never know.  But there'd have to be some verification before we could move forward.
In any event, like I said, new to it, yes.  Money available, yes.  But there's a fair amount of dialogue that would need to happen in between.  So I hope anyone serious can find their way past the naysayers (and clowns) in the comments, because I started this post specifically with "speak to a miner" for a reason.
Not looking for advice.
No diss, I welcome all the comments from those attempting to be helpful, but I'd respectfully ask only those who've got the ability &amp; know how/willing to work towards solutions to reply.
