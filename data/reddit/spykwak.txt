How safe is it to sign a message constructed by a 3rd party with a public key?
My Setup = Electrum 3.3.8 + Ledger Nano S.
(Electrum downloaded from [electrum.org](
Context: In order to claim another coin airdrop, it is required to sign a message constructed by a website to prove ownership of a public key containing a non-zero amount of BTC.
Contructed message provided by the tirdh party + Public key provided by me =&gt; Signed message output provided by Electrum
\- Private keys never leave the ledger
\- The messages displayed on the ledger are corrects).
Could the tirdh party use the signed message in order to sweep the BTC from my wallet?
I've been searching around and it seems that the signing message feature from Eletrucm wallet should not be able to sign a unsigned transaction from my wallet to a wallet of an attacker. Or am I wrong?

Beside a scenario we’re immutability, trustlessness / tamperproof / public ledger would be a desirable trait of a database I don’t see the application.
I have heard of application in the traceability of food supply chain. In that scenario, there is some application, but then there is no need for a super high hash rate to be sure of the safety of the data as you could do something like not allow a deep reorg of a few block and you’ll be pretty safe.

That is very recent then, I’ve configured a ledger a couple of week ago and I had to use a chrome apps to be able to setup a legacy wallet.

- setup a legacy wallet.
- send some funds to it.

It’s not punishment, it’s a learning curve.
But I think it is shitty because paying 1s/b is just normal to me. But for exemple ledger live doesn’t allow me to pay what i want so I have to use Electrum in conjunction with my Ledger then I can use the advanced mode to set a fee of 1s/b and it sometimes confirm within a couple of block. And it always confirm eventually if I wasn’t in a hurry anyway. I never had to use RBF or CPFP.
I’m starting to think that some wallet developper have common interest with mining operation and the fee estimation is out of wack.
If you look at a tool such as  you can see that the mempool can be around 1-2vMb and people will still overpay and get their transaction included in the same block as someone paying 1s/b.

We are nowhere near the same sentiment. At the beginning of the year everyone was shitting on BTC and everyone was loosing it about having lost so much money the whole of 2018.
That was the perfect time to buy in when market sentiment was in the gutter.
Now BTC has appreciated +-4x since that point and everyone is super bullish like you. Everyone is a genius trader during a bull run.
You are late to the party and just bought in out of FOMO and you are afraid of a retrace from this whole FOMO thing.
Only invest what you are ok to loose, no one can predict what BTC will do next. It could go to a new ATH as well as it could go down to 5k

Long term view,
Want to still have skin in the game because I could sell at a profit right now but I don’t want to have no skin in the game for when it would be worth more in 1-5years.
You don’t have itchy finger as well when you don’t have too much invested in BTC. If you have bills to pay, taking profit make sense. If you believe it will be worth more in the future, HODLing still make sense if you don’t want to daytrade a bear market.

Go to the adress tab and select a specific adress you have enough BTC on and right click and select “send from”.
You can also make a transaction from The adress containing dust into a single adress were you consolidate all utxo. Do consolidate at 1sat/b when you have time ahead, the transaction will get confirmed eventually (pretty quickly anyway, don’t use the proposed fee it’s of no use anyway)

The capability to run the 51% attack is there multiple time over. The financial incentive isn’t there because BCH is worthless 
@_date: 2018-09-12 05:44:01
I understand the outcome of a double spending attack through a &gt;51% attack isn’t a automatic guarantee. It’s a bet you’ll be a le to write a longest chain with the most proof of work rewriting out your expense. The exchange might lock your funds before you can flee with them.
Shorting is also a bet on future market reaction. You would have to take a bet with a huge leverage to be able to pay the expenses  of a double spending attack if you didn’t actually double spend a significant amount of it.
You would have to actually perform a double spend attack to provoke a significant crash of BCH for your shorting strategy to actually work.
Also, with a huge short placed on BCH you’ll might also get liquidated if you don’t have enough collateral to absorb an unexpected upward movement of the currency.
Now, I don’t know how many simulation you ran on this scenario. I haven’t ran any because there are so many ways it would go wrong (or right since a 51% isn’t a good thing to do). It’s essentially an elaborated bet with huge risk/reward. I won’t bet too much money on it if the sole goal is to discredit BCH and not actually make money out of it.

Not really, the lower the valuation the less profitable would a double spending attack be. (Assuming the nethash stays the same)
If the 51% attack isn’t incentivized why would someone spend money to do so. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 06:56:04
Beside a data structure (chain, tree) Blockchain is just a buzzword IMO, have to look at the entire ecosystem of a decentralized cryptocurrency to make any decision on how really trustless that particular cryptocurrency really is on a protocol level, how secure the network is so nobody can just write another longer chain.
+ a immutable blockchain is pretty useless in the context of many data intensive application.

You realize you’ll have to double spend a bigger BCH stack to get back the cost of running your 51% attack? Liquidating such a stack will crash the price to nothing and you won’t get the value needed to finance the attack out of the exchange soon enough.

During the weekend the bank cannot proceed a SEPA payement to an exchange like Coinbase. So buying volume is drying up as the weekend goes by. (That’s my case personnally, if I didn’t funded my EUR account prior to the weekend I’m SOL if the price drop and i don’t have liquidity to buy).
Also, as the month progress, people that get pay monthly are running out of money so they are less likely to have liquidity at the end of the month. In my case I get paid once a month at the end of the month.
Combine that with a downtrend, meaning that the limit sell order are not being closed. So no source of liquidity from the market.
With all of this, the normal people have less chance to have liquidity to scoop up the “cheap coins”.

The difficulty adjust to assure that no matter how much is the nethash the block time will always converge to 10 minutes per block.
If the nethash is higher, the difficulty goes higher to avoid faster than 10 minutes per block.
If the nethash is lower, the difficulty goes lower to avoid slower than 10 minutes per block.
It has nothing to do to the amount of block already mined.
If there is still financial incentive to add up to the nethash, you'll continue to see a rise of nethash and thus difficulty. If there is less financial incentive to add up to the nehash, the less profitable miner will quit the network. The difficulty will go down.
As long as the value of newly minted bitcoin + value of the transaction fee that could fit in each new block is above the value of the cost of running a mining operation the network will continue growing.
Inversely, if the value of newly minted bitcoin + value of the transaction fee doesn't cover the expense, the less profitable mining operations will leave the network untill the difficulty adjust lower to an equilibrium.
Let's say right before the next halving with the tech available, the value of newly minted BTC (12.5) + fee is just covering the expense of mining:
All other things being equal (efficiency, cost of electricity, nethash) once the block reward halve:
\- Half of the nethash has to leave,
\- The new tech need to be twice as efficient,
\- The reward BTC (6.75 + fee) has to cover the expenses: Thus, the fee has to go up, or the value of BTC has to go up =&gt; the miner cannot impose the price of either has the network continue to carry out. It's a competition between them and only the most efficient will keep on hashing away.
or a combinaison of those factors.
​Assuming the decrease of nethash is gradually decreasing, BTC could network could be supported by 2 PC running SHA-256 on a 486-DX4 while not pressing the turbo button. But in that case, the value of BTC will go down to next to nothing because the security level will be crap. If a large part of the network would leave at the same time, the block time will get so enormous that the blockchain confirmation will get to a halt, hopefully LN will carry-on untill the difficulty readjust after 2016 blocks. But t that’ll be catastrophic
One could argue that the maximum value BTC could reach is the cost of running the most efficient tech, at the least expensive electricity rate possible, at the least cost of labor for the maintenance of said tech, and the maximum luck (maximum centralisation sorry). Not some logarithmic bullshit we see sometimes as prediction.
1) BTC goes up AND difficulty keeps on going up, it means there is still some margin of profit for the miner, so it means that BTC is over-evaluated. 
2) BTC goes up AND difficulty stabilise it means we’re at an equilibrium and the price is right.
3) If difficulty goes down because BTC goes down in regards of current difficulty. It means that BTC is under-evaluated and miners cannot cover the cost of securing the network.

Crypto currency != Stock.
A Shareholder can evaluate the value of a stock based on the yearly/quarterly earnings publication VS the competing situation, insider information (illegal but commonplace - citation needed)
With crypto, such speculations are even harder, how would you know you overbought a given crypto? How much did the circulating supply really costed to mine from genesis block up to now? How much the new block reward cost today? What electricity price and salary do you take into account: Chinese/Icelandic/... (still mining with a good margin) or European one (mining at a loss)? If a more efficient miner comes out, will BTC go down in price or up?
Also, do you think the price is going to go down from here? Will cryptocurrencies really take off in mainstream use or stay a niche project?

Yes, then BTC would be cheap again if the network is scaling down?
People are talking about moon and 0. Why wouln'd BTC plateau to a range of certain range of value at which only some miners are able to mine profitably (thus making it kinda centralized).
The network is not stabilized yet, but I firmly believe that the oscilation will get smaller and smaller as time goes by. If it doesn't and continue to be as volatile as it is right now within 100 years, I don't think the project would have succeeded.
Stop speculating, start using (buy and replenish if you're not comfortable thinking it'll moon in the future)

1) If the maximum amount of token mined is 21M and the last token to be mined cost 1M Euro.
Why would the first 10M token that were mined for next to nothings be worth as much as the cost of the last token?
2) You forgot that mining a new block is also worth the transaction cost that you can charge. By 2140 the Tx cost might be worth a small fortune as well and the new coins rewarded for mining the new block will be insignificant.
3) By 2014, what would be the difficulty of the network? The hashrate could very well plateau to a hashrate deemed sufficiently safe every now and then.
4) What would be the efficiency of the new mining hardware?
5) what would be the cost of electricity by then? Maybe we would be able to harverst the energy of the sun and store it efficiently thus greatly decreasing the cost of energy.
We can't predict the growth of the network and the price of BTC in the next hours of the next week ... How do you think you can predict the growth of the BTC network by 2140?
There is also the possibility that by 2140 BTC hasn't been used to buy anything and would stay a speculation medium ... Stop speculating, start using !

1. the mathematical task is the same and agreed upon by all participants.SHA256 in the case of bitcoin, it’s pretty easy to calculate but the input is both depending of the previous block (so nobody has a headstart on anyone) and a nonce value you should find within a certain range of value determined by the present difficulty of the network (so the issuance of the crypto is not faster or slower than the 10 minutes per block target).
The nonce cannot be calculated, it has to be guessed, so the only way is to test a bunch of different values until you (your pool) find a correct nonce that give a correct hash. That’s the difficult part because every participant is competing to find it in an arm race to the most powerful network of computer.
If you (your pool) are the first to find it and it gets broadcasted to the node of network responsible of the accounting of the ledger. They’ll award you BTC for the block reward and you’ll (your pool) get some more BTC by picking up the most profitable transaction from the mempool to include in the next block
2. See difficulty condition on the validity of the nonce you can find.
3. You could, it’s a open source software, but you have to convince a majority of people running the Bitcoin client on their node tu upgrade it to your version. If you don’t get a majority of node agreeing to your change of protocol then not.
if you don’t agree on the current project and still want a non capped crypto currency, you can start a contentious branch of BTC but it won’t be the BTC with the consensus (Longest chain with the most PoW)

Well there is always a spread between potential buyer and seller *before* a transaction occur. At the time of the transaction the market price will be updated. Then there will be a new spread between potential buyer and seller.
Let's say there is a willing buyer at x and a willing buyer at x-10
no transaction is being made because they don't agree on the price.
A buyer has to buy at the price of the seller.
Or a seller has to agree on the price of the buyer.

the difficulty can retarget to a lower value. Thus mining would still be profitable for those who decide to continue after some miner shutdown their rig.
Bitcoin could still work by scaling down the infrastructure. The value of Bitcoin could very well decrease though if most of the available hashrate is offline able to 51% the network and double spend an exchange. (We're far from this possibility but who knows, we're talking about 2140 here)

I'm going to help you still but you have to do the rest yourself:
1\) calculate the amount of BTC you have: \(for this you have to use **\+** \)
\- make the **sum** of all your open sell position or look up the amount of BTC in your account.
2\) calculate the amount of Fiat you still have on that exchange if any: \(for this you have to use **\+** \)
\- make the **sum** of all your open buy position or look up the amount of FIAT in your account.
3\) calculate the amount of FIAT you sent to that exchange from the beginning \(for this you have to use **\+** \)
4\) calculate the amount of FIAT you cashed out from that exchange from the beginning \(for this you have to use **\+** \)
5\) make the **difference** between 3 and 4. This should be the total FIAT that is remaining on your exchange in FIAT and in BTC. \(for this you have to use\*\* \*\*\-  \)
6\) make the **difference** between 5 and 2 to know how much of your FIAT is for the moment in the form of BTC. \(for this you have to use\*\* \*\*\- \)
7\) calculate the FIAT value of your total BTC \(point 1\) you have at the present exchange rate. For this you have to **multiply** \(point1\) with the exchange rate to your FIAT. \(for this you have t**o** use \* \)
8\) See what value between 6 and 7 is the highest.
\- If the FIAT value of your BTC \(point 6\) is higher than the FIAT you paid for \(point 7\), you win the difference and you could potentially sell if you want to liquidate your position with a profit.
\- If the FIAT vallue of your BTC \(point 6\) is lower than the FIAT you paid for \(point 7\), you loose the difference.
You can liquidate now if you have the gut feeling it's going down and you'll buy it back lower to end up with more BTC.
Bonus: if you **divide** \(point6\)/\(point1\) that's your breakeven value. This is the value BTC should reach for you to not have lost/win any money. \(for this you have to use / \)
There, you have used \+, \-, \* and /

Demand is indeed the feedback loop to the scaling of the network (cost).
If demand ask for a lower price of the cost, miner will go off the network because it’ll be a negative feedback loop.
If demand offer a higher price than the cost, miners have the incentive to scale up this a positive feedback loop.
I think we are at the moment in a sweet spot demand +- = cost. And that’s why prices are stagnating. Maybe we converged to equilibrium.

For every seller there is a buyer.
It's just that the sellers are willing to part with their BTC at a lower price than the market price for some reason.
The seller makes it go down because they are selling. Without sellers no buyer can get BTC \(bar mining it\).
Buyers cannot make the price go down \(they'll drive it up\), Sellers can.
So why a seller is selling bellow market price? or even below what they purchased it for?
the loosing sellers:
1\) Fear, they fear that BTC is going any lower and that they'll be the bagholders and no one wants to be the bagholder.
2\) Because they need money and BTC is the last of their liquidity so they have to sell/spend it at the current value even if its a loss.
3\) late comer that need the money.
The winning sellers,
1\) they've purchased those BTC at a lower price than they are selling it even it it's below current market price and they don't believe it will go any higher and don't want to be the bagholder if they feel like BTC is overevaluated.
2\) They are still selling with a profit and don't believe in any more profit and they are parting their BTC because they need the liquidity for a better performing asset whatever it might be.
3\) Long time Hodler that need the money.
Once we run out of late comer that need the money AND long time hodler that need the money. The BTC will just be recirculating and stabilise at some value that the miner will agree to spend energy \(money\) to secure the network at.
@_date: 2018-05-29 08:33:24
What is the percentage of the world electricity used by payement method that could potentially be replaced by bitcoin? If Bitcoin replace those method of payement all that energy will be spared. Also when bitcoin goes stable and the energy spend securing the network is enough to render any attack too expensive to be successfull. There will be no incentive to make it more secure than it should be \(let say the miner rewards get in equilibrium as well so no extra miner have incentive to get into the game and drive the difficulty of the network any higher\).
then Bitcoin will be sucessfull.
Funny thing is, if Bitcoin doesn't go to an exagerated value, there will be no incentive to mine or secure the network more than it should be. It's a self regulated phenomenon that still need to converge to an equilibrium.
\- A stable BTC will have enough miner to secure the network without incentive to add more miners.
\- an overevaluated BTC need more security, but more miner will join in because it get more profitable.
\- an underevaluated BTC doesn't need more security because the benefit of attacking the network isn't worth it, and miner will leave the network because it isn't profitable for them anymore.
The difficulty adjustment is taking care of all that.
Unless a significant par of the network is leaving at the same time wich would decrease the confirmation time for a period of 2 weeks. And even that could be taken care of\-chain by the LN Network.
Also, the provider of electricity will adjust their rate following environemental requirements that might change in the future should the situation get out of control. That will also change the cost of securing the network \(driving miner out of the equation and driving the price of BTC to a new lower equilibrium\).
This electricity consumption is moot because how much energy bank are spending to secure your cash?
How much energy banks and payement provider are spending in their high rise building all over the world?

Let's say BTC finally get mainstream and is used as a currency or medium of exchange. BTC finally get stable at x USD and doesn't move anymore than \+\-0.5&amp; on a monthly basis and is unafected by the news because everyone knows that it isn't going to the moon and isn't going to be banned because it's now legit for everyone everywhere.
A lot of people might still have some BTC they've purchased significantly more \(x in this exemple\). These will be the final bagholders and will never recoup their "investment".
What will the value of x be? but it has to converge to a stable value no matter what this value may be or no one will use it for anything else than a speculative asset.
For the moment if you want to use it as a currency, you have to spend and replenish for BTC to artificially be stable for you. For this use case, depending on your country you'll be spending more money and time doing it than using traditionnal debit card or cash valued in FIAT.
I don't think any legitimate business will use any liquidity to do this. They will use their liquidity to do business wise decision like pumping it into R&amp;D to develop their next product that'll put them ahead of the competition, buy another company whose product offering will help them against their competitors, pay dividend to their shareholder to had value into owning a share in the company and keep the value of their share high, ...
I don't think the shareholder of big tech companies will appreciate having the liquididy of the company being used recklessly and this will be visible in the quarterly/yearly results and will drive the value of the share to the ground.

e.g. "These LED lightbult of X lumen that are menacing to replace my energy saving vapor of mercury lightbulb are sucking so many watts if we take into account all of the LED lightbult around the world !!!"
this argument only provide the consumption of the LED lightbulb on the table and the sheer amount of them globally. It doesn't provide the global energy consumption that the vapor of mercury lightbult need to produce the same amount of lumen. Nor does it provide any argument on the eco\-friendlyness or lack of toxicity of the vapor of mercury lightbulb and only say "these are energy savings lightbulb"
Does the LED industry has to come up with the burden of proof that vapor of mercury lightbult are less efficient than the newly introduced LED? that the LED is more eco\-friendly and less toxic than vapor of mercury lightbult?
Is it the responsability of the purchaser of a new technology to make an informed decision on what lightbulb technology to buy at a certain moment?

Them miner have to pay for electric, labor, asset depreciation you know. I won’t be surprised if the difficulty drop if any new tech don’t help make mining more efficient because of the low price of BTC.
It’s certainly not justified to go to 10k right now with the state of the network but miner will not secure the network at a loss for long.

The miner would mine empty block if there was no incentive to add transaction into it.
Also the network is bound to only have the transaction as incentive because the block reward is converging to zero with time.
Everyone(pool) is fighting to find the next block. When you are a miner you(your pool) spend a lot of energy and when you find a block you are granted the block reward (value decreasing has the time goes by) this is creating new BTC on the network and you are allowed to insert in your block some of the transactions sitting in the mempool. To optimize the return of your investment you’ll pick the most profitable transaction (highest paying) to be inserted in the next block. This is a bit like the knapsack problem. With time, because the block reward is diminishing, the miners will only have the transaction cost to compensate them for the cost of their effort. When the block reward will be close to zero, they will not be printing new BTC anymore and will “only” have the role of securing the network.

Edit: To make things clear, this was a obvious joke!

Once you send your coins to the adresses linked to that Ledger, your wallets are automatically emptied by the scammer who keeps track of the coins movement on seeds he have control of.
the comment about Amazon was because Amazon share the stock between vendors, so if you order a ledger NanoS "directly" from Ledger on amazon, you might get one from the stock of a scammer vendor.

I've made my purchase today at 11:52 and the price was +-9564€ on coinbase at that moment.
Bitpay used 9408.09€ as exchange rate at the time of purchase. That's already a 1.7% difference that I didn't account for.
Edit: Bitpay bumped the price of the item by +-1.1% for ***"network cost"*** even though I've also paid the miner fee on top of the charged amount from Bitpay when I've made the payment from by BTC wallet. Pfff they also don't apply any such "network cost" if you pay with Btrash.

Everyone here has an attention span of 2 days. If BTC-FIAT isn’t going down or up more than 5% in any given day then Bitcoin isn’t doing anything to them.
Come on, if BTC is stable then it give people more trust in using it as a currency/electronic cash instead of just gambling on its value going down or up according to their bets.
It’s just like people are having a gambling addiction here.

Ok, if you have 50$ worth of BTC. Now try to send it to an external wallet you and only you have the control of the private key. (Electrum, ledger, ...).
You want to be able to cOntrol your BTC if you want to send them to another exchange (to buy some alts) or to purchase goods and service in BTC.
You cannot do this as far as I know on robinhood.
If you only want to day trade and get fiat back to your regular bank account. I guess robinhood is good for your use case. It’s just that robinhood might as well have no bitcoin lying around the way they are doing business and it sounds
Really fishy if a bank run ever happen on them (everyone selling BTC and withdrawing fiat on them)

As far as I understand there is still plenty of BTC to go around without accounting for BTC that are left to be mined. Why would the BTC mined on the cheap be worth so much?
Also, if a miner isn’t competitive anymore because of costs, they’ll be left in the dust by the miners that are still profitable. It’ll sadly centralize the mining effort in region of low electricity cost and low labor cost running the latest most efficient tech. BTC nethash is ridiculously high and still justify to mine BTC in region of low electricity cost. Running a S9 with residential rate isn’t profitable for a while now.
People that want to buy BTC want to buy BTC at the lowest price possible, they are driving the price at the limit of profitability for miners, pushing hobby miner and low scale mining operation to shutdown their rig further reinforcing the domination of a few mining operation :-(

So what makes all the bitcoin already mined worth so much more if only the tip of the pile is more expensive to mine?

The network could very well go down in total hashrate.
The mining technology might be more efficient.

Coinbase pro is fine by me.
- Limit buy order.
- Withdraw to ledger nano when the limit order is filled (I use the notification feature on coinbase app to know if the price fell below my limit buy).
- the BTC is usually on my wallet by the next block (coinbase pay the miner fee for you).
Always keep a bit of cash in the exchange to catch a dip and profit.

I’m down 10% overall. On the BTC I’ve purchased. Haven’t sold yet and riding it out hopefully.
Not counting some money ive put on mining hardware (GPU rig) I only broke even 30% of it an is now useless as the electricity cost is now more expensive than running the thing. Hence why I’m buying when it dips.
All is not lost, I’ll do a crossfire setup for PC gaming with two AMD GPU, the ram and a gold power supply and sell the remaining for BTC.

Not really infinitely. Even with LN you have to open/close a channel, on the main chain it's only 1/1M of a BTC that is the smallest possible.
And even off\-chain, there is a numerical representation that is finite even if really small.
You would need infinite storing space for an infinitely divisible BTC.

I think that if you have some fiat and or BTC lying around on CB pro they are a bit like a reserve to withdraw faster.
Say you have 100 euro and 0.01 BTC on CB sitting in limit order. And you deposit 100 euro on CB with SEPA it appear on the same day, then transfert to CB pro instantly, then purchase some BTCand transfer them to cold wallet. It’s all possible because you have some fiat and BTC covering the potential loss if your bank is claiming back the fiat you just transferred.
Now if you have 0 euro and 0 BTC on CB pro. You transfer 100 euro to CB, then to CB pro then buy BTC and try to transfer to cold storage, CB doesn’t have such a credit line for you to allow withdrawing you BTC so fast.

Dude certainly made a Monte Carlo simulation of the BTCUSD dynamics, he was able to modelize all aspects of BTC being a global network and token being exchanged in multiple different Fiat and other crypto, the dynamics of securing the network and taking into account the cost of electricity in all region of the world and ran prediction of the difficulty level over time and the advances of silicon Engraving techniques leading to more efficient ASIC developments. Then he let run the simulation for 2 years on his covert operation supercomputer. After being certain he converged to a solution, the “true value” of BTC was determined to be 500$ but this was after applying a fudge factor to the complicated simulation for good measure as a conservative act of generousness. Now go on and short BTC to 500$ and be rich as fuck. Thanks you so much!

Dude, if Coinbase is busted, it'll be another Mt.Gox all over again. BTC and the other tokens trading on Coinbase will go down in flame and all cryptos with it. I don't think crypto will come back from such a disaster.
I'm hopefull that the level of security/insurance is at another level these days though. But we should not wish for Coinbase to go bust ala Mt.Gox because crypto will no recover from it or will take years.
A hack from a reasonnable amount Coinbase would have the liquidity or be insured to bite the bullet would not affect the market as long as users are not impacted and can get away with their money or crypto. But if Coinbase isn't solvent anymore and users are parted from their money/crypto, then it'll be hell when you see the volume of money/crypto Coinbase is dealing with. And I'm not talking about the daily volume, but the total volume that Coinbase is holding at any given time (just look at the freaking order book in Fiat and Crypto, there is an ungodly amount of money on Coinbase).

You got in early, not everyone did so and even so, not all early adopters were able to hodl trough 600x gains without cashing out on the way up at some point to lock in some profits or using the money to clean out their debt or pay a bill before it went ATH. Insight is 20/20.
some people, and I guess a lot of them, purchased BTC above current market prices and are now at a loss. I don’t condemn people that made poor financial decisions and purchased crypto with money they could not let sit in the form of BTC because in the euphoria of it all they though it was a sure way of getting rich quick. But for those people, they could very well wait forever for BTC to go up to their entry level (not even talking about them getting some profits)
This is a market where people can bet for (long) or against (short). Short is a necessary mechanism so the price doesn’t go stupidly up like it did last year and now maybe that BTC will get more stable thanks to it but will not get to the entry level of some people.
I welcome being wrong and see what small BTC I have skyrocket in value.

Your margin, if any, greatly depend on your price/kWh.
If your electricity makes it too expensive to mine with a AntMiner S9, Along is producing a new Miner more efficient than the S9.
Also ASIC manufacturer could mine the next generation ASIC "for testing purpose" before releasing it to the public.
not that I recommend using NH pools to get BTC payement with SHA256, here is a profitability calculator for the S9:
With my cost of electricity, I would loose money mining with the S9. You can expect some hobby miner will fall of the network if the price of BTC continue to fall.
For a large operation, you also have to factor in rental, depreciation of the asset, salary to evaluate your margin.
If the BTC continue to fall, not only hobby miner will shutdown, but also medium operation that don't have the lowest electricity rate because they have to pay those bills and need to be consistently profitable to continue their operation.

Just a question, we will all be dead by then but hey. 
At some point the block reward will essentially be dust. Say just a few sat, not covering themselves for the transfer fee.
Does the block reward bundle the block reward + Fee =&gt; no problem. Or are the fee and block reward separated when paid to the miner. =&gt; problem.
Sorry if stupid question.

Those stupid price prediction out of people invested in BTC are ridiculous. And they are in no way an authority in setting the price of BTC.
I’m myself invested in BTC and would gladly welcome a bump in price to not be in the red. But such wild ridiculous claim on BTC still doing 50x it’s present value after the price increase from last year is not justified. Let see the adoption and use of BTC go mainstream and stop speculating on the future value of it if it’s juste for selling and buying it back and forth without using it as a medium of exchange or a store of value.

There is a loooooooong way to go between 42 (in two pools) and 51 in one pool. Even more so when new manufactured of SHA256 ASIC are showing up now to dilute those numbers.
And even 51% for a short while doesnt guarantee to be able to build consistently the longest chain with the most PoW to be able to arm the main blockchain.
They probably don’t own (thus don’t control) all the hardware of the people joining those pools. So Bitmain really don’t control all those rigs pointed at their pools. People that are running them and are at risk of loosing money if BTC would be attacked will most probably point their rig to another pool.
It’s a sweet spot between luck ratio and stable revenue and loosing it all for miners. People will distribute in a way to avoid this. Joining a smaller pool only means that you are getting revenue less consistently (all pool fee being equals) but on average you should get the same revenue based on a continuous operation.
TL;DR This is just FUD

@_date: 2019-08-05 09:38:37
Is it possible, yes.
Is it profitable? I don't think so.
To breakeven on your investment on the mining equipement you'd have to mine 24/7.
This is because the profitability always goes down as time goes by for a given equipement. (difficulty goes up, your hashrate stay the same).
Solar Energy only work for a part of the day. Having a battery system to compensate for the night is only going to overdimension your solar and battery setup adding on the initial costs and pushing your BEP even further.
If you already have the solar energy with extra capacity and your network provider doesn't compensate for the electricity you are injecting back to the grid, then you could buy a old mining and CHEAP mining rig. Cheap being the key element because you'll still have to breakeven on that investment. If you have a gaming PC, you could always point it at Nicehash and collect a few sats, given you are monitoring your consumption in that scenario. Again, won't be worth the energy you'll put in.

well That actual cost of producing 1 BTC should be the average cost of producing 1 BTC from the total amount of BTC. Not the cost of producing a BTC from a last block of the chain. The incentive for the miner that would continue to mine the last block of the chain will be the cost of transaction. 
So yes the price will go up as the average price to produce a BTC will go up with each halving, but the classic fallacy is to have the expectation that because it’s twice as expensive to mine a block with 1/2 reward at the same difficulty level, that all of the BTC that are already in existence and were much cheaper to mine are suddenly worth more.

Thanks for the answer! So they are two separate utxo paid to the successful miner adress.
So for the utxo of the last non zero block reward it’s just a 1 sat utxo (as I said we will all be dead by then). Meaning the the cost of spending that utxo is higher than its value (dust). Am I right or is it still worth spending a 1 sat utxo on chain with another utxo as input?
If yes, we have much less than 21M bitcoin to go around?
Edit: can the miner use directly the Coinbase transaction as an input of the fee UTXOs were he collect the change? Then there is no problem has he collect the dust with the fee that by then would represent most of the reward.
@_date: 2019-08-28 05:00:41
They are long unused UTXOs on the public ledger. Who has the private key to those holding could move them.
Best theory at the moment is that the dude who mined them is dead or lost the keys.

Any life changing amount (like paying your house cash) or lambo money.
A lambo should be around 21 BTC new. And that’s just the cost of acquisition. If you need to maintain and insure the thing you’ll need even more.
A house should be around 42 BTC for a 3 bedroom house with a nice garden.
So yeah, 1 BTC at the moment isn’t any of this and would not be impressive.
Don’t forget that you’ll have to pay tax when you cash out. Depending on the region of the world it could be 30 to 50% of it. (If you have that many BTC your cost basis is close to zero) so double that BTC amount if you don’t want to finish in jail.

Yes storage is relatively cheap but there is also the bandwidth cost to run a node. The time it takes to download the whole chain to initialize a node. Increasing the block size is a naive approach because those doesn’t scale easily. 
As for storage, since there is no incentive to run a node, you want the hardware to be cheap to acquire and to run.

If you are talking about different miner (from different pool) competing to get the next block, yes indeed.

Imagine that the BTC network is a pizza place that cook a pizza every 10 minutes and divide the salesfigure amongs the people baking the pizza. Pizza is a rare delicacy being cooked only at this place and is all the craze at the moment, people and are paying good money to buy pizza from this pizza place:
\- 4 people cook the pizza and 10 minutes later they divide it amongst each other. Every cook get 1/4 of a whole pizza (say they are a pool of 100&amp; of the network for simplicity sake). Everyone find it fair because the 10 minutes of work was worth 1/4 of a pizza. You think this is a sweet job and invest a good chunk of your savings to move to another city and start baking pizza because it pays so well. ( This is an analogy to BTC mining being profitable for you for a specific hardware at today's difficulty of the network. So you think you'll be printing money and splurdge your saving into a sweet Bitmain S9 \+ Power supply).
\- 8 people cook the pizza, the pizza will not come in 5 minutes because the oven is magic and can't give you pizza any faster because you're more at the task, everyone get 1/8 of the pizza. Everyone still find it fair if 1/8 of pizza is still worth 10 minutes of labor. (This is an analogy of you being now a miner, and as time goes by you see your mining profit dwindling away and the cost of having purchased the ASIC is now looking like a foolish attempt to get rich quick).
\- 16 people cook the pizza, again the oven is magic and 10 minutes later the pizza come and has to be shared. now let's say 1/16 of a pizza doesn't justify working there anymore. And there is so many people with your skillset on the job market no one wants to hire you for a similar position (this is an analogy of your sweet Bitmain S9 having now the value of a paperweight sometimes in the future).
\- People having the skillset to bake pizza are easily found in the market and some accept a smaller wage than you. (This is an analogy to other people having access to electricity at cheap rate VS your cost of electricity)
Alternative endings (combo are possible):
\- You are fired of the pizza place. you're out of a job. (This is an analogy of your sweet Bitmain S9 being defective for some reasons and out of warranty and is now a paperweight).
\- The pizza place isn't a regulated industry and other business are opening in all corners of the city and are selling ersatz of your rare pizza. (This is an analogy of new altcoins poping up everyday and diluting the value of the crypto market).
\- Everyone is tired of eating pizza at so many different places and the price of the pizza is going down.(This is an analogy to the loss of interest in crypto as it isn't perceived as anything else than speculation at the moment by the large public).
If you consider being a miner, do not only consider if you'll be "profitable" at the:
\- present cost of electricity.
\- present difficulty of the network.
\- present value of the BTC.
But also what when your profit marging will be enough to even out the purchase of the hardware.
try to factor in your labor time (but you can write it off if you consider this a fun hobby).
Is BTC mining profitable at the moment?
I don't think so unless your electricity is damn cheap or free.
Also, do not HODL too much, sometimes you have to take a profit, don't be a bagholder.
@_date: 2018-06-08 08:07:42
well the firepower doesn't matter much because you'll be working in a pool so you'll get your fair share of the job. The problem is that you'll be competing with people with lower cost of operation and with better gear quality. And soon your firepower won't be profitable anymore and I wish you to have recoup your investment by then because profitability doesn't go up on the long term, it only goes down.
What you have as a hobby miner against larger setup is: 
\- Cost of airconditionning. Having a smaller enough setup will not need air conditionning.
\- Cost of labor. you'll be the one maintaining the rig operation (cleaning and supervision).
\- Cost of real Estate. Large operation have to justify the cost of the large place they are renting. You on the other hand only have to find a small place for your small operation.
\- Being able to wait for your profit. You could take your mined BTC and put them on a regular basis at a limit sell order a bit higher than the market price of the day you mined it. This would be a way to squeeze a few &amp; of profitability. But don't be a bagholder. Large operation have to pay rent and huge cost of electricity. They have to cash out on a regular basis, you don't (unless you're going in debt for your mining operation but then I would advise against doing it).
You have to keep your operation small unless you want to end up with those costs as well.

Also, would it be possible to extract your magic number byt looking for equaly spaced words that would yield a 12/24 word seed with no duplicate? (I just read that you can have a duplicate in a seed so that's not an issue).
I also would like to make a procedure and segment it in a way that my heir can retrieve the original seed and use the BTC. But also that they can't do it untill I'm dead or a vegetable.

How many BTC do you need live on coinbase to have to be part of the top 10% on said exchange?
@_date: 2019-08-05 09:52:07
[Electrum.org]( is free AFAIK.
BTC is permissionless, you don't need anybody's authorisation to use it.
Obtaining BTC if you are not a miner or you don't know someone to sell it to you for cash is going to be the problem.
You may find some ATM that doesn't requires ID around you and they may have a webcam to scan a QR code of one of your public adress. That would be a way to obtain some if you don't know anyone to buy it from. ATM have a huge spread, but if that's your only way and you want to buy a HODL, then do it.

Keep to the plan. If you planned to buy monthly a set amount. Just buy that set amount on schedule. If you modify your strategy, make it part of your updated plan and stick to it.
Buy BTC based on your plan and not on emotion because of market situation. You could go ball deep now and it’ll fall even further and you’ll regret it. You never know...
If you want to have a higher temporal action. Just DCA 25 euro a week instead of 100 euro a month.
Only invest what you’re willing to loose or live without while BTC might be below your exit plan.
Also have an exit plan and keep at it. If you think BTC will see 25k then exit when it hit 25k if you think 100k/1M it is all up to you as long as you keep to the game plan.

Yes indeed, But I understood that the private key (not the seed you are mentioning) of my electrum wallet was stored on the PC I’m using it (maybe encrypted I would hope) and the private key of my ledger is stored on my ledger and you only have 3 chances to find my PIN before the ledger resets. The thing is suposedly tamper proof so I guess the private key is safer on it than on an infected computer.
The seed (the 12 or 24 word you are mentioning) has to be stored on paper in a safe place and has to be copied by hand and not on a computer. The seed is a mnemonics used to recover the private key. That also I have some concerns (fire, theft, ...) how do you store your seed?

1) That an unconfirmed transaction.
2) The protocol/consensus between the nodes won’t allow for a double spend. And yes the transaction are waiting in a pool to be inserted in the next block. It’s like the knapsack problem, the transactions that would yield the better profits for the pool solving the block will be chosen to be inserted in the next block. 
That’s also why a zero fee transaction could potentially be choosen from the mempool if another transaction with a higher fee takes it as an input.

And because the bank alway win, less than 50% or people are winning playing crypto.

Yes but it’s kind of hard to do it with a pen and a paper and repeatedly hash the last block header. A powerful purpose made computer is probably more efficient to the task. I’m not sure that we could find the solution in 10 minutes even if we were all competing with pen and paper.
But maybe if I’m doing it with such powerful computer and you are doing it with a pen and paper within 10 minutes, I might be able to write pages in the book faster than you and collect all the rewards from writing a new page in the book at a super fast pace!

“even if it would take you a long time to find a block”
That’s were I think that the difference is coming from. You might receive a larger share from the pie as less miner are fighting to get the next valid block but it will take longer for everyone that remains to find a valid block until the difficulty retarget to a more manageable level for the remaining hashrate. So you are being impacted by the cost of electricity. A student in his dorm stealing electricity to run a s9 will win some, à dude paying for electricity above a certain point will be less profitable.
The research space for a nonce of the next valid block depend of the transaction set you put into the block you are trying to solve. As many miner/pool are competing they are probably trying to solve a different transaction set, so the research space is as large (the nonce is a 32bit integer chosen at random) but they would get a different hash for a same nonce because your are not necessarily trying to solve an identical block.
Then, you have just an equal chance (maybe not because who knows how many valid nonce you could find for different block if you were able to go trough the whole 2^32 possible nonce, some block with a given transaction set might have more thus could be “easier” to solve) 
At the end, it is all about the amount of hashing power you represent In the total hashrate (if you are mining in a pool with 100% luck). But all the participant are playing with an handicap because the difficulty is too high for everyone still playing.
To simplify the problem. If all miners were mining into the same pool. The whole pool would get 12.5BTC for each valid block. Now some of the participant are dropping out of the network. So the same 12.5BTC is shared proportionnaly to each remaining participant. So each participant get more BTC per valid block. But it took much longer to find this block. So more electricity was needed to get that valid block so people that are paying for electricity are hurting their bottom line. And bitcoin doesn’t get more expensive because it is temporarily harder as we know that in less than 2016 block the difficulty will be adjusted down.

It’s just that it’s extremely unlikely in the current context.
Theoretically a forked branch could reach consensus if the current version doesn’t convince a majority anymore.
Change to the code doesn’t only concern the scheduled reward. But a scheduled reward change is extremely unlikely to reach consensus.
Without consensus a new branch would just create another shitcoin such as BCH and BSV.

That site is the first site I got on when I wanted to sell some BTC obtained as a payement (thanks google). I looked for an exchange if I ever needed to send the BTC from my wallet to an exchange and press the sell button. 
I though the whole thing was strange because it bashed Bitcoin while being Bitcoin.com site ... then I ended up on r/ BTC and saw that people were not talking about BTC there... basically a bait and switch luring you to buy an alt coin from people looking to buy BTC. 
After a lot of search (it’s hard earned money we’re talking about, and scam are rampant in the space) I ended up knowing the differences between BTC and BCH, bitcoin com VS bitcoin.org, r/Bitcoin vS r/ btc 
Finally I’m using Coinbase. If I wanted to acquire or sell BTC, there is no fee for market maker which is a plus. I know a lot of people have problem with Coinbase but it’s alright for me. 
Be sure to never let your coins on an exchange if you don’t mean to trade them. You never know what would happen on any exchange. If your stack of coin start to be too much money you’re confortable to potentially loose, buy a hardware wallet and be sure your seed is backed up and never see anything digital. Do not take a picture of your seed, do not save it on a computer or a cloud, do not print it out on a printer. Write it by hand with a ball pen, store it in a fireproof safe. If your seed is compromised, your money is gone within seconds.

This. 
It hurt the reputation however safe the BTC network may be. The chain is only as strong as it’s weakest link.
Also the bank have insured their fund, so after a robery, they get their fund back. And if a bank go bust the saving account are insured up to a certain amount so if you’re playing safely you should not be out of your money.
If an exchange go bust, most probably the customer will get nothing. 
However it seems that exchanges have a higher security than before and most of the fund are on cold wallet, so only a portion of the BTC are really on a hot wallet for daily transaction. If they have the funds to cover the loss of the hot wallet, they could potentially be able to reimburse their customers from their own pocket (through the fee they got previously and continuously). Or maybe they’ll be insured. Once customer knows their fund is safe and insured, working on an exchange will be safer than secur NG your own private key.
Securing your own private key equate a the moment to bury deep your stash of money and storing the treasure map either mentally or securing the treasure map. You could fail to secure your treasure map and never be able to access your fund anymore (forget the seed, loose the private key) or having the treasure map stolen from someone close or having your house burn down, ... their is so much more possibility to loose your coins then to loose your fiat.
Unless you are living in a country with hyper-inflation, then you have a bigger problem at hand because you have more chance to be knifed for your grocery bag than thinking about crypto.
We are still at a really early stage for the masses, but I’m sure thing will get into an equilibrium. But the equilibrium might be either at a price that you won’t like or end up being ungodly rich. Nobody knows the future and anybody pretending *insert ticker* will reach * insert absurd number * by * insert any date * is a biased person that would profit of such prediction and hoping his prediction will be right because he’ll cash out for fiat at that point and forget about crypto.

The device doesn’t hold any bitcoin. You just have the key to control some utxo on the ledger associated with this key.
That key is the same weight if you have no BTC or if everyone for some reason decided to send you their utxo to one of your public adress associated with the key in your ledger. So yes theoretically all of them currently in circulation (not 21 million yet though).

I have got a particular Shitcoin I’ve been mining for a month straight with 10 GPU for a total of 2400 of that shitcoin burning maybe 100-200 euro worth of electricity.
Now I can trade it at market price for 1.1mBTC and the withdrawal fee on a small exchange is 1mBTC.
I should have know better than to mine that shit or to exchange it directly to BTC and I would have got +-12mBTC and be almost in the green instead.

The nonce is a 32bit field chosen at random.
For a solo miner it’s just choosing it at random with a RNG that avoid reuse. For a pool to avoid reuse thus wasting ressource, they would have to do some “divide and conquer” to slice the research space amongst individual miner of the pool.
Avoiding reuse it the only optimizing move a pool could make as each nonce has an equal chance to get the hash below difficulty target.

CPU and GPU cannot compète with ASIC when it comes to SHA256 used to mine Bitcoin.
And even with ASIC, you’ll need the latest generation and a really cheap electricity costs if you don’t want to pay more for electricity than you’ll get BTC.
And even with mining with a profit, you’ll have to breakeven on your initial investment.
Much better to buy BTC at the moment.
Last year was an abnormally profitable bit of time were miner made tons of profit for a short while (but didn’t necessarily broke even on their investment depending on their initial cost of investment and cost of electricity).
Now we’re just back to BTC being able to be mined profitably by the people with the lowest cost of labor and the lowest cost of electricity.
Some big operation have already bankrupted because the electricity cost went higher than when they started. Or they scaled up too quickly on credit.

“ As mentioned, with each halvening the asset becomes more scarce which therefore should organically increase price.”
How does BTC become more scares with each halvening? Don’t we keep on creating more BTC and add those to the existing circulating supply making it ... less scarce in a whole?!?
Scarcity doesn’t give any value to an asset by this only metric.

The fee part mining a new block is often not paid to the miner and is being kept by the pool. (Operating a pool is very expensive and mining empty block is less risky than trying to include transaction into it but is being frowned upon for good reason).

Without volume and activity the price cannot be stable.
If only a few are in the buy/sell order book, it isn’t hard to push the price up/down.
Using BTC means people have to buy/sell BTC constantly. Ideally stabilizing the price at whatever valuation. And that’s the good thin we should look up to. (Imagine the order book with a buy wall and a sell wall at spot price)
Fluctuating BTC means that not enough people are using it as a currency/medium of exchange. So as long as BTC is moving up and down wildly it means that it isn’t used yet and just being speculated on.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:52:28

You know what they say about catching a falling knife ... 
First if you never invested in Bitcoin, get verified on a reputable exchange and buy a small amount of BTC. (Like 1mBTC) Just so you can test the workflow for the moment you want to pull the trigger.
Second, never buy more than you can afford completely loosin should BTC drop in price some more.
Third, have a strategy and stick to it. Don’t let your emotions get the better of you.
4th, Have a look at the trading fee on your selected exchange. For example in Pro.Coinbase.com you have zero fee for a limit buy/sell order.
5th, I’ve never done it, but if you have a exit strategy to secure your winnings. “Stop Loss” could be your friend. But they are easy to be triggered with the volatility of BTC. Again don’t let your feeling get the better of you. It could save you from loosing money more than a hypotethical BGD after it got triggered.
6. Learn about the tax situation of crypto in your country. The exchanges that does KYC can and will tell about your activity to the taxmen. Be ready. Don’t listen to advices on internet and seek for professional help.
And last, depending on the situation when you’ll be verified and able to buy BTC, at least wait for a recovery signal.
And very last, depending on how good you are to secure your key. If you want to hodl long term. Get the BTC out of the exchange to a wallet you control the key.
Very very last, hardware wallet are 100euro a pop and might put your mind at ease. Again test the workflow with a small amount to send BTC to and from your hardware wallet. Buy the hardware wallet straight from the manufacturer. Do not buy it from amazon because they are pooling the stock with other vendo that might sell a compromised wallet.

I’m trying to not be emotional and wait for the next paycheck before putting more liquidity into BTC. 
This way of working refrain me to put too much in the down slope in case it continue to fall. Just at the risk of not putting enough if it goes back up before :-) 
But since I haven’t sold, I still have some BTC if it were to go up. Well it’s play money at this point so I won’t be rich with what I’m holding even if BTC ATH again but I don’t intend to put too much as I have other things to purchase at the moment that are more important short terms.

Let’s say I order Pizza with coin from a wallet used for receiving mining payement, they are anonymous (unless the mining pool AND ISP get audited) until now this wallet is anonymous. After my pizza delivery, my wallet is now linked to my home address through the internet payement system.
Ideally I should create a intermediary BTC adresse to serve as a broker for a one time payement. But even then, without using a mixer I can’t spend my BTC without linking my “anonymous” BTC to my identity.
If I don’t need anonymity, standard way of internet payement are fee less in my country so I don’t need (yet) BTC for payement.
Thus I’m HODLing the few satoshi I have until I see a easy way of payement with it.

If the price increase over the cost of mining. People would consider to continue to invest to expend the network.
If the price is below the cost of mining. People will consider shutting down their setup (and buying instead if they have to continue providing the coin by contract) starting with miners with the highest cost of mining (highest cost of electricity mainly)
It’s been two difficulty retarget of bitcoin of decrease in difficulty. This would indicate that the miners are hurting with current price.
People trading at current price without looking at these indicator might miss the bottom.
If price continue to tank, more miners will be forced to shUtdown.
Last year, seen the difficulty of mining and basically the same tech available just mean that BTC was HEAVILY inflated.

If bitcoin is overbought, miners are scaling up the network because they are making a tidy profit and have extra cash to claim a higher % of the network
If bitcoin is oversold, miners are running at a loss because they have to pay the bill. Old tech and miners running with expensive electricity have to shutdown scaling down the network.
Ideally we should have a stable price and a stable hashrate (all things being equal such as technological advances in mining efficiency and electricity cost)
Now we are in a situation were mining operation are hurting (hashrate is going down for 2 difficulty retarget, many/most of hobby miner are getting off the grid, some major mining operation are filling for bankruptcy) , it means that Bitcoin is oversold for the current size of te network. If the price continue to tank, only the most healthy mining operation will continue to sustain the network until the price stabilize. Then we will be able to shoot back up once we reach the bottom of the pool :-)
You also have delay in scaling up because of the lead time to deliver the hardware to the miners + deployment time.
You have delay in scaling down because miners are not shutting down until they loose hope of BTC price recovery or when the debt collector start knocking at their doors.
New advances in technology could increase the hashrate for a identical price of BTC because those miner will get a better margin over their competition. This will push older tech out of the network continuously.

At school, MSc in CS around 2010ish.
Though it was too expensive back then and it was freaking underground, had no money to get onboard mining/purchasing anyway. It was just a discussion subject and not really clear to me.
At some time it went around 200 euro. I though I missed the train so I was fuck it anyway.
Then it was 600 euro and I was pfff I’ve definitely missed this shit. Still did nothing. Once again I think I had not much money to invest anyway.
In 2017 shit went berserk and all my colleague talked about it, it wasn’t a underground project anymore. I FOMOed hard I tried to mine alt for BTC, bought some end of 2018. Now I’m in the red both for mining and buying because I HODLed it all.

Took me a bit to understand what you were asking. What would happen if Satoshi Nakamoto (the person/entity/group) would reappear and prove that he still is in control of the coins we know are his. By moving them or signing a message in relashioship with their public address. It would greatly increase the current available supply and should drive the price down.
But in all seriousness, the person/entity/group behind Satoshi nakamoto is most likely dead or not in control anymore of those adress. How would you HODL so much BTC after such a crazy appreciation is humanely impossible. Everyone has bill to pay, everyone has a price for such a early retirement opportunity.

BTC at 20k was way overestimated. Mining it was even profitable in area of the world with the most expensive electricity. Miners could not add hashrate to the network fast enough until July/August were the network scaled to breakeven price of mining in area with the cheapest electricity. From then on, it was a chicken game and unsustainable miners started dropping from the network.
Seems we have reached a bottom though.

If you make a one to one copy of the protocol and launch it, the longest chain with the most proof of work will still be BTC. So your nodes will simply sync the BTC blockchain. (That’s how the software is distributed).
If you make some tweaks to create a new chain from a newly created genesis block while not changing anything much, it’ll be worth nothing and could get attacked by a 51% attack really quickly. 
Same if you decide to use a technical tweak to make the BTC chain fork thus having the history of BTC in your new blockchain (the airdrop trick to give free coins to attract new users to your chain). This is used by some coins to steal private key that have to be entered in some sort of (malicious) wallet to claim the airdrop
Also the difficulty retarget of 2016 block will be problematic with a large availability of SHA256 miner that could switch on and off from your network. The block time could range from extremely quick to cold age slow every 2016 blocks.
You also will have to get it accepted on an exchange. Promote its existence. thus differentiate it against BTC.

Was paid 0.22 BTC by Nicehash for running a multi GPU rig for a few month. I ended up loosing more money than I was paid because of electricity and cost of purchase of it all. I’m HODLing these and they keep loosing value.
Purchased more BTC with fiat as GPU mining wasn’t a good idea after all. I’m S
still down on that “investment” as well.
Now I’m regularly throwing good money after bad in the hope of a reversal. At least my average buy price is decreasing but still well below spot price.
Im selling the rig piece by piece and I’ll get more BTC with the cost of selling it than I would have ever be paid with Nicehash.
I also mined a few shitcoins (ETH, RVN, ETHO), they also tanked and honestly I don’t understand their use case mumbo jumbo but I’m HODLing on to my modest stacks. Now it’s all in BTC going forward and that’s it.
I’m going to be the ultimate bagholder. At least the tax situation is easy since I haven’t sold anything. (I can’t get tax cut on a loss anyway in my country, so no point in doing that).

If this is to be a recurring event. I would suggest to people that would like to take part to the event but aren’t so sure about the security aspect of securing your own private keys to do it with a small portion of their trading stack. 
So the risk will be minimum and then by next year be able to do it with a maximum portion of their trading stack.
It’s already too late to purchase a hardware wallet before tommorow if they don’t have one already. So they’ll have to run a full node (kinda advance in such a short amount of time for a noob and there isn’t much time to sync the whole blockchain anyway) 
So the last option for a noob is to use a software wallet such a Electrum (from the .org website !!!) and transfert a little bit there for the event of this year. It’ll be a good exercice :-)

Is was overbought before it started dropping this summer and mining operation kept scaling up.
Now that it’s oversold, hashrate follow price and unprofitable mining operation are bankrupted and hobby miner have pulled the plug.
To see the hashrate going up, wait until the 7nm generation get more adoption to replace the hashrate lost by older generation miner leaving the network.
There is always a lag between scaling up and scaling down.
Scaling up takes time to react to a rally of the price because the miners have to be delivered before getting on the network. The profit were massive in december-January and prompted the miner to hoard a shitload of mining equipment. It just took time for all that equipment to get on the network nullifying all profit to be made.
Scaling down take also time because there is a bit of chicken game before one realize they cannot keep running at a loss. It goes faster for people running it as a business and have large utility to pay. Some hobby miner are delusional and are mining at a loss hoping for the price to come back up. Some people have access to free electricity (hobby miner with electricity included in the rent and other people stealing electricity at work/school/dorm)
Mining is like trading, everyone is a genius during a bull run. Except that it’s harder to liquidate when you are a miner that didn’t broke even on his investment.

I though the miner in the flood picture circulating recently weren’t SHA256 miner. Also 70% of the mining power of Bitcoin located in China is a bit much isn’t? These were Octominers and GPU and the latest Equihash ASIC miners on those pictures.
So if those rigs were not pointed at BTC, why would the global hashrate of BTC be affected? 
Thus the confirmation isnt delayed? thus the transaction fee should remain unafected. This looks like a poorly written article without much source of information.
I’ll google the BTC confirmation time behavior since the 24 June to see if this flood affected it. That’ll be a better indicator.
Edit: the block time is still on target, so this news is just garbage. Or those were not enough to affect the global hashrate of BTC.

We are still +5% ahead of schedule for this epoch. This means the hashrate is constantly being upgraded.
This is just a little bit of bad luck for a block or two and the nethash being derived from the block time and current difficulty is having its estimate a bit off.

A newly forked coin with low nethash will probably start exchanging with a high amount of confirmation for deposit/withdrawal 
Also the a bad reputation for crypto currency can have a negative impact on BTC.
If a exchange goes insolvent, then all crypto trading pair on the platform will be impacted and it will be bad for BTC

If it come to a point that a satoshi is too small to be practical,
Say that at the moment a hypothetical beer cost 1.49 euro and a candybar cost 50 cents.
If one day the same beer cost 149 satoshi and the same candy bar cost 50 satoshi (or even 15 and 5 in extreme case).
Then it means that there is no ultra inflation compared to the fiat pricing of today. But that BTC has obtained the status of global money for the whole planet.
And if it happen in my lifetime and I still HODL what I have today in Bitcoin, I wouln't have to work anymore.
Since my BTC position is rather small, many people are better possitionned than me to dump their hodling before me.

It depend on their operational cost. Mainly electricity and efficiency of the rigs. Then, rent and staff.
Country with low cost of electricity and labor have a clear edge against western country with expensive electricity and cost of labor.
At the cost of my electricity, I would be in the red operating a Bitmain S9 atm even if I would not take into account rent and labor as a hobby miner. So BTC mining at this leverl of difficulty and available hardware is already not profitable for some countries. It’ll will be kept for large mining operation or hobby miner having access to cheap electricity.
Profit are in the toilet for miners. Also for GPU mineable altcoin. You can buy GPU from Nvidia by 10 units now. They were limited to two unit per person until recently and that’s when they were in stock, now it seems Nvidia would like to get rid of their oveprovisionned stock.

And the cost of securing the network kinda climbed as well. Block reward + transaction fee have to compensate the cost of running a mining operation.

I stopped reading at “Budish suggests that these fees should be 100x higher (or more) to secure Bitcoin’s blockchain.”
Where are you technically able to rent 51% of BTC hashing power? I’m not even talking about rental price, just the mere possibility to rent so much SHA256 hashing power at the same time?
Even for shitcoins that you could rent more than 51% of the hashing power on Nicehash, Increasing transaction fee would also increase the reward for the person able to rent more than 51% of the network.
The author of this article is probably mixing up information from the original source, but applying the same conclusion of what may happen on “Nicehashable” coins to the sheer power of the BTC network is ridiculous.

Depending on how you lost it:
1. If they are already transferred from your original adress to someone else adress. You can't. I'ts impossible. BTC transactions are irreversible. You have to write off those "almost 2BTC" from your book at a loss and learn from the experience so that it won't happen again. Get a Hardware wallet and keep the 12-24 words seed safe. Do not disclose your seed to anyone, keep the seed "analogic" and air gapped from any computer/printer/...
2. If they are still on your original adress, you have to check if you can find back the private key you've used to generate that wallet.
\- did you already transfered BTC from that adress to another adress to purchasse good or service? (just a check that you did actually controlled that adress in the past)
do not disclose any details or hint about your seed/private key. Your seed/private key is your access to your BTC. If someone else got those details they can (and most probably will) sweep the whole content of your wallet.
Stay safe.

Two of my banks provide all services for free (internet account). Interest rate on savings account is almost non existing but it’s something. As you said, said banks is also ready to loan me some money for purchasing a house let’s say.
My ledger Nano S currently doesn’t give me any of those services for free.
And the fiat value of the BTC I’m holding is decreasing over time. Yes 1 BTC is 1 BTC but if it’s worth less over time it’s not something I’m willing to continue pouring fresh money in at the moment.
It’s only since it’s not a significant amount of money beside my traditional portfolio that I haven’t sold yet, but investor with real skin in the game might not be enclined to hodl through a long/severe dip.
If you have all you saving in BTC or you are purchasing BTC with credit, you are Not as smart as you think you are and I think that a bank wouldn’t like to have a customer bailing on them for purchasing crypto.
This is a bear market and it might take a couple of years or more to go up and that’s if it will go up, just be prepared to loose a lot of money or to loose it all. Nothing is guarantee that there will be a market reversal above your entry point.
Edit: for international wire for business reason, if you would like to do it the bank way, a phone call and discussion with the bank about how to proceed sending the funds would have saved the guy in the article much headache. Unfreezing the funds because the wire didn’t get through from Chile to UK is indeed harder than whitelisting you before the wire.
That or sending the funds with crypto. But then, you have to register with an exchange to acquire the token (on-ramp to crypto), you customer has to register to an exchange as well (off-ramp to crypto). Both of you have to enter this as capital gain/loss following the particular set of taxlaw of your respective country concerning crypto assets. If you are not doing it the right way, you doing exactly what the bank is suspecting you to do : tax evasion, money laundering, ...  it with crypto assets instead of fiat.
International wire or international crypto payement  are both complicated matter if you would like to do it the right way.

At the moment, the way the PoW algorithm is implemented and as described in the white paper, there is a finite supply of BTC to be ever created by design and intended purpose. If you want to implement your change, you can always postulate your vision of what BTC should be in your eyes. 
If you are set to continue generating BTC indefinitely like you wish to with your proposed change, you are basically proposing an infinite supply of bitcoin however slow it may be. I doubt you will get a majority of node to switch to your branch but you can indeed implement your change but not on the main branch without all node agreeing with your change.

Hello there, 
I've been accumulating some fraction of BTC (just a bit above 0.1BTC) little by little renting my GPUs time on Nicehash.
In my area (Belgium), there is a possibility to use BTC for purchasing delivery food. I've been wanting to pull the trigger on a large Hawaii Pizza delivery just to have a feel that I'm using my BTC and not just Hodling. But don't want to be THAT pizza guy. That kinda summarize my BTC experience at the moment. Since the value of the BTC is dropping, the amount of pizza I would be able to buy is constantly dropping. FOMO or Pizza?
I don't think that the BTC value of a pizza worth today 15 euro will ever pay me a lambo in the future, but at the same time I just could use fiat to pay the pizza and keep hodling and see what the future bring.

You have nothing on Robinhood, sell it all and buy the same amount on an exchange you can send the same amount of BTC to a wallet you control the key.

Well, if the BTC coming from the Binance hack were to come back to Binance after a few amount of transaction, would Binance try to hold the funds until investigation would determine that customer isn’t in fact the hacker trying to wash the stolen coins?

You mentionned it, he could join a pool and receive a fraction of each block reward the pool found.
He isn’t obliged to join the biggest pool, he has to join a pool big enough to have regular payout.
You should know that a SHA-256 miner used to mine bitcoin will suck a lot of electricity. A S9 is around 1300 Watts I believe for example. And that is supposed to run 24/7/365. A little bit of extra solar will not help much.
Also mining bitcoin at the moment isn’t profitable at all unless free electricity.
Solar isn’t free electricity. You could choose to inject the extra solar back to the grid and have a electricity rebate (your teller might be able to turn back) that would be more productive financially and you could spend some money to purchase bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2018-12-12 04:47:58
You don’t have bitcoin yourself, all the bitcoins are on the public ledger. The public ledger is copied several time on the network nodes. What you can have is a private key associated to a public address that has received some bitcoin (through mining or purchasing bitcoin).
You don’t have bitcoins in cold storage, you are isolating a private key from the network to prevent hacking. (E.g. paper wallet, air gapped computer, ...)

Exactly, if you’re out of a job or struggle financially you’ll have a hard time not liquidating cryptoasset first to stay solvent and continue to pay your mortgage as your first priority.
If however you are doing better than most people and are safe financially in time of trouble, you could invest then when the market is depressed.

Exchanges will surely increase the amount of confirmation if the value/hashrate is too tempting to make such a reorg

Why would mining end? Even after the coin issuance would be 0 wich it would not be in our lifetime, the transaction fee would still encourage the miners of tommorow to continue hashing away to keep confirming new transactions.
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:36:17
Miner will mine at the difficulty they can afford to continue mining on :-) they follow price. It’s just that now let’s say you had 3 generation of mining hardwRe being profitable during the bull run. Now you have only the latest generation being profitable at the current price and cheap electricity rate.
You shelf the second gen and you sell the third gen by the weight.
If price is going up, you have the second gen that can immediately get online at the flick of a switch. So this time around the hashrate will be able to follow a surge in price much faster than last year when it took 6 month for the hashrate to converge to the overinflated price of the market. (Beside miners that have expensive electricity and second gen hardware and that are already banckrupted)

@_date: 2018-12-06 10:16:24
To each at their own scale :-)
I personally have other priorities short terms, so I’m buying crypto with no more than 5% of my monthly salary each month.
Then I put a limit buy order at a low level hoping for it to fill in (so yes, hoping BTC will go down at least momentarily so I can get some as low as possible).
BTC is down maybe 50% from all I’ve put it in since January but it would have been worse if I went balls deep in of those fake dip since January.
So yeah, I started buying small amounts regularly after ATH, but that’s because I’m buying after ATH that I have to be cautious. People that have bough previously to the ATH and are still up from their mean purchase price and good on them if they did
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:37:27
You can first answer to the question: how much are you paying per kw/h?
Be sure to take into account every hidden costs and taxes. Then look up one of the plenty online calculator to see if you could run Whatever ASIC is the best one at the moment.
From personnal experience, unless you have free electricity, buy BTC at today’s price with the fiat cost of the best ASIC rig you can find today.

Bitcoin will become worthless right there and then.
Everyone as a price. That kind of money is impossible to humanely hold on to.

2016 blocks, 
It doesn’t guarantee a comeback if the only miners lefts are the ones in a region of low cost of electricity and labor with the latest tech.
Hashrate follow price, not vice versa.

You don’t hack SHA-256 by finding a nonce that is acceptable enough in regard with current difficulty.
 Wich is what miners are doing.
If you want to hack a private key associated to a public address, you have to hack it exactly.

You end up with less miner with more BTC each. There is a predictable amount of BTC being minted no matter how much miner are put at the task. So you still have a constant flow of BTC reaching the market.

I’m just saying that they are doing it multiple time :-) If we consider that HFT and arbitrage always existed to the current scale, there is indeed a huge increase of volume.
But I think there is an increase also in frequency of those trades. Not everyone buy and hodl.

You could get more bitcoin by spending the rebate on extra electricity sent back to the grid on purchasing Bitcoin.
Unless you want anonymous coins, purchasing is often the best way to get bitcoin at this moment.
You’ll get also much more bitcoin in one shot.
I’m also assuming OP doesn’t have the hardware yet. That is a sunk cost he has to breakeven with first before making a profit. He’ll never break even.

It depend, we are not all equal in terms of electricity rates and how far our rigs are amortized or not.
If you need to buy a rig now, even with free electricity you might have difficulty to just breakeven the purchase price of the rig. Making money out of it is a distant dream.
If you already broke even on the purchase of the rig and it is still efficient enough at your cost of electricity, then it make sense but that’s it.

Eventually yes for the operation with the lowest costs of electricity and labor and with the latest tech.
Those operation also have to remain solvent until then, a lot of mining operation kickstarted with a loan. If they can’t repay the downpayement they’ll be bankrupted even if their oparation is not in the red yet and have ran out of liquidity.
