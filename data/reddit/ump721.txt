I'm running my personal web server off Linode, would someone in a situation like me be a good candidate for running a node?
What are the potential downsides? (High traffic / CPU / RAM / disk space, and so on)

To those downvoting, "/s" is for "end sarcasm". Meaning that everything said before it was sarcastic.

I use 1Password for this and I love it. Plus I always have it since it's synced across all my devices!

Ah, good ol' Bancorp. I'm guessing you also use Simple.com? ;)

In the United States a jury is picked specifically so the people on it don't have opinions or knowledge of the subject being debated. It's the job of the prosecution and defense to use witnesses and experts to then teach the jury. In this way the jury can be more objective.
I have no idea if this actually works, but that's the reason you see so many "clueless" juries.

Man, the answers they're looking for on a lot of those jobs are extremely subjective. Plus the "trial mode" feels more like "hey, do these 30 jobs for no points while we collect data from you".

I'm not making it up: 
I've manually changed it to 0.0005 BTC but you can see that it still "suggests" the 0.01

Ah! Good to know. The Bitcoin-Qt app says "Fee 0.01 recommended" which felt kind of high to me. Then again, I currently only have half of that :)

Awesome, thanks for the info.
My "Bitcoin fortune" is extremely small, but for the sake of example let's say I have 100 BTC. When you talk about a "savings wallet" are you talking about an ewallet? I'm just imagining my apartment burning down with all my wallets inside. It would be the equivalent of keeping all my USD in my mattress.
I'll look into that Electrum client. It would be nice to know that if my home computer blew up I could still access my funds via another device with the same "account" so to speak.
