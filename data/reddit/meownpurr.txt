Kraken or Bitstamp don't offer Liqpay or any credit card system.. Bank wires are the devil
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:25:03
Coinjar is too expensive, why the hell do you think I started dealing with BTC-E in the first place?
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:56:30
I already have, those dickheads don't reply, they are too busy not running their own shit business. I have tried their ICQ and they did the same thing on that, repeating the same sentence 20 times... they are intentionally doing that
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:17:32
Are you seriously starting this conversation with your keyboard in attack mode? C'mon dude, Obviously I didn't know that it was a fake ID, that's why I posted this in the first place. Also, nothing can be done with a deposit ID, Order ID or Payeer ID.. Please just stop wasting my time
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:35:55
I've heard better things about MT.GOX than BTC-E...  You can be one of two things, cheap and dodgy or honest and expensive.. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:20:51
How do you know I DID THAT? OH MY GOD, this guy has explained every step I took in finding this contact information, could you please tell me about my future love life?
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:44:15
And charge me for what? For being a meanie? Funnily enough, Your argument would never hold up in court.. 
It's also funny that I still haven't taken this post down.. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:36:52
HAHAHA, at least peggy answers calls...
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:43:15
If I fell for this crap, I would have lost 2 BTC by now.. you idiot. Although, that's funny you mention that because I really did receive quite a bit of money from my Indian uncle
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:27:31
There you go Carrot Man, a perfect example of your ignorance.. That's completely pathetic
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:07:10
Yeah, I already called my bank up and they are going to dispute it, thank god I didn't send in a bank wire... They are almost impossible to get back. The thing is, they're usually not according to the mass population but there has been the odd scam and rude support every now and then.... it's too much to trust my money in their hands
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:43:32
Yeah? They were doing this on ICQ as well, explain that.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:22:06
You are the perfect example of a moron, there are no bit coin  gates to guard my friend
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:29:05
I thought only one Skype ID can be linked to an email address at one time.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:25:33
Hey chilllll bro
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:59:21
1+, you deserve a medal
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:54:17
If you are having so much trouble, I can screenshot it for you right now
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:27:22
Thanks for the support wdrwdr 1+
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:10:40
I'm pretty sure that very soon, quite a few of them are going to weigh up the pros/cons and decide to bail... with quite a bit of money.. I'm not implying anything, but lets just say I'm implying something
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:41:10
thanks, could you please do that for me? that would mean the world... here are my details
my credit card number is 5598-9083-go-f**k-yourself
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:10:33
Virwox charges 20 percent above market price, they are a rip off, I used them when I was a noob, now I would never pay for that price. The closest I can get is localbitcoins
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:06:27
No.. there have been multiple incidents with multiple people.. the only reason I am using them is because their bit coins are instant. Every other f**king place has "BANK WIRE" which take 22 days sometimes to clear
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:31:19
shut up satoshi before i feed you pufferfish
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:32:47
I thought only one Skype ID can be linked to an email address at one time. That's where I went wrong... I thought that would have been common sense for Skype to do..
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:56:03
Even if they didn't talk to me on Skype, there are multiple instances that are the exactly the same as mine with so so many different people. BTC-E are selective scammers
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:30:49
People keep defending them like its their practiced religion... like they go to btc-e church every sunday.. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:22:57
Dude, I used their official support email on their website to search their Skype... support
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:50:41
It's completely f**ked up... i'm lucky it was just 300 bucks and not 3000
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:48:54
Sorry, the key word you used is "always." If you literally meant always and not just theoretically then I'm pretty sure you cannot speak for the thousands of people who use this service, YOU are stating that 100% of transactions have been successful which is basically not true with everything that has been said of BTC-E. I have not said that everybody gets scammed, I have said there have been multiple. I have only stated that they are selectively scamming. I have used their proper channels and there is no way I am going to ask for help on their shitty excuse for a chat box. If this was tl;dr for you then shut the hell up and go watch red tube or something suited for your PROBABLE age (see what I did there?) 
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:09:44
You're probably right but the same exact thing is happening on the ICQ towards me.. this is expected from them.. it's my fault for even trying to buy bit coins from this exchange
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:23:25
I already have tried their twitter account, nothing.. all I got on their support site was, and I quote, "contact payer support!!!!!!"
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:52:45
I'm not in the USA and you need a US bank account, and their cards are only VISA...
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:21:42
What the hell are you talking about, I didn't get scammed from any malicious party.. I got scammed from the BTC-E website. You just contradicted yourself by stating that BTC-E were operating pretty alright and then call them a malicious party. BTC-E is where I got scammed, again, it's people like you who listen to the book and believe in every word and defend to the death, regardless if you are wrong or not. Why should I take it down? People are allowed to have their opinions, I'm not ashamed in admitting that I can be wrong
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:54:56
It's like the most illegitimate exchange I've encountered in my life, I need a better place, I'm never buying from here again
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:52:55
That is like saying that Sheep Marketplace or Tormarket weren't going to close their "gravy train".. to them the outcome is worth more if they bail than to stay and work for the profit. Also, I'm not standing in front of the freezer without anything to indicate that the food is rotten.. I'm standing in front of the freezer with my half eaten rotten sandwich that I just received from the kitchen lady
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:26:00
I already did that.. their response was "contact payeer support", mind you, this was said about 50 times to me with various questions I had for them
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:39:06
You're suggesting that their Skype ID AND ICQ are not real.. even though they have been plastered all over the net with accompanied solutions adjacent to them.. Majority rules and it's more than likely that you're the one that's wrong over 50 people who are right.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:25:15
Yes, exactly 1+.. they are selective scammers, which is very smart because in the end, their herd of bit coin warriors don't believe the other percentile and keep buying.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:02:31
I already have AIDS
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:42:28
It is almost impossible to buy bit coins instantly without being in the US.. i'm trying to sort out a method as we speak, liqpay is equally as bad
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:44:22
Possibly, you are probably right
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:57:52
aRe yOu a WiZarD?
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:37:17
Shut up you btc-e goblin
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:54:35
That is what I've been saying but apparently they have been "around for years" and they are a "legitimate business" who would not be stupid enough to bail now when they can make more profit.. I say no.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:12:27
I'm pretty sure you were talking about yourself
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:04:08
Oh no... sorry, I didn't realise that at all.. oh gosh jolly, thank-you, what would I have done without your input on this situation.
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:28:47
I clicked on multiple forums and sources and they said the same thing to me on ICQ that they did on their official support website.. I'm guessing you guys are right about the Skype ID though, I thought only one Skype ID can be linked to an email address at one time.
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:27:17
I specifically downloaded that program just to talk to them... apparently, they live in a underground cave.. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:21:09
Nope, its me also.. I'm trying to find an alternative to BTC-E, anyone but that business... it's giving me an OOOPS error
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:31:17
Right here
[Your screenshot, moron](
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:29:51
People keep defending them like its their practiced religion... like they go to btc-e church every sunday.. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:34:51
Yeah well, read above, it doesn't look like I was cheated... does it?
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:17:23
You are doing exactly what everybody else that uses btc-e religiously is doing, you stand by an exchange you know nothing about which is completely ignorant in my opinion. These people have no reason to lie about their experiences and when it is coming from all directions, it starts to get a little suspicious, doesn't it? Or are you too ignorant and naive that you think BTC-E wouldn't do that?
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:59:03
Thank-you! Somebody on here has common sense... if bit coins can do this to people, now I understand how bad religion is
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:41:01
And you are probably some 15 year old teenage kid who still plays WOW
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:33:14
+ Their methods of transfer take way too long
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:05:06
Their ICQ has said the same thing to me as their support website... Are they fake too?
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:11:46
Thanks for the long post, yeah, I already called the bank and talked to them for a while about it. It's lucky that I used a card and not bank wire, then I would have been in the shit hole by now. Do liqpay place a hold on your funds if it is a large deposit? I deposited two other times with no problems.. I called Payeer yesterday and they found the transaction to be "pending"
