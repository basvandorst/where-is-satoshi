So the max tax you pay on capital gains is 25% if you’ve held over a year? So far i’ve only bought bitcoins and haven’t traded it for alt or fiat and I don’t plan on spending any until it’s become something substantial. Does that mean if i do spend the coins it’ll be only a percentage taxed based on my fiat income?

Lol jeez, well looks like i’ll be saving as much as i can then~ thank you

Funny, but it’s probably bad that I understand bitcoin more than taxes
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:56:42
Okay thank goodness, trying to figure this out has been such a pain in the ass. Thank you so much
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:43:57
So i have to save enough fiat to pay for that, right?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:38:52
This is perfect! Exactly what i meant, thank you

How would my gain be calculated if i paid directly with bitcoin

So they’ll take my car to pay the taxes on the car? I don’t get the point then? What the use of having it if I can’t afford to spend it?

So if I understand correctly, if i just hodl my bitcoin and never trade it for fiat or alts its not taxable? What if in the future i use my bitcoins to buy something like for example a car, house, etc) what happens? I might need a ELI5

Alright, i think i got it, but I probably should hire a CPA because this shit goes over my head haha. For now though taxes aren’t an issue, so thank you
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:58:14
But how would i pay if don’t have the fiat to back it up?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:43:01
Yea basically this, but i haven’t found one that’s predicting

Is there a live updating chart anywhere that calculates what the price might be in a few months/years. Of course i know it wouldn’t be fully accurate, because it wouldn’t be able to take an account future dips and lulls, but it would be helpful

Does anyone think that in the future there will only be one major cryptocurrency or will BTC, ETH, and LTC (or more) all be able to coexist?

Did you find a good place to buy LTC? I wanted to buy but it seems impossible. I use Gemini because coinbase/gdax won’t verify me and bitstamp needs proof of residence which i don’t have
