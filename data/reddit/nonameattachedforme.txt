Lmao. That's some shit logic. My company sells shit but I can only make five/year in my factory. Possibly One billion demand. It's valuation? Easily 200B if not higher.

I'm not saying that bitcoin doesn't have potential but I look at it as a startup right now (in my eyes).
It has an insanely high valuation. It's young and hasn't been proven on a huge scale yet. It's just a lot of risk and very highly valued.. maybe it will become a standard sometime but that's just impossible to say right now and I swear this subreddit has a cult mentality by refusing to acknowledge anything against a $20k valuation of bitcoin and actually have a civil conversation about what the price will be next year or in ten years (maybe $20k, maybe $1k).. it's just not that predictable

Your reasoning was awful so I pointed it out with a similarly awful argument but I really doubt I'll get through to you so just invest all your money and I hope it 20x overnight

No it's not I'm just attempting to point out the clear poor reasoning of that statement

My thought is how can bitcoin be worth $100b and seemingly double in value every other month. I do think there's value but it's way too speculative and I don't think the current price reflects its real value right now

lmao apparently my analogy isn't getting across in this subreddit.

I agree it was bad and it was a sarcastic example of the poor analogy used to support the "limitless growth" of bitcoin
