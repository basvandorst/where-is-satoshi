It isn't until you try to contact Coinbase about an issue that you realise how truly powerless you are in the whole process. 
Then you get referred to parts of their terms and conditions to realise you are utterly fucked:
8.3. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL COINBASE, ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INTANGIBLE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH AUTHORIZED OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE COINBASE SITE OR THE COINBASE SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Wirex is fucking gold mate... Fucking gold
Pay anything with bitcoins using that shit. Also can keep your coin hedged to your domestic currency whilst they are on the card. Support get back to enquirers quick. Very much recommend.

They have no instant support or chat and are very selective about which issues they resolve in which order. If your issue is complicated you may wait a couple of weeks for a response.
Unlike other companies which promptly respond, people are working out the best way to get a response from Coinbase is to post on reddit.
I don't think it's trolls I think it's the absence of any reassurance or support when thousands of dollars of bitcoin go missing. People go nuts. That's why you see a lot of complaints.
Hell I'd actually get over the fact that coinbase act, as a company, as if they are the new paypal were they to provide the support to match.
Proof: E-mail them yourself with an issue or ask the "live support" monkeys a marginally difficult question.
Source: Coinbase never ever respond to any of my fucking issues.

I'm sorry, but, I disagree. I believe for the money that Coinbase make they should be able to provide SOME consistent customer service. Other foreign exchange providers have telephone numbers and promptly answer support queries, the only reason bitcoin is different is because they feel they can get away with it.
It's all very well not having a phone number, but, ignoring e-mails as well and locking user funds without explanations is indeed agonising for customers. We as consumers are accepting lower and lower qualities of service and it's simply not acceptable. You wouldn't accept this from your bank, or even from a currency exchange provider like travelex.co.uk
He's welcome to correct me if I'm wrong, but, the only reason I believe there isn't someone answering the phone 24/7 at CB is that it would be $100k/year in wages off of their very profitable bottom line and out of Brian's pocket.

Transfer from LBC to a Blockchain wallet then transfer immediately to end destination with your chosen fee.
No waiting for any confirmations, you can send from blockchain as soon as the transaction is broadcast from LBC
Not waiting for confirmations is why I use Blockchain wallet as a middle man to forward transactions with a chosen fee instantly
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:48:09
I would have thought the payment processor would pick up the transaction being broadcast and then given you an invoice, which is subject to confirmations. That's what most payment processors I deal with do. I also know coinbase merchant services do the same.

I hadn't thought about it from that perspective. When you think about it like that... these people really aren't save-able are they?
@_date: 2016-11-02 17:08:00
I'm contacted quite frequently by prospective onecoin investors after I left my details on an article in the mirror.
It takes pages of writing and hours to convince lots of these people and they are people who have contacted me with concerns!
If they're hard to convince, imagine those heavily invested and those who have received payouts and similarly re-invested... there's no saving them
The common theme is none of them have a clue about cryptocurrency and they are from countries around the world.
P.S. Really could use some help if anyone fancies helping responding to some concerned onecoin investors? I'm getting to the point where I simply can't reply anymore.

Posts like this everywhere mate, coinbase has a terrible reputation.
Very little you can do mate, if you actually look at their terms and conditions you're at their mercy. Fools game using coinbase:
8.3. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL COINBASE, ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INTANGIBLE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH AUTHORIZED OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE COINBASE SITE OR THE COINBASE SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Easy answer for you, but, I'm afraid you're going to drop 31 Euro on it:
For the ease and convenience of mobile wallet with the ultimate security of a hard wallet there is only one solution, ledger unplugged interfaced with Mycelium or Greenbits.
Got mine today and 110% satisfied, super easy, super secure:
If you are UK based, it's much more cost effective to buy using amazon and you get next day delivery as opposed to 3 weeks.

Grams is a good tumbler mate. 
Have you thought of uploading some videos or tutorials behind a paywall online? Allow donations/payment in Bitcoin. Allow the site to be accessed via tor. 
The rest practically writes itself.

All of the below are very good reasons that negatively affected the bitcoin price Early 2014. 
Less reported on and perhaps as important was the theft of £6.4million of BTC from Sheep Marketplace in December 2013. The recent arrest of those responsible revealed the stolen BTC was all dumped on the market between Dec2013 and April2014. 
Demand of BTC for illicit goods crashed and all the stolen BTC flooded marketplaces.
You won't find this reported anywhere, but, look up the events and it all matches the timeline perfectly.
If you include the below the timeline looks like this:
October 2013 - Mt Gox Collapse -
December 5th 2013 - China Bitcoin Ban -
December 2013 - Sheep Marketplace Theft -
December to April - Stolen Bitcoin floods marketplaces driving up supply

Typical coinbase. I think it's good these threads get made so people can know the risks of using coinbase.
I also think the lack of customer support there is unacceptable and has been for years.
