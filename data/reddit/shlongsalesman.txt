I went over there to try it out. I bought $10 worth and received .0149BTC in return.

It takes cash but the two guys running this whole shindig were standing right there. There are police officers inside South Station. If you're smashing things with a sledgehammer, someone is going to notice.

I used it about an hour ago and I think you can only purchase BTC.

I used the Liberty Teller ATM a couple of hours ago and am finally a Bitcoin owner, or at least a fraction of one. It was an overall great experience.
I have been interested in Bitcoin for a few months now but haven't pulled the trigger on actually acquiring Bitcoins. 
I saw someone tweet that this ATM was open at South Station today and that they were giving away 1-50 mBTC (I checked and my paper wallet didn't have anything preloaded but whatever). 
I hopped on the (T)rain and made my way over there. When I arrived, Kyle helped me through the process. I grabbed a paper wallet, inserted $10 into the ATM, scanned the QR code on my paper wallet, and received 0.0149BTC. He explained that I could follow the tutorials on their website to set up an online wallet. When I had my laptop in front of me, I used my private key to transfer the Bitcoins from my paper wallet to my online wallet and Voila! 
There is alot more that needs to be done but this is great first step. It makes becoming a Bitcoin owner extremely easy.

Like said, no ID needed. I wonder if they would let kids or teenagers (&lt;18) buy Bitcoins.
Fees: $10 USD gave me about $9.50 in BTC.
