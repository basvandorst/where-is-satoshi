What does it change if it's the people from the thread? Who else is going to upvote it to raise awareness? There's a list of useful altcoins and you can count it with ten fingers, darkcoin is on one of those fingers.

Weird that this is upvoted in Is it sarcasm? Doesn't look like sarcasm though. 
EDIT : NOT SARCASM CONFIRMED

BTW , the guy above has a personal vendetta against DRKcoin. He hasn't said a SINGLE good thing about it and is ALWAYS there to say something bad. Get a life?

You are spending so much time being a hater. There are so many coins out there to hate, you have a personal vendetta against drk. You are pathetic! :)

There are quite a few comments in here already but let me chime in. 
Vault of Satoshi have been great for me since the very start. I signed up at first and didn't take the time to verify, thinking it would take a long time. Not 24 hours after I had submitted my documents was my account ready. Clean interface and a very solid base on which they are adding features regularly. They started off the right way. I made a cash deposit to their banks account and tried calling to confirm. To my surprise I was greeted by someone within 2 pushes of a button. And the deposit was confirmed within an hour.
They truly gave me a sense of trust in their company and in bitcoin as well. Trust that was shattered for a lot of people yesterday in the Gox news. Their employees have names and it feels like dealing with humans. 
The bitcoin world can be cold and if we have to deal with centralized exchanges, they should be like VoS.
