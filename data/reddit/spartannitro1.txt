@_date: 2018-09-06 00:37:40
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:04:37
It's not low though, 6000$ is historically expensive for Bitcoin.

Yeah once ISIS starts hodling Bitcoin, they will stop bombing civilians and chopping people's heads off.

Yeah the embassy housing him cut off his internet access. Maybe he should step outside of the embassy and be tweet from the nearest Starbucks.

This is what this sub doesn't understand. Institutions have zero interest in Bitcoin or other cryptos.
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:37:25

No you can't.

Basic rule of crypto investing, don't share your holdings online ;)
@_date: 2018-09-12 12:51:14
Is there any proof that spending crypto for goods and services puts upward price pressure?

No bank is obligated to service him.

He's not a whistleblower though
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:30:16
Yes, a country with bad internet infrastructure should adopt crypto as their sole currency.
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:27:17
The nominal value doesn't matter if you're talking about a situation with runaway inflation since the price of goods goes up accordingly.

You buying a bag of chips with crypto has next to zero influence on the price of crypto moving up
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:28:53
The only way to acquire crypto is to either buy expensive mining rigs that destroy the environment or buying it. 
Not sure what your other point is. People make money from earning it.
@_date: 2018-09-12 12:15:23
Why would you spend it if you "know" it's going to make you set in a few years?
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:49:58
Like using the investment to make a tangible purchase, ie downpayment on a house, new car, good vacation, etc.
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:22:06
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:35:54
Price is also determined by demand.if no one is willing to buy your coin for $1, then the price eventually falls to it's fair market value.

Yes these guys are 100% legit
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:30:43
You're honestly just cherry picking dates. Someone who put a decent amount of capital back when it was trading at $200 and sold in December would be happy never coming back to crypto. Therein lies the issue. There's no reason to be invested in crypto other than speculating and hoping for a jackpot.

And moist!
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:25:12
You're being purposefully dense. How would you feel if your advisor told you to buy energy stocks in 2015 or tech in 2000. That's the point.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:47:47
Tether manipulation has diminishing returns. Eventually they'll collapse like Enron.
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:57:51
Yeah you could buy Bitcoin and watch your money drop just as much lol
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:44:12
The term fundamentals has a very specific meaning in the investment world and Bitcoin by definition has literally none.
@_date: 2018-09-12 12:32:56
Yeah but probably not
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:41:16
Agreed subs should never be allowed to ban anyone.

I looked at your post history and you are an ostrich!
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:46:02
When you'd like to put your investment to use, it does though.
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:23:11
You couldn't even understand my analogy with an advisor telling his clients to buy an asset that is about to crash. Maybe you should educate yourself a bit more about the investment world?
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:24:41
Probably not. He most likely made that up.
@_date: 2018-09-15 13:39:24
The S&amp;P dropped 50% in 2008. This was one of the worst bear markets ever for the stock market going back to the 1930s.
And yet it still doesn't even come close to how much the crypto markets seem to drop every 2 years, including this year.
@_date: 2018-09-12 12:23:46
That actually would be pretty bad advice in 2018.
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:19:33

You're right. The world was a peaceful paradise before inflation.
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:38:43
And crypto mining doesn't kill the planet?
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:21:35
Again, why do you think crypto ownership will become less unequal when the only way to acquire it is through expensive mining rigs or purchasing it with fiat (which you say itself is concentrated with the wealthy)
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:26:00
I don't really care about anecdotal evidence. Are there any actual studies that prove this?
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:03:38
Accredited investors don't typically put their money in speculative assets like crypto.
@_date: 2018-09-18 21:28:42

@_date: 2018-09-12 12:29:44
Ahh well that srta makes sense if you value BTC in terms of Venezuelan currency, but most people compare BTC to USD to get a more accurate representation of value.

USD is definitely scarce. If it wasn't, you'd find $20 bills discarded anywhere like cigarette butts.
You also forgot "liquidity" and "legal tender" of which USD is and crypto is definitely not.

@_date: 2018-08-13 16:14:56
Yes, that's the point and neither is Bitcoin. Sound money specifically refers to currencies backed by a commodity.
@_date: 2018-08-27 12:56:21
I don't get this community's fetish with currency devaluing. You realise that sometimes it can be helpful to have control over the value of your currency, right? For example, exports can become more attractive with a weaker currency. (See: China)

@_date: 2018-05-23 22:12:13
Yeah. Buying bitcoin is totally not about wanting to get a Lambo and laughing at wagecucks. It's about the technology maaaaan and giving your grandchildren Lambos.

@_date: 2018-08-13 17:52:41
Yikes! Hopefully when you grow up you'll realise that people don't really care about your personal opinions when you try to present a point as factual. Go look up the actual definition of what "sound money" is before calling other people names. It'll make you look less dumb.
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:56:29
These posts basically amount to "please catch this falling knife so that my failing investment recovers!"

So no one actually cares about hodling if you can get rich by selling? I totally thought you guys loved Bitcoin because of the technology.
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:27:33
The different here is that the X-ray and internet are useful.
@_date: 2018-05-16 12:52:44

Agreed, keep accumulating till you die!
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:26:41
Uhhhh  they actually have raised rates and are planning to further raise rates?
People are freaking out about the hikes because their mortage costs and credit card bills are about to go up.
@_date: 2018-08-29 17:16:47
Awful advice. Don't ruin your relationship with your parents over internet Monopoly money. When you're 18, do what ever you want (and accept the consequences). Until then, take their advice and try to understand where they're coming from.

@_date: 2018-05-17 11:09:45
See my other post below. Blaming inequality solely on low interest rates is fucking retarded. Permanently high rates would grind the economy to a halt - homes would become unaffordable and businesses would stop expanding.

@_date: 2018-08-02 19:12:23
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:25:22
Yeah and the Fed further hiking rates this year is going to put downward pressure on borrowing. It's the only possible logical response from the Fed at the tail end of the economic cycle. By all accounts, this is in response to one of the longest bull markets in modern history. 
I agree that inequality is a real issue, but the low interest rate environment over the past decade is far from the major cause of it. Rather, you should blame politicians who keep setting tax policy that favor the rich, diminishing union membership, baby boomers staying in the workforce, citizens united, the drug war, etc.
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:19:01

Yeah why should the local gym charge membership fees, they already make money by selling protein shakes!!
@_date: 2018-05-17 15:16:25
I'm not going to respond to everything you just wrote, but to your first point about housing being unaffordable in big cities - this is exactly why they are raising rates, to slow home purchases and slow property value growth. 
You provide literally zero sources to your claims, so honestly I'm not going to waste my time.
Here's my source: 
Wage growth is at an above trend pace and unemployment is at very low levels. By all indicators the economy is running at full capacity. Your feelings doesn't  change that.
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:21:08
Pffff why should I pay account fees for a branch down the street to hold my money!! They already make tons of money on commercial real estate lending done halfway across my state!!!!111
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:24:49
Not sure what your point is - I asked you to explain what you meant about "sound money" since it has a specific definition which Bitcoin or other cryptos don't even fit:




Bitcoin has significant weekly appreciation and depreciation in value and it isn't backed by gold. You basically made up your own definition of what you think sound money is.
Here's another definition:
Again, Bitcoin is neither backed by a commodity nor does it have any intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-08-28 12:47:43
Why not just post an actual Bloomberg article instead of "nodez.co"
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:19:06
Don't you get charged transaction fees when sending crypto?

Brother I 100% agree with you that Equifax is a scumbag company and the people responsible for not securing consumer data need to be fined, jailed or both. The thing is, it is in stances like these that we need institutions like the CFPB to actually do their job. They need to actually go on the offensive against banking institutions and credit bureaus that don't protect consumer data.  Instead it's being run by a corrupt lackey of the banking industry.
Basically what you are suggesting is that we shouldn't trust farmgrown food because sometimes there are disease outbreaks, salmonella, etc. You say "well if everyone grew their own food in their backyard no one would be risk from industrial farming" when the real answer is farms that don't follow food safety protocols need to be punished harder in order for them to get the message and the bad behaviour to stop. Home grown food may work in some cases, but not all... kinda like Bitcoin. 
Not everyone is able to be their own bank. I mean just look at this sub. People lose their password all the time.  Imagine that on a massive scale? What would happen in cases of inheritance when a crypto holder dies and the next-of-kin is fucked because the holder put all of his investment assets in crypto and never bothered to share the password. What about another potential MtGox incident. See what I mean? 
Bitcoin is still only a niche product that doesn't suit every situation and every person.

That's such a wild oversimplication of the facts. Increasing wealth disparity can be blamed on anything from a federal minimum wage that hasn't increased in over a decade, diminishing union membership, baby boomers staying in the workforce longer, etc. Blaming inequality solely on low interest rates is ridiculous. Just think of it like this: if you had permanent high interest rates, job growth would grind to a halt, house prices would fall, and all credit costs would increase on consumers preventing them from pursuing their interests (starting a small business, getting a mortgage for their home, etc.)
Also, pro tip: there's nothing stopping you from buying stocks and benefiting from these buybacks.

I can already use my credit card for all of my internet transactions. If a vendor is fraudulent, I can call my bank to reverse the charges.  If I lose my card, I can call my bank and order a new one. If someone clones my card, I can call my bank and they will reverse any charges and send me a new card. I get rewards points any time I make payments on my card (about 300-400$ annually).

This is entirely contrary to the facts. Wage growth is starting to pick up and unemployment is very low right now.

Yeah and my point is that you substitute large (expensive) property for smaller (yet still expensive) property. Yes, price per square foot is still expensive but you're buying less of it for the same outcome (a living place). 
We're going a but too deep with the analogy here, but historically people have substituted core assets when need be. Construction companies used to build tall buildings in stone as it was readily available and not too costly.  Eventually, this was switched to glass and metal frames and this proved much more cost efficient. 
When bitcoin becomes too scarce and/or costly for the benefit it produces, this same substitution phenomenon will occur.

Wow, so much ignorance in this title where do I even start. Interest rates were lowered during the 2008 economic crisis to maintain the economy afloat. If businesses aren't taking out loans, it's  generally not a good sign. The Fed interest rate was maintained low in order to keep the recovery going and encourage lending. The Fed has recently started raising rates in order to prevent runaway inflation. Funny how this was not acknowledged by this random Twitter idiot.

You're right, I used to work at a bank (and yeah it kinda sucks, that's why I went back to university to get a second degree in a different field). Most of the limits and holds are in place for reasons that become really obvious when you actually work in the field. From my experience, in many instances the new account holders who were the most interested in talking about holds where people who who would later commit some sort of fraud. Otherwise, yeah if you've been with the same bank for 10 years or what ever and you find the holds annoying just ask a teller to raise them to the maximum amount (usually it's around $10k). I just hope that you don't get your debit card cloned and see your account emptied by som fraudster, which can be a huge pain in the ass.
Whether you like it or not banks are always going to exist, at least for our lifetimes. People will always need mortgages, a place to deposit their pay, and a credit card with a sweet cashback deal. Bitcoin provides an interesting alternative to payment solutions, but not to a lot of other functions that are done quite efficiently by big banking institutions.

Uhhhhh my comment was specifically in reply to your claim that a bank "owns" your money, which is completely false. Seriously, just look at any bank's quarterly financial statement. Your money is considered a liability, not an asset.
I'm not going to reply to all of your irrelevant comments, but a couple of things: banks generally put holds so that when you're depositing the check (1) that the issuing account actually has funds available and (2) to avoid fraud. Did you know that you can actually get cash immediately available from a check deposit? It's called "cashback". Literally just go to your bank teller and tell them you want to raise your cashback limit and you'll be able to withdraw cash immediately from a check deposit.
Also ATMs don't just magically shut down on Sundays by the way. Not sure what that comment was about.

If you think someone is evil simply because he edited posts on a privately owned forum, then your moral compass is questionable.
I'm really not sure what point you're trying to make. Reddit is a social media platform. When someone posts on Reddit and says that's dogs are more cool than cats, they're not speaking for Reddit corporate. Just as much as when you post that the Cleveland Browns suck on Facebook then that is not you speaking on behalf of Mark Zuckerberg. This should be self-evident.

@_date: 2018-10-23 21:35:59


Maybe you missed the point that these aren't "open platforms". These platforms are privately owned and they can ban whoever they want.
Kinda like a bakery that doesn't want to bake cakes for gay couples.

See, once again you're mixing in your personal beliefs in what you think Reddit standards. Can you provide any quotes from spez that he claims that Reddit is "neutral"? I mean for instance they've banned tons of subs now (and not necessarily content that is illegal) so this shows that they are not neutral.

Let me ask you a question: when you go to a currency exchange shop at the airport and want to convert 15 euros into 20 dollars, does it matter if they give you four 5-dollar bills or one 20-dollar bill? No, it doesn't. The end result is the same.

Oh, is your strategy to attack education now?

Oh well. Bruh that's what happens when you want to be your own bank.

And this right here folks is when you know you need to get the fuck out of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:28:52
Really easy for you to say "let the system collapse" when you're a programmer where most programmers make upper middle class salaries, have lots of upward mobility and have terrific benefits. A lot of people out there would love to be in your situation where insead currently they can barely feed their family ... Let alone invest in some sort of speculative crypto scheme.
@_date: 2018-06-25 22:39:30

Wow what a misleading title. If anyone bothered to read the ING quote, they'd see it said one ING behavioral scientist thought that crypto ownership could double "in the future, although we do not know when", not "soon" as this title suggests.

My credit card was cloned a few weeks ago and the fucker spent close to $2500 on my account before I actually realised what was going on. I called my bank and the charges were reversed within 3 business days.
If crypto can't offer me that same level of convenience and responsiveness to fraud then I will never switch over.
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:41:24
This is what they don't get. Their mentality of "bro, just hold Bitcoin to get rich" applied at a macro scale translates to the economy grinding to a halt - meaning loss of jobs, recession, and poverty. It's like telling someone that going to the casino and playing the slot machines is a viable retirement strategy.

@_date: 2018-06-27 02:24:08
I don't get what the point of this post is. Everyone already knows what Bitcoin did in the past in terms of price appreciation. It's just that past results cannot guarantee future performance.
@_date: 2018-06-24 02:48:48
????? Share buybacks have nothing to do with dividends and also has nothing to do with whether a company thinks their own share price is undervalued. Where did you get that idea?

Yes, in the past it has.
@_date: 2018-06-21 12:32:11
Economists are always talking about impending risks. It's their job. No one has a crystal ball that can predict flash crashes like 1987, but they are always talking about macro risk that can lead to environment where a "Black Monday" is possible.

@_date: 2018-06-26 21:21:34
Fair enough. I agree with people throwing around the word censorship way too much when there are a lot of places on this world that simply expressing your opinion (which is obviously terrible). I meant more along the lines that there are way too many subs on Reddit that simply delete any and all comments that go against the grain, so to speak.
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:07:54
Hey, completely unrelated but you guys are actually a pretty good mod team. I'm very anti-crypto but not once have I ever been censored on this sub for expressing myself. While we probably have different views on the state of crypto and where it's headed, it's cool to know you guys will not end discussion from people on the opposite end of the spectrum. (Unlike some subs on this site regularly do)

How can I get paid to shit talk Bitcoin and crypto more generally since I'd do it anyway for free?
@_date: 2018-06-21 13:37:16
Yes and [here]( is a link to economists that warned about severe market risks in 2008. The difference between them and you is that they have the educational context to make an informed opinion.
For example, you can "predict" that it will rain today because yo see lots of clouds in the sky, but a meteorologist will be able to give you a more scientific assessment based on weather patterns, etc.
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:26:57

@_date: 2019-02-04 22:38:01

@_date: 2019-02-14 23:04:27
Counterpoint: healthcare and education are significantly more expensive in the US specifically because everything is privately run and significantly less regulated. Sure you post less in taxes, but then significantly more in premiums in a broken system like the ACA. 
Maybe we just disagree, but single payer and subsidized higher education just make so much more sense to me. I don't know what the perfectly solution looks like, but it feels wrong to me to burden people with debt for simply wanting to be healthy.

@_date: 2019-02-04 22:54:02
That's not the definition of deflationary though. You can't just say that it's deflationary because it's going to be harder to mine. That doesn't make any sense. It's exponentially harder to mine today than it was 5 years ago.
Bitcoin will be inflationary for the rest of our lifetimes and the ROI for mining will continue to decrease, eventually making it a pointless venture (although some will still do it, obviously).

With how much crypto is manipulated, shorts get called all the time. It's not about "easy money" or some other gimmick. It's about not trying to short an asset that can easily be pumped and dumped by Tether fraud or other malicious actors in an unregulated environment.

"Nazism is the ideology and practices associated with the Nazi Party – officially the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or NSDAP) – in Nazi Germany, and of other **far-right** groups with similar aims."
"Nazism is a form of fascism and showed that ideology's **disdain for liberal democracy** and the parliamentary system, but also incorporated fervent antisemitism, scientific racism, and eugenics into its creed. Its extreme nationalism came from Pan-Germanism and the Völkisch movementprominent in the German nationalism"

Religious beliefs are protected by the Constitution and freedom of religion includes being able to express it. Part of expressing it for some people is (unfortunately) being against homosexuality. If you're a hardcore Christian professional painter and someone asks you to paint a gay rights commission (say a giant rainbow or wtv) are you forced to take the job? Of course not because it's against your religious beliefs, which again is protected by the Constitution. Is it discriminatory? Maybe? But it's what the Constitution expressly protects.
You're asking me what I think is right and wrong. Do I think it's awful that the Westboro Baptist Church protests at dead soldiers' funerals? Obviously. But yet it's still their right to do so under the current wording of the Constitution.

I just told you that I agree with the court's assessment and I don't think that the civil rights act needs to be expanded upon. Gays aren't a protected class and people can deny them service based on their fucked up religious beliefs. But society also has a right to shame that business and not associate or do business with its owners.

If you're referring to this


Then it's absolutely incorrect. Again, look over my list. Those companies have never paid dividends. Investors bought them for their growth potential, not for the hope of eventually earning dividends.

Honestly, what's the point of this when most of the trading volume is Tether fraud?
@_date: 2019-01-15 21:54:38
Your list doesn't make much sense. As a finance professional, here would be the correct list:
1. Dividends
2. Capital gains sale
3. Buyout at a premium
Buyouts are rare and typically only involve small companies (which generally don't give out dividends anyway). These buyouts can be very profitable for the investor, but are pretty hard to predict.
Here's a small list I've compiled of stocks that don't currently pay out dividends:
- eBay
- salesforce.com
- Amazon
- Adobe
- Autodesk
- Tesla
- Netflix
- Alibaba
- Google
- PayPal
Sure, dividends are nice to have. But just look at the list of stocks above: these stocks would have been AMAZING holds over the past ten years. Holding these stocks during that period would allow you now to make a nice downpayment on a house or some other big purchase. That's why I said in my initial comment that dividends are sometimes overrated because high-growth companies prefer allocating capital to future investments, rather than paying it out to investors who always want to see increases in yield.

Yes, the deposit insurance system is designed to give depositors insurance. Obviously, the system collapses if everyone claims the maximum amount. But...
-Most of the population does not have $100,000 sitting in a chequing account.
-Imagine everyone with car insurance wanting to make a gigantic claim all at the same time. The insurance companies would never be able to pay. That's how insurance works.
-Deposit insurance is meant to stop runs on the bank. In the US it has been 100% successful since its creation going back several decades.

No, what you're suggesting is that payment businesses shouldn't be allowed to have their own rights and instead be obligated to service everyone.

The fed only controls money supply through credit and reserve ratios. It interacts directly with the commercial banks in doing so. Also has a significant control over inflation through interest rate setting. The Fed has absolutely nothing to "a central banker in a suit punching numbers into a computer just because he feels like it." 
The Fed quite literally has NO control over the printing of money. This is entirely the responsibility of the Treasury and its sub groups.

Or you can realize how the Kochs consistently fund a particularly awful political agenda. Me buying a phone or a computer is not supporting some political agenda.
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:57:33
That doesn't make any sense
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:56:05
Let me know when you're buying so I can dump on you

The FDIC does not insure retirement accounts, genius

Rubin is full of shit and a liar. Learn Liberty is a creation of the Institute for Humane Studies, where Charles Koch himself is a board member.

Notice how you said **bank** account?
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:39:44
So what you're saying is that when there's a bank robery you have to ignore the getaway driver. 
Just think this through a little and then come back.

You didn't even address my points. Money laundering allows criminals to further enrich themselves and commits further crimes. This is especially true for cartels and other organised crime groups that funnel their ill-gotten gains through legitimate businesses in order to mask the criminal origins of the money.

Have you even read my other comments in this thread?
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:59:40
Why do you *need* to give your hard-earned money to this guy anyway?
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:07:10
Hello everyone, how do you launder money through Bitcoin???? Need to buy some totally legal street fentanyl.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:50:58
Yeah buddy we're not flying an enhanced version of the Wright Brothers plane, its a completely different vehicle. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:44:38
He's a tool
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:08:03
This is good for Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:18:46
What kind of retarded comment is this
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:28:30
I should! I've abandoned Patreon and now accept Bitcoin - pay me, everyone!
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:15:00
And then everyone chuckled
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:01:02
You're saying people who don't own Bitcoin don't even have $300 saved up? What lol?
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:06:06
This whole post is FUD. Rubin hasn't in any way abandoned Patreon. In fact, as of today he has over [3000 patrons]( Really don't know why OP is trying to shill him on this sub.

Money laundering acts as a facilitator to the crime and it also gives criminals the ability to commit further crimes. Ever heard of financial institutions having to do KYC checks? This is exactly why. I mean you can do the research yourself as to why money laundering is bad instead of wasting people's time here.

"Bitcoin is rat poison" - literally Warren Buffet
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:16:24
I mean just look at his [1980 campaign]( where he vows to eliminate Medicare, Social Security, campaign finance laws, repeal ALL taxation, minimum wage laws, abolition of the EPA, DOE, FAA, FDA, and DOT. Eliminating seat belt, air bag, and motorcycle helmet requirements among his other ridiculous campaign promises. Oh and privatization of all water management.
The guy is absolutely insane.
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:24:29
Yes, he's a shill for the Kochs. Sorry that this is surprising for you. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:11:48
What did he actually say that hasn't been talked about ad nauseum on this sub since forever?
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:25:39
How the fuck are you in the early stages of something if it has existed for almost ten years?
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:45:17
Ah ok so there's really no reason to spend Bitcoin if we believe it will go up, right?
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:53:04
99.9% of people who watch Dave Rubin already were aware of Bitcoin's existence. This changes literally nothing.
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:55:44
What? Bitcoin literally has no fundamentals. There's no balance sheet or employees or earnings or dividends. It's just a speculative asset where you hope the next guy will pay more than you did.
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:12:05
You guys are so pessimistic. Bitcoin is going to reach $27 trillion by 2020 or I cut off my hair.
