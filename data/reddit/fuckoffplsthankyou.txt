Before I ever bought any, I thought long and hard about how best to weather the *inevitable* opposition to bitcoin from the powers that be.  There are a lot of people who feel that they need to work within the system, pay their taxes, get the banks to accept it, etc.  My point was that the system is woefully obsolete and that the tools to bypass and disregard their attempts to stifle this innovation are already ours.

The founders made it quite clear, in my view. As I stated, the Constitution is clear enough that a literate high school student can properly interpret it.  Some of us don't need politicians and courts to tell us what "keep and bear" and "shall not be infringed" means.


Any weapon that a standard infantry solder can carry.  As they don't carry nukes, it's not standard issue.  That was the point.  I'm surprised you missed it.   
Grenades, RPGs, fully automatic weapons, etc, are all covered under the 2nd, in my book.


What's the difference? Both are arms and both are needed.  If you try to be slimy and restrict one and not the other, you are still going against the intent of the 2nd.


Oh really?  You think the founders said that the People can have guns but not ammo?  If so, I'm reassessing my "brainwashed" comment I took back earlier.


Well, since only one has, it does tend to make that one stand out.  Esp when that one has a very long track record backing it up and the others don't.

When the US Citizens are fed misinformation, when their news is manipulated, when the vested interests make sure that the choice is always the shinest of two turds, yes they do elect bad leaders time and again.


In a truly free market, when the govt actually listens to the people, then yes, I would be interested in seeing what happens.  Chomsky once said that the polls regarding what the People want vs what the govt wants, they are almost always polar opposites.  The people don't want gun control, the govt does.  The people didn't want the Iraq war, the govt does.  The people don't want Keystone but I bet they'll get it.

Aw, thanks.  We can agree to disagree civilly. :)


Well....kinda yea.  It's better than the current clown who is in who has shown he doesn't, no?


Fair enough, I take back the "brainwashed" comment.  I just don't understand why anyone would pick someone who has demonstrated that they couldn't care less about the Constitution (Obama/Romney) over someone who has a track record of following it (Paul).


The Constitution was written so that a high school student could understand it.  "Shall not be infringed" is quite clear, for example.  In fact, I think all of the original 10 were quite clear in their meaning, even 200 years later.  It's only the politicians and the courts who try to split hairs and obscure the original intent. 


The founders stated that if future generations were to have a dispute regarding the intent and meaning of the words, to interpret them according to the intent of the people who wrote them. 


No, it means she chooses to disregard the 2nd Amendment and views personal gun ownership as "barbaric" in her words.


It means the People have a right to keep and bear arms and that right shall not be infringed.




Whatever the infantry of the armed forces at the time is equipped with.


If we give them to solders, than yes.  You should be able to own a tank as well, which you can.  Full auto, 30 round magazines, the whole 9.


The citizens of the United States.


I have no problem with that.


Every citizen should be as well equipped as any infantry solder.  If we ever get to the point where we have mini nukes and our infantry comes with one standard for soldiers, the citizens should have them too.  Any weapon you can name, if it's standard issue for our armed forces, our citizens should be equipped with the same.


I disagree.  There are people who advocate "well, you can have the rifle, but nobody said anything about the ammunition."  This is someone who is going against the 2nd Amendment.


Well, Jill Stein specifically stated that personal gun ownership was barbaric, so yes, she definitely interpreted differently than I do.  
In addition, I don't remember her stating her determination to defend the Constitution, regardless of how she feels about certain amendments, so for that, Ron Paul got my vote.

Using cash means you have to physically be there.  You have to go to the store where the buttplug is sold, the salespeople can be queried later as to your appearence (Have you seen any blah blah blah guys who look like this buy any products recently?), the store may or may not have video surveillance, etc.


Granted.  Now try to pin any transaction on the blockchain to me.  There's no record of me ever buying bitcoins.  I don't use exchanges.  I use tor for every transaction. 


They would have to be able to tie you to the wallet first.  I know I've taken serious steps to prevent that from happening, I can't speak for anyone else.
 &gt; If I have to launder/tumble my money before I hand it over to the emporium, I have to first of all actually do that in the first place whereas I don't with cash or debit card
Yes, I agree, keeping your actions private in this day and age requires some effort.  Not a great deal of effort in my view, but yes, you do have to think.


I haven't heard of any major trust issues regarding tumblers.  I am quite sure that any tumbler that didn't give you the right amount of money back would suffer a loss of business.


Here is a good example of the chilling effect of govt surveillance.


Now, me, I would just say "What is a bitcoin?" and leave the burden of proof on them.




I disagree.  There are tools such as Tor that can be leveraged and I very very highly doubt anyone can pierce the tradecraft I practice as a matter of course.


I take many steps to keep my information secure. 


And that's fair.  I myself have plenty to hide, and I so far have done a very good job of doing so.  I like bitcoins because even tho someone can say "This address sent some coins to this other address", I have made sure that "This address" can't be correlated to "Me".

Fair point.  I don't believe that it's entirely analogous however, there seems to me to be a difference between accessing a protocol that hopefully can be accessed using a different exit node and blocking specific content.
 &gt; I disagree with him, but I think the proposal is reasoned.
I disagree with him and I agree, there is a certain reason involved, esp given the protocol blocking feature already present in Tor but the way it was presented combined with his bitcoin taint attempt make my spider sense go off in all kinds of ways.

What was their intent that you disagree on?  Having trouble discerning the intent behind "Shall not be infringed"? 


I do.   Why should one person have a monopoly on force?  When it's standard issue for our infantry solders, I guarantee a civilian will have one and should.  Graviton beam emitters, death rays, mini black hole grenades, whatever our technological prowess comes up with.


The founders intended the citizens to be as well armed as the armed forces.  Period.


I don't see it as being a valid argument against, I see it as being a valid argument for.  If someone has a portable nuke, I need one too, just to maintain the balance of power between the citizens and the state.  That's the whole point of the 2nd.  (just as an example, this can be argued for any Amendment)


So, you think the 2nd Amendment only applies to muskets?


I would be surprised.  I never once heard either Bush or Obama state that they intended to follow the Constitution.  In fact, I distinctly recall Bush referring to the Constitution as a piece of paper.  Obama reveled his true colors when he voted for Telcom immunity.  In addition, only one candidate actually had a track record of following the Constitution, something no one else has.

China and Russia want the same things all other superpowers want.  Dominance within their sphere of influence.  That means China expects to be able to dominate Asia, Russia expects to be able to dominate Europe without interference.  We expect the same behavior regarding South America.  Unfortunately, we've expanded our sphere of influence to the other superpower nations' doorstep.  That is why they are uniting against the United States now.  If the US were smart, they would buy up all the bitcoins they could as well as gold and get ahead of the curve, offer up bitcoins as the new world reserve currency but the US gains too much from the dollar to allow that to happen.

It's a good idea for Netflix but they would need to offer their service at a much lower price point for bitcoin customers, I have no idea what their prices are now but they would have to be near pennies for me to consider spending my btc on it (not that I would anyway as they really don't offer me anything I can't get for free).
Personally I think bitcoins are best reserved for when you need to either avoid state attention/taxes or in the pursuit of agorism.  Netflix can try to ride the bitcoin wave but if you have btc and elect to spend them on...that, well be my guest.  I won't, my bitcoin is reserved for more important things.

No.  
It says "    The Congress shall have Power […]

Great.  That means we, the People allow them to coin money for us, it says nothing about the *PEOPLE*s ability or right to coin our own currency.  There's nothing in the Constitution that restricts the rights of the people, only that of the govt.

The state has banned certain weapons and the state's agents in the courts have upheld this restrictions when the Amendment clearly says "shall not be infringed".  So, I personally don't agree with the courts.


Are they not people?


Well, there was a court case where it was determined that criminals who obtain an "assault rifle" have no burden to register it as it would be a violation of the 5th Amendment. 




Well, no offense but things like this let me know that our country has abadoned the rule of law a while ago.  Without amending the 2nd Amendment at that.


Not really.  What is clear is that the people in charge don't care about the Constitution and ignore it at their whim.

If that's the case, you shouldn't vote for any politician.  Not that I would argue with that.


Well, Ron Paul would probably have run Libertarian if our political setup wasn't so hostile to 3rd party candidates.  As it was, he picked Republican over Democrat.  I don't hold the Republicans as more villianous than the Democrats because just look at the state of our govt.  Both parties IMO are out to get us.


That's fair.  I disagree but that's ok.


Well, I think regarding Ron Paul as a kook of some sort is the majority opinion.  I think you are brainwashed because you choose to bypass the only candidate with a proven track record of following and respecting the Constitution.


It also is not a "living document" whose words and meanings change with time.




Actually it does.  Jill Stein was quite adamant in her views against the 2nd Amendment and for me, that's a non starter as far as her getting my vote.


I am well aware of that.  It would be nice if the rest of Congress and our President acted as if they were aware of that too, instead of just ignoring it or saying "we support the 2nd Amendment while we do everything we can to undermine it".

@_date: 2014-02-27 19:47:40


It's not bullshit, it's an example of the false choices that the people in power present to you, the voter.  I wrote Ron Paul in.
EDIT: My point was, if all 3 were presented, which would you pick?
In fact, to me, the biggest indicator of who was best for the country could be found in the one man who they tried extremely hard to marginalize.  Just look at how he was treated during the debates.  As I told a friend of mine who voted for Obama, "If Obama was really about and for "hope and change",  you would have never heard of him.


Nice to see how enslaved to the left/right Democrat/Republican paradigm you are.


Maybe.  We'll never know now.


No, I didn't.  A lot of people did tho.


What was it specifically you didn't like?  A man with a track record of obeying and following and *respecting* the Constitution sounds like a better choice for President than a man who was fast tracked from the Senate or a rich Mormon businessman to me.  
I personally think lots of people are dumb and/or mentally enslaved.  If you are not, you know it better than I.


Actually I don't think it takes any guts at all to go with the majority.


I had respect for Jill Stein, ever since she got arrested at the debates, but once I found out her position on the 2nd Amendment, she lost me.  I would rather have a president who respects all of the Constitution, not one who cherry picks the ones she'll support.

    Decentralized, no servers
    Bitmessage as a transportation medium
    One "Public channel" for offers, "Messages" for direct communication
    Bitcoin for payments
    Three multisig addresses: one for the payment, two for insurance payments
    Buyer and seller both send 5% of the sum to one multisig address
    Both have an (5%) incentive to be honest and stick to their side of the deal
    After the buyer receives the goods, all three payments are released: 5% back to the buyer, payment to the seller, 5% back to the seller
What excellent ideas.  Wow.  I hope the hope I feel when I hear this is warranted.  Will test as soon as possible.

I didn't say that.  However, I'm not arguing against the historical record.


You know, you should read the journal of Christopher Columbus.  




    "they are artless and generous with what they have, to such a degree as no one would believe but him who had seen it. Of anything they have, if it be asked for, they never say no, but do rather invite the person to accept it, and show as much lovingness as though they would give their hearts."


So yea.  I am sure that the Native Americans and the Austrailian aborinials and the Africans would have been much better off had they never encountered the White man.


Judging by your response, apparently it is.  You can't deny history.


Do you have a citation?  I mean, I'm not being racist but Whites have killed and raped far more black people than the reverse.




Only if you are wilfully ignorant of history, which you seem to be.

You have to understand that a lot of bitcoin owners, myself included, can be characterized as paranoid, and not including information such as my wallet is pinging an outside server is not and was not welcome news to me.

Less anonymity to be honest but I personally am not worried about that (I have my own ideas on how to preserve that), smaller target area (LEO can't just infiltrate a market), no sign up fee for vendors.  After the demise of several well known darknet markets, I'm hopeful that it'll be a more dispersed market hence harder to crack down on. We'll see how it goes, I suppose.

So I am now using ledger to track my bank account, my silver and my bitcoins.
I had to make a change to the script, I had to point the prices.db to ~/.pricedb for the --price-db to work.
So, after installing ledger, and installing a bunch of vim stuff, I made a test.ldg with the following information.
    2013/01/01 * Opening Balance
            Assets:BTC                            BTC 11000.9999999
             Assets:Precious Metals:AG.1N   XAG 3000.856   ; .90 silver in oz
            Assets:Precious Metals:AG.3N    XAG 1168.6864 ; .999 silver in oz
            Assets:Precious Metals:AG.4N    XAG 110          ; .9999 silver in oz
            Assets:Bank:Checking Account    $1,000,000,000,000,000.01
            Income                          $0
             Expenses                        $0
             Liabilities                     $0
     Equity:Opening Balances
I run ledger -f test.ldg bal
    $1,000,000,000,000,000.01
         BTC 11000.9999999
         XAG 1278.6864  Assets
     $-1,000,000,000,000,000.01
          BTC -11000.9999999
          XAG -1278.6864  Equity
I run ledger -f test.ldg -V bal XAG (After running the python script found at  and moving the file to ~/.pricedb
        $35,200.83  Assets:Precious Metals:AG.3N
        $3,313.20  Assets:Precious Metals:AG.4N
        $38,514.03  
So up to the date, spot market value of silver and bitcoins held. I'm trying to figure out a way to calculate 1N (90% or Constitutonal silver) coin value, I suspect I can just mulitply the XAG unit by .9 but I'm only now starting to figure this out. I spend all day today weighing my silver and was plesently surprised, hopefully others will find this useful as well.
Also I cross posted this to @_date: 2016-02-14 22:18:52


No.  You couldn't.


Fair enough.


Go ahead and register your domain and load up wordpress and take credit cards for your webstore and hope people will google it.  You are correct, you are failing to see.


I have no doubt it will be used for that.


Then don't use it.  I will be definitely be using it and I'm not worried about it.
@_date: 2012-12-20 07:40:39
Agree with your whole statement.
My point is that Tor is essential as without it, if/when you send coins you reveal your IP address to the blockchain.
But excellent write up.

Banks have interposed themselves in the way of all 3, and yes, that is part of what bitcoin is about.
As it stands, they are neccessary however.  Try cashing your paycheck without a bank account, you can but you'll pay a fine.  Try living your life without a debit card or credit card.  Cash only sure, to a point.  Money orders take a while to be mailed. Happiness?  Almost everyone I know would be happier if they could do without the stress imposed upon them by their bank but they have to use one to engage with the financial machine.

Examples please.  For instance, I've heard more about Bitcoin in a positive light from RT than I have from any other news source.  Should I distrust bitcoin out of some blind nationalism?  I have also heard more about Bradley Manning than I have from mainstream media.  Give me an example of where their newscasting was in error.  I am well aware of news agency bias, that is why I don't watch mainstream media, I don't care about Justin Beiber or the Royals latest heir to the throne, I care about international news.  I wont' get real news from the news agencies in the US, most of whom are owned by 3 companies, I get a cheering section for whatever the people in power are pushing today.


Where did I say that?  What could you have gotten out of 
"I've seen plenty of press coverage on subjects the mainstream US media ignores. I have never seen any claims to them being false."
that would lead you to believe I made such an equation?




As opposed to our system, where we have no real political choice?  Fair enough, here in America, young black males are disproportionately arrested or killed by the police? Fair trade?


There was a black guy who got a plunger shoved up his ass in New York.
They banned gay pride parades for 100 years in Moscow. 
 
Try taking a picture of a building or video taping the police.


None of that has anything to do with the quality of news coverage of real issues that RT covers.  None of it.


You are making a great deal of presumptions, which is perhaps not unexpected, with such a narrow world view.  Once again, name me where RT has shown a bias?  Because they show Americans the truth about our country that our media would prefer to keep hidden?  As for your reasonably fair and safe society that "I" grew up in, I see a society where black males are gunned down in the street for buying candy and wearing a hoodie.  I see a society that imprisons more blacks than were slaves during the so-called Slavery days.  I see a country that still hasn't made slavery illegal because it depends on it, in one form or another.  The society that is based on racial prejudice and genocide.  It's unfortunately sadly obvious that you lack any sort of clue.

Um, I took a look and the first one by region lists the Americas (Canada, Mexico, the United States and South/Central America combined) at 15.4 (144,595) deaths and Europe weighing in at 3.5 (24,025).
Now, going further down, the United States alone comes in at 4.8 (14,748), which is a bit lower than Europe.
So, I'm not really sure what point you were trying to make with that.  Go check the numbers, they are from your link.  Maybe you should have checked them first.
Now, Germany isn't quite the size of the United States if I recall and has nowhere near the population. 
Go dig up the relative size of Germany and compare any two states that fit in it's landmass and I'll compare any state or two that fits and we'll compare apples to apples.
 Also, considering that one of the first things that Hitler did was require the population to turn in their guns, I am further not sure what point it was you were trying to make.
“The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms.  History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty.   So let’s not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.”
- Adolf Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942
Nazi Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated.
Now, we can move this to or something if you want, but to keep it on topic, Bitcoins will see an ever increasing presence in the underground black market weapons trade, esp if regulations by the powers that be attempt to squeeze legitimate businessmen out of the legal market.

Can you?  Have you even read it?  What was the society that he first ran into like?


What's funny is that I have a few Russian friends and the reason they are portraying it that way is because that is actually how most Russians feel.  They feel that homosexuals are sexual deviants who are out to hurt children.  I don't agree with it, just as I don't agree with the similar attitude among Africans but that is the attitude towards gay rights in their society right now, just because you don't like their coverage on gay rights in Russia doesn't mean that their reporting on it is not accurate.  Gay rights currently has very little support in Russia, like it or not but be grateful for the accuracy in reporting at least. You still haven't given an example of why they are not a trustworthy news source, as I have stated, they are the only ones who have portrayed bitcoin both accurately and positively.  I have never heard bitcoin referred to as "bit-con" as I have several times on mainstream media.

So?  I'm not a bitcoin advocate.  I'm mention it to people who may be interested but I have no personal stake in if they use it or not.  It is too useful a thing to die off so they can recognize it as a benefit or not.  The smarter humans tend to understand it quickly.


HAHAHHAHAAHA.   If you think the internet is not owned or controlled, you haven't been paying attention or are not never educated. Didn't the US recently refuse to hand over control of the root DNS servers to the UN?  


That's not going to happen.  The voice of the community will be made up of a composite of the members.  There are plenty of An-caps and Minarchists and Agorists here who see the wonderfulness of bitcoin and how it can add those who follow that path.  That's a valid voice in this community that should be heard if it chooses to speak.  Maybe people will be persuaded, maybe not but we shouldn't censor any information in the misguided idea of knowing what information is better for a newcomer than that newcomer themselves.

Asking you to point out an example of untruthfulness after you've exerted that they were untruthful is not a strawman arguement.


Telling the truth is not praising.  It's telling the truth.  I don't think Zinn talking enough about the Civil Rights movement in the book, that doesn't mean what was said was untruthful.  As for regimes that murder people for disagreeing with them, ask Anwar al-Awlaki what he thinks of the United States in this regard.

All I was doing was answering the point about offering services in bitcoin.  
From what I understand, there is a control placed on dollars. 8 pesos to a dollar.  What's to stop a rental property, a web development group, a software company, tour guides, etc, from offering an option to pay in bitcoin (other than govt intervention)?  They can then sell thier bitcoins for dollars and convert them to pesos.  I assume there would be some way, given the will, to do so while remaining under the govt radar.  
I dunno, perhaps you are right, I'm not there and can't say.

We need to find a way to illustrate to the people that bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme, it's a currency that has arisen without the constraints of govt manipulation, and is immune from threats like this.  I for one, am still a bit happy that this is happening because I hope it will help awaken people to the vulnerability they are under from the banks and discover this as a means of escaping the bank trap.

As long as I keep it underground, you have no hope.  I can easily take any stolen bitcoins and get silver/gold for them without leaving any trace or record because it's in the best interests of both parties to remain anonymous.  
Mixing services don't really hinder tracking the bitcoins.  The point of bitcoins is to keep *YOURSELF* anonymous, the bitcoins will always be able to be traced mixing service or not.
I think I have found it quite easy to spend bitcoins without revealing my identity, no disrespect.


Indeed.  Find me.


Fair enough.  I'm willing to take that chance.  Esp considering that a new account can be made on demand.  I guarentee if I were to publish a bitcoin address and you sent bitcoin there, I could immediately turn it around for gold or silver and you will never be able to track it to me.

I'd rather not say, but there are ample opportunities to accept BTC for illicit or legal goods and services on the darknet.


You are the one making that decision, not me.  It is in fact, fairly easy in my view.


Sell honey, live below your means, have a steady income from a legitimate source and supplement your income, sell $1000 flowers on ebay, whatever, I'm sure there are many many ways to account for and launder any earnings that are made.  
I play the long game, I already have all the toys I want, any toys that I buy, I have the legitimate income to cover, any illicit earning I may or may not be making on the side, can be converted to cash fairly easily, loaded onto an anonymous debit card, or converted to silver/gold.  Or could simply be kept and invested and hidden for a future date.  Choice is up to you, but there are many many ways and I personally find it incredibly awesome to live in such an interesting time.  I plan on having some fun with it, not live in fear.  There are ways now, and they (the Adversary) have not the means to penetrate it if used properly by an intelligent person.

Unfortunately for you, you can not dictate to others what they can or can not do.  There are sites on the darknet where guns and ammo are readily being sold for bitcoin.  We should be aware of the benefits and dangers of all these new technologies but they are, in fact, attempting to take away the People's liberties.  There is no reason why I should not be able to order the firearm of my choice over the internet, and no, I shouldn't have to go in person to buy it.  Nobody needs anyone else to try to make things safer because it is a false goal that can never be reached.  What we should be doing is educating people to **all** of the choices out there, and let nature take it's course.

Take responsibility for owning your money.

Only a matter of time.
Honestly tho, in Instawallet's defense, 
a) they must have been a prime target, I applaud them for resisting attacks for as long as they did.
b) they provide an extremely valuable service, I have found them very useful for temporary storage of bitcoins.
c) this should serve as a reminder to everyone that your best best to take and keep your bitcoins under *YOUR* control.
d) I think they did the right thing by notifying the community.

You made a rediculous argument about including every possible subreddit and implied that that was my position.  That is a classic strawman argument.
A straw man or straw person, also known in the UK as an Aunt Sally,[1][2] is a type of argument and is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.[3] To "attack a straw man" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by replacing it with a superficially similar yet unequivalent proposition (the "straw man"), and to refute it, without ever having actually refuted the original position.[3][4] This technique has been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged, emotional issues.
As for your question asking, I answered it, didnt' I?  It's included because a large number of both communities recognize the merits of bitcoin.


Fair enough, no one can force you to speak.

I would see no reason why one bitcoin address should be different from another.  Might take a while. (due to SR's mixing) However, might not be wise to do so, if anyone ever corrolates your bitvisitor activity with a bitcoin address associated with SR, you could potentially be identified.  
So, I wouldn't do it personally.

I disagree with the assertions presented.
1) Even if every holder of bitcoin were swept up in a blind indictment, how are they going to know who/where the owners are?  I've used Tor with bitcoin from the beginning.
2) If this were to happen, all the activity would just move underground. Expect the bitcoin-otc market to explode.  The fact of the matter is that bitcoin as it currently stands is just entirely too useful.

"Knowingly" being the key word.

Remember that guy who went all in, maxed out his credit cards and did everything he could to put money into bitcoins?
I bet he's happy right now.
