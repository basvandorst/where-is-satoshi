Yes, hackers are actually able to intercept the P2P encryption once you send even 1 Satoshi to a controlled  wallet.  You are not alone, even many businesses who had their assets in crypto-wallets (mostly on blockchain) recently has had their wallet emptied the same way but no one talks about that since that would be awfully bad for the Blockchain reputation.  Blockchain is an emerging network in its own and is very secured though, but if you are not careful and if you do not apply enough measures to protect your wallet(s) ultimately your wealth on the network. The best way to protect your digital assets is of course knowledge, i think people must be taught at a more global approach on how to protect their digital assets/cryptos.

Hi.  A straight up answer to your question is YES. A Blockchain Wallet can definitely be hacked by crypto-hackers who are able to just empty your wallet once they sees an opportunity.  Another way hackers will hack a bitcoin wallet is through P2P interception.  This is not hard to do, what they would do is ask you to send them sats to another wallet as a proof that you actually own that wallet, once you have send them the sat/s they will do something called a 'draw-back-chain decrypting" well, once this is done your Bitcoins are gone. 
I would also advise any people mostly companies who have been victim of this kind of threat most recently.  Hackers are now even working with corporates to ease this process.  So my advice for everyone would be, NOT to send even 1 sats to a wallet which you are not sure to whom it might belong to.
I am very sad to see you lost your Bitcoins my friend, but the thing is you cannot get it back and that is how it is in the virtual world.  Please make sure your computer is safe and free of viruses too, that might help you to better secure your coins in the future.
