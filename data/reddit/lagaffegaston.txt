Maybe it is better to base the mining fee on the value being transferred 
instead of being based on a number of transactions.
I was trying to do some calculation to actually understand what is going on here, maybe I am wrong, let me know, but here we go.
    
       MINING DATA*
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A  Mining current Giga Hash                    18,576 GH/s
    B  Estimated Watt per GH                          650 W
    C  Total Watt used                         12,074,816 W
    D  Total Watt Per Day (C*24)              289,795,584 Wh
	
       TRANSACTION DATA
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    E  Number of transaction per day               20,000 trans/day
    F  transaction volume per day               4,200,000 USD (300,000 BTC)
                                          
       NETWORK COST
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    G  Estimated cost per Watt                       0.15 USD/kWh
    H  Total cost per day (D*G/1000)               43,469 USD
    I  Total cost per year (H*365)             15,866,308 USD
    
    J  Average value per transaction (F/E)            210 USD/transaction
    K  current transaction fee                          0.00700 USD/transaction (0.0005 BTC)                         
    
    L  Actual cost per transaction (H/E)                2.17350 USD/transaction  
    M  Transaction cost per USD sent (F/H)              0.01035 USD/USD
    N  Transaction cost per USD sent %  (M*100)         1.03500 %
       MINING FEE
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    O  Based on number of transactions (K*E)         140 USD
    P  Based on transferred value (M*F) 1.035%    43,469 USD          
      
According to this calculation the reason that the current transaction cost looks so high (2.17 USD/transaction) is because transaction fee is based on number of transaction instead of value transferred. As you can see if the fee was calculated based on the actually value that is being transferred, the fee would be much lower (around 1-2% to cover current mining cost).  
An easy conclusion to come to, is that basing mining fee on value transferred, instead of fee based on number of transaction, would be more economical viable model. However it might have other implication, if you happen to get a block with a high value transaction you get lot of fee, is this good or bad? Who would set the % fee, miners or should it be regulated, etc etc. But somehow it make sense for me that the network fee/security scales in relation to value transferred instead of number of transactions. I guess there is a lot of problem with this model that I have not thought about so I am not sure about this, it needs more calculation and scenarios to see the implication. Maybe using a hybrid model would be best
