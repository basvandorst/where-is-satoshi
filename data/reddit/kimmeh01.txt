Just make sure your coins are in a wallet you control (meaning you have the private keys).   Not on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:45:55
I should have added one more:
- That we have to put up with 16 more months of this bullshit to reactivate when there is a method in place NOW
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:44:33
Hence the "will" and not "have'.   It would be a safe bet that at least one will.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:26:40

Sometimes you gotta break a few eggs instead of kowtowing to the China cartel.   Lets rumble 
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:38:57
I'm trying to decide which part is the most disgusting.
- That a mining cartel exists which is capable of holding protocol upgrades hostage
- That the above mentioned mining cartel thinks they can force the direction of bitcoin
- That backroom deals dictate the future of bitcoin
- That core devs will sell out
I'm not opposed to bigger blocks.  I'm opposed to big blocks OR ELSE.   Why do these things need to be tied together?   Why not activate segwit, let it settle and move on to the next thing?
Fuck all that.

You have a little Jih on your chin.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:28:48
When one side doesn't negotiate in good faith -- this is what happens.   There is no technical disagreement on Segwit.    It's just hostage fodder for something else that does not have consensus.  Fuck 'em.

UASF/segwit NOW.  Let it settle.   Then do what's best for bitcoin, not Jihan or btCC or via or whoever.   If that is a 2/4/6/128MB block size, then so be it.  Don't unnecessarily tie these things together just as a ransom payment.

@_date: 2017-05-22 20:06:07
karma dictates the miners coins get reorged into nothingness.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:55:08
Some people have had enough of Bitcoin being held hostage by nation subsidies and cheating.   Further, the prospect of the BU devs being let loose in the wild is terrifying.   
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:53:13
Unless everybody gets sprinkles -- no fucking ice cream for anybody!!!!!
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:32:53
Why write the code when you can simply own the developers.  Duh.
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:32:21
Yes.  Quit being so mean.   Hop on aboard the SS Incompetence already.
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:51:05
This feels a bit like stepping over dollars to pick up pennies.
Volume makes money.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:15:06
Same.   Encouraging that luke-jr is outing some of the bullshit and lies around this 'proposal' in the other thread.

Public shaming isn't trash talk?

If only there was the ability to search....
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:22:30
Apparently you haven't met, or seen, or read a newspaper 
 about the millions of people who lost their life savings, houses, and everything they own because of banksters.
The argument against bitcoin is terribad.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:22:30
Some of us want a pony, but we don't take hostages.
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:39:49
The irony of having to submit all your personal information to trade something which is designed to avoid all this bullshit.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:17:37
BIP148 on core binaries.  Get that flag merged.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:52:20
My comment suggested the 'alternative' would be status quo.
We don't need Jihan or his tech.  Bitcoin is just fine.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:17:06
Iterative development is not computer science? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:38:20
Miners want a puppet dev team.   That is why we have this Rube Goldberg activation mechanism for the exact same thing.
@_date: 2017-07-01 12:29:36
Disingenuous code and some fake agreement that nobody knows exactly what they agreed to.   What could possibly go wrong.
Miners might run that shit code, but will wallets?  exchanges?   *shudder*
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:55:00
In due time.
@_date: 2017-05-29 03:16:40
Pre split coins are fine.   Just control your private key.  
Let the dust settle, and assess.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:33:38
Core  was not included at all.   
They did not agree to UASF.   They agreed to some future vaporware segwit(ish) implementation "down the road".
I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:54:07
Re-org them dirty coins bruh.   Sorry for your luck.   You want BU.  Go.  Now.  Do it.  Chicken.

I hope American Spite is up to the task.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:06:38
Being pedantic when the main point is bitcoin does not need Jihan, his miners, or his ASICs... at all.
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:05:36
As long as Bitcoin has it's own version of Lex Luther -- this shit will never end.
I don't give two fucks what Jihan wants, or thinks.

@_date: 2017-05-31 16:29:57
Devaluing bitcoin globally isn't even on the same planet as Segwit.   But I understand the rub.
Once bitcoin morphs into CorpCoin -- I'm sure we'll have to deal with that.   And lose.  Again.
@_date: 2017-07-07 20:47:30
Straight out of the Trump playbook.   
Take a big dump on everything and blame everyone else.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:44:45
While his personal stuff is batshit -- at least he's not a carpetbagger leveraging subsidized electricity to fuck everyone else for his benefit.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:53:37
The more core discussions I read -- the more I sympathize with the miners.
I'm unconvinced that anything major can be accomplished with the current structure.
I'm still down with    But if core isn't willing to fight against a hostile takeover, I'm wondering why we should.
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:34:18
You don't have coins.  You have an IOU.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:15:46
Core's flaw was the 95% threshold.   Your ability to measure SegWit's sufficiency prior to release is impressive.
So the miners block progress, then blame core for the lack of progress?  Sounds like a Republican.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:36:26
For reference, see the current US President.
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:27:53
Gotta break a few eggs and re-org some dirty coins to get shit done.   It's unfortunate, but it's time.
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:48:10
Probably not -- haven't seen the crash reports yet.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:33:59
In between crashes, you mean?

Not forever, not long term, not as a wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:59:36
I watched the whole scaling debate and it reconfirmed my commitment to UASF.
- Core Guy :  Cares about the tech, cares about the craft, cares about the opposition even.
- Purse Guy : Tech guy, doesn't seem to play the politics game much.
- BTCC Guy : Tries to outsmart core guy.  Fails.   Tries to get audience on his side.  Fails.  Big blocks or bust.
- BU Guy : Our BU code is ready to crash with big blocks TODAY
- BitPay Guy : The republican.  Fuck all of you, I'm here for the money.

@_date: 2017-05-31 14:05:10
Don't be obtuse.   It's not individual miners.  It's mining cartels that are shitting on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:03:41
Bitcoin would be just fine without Jihan, and without ASICs.  His only "contribution" is plunking down some coin, and cockblocking the protocol for his gain.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:44:06
Shocking that the government who has their hands out for every transaction wants a cut.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:57:23
Turd... launched.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:48:11
Fuck your personal if you want person.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:47:10
The miners made themselves the opposition when they cockblocked the capacity upgrade for years and years.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:01:23


AKA, completely out of touch with reality.    Let's entrust bitcoin's future to this dude.
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:53:48
Oh nonono.   UASF was the big fat hammer that made them flinch and come up with a convoluted way to 'save face'.

Grow a pair, FFS.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:23:32
At least 3 major wallets are already on board.
Let's see what happens when miners try to send their dirty coins around on Aug 1.   Shit will get real.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:17:03
Everybody was freaking out back in the S3 or older days worrying about a 51% attack from antPool.   They were half right.  It isn't a 51% attack, it's a walk in your fucking front door and outright take the keys attack.
 
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:58:36
Other snippets suggested they were, but the FUD is strong surrounding this whole deal.

You made my point.
@_date: 2017-07-07 20:51:18
Who the fuck would say that?  Where are his contributions to the protocol?
Why the hell is plunking down some coin earn you any respect?
Bitcoin would be doing just fine without Jihan, and without ASICs.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:59:50
What parts of bitcoin would be fine without ASICs do you not understand.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:57:22
You seem to think this pairing between the altcoin and bitcoin is permanent.
When you own an altcoin, you own the altcoin.   Has nothing to do with bitcoin.   That's just what you traded for it.
@_date: 2017-07-15 02:19:25
change bitcoin to gold.  Or stocks.   Now what?   Bitcoin has nothing to do with your question.
Nothing is guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:52:16
You have it backwards.
The BIP148 crowd are the techno, cyberpunk hippies.
The BCC crowd are the chinese doing what they do best.  Steal tech.

Pure stupidity.

Check yo crystal ball.  It needs service.
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:14:05

A failure to plan on your part does not make Bitcoin suck.   
Try sending a bar of gold to another country FFS.

Merge BIP148 into core.   Lets hear the other side.

@_date: 2017-05-23 19:43:48
It's like the Trump Election all over.   Switch Russians for Chinese.  Same low information voters.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:16:39
Holy fucksticks -- bitcoin will be an altcoin if we have to wait until 2018.

@_date: 2017-07-18 17:23:18
God damn -- that looks like a Trump Rally in print.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:05:29
Didn't you forget right?  right?   right?
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:48:45
Because you seem to think bitcoin's only purpose is a proxy for your local fiat currency.   Like gold.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:45:21
Even better computer science is implementing/measuring one major change at a time before doing anything rash.

NC is a crucible of something.    Not sure it's progress.
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:57:06
This is why we don't already have scaling or segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:15:57
Original Question.
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:27:48
Not on my phone.  Banking apps sure, but an app for every store?  Pfft, fuck all that.   I stand by my initial assertion.   Unless they can get it to just work, without having to download an app (for desktop/laptop/chromebook/etc) use -- it will fail.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:31:34
@_date: 2016-07-07 13:42:56
Unbiased reporting from Bitmain Tech/Wu Jihan.   LOL
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:52:00
The protocol.   Which miners are slaves to.  As designed.
@_date: 2016-07-07 14:41:24
Keep up the fight.   I'd like to see NC leave the domestic axis of evil in my lifetime.  :)
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:07:45
Once the 1%'rs get control of bitcoin, it will be a shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:12:17
The fact that we've been stuck in a multi-year long stalemate is evidence that somebody has a cockblocking share.
@_date: 2016-07-26 15:57:07
You -have- to download a desktop app to shop?  In 2016?  Never work.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:25:40
Then mine, don't whine.   The protocol is not within the purview of the mining cartel.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:36:09
Nor will I.  I will exit crypto before supporting this ChinaCoin.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:31:03
It's more when the coins were mined/sent -- not the wallet.
It's all about the private keys.  If you don't have them -- you don't own the bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:36:37
Why the fuck do you get a vote just because you can plug a miner in an outlet?
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:43:48
There is a pattern here.   Incompetence.   In signaling, development, making agreements, and communicating.
@_date: 2016-07-08 19:55:07
LOL, you almost said that with a straight face.
And, you spelled "laughing stock of the world" wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:52:47
If you have Jihan on your chin -- FUD up reddit.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:30:57
Fuck the trollbox, spend 5$ on your platform.
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:55:16
This has to be a joke right?   The blocks are not physically ANY larger.
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:50:16
The magic of chrome is that is also works with a million other sites.   If you had to download a single-purpose app to access ebay -- it would die.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:04:09
Like I've said before.  It's just numbers in a screen.  First mover advantage is running out.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:57:57
There's always the technologically superior litecoin.
Just numbers on a screen man.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:49:40
Its very expensive and uses a LOT of electricity, generates heat, etc.
It's not even close to free.    
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:56:33
Better open your gemini account now -- you just might be "verified" in time to catch the tail end.
@_date: 2016-07-27 13:17:09
People are willing to go to extraordinary measures to buy darknet crap.  I seriously doubt they would be willing to go through all those hoops to buy a comic book.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:44:52
What's segwit support at again?  Yeahhhhhhhhh
@_date: 2016-07-27 13:15:54
I like the tech, I wish you luck.   But even though I am a supporter of bitcoin -and- understand the technology -- I have no interest in downloading a shopping app for my desktop.   It's not a proper comparison to compare media streaming to vanilla shopping.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:09:47
If you have your private keys -- you can switch wallets without penalty. 
All coins held prior to Aug 1 will be fine no matter where they are (again as long as you have your private keys)
Let the dust settle before you do anything at all.  (IMO)
@_date: 2016-07-07 14:11:18
You used "crucible".   I'm suspect of any innovation coming out of NC besides bitcoin bible donations.  Sorry.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:30:08
Damage is done.   There are competing wallets that give two craps about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:29:23
I can't rule it out.  If they aren't willing to play defense -or- offense -- the next step is roll over.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:45:54
Anybody can mine.  But these days you need specialized hardware and unless you get free/very cheap electricity you may not ever recover your investment.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:38:18
It's our last hope to prevent bitcoin from becoming Jihancoin.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:42:44
"we" are not.   The Chinese cartel might -- it's on them.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:44:10
No, it's not a boycott.  It's defense against a corporate raid.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:09:23
The fact that the entire ecosystem is filled with shitty companies is unacceptable.
Coinbase is shit.
I suspect gemini is too, but it takes fucking months for somebody to glance at your id.
Poloniex is total shit.  Yet they are   LOL
We settle for shit service, from shit companies.
Crypto will never be mainstream until the on/off ramps are not a total shitshow and the exchanges function like grown-up exchanges.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:46:17
Your crystal ball be fubar.
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:18:29
Well then, lets checkout the code shall we.....
OH WAIT
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:45:45
If you left $1M on an exchange... This is financial darwinism at work.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:16:51
This is the Trump effect happening to bitcoin.   
* Don't have a fucking clue
* Don't care to learn about fucking clues
* Don't believe fucking clues contrary to your worldview, even when supported by fucking facts.
* Don't care.  Mine.  Mine.  Mine.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:30:26
It's like social.microsoft.com in chat form.   God fucking awful.
These outsourced crappy techs support is limited to 27 different flavors of 'is it plugged in?  is it turned on?'.
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:45:56
Hold strong.   Signing up for this crazy desperation move would be suicide.  
Hard Forking in 6 months?
HAHA HAHAHAHA
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:44:31
They are both worth exactly what somebody else will pay for it.
In one instance though -- it's 100% mine and not subject to scrutiny, confiscation, inquiry.    And I can sent it anywhere on the planet with zero bullshit.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:44:13
For a different reference.   This week I sent ~$700 of bitcoin.  It was a 'small' transaction, cost ~$1.25, and was confirmed within 15 minutes.
It's not really intuitive to the average user the concept of height/size -vs- amount.
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:16:19
I don't keep my bitcoin on 'sites'.   There is a ton of info on here and elsewhere on how to keep your bitcoin safe.
If you don't have your private keys, or even know what they are -- your bitcoin isn't yours.   Research a bit ;)
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:02:53
They can do whatever the hell they want with their altcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:58:33
My views are that Trump voters should have to wear a scarlet letter for 3 whole generations.
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:52:42
Implementing Segwit is more important than HF2MB.   No need to conflate the two.  They are seperate issues.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:28:10
All this donkey fucking when the simple answer is right fucking in front of you.
Just fucking activate segwit you bittards.  BIP148
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:01:45
^supposed to be.   There is a big turd in the pool though.  Sepsis is coming.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:57:42
Change Core to miners and it's perfect.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:36:40
Think of the poor, poor miners.  *sniffle*
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:26:28
You have a little Jih on your chin there bruh.
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:53:39
Oh please.  This is nothing.  No target.  No scope.  No timeline.  No consensus.  No agreement.  No commitment.
This is dog &amp; pony sprinkles for the easily distracted.

Sort of.  The purchase price goes to the chinese cartel.
But if you mine on  pool -- it'll equal out.

If you don't control the private keys -- you don't own the coins.

Every single additional hashing that is added is more risk for the cartel.  UASF

Miners are the ones who 'mine' new coins, and in the process validate pending transactions.   They get rewards (in bitcoin) for doing so.
Every transaction is priced based on size, not amount.   So if your $5 came from 30 different micro-transactions -- it's large and costs more.   Every transaction with every coin is on the 'blockchain' or public ledger.

If you have enough bitcoin left, consider consolidating it.   Send all of it to a newly created wallet for a very low fee (assuming you don't need it soon, it could take days to confirm).
Then, when it gets to the other wallet address -- it will be 'small'.   You are taking all the little inputs for the coins, and combining them into one input on the other side.

Get 'er done core.   Or hand over the keys.

More like .16 btc/mo for 13THs.
Your break-even (assuming 2300 for miner+psu) is over 220 days.
That assumes.
-  Nothing breaks
-  Zero pool fees (good luck)
-  No difficulty increases  (wont happen)
-  Bitcoin prices don't go down
-  Pool has good luck
If it was a slam dunk -- we'd all be mining ;)
