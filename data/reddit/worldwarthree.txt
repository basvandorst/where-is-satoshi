Ya how about we all work to vote this "They" person they're talking about out. Sounds like a scarey guy.

You may want to look into that again because I've been buying on there with a CC lately.

Try adding Bank Account and use your CC.

I don't think your correct about that. I just started buying BC like 4 weeks ago and added my CC no problems.

You must be rich to travel to Africa with all that water and food! /s Just like the poster above said its only to make yourself feel good and you just proved it by saying "I give money to poor people in Africa for water and food." You don't, you sit at your computer and give a donation to an organization. You have no idea what your money is being spent on.  Don't kid yourself.

Which one did you end up buying? Do you recommend it? Would you of bought a different one now after owning that one?

I've sent probably over 800 e-transfers in my time. I know exactly how it works. Save your sorrys for yourself, because you'll need them next time you fuck up.

This article has to be missing some key information. When you do an e-transfer you set a security question and answer. The receiver must know the answer to the question to withdraw the money..
Oh I found it, they just hide it in the article." Charlotte Mustard of Peterborough, Ont., says she didn't  know sending e-transfer passwords via email can be risky. She’s out  $3,000 after a fraudster intercepted payment for her new furnace "
So they're email address's were compromised and they sent the password to the receiver and it was intercepted that way.  This has absolutely nothing to do with the Banks. This is peoples own negligence.

Yeah, pretty stupid of him. How is that the Banks fault? The bank could answered that security question!

It's just like your password for btc wallets. If someone gets that then your wallet will be compromised. Are you going to blame the company you have your wallet with if someone gets your password? No your not. Reddit is such a shit hole, your all so fucking stupid.

You mad because not one person agreed with you or something..? You can't even put up an argument. Little childish jabs is all you got..
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:29:23
You have not provided a single fact. You're just a little angry moron.
@_date: 2019-09-25 12:26:51
No it doesn't.
