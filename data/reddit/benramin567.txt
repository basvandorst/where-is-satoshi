Doesn't work to europe.
@_date: 2018-09-07 15:15:16
Why? No one is forced to work there, he can make up any rules he wants to.
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:46:45
How come society always excludes the person in question?
@_date: 2018-09-07 15:16:47
Because cigars have no filters, cigarettes do.
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:24:28
It's a Norm MacDonald joke.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:41:51
I am trying to cash out euros.
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:16:55
Or, you know, you just don't have to work there. Why should "we" be allowed go force him to follow our rules which he had no part in making, over his own property?
@_date: 2018-09-07 15:34:24
Of course he shouldn't make rules violating human rights, but unionization is not a right.
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:32:01
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:56:29
I can't transfer to my bank, it won't let me.
@_date: 2018-09-07 15:19:40
Not following the law doesn't necessarily make someone a piece of shit. Tell me, why SHOULDN'T he be allowed to make whatever rules he wants to on his own property?
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:03:08
Why work there of you won't accept the terms of service? No one forces you to work there.
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:23:29
but also really
@_date: 2018-08-15 09:40:20
Both can be right.
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:30:08
Except that BCH follows the whitepapers while Btc does not.
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:06:46
But people do. There's a reason people buy iPhones on the first day instead of waiting 3 years when they're cheaper.
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:10:10
So? When it comes to satoshis vision it's a lot closerm
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:04:40
Yes, getting more for your money is bad!!1!
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:55:02
By promoting the real Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-20 09:47:01
Lmfao do people still think greed caused it? Ot was the Federal Reserve that was guilty, not business owners.
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:00:25
Do you think all countries got greedy at the same time or what? 
The US economy had effect on countries they traded with.
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:07:30
They still had central banks. Also, small depressions are unavoidable, it usually happens after big technologic breakthroughs.
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:55:27
That was proven...
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:41:18
This never happened.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:27:27
Wtf, how much bitcoin do you have?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:12:56
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:39:22
What happens when we coinbase gives both regular and 2x bitcoins? Do we get double the money? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:51:32
I see, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:14:46
Coinbase takes €1.
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:50:28
It is also well known the proof was planted by the same of shit that stole his Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:33:22
No, but he seems to actually give legit advice, and he also seems to be well respected at what he does. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:00:52
When will the split happen?
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:10:11
It's too bad, but yeah. He is an old stubborn man.
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:46:11
I really doubt that.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:13:53
Can't he just sell that for free cash?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:07:04
Tai Lopez teaches is business schools all over the US. He also gives full refunds, so hardly a scam.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:18:41
I have to my debit as well.
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:40:51
This never happened.
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:51:07
What party did they promote?
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:53:37
They should never, ever do that. Especially not when the charges were dropped.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:58:38
Except that they dropped the murder charges.
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:46:45
Hahaha, the eternal boogieman. The alt-right is irrelevant and Dave Rubin has nothing to do with them.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:17:54
No, it absolutely is justified to blame the victim for not learning to read properly.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:48:51
I don't understand what you mean.
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:53:37
Gold was a currency in the US until Nixon.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:19:22
You do realize he gives full discounts on everything he offers?
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:41:33
And they still work there, don't they?
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:03:20
Is Ethereum really worth buying?
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:08:01
It's hardly scams if you can get all your money back.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:06:19
How did it go for him?
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:12:58
That's not even close to true. In Stockholm you can't even leave your tools when you're taking a break because people will steal them.
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:36:29
Sounds like I need to buy some of that. I don't wanna repeat what I did with bitcoins by waiting too long.
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:58:47
Is that so? How come?
@_date: 2019-09-27 17:24:10
That's not what interest rates are. Fees are different.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:17:52
If you are so stupid that you don't check before hand, you kind of deserve what's coming.
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:16:44
You can't just stop calling it theft because they steal less, it is not a spectrum.
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:18:29
Who has he murdered?
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:54:09
Bitcoin Messiah
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:01:42
I googled it and there were no proof that he had any involvation.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:53:49
Get over it.
@_date: 2019-05-21 07:29:18
Not even close to true. It happened because the feds extreme credit expansion.
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:16:12
@_date: 2018-12-11 08:28:19
That's what the picture says...
@_date: 2019-05-21 07:30:28
The north had slaves too.
