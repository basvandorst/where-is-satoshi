yes, I understand that and plan on going to the bank, I am looking for advice on if I should tell them it was for btc, because some people have had issues with their banks regarding btc transactions

Well this has been a learning experience. I definitely will be doing a more secure way of selling in the future, interac etransfers are just so damn appealing because theyre so fast and easy but I see the risk in them now.

So they unfroze my account except for the 150.00 but looks like I might get banned from e-transfers. SO FRUSTRATING. I do about 4 etransfers a month, and this is the only one to EVER have had any issues, and now theyre going to ban me from it potentially? Such a piss off.

thats what I was thinking, I know this has less to do with bitcoin than the fake that this buyer may have been flagged

cool thanks!

This is exactly what I'm afraid of. This is so annoying especially because I have student loans depositing to my account, and rent supposed to be coming out. This is the worst time for this to happen. I'm really hoping I don't encounter as many issues as you, that just sounds like such a hassle.

I ended up losing the 150.00
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:27:57
Interesting, I might have to look into that. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 22:52:24
In this case, what would happen to my bank account, would I lose that 150.00? 
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:06:47
Cool. Appreciate the advice, thank you. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 03:34:31
excellent, appreciate the insight thanks a lot!

Thats what I'm thinking, but I'm not sure what I should tell my bank if they ask what the transfer was for in the case that they ask. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 03:39:34
It's less about the 150.00 and more about having a useful feature (e-transfers) being disabled as a result of this. I do agree this the exact reason why decentralized currencies are important, so that your money is in your control completely, 100%.

Honestly just looking to see if anyone else sort of encountered a similar problem, not too familiar where else to ask.
