Yes. I know. But they fundamentally changed banking as we know it.

They said the same thing about credit cards and the internet.

The same could be said about bitcoin!

There's 0 according to me. I represent the bank of america. I promise.

I am against bitcoin, but all for other people using it. I don't have the finances to run the risk of crashing, and I trust it less than my cat with something shiny on my kitchen counter.

I got one on my first try..   
edit: that's not what you're trying to do, is it...

Spending and spending are apples and oranges now? Even at 100 percent bitcoin is still less then .001

Yup. Trolling the discussion when it's not news of bitcoin on the cover of some magazine. Classic @_date: 2015-09-29 10:25:13
The underwriter can ask for just about anything them damn well please. This includes clear sources of continuous and obviously legal money streams from contracts or a job or interest on an annuity. The underwriter can't prove that your bitcoin cash is a money stream and not just a one time chunk and that's why they don't want it

Bitcoin is solving a problem that doesn't really exist. It's a better system, but the marginal analysis is what kills it. It's never going to be worth the risk for middle adopters to buy into the currency when the price might crash tomorrow while everybody else is still buying things with fiat dollars. As long as there's basically no cost to using cash and there's a huge risk that tomorrow your life savings might completely go away if you transfer over to bitcoin, it's going to be what it is today. Cool, kind of useful, "the way of the future", and totally doomed

Here's a cool argument. In 2010 Visa, Mastercard and Amex reported 3,273+2,047+702 trillion dollars in payment volume on their networks. That's 6 quadrillion dollars in a year. Bitcoin has been averaging about 60 million per day, so 60*365=21,000,000,000,000 or 21 trillion. When the silk road was killed various annalists found that only 4-6% of bitcoin transactions were actual purchases of real items (IE not theft, speculation, investment). This means about 1.314 trillion in transactions for real goods. This represents an approximate .000219% market share with respect to major credit cards only. I wish there were better numbers available, but I can't find them. My argument is that .000219% is not very much at all

This is an interesting point of view, but I have to point out something that you're missing. People are downvoting me because I landed on the other side of the debate. If I said whatever they agree with I'd be in upvote city USA. The problem here is the user base and they  way the wield the downvote/upvote button. I'm not going to downvote you for disagreeing with me. You're gonna downvote me, though.

In 2013 when the silk road was killed various market annalists found that only about 4-6% of BTC volume was transactions for real goods as opposed to speculation, investment, theft etc. That puts the worldwide daily transaction volume in the region of 4 million USD/day. Visa reported $3,273,000,000,000,000,000 of spending on visa cards in 2010. That puts bitcoin at 3.32088e-8 percent market share with respect to visa credit card spending ONLY. This doesn't even include mastercard. It doesn't include cash. This is visa network spending only and the numbers I found here were all the way back in 2010. They've definitely gone up. What's bitcoin's current %spend on real goods?
  
**0.0000000332088% of the daily transactions that occur for real goods are bitcoin.**

This place is a bitcoin support group for people who have way too much fucking risk in their portfolios and it's all piled into bitcoin

The bitcoin hivemind is going to downvote the shit out of me for posting my opinions here, like they always do, but here's the problem:  
Nobody **needs** bitcoin. Nowhere in the world does anybody use bitcoin for anything that they **need**. This means that bitcoin is doomed to be a commodity, like show diamonds. Bitcoin doesn't do anything. You can buy shit with it, sure, but you can buy shit with diamond rings, too. I'm willing to bet you could buy shit with diamond rings easier than you could with BTC if you just walked into a store and asked to pay with one or the other.

This is exactly the kind of shit I'm talking about. You're just telling me outright that I'm wrong and that I have no idea what I'm talking about without even voicing your own opinion. This the the reason this sub blows wads. It's a giant bitcoin circlejerk. Bad news gets downvoted into oblivion and sensational shit that lifts the spirits of people with hundreds or thousands of dollars sunk into digital currency gets upvoted. There is NO discussion here. None. Fucking none at all.  
  
**TLDR Bitcoin doesn't do anything. It never has and never will. It's only "worth" money because of people speculating the market. Once people realize that nobody needs bitcoin for anything ever the market will crash and everybody in the market is going to be a sad fucking panda. This has already happened a dozen times.**

Oh yeah?
