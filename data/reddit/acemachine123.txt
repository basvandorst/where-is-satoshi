Might be a little late to the game but to all early adopters of cryptocurrencies - - How did you come to know about this game changing technology? Was there a forum back in 2010, 2011 discussing about BTC like today? Is reddit the place for it? How do you get in early in the game? I seem to be missing the boat all the time

Whenever you cash out, do you normally convert to tether and buy back on the dips? What is the best strategy?

Transferred some BTC from gdax to kucoin and it was almost instant. Any reason for this? Segwit?
