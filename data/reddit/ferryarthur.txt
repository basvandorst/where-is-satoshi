Uhm Gdax? That was the main reason i used CB. Now i cant even close my account..
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:43:20
Yeah.. The busier btc is, the higher the price. a few months ago it was like 1$. Eth and ltc are cheaper in that regard. But using Gdax as other suggested is the best way.

CB&gt; gdax&gt; bin. No fees

''it needs a healthy correction''
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:17:21
Dont you mean bitcoin gold? That was now. But there is another and bigger fork this month. That wil be a war and an attack on the og btc.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:00:04
That is simply not true for btg. So i'm not sure what you are trying to say here? Besides that, coinbase isnt the place for alot of coins. The only reason segwitz b2x was an option was because it was a direct fight against bitcoin. They couldnt co exist.  Storing your btc on coinbase during something like a segwitz isnt a smart choice to begin with. Storing it there at all isnt smart at any time, except for small amounts.

How did you know i could even read that? xD Anyway, in the netherlands you dont pay taxes. It counts as money here, so you only have to pay wealth tax if you re rich.

Mine are always instant?

Where is the 10% for the community!?
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:20:25
Though that isnt saying much if the creators dont give out the info. Btg didnt give anyone anything to work. Didnt release the info everyone needed. Its like saying you had a year to work on a job, but only getting the details the day before it ends.

Ohh damn xD... I dutched up my English xD... I usually dont do that though.. I screwed up..  But it isnt that hard to understand once you try. I learned it all in a few days back in early october.. Too bad i'm poor so my earnings arent that great in actual numbers. :P Percentage wise? Those gains are awesome. Too bad we didnt get into crypto earlier.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:12:36
Same goes for me, i can just switch between the 2 within seconds.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:44:54
Yeah that is partially true, but everything needs a pullback. So buying a bit lower when its rising is always possible. Though you dont need to wait for the lowest and miss out. ater that you could leave it hanging and miss the stress of selling it and rebuying.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:14:51
Damn that hurts...
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:15:58
Haha yeah i know, but i read your replies in the wrong order haha
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:34:47
Mehh, buy 2 for the price of one net more gains. You could always sell part at the top and buy low again for triple gains. Doubled my btc without putting in extra money.  But to each his own
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:05:55
I bought in at 6k, i earned grandad's respect! He keeps messaging me everytime it hit new highs. Though he only has a small amount to try it out. Still beter dan interest from your bank.
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:54:50
Because BTG is a segwit too and coinbase with only 3 coins available doesnt care about softforks. B2x is an exception since it would have replaced bitcoin entirely if it won.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:24:53
you miss out on a lot of btc that way though.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:19:10
No that was pms.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:59:09
Same. Ill see it rise or die at the bottom
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:21:46
What about the segwitx2 and bitcoin gold? I keep reading different things about both. Gold being able to survive just like cash(relay protection) while the other is a direct attack and only bitcoin or it can survive.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:16:20
Finger in the air. But CB is knows to react slowly. Weeks or months arent unheard of. My current one is 3 weeks and going. And if you want sources: just google coinbase and stuff like support/slow/sucks etc.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:24:25
Sooo mannyyy things.... xD So cash, gold and 2x? Especially x2 and gold seems confusing because of overlaps. Gold is akin to cash while 2x is a kill or die situatie vs the original?
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:12:13


Yeah im planning to wait it out anyway. Not planning on trading.  Maybe some alts through eth because of the lower fees. But i have a small amount of the alts i want. Paper seems a bit scary :P. Do you think breadwallet is better than electrum, exodus or any other desktop wallet? Mobile breadwallet is safer? And thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:07:03
The fastest way as in: being easy to lose them? xD
 And learning from that experience. 
Because of the whole segwitz im not sure what to do. Dont have a ledger etc. I dont have alot of money invested. I dont want exchanges or wallets taking my bitcoins or the ones from BTG/sigwitz.
You're dutch right?:P Judging your username haha.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:29:10
And the best way to survive it is to store your coins somewhere where you hold the keys or where they announced taking care of the split? Not losing out on any side of the coins because of reasons.
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:51:44
Do you think electrum on desktop would be a good choice?
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:08:26
You can also go voinbase and use gdax to trade. (its the same owner, so if you log on you can auto login to gdax.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:48:41
Yeah xD. My Dutch banks transfers my money to coinbase in like 3 hours..  Except for during the weekends, though i dont know which of the 2 is the cause. I find it better to just send it myself, instead of using CB/GDAX to ask for it.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:34:35
Ja het is alleen meer dat een ledger gelijk merendeel van mijn funds is xD.. Ben maar een student met wat schulden die hoopt dat wat slim investeren hem na zijn studie helpt. Had eerder op de boot moeten springen haha. Paper leek mij ook niks.. Een normale usb is ook wat eng.. Windows blijft windows xD. Ben gewoon bang dat ik iets verkloot haha.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:46:01
Except for that fact that coinbase emails get read after 2months. So it would be after the fork. Its basically to late now to waver for them. They'll sit out the ride. Move your bitcoins out and leave them alone for awhile.
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:48:52
Yeah i like both, vi is my number 1 classic FF for sure. IX is my favourite ps1 era. VI was also just so unique, so many weird and unique stuff. It felt like everyone was the main character. IX actually took alot from VI, with characters havingg their own arcs seperate from each other at the same time. Kefka(actually win) and Kuja are also the only guys to destroy a planet. :P Although VIII was pretty screwed up too.
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:19:25
Yeah but i think IX did it pretty well, the FMV's still look good unlike VII. The characters models just need some smoothing since the backgrounds were amazingly drawn. But yeah the models off vii are just horrid, even 1-6 aged better. Its usually games that tried to realistic that aged bad. If a game had a unique style they usually aged better.
