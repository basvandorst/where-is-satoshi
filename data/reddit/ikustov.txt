Can you edit with less exclamation marks? Post is nice but screaming not ok
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:47:06
In a bank. One of the biggest in my country
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:00:28
Where do you buy those coins?
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:56:25
So basically the same spread.
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:42:26
I’m in for bitcoin. Trying other options too, though
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:36:24
It’s from the bank. What’s the spread in your country?
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:14:56
If it comes out as something brown and liquid, I’d hope it’s a Chocolate, not shit.
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:37:40
I’d consider this in case of apocalypse
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:58:47
Seems like you never bought gold bars. Or your country has different spread policy for gold
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:25:17
Looks pretty much like this 
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:09:45
I’m pretty confident holding it for now. But thanks anyway. ��

What service you’re using for this data?
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:12:09
At this subreddit 99% waiting for collapse scenario for banking. Aren’t we?
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:04:12
But how do you verify if junk is gold not other metal?
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:46:33
What spread do you have in your country?
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:26:42
No crying. I did my research. Only sharing.
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:36:35
That’s the plan :)
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:54:12
Thanks for points. I asked about spread beforehand so I knew what I was doing. And it’s ok, I bought It for the long run.
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:55:09
Yeah... so you just thought “I’ll just copy and paste some random phrase from internet about bitcoin and let those guys figure out”. Nice. Real nice.
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:03:15
Next time buying, I’m coming to Czechia
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:59:51
Yeah... but it would still be betting on the old banking system. Isn’t it?

Here you go, mate. [  
Use this service to calculate what can you count on based on your PC Hardware. If you have 1 GPU with 1080Ti you can get around $0.44/day in revenue. Profits gonna be negative  
Easiest way to start is by using [   
\*no referrals, because I don't care. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-12-29 08:05:04
I don’t know what that means
@_date: 2019-12-29 07:11:14
Thank you, kind stranger, for satoshi
@_date: 2019-04-16 16:31:42
Local bitcoins works just fine
