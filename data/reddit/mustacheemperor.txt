Great point, this is what I would be most concerned as an attack vector from this app. The packet would still be sniffable, but chances are you wouldn't see it when it was sent. OP can only get absolute trust from users by open sourcing the code, checking the network traffic will have to do for anyone who wants to audit this themselves.

Well, only if you lack the basic level of technical competence necessary to packet sniff your home network, in which case you're probably not too informed on crypto tech either. If the app claims to be fully serverless it will be obvious if it is not. 
Edit: [Use this app]( or any of the other [similar options]( For a community that crows about normies who can't understand crypto tech, the concept of reading your own network traffic certainly seems exotic here. 
Edit: Regardless, I still suggest not entering your wallet credentials into this application unless it is open sourced by and/or otherwise audited by the community, or until has it audited for security by a trusted third party. See the smart folks below explaining why you're still at risk.

Just like bitcoin! So if you can do all the work to understand bitcoin enough to spend your money on it, you can probably follow basic directions for using software. 
Edit: Since this is an app, you don't even need to google how to use wireshark. If you can google "packet sniff android" there is an [app that does it for you.](

True, someone else made the point that there ARE threat models this app could potentially exploit that would be hard to spot with a packet sniffer. I would not advise entering wallet credentials into this app, and I would advise OP open source it if he wants people to pay for it.

If this isn't connecting to an external server at all and only makes requests to public APIs I'm not sure how a malware miner or crypto stealer could possibly work. That's not my crypto tech expertise though, that's my using a computer expertise. If you know a way to run a crypto stealer or malware miner on a box without an outside internet connection though, definitely don't open source that shit, since you'll be unfathomably rich! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:51:28
I can't really answer that for you, I don't know more about crypto stealers than what is necessary to know they need an internet connection to work. 
But I'd expect you're right, I don't see a way one could work without knowing your wallet either.

I expect OP would not be advising people to sniff the network traffic if there were packets being sent by this application that look like that profile. If these are all requests being made to public APIs then a bunch of encrypted requests to an "opaque CDN domain" will certainly stand out.

Sure, but it seems OP would rather not put this commercialized work up on the public domain. I too would encourage OP to open source this on a license that lets him retain commercial use, but it's ultimately their decision.
do consider releasing this as open source [under a license]( that will keep other people from just ripping your work off and reselling it. I think you'll get more paying customers from the trust effect than you will lose from people taking your work.

Please, list one way to move a packet from my phone to my router without it being detected by a promiscuous packet sniffer on my home network or a sniffer attached to the device's networking interface. I'm looking forward to learning a new thing, apparently there's a million ways to do this even though [I can]( find [zero]( ways to prevent a packet entering the local network from an interface being detected by a sniffer.

I don't think I'm the one acting superior here. My point was that if you have the technical aptitude to understand bitcoin enough to buy it, you can figure out how to download and use an app.
What is it with you?

True! Hopefully someone trusted by the community can audit it that way. I hadn't considered android apps were likely easy to at least partially reverse engineer - .NET is, so I'm not surprised the java code is transparent enough to audit. Given how many people here were taken aback by packet sniffing I don't think it's fair to expect of the wider community though, haha. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:49:16
Tell me why, please - I'm excited to learn something new about something I think I understand! What exactly is wrong about what I am saying? I want to make sure you're right too.
