an overlay in a different color, say, green, for BTC stored in multisig addresses would also be interesting.

why not suggest the use of a VPN provider to circumvent the the geo-blocking?

buy a pebble watch and get bitcoin notifications from an android phone - that's what I do...

what bitcoin credit union are you talking about?

It's great that more merchant are accepting bitcoin and companies like Bitpay make it easy, but the real question is when will OP start retaining some of those bitcoins to use elsewhere instead of simply liquidating them and receiving dollars.

But what does your bank charge you to send money via SEPA?  Yes, Bitfinex has a minimum of $20 fee for inbound wire, but you also need to consider the cost of sending a USD SWIFT wire in the first place.
Bottom line: having to resort to traditional bank transfers (FED, SWIFT, or SEPA) to get money into a bitcoin exchange pretty much kills the economics on small amounts.

This is also true of Mastercoin.  OP is definitely misrepresenting the facts surrounding the "meta-coins" of Mastercoin and Counterparty.  Those metacoins, in fact, enable a lot of extra functionality that Colored Coins simply can't match.
While I appreciate that in its relative simplicity, Colored Colns satisfies certain limited smart property use cases, outright misrepresentations about the competition taints an otherwise excellent letter.

What about plugging into Bitfinex?  They have all the liquidity of Bitstamp and frequently have better prices (at cheaper commissions) on their own book.  Plus, when you wire money to them, it credits at around 3:30 AM EST to following day.

Not a US bank either - operating from this institution will NOT absolve you of your federal or state MSB/MT registration requirements.  Cryptocapital, however, is a good option for US bitcoin businesses who are shut out of the domestic banking sector and need to bank somewhere.

tl;dr FinCEN is suggesting that banks ought not to be so heavy-handed with denying banking services to MSB's outright.  Not all MSB's created equal, Banks are *not* MSB regulators, etc.
Good for bitcoin businesses? I think so...

I was thinking something like 0.01% (1 basis point) - not enough to really make any money on commissions, but just enough to discourage wash sales.  
Imagine if there was micro postage for e-mail, even just $0.001 per e-mail would eliminate spam overnight...

There is no evidence that Mt. Gox "lost" anyone's money.  The waiting sucks, but none of us really have any facts regarding any "losses" arising from this problem.

This guy is conflating two uses of the term "legal".  The is the concept of "legal tender",i.e. the requirement to accept a currency in the settling of all debts public and private, which, as I read it, Sen. Coburn is basically confirming that bitcoin is not legal tender, is being confusing with the notion of legality in the colloquial sense, i.e. what is permissible under the law.  
In short - not legal tender does **not** mean illegal.  He is uninformed obviously ignorant of the concept of "legal tender" - he won't get far on Capitol Hill - Just ignore this...

Kraken signed an exclusive deal with Fidor.  They will not bank another bitcoin exchange.

Exactly - cold storage is not insured.  I am not impressed at all.

I doubt he will - OP is a shill for colored coins.  Intellectual honesty and facts are incompatible with the underlying intent of the letter: bashing colored coin competitors.

Use Bitfinex - no volume at Kraken...

First off, Sparkasse is an Austrian bank, not a German bank, although they may have a subsidiary there - dunno.  Moreover, Sparkasse Bank Malta PLC, is the Malta subsidiary that is known to be bitcoin friendly - can we get a little more clarity here?

Bitfinex has been using multisig for cold wallets for last few months

"Customer funds stored in Coinbase USD Wallets are held with an FDIC-insured financial institution."
is *not* the same as "Customer funds are FDIC insured" - have no illusions - seems very doubtful that Coinbase USD wallet are individually insured for $250k each.

Good idea and could be implemented at any number of exchanges, but good luck offering it to US persons - The CFTC won't allow this without the proper licensing, which, if granted, would certainly be after any fork happening in the next 6 months...
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:10:07
Sidechains are open source - why not implement it on litecoin - seems  to me that the litecoin community might be in a position to move faster on the hard fork requirements and make true, 2 way pegged sidechains a reality...

Unless, of course, he destroyed the keys to those early blocks as many have suggested in the past.

Then it would be money transmission and 21 would be subject to all the headaches and hassles associated with what is essentially becoming an exchanger of bitcoin for fiat.  I am sure that they want to steer clear of that business model for obvious reasons.

Why isn't something like this happening in UK/Isle of Mann where a similar coordinated shutdown occurred last year?
