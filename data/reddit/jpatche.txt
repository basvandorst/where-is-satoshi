Just looking for a Bitcoin shirt that I like. Hard to give specific reasons why things aren't stylish.  It would be nice to wear a shirt in public that would start some conversations about Bitcoin, but every option I've found is pretty repugnant.

Almost certain - 85%
Reasonable chance - 15% (too high of a percentage to be putting all your eggs in one basket)

Hah. That one is good. Didn't see it online anywhere?
