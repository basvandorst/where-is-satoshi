How could it be a 317 year old fiat currency if they got off the gold standard in 1931?

If crime goes down then private prisons don't make enough money and have to find a new source of income. So they cut costs by mistreating prisoners and the staff or by paying off judges to find more people guilty like the whole "kids for cash" scandal.

Because the private sector isn't providing the service just to provide the service. They're providing the service to make a profit. If they can't make a profit they can't run their business.
Also I skimmed the paper but it does gloss over a lot of issues. Like they mention for-profit judges in Greece. They then say (emphasis mine):


First "competitively"? What was keeping the judges from co-operating with each other to raise profits? Companies do that a lot. There was that recent Silicon Valley scandal where companies decided to secretly agree not to hire each others' employees to keep salaries down and prevent employees from shopping around for better benefits. Second of all, what was this "reputational check"? If you expand this onto a larger scale, how would a reputational check work when judges and the police are both for-profit and working with each other?


You're drawing the wrong conclusion. Profit isn't bad. But providing basic services should not be a for-profit venture. Imagine if the roads in front of your house were bought and you were charged a toll to leave your house? Or, worse yet, you just weren't allowed on the roads?
What if the water source for your city was privately owned? What would prevent them from jacking up the prices? What if you got a good deal with them but your neighbor, under whose house the water pipes ran, decided to not let you have access to it?
Imagine if your house was on fire and you had to call the fire department but they wouldn't come over because your life savings just went up in smoke?
And abolition of all government in general? What, like private minting of money and you having to worry about who takes what currency and if your property is actually yours until the guy with more guns and resources comes over and claims it as his own? I guess there is a sort of romanticism to monarchy. But, seriously, how will any of these issues be solved?

I was responding to a comment that said:


So instead of pointing out the problem that businesses lack transparency (which isn't a problem for business but governments do need to be transparent) and that they need to make a profit (as opposed to government services which are there to specifically provide services), I decided to simplify the argument into one word: "Prisons" since that pretty much relays the points. Now, yeah, governments do have a lot of corruption and need to have a ton more transparency to allow oversight but how many businesses fail and how many businesses can be completely transparent without it affecting their competitiveness?

contradicts your conclusion of:


since then all of the private law enforcement will lobby the government for harsher sentences and expanded powers. We already have civil asset forfeiture being lobbied for by normal government police; imagine what private police forces will start lobbying for.
also what will happen to all of those private companies if crime drops significantly like it has been for the past 20+ years?

Bitcoin is not at all infinite. There can only be 22 million bitcoins in existence.

It's use as a currency is what drives its average value upwards.

Why was this downvoted? This is a very good question as some of us have spare Android devices laying around. So far most of the answers are "You wouldn't want to" which is a weird response as it's our own devices.

It cannot be divided infinitely. It can only be divided into a 100 million units each, each one of those units being called a "Satoshi". There are, if I remember correctly, 22 trillion Satoshis. That's it.

Ah, thanks for providing that! Okay, I wasn't aware of that. I'll need to do more research now.
