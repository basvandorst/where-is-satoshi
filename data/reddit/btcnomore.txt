I don't think that's the same as putting 100 dollars into BTC when it was a dollar and coming out with a million.  Google shares only went up 18.5x since its IPO price.  That same 100 would have only made me 1,850.

Bitcoin only got popular because of the black market.  People needed an anonymous form of currency to buy drugs with, which pushed its value to the hundreds.  Wasn't until people started noticing the glorified price that they started engaging in trading.  If another cryptocurrency gains acceptance in the black market, I will be sure to buy.

So your going to compare actual items that have intrinsic value to a currency which only purpose is to be decentralized and anonymous?  I never understood how the world worked.  If bitcoin had an unlimited supply, then none of you would give a shit about it.

I get mad everyday when I think about how in 2010 I had 1k to invest but couldn't think of any ideas.  Finds out there is bitcoin, but no one fuckin mentions it to me until 2013.  I hate being slow...

but but I thought 100k in 2 yrs...fools.  A man made internet coin is not anywhere near the price of gold, though ill admit, investing during the silk road days was probably the smartest thing you could do.

Realistically think about it like this.  How many people do you know with an extra 10k+ to invest in a speculative market? That should be an indication on how high bitcoin will go.
