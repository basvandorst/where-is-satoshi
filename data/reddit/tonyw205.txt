In a well functioning exchange like nasdaq or nyse maybe, but I dont think bots can accomplish that with broken exchanges which regularly go down. That would be just as risky. What you need is the ability to short at one exchange while being long at the other. I have no found a way to truely short. At poloniex you can be short if you have a long position to short against. Thats the closest i have seen. Need to be able to be short vs usd, not vs btc.

They did finally fix mine after about 2 weeks.

All exchanges have problems, but Poloniex is the only one that I have never received an answer from a support ticket. I have received replies from kraken, coinbase, hitbtc, bittrex, gdax, gemini, exmo, and cex.io, but not a word when i ask Poloniex for help with an issue.

Thats a big IF. How exactly do you get them to respond to tickets. I haven't read where they ever respond to a support ticket. Not exactly a stellar example of customer service.

6 months later would be equivalent to never in this world of crypto volatilty. Thats a travesty.

Even more concerning is their complete lack of response to this. For all they know this could be a multi million dollar transaction. Talk about counterparty risk. This company is asleep at the wheel. Dont risk your money here
