It's full of shit too

Rule  don't use misleading comparisons

Absolutely embarrassing

Your job should be finding a job, not fucking around on the internet reading about shit. Go out and grab life by the ass and give the bitcoin shit a rest until you build some capital for yourself.

I'm glad this worked for you but for anyone thinking of doing the same, for the love of God don't. This is super risky and should Bitcoin crash it will leave you in a brutal spot.
Just because it worked doesn't mean it was smart.

You should read up on this.
There is no "normally". If shorting was always at a positive expected value it would not make sense to take a long position

"earned"

Which expert is not expecting a downtrend in the market at some point in the near future? We've been in a bull market for a while now.

Posts like this are what scare me about Bitcoin. Not the expert naysayers, not the talk of a bubble - the fact that this kind of money is flooding the bitcoin market.

Why would the government increase the circulation of new money?

Go do your own research and decide for yourself, would be my advice

A Goldman Sachs employee broadcasting to the world what the firm intends to do with futures... Sounds legit 
@_date: 2018-05-14 03:19:21
This is hands down the stupidest thing I've ever seen on reddit. The fact that this is up voted so far is ridiculous 
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:39:54
This sub is so deluded that I can't actually tell if this is sarcasm

Put the Guy Fawkes mask away dude
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:16:52
The fact that this nonsense is so well received here is frightening

"we are pioneers of a new financial system"
You have got to be fucking kidding
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:13:42
Holy fuck is this sub close to reaching enlightened levels of euphoria

You are. 
You pay for your own college? You just said you put nearly every penny to your name into Bitcoin. How much do you pay for tuition? Books? Rent? Utilities? Food? And where are you working currently?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:06:08
So your parents don't give you any money for tuition, books, rent etc then? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:37:21
what do you do for work?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:06:03
You're an adult, yet still living under their roof, and acting like this. You should be more thankful to your parents you insufferable twat
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:21:34
You just used value as a noun ya yutz

You don't have house insurance?
