Wow indeed. Very interested in seeing a lot more on this being from Mexico City. I did cross posted this over at the G+ Bitcoin Community. One nitpic is that you should start calling it what it is. A CEM. Currency Exchange Machine. Whether it is one way or two ways, that term remains accurate.

Still don't believe them it was technical issues. I used it and I really believe it was Paypal cutting them off or Paypal cutting BIPS off because of what flattr facilitated which in essence was a premium but surefire safe once-a-month Bitcoin to paypal to bank gateway. That makes the whole thing more of a policy issue. Flattr has fucked up too many times now. I really think ChangeTip, Patreon and Ziibra will replace it fine.

Heh, a bit surprised I got downvoted.  But whatever. I saw the info on 8 bids.  And in none neither insinuations, admissions or rumors indicate anyone bidding over market value at the time of auction. I wonder if the reason my speculation got downvoted is because many here want to believe the winning bids were over market value at time of auction? But for me that don't makes any sense either. Specially when you are talking about that many millions of dollars.  Yet, it was not what I could find out or what rumors say. Only will believe it if USM says it or an actual big player shows evidence of it.

1.- The theft of 15 BTC. 2.- They started monetizing quite late and by the end they were getting to close to red as traffic was growing a lot higher than revenue. 3.- They were understaffed. But because of problem 1 and 2, they could not hire more people without going to red.

I have not used this. Will look into it. But I do must clear that depending on how much you spend between exchange rate and pademobile cut. It will cost anywhere from 5% to 15% to use Bitcoin this way. the possible reason for this move is that dominant mini-markets chain in Mexico rolled out a service that is very much so a rip-off of zipzap. Just without the Bitcoin Support.

Placing Dogecoin as the third stretch goal instead of the second was a mistake. Who cares about Peercoin? It will still be able to reach the Litecoin stretch goal for sure.

I can bet you it will barely reach 1TB by its 10th anniversary. Right now a good 1TB 2.5" USB 3.0 external HDD is only $99 USD with shipping included. 4.5 years from now I can bet a good 3TB 2.5" external HDD will be like $99 USD. Also in context? a high-performance 128gb MicroSD from sandisk is right now $125 USD. 4.5 years from now a 1TB MicroSD should be around $125 USD. Basically you are worrying about nothing since even when it comes to portable storage holding 1TB of data is already cheap.

After reviewing the rumored and insinuations on bids prices. Everyone that lost seem to have done bids from $400 to $550. Meaning that the winning bid must had been the closest to market value at the time of auction. So, the winning bid was between $550 and $600 from what it seems. If so, the guy who won possibly already has seen his investment appreciate in less than a week.

It is not just simple speculation. It is based on her own recollection of the events being "around 5 years ago" generating the following facts:1.- It fits for when Second Life was at the top of the news on a weekly basis. 2.- At that time no one, not even Satoshi himself had hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins to blow. Based on those two facts, it cannot have been Bitcoin was she is talking about and only Linden Dollars.

Just to reiterate on reason of why it closed: 1.- It started monetizing late and not in a optimal way, 2.- It got robbed anywhere from 80 to 800BTC depending on what rumor you believe, 3.-It was truly growing too fast. At the end they had over 35,000 listings at any given moment and were well over 1 million of page views a day. I mean, I was there and remember it going from 3,500 listings to 35,000 in like a year so they probably were running out of money fast. One thing they did complained on the record is that the site had got too hard to manage and that they felt it had got over their heads.

Really simple: Multi signature wallet. You give a key to each beneficiary and maybe one to the lawyer/notary that holds your living will. You seal that one in a tamperproof certificate that only gets revealed of its true nature when your will is read. Only way to rip you off is with you still living and even then the lawyer/notary would need to know beforehand what is in the tamperproof certificate and collude with all of your beneficiaries.

Hey Laura. I wanted to buy it but I found it a bit off that Shopify didn't had a direct payment process for Bitcoin and I had to register fully to it. Would be better if you had a direct process to pay for it with Bitpay or Coinbase.  It would reduce greatly the friction and in turn generate more sales for the single.

Good luck with that. But if you wanted the code. There were rumors they sold it. I have used pretty much all of the Bitcoin based Open Web Marketplaces that have been. From the 7 or so I have used. No doubt in my mind the best one and closest to replacing Bitmit is CryptoThrift. Hands down. Coingig was quite bad. Bitdazzle is so-so. Bitshack is almost ok. Bitwasp is not finished. OpenBazaar is a year from being anywhere ready for it to be used. Etc, etc. But you can check for yourself.

Unlikely. LocalBitcoins got a huge advantage in the fact nothing really competes 1-1 with it and having being around for this long with a good reputation gives it a massive visibility edge. Then there is the fact it don't even works right at all yet. Not even on Ubuntu. It is even worse in OS X am told. And there is not even a Windows Build yet. I am highly skeptical they will deliver anything resembling a RTM-quality 1.0 build before 2015. Since they are calling an Alpha, a Beta right now. However, if somehow OpenBazaar surpasses LocalBitcoins it will be 2-3 years from now.  And no, I am not hating on OpenBazaar. I want it to succeed. Just being brutally honest.

Yeah. I noticed like 2 months ago. They used BIPS. I did used it, so I know. Do not believe them on the technical issues. More likely is that they didn't liked people were using it as a safe Bitcoin to Paypal gateway or Paypal noticed this was happening and threatened to cut them off. And given they recently announced many changes they are doing to the service for when you fund or receive funds from Flattr. I now doubt they will be re-adding Bitcoin at all. It is a shame because their new changes are just pointless. Flattr could had easily beaten ChangeTip and the like if they had pivoted the service with Bitcoin as an integral part of it. I don't see how their latest changes will make them more successful when what they have is a friction+process problem and the fact they have to have a high-fee charge for them.

But it don't matters that it was said the quotes were accurate when the details about them reveal that that is not exactly completely true. 1.- Only one quote is confirmed as had happened while at the same time revealing it didn't happened exactly like newsweek report leads you to believe it happened. 2.- The important "smoking gun" quote words were not confirmed. But since we now know the other quote didn't happened like it reads in newsweek report, this only casts more doubt on what exactly were the words and makes dorian statement on being misunderstood stronger. But sure, if we take a second hand general statement as 100% true on all details while ignoring the actual details given, then sure that they are "accurate".

Given that anywhere from 31 to 50 million dollars have been invested on it and that it is Silicon Valley based means it would never take less than 10x what it has been invested in it since it still a startup that is on a ramp up and seen with multi-year good growth potential. That gives you the base price of Coinbase to sell would be $310M-$500M USD. But since it has not reached a plateau in growth or potential. They probably could or would be asking for twice that which would mean a $1B USD price tag as the top price for it right now. However, I doubt Paypal would be willing to pay that for it right now. And there is no certainity Coinbase would be willing to sell right now.

No,he didn't.  He backed the possibility for the quotes to have happened. He backed one quote while revealing that Leah tweaked and edited her own recollection of events to fit her narrative. But what is important is that the quote that was not backed, based on this report is the one in conflict about he being involved. How this translates into a headline that says  that he did backed the quotes is based on ABCnews stretching half a lie and half a truth into true somehow.

Yeah. that is true.

Ugh. Once again some are relying on made up quotes of the other quotes being accurate and not recordings. 
Here is what the deputy actually said: 
"They had a dialogue, the deputies stood there and they were there while the two people were working things out," said Parker. "The gentleman didn't want to participate. He said enough for those quotes to be made and that was pretty much a wrap."
Parker added that the deputy quoted in the story didn't know about the mystery behind bitcoin's creator prior to the call. After the reporter explained more about who she believed Nakamoto to be, that's when the deputy made the quote, "This is the guy who created Bitcoin? It looks like he's living a pretty humble life."

Cointerest is a better Bitcoin Map. But regardless. Then have a look at Dallas and then at Los Angeles. L.A is actually the  in Bitcoin Adoption and where is the easiest to live on Bitcoin because of jobs that pay in bitcoin, stuff like fiverr and because of Bridging Services (snapcard,gift, egifter, etc) work there the best. For me it was a surprise to see how L.A just got ahead of the pack.  Florida is also indeed interesting. And with the whole Bitcoin Bowl thing there, I can imagine it will reach new heights in the state.

The Lilly Allen factoid is wrong. She was offered Linden Dollars. Only Satoshi had hundreds of thousands of BTC in 2009 and they would had been worth $100 USD. $1000USD in 2010. And then why someone inside SL in 2009-2010 would be offering anything than LD for an In-SL audio stream? She completely misremembered.

Yeah, they can also use coin pocket and coinpunk and pin those tabs or make them app windows.  That would mean 5 bitcoin wallet apps that work for ChromeOS because they are browser "docked". I would never use ChromeOS as main OS but even I know that as you can make it run from an USB within Windows 8 Metro UIX. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 06:46:12
I think the reasons why he has only seen 10,000 downloads is simply because 1.- Coinjar never went away for iOS , 2.- People that had the blockchain.info app already, just kept using it,  3.- Someone in Bitcoin using iOS may be just waiting on a new app from Coinbase or blockchain.info, 4.- Thousands of iOS Bitcoiners just defected to Android.

It is not based on Bitcoin. It is based on Bittorrent Streaming Apps. It first started at Russia in late 2010. Then it was a premium feature in Vuze and uTorrent. Then a few apps here and there and then finally this year all got put up together in the NodeJS based open source app from Popcorn Time. This seems to be yet another fork or reinterpretation of Popcorn Time.

I have done 30 transactions so far in Cryptothrift. 20 buys, 10 sells. I got 3 accounts there. It is the closest to fully replace Bitmit. By year end i think they will have done it and CryptoThirft will be as good as Bitmit was and it will finally have enough stuff being sold in it.

For them it must have been a case of they not wanting to reinvent the service. Because they would do have to pivot it for it to truly adapt to it being more than it can be the way it is.. Patreon is taking on flattr and changetip is months away to expand into facebook and google+. If changetip starts doing TipJar site badges + their own site directory. Flattr would be done within 6 months of that happening.

There were many reasons why it failed on the campaign alone: 1.- The ask was super high for BitcoinStarter. 1K BTC. 2.- It was not even in Beta. 3.- Not known devs.
Then it targeted music which is saturated. Even for indies you got tons of options. Problems is most musicians don't seem to want to go beyond targeting YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and iTunes.

Hello everyone. I am Avatar X and I also happen to be one of the co-owner and lead admin of the G+ Bitcoin Community.
Same one that is listed in Bitcoin.org. So far with 2,770 members.
While it would be a bit weird to consider joining a Google Plus based community for many of you. It is important to remember that the good things about it, is that it got all the resources and amenities to accommodate a good experience. 
If you need more reasons. Also know I moderate source repetition, reroute repeated questions and filter posts to relevant sections myself. So the experience of the home stream in it is quite clean.
So, hopefully you will consider it.

Wrong. Sony in a desperate move paid an "incentive" of $400M to WB so they would decide to go Blu-ray. And an unknown amount to Disney and Fox previous or after that. That was never confirmed. Blu-ray was losing.  But HD-DVD group would had won if they would had managed to convince Bill Gates to use it in the Xbox 360 and to ship direct Windows support right away. They didn't on the Xbox 360 and Microsoft was not able to ship HD-DVD support for Windows until Anti-Trust oversight approved it. Ballmer famously had to demand that the AO allowed them to ship the Burn-to-DVD feature in Vista RTM Build. Otherwise Vista would have also had HD-DVD support out of the box.

It ties to the WP8 Wallet. You can use Coinbase and blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:40:32
There are basically only 3 things you can do. 1.- Check the address in Blockchain.info while logged in with a Blockchain.info account. If the receiving wallet is marked with an identifier, you will be able to see it. 2.- Send a message with a very small amount  pleading your case. 3.- Send a small amount with a Coinbase account. If the receiving wallet is hosted in Coinbase, when you load up details on the transaction, their coinbase email will show up to you.
@_date: 2013-08-04 00:54:20
My only problem with it is that it don`t degrades well. Causes problems in sites when seen in IE8. I had noted it until i decided to check if it worked or not. While i was checking that, i was surprised to see Coinbase Button does degrades. Not gracefully as it becomes a link. But hey.
