There haven't been so many contracts issued to make a dent in the price.
The reason price goes down around the time of futures expiring is that people think that price it will go down around the time futures are expiring.
It goes back up afterwards, because people believe it will go up. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

You're literally saying POS designed to increase security, will do just the opposite. I would love to hear your reasoning behind this.
If an average crypto "investor" / user has to decide between using something that is very secure and usable right now, such as ETH, and something which is 10 times as secure as that, but completely unusable, they will go with ease of use every time. Unless there is hype rally, which it seems has ran out for Bitcoin.
The average crypto investor won't tell you what a Satoshi is, let alone how many decimal places BTC has. That's the level of the knowledge we're working with here. Imagine explaining what a 51% attack is and why it matters.
They care about hype, reputation and ease of use. In this order. And Bitcoin has ran out of all three.

So you don't believe "shills" pointing out weakness of Bitcoin, but you are perfectly willing to suspect your disbelieve for shills saying POS is crap?
Buying big ticket items is fine, but how often do you do that? And by the same logic, since you can't buy anything but big ticket items with it, it's a bad currency. Newsflash, people buy groceries more often than TVs. When you need a workaround like LN to make a feature usable for what it originally offered, it is a broken feature.
Hell, even drug dealers moved away from Bitcoin.

Yeah. It will go up. It might take three years like the last time, but it will go up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:36:42
There is still significant amount of greed around. "Investors" who sold want to get back in. Just because "it always goes up". I suspect there will be significant dead cat bounces counting in tens of percent over the next few weeks. After that, the price is likely gonna stagnate at around the 4-6k mark, because media will stop talking about Bitcoin growing xxxx%, which is what led to the hype spike we've seen before Christmas.
Then we'll see what happens after that. If LN takes off, we might get another hype rally, this time wrapped as "Bitcoin got fixed! Now it's more coin than before!!1!". But that's no guarantee. It's possible that some other alt-coin will take over before LN gets out. I'm betting on one of those anonymity coins that are actually being used to purchase 'products' on that part of the Internet we no longer seem to speak of in here.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:36:01
Is that the only thing Bitcoin has going for it? Most other cryptos are unstoppable, unseizable and uncontrollable. Some are even truly anonymous. What is the selling feature of Bitcoin then?
Let me tell you: reputation. It was first. It is the most known. That's it.
In every other aspect, virtually any other crypto currency matches Bitcoin's capability, or exceeds it.
And now the reputation has been tarnished by all the mainstream investors who bought above 16k before Christmas, and lost money immediately. They won't buy back. All the other people who were thinking of getting into Bitcoin won't, because of what they saw happened during holiday.
On top of that, you should also add un-transferrable to your list of features. The primary tool, the original selling point of crypto currency, the blockchain, too bogged down to be used. The entire community is waiting for the LN workaround to save Bitcoin. Quite a financial tool indeed.
The drive behind Bitcoin going above 4k was hype. And that's where it's going to fall down to, as "investors" sober up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:23:15
You're on a wrong sub-reddit. BCH shills congregate on This clever boy registered Bitcoin.com, because it is similar in name to Bitcoin's official homepage Bitcoin.org, and went on to create a Bitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash BCH.
When people didn't want his fake Bitcoin, he went to media as "CEO and founder of Bitcoin.com", and told everyone he sold BTC for BCH, in order to push his fake coin further. Jokes on him, he got misquoted by mainstream media around the world as "BITCOIN FOUNDER SODL HIS BITCOIN!!1!1". Tanking price of both BTC and his fake Bitcon Crash.
It's what started this whole market reversal. So yeah, be careful where you post that link.

It's not about how fast you can move money out of the exchange. It is about how fast you can move your Bitcoin to the exchange to sell it. The mempool did not get as bogged down in 2013 as it did in last week's selloff.
The sheer amount of transactions filling the mempool is what prevented even more drastic sell-off than we've seen.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:05:32

51% attack for ETH, which is the second biggest crypton, would at current hashrate, which sits at around 150 TH/s, and no doubt would go up if the demand for ETH and its price went up, be about $2b just for GPUs. This makes this type of attack non-viable for average "technical person" or evil corporation. Nobody has $2b just lying around to spend on cracking crypto.
But you could go the high-tech way and design and produce a few hundred ASICs to take over the market at today's hashrate. A small-scale production will cost you a ~$10mm. No biggie. But at that point you have spent $10mm with a very questionable return on investment. So there is no way you're getting your money back.
That leaves this attack only in scope of governments, wanting to destroy it. Fair point, but that brings up cost of mass producing your own ASICs. At current hashrate of 20000 PH/s you would need about 2mm ASIC processors. In comparison, Intel sells ~700mm/year, so those are rookie numbers. Sure, it would probably cost you ~$100mm to design and produce those processors, or about 10 Abrams tanks, but remember, you're the evil government attacking crypto. And I'm giving you very reasonable cost per unit ($50). On scale of millions of processors, a single-purpose processors would likely cost you under one dollar anyway, so giving you $50 for the rest of the unit, which does not have to be a standalone over-the-counter device, is pretty generous.
In other words, on the scale of crypto, the BTC attack will cost merely 10x as much, as ETH attack. Which is by far not something you can call unmatched security.
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:01:58
How do they handle the high transaction fees for day-to-day purchases? Do they just factor in that $15 purchase costs twice as much thanks to the fees?
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:09:07
No reputable exchange will accept transactions from accounts associated with illegal activity. Whoever stole them had to launder the coins hard and long, making them unusable for a large period of time, therefore reducing availability.
My point was precisely that there was a psychological message that BTC is not safe. And that this message with return.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:12:10
Bitcoin is store of faith as well. Calling it "gold standard" is a meme. It has no value above its transaction usefulness and trust placed onto it by people who bought in. If the trust goes, the value goes as well.
The story about Venezuela has one major flaw: you can't buy bread with Bitcoin, without paying $20 transaction fee. My point remains, it is useless for day-to-day transactions, because the primary tool, its main value proposition, the blockchain, is unusable for daily-to-day expenses.
Limited supply means jack. There is a limited supply of a lot of things. The price only goes up, if the demand goes up. And the demand we've seen over past few weeks was based on hype.

I'm not discussing why public lost trust in Bitcoin now, as opposed to 2013, I'm describing how the crash rolled on. 
But yeah, you're right. IIRC, it was down 60% within month or so. Then slowly bled to the 80% low. We've gone 50% down in less than two weeks. We are sill ahead of the schedule.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:55:13
Do want to have lost half, or all of your investment?
Bitcoin is going to go way down, until it goes back up. If it goes back up. A lot of mainstream investors lost a lot of money buying the per-Christmas ATH. They won't be coming back any time soon, severely slowing down mainstream adoption.

When it goes way up way fast, it drops back quite a bit a short while later.
It went to 20k when media first picked up on the story about this amazing Bitcoin that gave 10x ROI and everybody and their grandmother wanted on board, driving demand up. If you remember your Economy 101, demand drives price up.
When the price stopped growing. Partially because exchanges could not keep up with the demand, and closing registrations, strangling the influx of new investors. Partially because the pool of early-hype-mass-adopters has exhausted anyway.
If you are a shoe shiner who bought something they don't understand, because you were told it will go up for reasons you don't know, and it stops going up for reasons you don't understand, you sell. Enough people sell, the price goes down.
Then your grandma figures out she lost 20% of her investment in a week and sells, driving price even lower.
This way panic sellers drive the price way bellow long term mean. At which point people with rudimentary economic skills jump in, and buy now under-priced asset. Now, a lot of people are buying the dip. What do you think happens? Price goes up! What happens when price goes up? Your grandma sees the price is going up after all, and buys back in.
Then the whole cycle repeats over again a few times.
Then some dude who bought domain Bitcoin.com (no relation to official Bitcoin.org) goes to mainstream media, telling them Bitcoin is dead! I sold all of it for my new coin Bitcoin Cash (BCH!), and is promptly misquoted as: "Bitcoin founder says it's all over and sells out!". This drives price of both Bitcoin, and his Bitcon Crash down.
Then a new year comes, and Americunts have to file their taxes. So they sell the most liquid asset first before the end of the December, so it is included in the last year's statement. If you were paying attention, you know what happens when a lot of people want to sell at the same time. But, it turns out it happens every year, so the price goes up again fast. But not nearly as much as it was before. 
Then a Chinese new year comes, the year of the Doge, and Chinks have to pay their taxes. So they sell the most liquid asset first. If you were paying attention, you know what happens when a lot of people want to sell at the same time.  But, it turns out it happens every year, so the price goes up again fast. But not nearly as much as it was before. 
At the same time, there a lot of FUD news releases, describing "imminent and total" ban of concurrency across multiple major markets. People who read only headlines sell. At his point you should be telling me, what happens when a lot of people want to sell at the same time.
So, Bitcoin is hit by post-mainstream hype, two new year tax seasons and several major FUD news within 3 weeks. Followed by "BITCOIN CRASHED. WE TOLD YOU SO!" stories in media.
Now everybody is sitting in front of their technical analysis runes, trying to figure out if 9k is as low as it will go, and people have already changed their diapers, or if this bounce back is just a dead cat bounce, combined with weekend fresh blood, and we [will go deeper]( on Monday.
Also, grandma is pissed, because she got drunk and slept through her 9k notification, failing to buy back in as she planned.

@_date: 2018-01-24 09:37:48
Only if you believe in karma. And I don't mean Reddit karma.
First, lightning is not ready for live transactions. Devs still lose money on testnet.
Second, the whole network was designed to be highly competitive, with zero cost to entry. If you try to charge 1 satoshi on that cryptolate transaction, there will be plenty other people willing to charge nothing.
Your paid node would therefore only be used for large transactions, where no other node free has sufficient funds. But at the same time, such transactions are more likely to happen on blockchain. This puts you in position where paid nodes are too expensive for small transactions at even 1 satoshi, but at the same time irrelevant for large transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:18:07
Bitcoin stopped growing, so the influx of new "investors" ended, which made the price go down. That made even more people sell.

Yes, I fully agree with your logic.
But BTC market is not logical. If it was logical, the loss of 650k of BTC would be a welcome decrease of immediate supply, and therefore based on supply / demand economy law lead to increased price.
And yet, it didn't. Because emotions.
As you're saying a loss of approximately 80k BTC, and hell, it was not even BTC, should be a spit in a bucket. It should be quickly forgotten and ignored by everyone.
And yet, it didn't. Because emotions.
It reminds everybody Bitcoin is not safe. There are no guarantees. It's you vs the world of people who know more about computers than you. Fear triumphs over logic.

The only thing stronger than greed is fear. That's whats driving current selloff. The fear will drive it back bellow 5-7k, and settle around 8k. But yeah, I do agree that 4k is an unlikely scenario.
When the dust settles, all the "investors" will leave Bitcoin alone, and make it a viable payment method again. Maybe then the greed cycle could begin again. The question is, if Bitcoin's reputation has not been irreversibly tarnished.

@_date: 2018-01-24 09:55:58
I'm not a tax advisor. Talk to an accountant. But the general rule of thumb is that you pay for realized profit. Every realized profit.
That means if you invested $50k and SODL to gain $100k, you pay capital gains tax on $50k
If you then used the $100k to buy in at ATH, and still keep the asset, you are still liable for tax on the $50k you earned earlier.
[Here is where it gets complicated.](
Now, depending on your exact tax code, and this is where you really should check with a bookie, **if you would sell at loss now** for $50k, you can claim the investment loss against the original gain of $50k and avoid paying taxes.
But this is **not** how it works **everywhere**. In most countries tax laws, you can only claim loss for future investment gains. I.e. you are still liable for tax on your initial gain, but can subtract your newly realized loss of 50k against any potential future gainz.
This is of course only if you were to sell now, and re-bought BTC lower, for more profit.
And this is gets even more complicated. If you are in US, and bought before the end of the year, the books are closed. You have to pay the tax either way. You can't claim current financial year's loss in last financial year's taxes.
tl;dr: You owe Uncle Sam 8k in taxes.
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:38:38
Comparing bad asset in terms of even worse asset does not make it a good asset.
But hey, more than twice the amount of money was stolen now, than was stolen from Mt. Gox. So that means this time it's gonna take 6 years to get back to where it is now.
And who knows when it's gonna get to the 20k half of the poor "investors" in here bought for.
But I guess it comes to your risk profile. Some people just love loooong term investments.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:49:51
Bitcoin was a powder keg before Roger happened.
Bogged transaction log making Bitcoin unusable for everyday payments, the forkening of BTC, alt-coin pump-and-dumps diverting money from BTC and the meme-driven hype rally drawing in more and more people who didn't know what BTC is, but knew it was always going to go up! 
Add on top of that the invisible stuff. Korea, Russia and China deciding crypto is too big to ignore. Bitfinex issuing Tether under suspicious circumstances.
That makes it a gas-soaked powder keg.

Jokes aside, it's gonna be back up by Wednesday. Today morning, the general population in London got hit in the face with full page article about Bitcoin rising to 60k in 2018. With the current number of people joining every day, it's gonna take 2-3 days for the accounts of new people joining to be confirmed. Then they start trading, which is gonna drive the price up.
On top of that, on Sunday, wall street starts trading BTC futures. And they saw the same thing I saw, so we might not even have to wait till Wednesday.

Initially I thought the price was gonna crash harder this time, because in my mind it was being propped up mostly by newcomers boarding the hype train, who would GTFO. I expected it to crash down to 2k. But the bleed is too slow for that. I'm actually reconsidering adjusting it to 5k, but not quite decided yet.

Yes, but as inefficient mining operations are forced out of the market, the hashrate, and by extension complexity, will go down, lowering the cost price.

Even now, so many people got burnt by the hype, that Bitcoin is only slowly recovering its reputation among the general population. And Bitcoin needs the general population. If general population does not trust it, it will never stop being that scammy thing neckbeards meme about on the internet. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:58:42
The price doesn't to anything on its own.
People who come to Bitcoin because of its (now nonexistent) utility, buy the exact amount they need. They transfer it to target. And they're done. The risk of price fluctuation is minimal, and usually factored into price. These people don't keep Bitcoin, but active circulation tends to rise price long-term.
This draws in investors, who buy long-term. They don't care too much if bitcoin goes up one month, and down another. They bought large amounts of Bitcoin before any such bubble occurred, so they don't lose anything during so called "crash".
But when the price rises too fast, it over-inflates the price. This draws in new money, in form of get-rich-quick "investors". This in turn drives the price even higher. They have no idea what they are buying, or why other people value it. They just see it's growing XXX%! That's how bubbles form.
If you are a smart investor, when such bubble occurs, you offload your asset to the poor schmucks who didn't do their research, and re-buy a few months later when the price stabilizes. If you need any Bitcoin for transactions in the mean time, you just buy an exact amount from market.

Let me guess, you bought the dip at 13k and need to dollar average?
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:47:35
Depends on how much he pays for power, what he mines, and how much did he pay for the card.
He is probably paying around $0.12 kW/h of energy (US average), and just the card (again, lets be generous and not cound rest of the rig, and things like AC) takes 0.125 kW/h
If he joins pool, he'll pay 1% fee. But let's be generous and say it's 0.
With hashrate of 32MH/s, he earns $55/month per card:
Now, lets be generous and say he got his cards at MSRP $550. Good luck getting one at that price, let alone 300k's worth. In which case he'll get his money back in 10 months. That is, if the price stops dropping right the fuck now, and does not go any lower.
But let's be realistic. He probably paid closer to 800 for each card. That's the average betwen MSRP of $550 and what you can see the card for now, which is $1000. That would mean ROI of 14 months. Again, provided current price holds.
If he's a dumbass, he bought at current "market price" of the card, and dropped a grand on each. That means he'll be re-paying them for 18 months.
With taxes, this gets significantly longer, but if he's business, he can subtract cost of cards from the income, which should lower his taxes.
Here's a big catch. At any point in time he can go and sell his cards, to recover rest of his money. How much he recovers depends on the market. Keep in mind that a lot of people will make the same calculation, and flood the market with used high-performance cards, tanking their price.
If you want to be nice, say he'll get half the price for the card after half of the time (good luck with that). That would mean he's back to zero after roughly half the time. But he'll also have to pay-back any tax he lowered by purchasing those cards in the first place.
tl;dr: ~10-18 months minimum, if he keeps the hardware. ~5-9 if he re-sells the hardware at break even for half the price. But a lot longer if he pays taxes.

No. The net neutrality was supposed to ensure that the internet service provider cannot fuck with your Internet. Keeping the Internet free and open to everyone. Now internet providers can restrict what websites you can access at what speeds, and outright block your access.
One example from many: Comcast extorted money from Netflix, by throttling their connection. And before you jump to conclusion, no, this was explicit throttling / traffic shaping. Not a lack of connectivity. It was proven that if you masked your traffic, for example through VPN, you did get Netflix at full speed, as the rest of your internet.
Basically, what Comcast said is that we don't give a fuck you have valid deals with ISPs connecting to our network. You, you specifically, will pay for the privilege of having access to our customers. They used their own clients as hostages.
They are suing them for it right now.
It is entirely correct that official net neutrality was not codified until 2015. But all this time since inception of the Internet, FCC was heavily pro-net neutrality. They just didn't have tools to enforce it. Review some of their pre-2015 policies, and stop re-regurgitating what cable provider shills got in your head.

I respect those who keept HODLing because they believe the technology. It is not financially sensible stance, but I understand they got in for reasons other than financial gain.
I respect those who invested into Bitcoin long term, and will keep it for next decade, because they believe it will go up higher than 20k. I disagree, but respect their opinion.
I don't respect those who bought in around 8k, learning about Bitcoin from news, held through all peaks, claiming it's gonna go to 100k, bro! And acted smug about "making" 3x on paper.
Its people like that who fall for get-rich-quick schemes. This time they got lucky and came across one that temporarily gained enough traction to get off the ground. Except they drank the Kool-aid and failed to make a swift exit.

The volatility of past few months is relatively new occurrence. It did not fluctuate nearly as much fore the latest exponential growth.
Even then, multi-currency payments are pretty common scenario. For example, since UK is (still) member of EU, its businesses have to accept EUR along UK's GBP. But everything is priced in GBP. Every business has current exchange rate between GBP and EUR posted in their business, so you can re-calculate the price.
On-line payments in bitcoin are the same. Usually, everything is priced against businesses fiat currency (i.e. GBP/USD). The price is then listed either in this currency, or as real-time converted Bitcoin value. When you decide to pay, the amount is fixed for a period of time, for you to make the transfer. I've seen as low as 30 minute fixations.
In other words, same principle, shorter timeframe.

No, it was absolutely designed as currency from the very beginning, by this buy called Satoshi. Maybe you've heard of him: [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System]( 
The "it's not currency, it's a store of value" meme came about only after Bitcoin failed to scale and transactions became prohibitively expensive.
The fact there is limited amount of Bitcoin plays no part in this. There is limited number of gold and silver, and it was historically used as currency.
And no, it was not designed to have a tremendous amount of growth. The idea its value will grow over time thanks to deflation is part of the design, but rapid swings in value are not. That's mania's work.

By boycotting blocks with "too low" fee, you are artificially inflating transaction fees.
By inflating transaction fees when market is headed to the shitter, you are driving buyers who want to use Bitcoin for actual transaction to other shitcoins. I.e. Someone wanting to buy that medical marijuana from Silk road will prefer Bcrash over Bitcoin, because it has lower fees. That means it will have the benefit of demand.

I don't think you could enforce network-wide fee even with 51% consensus / attack (semantics).
My point is it sets the precedent. It says to the market and other miners there is a group of people who won't do business with you, unless pay them x amount of fee. As long as there are miners out there willing to include your transaction for free, that's fine. But it puts forward the idea it is not "the only way" to operate.

It's still too high, but just a few more k and I'm buying back in. What a ride!

We'll have to agree to disagree on that. After all, to my knowledge, Satoshi never addressed what a reasonable fee is.
So I guess it comes down to personal opinion. In my opinion, price of Bitcoin was built up by its circulation through common online transactions. After all, it can only store as much value, as others are willing to pay you for it. This means it will be superseded, if it cannot be used for common payments, which may impact its price over time. But that's speculation of course.
I've had a reality check, when I had to use BCH to buy stuff online, because I wasn't willing to pay premium of 10% on $60 transaction.

The reason is feedback loop.
* Believers started buying Bitcoin, because it is the future of Internet transactions.
* People buying Bitcoin caused the price to go up.
* Tech-background investors started buying Bitcoin, because it has shown stable value increase over time.
* People buying Bitcoin caused the price to go up.
* Mainstream investors learned of Bitcoin from news.
* People buying Bitcoin caused the price to go up.
* Get-rich-quick "investors" learned of Bitcoin from news.
* People buying Bitcoin caused the price to go up.
* Exchanges couldn't keep up with the demand, and influx of "investors" stopped.
* Lack of new money caused smart people to sell.
* People selling caused the price to go down.
* Price going down caused normal people to sell.
* People selling caused the price to go down.
* Price going down caused not so smart people to sell.
* People selling caused the price to go down.
The prevalent FUD in news served as an accelerant to the crash.
Now we're waiting till Bitcoin hits the bottom of die-hard HODLers, and things go back to normal.

It doesn't. Usually. What you're seeing are short-term effects of bubble pop. Things will settle down. Go on your favorite exchange, and zoom out. There was not nearly as much volatility as there is in past few weeks.

The biggest issue with no net neutrality is that Internet provider can throttle or outright block connection to specific services.
So, one feared scenario is return to cable-age packages. I.e. your base connection gives you access to Yahoo, MySpace and BlockBuster. Want Gmail, Facebook and Amazon? That will be in our "advanced" package! Want access to Coinbase? Try our crypto package! Want GDAX? That's what our advanced crypto package is for!
Something like that would kill adoption rate for general public.
Worst case scenario is: "Comcast does not allow access to crypto currency related sites, since their content is not compatible with our company family values." (or because big banks compensated us for blocking the access).
No net neutrality means anything goes, as long as it generates profit! It's not like unregulated capitalism in high-cost-to-entry field with a handful of big players controlling the market ever backfired. Right? Right?

I'd do it.
If I were 70 and still reasonably fit, and knew that I had maybe 10-15 years to live as frail old man, I'd exchange those years to be able to spend 1 or 2 years on Mars, and die of Mars' harsh environment.
And I'm not the only one.

People using money is one thing.
Devs deciding to re-implement parts of the protocol is another. Imagine you're a Lightning dev, and you found that some part of the protocol is unfeasible (basically you've coded yourself into a corner). That happens all the time when you create prototypes. That's *why* you create prototypes.
So now you've completely rewritten not just the code, but also huge part of the protocol. It now works as it should, but is, let's say slower, because you had to add more safety checks to make it more secure or whatever.
Well, lets say that there are people who liked the faster version of the protocol. So they decide to fork the protocol, and not upgrade and use the obsolete version, creating a second Lightning network. Congratulations, now you've fractured the community.
This introduces politics into software development. That's one thing you don't want in software development.
This is just a made up example. A million similar scenarios can come up that would not be a problem on test net, because it's a fucking test net. It's where problems are *meant* to occur. Now you have to keep in mind that anything you push to repo has to work, or people will lose money.

A lot of people said that about 9k too. Yet, here we are.

I don't believe Bitcoin can hold long term at what it is now. The sooner we're at reasonable trading price, which in my book is between 1-4k, I'll be confident recommending buying and holding again.
But when I see mainstream investors leaving in droves, and selling their Bitcoin bags to believers at inflated prices, which will go down further, I have to warn as many people as possible.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:22:49
I was originally thinking 4k as well. That would be crash to 80% of ATH. Like Mt. Gox crash.
But due to the power of last few day's sell-off, I've reconsidered. The scale of mainstream investors is staggering. They will dip sell-offs till around 2-1k. Then it might swing back up to 3-4k and stay there long term.

Bitcoin is still bearish. This was larger than usual dead cat bounce.
We're sub $5.5k bound.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:13:43
Well, I suppose you're right. Owning 51% you could simply ignore any blocks mined by miners who don't charge fees. But at that point Bitcoin would have bigger problems than someone charging or not charging fees.

Still, the big question is how much will it cost to build a manned module for Falcon heavy, capable of landing and taking off again.
Even, arguably, the best reusable tech we have right now, which is a Falcon first stage / booster, requires about a month of refurbishing to replace damaged components after landing. Designing and testing a manned module capable of the same thing, without having to rely on industrial-level refurbishing, will be a challenge order of a magnitude harder than dropping tools, food and shelter on Mars, and sending colonists one way.
That being said, I am in no way expert on economy of interplanetary transport. So don't quote me on that.

Anyone planning one-way trip, which just so happens to come at about 1/5th to 1/10th the price of return trip.
A "frail old man" with a hand drill, can do more in day's worth of work, than all the automated probes and rovers did in all of the 40 years of Mars exploration.
But that's beside the point. I said I'd go, if I were still reasonably fit, to avoid becoming a frail old man. Reading comprehension much?
The whole point is that if I'm fit at 70, but know my health will likely deteriorate in next 10 years, I am more than happy to spend next 2 still-fit years doing something useful for the mankind.

I was certain the community would blame the fall of Bitcoin on plenty of different causes. But I never expected it would blame memers.

@_date: 2018-02-05 14:14:03
It's not worth nothing. It's worth exactly how much other people are willing to give you for it. Like any other currency.
The price is falling, because it got inflated by influx of get-rich-quick "investors" who had no idea what Bitcoin is, apart from the fact it grew hundreds or percent this year!!1!
These "investors" are not selling at loss. Things are getting to where they were before the bubble. Life goes on. We're just waiting to see where the price settles.
My bet is anywhere between $1-3k

No. Old school true believer HODLers were attracted to Bitcoin because of fast low-fee transaction.
This "store of value" meme came about when greedy miners decided that high fees are a good thing, and that Bitcoin shouldn't be a currency, and went against increasing block size. This is a part of reason why we've had so many damn forks, with Roger Ver and his Bitcon Crash leading the pack.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:07:47
Bitcoin was crated for a purpose. That's why I'm talking about its creation.
Fair enough. Satoshi didn't say specifically that the Bitcoin should be fast and cheap. But let's have a look at the title. What does it say? Does it say Electronic gold? Electronic safe? Electronic value storage? No. It says "Electronic Cash". You know, that stuff in your wallet used as common means of exchange?
Trust-less-ness and anonymity is now fulfilled by almost any shitcoin out there. But on top of that, they can actually be efficiently used for payment. What else does Bitcoin have except for the reputation gained by being first?
This "store of value" meme is argument of people who don't care transaction fees can reach insane levels, because they bought it as investment and to speculate. But it won't be worth anything, if you can't use it to pay for things. Gold is store of value too, but you can actually easily transfer golden coins, if you choose to do so. Without insane fees. We've been doing that for centuries.
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:06:00
I'm not saying you should be petty, [but it sure feels good to be petty](
If they are blocking your credit purchases, fair enough. I can see their point, since it is them who guarantee the payment.
If they are blocking your debit purchases, move. And let them know why.
Also, it may be worth notifying any form of financial control agency you have in your country. They may be interested.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:49:54

Yep, you are absolutely right. Fiat currency is as worthless as Bitcoin. It is only worth what other people are willing to give you for it. Just as Bitcoin.
But do you know what makes Bitcoin different from fiat? People trust fiat.
