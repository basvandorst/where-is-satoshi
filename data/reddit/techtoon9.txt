I agree your are not even investing you are throwing your money down the toilet.  
Money is just fiat for actual work we do. The work is the important part not the fiat. You guys who think what fiat used matters are so naieve.   Btc will fail you’ll lose your money and have accomplished nothig other than looking naieve.  This isn’t some ‘message’ to ‘the man’, they don’t give a shit about such a small amount of money. Nobody does.  
99% of all crypto’s are a flat-out scams, and the few that arnt will never work as a currency (especially btc) you could make some money off the backs of other investors, (again forcyou to make money someone else loses) but your way better putting it into amazon or Microsoft.   And no your not sending a message to anyone. Fiat is fiat regardless of if it’s a peso or a gold brick or a dollar, and yes they can all be manipulated including crypto’s.

Dude all of bitcoin combined does not equal one single Wall Street hedge fund. It’s a fart and this is demonstrable. Why you are trying to argue against a fact is silly.  Buffet said it best a year ago when he said, it’s going to end in tears. You guys are nuts.  Also why are you typing like a 8 year old child?

there is no intrinsic value.  
When say a stock falls once it nears it’s worth maybe you’ll  buy. Even if they liquidate you are prob ok.  But these imaginary currencies that are just electrons in ram have no value anymore than one of those starter pretend trading accounts.  as everyone’s waiting to hit bottom it will eventually be worthless this is why you see a linear steady fall for 12 months.  Nothing ever goes literally to zero no, but anyone with bitcoin should sell this second. Every minuite they way they are just going to lose more.

Sure dude I can also make money in Vegas, that doesebt mean it’s a sound investment. You know how a investment scam works? Early guys make tons and the rest all lose to fill the gap. Money has to come from somewhere since unlike a stock btc has no actual values it can’t make money only transfer.  How you guys seem to think you’ll all get rich is a basic math error. For every dollar you make someone else loses. This is simply the way it works. 
Also it’s not an innovation any more than the buzz word cloud is.  If it really was meant to innovate the author would have stuck around, not made millions and fucked off.  You know who does that? A guy running a scam.

That’s not how logic works. Investments are simply future bets. Past is not in the equation (Enron did great in the past).  Bitcoin has no future, without any intrinsic value and the initial scam finished All it will do is slowly die.  This is what all the real investors said a year ago and it’s exactly what it’s doing. I do genuinely feel sorry for some.  My mom is deceased, she would be 100+

None of you say why though. You only say all the reasons you don’t. Realistically most people are in crypto to make money. And if your not they what’s the point? The reason you don’t say I’d because it’s probably the former and you just don’t like admitting it to yourself. 
Fear? Oh fuck give me a break. How many other ways are you gonna show you’re a disenfranchised 99%’er?
I own one business and just starting up a second, I have lots of money but don’t really spending much anyways, I’m not sure what fear you think I have? Currencies don’t mean anything thr work I do every day does.  Currencies are just escrow

God you sound naieve. 
Work hard in life, that’s what matters. All currencies are jusy a go between, it doesebt matter which one you pick. But pick a real one. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:37:59
Hah oh god so blind, the rest of the 99.9% of investors (who arnt in crypto) I would say laugh but it’s more just sad.

I don’t think you understand what that word intrinsic means. By definition it has no intrinsic value. As for it’s *value* that is currently three and some grand if you are in the USA.

This only works for things with intrinsic value, ie pick up MSFT or NFLX when they are down. Crpytos will drop till they are worth nothing, there's no other possible outcome because there's nothing to catch the fall, everyone will wait till it hits bottom to buy in (why would you do anythign else?) but no intrinsic value (don't argue this is a fact) means no bottom.
this is what is happening all year and will continue, talk to any relatively smart investor and he would have told you this a year ago and will still tell you this.

Erm ok there man, use whatever moon-language your head desires. The rest of us on this planet agreed on what words mean a long time ago, it helps us communicate and is probably what your having such a hard time.

 too small. All btc combined wouldn’t  even buy half of Apple, heck it is less than Apple made this year.  There’s lots of hedge fund managers on Wall Street that would be bankrupt if they work up and had there accounts replaced by all the btc in the world. And that’s just a single hedge,  there are thousands of those. The government doesebt care abour btc anymore than it cares about their lunch budget 
.  I just don’t get why you guys don’t understand this. It doesn’t work as an investment, it doesn’t work as a currency and it doesn’t send a message to anyone. It just makes you lose your money unless you got in early (as with all pyramid scams).

When are you guys going to understand it was a scam?
All of Bitcoin doesn’t even equal a single Wall Street hedge fund. It’s so frustrating to watch.  Invest in Netflix and Microsoft not some Japanese guys pet project from a decade ago.

Holy shit dude, do you have Down syndrome? No I’m demonstrably correct by a simple google search, but you are apparently to lazy or to retarded to do that. Welcome to the block list.

**HOLY SHIT** you are *major* fucked up.
