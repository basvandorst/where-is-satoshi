that's the second comment I've received equating crypto purchases to casino gambling. Sure, they both can inflict major losses, but you're the one that decides when to sell. I sat on LTC for 3 years because I refused to take a loss. And I didn't. If you think buying crpyto is like a card game than I advice you to sell now and forget about crypto because clearly you aren't a believer of the tech or the long term of it.

Dude. If you’re going to say something as stupid and obvious as that... maybe you shouldn’t be playing with money.
I have less than 10% of my savings in crypto because I understand fiscal responsibility. I don’t think people in this sub crying about the prices have any idea what those words mean when together.
The older I get the more I believe in mass sterilization. Dumb people have far surpassed those that hold intelligence in breeding.  I mean, millions of people were actually stupid enough to vote for Trump. Millions of poor people identify as Republican and vote against their interests because they believe they’re temporarily embarrassed millionaires. It’s insane.

lol.. I did a nice dab of clementine from weed.rar / kanna king farms and I'm calm now. Tastes like orange juice and makes everything more tolerable. :)

Only, when the price drops they won't buy because "bitcoin is too volatile" for their taste.

don't just hodl, buy. that's the only way to average out your losses and have higher potential gains (and losses).
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:22:44
Not much you can do. Dumb people will always be dumb. Best case, they hang around someone smart and copy their moves, but even that is a sign of greater intelligence that a lot of people don't have. 
"natural selection"
I know this comment won't be well received because.... emotions.
For the record, I'm not saying buying and taking a loss makes you dumb. Spending more than you can afford to lose is how to unlock that achievement.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:06:22
I'm proud of you. Congratulations on your efforts and the achievements that you've unlocked in this struggle we call life. 
This is what people need to hear this time of year and in this sub right now. I didn't read you comment as a rant, not did I think you were bragging.

Let me just stop you right there. My mom was on welfare and now she’s not. After the divorce she had to go back to school and make something of herself. Not everyone takes unforgivingly. I still remember that welfare Christmas football...

I thought this was funny the first time I saw it. With the Bitcoin annotation, it’s much funnier. I laugh aloud every time.

Y'all sound like ungrateful little bitches. Coinbase is THE place for newcomers to acquire coin. Do you have any idea how much the BTC community has been boosted by Coinbase? You're just making things more upsetting for newcomers. I mean, shit.... Even my 70 y/o mother has BTC LTC &amp; ETH because of Coinbase. It wouldn't have happened without them. Send nubs to Gemini and they have a higher chance of giving up on BTC. People have no loyalty these days...
Edit: You complainers make me fucking sick. I'm fed up with you people. You people bite the hand that feeds. Fucking die in a fire.

Coinbase claims? Bitcoin.com’s owners? Roger Ver is really confusing this shit for people. Damn. You’re exactly the buyer that worries me.  All you want is profit and if you don’t get it now than you’re ready to turn your back on Crypto. You don’t believe or understand anything about the tech. If you believe in the tech than don’t worry about the price. The more people believe and are progressively positive about the tech than you can only go up from there.  
I remember when I first bought crypto in late 2013. I told everyone that it was the future and begged for people to buy some because in the future it’s going to be like 10k a coin and you’ll be able to put your kids through college. People panic sold and drove the price down while others bought their panic and held it. Made me look like an ass and I stopped talking about it. When the price is all you talk about, it can really get in the way.

Hard truths are never popular, but I agree. I would also state that buying presents when you're not financially stable isn't smart. I googled average American's savings (assuming op is from the US). American's have less than $1k in their savings. Gifts have depreciating returns and don't put food on the table.

Upvoted for the lulz. This should be pinned.

I’m not selling. Just buy a few grand here and there as I’m motivated to. If I knew we’d be here by now than I would’ve bought all at once. Like I said, buying the dips evens the averages from all my different buy-ins. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:59:00
Yeah, for a second and all the buy orders filled it back into 15s and then back into 16s and finally 17s again. You couldn't have purchased a 14k BTC if you tried unless you were among the first to place that sell wall.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:11:10
I'm glad there was a dip. I had multiple staggered buy orders that all filled. Did it continue to drop after my buy? Yes. Did I go on reddit and cry about it? No, I bought more coin and evened my averages. When people cash out again in the morning to buy bcash, it'll dip again... and I'll probably pick up some more. 
Kids these days...

I'm pretty sure I wasn't supposed to be laughing my ass off at that video(?). [7]

I thought it was actually pretty amusing and didn't take any offense to it. Ellen is cool in my book...
