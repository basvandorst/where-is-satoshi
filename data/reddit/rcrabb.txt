My wife and I had a good laugh about it.

It made my wife laugh.  That's awesome enough for me.

Even if you're in it for the long haul, it seems like it's never a bad idea to cash out at least a small percentage of your investment when you see what could easily be a bubble.  Did you not at least sell one bitcoin today and make back your initial investment?
@_date: 2013-03-20 05:48:57
Yeah, as long as you can buy bitcoins with dollars, and dollars with bitcoins, there's not really any stopping it.

Just because you don't care for what someone else is posting doesn't mean they are merely posting it for karma.  They might genuinely feel creative from their simple work, and the people upvoting might be genuinely amused as well.

yeah, I have a gram of something stored in my closet since February that hasn't gained nearly as much value as the bitcoins I spent on it.

woohoo!  thank you!

No, luck is not a real thing.  But I'm trying to find something positive about losing a good chunk of money (not more than we can afford to lose).  And I personally find it amusing that I publicly stated that the bitcoin market would tank because I was investing in bitcoins (and it made it to front page of r/bitcoin) and indeed literally minutes after my order went through the floor dropped.

as an update, my order finally got through this morning when the price was at $259.  So, like, I nailed it.

well I made the cash deposit on Monday, was finally credited this morning and immediately bought my bitcoins.  Since my purchase, price went from $259 to $225, so it is indeed looking like my luck was able to find that peak in the market.

Sure, but on the other hand she makes six figures and I'm a stay-at-home husband.  So it works out.

research != advice

Okay, so I was exaggerating a little for effect.  Though I do perform the majority of housework, I'm also a full-time grad student.  My turn will come, eventually, to be the earner.  But it's really nice to be taken care of :)

yep, I agree.  I had started the process of buying when I posted that, and the transaction finally happened when the price hit $260, so I consider myself the Bad Luck Brian of bitcoin.

I am actually hoping that it will start to stabilize at reasonable price by the end of the week (even if it is much lower than what I paid) and it will inspire folks that it is not merely a bubble.  At which point it might steadily, if slowly, increase over the long term.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:40:08
oh I can't wait to tell her.
