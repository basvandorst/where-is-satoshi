From what I read, these contracts are for a cash settlement at a future date equal to the price of BTC on the daily Gemini auction price not their order book.
For example I might sell you a futures contract for expiration on 4/1/18 for $18,000 and agree deliver to you the USD equal to BTC price on that date.  The seller is on the hook for coming up with the cash on that date to settle the contract.
I'm not sure how they will influence the market since they are not actually going to impact the order book on the exchange and actually don't deliver BTC to the buyer.

If all your trades were short term (&lt;1yr) and you end the year all in cash that would work.  You are only taxed on realized gains, so appreciation since your last trade isn't taxed.

Most of Europe is ready to go cashless, India is actively trying to get rid of cash.  Venezuela just announced they were rolling out a state cryptocurrency "Petro".  I could see a path, it's not certain by any means.  I'm more confident that if it happened it won't be BTC though.

I think whatever option you choose, there is a risk of a backdoor in the thing that broadcasts your transaction to the network.  If you used two devices and electrum, you have the risk of a backdoor into electrum.  This would be a single point of failure too.  At least with 2 devices the most risk your exposed to is 50% of your portfolio.
It would be a pretty bad day if everyone's ledger or trezor was compromised and funds were stolen.

I don't think it's legal to ship preloaded ones to the US.

Transfer times and fees, you'd need cash and BTC on both exchanges to make this happen.  It probably would take you a week to wire money from one exchange to another.

You need to track all exchanges to calculate your capital gains for end of year.  A couple sites that can help.

I think electrum supports this, I'm kinda risk adverse to multisig right now after the parity hack.  I think the risk of multisig going bad is higher then me losing my seed phrase.
What risk are you worried about that you need two different devices for multisig?

The contract USD settlement price is set by the Friday 4pm Gemini auction.  My understanding of the Gemini auction is somewhat decoupled from the general order book.  Limit orders can be entered into the auction that won't show up on the continuous order book.  I think anyone looking to dump BTC to suppress the price would target the auction and Gemini order book not the overall BTC market.  This would only make sense to me if they sold a ton of weekly futures at a high price.
Gemini does have controls in place to cancel the auction if it deviates by more then 5% from the midpoint of the continuous order book, so i haven't thought through completely how this could be implemented.  I might have to put in some low limit orders on Gemini Friday afternoon in case anything happens.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:47:44
The futures aren't actually for delivery of BTC though, they are settled for the cash price of BTC on Gemini exchange.  Buying/selling a future doesn't impact the order book on the exchange.

For that amount of money you should be storing it on a hardware wallet like a trezor or ledger nano s.  This is the only reasonable way to make sure your private key is virus proof.
Buy on GDAX as a maker for 0% fee and send directly to wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:31:07
The device has a pin and a recovery seed.  You store the recovery seed offsite in a safe location (think safety deposit box).  You can always recovery the device from the seed even if you have to buy a new device.  Your protected from device theft because the device wipes itself after 3 attempts to access with the wrong pin number.
You are right that if anyone gets your 24 word seed they can access and control all your accounts so you need a good secure location for your offsite recovery sheet.
The advantage of the hardware wallet is it's virus proof, you can even use it on a infected computer and be safe, you always know where your funds are going and have total control over the private key.

Well Gemini is recently having a lot of maintenance.  But no, they have no deposit or withdrawal fees for either currency or crypto in either direction.  I've done a half dozen domestic ACH transfers and two wire transfers and they have gone smooth.  I used Ally Bank and Wells Fargo
Gemini doesn't have litecoin, and Eth is slow to transfer anywhere on the network due to cryptokitties.

Next time get a paper/hardware wallet so it doesn't happen again.

Sounds like you've invested more then you can lose if a 15% swing has you ready to sell.  Maybe you need to reduce your holdings so you don't panic sell if the market at some point drops 50%.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:28:04
The seller of the contract has an incentive to "short" the market.  Bitfinex allows margin trading.
The contracts will settle for the cash price of BTC on the Friday Gemini daily auction.  No BTC will actually be delivered at the expiration of the future.
But since the settlement price is on Gemini's auction the only way I think you could do this would be to bid up BTC before the contract was written and them dump BTC back on the market right as the contact was to expire to lower the settlement price.  If the futures market got quite a bit larger then the orderbook/aution this could be very lucrative even if you lost a lot of money trading the actual BTC.  Remember the derivatives market is huge, over 5 times the size of all stock, bonds, and bank deposits.

Buy your long term investments after bad news, black swan events:
* Stocks after Tech bubble/Housing collapse
* BTC after Mt Gox
* BTC after Silk Road
* BTC after Fork Scare
* BTC after China Ban
* Iota after hash function vulnerability
* Eth after DAO
Don't catch the falling knife, wait for a recovery.  You'll know your near the bottom when you think the price might actually go to zero.  The only 50% corrections i see risk of could be market manipulation through futures (shorting) or a collapse of Tether.

Knowing your nature is the most important thing, consider this a lesson, you need to make it hard for yourself to sell:
* Delete blockfolio
* Send your coins to a hardware wallet so you can't quickly sell them quickly.
* Store your hardware wallet offsite like a bank deposit box
I don't know a way with BTC yet but with Eth another option is invest in something like a ether hodl contract where you don't have access to your funds for years.

Gemini uses Silvergate Bank in California, wire transfer was done domestically same day and funds available.  ACH works great for Gemini, just a $500/day limit, they will pre-fund your account up to $500/day while the ACH routes.  No fees from Gemini for either.

Not if it's randomly generated inside the device.  You could also make up your own random BIP39 seed and use it with the device if you don't trust the generator in the key.
For the ledger, the TRNG true random number generator which generates the seed is inside the the device’s Secure Element (ST31).   so they would have had to get another company to build them a backdoor into the secure element to influence the random generator.
Here was a hardware breakdown and attack vulnerabilities:  the MIM attack vector on the ledger was closed in a recent firmware upgrade.
In the end the [sock drawer attack]( is their biggest weakness

Bitcoin doesn't pay interest, that's the point, it's deflationary.

Gemini Exchange with Wells Fargo also has not given me any problems with ACH or wire transfers.  They still have some uptime/maintenance issues though.

You owe capital gains on every trade, reinvesting your profits doesn't matter.  At the end of the year you'll need to net up all your gains/losses.
One nice thing is with Crypto is it's so volatile you can tax loss harvest when the market is down to help defer gains are reduce taxes.
Even if you just hold it's likely the IRS expect you to pay capital gains on the market value of the BCH and BTG you've received.  You can consult your accountant but it would be reasonable and safe to assume a cost basis of the first day of trading.  This isn't like stock split and would be taxed like issued stock dividends.

Gemini is a FDIC insured financial institution, your fine.

Never is a long time
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:14:33
To my knowledge those two exchanges are the only two that offer FDIC insurance for cash held in accounts.  That was a big deal for me since they were willing to jump through the regulatory hoops to be compliant.

That's probably the miner's fee to process the transaction on the blockchain.  If it moved wallets on the blockchain the miners get paid.  The fee is independent of the size of the transaction so it's a larger % of small amounts.  The more congested the network gets the higher the fees to make sure your's goes through.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:09:48
I'd stay with GDAX and Gemini though, GDAX is cheaper if you trade with limit orders otherwise taker fees are the same.  They are both insured and cash is protected by FDIC up to $250k.  Stay away from any exchange with a USDT pair, tether is a ticking bomb

Leaving it on coinbase exposes you to counter party risk that it could be hacked and your currency taken.  USD on coinbase/GDAX is FDIC insured so that is protected.
In general if you don't own your private keys your relying on someone else to take care of it.  If you've got more then $1k and your investing and not trading you should look at getting a hardware wallet like a ledger/trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:44:18
Sorry, US dollars on either GDAX or Coinbase are fully insured by the FDIC, GDAX and Coinbase are the same company.  Leaving cryptocurrency on any exchange is probably not a great idea if you have a lot and plan to hold, not trade.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:22:43
Do you think a hot wallet is safer then leaving it on coinbase?  I feel if you put it on cold storage vault on coinbase it's probably only 3rd in security behind a properly stored/generated paper wallet and hardware wallet.

I watch the 1-day MFI (Money Flow Index), I'm looking to buy when it's under 20 since fear is high, and looking to sell when it's over 80 and greed is high.  The MFI got as high as 90 this week when prices hit 17000+, the highest since May, a correction was more likely in my mind then a continued run-up.
Even if your going to hold long term I think there will be better entry points in the future, I'm not guaranteeing they'll be a lower price then now but you will have future entry points where the upside is far more likely then downside risk.  After all this is supposed to be investing not gambling.

You should reevaluate whether this is really the right investment for you.  You will almost certainly see 50%+ draw downs in your account long term and if your not ready to hold on to your investment even if it is down 80% you should get out before you sell at the bottom.
