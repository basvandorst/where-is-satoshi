Hate Roger Ver, but we have to wait for Bcash to be available for sale on Coinbase before celebrating. Most casual buyers don't use GDAX.

Tell me why Bitcoin deserves to be the No. 1 crypto? 
It's only living on brand recognition and public ignorance at this point. 9 year old stagnant technology. Slow with high fees. 2018 will see it lose its dominance over the market whether you like it or not.

Sent a significant amount of bitcoin 4 days ago with a very small fee by accident, still unconfirmed. Anyone know of a legit bitcoin accelerator website?

Ledger Nano S, not sure if that's possible with this wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:02:07
It's not a scam?

Influence big miner companies and whales have over the market. BCH is worse though.

Accidentally sent 0.8 BTC from my Nano Ledger S wallet to an exchange with a fee of only 0.0001016 BTC. That was about 21 hours ago. How long will I be waiting for the transaction to be complete?

No luck, cant find any record of the transfer in the electrum wallet. :( Anyminer able to boost the transaction speed? Will tip in BTC.

How many here hold altcoins? Seems I'd be better off just using all my remaining BTC to buy more altcoins. That market is really thriving at the moment with more gains to be had.

How does "child pays for parent" work??? Would like my bitcoin back sooner than a few months.....
Will the transaction automatically be cancelled If no miner bothers processing it?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:33:31
Thanks, I'll try that.

He means wait for the general public to see BCH and start buying it.

Bitcoin is market leader by virtue of first mover advantage. Plenty of newer coins act better as a currency. Notice how I'm being downvoted by raging BTC fanboys (most who have only been in crypto for the last few months). Go to  to see what informed people think of bitcoin.

Most of BTC is owned by a handful of people.

Going to convert my remaining BTC to altcoins, just a waste of money having it stagnate whilst the altcoins are growing at rates BTC will never match.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:52:44
People have just realised that BTC is a shitcoin by modern standards. More profit and supeior technology to be found in altcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:38:49
Do bitcoin transaction accelerators websites work or are they scams?
Sent some Bitcoin from my Nano S with a very low fee by accident, it's been unconfirmed for 4 days now...
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:12:27
The correction happening right now
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:44:07
Have had the same problem
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:18:26
Have no sympathy for shitcoin shills like you to be honest. Had it coming for a longtime.

Those Wall Street bonuses just arrived and Chinese New Year is on the way. 
2019 is looking good.
Remember it's darkest before the Dawn.
