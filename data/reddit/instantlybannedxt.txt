exactly.  doesnt that seem counter intuitive to the decentralized nature of bitcoin?   I don't understand the debate, honestly, but censorship pisses down wind into the face of decentralization, it would seem.

But how can 2 guys get 900 nodes running in less than a week all on their own? I think they're forcing a discussion, and this subreddit is trying to suppress an uncensored discussion.    I have no agenda at all, except for transparency. That'd sure be swell.     Why not have an AMA in this subreddit with the guys running XT?   Wouldn't that give a clearer picture?

what would make a 'hard fork potentially hostile'?   who feels threatened?

I welcome both sides,  the developers who oppose the proposal are in charge of the largest bitcoin forums though, so thats why I'd be asking for the other sides point of view.   I'd just like to make the decision for myself. If I have an agenda, that's it.

how is that objective?  you're telling me not to consider something.   I like to consider all possibilities and take in all information, and not have those kinds of decisions made for me.   Running a full XT node is similar to voting right now, one could objectively say.  And while people are emotional, nothing has changed. If the block Size and Hard Fork Dialog is such an important one and we need to make decisions and disregard others, wouldn't it be objective to say that XT is illuminating in that respect.  Its forcing the discussion that needs to happen.

It was after the crash, wasn't it?  Is he on there now?

I don't think its hard.  I am really just trying to shine some light on my doubts, but all I get is a narrative from most people.   Can't we just be slightly more objective.

Are you saying, you'd consider bitcoin to be not 'easily manipulated'?  How is that objective? lol
