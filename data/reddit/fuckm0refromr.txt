How the fuck do they know where your *bitcoin address* is from?

China's example is one of the most viable attack vectors on crypto-currency. When governments and ISP's control internet access, you're only accessing it at their whim. 
Especially when it comes to capital controls, if they deem it necessary, it's lights out.

The cattle is getting loose, time to reign them in.

They FUND and by extension OWN the gov't &amp; the banks. It's a really effective system. For them anyway.

This is as devious as it is crafty. 
1. Take deposits
2. Halt withdraws without notice
3. Keep all funds that don't pass AML screening

Except all the users that can't get their transactions into the current chain.
Though by that point they'll be so frustrated they'll probably go with one of the alts while they're at it.
Hope I'm wrong =/

I blink, and this is what I get?

They done a good job shutting the *rest* of the country down...

Definitely one of the best exit strategies. Taking some profits off the table to put you and yours years ahead financially.
No doubt the absolution of stress will improve your lives both in quality and longevity. May Satoshi be with you =)

Users pay these fees because they have BTC and can't move them otherwise, so not a "gun to their head" but a "pay up, or you can't use your money".
And the all time high was ~10% above the peak from 3 YEARS ago. Look at the highs the alts are hitting (except LTC, it's just flopping around right now).
It's clear where all the users are going...

Kind of like the wall-mart effect? Take a loss in the short term to starve the competition, then squeeze the market when you have a monopoly?
Thinking out loud, this "fee squeeze" will probably cause another flight of users to the alt cryptos.

Thanks for the link! A discussion from before everyone's hair caught fire, will give that one a read.

It was, before there was any real competition in alts. Now it's too similar to bitcoin, and all the reasons to prefer LTC over BTC are available in other alts with even more favorable features.

This is the next, and arguably more convoluted step. Marrying the wild west of crypto-currencies with the ultra strict fiat regulations.
Whoever manages that is going to be the next paypal, and potentially even bigger.
Though some argue that doing so negates the very purpose of a decentralized currency.

Yeah, have you seen ETH's performance this year? Call them what you will, but the result's been unbefuckinglievable.
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:36:21
Which has been the most disappointing "top 10" alt of the year =/
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:24:17
Me and my mates still use LTC between us. Way faster, and up until recently was way more stable around $4. Made life easier, when everything was in $4 fractions. 
Now it's bounced to $40, and we're dealing in decimals again. Fuckn crypto XD
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:34:14


What do you suggest to do after you've done listening and have been waiting over a year for changes to be implemented?
In the end, the market will decide. And after doing nothing and watching bitcoin's dominance dwindle, I think we all know which direction is most prosperous. Though by now it might be too little too late.
LONG LIVE THE ALTS!
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:19:37
You've completely underestimated the price difference there, but I see what you're saying B)

IF they come back. Even then most people will consider themselves lucky they got anything back at all.
IF they come back AND credit all the BTC holders with the forked/split tokens, I'll eat my hat and take back everything I ever said about those sneaky ruskies.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:10:15


They timed this to profit off the fork. Look what they did with their customers' ETC after the ETH split...
