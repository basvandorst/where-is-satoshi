The problem is that when it's not a scam, it's amateur hour with the typical bitcoin business CEO.  They don't need any sort of history or proper business plan to get capital from a bitcoin IPO, people just toss their coins out there like it's nothing then wonder what went wrong.  On the other hand, a VC will fund your bitcoin endeavor if you have a product/service that will make money and a proper business plan.  Part of that includes knowing how much money you need to get going and knowing how long you can run with literally zero revenue after startup costs.  But the average person buying into a bitcoin IPO doesn't care about that.

Tons do which isn't much of a red flag.  I made the risky investment.  Literally the only reason I'm still holding it is because I've completely written off my investment as lost and a very long term investment.  I might invest a tiny bit more if it drops below 0.0005 but I'm yet to determine how much.
eASIC has stated they do have some sort of dealings with AMC but are apparently under an NDA.
People also brought up the corporation registration being in Delaware which means nothing.  Delaware is a tax haven for corporations and you'll see plenty of multi-national corporations registering in Delaware for their USA dealings but headquartering elsewhere just like VMC.

Anywhere between 6 months and the end of the world.
At this point since BFL hasn't even managed to actively clear any of their backlog except for a small percentage of Jalapenos, it's going to take BitFury and KNC having in-stock units ready to ship.
And who really knows what the actual network hashrate will be when the dust settles after all the August-October timelines for shipping hits.  No one knows which of the manufacturers will be actually shipping and which will be able to actually clear their backlogs.  Then we'll see the price drop again and the clear winner will be the person who can undercut the lowest price per GH/s while still maintaining profit.

After a sellof?  It was in the middle of the sell-off.  It's just going to make things twice as worse waiting that long into the sell-off and not letting it recover.  I wouldn't doubt it if it dips low enough to make LTC back to under 50 cents (BTC US$25) when all the markets come back up.  Everyone's going to be waiting for the up-time, they are going to get DDoS'd again and their servers still won't be able to handle it and then the panic sell goes well below the BTC-e low today.

There really won't be a flood of new bitcoins, it's just being funneled into less hands.  The only thing you can be certain is that price will go up significantly and down significantly.  Not necessarily in that order.
Honestly, the worst thing for BTC price was that sudden lull in wild fluctuation followed by Gox suspending withdraws.  It built up pressure of miners (and silk road dealers, and some legit people) needing to get their money out to pay electricity bills, re-up and just easily cash out in general.  I typically use CampBX so I would have been unaffected if I wasn't waiting for a higher price.
I'm personally looking to open a mining bond operation in the beginning of next year while waiting ASIC manufacturers to release their chips, drop prices and have a steady stock.  I see the hashrate falling anywhere between 1-2 petahash by November and refuse to let investors get burnt before we even get started.

You actually make more money merged mining bitcoin plus all the MM coins than LTC mining now.

Anything you mine now is just going to be speculation on if an altcoin is going to get a better rate when/if BFL starts shipping significant quantities of units.  If you're going to just mine and immediately sell, it doesn't matter what you mine since all the major coins are very close in price per day at this point.

They know better with the impending shipment of ~284 TH/s of Avalon chips starting in the next week or so.  Their liquidity is next to nothing and they would just be hemorrhaging money when the difficulty triples to 60M in the next month as units are assembled and then another ~20M difficulty jump in September when KNC ships.  That's not even mentioning what ASICMINER deploys or sells during that time.  They know damned well they aren't going to be shipping any significant number of units before their units are unprofitable.

Only way that the price will decrease at this point is if one of the auctions fails to sell all 50 blades at a time.  Which in turn will only happen if a competitor emerges and can actually meet demand.  The demand will shortly be lowered by the companies emerging to use Avalon chips but even those will be limited since you need about US$100,000 to get started between your first set of chips, the boards, a few reflow skillet/oven, and staff to put them together and not totally fuck them up.  So ultimately, spending 50BTC per unit is your only real option.
But it's not that bad of an option.  US$5650 for 10GHash.  Whereas you spend $4800 for just the video cards for 10GHash.  (Assume average 625Ghash per 7950 with some of them being shitty overclockers.)  That only leaves you $212.5 for each set of main computer components, which is a very low budget.  It's actually not a bad deal for being an early adopter considering most of them are coming in at around 12Ghash..

So this makes 11 units, of what was originally a $150 price point?  Congrats on shipping $1650 of product, which they probably had several times this amount of orders come in over the weekend.

I feel [coinchoose]( is a better website.  
But I agree alt coins are dead for the moment because there are far too many of them and no where near enough people buying them to keep the price afloat.  Take FRC for instance.  (Full disclosure: I dumped over 30k FRC a week ago before it really plummeted.)  The current price according to coinchoose is 0.000171 but there's only 585 coins wanting to be bought at that price.  I'm a relatively slow miner and I make that in less than 12 hours.  Compounded with the fact that it's also an SHA-256 coin, there's going to be ASICs jumping on it once it breaks 120% profitability.  That price is going to quickly fall to 0.00015, eat a small portion of the 40K wall, that wall along with the 50K wall at 0.00014 will be removed (I've been watching FRC closely because of my stake in it) like it always has.
Those big orders are all the same person now that I've stepped out of buying up FRC (I was basically matching what he was putting in at any given time) which in reality only leaves a grand total of 4291 FRC down to 0.0001025.  That's only going to be roughly 17.5GHash for 24 hours at the difficulty that will cause 120% profitability.  The hash spike on FRC is typically 250-350GHash and those profitability jumping coins are typically sold by the end of the day.  That's going to leave roughly 60K FRC sold in a day once that profitability spikes.  There's only 27491 FRC down to 0.00005241 if you subtract that wall.
TL;DR:  The value of any given altcoin can disappear over the course of a few hours and the actual profitability is very deceptive.

There's no hardware being sold with the USB miners so high in price compared to K16's and blades on hold.
  You also have to realize that even 0.0181/share is still insanely high dividends compared to what you should be seeing but everyone in BTC is looking for get quick rich schemes so you're going to see the price drop until the new blade price is announced and sales pick back up.

Yep.  I put a little bit of money into it and considered it scammed away the instant I invested at the slight chance it wasn't.  Usually people say "don't invest more than you're willing to lose" but the AMC security should be "don't invest anything you're not willing to give away".  I've donated more BTC (and other coins) away than I've invested in AMC so I'm not upset.
In reality, the only way to save the security is for him to become completely transparent in *everything*.  I saw him mention at one point that he's worried about competitors getting an edge on him.  Unless he downright gives away the manufacturing process, there's not much for him to worry about.  So I'm labeling it 100% scam even though I am invested in the security.  
I'll be waiting to see if it drops below 0.0001 and throwing another BTC at it just in the slim chance it's not a scam and a paranoid idiot is actually leading the company and is able to salvage it.

I see the price being ~5 BTC each to be aggressive against the K64 and ultra aggressive against the K16.

I like how people are comparing Avalon doing this to ASICMINER.  There's two massive differences between Avalon and ASICMINER.  
The bigger difference is that Friedcat is completely transparent in what he's doing with his hardware at any given time.  He is tight on the business side because you have to be to stay ahead of the competition, especially when the competition is finally getting ready to ship in the next month or so.
The more important difference is that ASICMINER sends out purchased blades immediately but continues to expand their own mining operation with their own profit.  Friedcat is doing what's best for the shareholders by bringing in massive bitcoin income on two fronts instead of just selling hardware or just expanding his mining operation.
I'm not a shareholder but I'm just waiting to see what moves Friedcat makes after Avalon chips are proven to ship at ~8BTC per K64 to purchase ASICMINER hardware either with the impending price drop or gen2 chips and will eventually purchase some of his units when I feel the time is right.

They are currently holding an auction for their first run of 10 ASIC blade units.  (32 chips x 300hmash = 9.6 ghash.)  They are currently in the hands of the foundation and will ship immediately upon closing of the auction.  They also have single chip units being manufactured as we speak.  They are going to continue to release units at a steady rate so they can expand their own farm without cost to investors.  Plus they need to do that because their farm is getting so big that it would give BTCGuild operators access to the 51% vulnerability in the next couple months and some credibility to BTC will be lost.  I'm sure dividends will increase significantly once the unit auctions are paying for all the units to be manufactured.
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:10:29
Depends on the machine.  I'm pulling in ~3Ghash (0.168BTC/day) from 5x7950.  ($1500 for cards plus ~$500 for a machine.)
The [ModMiner]( ones do about 840Mhash (0.0471BTC/day) for $1060 investment.
The difference is that the MMQ FPGA runs on only 40 watts whereas each of my 7950's run on about 180 watts each.  It would take you about 23 weeks to break even with my system IF the price follows the difficulty. (TL;DR: If the price crashes and doesn't bounce back, you're fucked and it will take a long time to reach return on investment.)  It will take 36 weeks to break even on an MMQ FPGA.  But pass that break-even point and you're pulling in more profit with MMQ's because of how pricey it is to run 7950's 24/7.
The other difference is current FPGA and ASIC units can only mine SHA256 coins whereas with a GPU you can switch to an scrypt coin when they are more profitable.

I only did calculations based on know Avalon orders and backed off. If BFL manages to ship, there's less than 5% DOA on the avalon chips, and Friedcat goes with a more competitive price, I could see a 10x increase on difficulty by the end of the year.
And just so everyone understands, those avalon chips are old technology and the contracted board assemblers will be able to pump them out quicker than they are being shipped in. Late July, early August will be insane and everyone is underestimating the coming increase.

He played it well doing limited auctions and then setting a flat rate for sales at the lowest auction price as soon as they saw how cheap the Avalon resellers are going to make their units.  The funny thing is they are still going to be able to sell units at 5x mark-up and undercut the Avalon resellers..

I feel like the relatively stable price to be negative for the short term price for cryptocurrency.  People are buying in now and then realizing the blast-off returns are gone while the "daytraders"/pump-n-dumpers are cleaning the floor with them.  I'm expecting the altcoins being added to mtgox is going to be the tipping point where everything goes to shit.  Gox obviously has the largest share of the market and the majority of traders will end up diversifying with their profits rather than new money.  Then the overall stability of all cryptos comes and then people start cashing out because there's no get quick rich scheme left.  All the miners that don't understand difficulty will also be leaving in a couple weeks when they realize there isn't going to be $50/week per 7950 as the difficulty is still racing after the influx of miners trying to get rich quick.  Then the long-haul miners will rule the cryptos again until the next bubble.

It's going to keep going for at least 2 months when Avalon chips end up on peoples' doorsteps and then you'll see a big dip in dividends and the I'm sure Friedcat has something up his sleeve for when that happens.  Maybe a magic trick.

And possibly even computer parts if they had intensity set high and a shitty power supply.  Mining is much more taxing on your system than gaming.
One of my friends recently started mining with 2-way crossfire and his PSU shit the bed because it was an off-brand PSU and was overheating.  I had warned him about it months ago when he asked me about my computers and was asking why I bought such expensive parts with no real performance benefit.  He's waiting for his new PSU to see if any hardware went with it.  He's just one of the classic examples of why you need to pick a quality PSU.
I can run 4-way crossfire on my gaming machine day in and day out if I'm just gaming.  Not 2 minutes after starting up it up, my top 7950 would be over 85 degrees and eventually power down from overheating.  I've done it just to see how many cards I can reliably mine in there.  The answer is 2.

Never.  You're better off holding onto that single BTC (or selling it) and seeing what happens after the ASIC game has settled down.
Current hashrate is 141,319.88Ghash.
BFL is slowly shipping at a snail's pace and will (very slim chance to) amp up production.
According to [Avalon's chip address]( they have sold ~284THash.
KNCMiner who will supposedly begin shipping in September.  They have somewhere between 155-311 THash dropping depending on how many Jupiters were ordered.
Even if BFL doesn't ship, you're looking at 580-736THash on the network.  Throw in a couple BFL and some remaining Avalon units for good measure and now we're talking about breaking passed 80M difficulty at an absolute minimum, if not 100M difficulty.  That's only about 0.055BTC/mo after September for 336MH/s.  That's not calculating in any other hashrate jumps like ASICMINER deploying their V2 chips into their mining operations or ANY of the units they sell.  Or any future sales of any of the ASIC companies which will obviously be coming once people determine who is actually able to produce units.
The only way that it will ever turn profitability is if a good chunk of Avalon chips are DOA, BFL decides to run with their money, KNCMiner turns out to be a scam, AND Friedcat falls off the face of the Earth while there isn't a replacement for him.

Back when ASICMINER wasn't even mining yet, they were very open with the cost of manufacturing the blades.  IIRC, it was something like US$10,000 to manufacture 100 units.  They will have quite a bit of wiggle room even if Friedcat decides to drop down to something like 10BTC a unit.

The "we're shipping in two weeks" attitude is what has been causing problems.

83 watts per blade on stock clocks and voltages (10GH/s) at US average of $0.12/kWh brings it to $0.24/24hr, $7.17/month, or $21.51/90 days.
If they are still able to be overclocked with the new boards to 12.829GH/s will bring them to 120W.  Using the same calculation the price to run them is $0.35/day, $10.37/month, or $31.10/90 days.
With such a low energy consumption, there is still about a 25% increase in overall revenue while overclocking.

Just to add:
They are using an EV certificate already.  It's through Digicert so new certs beyond the initial domain (or if they have multi-domain and break their 3 limit) are only $95/year after $295/yr for the first domain.  The cert for staging.mtgox.com is a StartCom class-2 cert which requires:
 &gt; 1. Registration documents of your organization (Tax office, Ministry of Commerce, Handelsregisterauszug etc.) or  
2. Excerpts of your latest tax declaration and  
3. Confirmation about the owners/shareholders, directors or CEO and  
4. Authorization to request certificates in the name of the organization signed by the director or CEO.
StartCom class-2 certs are $60/2yrs.  I would assume they are moving to StartCom once their DigiCert certification ends because of price.  I just moved all my company's certs to another CA so I'm used to the questions.  It does and will happen but most people just ignore it.

I'm thinking John Titor was lying about his time traveling.  He came back in time to get the IBM 5100 to mine the most profitable coin in 2038 that only mines on IBM 5100's.

Have you seen the hashrate for BTC this week?  35% difficulty increase this week just from ASICMINER shipments and them expanding their farm.  Plus you have the end of altcoins from the severe oversaturation of how many different altcoins there so you are going to get a lot of GPU minters jumping back on BTC because they are realizing they are losing money from jumping between different PPLNS pools.
I wouldn't be surprised if there isn't a doubling of difficulty before Avalon chips are even sent out if you include the retarget in the next couple days.  Plus another doubling on top of that in August once Avalon is steadily shipping and Friedcat gets more aggressive with pricing.
That ASIC cash cow is going to dry up fast.  If you don't have an ASIC unit now, you're just going to be buying one to keep up with your current earnings.  That is, unless the price doesn't bubble again.
Since I wasn't an early adopter, I'm just waiting for the real pricing competition to start and maybe consider ponying up more to early adopt the next generation of ASICMINER ASICs.
