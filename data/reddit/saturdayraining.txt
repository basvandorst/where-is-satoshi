are you guys cool now? you exchanged imaginary internet points for real money. Can you chill?
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:25:17
but if there is a network to broadcast to, why cant that network be used to say "message recieved"
isnt the network a reliable messenger then? doesnt that change the scenario from having an unreliable messenger?
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:44:33
how is that closed source? Its open source AND open hardware. looks pretty good to me.
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:34:33
perfect! thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:56:49
yeah, thats the main problem with the two generals communicating- how does the blockchain solve it?
@_date: 2016-11-14 04:23:19
oh man, if a trump presidency does crash the US dollar.....what bittersweet news it will be to my bank account...mostly sweet though

yeah, we dont make enough money.... we scrape by, and rent out the house we live in on the weekends, and go camping to make it all work out. Its not a huge deal, the trade offs are wonderful, but it does mean we dont get luxuries like residency. But we now do make enough to get some cheese every once in a while...which is enough for me :) Seriously though, residency costs I think 7 grand last time i checked it out- its not hard to do, just impossibly expensive. It only costs me around 200 dollars to go to costa rica and come back, all expenses included (if i go camping the whole time)
LIke I said, we also do a lot of work with an amazing conservation group- its exactly the kind of work we have always wanted t be doing. Lots of adventure and we have discovered many new species and saved many thousands of acres of old growth. Im hoping to actually get paid eventually, as is my girlfriend :/ but until then, the trade off is acceptable.
Even starting a company costs over a thousand dollars- an impossible amount for us to have any security left over. And if your security fails out here, you are screwed. We dont even have a car- which is soudning crazier and crazier after 3 years, considering we live over 2 hours from a supermarket
@_date: 2016-09-17 14:56:52
yes, we do have an NGO! it is panamanian though...which country are you in? I can contatc a freinds NGO there to accept the donation on our behalf, and pass it along!
Thank you by the way!
@_date: 2016-09-24 14:56:10
What damage do you think their doing?
@_date: 2016-09-16 22:42:54
theres a bitcoin QR code on the home page, and one on the donation page!
 Thats   thank you so much, we really appreciate it!
heres the imgur link
@_date: 2016-09-16 17:52:47
Thats actually an excellent fucking idea, since i live in the middle of the jungle. Ill make a post about this!
@_date: 2016-09-16 23:13:24
Thank you so much!
I am definitely looking into the right ways to store our money now.....This experience was bad, but honestly not as bad as my experiences with paypal and banks
@_date: 2016-09-16 17:35:30
not just back it up- I did back it up. I should have backed it up in different ways, too, is the point. Its not as simple as just having a backup.
@_date: 2016-09-16 16:20:42
whats this ledger thing? is it worth the 20 bucks?
great advice, BTW! Ill have to learn more about finding someone to manage spend tranactions. we do have ok cell signal, so it would work
@_date: 2016-09-17 01:01:49
didnt have any. Just a wallet dat file which was backed up
@_date: 2016-09-17 00:59:19
You would think so. But you know what they say, "idle hands spend time at the genitals" 
@_date: 2016-09-17 16:30:54
i mean, its a necessity. I cant just carry cash on me all the time. There arent ATMS for more than a hundred miles, and i dont have a car. Its about risk managment
@_date: 2016-09-16 18:29:35
oof, its for android bitcoin wallet, it doesnt really have a site to work with it as i remember. IIt was just called "Bitcoin wallet", and it worked pretty well
@_date: 2016-09-16 16:13:21
several, maybe a few grand USD...most of our savings were in there too :(
@_date: 2016-09-17 22:36:18
Good tip! Will do ��
@_date: 2016-09-17 00:35:59
i know i know, i just always imagined it as insurance against losing a device, or having it crash, or anything digital like that. I never really thought of my whole house being robbed, or it burning down.
Silly, i know, but ive never been robbed! 
@_date: 2016-09-16 22:44:24
Now thats a charity i can get behind.
Im actually thinking of pureeing a bunch of fresh fish, and dumping it all aorund the inside of his house while hes away....wonderful perfume in the tropical heat 3:)
@_date: 2016-09-16 17:36:41
Thank you stranger :) the puplets appreciate it!
@_date: 2016-09-17 05:42:20
not really. People rarely understand cash either ;)
and i just use a bitcoin debit card- i can still make/withdraw USD when i need to, right form my bitcoin. I just use bitcoin for all online purchases, and anything else i can get away with.
@_date: 2016-09-18 19:07:55
really appreciate it! you all have been so generous, i cant wait to show everybody whats being done with the money :)
Well be able to help all the dogs on the whole coast!
@_date: 2016-09-16 16:31:57
i would in the back of my closet.... sigh.... at least theres things i could do to back this up next time
@_date: 2016-09-17 00:27:38
That would be awesome.... if s/he started donating a lot to charities.... and maybe slow the witchunt on them.
Worth a shot. Anyway i can send them a message? :)
@_date: 2016-09-16 16:23:53
not the coinbase one, the other one.
I know, it would have been so easy to prevent! i just never imagined my security measures would fail like that. Ive learned a lot now.
Dont just back it up- Back up your backups in a way that if everything you own disapears, you can still access your funds
@_date: 2016-09-16 16:12:45
Yes! got it a new one...with the appropriate security measures ;)
@_date: 2016-09-16 18:25:46

@_date: 2016-09-17 23:16:12
we are on track to! It just costs money, and for a long time ADOPTA (the NGO) has been running on fumes. But the ADOPTA just got a nice donation, and we will probobly put some of it towards just that. 
I will contacta freind of mine, and let you know where to donate to!
Could you send me a PM with an approximate amount, so i can let him know?
@_date: 2016-09-16 22:54:19
Now your gettign it. I thought just backups were enough...nope. You need the right kinds of multiple backups
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:56:19
so why on earth would they ever need to to intergrate it to bitcoin? seems fine on its own.
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:42:40
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:54:31
Exactly.  Why bank everything on a new idea? people alays have hypothericals where they expect other cryptocurrencies to be on par or overtake bitcon, but when it actually happens, they just want to hold on to what they know.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:31:19
I think they are actually releasing it as a coin, though, or am i misunderstanding?
the original intent was to have it be part of the same blockchain- but I thought that changed? Dont they still have to mine it?
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:28:17
da fuck
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:46:54
ha, did someone take the money already?
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:48:48
just for now- if its accepted, it will grow large as well. it doesnt even need to be that big to work though
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:17:23
yeah, except they havent. Thats why they did this instead
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:07:42
if youve ogt the tech to accept one cryptocurrency, it really isnt that difficult to accept another- all the major exchanges of bitcoin can handle litecoin just as easily. Why would they not?
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:22:46
really wish someone would implement something like zerocoin.
But I do think the fact that miners can in on it is a nice selling point- its attractive to people who have lots of mining equipment in the same way it nice to own land. you can argue about whether that really matters, but the fact remains that many people rightly see it as more accessable to a common miner, and that might be enough difference to push it to fairly a high value.
@_date: 2013-08-01 08:38:26
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:32:01
Lite coin is winning too!
EDIT: geez, I didnt know you guys hated litecoin. What gives? i thought you were dwn for the cryptocurrency revolution? you didnt think thered be only one contender, huh?
