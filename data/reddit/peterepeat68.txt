Nice answer again but bitcoin is not a metal or a coin, it’s a virtual concept.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:23:07
Just go to your parents or cousin and ask for a line of credit against their house, I’m sure they will be pleased to help, but if it keeps going under $1500 by xmas you can get a part 9 agreement which allows you to pay off your debt at 50 cents in the dollar which avoids bankruptcy.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:34:03
No not a Govt shill just understand the global effect of the Elliot wave theory.
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:30:18
Cheers bro.. yeh.. I love bitcoin but I just couldn’t hold on and risk my kids happiness this xmas, just me others will be different 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:27:17
Just natural..just me.. cheers anyway 
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:54:21
Much appreciated, actually I’m just an old fella with my own concepts.. nothing unusual here.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:55:43
Cheers again not trolling just giving an honest opinion, if people don’t want that they can just ignore it anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:06:24
Yeh for me maybe 5 bucks or something but for the most part I’m out.. enjoy your profits! And have a great xmas!
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:10:33
Yeh as I have bipolar I’ve said this many times.
@_date: 2018-11-21 09:49:13
BTC now poised for 30k!
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:00:50
I know I will cheers bro
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:09:57
Maybe you should show a video on why bitcoin will go under $100?
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:00:19
Well I’d be in the same boat.. be nice
@_date: 2018-11-21 08:04:02
Yeh have these in my deals as well make heaps out of Coinbase and bitcoin on drugs as a drug dealer.. just awesome! Everyone should give it a go, so lucrative!
@_date: 2018-11-26 09:56:37
Not by a long shot
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:09:53
I would say so, last year he told me he can now pay off his house, and he still didn’t  sell..
I don’t get it at all, he is still holding.. weird.
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:21:05
Well, your in the right place and the right world.. stay there... it’s what dreams are made of.,,
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:29:56
Well there are many parents doing that at the local casino, maxing out 90k on credit card..it’s nothing new
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:47:13
No but I know markets have been trading for over 25 years and I follow Elliot wave cycles.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:36:35
I’m not sure it depends I guess if I was making losses for 5 years I’d call it quits it’s all about numbers I guess.
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:53:07
No it won’t, please stop these denial images.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:21:06
Cheers, yes I know it can be addictive for sure.. happy xmas coming up!
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:02:17
Agree but this time I was over my head so I had to dump it.. man.. I enjoy my sleep.. hope you do.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:24:29
Kumbaya.. oh lord kumbaya....
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:42:03
So a country means I’m insane ? Lol
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:02:27
“Hope” is a 4 letter word in the market place, denial is worse.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:56:38
Thanks enjoy xmas!
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:05:48
That’s just sheer greed
@_date: 2018-11-27 09:10:27
Not all old people are stupid, many have life experience as well, I think you underestimate the elderly that have seen life in its entirety.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:51:19
Well if I could see figures where I could pay off my house, I would have done it..
Maybe there is a mental attachment to the coin and some people just can’t let go?
Beats me.
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:44:16
You can spend a whole day talking about your personal losses, if you don’t understand cryptos, stay out, but don’t bag out something you have no idea or concept about.
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:00:36
Was going to buy a Harley, now it’s a postman’s bike.. eh oh well still has an engine.
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:44:28
Big dump signal
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:50:43
Buy the dip, then buy the next dip.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:39:45
Cheers. Will do enjoy
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:35:27
Cheers bro what ever enjoy bitcoin anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:26:29
It wasn’t me I said it will go under 1 k
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:36:33
Yeh in 5 years lol
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:32:55
Yes, but no matter how much education, it’s still all speculation, you may as well go to the casino, probably learn more there actually.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:53:49
Yeh right buy the next dip as it continues to dip further, a friend told me, never try to catch falling knives, he was right.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:18:44
Eh, no... the power of the mind to self delude, is unlimited.
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:07:27
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:57:56
My dads 82,and yeh he’s right Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme.. the older are generally wiser for sure.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:53:24
Well good luck to you captain.. hope things go well ! Keep some faith !
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:36:10
What ever enjoy your delusional thoughts regardless.
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:45:32
Oh ok
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:52:36
I agree, I never understood why they brought tether in in the first place, it never made sense at all.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:25:54
What ever, good luck anyway.. by the way there are many that know a lot more than I do so you will have to come after them as well. Lol
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:53:54
I bought at 20k I’ll hold even if it goes to $1
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:46:44
I hope that isn’t the bitcoin hole?
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:25:27
Ill wait till 99% off
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:03:07
Well I have a friend that bought in 2012 he never sold, so there is one example I can give 
That justifies my headline... who knows how many have done this?
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:05:50
Well my puppa knows any ways I might be onwy 5 but he does hehaheha
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:18:02
No exchanges have nothing to do with price movement they offer you to buy and sell, you the buyer and seller manipulate the price.. nothing to do with the exchange or anyone else
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:46:59
Yes it will be less profitable for sure, but you need to remember 2014 price when bitcoin was $5 if it goes back to that price the miners may just call it quits and start another hobby.
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:49:00
In 3 minutes you will reinstall all 3.
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:55:48
Well that’s living the dream I guess.. I have my hands completely full lol
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:53:07
And dropping...
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:07:46
Disclaimer, love the thumbs up for the joke, but I don’t touch drugs never will lol
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:18:15
Under 2k sound plausible
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:27:21
Man  I use bitcoin to buy crack, smack, dope and ice.. it’s the best!
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:57:42
Well that’s awesome nice to hear success stories which are so few.
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:56:49
Try 500
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:22:09
It’s in the article attached, not all are shutting down just quite a few that’s all
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:33:08
Well some people don’t live on much like me... I wanted the lambo dream but it looks like it ain’t gonna happen for me so I’m out but I still luv all of yas!
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:41:44
It’s probably a good wake up call anyway, we will see what happens with the mining domino death spiral that’s about to occur.
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:26:49
Note he goes down 5 different levels to $500, great TA!
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:09:41
Well may God bless you for that have a great xmas and enjoy your time
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:47:06
Man your into conspiracy theories I guess all cool.. lol
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:58:54
I remember there was a sale of a pizza
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:29:37
I doubt that very much.
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:57:48
Agree it’s a crock of shit
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:59:57
Well that just tells you, you shouldn’t be a hodler.. but each to there own
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:52:30
Should have bought tether instead.
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:35:44
I always thought the tether idea was pure evil and it is
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:54:38
Cheers, you too !
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:21:34
What if it keeps going under 1000?
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:28:51
Man that’s some serious purple heads you are smoken!
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:29:58
It will be China in the end.. like everything else.. they will take over America and the world sadly.
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:55:49
That’s incorrect entirely, Bill Gates loves bitcoin but doesn’t see a future in it long term.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:47:58
Well that’s all cool denial is a good thing helps us avoid issues
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:21:56
Same to you, even though I wish it was 2017, merry xmas to you, have a good one!
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:39:09
Yep all those cloud mining contracts sold as well. Slower transaction times, death spiral domino effect is about to happen.. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:40:15
All cool I may buy in again at 500 but I’d still be worried about that.. these times are very uncertain.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:58:39
Well go for it, if you don’t have any responsibilities that’s Aok !
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:06:40
Well I will, it’s kind of sad that we alll have to go though this fake stuff but I guess that’s life.. we live and learn..
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:24:57
 Well if it was 2017 I’d be in a better position, different times for sure
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:29:03
The worry for me about holding long term is many cryptos can get delisted,.. 
don’t like that idea either.
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:58:16
Cool, nice to hear some positive thought, with all the doom  and gloom.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:58:37
Well who knows? It’s just a theory
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:44:29
Well done bro.. don’t forget about your family and your friends that matter.. you never want to give that up..I won’t ever.
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:42:35
Haha, think I’ll take up smoking and drinking as well.. may as well go down hard.
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:59:37
So you think drugs will enhance our children’s future then? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:02:03
Your a good man, thanks bro
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:53:08
A true Hodler warrior.. hats off.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:33:57
May God bless you hope you make some money out of me.. enjoy your “profits”
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:25:15
what crap.. just let a crypto be a crypto.. everyone knows BTCs dynamics.. if it rises fast it drops even faster nothing unusual here.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:57:35
Sticking the finger up on the titanic, such poetry.
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:02:03
Nice can you sell it to me for 1/2? Lol
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:37:06
Lol is that English ?
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:42:16
That’s the exact price it will go back to, cheers!
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:09:34
I’m concerned as well, not sure whether bitcoin will actually hold at all.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:58:55
Just keep averaging down to $1 should make some money eventually 
@_date: 2018-11-21 08:01:38
With a name like wrinkled dog anus.. I’d say you may have some personal issues lol
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:06:39
Well as a parent I worry about my kids future, that’s all, and any parent can be absolute if they wish when it comes to bringing up their kids.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:06:23
 Nice one
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:01:01
If people bought tether in the first place they would be 100% up...lol
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:00:37
This would be great for shorting bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:27:37
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:45:42
You will be holding until your dead
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:33:42
Yes there are many people that borrowed against their house for a line of credit to buy crypto, it’s worth borrowing against your house and take the risk, doesn’t matter if you lose everything, you can always buy another house one day.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:40:42
A conspiracy theory lol
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:04:34
It’s funny why people will report others because they have read the international news?
And I’m not a troll just reading all the articles.. without bias.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:09:23
Yeh ride it if you can! Hope you get that 50%! But for now I’m out.. enjoy your “profits “
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:28:48
Yeh well so be it, at least I’ll have some money for xmas.. merry xmas by the way !
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:10:54
Well it was a pleasure, let’s all go down with the titanic, at least I feel proud hodling on to a lead sinker so we can all drown together.. oh the poetry... can’t wait to live on the streets!
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:26:40
Well good luck to you.. hope you pull it off.
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:54:54
Well you miss the true spirit then.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:27:46
Well don’t beat yourself up, you may be able to sell again in 5 years or so.. good on you for having patience 
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:27:35
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:47:36
So how can it enhance your children’s future then? Examples please.
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:41:26
It will be a spiritual experience when it goes to zero, we can all hold hands and meditate together in harmony.
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:33:48
Happy I havnt lost everything that’s enough
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:10:49
But the exchange can.
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:56:57
 Would you want to have a mortgage? That’s insane, if you can pay it off pay it off!
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:51:41
Well I certainly wouldn’t upgrade if I’m losing money by the second.. awful for sure, just feel sorry for all those guys that spent 12k on an s9 rig all for nothing.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:41:24
Some might wait 5 years hoping I’m sure
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:08:35
P.S English language corrections won’t keep the bitcoin price up, its we the people with bad English that won’t buy.
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:02:39
Sounds to me like world of lost hope.
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:15:26
Don’t worry ol fella he’s just waiting in line for his next ride.
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:55:29
So the red line has been crossed, domino death spiral begins?
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:32:22
Did you ever think to yourself that all cryptos are pump and dumps? It’s the way of the world in crypto.. remember we are not dealing in shares.
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:31:21
Yeh Coinbase is the best for my drug deals.. just love em.. so reliable.
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:03:29
Well my son has adhd, so prescribed drugs will be good for him
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:38:42
I beg to differ, tonnes of money went into mining, it’s a downward spiral effect, if miners lose we all lose.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:26:15
Coinbase just sent me a message, Bitcoin is below 5000..wow this is significant and I’m concerned now about how low it can go.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:32:59
$200 is possible again, no one knows the bottom sadly.
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:00:24
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:31:27
Yeh just didn’t like all the corrupt mining stories with BCH, doesn’t sound promising.
@_date: 2018-11-24 10:43:46
Way before 2140 there will be 100s of other leading coins or a completely different concept all together.
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:23:04
Like in Australia it’s up to the individual to keep accurate records at all times,
It’s important to lodge the gains otherwise it’s considered tax avoidance..
Again I only speak for Australia.
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:28:03
Nope never sell until it reaches 100k
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:14:27
Its not fud it’s just that prices have to go back to 2015 prices that’s all
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:58:19
Yeh but does that mean they should take ice and shit?
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:22:08
Well people have to forget about their selling levels, this is what causes resistance levels.. it’s proven that people tend to forget about their selling positions in around 2 to 3 years.. so you will have to wait that long before bitcoin reaches at least 7 k again
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:23:12
Your right I don’t know grammar therefore I’m wrong completely about my dad ! Wow
Man if only I had a genius like you to be around.. oooh yeh! 
Nah I’m right, period and so is my Dad.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:52:22
Well if you look at say bytecoin at .0005 cents it’s still being mined, just not a very profitable business that’s all... not sure why they do it using all that power for little return.
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:01:43
That’s a valid point, if drugs were free maybe there would be less addiction overall. It’s proven in many countries for sure.
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:04:49
The cash actually burns faster than that.. they need to speed it up.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:44:08
Well as older people we need to make sure our younger generation are not left in dire straits, I’ll make this my conviction for the future, will you?
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:07:25
Yes that’s correct.. he is still holding.
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:58:33
The domino BTC death spiral has begun due to mining shutting down and closing the doors, may BTC Rest In Peace sadly,
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:00:38
I don’t really get that mentality at all.. in the end fiat is what pays off your house.. 
maybe your already generations ahead of yourself, but for now live in the now today.
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:57:34
I think this time it’s going under $1000,hope I’m wrong
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:36:17
It takes time but one day you will get my concepts.
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:10:38
He was running a long a flat area at the end.. but I’m sure there is a hill somewhere in the next scene.
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:54:02
Well I have written a disclaimer, it’s a joke, wouldn’t touch it with a 10 foot pole, don’t like drugs period., but yeh I’m sure there are many that do.
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:54:39
I doubt that, just saying how it is to be honest and it’s in the news as well
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:22:21
Well how do illegal drugs enhance my children’s future, I have a friend who’s son is addicted to ice and his life is destroyed,  he has no job and drinks a case of beer a day..
How is that enhancing?
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:55:43
Well a game of 2 up isn’t far from it, care for a game? Lol
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:46:04
Well you must have an enormous portfolio, great.
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:31:33
Well if that makes you feel great about your life, go ahead may God bless you.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:41:56
Well if your the more fortunate many thanks for your contribution as well, may God bless you cheers :)
@_date: 2018-11-21 09:42:07
Holy crap I got so many thumbs up for a joke.. lol disclaimer. Never touched drugs never will.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:32:09
I wouldn’t recommend that, I would with shares but not crypto considering the current wave and mining losses.
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:05:02
Don t go down too fast with the new domino death spiral going down into oblivion, all miners are shutting doors and losing a tonne of money.
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:56:33
Well done! It’s awesome.
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:36:57
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:23:21
Well I believe everyone needs to work , but selling your kids? Hmm 
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:38:00
Great video, gold today is used in electronic components, and in space, Bitcoin is used in ???
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:44:48
I’m not really sure why, it’s just the articles I read about bitcoin that’s all.
@_date: 2018-11-24 10:52:26
Tangible things we hold in our hands are obviously a thing of the past today,
I wonder whether there will be a transition back to this concept over time?
Or will it be virtual from here on forever? Who knows?

And now we are In the new domino effect death spiral with all miners shutting down.. enjoy your xmas !
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:13:44
Well we all know many people also paid bucket loads of money for cloud mining contracts and now millions of these contracts are redundant completely, it’s a total con!
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:21:05
That’s a very true point, with Facebook and other social media, everyone is becoming more isolated, I think we may see a new revolution of parents turning off their phones and taking to their kids. I’d love to see this..for sure
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:49:58
Try lower alot of mining is shutting down, people that bought s9 rigs are trying to ditch them cheap..  this hurts the entire crypto market.. it’s like a domino effect.. awful
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:16:38
This is very true, it actually has no value what so ever.. but as friends like bitcoin we tend to think it has value because they do.. convince and Ye shall be convinced.
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:05:16
Probably the most logical statement on this thread, cheers.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:27:38
Well my mrs did as well. But she’s a long term hodler so that’s ok, they should still talk, 
They are your parents.
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:07:14
Ever think of the concept of “nest egg”, man the young generation today lol
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:46:35
We will see, timing in life is everything but never forget about the important factors in life, family, friends and your health.. keep these and you have already won.
@_date: 2018-11-24 09:01:36
Nice answer
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:56:44
Well, I don’t get why your so aggressive all the time, all Im doing is stating what I read,
There is a lot of information on the internet some may be true others may be not, but Im not spreading fud, it just makes interesting conversation, I’m sure people want to know what’s happening in the pipe line that’s all I guess.
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:58:00
No I’m more polite than that.. what an awful thing to do.
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:29:26
This is why I never shop at Aldi.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:32:45
I think everyone will call it quits to be honest
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:51:05
Just wait there will be no return on all cloud mining contracts.. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:55:26
Like anyone, no one can give financial advice, I only mentioned what I have done..
It’s up to you.. I just get worried about people with kids, because I don’t want to see a bad xmas for anyone.. that’s just me.. you decide..
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:54:32
Well I doubt that, there are probably many females here interested in bitcoin, but the real question is, is it all about the lambo? Lol
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:57:46
Hey bro, I didn’t say buy now, it’s being dumped and we all know it, but this is the way crypto roles brother, never catch falling knives, we all know the score, I’ve traded in options and warrants for years, so I think I’m on the same level as you but don’t criminalise bitcoin.. we just have to role with it.. as usual... pump and dumps included.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:19:37
No just know cryptos have to do what they do.. fact of life, nothing wrong with that.. if you need a friend I’m always here by the way. Cheers
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:04:42
Not in this case. Hate to rain on your parade.
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:03:12
I’d say $250 the real value.
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:46:06
You can tell he buys drugs with bitcoin,
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:48:07
 NIce well I just bought $12.50 of bitcoin, so if it goes down I only lose 9 dollars!
Not a bad loss short term but over time I make 1 million!
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:45:47
With a piece of lead on its back unfortunately 
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:15:11
Well when most people max out their 30 k credit cards the money just runs out I guess...
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:43:46
People will want refunds on their cloud mining contracts they paid years ahead on I’m sure
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:18:23
Awesome poised for 30k !
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:31:30
Cheers brother and thanks for thinking of your kids, they come first.. your a good man
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:32:12
What about all the cloud mining contracts people paid years in advance for?
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:43:44
Be real, be fake.
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:01:13
Nope just being myself actually, if you don’t like a topic you don’t have to read it, the choice is yours really, this topic obviously is not to your liking so why bother reading it?
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:59:04
Won’t see that again for a few years
