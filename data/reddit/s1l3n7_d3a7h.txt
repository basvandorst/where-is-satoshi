Potential solutions: elimination of all healthcare regulations and requirements for employers or individuals. Elimination of all forms of taxation. Elimination of various federal departments, state agencies, and any and all local legal regulations which in any manner restrict people from making voluntary interactions.

Then good luck to you and your son.

Won't comment much about the financial advice since that is your own choice. What isn't, is what your son does with their own life. Isn't it a bit early to essentially force your child into a situation they may have absolutely no interest in? I get that you love your son and want the best for them, but that is for them to decide. Support them in their own decisions. If you raise them to be a moral ethical person with sound philosophy through reason and evidence, they will make the right choices.

Also, certainly not a neo-libertarian. I have no sympathies for disgusting war mongering neocons nor do I believe in any sort of authoritarian structure being necessary to organize society. I believe in the spontaneous order that comes from free people able to interact freely with one another.

As serious as free helicopter rides for socialists.

I'm sure slave owners held strong convictions in their so called rights too keep and use slaves, and the benefits it provided society.
Socialized medicine, or anything for that matter has the same moral equivalency. Don't pretend it doesn't. You enjoy enslaving your fellow man. You are a very greedy, evil and reckless person.

Private being voluntary cooperation in an open and free, unregulated market, free of any restrictions on individuals and families from making choices of their own volition. National insurance being quite the opposite. Fraud force and coercion are required to implement a national policy. Not interested nor do I care for any utilitarian arguments for either. Much like people who wanted to end slavery didn't much care either for any utilitarian arguments; they understood slavery to be evil.

Do you understand the consequences of crypto currencies? Do you understand the end goal is to side step the government? Do you realize crypto currencies wage a war of attrition against all governments? For someone going around calling people a "fucking moron", you have no ground to stand on to prove you're not incompetent. You have only proved your lack of foresight and for abstract reasoning. You sir, are the fucking moron. Good day.

You're welcome to help people in need yourself, it is called charity. How about you learn to get things done without the use of violence and theft at the point of a gun by the thugs of the government?
