the whole FUD that get thrown from mass-media and old-fart 'experts' that you see it is not the decentralized-money thingy but the 'technology' behind is nothing but BS !!! it is the p2p-money the bong-shit !!!
etherium " the blockchain-tech " has no value at the moment....
it certainly has potential for new disruptive services...
certainly one can build cryptocurrancy using etherium but hey we have near 200 of those by now so why anything but bitcoin this ONE you must answer first !

"You dont have to be a CS major to understand how its used" 
this is not the point. there is no such thing as how it is used. it can be used in countless different ways.. many unimaginable for real physical tokens (money)
why trusting is the KEY question any reasonable person should have!

start thinking and thus one need to first understand and not follow hype first....

"Consider that most people trust airplanes enough to fly in them without having a good understanding of how a jet engine works." nobody understands why flying works in fact ! there are like 5 competing formulas and they all work ! :D fun fact .... however statistic has shown flying to be safe and that it works.... look back in time to see how first passengers were feeling :) afraid like....

no, gold in fact is used in most electrical devices and is hard to replace with something cheaper!
it has medicinal properties too ! unlike paper :)
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:24:19
not to mention bitcoin can divide to infinity while gold you reach a single atom and good luck sharing it with someone !
now do someone start seeing the benefit of bitcoin or am I shouting into the void?

"Meni Rosenfeld, thanks for the extra info. Im of the opinion that your point 4 (“4. An artifact of small sample size…. 4. I expect Mozilla had enough visitors to make the results statistically significantly.”) is where the problem lies because simply displaying the btc option and attributing that to the cause of reduced donation amounts is similar to saying the same problem arises for Visa payers when they see an AmEx or Paypal option / logo."

if that aint a good example of FUD about bitcoin :D
"most people in my circles get it, its been in the news enough."you dont get it from the news, you get after u spend some time researching and even more time to appreciate it !
I'm a CS major and it took me easily more than an year !!!
"As a user who actually wants to spend, ide have to hunt out a merchant who takes bitcoin. " fair well, but then again it is NEW and no NEW was adopted overnight unless it has a logo of half eaten apple on top :D
"From a merchants perspective, there are no big chain POS systems that allow you to seamlessly take bitcoin."
this is it.... It is hard to compete bitcoin with classic/standard approach to merchant-ship. Think about the possibility each product has its own bank-account and that you can print it q-barcode sticker and all a customer needs to do is a take a picture ... and this  one of the many NEW possibility opening.
the last point I don't get, but if it is about volatility.... it is not a problem not only now but in the past too. coinbase for one gives merchants the possibility to convert back to FIAT as soon a transaction occurs. Thus you can bind price of items to FIAT and care not about volatility.

To Dear Poster:

it boils down to where MtGox are willing to pay the price, but at least they will be operational and hopefully no blackouts.

"value of their money can change by 20% in 3minutes flat."
do your math, it is +30% -30%, if you add and sub all those in the past few weeks , you would realise that the fluctuation of bitcoin is ~0%
@_date: 2013-05-03 09:17:59
but thats exactly my point of how 'fragile' litecoin is by "supposing" for each possible hardware (architecture) that you will face the memory wall in computation. as you say it is up to debate, but it is a hot topic in HPC and HPC is getting even hotter , if you know what I mean.
so it is theoretically possible and very likely since many people (not from crypto-cur world) looking at the problem.
on the other hand bitcoin is Agnostic to hardware, since complexity is not bound by it. "that it's going to provide orders of magnitude increase as does the current fleet of Bitcoin ASIC devices" thats the whole point the current forming fleed will not affect bitcoin mining in the long terms , since difficulty is flexible/under control and it will self adjust to accommodate to the new rate of mining. only chill effect will be felt by GPU miners since most likely they will be out of the picture, same situation as CPU miner at one point in time were.

ASIC for litecoin, will let you mine all of litecoins in a weekend
ASIC for bitcoin, will make you profitable in short term, but the algorithm can self-adjust to accommodate for such a 'game-changer', because it controls the math-space of what a valid hash is!
mistake me if im wrong, but litecoin does not. it entirely depends on the math complexity of the cipher (scrypt) so it is VERY VERY vulnerable to have this vector of attack, where it is non-existent for bitcoin which control complexity by introducing extra restriction on what a valid is!
@_date: 2013-06-14 12:48:07
ABSOLUTELY, because technology is ultimately NEUTRAL! People are not!
@_date: 2013-04-25 09:37:45
what people portrait as advantage of litecoin, namely the scrypt cipher, is its biggest weak point IMO. the so portrait resilience of scrypte to easy mining is bad joke. I hope most people realise that. judging from the history that GPU are now mining. if not today tomorrow, someone will come wtih ASIC that will shit mine all litecoins in a weekend. You don't control difficulty by introducing more elaborated ciphers but by controlling the acceptable space of hashes. the way Bitcoin does it, you control difficulty by putting extra restriction on what a valid output is. e.g. introduce 1 more trailing 0 for each sha256 to be considered for a block etc.. 
this way you have way more flexibility and control, which otherwise is a static/hardcoded property of the hash-function of choice alone!
PLEASE, correct me if I'm wrong. also I assume litecone is not utilizing any restriction schema on its hash ala bitcoin.

it took me more than a year researching bitcoin to have a clear idea/model how it works in my mind. yet I am computer scientist! I doubt this guy had spent, or the guy who he refers to on youtube, even fraction of that time!
just to give an idea of how off he is with the mindblowing conclusion that magic the gathering card are more of currency than bitcoin :)))))
on the other hand, his economic view, albite I admit I'm not the most knowledgeable around to comment on, really flash the red light in my eyes!
overall it is a bundle of ignorance and misconceptions in a long post I found hard to read and follow!
