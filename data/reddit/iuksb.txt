They still recognize Internet Explorer 6 as a legit browser, so...

I am really concerned about most of the simili-bullish reactions that I can read on this subreddit. 
I am going to get flamed for it but saying "oh it's not a problem I am selling and buying more when it hits the bottom" is, in my opinion, not a bitcoin-friendly behavior.
Here is how I see bitcoin today :
-&gt; A great technology
-&gt; Tons of bullish and trigger happy people who just want to "hurt the banks" or to make easy money to "hurt the system"
-&gt; a few, very few (not enough) real investors and entrepreneurs investing in the technology  and actually making it a viable payment or store of value option
I am probably not right about this as I am not an economist nor a financial, but what I see is a huge bubble of overevaluated promising technology who has yet everything to prove, a huge excitement, lots of politics and talking, but not a lot of real things. 
Seriously, if you think common people are ready to pay with a wallet on their hard-drive and with complex adresses, exchanging bitcoins on platforms with no guarantees or backup, you're overestimating it.
Bitcoin is a great idea, very poorly marketed, not user-friendly, and with tons of people speculating on it. 
If you believe in btc, then you need projects, certified payment gateways, real companies and insured datacenters for the exchanges, projects that are made too change and improve people life, not made to make easy money with fees.
If this does not happen, then bitcoin will fail like another "internet payment supergateway". 
Bitcoin alone is not enough.
