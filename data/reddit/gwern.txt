Yes. Typically they go through something like Bitpay to sell it immediately. It would be extraordinarily irresponsible of a charity to hold onto something like Bitcoin instead of immediately selling it (remember, they get to avoid any capital gains as a charity) and spending it on their charitable mission as soon as possible. A charity is not supposed to be a cryptocurrency hedge fund.

Good luck arguing that investing in cryptocurrency passes the fiduciary standard for a non-crypto-related charity... Most investors or financial experts would advise against even touch crypto, much less it being such a non-controversial good idea that it can hope to meet the fiduciary standard, the highest possible standard.
*Accepting* cryptocurrency if the expected gain exceeds the distraction and transaction costs, absolutely. If a big donor wants to donate via crypto, certainly one often wants to work with them especially given the tax implications, no different than if they were donating stock shares or something. *Holding* enormously volatile assets which could easily go to zero is totally different! A charity is not supposed to be a cryptocurrency hedge fund speculating on future bubbles, and holding fiat (or more realistically, money market or bonds) is not remotely comparable.

I haven't thought that ever since 5 April 2014 when the gold symbolism was pointed out to me and it was obviously an easter egg. (Wright was born in October, anyway.)

I think that he was simply thinking about the next step past Bitcoin towards a general property registry, and gold is, besides being a major interest of both Wright and Satoshi, a logical thing to track this way. It's good to have specific use-cases when you're designing things.

You've got it backwards. The documents were leaked to me, not the other way around. And judging by [the parallel Gizmodo investigation]( there's even multiple leakers running around stepping on each others' toes. (This is not too surprising. Wright has made a lot of enemies. There's a lot of people who would love to talk about Wright but are worried he'll sue the living daylights out of them.)

This reminds me of one of my favorite Haldane quotes:


@_date: 2015-12-22 19:17:19
Why release them at all? If they are forged, then Wright is not Satoshi and there is no compelling public interest in having them all public, especially since the forgery in this case would have to be of the form of taking a large batch of legitimate documents and inserting a few fake bits and so release would include a lot of other people's real data and personal details. Do you really think we should have taken the Gizmodo route of including, say, all the sordid and unnecessary details of Kleiman's death? 'you might as well release it all. Why wouldn't you?'
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:00:26
It made sense, and I stand by it as a reasonable inference from the evidence. America is much bigger, modern crypto is almost entirely done here, he was running Bitcoin from a Californian IP in January 2009 on Freenode, and why would an Aussie be making references to *American* monetary history anyway? Taken as a whole, my full list of inferences about Satoshi did pretty well, I thought, even though I was surprised on a few.
By the way, are you still standing by the tax year thing even though Wright too is a gold bug?

@_date: 2015-12-09 05:04:58


No. Wright has been battling the ATO for 15 years now. Hotwire went into bankruptcy 100% *because* of the ATO. The leaks indicate he has had huge tax problems forever and that is why he nearly went bankrupt, not the mining. Maybe they were going to raid his house on Monday rather than today, but the raid was coming regardless of whether we published our article, Gawker published their article, or both of us published nothing.
(Besides, Wright isn't in Australia, he left partly because of this, it seems. So under no circumstance would he be dead.)

I'm not sure ASICs significantly optimize calculating a single SHA hash compared to calculating it on a normal CPU; mining ASICs vastly outperform GPUs and CPUs but that's because they're using parallelism to calculate thousands of hashes in parallel. And even if they wind up being 10 or 20% faster, that's still well within one's capabilities to create a time-lock for (you run your GPU for 10 seconds rather than 5 seconds to set up the hash chain).

Exactly. OP's shamelessly equivocating on what 'the rise is caused by Greece' means; maybe it's not caused by a bunch of individual Greeks buying bitcoins given the lack of Greek IPs and difficulty for them to move around money now, but it could very easily be 'caused by Greece' in the sense of people around the world increasing estimated risk of bank accounts &amp; fiat holdings and responding by buying more bitcoins on the margin.

He didn't ignore it. He saw it, and wasn't interested. (Publicly.)


I lost track of that debate a long time ago, but it looks to me like the most viable surviving Satoshi-Wright theory is that he did fake those as part of trying to firm up his backstory in either another ill-judged overreach on his part akin to the degrees (eg. he does have a lot of the degrees he claims and he did get that PhD, I downloaded his CS thesis a while ago and skimmed it\*, but his arrogance and insecurity leads him to overstate his claims in a way which ultimately backfires dramatically, similar to how people get carried away in arguments and make too sweeping claims or get sloppy in ways not actually necessary for their points and get refuted or use sockpuppets) or as part of his theft from Kleiman.

[Stylometrics]( doesn't work the way you think it does: usually, you throw out most of the text like nouns and whatnot, and you focus on subtle things like pronouns and particles - words like 'but' and 'and'. When you look at this butter cookies review and think 'it sounds like a moron compared to the whitepaper and it doesn't have *any* cryptography jargon', you are not looking at it like many stylometric programs would.
I mean, let's apply some common sense here. Dorian Nakamoto is, by the testimony of his family and his apparent career, a smart technically-inclined cookie completely independent of whether he is Satoshi Nakamoto. So clearly it is possible to be Dorian Nakamoto *and also* write casual reviews and emails; given that this must be the case, unless you think he's actually a drooling moron who has somehow fooled all his siblings and children over a lifetime, why is it so hard to believe that he could also have written the Satoshi Nakamoto materials by trying harder when writing them? Or to try another direction: supposing that these reviews really show the upper limit of Dorian Nakamoto's writing skills - how many government employers would tolerate this caliber of writing from an engineer?

Which he might've. And that person promptly forgot about it or didn't mention it in the lawsuit because that's how people work. You get told a lot of things that you don't remember 10 minutes later, much less walk into a court and demand to file an amicus curiae brief on. (What exactly did you have in mind here...? This is not a very hard argument from silence.)


Sure. But you're drifting from your original point here. They don't need to prove Wright is Satoshi because they have a more modest position to sue him over, the supposed mining.


Er, yes, by me. I am well aware of his online footprint. And he didn't talk about a lot of things online. His presence was mostly attempts at self-advertisement and technical matters.


I mean exactly that. According to the leaked documents he emailed his lawyer and a few other people copies of the whitepaper to read and serve as a timestamping record back somewhere in 2007 or 2008, I forget. They would of course have copies and would remember it. But they *could* be cooperating with the whole thing, so it's not as interesting as Ira claiming an unforgeable thing like that anecdote.


Most people assume that if Wright isn't Satoshi, it must be Szabo. You believe Wright isn't Satoshi, so you have a bullet to bite there, between either the evidential value of apparently being uninterested publicly in Bitcoin or ruling out Szabo as well. Your point  only emphasizes this: someone obsessed with digital money could, apparently, almost totally miss out on Bitcoin's importance early on.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:15:11
Szabo and Finney may be logical candidates because they worked on related ideas, but it seems a little paranoid to suggest that Finney was part of Satoshi (like, on 10 Jan 2009: why would Finney publicly mail Satoshi complaining about bitcoin-0.1.0 crashing when he tried to receive a transaction? why not just quietly fix it yourself when you tested your code and noticed it was crashing? if you were sockpuppeting, you'd want to fix the crash, push a fresh release, and then sockpuppet a congratulatory 'it worked!' message, not 'your shit's all fucked up, man'!), and has Szabo ever written C or C++?

Speculation, and a highly improbable one at that; as [I've pointed out before]( just compare the death toll to the total Japanese population.

Of course it is suspiciously convenient, which is why I said 'assuming Ira Kleiman is not lying out his ass'. This whole mess has involved a number of liars, one way or another.


Ira had no way of knowing what the Bitcoin stuff had amounted to or who was involved. Saying he should have gone insane tracking down everything is simply hindsight bias. My family had an old friend who once mentioned he had $100k in Swiss gold saved away (he was indeed a gold bug); no one in our family or his family has any idea what happened to it and no one has done anything about it, because he denied he was ever going to die and refused to make a will or prepare any kind of documentation, and because given that, what can you do? Nothing. If some banker emails us/them about it out of the blue, *then* something can be done about it, but until then, it's just something mentioned once every couple of years if even that. ("Say, whatever happened to Arthur's gold?" "Who knows. Maybe he didn't have any. He was a very weird guy.") And we have the advantage of knowing that gold is a real thing which is definitely worth money, not some weird Internet funny money thing which is probably a scam.


Of course not. It's all based on the mining they supposedly did. Anyone could've been a miner back then.


His footprint is very selective.


Yes, but they're also dubious. For example, Lynn Wright told Buzzfeed that Wright was indeed mining back in 2009 or so, and she should know better than anyone else, but then she walked her claim back. Why? No idea. Similarly, several people should've received copies from Wright of the whitepaper long before it was public and so have proof (at least to themselves) that he+Kleiman was Satoshi, but most of them are involved in the businesses so also have incentive to go along. When I say independent, I mean not based on documents written or could've been modified by Wright, and so requiring other people to be lying &amp; cooperating with Wright, enlarging the scam and making it less probable.


One could say the same thing of, say, Nick Szabo, whose first mention of Bitcoin is an offhanded mention in a link roundup on his blog... Most people were not enthusiastic about Bitcoin initially, to say the least.

If the markets were remotely efficient, this should have been priced in. That all these coins were going to be sold was officially announced back in *October 2013*.

No, it didn't. As far as I can tell, as verified by the Internet Archive, McCaleb interviews, and domain reports with snapshots, MtGox *never* was a card trading service. It was a lapsed domain followed by a landing page advertisement for McCaleb's other projects which became a Bitcoin exchange when he decided that was needful.

It's also ridiculous that Ulbricht linked the first SR advertising to his real name. It's also ridiculous that he backed up the SR server to a US backup service.

SR2 did not have autofinalize or a dispute center implemented; this means that the balance, for every single transaction since December where the customer did not explicitly release funds to the vendor, was still being held by SR2 and could be stolen. (SR1 had both autofinalize and dispute center, so even though it did way more business than SR2 does, it was holding onto less of its turnover.) This made a lot of people nervous but...

I think it makes sense given the constraints. If he put in 1933, then the age displays really weirdly (he's 76?) and it's not a very good easter egg for being so blatantly fake; so he can only put in the day of the banning if at all. And if he goes with the day in 1975 gold was legalized, then he loses any direct reference to the banning since now he's referring only to one date rather than two. By combining the two dates, he gets a plausible age (so plausible that no-one noticed the easter egg for 5 full years despite intense international interest in him) and he gets in both allusions to the greed of government and capriciousness of its rules (the government giveth and taketh).
It's almost showoffy clever, especially if he came up with it on the spur of the moment.

What SR did was combine Tor, Bitcoin, and escrow. *That* is what made it so unique and so successful.

The problem with squaring and Rivest's original time-lock approach is that we don't know how well squaring resists approaches like ASICs, and it doesn't involve one of the great equalizers, the memory hierarchy.
We have a pretty good idea of the limits of serial SHA because of all the Bitcoin-related work that has gone into optimizing SHA hashing, which makes it much less likely we'll be surprised by, say, someone cracking a time-lock in a tenth of the time we expected it to take. Even better would be to use a memory-bound hash like scrypt or something, but beggars can't be choosers.
(This lesser predictability has actually been a problem for Rivest's squaring challenge: he set the difficulty based on an extrapolation of Moore's law for serial performance which broke down a few years ago, so it'll take years longer to unlock than he expected.)

No, you couldn't. Please note the part of my suggestion where I suggest 'a very high work factor' precisely to prevent brute forcing. If he uses an adjustable hash like scrypt or bcrypt to require many thousands of iterations so that hashing it takes, say, 24 hours, then you will have a hard time getting through very many names in, say, a decade, at which point he presumably doesn't much mind the revelation.

FWIW, I got a copy of that from Grieve.

Google tries a lot of stuff. I even made a list for you of all the stuff they try and which ones failed: 


Uh huh. And in 15 years, the current ones will have gone onto using email, and the new students will be using AssBook and FaceApp, and 15 years ago, all your old students were using AIM and IRC chat rooms. The thing about teens and students' usage patterns is that they tend to stop being teens and students at some point.


I am not aware of any statistics showing that email 'took a nose dive'.

You presented worthless anecdotal evidence, and I pointed out that people have been telling that kind of story for a long where they confused a subdemographic's habits for historical inevitability. You claimed email had "nose-dived", which would be news, but when asked for a cite, declined. And so on.

I think you overestimate how much bitcoin-days-destroyed matters.
Suppose Satoshi moved a block of 50, and it's the oldest possible block, a block mined on 9 January 2009 (IIRC); then that was 1921 days ago, and so the bitcoin-days-destroyed would be 96,050.
How big is 100k bitcoin-days-destroyed? Not very: if you look at your link's 7-day averages, the daily bitcoin-days-destroyed averages from 3-8 million and sometimes much much higher (peaking at 44 million).
So Satoshi would have to move at least 40 block-rewards (worth ~$800k right now) to merely double daily bitcoin-days-destroyed, and he would have to move way more than that to begin to approach any of the previous peaks.
So, he could easily shift his holdings 40 blocks at a time without alarming anyone watching that graph.
The *real* problem is that those early addresses would draw attention purely because of what addresses they are, not because of any metric they are influencing.

I'm not sure that 6% is unprecedented throughout all human history... To look at just the present moment: the single largest bank I am aware of right now is the Japan Post Bank, with assets of 196 trillion yen, or ~$2t, let's say. Global GDP is ~$84t, so JPB's ~$2t is already at 2.4% or more than a third of the way there to your impossible 6%. 
(Apparently global net wealth has been estimated at $223t by Credit Suisse, although I dunno how one could make anything but a wild guess at such a figure, which would put JPB at 0.9%, still within an order or so of 6%.)

Ross Ulbricht did trading on Mtgox (you can see him discussing his buys/sells and doing some currency speculation on Bitcointalk), and his Silk Road commissions would all have passed through Mtgox multiple times (Mtgox was pretty much the only viable way for SR users at the time), so I'm not sure how much that means...

Just off the top of my head: 'send to IP'. Early on you were only supposed to send bitcoins to someone's *IP*, not their *address*. (You can actually see this in one of the quotes in OP, C-f for 'IP'.)

My first question is: why think that only buzz or 'innovation potential' can drive price changes? It's perfectly possible for price changes to drive buzz. I think of every other time that I visit There was a massive amount of media coverage over the years for various milestones - $1b market cap, $100/bitcoin, $1000/bitcoin etc etc. And lots of people apparently only heard of and became interested in Bitcoin after reading articles about it, including of course a lot of speculators and lay people who probably shouldn't've been interested. You would normally think that it would be a feedback cycle: buzz can drive price changes and innovation potential (developers are people too! and cryptocurrency devs need jobs, which will be for successful cryptocurrencies, and even for the hobbyists - why work on a failing cryptocurrency?), and price changes can drive buzz and innovation potential, and of course innovation potential can also drive buzz and price changes. I don't see any obvious way to apportion causal responsibility unless you can find some sort of clever natural experiment like half the money supply being accidentally destroyed or some randomized bit of mass media coverage.
Also, the idea of controlling for supply is weird in the context of Bitcoin. One of the points of Bitcoin is that the supply increases at a stable pre-programmed rate; the only way to increase the supply faster than predicted is to bring more hashpower online (since the difficulty resets every few weeks, anyone who sets up a new mining farm temporarily causes blocks to happen faster than every 10 minutes) which is... something you would do if the price increases (because then the block reward increases in real value, encouraging miners to turn on more hashpower, mining more blocks faster, until the reset happens and the required electricity goes way up and makes the block reward no longer unusually profitable). This is why there are actually quite a few more bitcoins in existence than you would calculate starting from the first block in 2009 and multiplying by the expected number of blocks - miners have brought online so much hashpower that many rewards were mined before re-adjustments. So in Bitcoin and other PoW-based coins, a price increase can cause a supply increase, making it questionable to 'control' for deltas.


Well sure, of course that has value, but why would that drive any *change* in the price? Bitcoin, technologically speaking, has scarcely changed at all in the past few years. That is, in fact, its biggest problem - blocks are the same size; hardly anyone uses the few new features like nlocktime; lightning networks, segwitness, Rootstock, and sidechains in general are all still technologies of the future (and given the stalemate over block sizes, may always be technologies of the future). Since the technology is the same, the change in Bitcoin's value as a payment medium &amp; store of value would seem to come from network effects... or buzz and greater adoption (as signaled by a rising price - more demand for a fixed supply)?


Stellar doesn't illustrate it at all. It's nothing but an explicit fork/clone of Ripple by Jed McCaleb after falling out with Ripple. It brings nothing to the table except getting rid of the Ripple Labs premine and is not an illustration of any wave. Also, no one uses it.
The selection of 5 coins (Bitcoin/Litecoin/Peercoin/Ripple/Stellar) is a little odd. Why Stellar, and not Doge or Ethereum or Litecoin or Monero? Doge was the epitome of hype and media-driven cryptocurrency growth, while Ethereum has evolved frantically, making it the epitome of a 'innovation potential' driven coin and Monero has a major selling point in being anonymous and Litecoin is one of the oldest large active cryptocurrencies &amp; introduced several innovations of its own (scrypt-based PoW and faster blocks, the former of which was bungled and proven to be a flawed or useless change). But there must be dozens of cryptocurrencies which had larger market caps and more use than Stellar, which is redundant with their inclusion of Ripple as well.


Well, yes, that's because *Bitcoin* represents like 90%+ of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Why even bother including the others? How on earth did they pick these? The selection seems totally arbitrary. (Serious question: was there ever any media coverage or community interest which could be measured for Peercoin? If the other coins were thrown out, a lot of measurement issues would be avoided, and the time series could be extended back years.)


The time-series model is very simple, so I can't complain about that. It's just unrealistic and unmotivated. How did they decide on using only 1-week lags? And no moving average? Most time-series will have more lags than that (the price is totally independent of increases/decreases from two weeks ago? there's no lag or momentum? really? despite all the Bitcoin bubbles?) and moving averages are very effective at forecasting (this is why it's ARI*MA* models).

I find it puzzling but I don't have any good ideas. Maybe it's just that no one is in a hurry - Benthall is damned by his name on the server accounts, his laptop, Tesla, activity correlation, and has already confessed, so it's not like it matters. He has no hope of fighting and everyone knows it, so the negotiations on the details can go as slowly as everyone wants. Maybe his prosecutors have been busy with the Ulbricht trial and now that sentencing is over, can start catching up with backlogs like Benthall?

We can rule that out as a major factor: most people simply aren't setup to exploit such an opportunity (you have to have coins on SR *at that moment*, have been the rare Redditor or person hearing about it, decide to exploit it, and have an order already premeditated), and if any significant amount of people had exploited it, DPR would simply have disabled it or outright quashed all the orders. Further, given that the total monthly turnover was a few million, even if DPR ate the entire loss of 50%, it could only have been a loss of a million or two. So not a huge factor.


He would have paid normal rates, so since he ordered something like 9, that was maybe $1k. A rounding error when we're discussing a fortune in the hundreds of millions of dollars at its peak.


He didn't get too far since his discussions with NOD and Btcking were mostly theoretical - no one even knew about those plans for the longest time. And you can't lose much money on running an exchange which doesn't exist.

Don't forget that he lost everything in his Mtgox hedging account when someone hacked it and drained it. 400k btc is a lot, but remember he made almost all of them in the early days when a btc wasn't worth much and SR1 was not doing much in the way of sales, so he could also spend a lot of it easily.

I think you can see the problem with that...
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:51:28
No, it's a little more complex than that. Review sections are generally date-stamped only to the day, and often only go back so far, so you only get sales for the last X days and you have to merge and deal with overlaps. The product mix also changes over time: the first sellers onto any market are usually digital goods sellers (like porn subscriptions) and maybe some relatively cheap drugs like marijuana, and then later on you start seeing things like opiates and sellers who have decided to trust a market with escrow for big orders like 1kg of cocaine, so going from 0-&gt;100 sellers is not the same as going from 100-&gt;200 sellers. Seller listings disappear when sellers do exit scams, so depending on how often you scrape, you can wind up being given a misleading picture; for example, if you had scraped SR2 in November 2014 and calculated average stars for reviews, your average would be biased upwards by easily half a star and your revenue estimate biased downwards by many thousands of dollars simply because SR2 was a notorious scammer-haven and only the non-scammers were present in your scrape. E-book sellers routinely try to put in dozens or even hundreds of listings if a market will let them get away with it, essentially spamming searches/categories, which screws up any count. And speaking of SR2, they may have been manipulating their listing counts in the first place - one of my collaborators, using my SR2 scrapes, tells me that the category-total number (which was usually ~12k in Nov 2014) seems to have usually overstated by several thousand how many listings there actually were, although we're not sure if it was yet another SR2 bug (perhaps some caching or counting issue) or incompleteness of the crawl or deliberate to make SR2 seem more important compared to its competitors Evo &amp; Agora.
So, \# of listings on a single day is an OK way of measuring growth and comparing markets, but I would not call it 'almost perfect'. Getting accurate numbers for markets based on regular scrapes is a lot of work, which is one reason there's hardly any such analyses like Christin et al 2013's SR1 paper.
@_date: 2015-01-24 15:51:08
No. Ulbricht ate the loss, it wasn't Mtgox's problem. Further, the timing is all wrong: the Willy Bot started operation in November 2013, I believe - or half a year *after* the account went dormant in May 2013 and months after SR1 was raided &amp; Ulbricht arrested in October 2013, so the hedging account was not doing the Willy trades.
(Unless you want to get into very speculative theories like that the hedging account theft somehow caused Mtgox to go bankrupt and in desperation they began using Willy Bot to market-manipulate their way back into solvency, anyway...)

Never heard of CoinGecko, and the supposed 'validation' reference isn't online, but Github is an imperfect measurement of developer activity and an even more imperfect measure of technical innovation. Especially since, you know, none of that actually measures innovations, just churn in the codebase and public talk. (Plus, if they're using Coinmarketcap, they could've used tons of cryptocoins, not such a weirdo selection.) When I look at Table 3, the correlations of their various variables, why does 'negative publicity' correlate r=.59 with 'technological development' and r=.92 with 'alternative interest (community)'? And liquidity is highly correlates with 'public interest', 'negative publicity', 'technological development', 'alternative liquidity' and 'alternative interest'. What this tells me is that despite their attempts to split out 'public interest', 'negative publicity', and 'technological development', all I see is a single buzz/activity variable. I mean, what else are we supposed to think? That the general public and programmers hear about something like MtGox or Shrem being arrested and go, 'oh, Bitcoin! that sounds awesome! I want to buy/program some of that'? A factor analysis would likely bear it out, showing that those load on a single factor, and then are independent of weekly returns/supply growth, which are correlated. A multicollinearity test does not address this issue; it merely means that splitting the publicity factor over multiple variables doesn't make the estimates unstable, but it does mean that which variable gets assigned the most variance is fairly arbitrary.


Oy vey. So the validation is probably meaningless anyway, as they won't give out 'proprietary information'.


The claim about Bitcoin's supply being fixed is wrong, as I've previously commented. The attribution to random noise in blocks makes no sense: they are working on weekly timescales, and over a week there will be `10*6*24*7=10,080` blocks on average and by the law of large numbers, the random fluctuations will be tiny; and this tiny deviation would measured by simply counting the blocks! What is this about measuring 'the number of coins actually in circulation at any point in time'? Are they using a count of Bitcoin total transaction volume as the measure of supply?! (Wow, I can't imagine any reason why the amount of coins flying around would have anything to do with price increases... /s). So through both miners bringing hashpower online and by measuring velocity/total transaction turnover, as including "unexpected variations in supply" you are also measuring public demand/buzz and hence hiding away its influence.


By definition, their 'total mentions' number will correlate with their 'negative publicity' number, because the former is made up of the latter + positive publicity. After all, the number of Bitcoin articles cannot be less than the number of negative Bitcoin articles.


Wrong. Adding a variable to a regression model is not adding a mediation and cannot tell you if the correlation is mediated through that channel or not. You may not be interested in structural equation models, but SEMs are interested in you...
The plethora of models and tests and lack of pre-registered plan or any coherent approach also raises the usual questions about _p_-values and 'the garden of forking paths'. Does anyone think that if they set out to do a conceptually similar study - grab some price series from Coinmarketcap, traffic data from Twitter and Reddit, # of commits per day on Github - that they would wind up getting remotely similar results? I don't.


Miners don't turn on hashpower as a 'signal' or to speculate on Bitcoin (if they wanted to do that, they would simply not sell their incoming coins), they turn it on in *response to higher prices*, as higher prices mean it becomes profitable to spend more electricity trying to mine blocks.


There is nothing representative about this panel, and it is a bug not a feature to ignore the time period in which Bitcoin saw the majority of its growth!
So to sum up my problems with this analysis, the big ones are that it
- uses an unrepresentative and redundant set of cryptocurrencies
- over a short and unrepresentative time period
- to investigate a model which ignores all feedbacks and interactions between variables and returns, implicitly ignoring all possibility of network effects &amp; bubbles
- using opaque proprietary 'measurements' of various latent constructs unlikely to measure well what they claim to measure
    - which heavily intercorrelate or literally measure the same data, indicating a single 'publicity' factor which is ignored
- to make causal claims which are not and cannot be supported by the model and data
- in support of an interpretation (Bitcoin's returns September 2014 - August 2015 are driven by technological 'innovation potential') which lack any face validity (*what* technological innovation September 2014 - August 2015?)
Maybe buzz and hype and the media matter a lot less than most people think to Bitcoin's growth. But this paper doesn't affect my beliefs on the matter one bit.

And if those in-depth research pieces present anything new or are valuable in their own right, then releasing the transcript to your rival newspapers helps them write their own such pieces and is bad.
You do understand the idea of 'competition', right?


Which might also help your competitors too.
Newspapers are not charities. They are not nonprofits. They are not universities publishing peer-reviewed papers. They are not here to buy and release the documents you want them to. They are not in business to make a better world.
They are commercial entities who want to make a profit. Helping your competition write better articles does not increase your profits.


But at least they aren't getting it for free or cheap.
The Nash equilibrium here is newspapers settle for reporters attending the trial and don't buy the transcripts, and if they do, they don't release it to the public, and they *certainly* don't release it to their *competitors*.

If this is a con, he's studied the Bitcoin prototype closely enough to notice the poker functionality and emphasize that part of his own background; and certainly more than closely enough to notice the crypto++ library dependency and big chunks of copy-pasted code from it.

Yes. If you look at the correlations for all of the others with each other, you see for non-Bitcoin classes, all are correlations &gt;|0.48|; you can hedge some of them with each other, but diversifying still leaves you with a volatile portfolio. Bitcoin has all listed correlations &lt;|0.36|. As diversification is one of the few free lunches in investment... 
(Still, the caption specifies that this was based on absolute Bitcoin price, not log-transformed, and I have to wonder if that makes the correlations nonsensical. Wouldn't the sheer growth curve guarantee low 'correlations' even if it's highly correlated in terms of percentage growth with another asset class?)

The  code part is probably a reference to copying crypto++ code, which was mostly written by Dai. B-money was never more than a short outline or proposal, so there's no way one could copy code from it.

That's an interesting point. But it has to be a area of the world which is sufficiently well run to have reasonably cheap electricity. China has capital controls, but alternative ways of smuggling capital out only cost like 10-20%, so if the local electricity was that much higher than other jurisdictions, it wouldn't work. You couldn't get your capital out of Venezuela right now by mining bitcoins even if you had the ASICs in country.

And your objection is still silly. There are no grounds to interpret that comment as totally made-up when it is obvious what he meant and something he would know given how much research he has put into it.

He never says he used the B-money code, since there was none. They are referenced as separate things, and he doesn't claim to have drawn on B-money in the quotes, just to admire it. The original design was inspired by Ijiri's triple-entry accounting and Grigg's public cryptographic version of it, and B-money and Bitgold were things he learned of only after circulating the drafts because he either didn't know of them or had forgotten them.
@_date: 2016-06-05 23:40:02
But if you already have bitcoins, why are you mining? So, I have bitcoins and I'm stuck in Venezuela, so I sell them for bolivars, to pay the electricity power plant (if it's running at all at this point), to... mine bitcoins?

Yeah, it's puzzling. The three main theories there seem to be: 1. he's worried about signing enabling theft from some sort of key reuse vulnerability issue which was in Bitcoin a long time ago but which has apparently been explained to him was also fixed (? I never saw any writeup or explanation of what that was all about); 2. he doesn't want to provide conclusive proof which can be used against him; 3. the early keys are in the trust documents and can't be used at all (or maybe given all the Kleiman stuff we should amend this theory to, 'Kleiman had the keys for a lot of these blocks and they are lost or in Ira's possession').


No idea.


While working on the Wired story, we did email him before everything went public, hoping to get an in-depth interview.

I think the difference is that by this point in the scenario, 'any random bitcoin' is actually tiny accounts with millibitcoins etc (which have become worth ordinary real-world sums because of deflation). Hence, those accounts may be equally difficult to attack, but there would be no profit in it.
So if someone is going to spend the computing power to crack any bitcoin at all, they're going to go after the biggest outstanding balance in the blockchain, whatever that is. (Sort of like a perverse kind of mining;  I'm not sure if the instant reverse-inflation is more worrisome than the prospect that the computing power cheapness trends would continue to the point where 'contemporary' accounts *are* worth attacking.)

Yeah, I was reading up on this recently: the D-Wave chip only implements an adiabatic optimization quantum algorithm, which degrades into a classical optimization. So it may not actually be using any quantum effects in the first place. Even if it did, adiabatic optimization is not Shor's algorithm, so I'm not sure it can attack SHA; even if it could, it would only halve the effective hash length, leaving Bitcoin fairly secure. (The other crypto in Bitcoin IIRC is all elliptic stuff which is safe from quantum attacks so far.)

There is also the problem that 1998 is too early for Satoshi to have the idea of Bitcoin. He described it as fairly recent when he was discussing it early on and that he had the insight of removing third-parties via PoW only while working on it.

Yes, this was my own thought reading the paper: given the early cutoff of the paper data, and then the further cutoff of before 3 months and also the specified use (mined but not transferred far), these 'hoarded' coins are almost certainly the lost coins of the early miners and in particular Satoshi's outstanding balance - none of whom have any incentive to dump coins, assuming they even still have the keys to them.

No. The busy work is designed precisely to be busy work and impossible to solve without a lot of busy work.
Would it be nice if the hash-race could perform double-duty as calculations useful in their own right for some reason other than being verifiable proofs-of-work for the blockchain? Yes, it would! It would be like getting something for nothing.
But unfortunately it's not obvious how to do this. I've given [some thought to it before]( but the problem is: how do you come up with a problem which is guaranteed to be hard, guaranteed to not be solvable *before* it appears in the network, and yet is also useful in practice?
If it's not guaranteed to be hard, then you lose a lot of security - people can wait for a series of easy problems to come along and do double-spends. If it's solvable before it is broadcast, someone could pre-calculate offline a bunch of solved problems and do an attack that way. And if it satisfies the hardness and not-precomputable requirements, then maybe it's not useful! Who decides?
If anyone has cracked this problem, I haven't heard of it.

They are a good firm but as others are pointing out, that doesn't necessarily mean they vouch for the claims or have the expertise - remember Ceglia's fake contract which meant he owned Facebook? All that is necessary is for BSF to take it on contingency and decide it's good enough for a junior associate to spend some time on it. After all, it's not every day that you get a $10b (or will it be $20b by the end?) lawsuit. If Ira Klein agreed to a, say, 5% contingency fee, the expected value pays for a heck of a lot of lawyer time and any publicity is a bonus.
Personally, I am disappointed by what I see in the complaint and exhibits. I learned a lot less than I expected to from the inevitable Kleiman lawsuit. As far as I can tell, all of this material is either public, post-2013 emails from Wright, or probably sourced from Wright like the critical one which was already in the leaks &amp; is unverifiable. There is no indication that Ira Kleiman has access to Dave Kleiman's personal email accounts (which could verify the date of emails like the critical one asking for help on Bitcoin) rather than forwarded copies from Wright, or that he has found any primary source material or any Bitcoins whatsoever in Dave Kleiman's surviving files in his house (which ought to be untamperable with by Wright). Of course, often in lawsuits people hold back their best material since they only want to establish enough grounds for the lawsuit, and discovery may turn up more, but still, disappointing. I suppose we'll have to see what Wright's response is. He is being flippant on Twitter but it must concern him at least a little, because the UK will enforce US judgments.

Ah. I don't think I've seen any mention of such use of ICE subpoenas in the black-market cases so far... Typically ICE's role has been to intercept packages, and occasionally they'll exploit the rights-free nature of border crossings. (The most striking example is the Dutch seller SuperTrips: they had found a fingerprint on a package and so had a good guess that he was involved, but they don't seem to have had anything remotely like real proof - until, that is, SuperTrips decided to take a trip to the US, and while detained in the airport, his unencrypted laptop was searched because they didn't need a warrant or anything while he was still at the border, and he had all his drug sales recorded inside it. Then he was definitely screwed.)

I have a fairly clear picture of Szabo's biography, but my understanding of the protohistory of Bitcoin isn't notably good other than people tend to think Bitcoin is younger than it is and a few random tidbits like finding Satoshi is a goldbug and Satoshi was at a California IP in 2009, that sort of thing.


No, it's more that, having effectively invaded Szabo's and other's privacy in researching this topic, I see zero reason to compound my offenses by making any of the biographical information public (other than shooting down dumb hypotheses). If Szabo is Satoshi, then he's a public figure and his life is fair game to write about and should I ever find a smoking gun (well beyond just the weak clues I've dug up) I'll probably do just that; but if he's not, then he's just a guy whose blog I've enjoyed reading since before Bitcoin even existed, and who am I to post info about him?

Even if we wanted to argue that the expected value of bitcoin was equal to or higher than gold because of the much discussed potential for 'takeoff', utility is not logarithmic in wealth! From one's present wealth to $20 million would change one's life far more than $20 million to $200 million or whatever, and risking the value going to zero *is not* compensated by the potential upside.
Past a few million, people ought to be highly risk-averse. Bitcoin is far more risky than gold - even if gold falls all the way back into the doldrums of the 1970s or whatever, that's still... what, $5m of gold? In contrast, if Bitcoin falls back to the doldrums of a few months ago, that $20m because maybe a few hundred thousand at best.

I'm not sure about either of those claims. 6-10 transitional offices sounds *grotesquely* inefficient - watching packages being tracked through Fedex or UPS, they don't stop in more than 2 or 3 intermediate centers, and this makes perfect sense since each stop is expensive and eats time.
Also, why would every stop along the way check for cancellation? The financial benefit of catching an uncanceled stamp is pretty small, and the machines are probably pretty expensive (they always are), so it doesn't sound like such redundancy pays for itself. Once it has entered the USPS system...

1. You need at least basic knowledge. With Tor, it's probably enough to know how to browse through tor in an 'privacy mode' or a separate mode. With Bitcoin, you need to know how to transfer between addresses, otherwise you obviously can't do the coinmix thing. You could transfer straight to SR and hope their cointumblers are up to snuff... but is that a risk worth taking? You also do need to understand basic GPG, although the recipes in the article are all you really need to know - how to store a public key and encrypt a text file against that key.
2. There were many vendors and only a few with ratings (as covered). Reading through reviews, it looks like the risk of a bad seller is something like 1 in 10.
3. Hypothetically, if I wanted something listed on it, yes. I don't know whether I will; Bitcoins are a hassle to get and not many nootropics are listed.
4. You're correct. I'm not sure whether Silk Road will last out the year. I think it probably will. I don't worry so much about scammers. (If nothing else, the fee for seller accounts will seriously discourage that.) I'm more worried that there will be Fed infiltration scaring off the better sellers, reducing the marketplace quality in a vicious loop. (Network effects can operate both ways.)

Well, what Wagner says isn't really important now. This is a basic feature of all major prediction sites (WrongTomorrow, Long  Bets, Prediction Book, the prediction markets like Intrade, etc.): no retroactive predictions. (This is also a feature of the best studies of predictions &amp; experts like Philip Tetlock's famous long-term study.) There's no way to do retroactive judging of predictions without teetering into bias and politics.
Personally, I disagree with your final comments. If wishes were fishes... Predictions are about the real world, and in the real world, hacks and bubbles are normal expected phenomena. A verse I saw somewhere runs: "_Since the beginning / not one unusual thing has happened_".
If your predictions can't handle normal exogenous events, then they are still wrong. (Tetlock identifies this as a common failure mode of hedgehogs: "I was actually right! *but for* X Y Z...")

If the SR existed at a regular domain, why do you assume that 'silkroad.com' is the real deal and not a scam for people who are actually looking for 'silkroad.org'? Suppose you get a public key from someone and you verify it against the fingerprint - well, why do you trust the *fingerprint*? Why couldn't there be a MITM attack starting with the fingerprint?

My understanding was that it is, and has long been, standard law enforcement operating procedure to spend most resources going after the *dealers* and ignore the small buyers, and this is true even of stings on college campuses. When I read about DEA drug busts, even huge ones, the focus is on the dealers - which on SR, would be the sellers.

The known quantum attack on SHA-256 is a variant of Grover's algorithm, which apparently is better described as inverting a function than searching a list. Its effect is to lop off half the bits of SHA-256 (O(n^0.5)), making it more like SHA-128. I can dig up the link if you want.

A very good point. Personally, if I were in debt, I'd take some of my gains - if not all of them - off the table now and erase some of that debt. To not do otherwise is like holding a gold bar as you sink in quicksand. To avoid cashing in one's bitcoins and hold onto one's debt is the same thing as leveraging oneself - going into debt to buy bitcoins. It's increasing both your upside and downside, and variance is something we usually try to *avoid*!
(At the very least, I'd do something like calculate at what price I would sell out of bitcoin to deal with my debt, and enter in an indefinite sell-at order, so if the price ever goes that high, I'd be free and clear.)

Listen, it's not that hard.
1. Look for the reference class of digital currencies, adjust Bitcoin's probability of success according to its novel properties which make it better or worse than those other (usually failed) currencies; and figure out whether the expected value of investing is positive or negative.
2. If it's negative, you're done; if it's positive:
3. then figure out at what point you no longer care about wealth ('wealth is logarithmic in utility' as the saying goes) and invest only enough wealth in bitcoins that you reach that point in the event of a success.
If you invest any more money, time, or thought into bitcoin, have other reasons for it like entertainment.
@_date: 2011-06-04 16:03:55
Well, you get the satisfaction of being right (and I get a valuable lesson about my own competence in predicting bitcoin prices). I suppose we could also make a bet (if you'd give better than 1:5 odds, otherwise I obviously have no reason to take a bet), but I don't know of any prediction markets in bitcoin yet, and I don't trust you enough to simply agree on a bet.
If you really wanted to get something if you're right, you could find an acceptable third-party to serve as escrow, like noagendamarket. (I trust him since I got most of my bitcoin from his Witcoin, and if he wanted to screw me over...). The wager could be something like 'bitcoin will cost more than $100 at any point between now and midnight 30 June'; if I'm right, I get 1 btc, if you're right, you get, say, 4.5 btc.

That's what I mean - we don't know what kind of SHA processing this ASIC is specialized for.

The reference was to having short/weak passwords with hashes that could be cracked in the event of a cracker or law enforcement penetration. Not so much the reuse at other sites issue but impersonation or other issues on SR. I'm not imaginative enough to think of how you could screw over someone with their password (aside from obvious things like stealing their balance), but I'm sure it can be done. So, best to have a very long password.


The Feds can do that for bitcoins in general and it would be as justifiable. (It wouldn't be hard to 'contaminate' most bitcoins in circulation under that sort of attack. So much has gone through mt.gox that probably most bitcoins in circulation *are* contaminated under that definition.) As well, this is an issue for the sellers, isn't it?

Only if you value the money going to the charity as much as your own money. You don't win anything on Long Bets but reputation and seeing the other guy's money going, as well as your own, to your favored charity.
That's how Long Bets is permitted to operate in the US! Otherwise it's a prediction market or betting site, both strictly banned in the US.
EDIT: I should say mostly banned. There are loopholes; for example, IEM is permitted to operate as long as it keeps 'small' - not allowing any accounts over $500 or something like that.

It's harder for a customer to undo a bitcoin transaction with 1 confirmation (worst case delay: ~10 minutes?) than to undo a credit card with a chargeback (worse case delay: months?).

What good is a 'distributed' cryptocurrency (that one expects to come under sophisticated technical &amp; legal assault), which has such a single-point-of-failure trusted party?
The right answer is that they are not a single-point-of-failure because the official client *cannot* ram through any change the developers (or whomever controls them) please and any major client/protocol change would require widespread community and the GPU miners' assent. Which brings us right back to the lack of any technical solution to upgrading hashes!
You see the dilemma? Either some central point like the client has enough power to force a hash upgrade, which means it has enough power to screw everyone over, or no point has such power in which case there are no technical ways to upgrade and only messy undefined insecure social mechanisms.

It's a question of risk. Who do you trust more, the exchange or your own computer's security? (Remember the spasm of paranoia and fear the other day about mt.gox shuffling 400k btc around?)
In this case, the guy thought his own security was better and wasn't in too much of a hurry to upgrade his security (as he says he was planning to get around to eventually). Apparently he was wrong.

My point was that there's no need for the developers of a software to worry about liability for what the users might do with it.

Hah. No, what actually happened was that I finished it late at night, tarred up the Markdown article and all the images, and emailed it to kiba, who got it in the morning and then thought better of it. He has sort of changed his mind a little since, but the cat's out of the bag.
kiba *did* pay me the 1btc we had agreed upon lo those many weeks ago, but since then I have received exactly [0.1btc in donations]( to my donation address. (The gratitude of Bitcoiners!)

My own summary (for use in [Bitcoin is Worse is Better](
'Security expert Dan Kaminsky is similarly appalled at the bandwidth requirements to scale (":0" was his emoticon) and predicts that the Bitcoin network will eventually turn into a quasi-bank-like oligarchy of supernodes (which changes the system and "offers a host of ugly semantics" since the supernodes "don't need 50% -- just need to inconvenience 50% to accept your opinion"). He [comments]( that while "Normal Code" seems good but "Scratch the surface, it's actually really bad", the Bitcoin codebase "Looks really bad up front" and "Scratch the surface, it's actually surprisingly good". On a technical basis, he dislikes the use of SHA-256 as opposed to slower time-lock crypto functions like bcrypt, because SHA-256 "can be accelerated massively with GPUs" leading to GPU shortages and massive hashing disparities between peers, and his slides conclude "BitCoin is actually well designed, if you accept that anonymity and scaling forces the entire present model to be shifted into something that effectively looks like banking"'

As I said the first time, it's impossible in principle to prove it. But how is it *in practice*?
@_date: 2011-06-03 00:57:02
I wouldn't; the article isn't on the technical underpinning of Bitcoin but on its practical use. As it is, your sentence is a tissue of half-truths that badly oversells Bitcoin's cryptographic security:
1. SHA-256 is not a cipher
2. There is [no built-in way]( to upgrade the hash; the expectation is that the community will voluntarily switch over somehow to a new blockchain using a better hash
3. [quantum attacks]( on SHA-256 are already known
4. No cryptographer thinks SHA-256 will last forever
5. Indeed, it is often not known whether hashes can be secure; many are based on the [assumption]( that a certain math problem is not in P. (SHA-256 is not even this secure.)
6. Comparing AES-128 to SHA-256 is apples and oranges. Their security cannot be compared since they don't do the same things. (If anything, AES-128 is likely to long outlive SHA-256.)

I haven't heard any, but it's hard to see what other reason it could be. It makes no sense from most points of view.

You are not going to convince me or anyone else with an argument like that.


Oh good grief. Now you are pointing to a *comment* to continue your reading into things?


I see you missed the entire comment where I discuss how sellers bear little risk and it is the buyers that are vulnerable.


What makes you so sure I'm a Bitcoiner? It's interesting but that doesn't mean I have bought into the project and all its ideals.
Would you be congratulating me if this article turned out to help Bitcoin by discussing and documenting a demand driver and important test-case? I suspect you wouldn't, in part because there's no way to prove that this either hurt or help Bitcoin.
And if this did hurt Bitcoin even to the extent that it would be worth devoting one neuron to thinking about it, I would publish *anyway* because that would mean that *the Bitcoin experiment has failed and needs to be terminated immediately*. Good game, chaps, let's all meet back here when the next Satoshi figures out how to patch the vulnerabilities.

Thor is an even more ignorant blowhard than Wright. (Remember: [reversed stupidity is not intelligence]( Just because you don't understand what [survival analysis]( or a [survival curve]( is, doesn't mean it doesn't apply. A [nonparametric]( method deals fine with things with complicated distributions such as time-to-failures due to competing risks. Survival analysis is applied fruitfully all throughout medicine, which is far more complicated than security, and has in fact been applied to computer security: you may remember a useful application of it to [Bitcoin exchange lifetimes]( "Beware the middleman: Empirical analysis of Bitcoin-exchange risk")  (and by the way, note how that one example satisfies many of the supposed 'counterexamples' Thor lists like insider attacks. Because Thor didn't understand what Wright was talking about in the first place) and I find it highly enlightening in understanding [darknet market lifetimes]( [how often Google shuts down services]( and many other things.
Thor's analysis, on the other hand, is like reading about a medical trial and going 'but, like, people are different, how can you reduce *that* to numbers?! My uncle smoked his whole life and died in a car accident. So these doctors are full of it.' (But funnily enough, it does in fact work.)
Some further reading: 
A *real* critique of Wright's application of survival analysis would be something like this: the survival curve cannot be cleanly approximated by a parametric curve (IIRC, it goes something like a Type I + Type III curve but not exactly), so you're forced to use the nonparametric methods which come with a lot of downsides to pay for their universality; besides being harder to work with or make predictions with, nonparametric methods require lots of data which is typically not reported in an unbiased fashion, allowing only the simplest inferences with very wide confidence intervals (for example, his Windows vs Linux time-to-compromise experiment\* is adequately powered because he was only looking at one binary variable, OS, but anything more than that and it'd be noninformative); other survival security analyses show that the Internet security environment does not respect the proportional hazards risk assumption, so it may be unsafe to throw in a lot of covariates into a Cox regression to try to build a comprehensive model of security to optimize; and Internet security risk definitely is time-varying (think about Microsoft's Patch Tuesdays), so you need to do something like the 'crazy clock' method to incorporate that. So basically: the method works, but he didn't check for some common ways in which it can go wrong, and I am skeptical that it would work fast enough to deliver useful answers before the terrain has changed yet again (cancer doesn't evolve as fast as Internet vulnerabilities). But not anything to do with 'insiders' or being a blowhard. On a more meta level of critique: while Thor is a moron, Wright is also guilty (as usual) of communicating poorly his ideas; and Wright comes off as a bit naive in his understanding of survival analysis and not appreciative of its limits (a lot like Bitcoiners trying to explain Bitcoin to laymen, actually, and getting about the same reactions too).
One might be amused to know that when I read through all Wright's email exchanges back in December, including this one, I took it as evidence for being Satoshi rather than !Satoshi: if I routinely got this sort of not even wrong reactions to my work, I'd be pretty cynical and self-righteous too. _Baka bakka_.
\* I am assuming here that he performed the experiment as he wrote it up on his blog; even if he didn't, the methodology &amp; analysis looked reasonable to me and the results as expected

That wasn't an endorsement. We were seriously disturbed by the blog editing stuff I turned up while investigating Wright. I still stand by what we wrote: either Wright is Satoshi, or he has been engaged in a mammoth multi-year scam in which his dedication to fooling the ATO has included forging dozens of documents, investigating the most minute aspects of what is known about Satoshi such as his interest in online gambling, adding and then removing subtle references to him being Satoshi on his blog (including one blog post using _Dune_ &amp; _Dune Messiah_ allusions I haven't seen anyone else point out yet), etc. Either way, it's a fascinating story worth reporting on, and I'm munching popcorn the entire time to see how it falls out and what the answers to all the mysteries turn out to be.
I hope that the _London Review of Books_ profile still comes out, since I bet that would shine a lot of light on matters. For example, who, if anyone, is financially involved with Wright? One of the leading theories is that Grigg et al are financially dependent on Wright now and have deluded themselves, but as far as I know, no one has yet to admit that they have actually given any money to Wright in any way.

SR3 is nothing but a random DNM which decided to rebrand itself 'Silk Road' after starting as 'Diabolus'. It does nothing particularly well, its 'Crypto Market' side has had information leaks, it is not large, and it is not particularly old. It is merely one of [70+ DNMs]( which have sprung up after SR1's demise and have been operating continuously since October 2013. There is no reason to care about it.

@_date: 2016-05-19 17:03:06
I think *a* distributed DNM can be done with, say, pure Bitcoin+Tor+Namecoin. But again, look at my breakdown: Bitcoin only solves one part of the puzzle, payments. It has no way to store transaction histories, reputation scores are tricky (proof-of-burn is easy but how do you track who burned how much?), no way to send messages, no anonymity mechanisms...
To build a whole distributed DNM, you need additional puzzle pieces like i2p or a second blockchain for tracking all transaction history, reputation etc, and correspondence between buyer &amp; seller (although that might be better done out of band in something like Bitmessage). So you can come up with a variety of designs: a specialized sidechain, use of Bitcoin but finessing history/reputation with 2-of-2 Nash exchange, a full altcoin, an Ethereum smart contract, not trying to solve some problems &amp; hoping that works out, Tor/i2p for anonymity underneath the pseudonymous transactions etc. So if you didn't want the more complex alternatives, about the simplest possible distributed DNM would be (along the lines of P2Pox): Bitcoin with 2-of-2, Tor for anonymous connections, and Namecoin for storing pseudonyms/offerings; you connect with Tor to Namecoin to look up available offerings, then enter into a 2-of-2 Nash transaction (which simplifies matter a great deal, since you don't need Sybil-proof reputation/feedback because it's self-enforcing &amp; the Nash equilibrium is honest exchanges).


Transaction-level anonymity. With most of the other possible proposals, you would be able to see exactly how many transactions for how much where done when by each buyer and seller. This is problematic: it helps de-anonymization a lot and can hurt a seller a great deal when caught. Zero-knowledge proofs let a distributed DNM provide verifiable information about just the number of transactions and burnt amount but none of the other dangerous details. Very nice, but IMO, not essential.


Easy to implement complicated stuff on without writing your own whole altcoin.


Not sure. How do you see that working?

I did look into stylometry a fair bit, but I became discouraged by how easy it is to fool yourself with stylometry and by the closed-world assumption it tends to require - my working assumption all along had been that there's a good chance the real Satoshi is not even in the list of usual suspects, in which case stylometry is useless.

BMR, like SR1, moved .onions once or twice. I believe `r6...4.onion` is the final BMR address, so earlier screenshots or sources might disagree; I think they also had a vendor-specific onion like many DNMs.
Anyway, the Silk Road Reloaded on I2P is a different site still, which has nothing to do with either SR1/SR2\*/BMR or Diabolus/SR3. I'm surprised it's still around, since its use of I2P guaranteed it would have trouble finding any customers and its operator is exceedingly prickly. Anyway, when I was still a mod of we banned both Diabolus and SRR from being linked/discussed, precisely because we despised their leeching off the SR brand and confusing newbies and outsiders (which they certainly did, as both you and the OP demonstrate).
\* Not that I was ever too pleased about SR2. They had a legitimate claim to the brand since they did bring over many of the surviving staffers, but that itself was a serious problem! We *knew* there was a mole somewhere in SR1 because LE had said so within days of Ulbricht's arrest! and then as if that wasn't bad enough, it turned out Ulbricht had dox of most of the SR1 staff on his laptop. Using SR2 was idiotic to begin with, super-idiotic after the December arrests, and mind-bogglingly idiotic after they turned off escrow... So this was the dilemma anyone claiming to be 'Silk Road _n_' faces: if you were genuinely connected to SR1, you were instantly compromised by LE, and if you weren't connected, you were a shameless leech trying to scam newbies with unearned reputation.

Nobody cares or even thinks about this as an issue. I think that in the last 2 years of multisig use, this may well be the first time I've heard this brought up by anyone as a concern - and certainly it has nothing to do with why the actual black-market users don't use multisig.


Also bogus. It's more likely that either the recent rash of Evolution vendor busts (fnufnu, Shiney-Flakes, some others) prompted the fear or that Kimble &amp; Verto reached some sort of saturation point - wealth has diminishing returns, and at some point another $100k doesn't make much of a difference. (On top of that, it's easier to cash out small amounts than large amount.)
Ulbricht is unlikely to have had anything to do with it, especially since Ulbricht being busted is *why* they started Evolution, to fill the lucrative niche that SR1 proved existed.


If this strategy worked and centralized-escrow markets started having lifetimes measured in weeks due to paranoia, all it would do is force people to actually use multisig. Some people would find it too difficult and inconvenient, but the rest would manage without too much of a problem. The marginal change would be minimal.

That seems *really* unlikely.

Farrell is OK. He's not correct on all points (his paper, for example, had some errors) and he wants to force all black-market events into his particular framework (eg he insists in his earlier piece that Ulbricht hiring hitmen proves DNMs necessarily require coercion, despite that having more to do with Ulbricht's hubris and gullibility and other blackmarkets thus far finding hitmen unnecessary despite being as large or larger), so I don't get much out of reading him.

I dunno, the only way I can see this as going _keikaku doori_ is if the goal is to make Wright look irrefutably to the entire world a massive con artist who should be in jail now, having burned all his bridges in the Bitcoin community and defrauded everyone who believed and trusted in him. And the only reason I can think of where this would be the goal is if he was Satoshi but was *so* desperate to keep his privacy that this was the only strategy he could think of to end the questioning once and for all.
Except that's stupid since if he just wanted his privacy back and to be forgotten, he was *already* winning before he pulled all these stunts! I keep a Google Alerts and some other things going, and Wright had basically been forgotten by March, with the general media and pundit opinion being that he looked plausible but the supercomputer and degree stuff indicated he was probably a scammer and of no future interest. Then he went and pulled his 'I'm going to prove it, wait, I changed my mind' thing... Now in all his future interactions with everyone, he's not 'obscure guy who, oh yeah, might be Satoshi and has some tax problems' but 'proven evil con artist no person in their right mind will give the time of day to'. Plus now he has to worry about even more questioning as people become interested in how exactly he pulled off his crimes and who he ripped off for how muhc.

What this is, is a hatchet-job for a bunch of SV people settling scores with Ripple/Stellar/McCaleb/Kim (note in particular the author's over-the-top praise of McCaleb's ex, MiSoon Burzlaff, who probably provided a lot of the personal material and contacts, and the bizarre logical contortions he goes through to criticize Stellar but not Ripple).
Which is ugly, but at the same time as long as you keep the bias &amp; hit-job aspect in mind, you can still learn a lot about what was going on over the past few years in that little backwater of cryptocurrencies - at least, I hadn't seen a lot of this stuff on the record before.

I don't think he's claiming novelty about the idea that 'you can speed up a lot of calculations by using approximations and accepting errors!' Beyond 3D or 2D graphics, there's a whole field of analogue computing which can be much more efficient because of that, many optimization problems use that basic idea, the 'end to end principle' expresses the idea of fast error-prone computations with a final slow accurate check for error (or you could call his fast-slow Bitcoin mining a [Las Vegas algorithm](

You never know what connections he may have. Perhaps a relative or protege or friend was burned. He's not necessarily going to *tell* you about his conflicts of interest.


That's part of it, yes. There can be a lot of people with an interest in hitting at them: the sources all have their own agendas, the publisher or backer may have another agenda, and the author may have a third agenda. It can be difficult to figure out exactly what is going on behind the scenes if actors don't tip their hand (the Burzlaff bit is something where by going overboard on the praise, it flags her as a major source who is using the author, and then it's easy to figure out her agenda); this is why a reputation for objectivity and thoroughness is valuable - now I know if I see any other articles by this author that they must be examined critically because he either has an agenda of his own or is easily manipulated by others.

At a year regular sellers would be unhappy about that sort of delay; most of them do not seem to run tight financial ships or have considerable working capital. Even so, most people tend to have personal discount rates around 5-10%, so coins being locked up that long isn't a big deal. It might increase capital requirements upfront to set up a decent sized scam since you can't roll proceeds back in quickly, but that's what loans are for.

Yeah. He has basically an unbroken publication history in general; in 2008, when Bitcoin first came out he: released several papers (a quick count of author/coauthor suggests *19* papers), two PhD students of his finished their dissertations &amp; one he 'worked closely with', was named an ACM Fellow, lectured in California and Italy and Detroit, was still editor-in-chief of an ACM journal and a member of an editorial board for another journal, worked on 7 conferences' committees, worked in 2 government programs for IARPA and the Department of Commerce. And presumably he had to teach sometime during all this, and have some sort of personal life. And oh yes, he moved from CMU to University of North Carolina the year before, so all this was in a new setting and job!

No. They picked up the 30k something coins from the Silk Road servers: this represented funds deposited on SR at that day, in the process of being used to buy drugs, before the relevant seller withdrew their bitcoins, plus SR's commissions. (Ross seems to have withdrawn his cut only sporadically, on the order of every 100 days or so.) Sometimes people left money on SR for no good reason. One person I know on IRC left 20 bitcoins on SR for half a year and didn't realize what she'd done until a month after the SR bust. Oops.
But *after* they stole everything on the servers, they somehow managed to pick up another 110k from Ross's seized hard drives and laptop. How? They haven't said.

The consensus on is that as long as you hadn't paid any fees (and SR didn't charge anything to deposit or withdraw, which is one reason it was so useful for laundering bitcoins even for people who had no interest in drugs), you should be free and clear.

- Wei Dai: I believe OP is simply wrong there
- Reiter: OP singled out Reiter... why? The Byzantine general literature is huge, there are hundreds of contributors to it. Someone who writes like an American and is male... why, that sounds like almost everyone in cryptography. Not a whole lot of chicks there!
- LinkedIn seems like a pure red herring: I have trouble believing that he could possibly be that incompetent.
- Satoshi went to the Cryptography mailing list for a critique. Why would he do that if he had never used it before? Yet, Reiter appears to have never contributed to the ML - the only hits are some citations.
- Satoshi, besides writing in English, is apparently a skilled experience C++ programmer; Bitcoin, ugly as the code has been called, is very far from a Hello World or 'My First C++ Program'. Reiter doesn't have any source code or libraries linked on his site, so I can't tell. I looked at 6 or 7 of the more recent papers, and they either used C++, C, or I couldn't tell. (On the other hand, C and C++ are so dominant in crypto, and were dominant in general when Reiter was growing up and getting his degrees, so this tells us less than it looks unless we can directly compare the Bitcoin source code with Reiter source code.)

To be fair, doesn't that apply just as well to Ripple? Just like Satoshi didn't dump his &lt;1m, they would not want to dump and would want to only gradually cash out (possibly doing so by taming volatility).

I have received invaluable information in the past from people I had to teach a bit of PGP to. You may find this surprising, but nevertheless, it's true. (One of them has been valuable enough to me that they alone pay for all my efforts in teaching a bit of PGP to people.)


No. I don't. Your misspelling of what I wrote aside, it is a technical term referring to [game theory]( and [decision theory]( where the specific reasoning I used, [backward induction]( is a very common form of argument.

Well, as I said: I sometimes write about Bitcoin history, Satoshi, and a lot about black-markets. For whatever reason, some people decide I may be Satoshi. This is stupid since I fail basic requirements for being Satoshi like I don't know any C++, but nevertheless, it happens.

In the long run, we'll all be dead. It's really silly to worry about 100s or 1000s of years - modern cryptography isn't even 100 years old, there's no way Bitcoin will survive 100 years. It'll be replaced before then.

I doubt that anyone informed said such a thing. Everyone knew custom ASICs were the pinnacle, the question was whether the money would ever be there to justify making them, which was never certain (in fact, if you knew that, that was tantamount to knowing that Bitcoin would become very successful since nothing but a large Bitcoin economy could justify putting up all the capital for ASICs, and so you could have profited massively by just loading up on bitcoins when they were pennies a piece).
@_date: 2013-10-08 21:43:55
Of course they were going to try, but it's not obvious that these arrests are related. One of the British arrests, Plutopete, runs a legal business and could have been arrested at anytime since he made no secret of his SR work; the 2 Swedish arrests (they were a vendor together), went quiet, according to their buyers, a week or so before SR went down; and the indictment/complaint of NOD (the Washington State guy) started many months ago based on mail seizures &amp; a controlled delivery &amp; tracking devices.

Silk Road takes a pretty hefty percentage, the initial seller fee is not necessary trivial, and Tor balks a lot of people. 
It's possible that for much less illicit drug-selling, like online pharmacy standbys modafinil or Viagra, the security and escrow and reputational features of SR are simply not worth the costs; or that they think they can safely operate on the regular web, so forcing Tor on users leads to a loss of lots of potential customers with no benefit. In fact, either seems quite likely since the online pharmacies were operating on the regular web with credit card companies &amp; Paypal for years and years.

Yes; the paper finds that in order of importance, the predictors of shutting down were:
1. having been hacked
2. having higher daily volume (maybe a quarter as important as being hacked)
(They also checked for anti-money-laundering regulation burden, but that was trivially small and not worth mentioning.)

No. You've seen me discuss candidates for Satoshi, you've seen me discuss their strong and weak points, you've seen me change my mind, you've seen me discuss why popular candidates don't work or why widely-read analyses are fatally flawed.
You have never seen me say 'X is Satoshi' on IRC or anywhere else, much less in public on the WWW like on Reddit, and you never will until the unlikely scenario where I decide I have reached at least &gt;50% confidence (which I don't ever expect to reach because Satoshi has done a pretty good job).


What has been irresponsible about my behavior? Have I posted my notes publicly? Have I spoken at length except to defend people *against* being Satoshi? Whom have I harmed? My best results I have never described even in IRC because I actually do have a sense of responsibility.


In discovering who Satoshi is, obviously. And suspect? Well, quite aside from its intellectual interest, it is a finding which would help bring stability to the Bitcoin economy and emphasize to the whole world that privacy is really important because anonymity is highly limited &amp; breakable for even the most competent and motivated person. (Particularly relevant during the current NSA scandal.)


Whom have I ever falsely accused?

Why would it include them at all? No one doing bot trading is going to be shuffling around bitcoins on the blockchain: the point of bot trading is doing a lot of extremely fast relatively small trades. Doing this on the blockchain would be extremely slow (15+ minutes compared to seconds or less) and expensive (each transaction would have to pay a fee, or be even slower).
A real bot trader will transfer some bitcoins to, say, MtGox, and do all the transactions on-MtGox. Maybe cash out winnings every week or something. Hence, hardly affecting Bitcoin blockchain transaction volume.

There are actually circumstances under which lotteries can become +EV (sometimes involving mistakes or jackpots rolling over), and in those circumstances it is still irrational to bet because when you plug it into something like the Kelly criterion or include some risk aversion, the odds are too low to make the risk of gambler's ruin worthwhile. This is why those +EV lottery circumstances are typically only exploited by syndicates of wealthy investors (or mafia) who can afford to buy as many tickets as it takes to win.

This is why the Jed McCaleb theory works so nicely with the WHOIS data: it explains how and why Satoshi was able to pay DigiRock (McCaleb was in Japan), but also why he seemed to be in other timezones than Japan according to his commits/emails/forum-posts/PDF - he was traveling or back home or something.


I don't really follow. If he avoided paying with a de-anonymizing method by using cash or a prepaid card, then as long as he connected through Tor (as we know he was using for all his other Bitcoin-related work), there was nothing to worry about and he didn't need to upgrade to Anonymousspeech hosting. It's the upgrade that is really suspicious.


Bitcoin.org was just a bunch of static pages. You can go back and look: 
2 static HTML pages, a PDF, a public key, and 2 screenshots. Not something that needs a lot of updating.

Your condescension would be amusing if you knew what you were talking about (or could spell).
What do 'throttles' and 'caps' have to do with port-blocking or breaking encryption? *Nothing*. If they cap your bandwidth consumption to 100GB a month, *you only get 100GB a month* no matter how many VPNs you tunnel through. If they throttle you to 50kb/s, *you only get 50kb/s* no matter how much encryption you add on.
And if you need 200GB a month to keep up with a global economy-sized blockchain, or you need 100kb/s to keep up with transactions - then you're screwed.

Look at it as an issue of competing theories of Bitcoin. This is roughly how I see the issues: the same observation can be consistent with multiple theories at once.
Suppose Bitcoin were completely flat over the past year; that would be evidence both against it being a bubble (obviously) *and* also against the theory that it was interesting or useful or valuable (because then why is no one interested in holding bitcoins?). In this case, as we kept observing flatness, we'd become increasingly convinced that there will be no sudden drop to 0 (because it's not a bubble) but also increasingly convinced that it will not reach a huge global market cap which makes every coin worth $1m or whatever. So even if our estimate of the future average price does not budge, we'd still be changing our estimates of how spread out future prices may be - shrinking the standard deviation or whatever. There's no reason to buy into Bitcoin or short it in this scenario, since both sides are symmetrical.
Now suppose the price is increasing dramatically. Its keeping going up is consistent with two different theories: that this is part of a bubble (obviously), and that Bitcoin is a fantastically useful desirable currency/technology/P2P-network which the general population (rather than some niche geeks) is simply starting to realize the advantages of with additional growth coming from network effects &amp; positive externalities &amp; basic exponential growth stuff like any startup.
In this case, our beliefs will look different than before. We might leave our estimate of the mean price the same, but this time increase substantially our estimate of how distant the price will turn out to be from the current price. This is what people are getting at with the asymmetry observation: if you don't know if Bitcoin is going to go up or down, because the increase is consistent with both theories, there's still an asymetry because if it goes to zero you just lose your investment, the possible negative futures are all truncated at zero but the positive futures do not get lopped off at $10k or something. (This is also why shorting is sheer madness at this point, even if you are convinced Bitcoin will go to 0.)
To conclude that you should avoid Bitcoin *because* of the increase, you need to either be highly skeptical in general of Bitcoin (in which case you're not buying in the first place), or believe that these increases are better evidence for bubble than legitimate revolutionary breakthrough.

This is statistically illegitimate. You can't do stylometrics this way!
He has not validated his approach on any dataset at all, much less his own dataset (using something like bootstrap/crossvalidation/holdout). His claims about p-values misunderstand what p-values are. He does not specify what set he's testing phrases on. He does not specify its size and hence the base rate of each candidate. He seem to think the phrases are uncorrelated, which is obviously false. His Satoshi corpus seems to be tiny, restricted to the whitepaper, without regard to the Bitcointalk posts or Satoshi's many emails (_p_&lt;0.0008 using just the whitepaper? Give me a break!). He does not give the rankings for other candidates. Stylometrics depends on a closed-universe assumption he has not come close to justifying making. Heck, normal stylometrics does not focus on unusual phrases but subtler aspects of normal speech (eg throw out everything but the 1000 most common words, words like 'and' or 'or' or 'but')!
No stylometrics research would do things the way he seems to have done things, because it guarantees error.
And that's before getting to the problems with his understanding of Satoshi:
- Satoshi did *not* cite Wei Dai. Adam contacted Satoshi and told him about Wei Dai's work and only then did Satoshi add the citation to Dai in the whitepaper. This renders his point about not citing Szabo a little less interesting.
- Szabo freely said he invented bit gold in 1998, on the same blog that he's being accused of having 'retroactively post-dated' discussion of bit gold
- Szabo does not blog very much at all, so his early silence on Bitcoin is not terribly surprising. Most early reaction to Bitcoin was neutral or negative and it was very very far from obvious it would go anywhere.
- Szabo does not seem to participate in the same fora that Satoshi publicized Bitcoin
Now, Szabo has always been a candidate for Satoshi, for good reason. But not for the reasons he claims. This dude needs to be much clearer about how his analysis works, take seriously statistical issues like overfitting and multiple comparison, update his claims about Szabo's actions, and so on before I can take his results seriously.

Not necessarily. The interesting thing about the `bitcoin.org` hosting is that the first host was DigiRock, as I said, which takes only yen, works only in Japanese, and has zero anonymity or privacy protection and is your standard dirt-cheap VPS host, offering VPS for like $21 a year. Satoshi signed up for AnonymousSpeech as his registrar, which is a company fanatical about security and anonymity which allows crazy payment methods like cash mailed to Switzerland, so his WHOIS didn't give anything away.
OK, interesting, but so what? Why am I talking about DigiRock and AnonymousSpeech. Well, the interesting part comes in 2009 or so: Satoshi switched from DigiRock to AnonymousSpeech for *hosting* as well. AnonymousSpeech offers equally fanatical bulletproof hosting as well as registar services - but instead of the VPS costing $21 per year, now it was costing Satoshi closer to $50. Per month. He wound up spending something like $720 on AnonymousSpeech hosting for what was basically some static promotional pages (since development was on SourceForge); and the registrar/domain cost him another $216. So he spent almost a thousand bucks over 2-3 years.
(To put this in perspective, my own website [gwern.net]( hosts hundreds of pages, hundreds of megabytes of PDFs &amp; data &amp; images, has received something like 4 million pageviews since ~2009, and I have spent a grand total of $383 on hosting &amp; storage &amp; domain name.)
If Satoshi had successfully paid for his DigiRock hosting in a completely anonymous way and is actually a British programmer or whatever, why did he feel the need to pay almost $1k to upgrade his hosting to 'anonymous' hosting? He was already anonymous... *unless*, that is, he had de-anonymized himself while paying DigiRock and realized his vulnerability.
The way I read this: Satoshi was a dude who in 2008 had finished most of his work on a neat idea which he'd written up into a whitepaper, but he wanted to keep anonymous, so he took the basic easy precautions of using Tor and hiding his WHOIS data. He didn't need serious heavyduty hosting like AnonymousSpeech so he didn't pay their frankly enormous hosting fees. He went with a cheap low-quality Japanese VPS service, because he was Japanese and that was easiest to pay with. (He could hardly pay with Bitcoin, could he?) But by 2009, he was starting to get a little worried since his 'Bitcoin' project was actually getting some traction and looked like it might not be another failed or abandoned project like Finney's RPOW, and so he seriously upgraded his hosting to avoid an easy attack.
However, anonymity, once lost, can never be regained. This is why I say that if the US government ever *really* wanted to find Satoshi Nakamoto, they could probably find him just by attacking DigiRock and finding out who paid for `bitcoin.org` hosting in August 2008.

Probably, yes. That doesn't exclude what I said. Bitcoin could've been built by a team, and all public messages handled by the project leader or lead programmer.
(One approach towards examining this would be to try looking at the source code revision history. Does it look like an individual programmer wrote it from the first file, or does it look like a giant project got imported fully formed and then subsequently tinkered with by one programmer? Can the commits be linked with public email or bugtracker or forum posts? Do the commits include any natural language which can be confirmed to be the same voice as the public posts/emails/papers? If the public stuff was confirmed to be by the same person who did the source code, this doesn't rule out *all* team approaches: there could be a conceptual designer, Satoshi-public be the main programmer and publicist, and an arbitrarily large team of security reviewers or tests. But the more unity we observe, the fewer possible teams there are.)

Even using Christin's old numbers from 2012, the sum total of the arrests is still under 1% of active sellers, despite this being the worst-case scenario where the majority of users did not use PGP, DPR was caught with his computer unencrypted, and the server seized without issue. This is not hugely risky, and probably much better than selling on the street. Most of the vendors are shrugging their shoulders, feeling irritated at losing whatever they had in escrow, and moving over to BMR or Sheep.

In what sense is this even half-wrong? Did the US economy take off at &gt;4% growth rates thanks to computers throughout the '90s and '00s? Does anyone here even know how useful fax machines were when they were introduced? Do they realize that in Japan, fax machine popularity peaked at around [*60% of all households* 2007-2012]( "In Japan, fax machines remain important because of language and culture") (where's your Internet now?). Are they aware of the long-standing debate over the [productivity paradox]( about how "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics"? Of Cowen's _Great Stagnation_, about Gordon's comparison with the toilet, of Autor's work on how technology is destroying the middle-class by hollowing out the economy? I realize everyone in thinks economists are brainwashed tools of the Great Satan who exist only to justify inflation and deficit spending, but I didn't realize that they were supposed to be so stupid that they couldn't spot large-scale effects.
Listen. The Internet is great. But that doesn't mean nothing has ever been as important as the Internet, that the Internet has delivered unparalleled economic growth, or that it is an unalloyed good which can do no wrong. (Even in purely economic terms, the gains of things like Craigslist are partially offset by things like the destruction of the newspaper industry.) If you spend 10 hours on Reddit a day, you would have done something else almost as fun if Reddit didn't exist! You know, people lived pretty happily before the Internet existed! I realize this will come as a shock, but just because people spend a ton of time on something doesn't mean it's delivering a ton of marginal value; it just means it's delivering slightly more value than the next-best alternative.

I think you're missing the most important thing here driving the exchange rate: the dog that did not bark - where are DPR's 600k bitcoins?
The  coins could have been seized successfully by the FBI the day Ulbricht was arrested with his laptop unlocked. But they weren't. And given that more than a week has passed with no whisper that the coins have been accessed, the markets are increasingly assuming that they won't be. There's a very big difference between the scenario where 600k bitcoins are going to be dumped on the market in a year, and where they aren't going to be spent for 2 decades if ever.

I mean pretty much exactly that. You're looking at it in [hindsight]( where Bitcoin seems like a brilliant idea destined to change the world and easily be worth $1 per bitcoin. The reaction of everyone else, however, is that Bitcoin is dubious, has some seriously questionable design choices, and may not be solving the right problems - yes, even the cryptographers interested in digital currency to whom Satoshi announced his invention [criticised it for at least 6 distinct]( issues and were skeptical of its security. (As they would be right to, inasmuch as Bitcoin *did* contain some serious security issues like a bug where you could spend anyone's coins.)
They didn't think it would succeed, or would succeed in its current incarnation, or that it was an extremely chancy affair (as it was and still is). They weren't 'destroying their fortune', they simply deleted some files they had no use for, which if they thought about it at all, held some play money. They had other things to do. And entropy took its toll.
So, coins got lost, or they cleaned up as they moved on to other things.
Or, you know, maybe all the early adopters were brilliantly prescient, foresaw everything that happened, weren't just dabbling with some curious new software, and have inhuman investing discipline as they break every rule of investing by remaining fully invested into Bitcoin and do not take their winnings as they sell on the peaks or diversify into other assets...

No, he wouldn't've. Estimate out how much 2 or 3 servers for 3 years would cost, and $2,000/week for the employees (conservative, because the FBI says that was the max). It comes to nowhere near 600k btc.


And most of SR was being pegged to the dollar.


It's an upper bound (probably), but even 300k is still a hell of a lot to sell into the market when there's only 11.8m bitcoins around and at least 1m of that has been lost or is held by Satoshi.

We are not talking about 'a market cap of over $8bil'. We are talking about a single exchange on Monday night with the already-deposited cash available to buyers to absorb the bitcoins he unloaded at that precise moment in time where buyers cannot move in cash immediately. Very different things.

Borrowing the [xkcd actuarial script]( and assuming Satoshi is as old as 30 (death rates going up with time past age 12, after all), and assuming he did not die before signing off in 2010, then there's probably &lt;1% chance he has died in the intervening ~3 (2013-2010) years:

The 'quantum annealing', which is what the D-Wave machines actually do, is a highly restricted sort of operation which can be done classically well and the D-Wave implementation of it may not even be quantum (this is why D-Wave has been controversial for so many years, it's not clear they're even making a 'quantum' computer, as opposed to an analogue computer). Shor's algorithm requires genuinely quantum effects, and would be able to speed up hash searches, hypothetically.


If you can't specify a remotely accurate timeframe, then you don't understand the issues.

That first hack, for a lot of people, was *why* they trusted Mtgox. I'm not sure if you remember what things were like at that time, but back then, the usual expectation was that a hacked site like a wallet or exchange would simply disappear, stonewall, return a tiny fraction of what was left, or otherwise completely screw over the users (and at least one, MyBitcoin, was probably simply the owners cashing out with a big payday). When Mtgox went down, people resigned themselves, others mocked them for ever entrusting bitcoins or money to a third party, still others predicted this would finally pop the Bitcoin bubble...
MtGox returned pretty much everyone's complete balance, did not drag out the process for years, and resumed operations.

Hm.

And 100% plausible. Selling before Ross is convicted makes things legally muddier (what happens if he's somehow acquitted? Do they give him the millions they sold the bitcoins for? Do they buy up millions of bitcoins to give the equivalent amount back to him?), and there's no reason for them to hold onto bitcoins post-trial.

Yes. Schmidt is a weird guy. On the one hand, he's a techie who did `lex` and goes to Burning Man and interviews Assange and asks for his privacy to be respected; and on the other hand, he's a insulated billionaire who cluelessly blurts out what we fear the big tech giants really want and he seems to have come to believe too.

That's why stenographers use special keyboards and notations.

The discussion of incentives and escrow in  may be helpful.

Really, because the time stamps I saw showed that I replied on Reddit an hour or so before your HN copy.


Please note the *vast* difference between your initial accusations of hypocrisy and claiming that I was specifically accusing people of definitely being Satoshi, and your new vague formulation. Well, certainly if one discusses how well particular persons fit, one is discussing 'theories of Satoshi', whatever that means...


The .1% estimate was based on actuarial estimates of mortality for males in the relevant age brackets, and I stand by it, as I do the additional evidence.


Note that Jack was not just accusing me privately, but threatening to go public, and also extorting me and intimating physical harm to Gavin Andresen and his family. Somehow, I fail to see the parallels.


Are you trying to argue that the Bitcoin economy is *more* stable the longer that Satoshi remains a complete and utter cipher of unknown wealth, intentions, and security? I would be fascinated to see a more elaborated explanation of why Satoshi's anonymity is actually a good thing for the Bitcoin economy.


It's possible to walk and chew bubble gum, and to desire more than one thing. It's great to get credit, and it's great to satisfy intellectual interest - but it's even greater to both satisfy intellectual interest and get some credit. Greater minds than myself, like Hooke and Newton, used anagrams to secure priority even as they satisfied their own curiosity. I don't see why you are so baffled.
And again, I note the lack of quotes from IRC showing how I am so totally hypocritical, self-centered, irresponsible, and a bad egg all around.

They got access to about a quarter of his estimated stash. They haven't released any details about how they did this, how much is left, or why they couldn't nail the rest; the FBI press release only mentions very generic 'forensics'. This could mean they broke a weak password on one of his wallets or they recovered a key from a deleted file or sector on the hard drive or a lot of things.

'doing nothing...unfortunate necessity'. I see.


Yeah, it's called 'I use dollars, not bullshit IOUs from everyone'.


Which they do, to the extent it's at all possible. How can Bitcoin be exchanged for fiat via Ripple that they cannot already be exchanged for fiat via not Ripple?

TheSelfGoverned was himself generalizing when he implicitly claimed that no actions were ever taken against torrenters. Actions are taken. People have trouble torrenting sometimes. This is relevant to a Bitcoin scaling discussion.


You can't get around caps and throttles with encryption! That's the point!

Almost true, in this case: remember that Bitcoin is not just a speculative instrument for zero-sum gambling, but enables a lot of transactions which might not have otherwise happened.
(Example: a few days ago a friend appealed for donations on my behalf (I didn't suggest it) and something like half the donations or ~$700 came in via bitcoins. I don't know exactly how many of those people would not have donated if Paypal was the only option, but I bet it was at least a few hundred dollars' worth.)

 should probably mention where you ship to.
