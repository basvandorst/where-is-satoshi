How about "mandatory" micro transactions. Technically, you don't have to pay, but EVERYTIME you open the app or click or do ANYTHING in it, a bouncing box ad pops up with a tiny X to close it that's never in the same spot. You can pay $5 to not see ads...for an hour. Not an hour of having the app open, but just a real life hour. But it's free! Micro transactions are totally optional*.

Where did you get this from?  I've seen a lot of shopped ones. It would be REALLY funny if this one is fake considering how many people have donated.

Combination of UASF tensions and U.S. Bill S.1241.

He heard it from me.

I would say it's largely because of the bill, definitely the catalyst. But I'm thinking the already existing tensions from UASF amplified the knee jerk reaction a little bit.
