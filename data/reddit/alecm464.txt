Is that all your intellect can come up with? No wonder you are confused about the difference between cure and treat.

Generally speaking. Yusus, you can't say anything these days without being ripped to pieces. All I was trying to do was portray the severity of the situation to allow others to understand that it is a good cause to donate in order to help others.
Can't even do that these days with people judging you all over the place. If everyone is so judgemental what's the point of social media to create awareness when no one wants to hear you or you get shot down every sentence you make?
I do not understand why people use social media as a weapon to destroy others. And it  is mainly used as a method to hide behind distant walls in order to hurt others (which shows how small you actually are as a person where you cannot do that in real life).

My wife has Crohns disease, an auto immune disorder where the body attacks itself throughout the entire digestive tract. It is non-curable, only treatment and management of the symptoms can be done. In 3rd world countries (like where we are) the cost of medicine in order to keep her in remission is outrageous and that is where a lot of our money goes to in order to keep her well. If there are charities or donations towards Crohns or auto immune diseases that can help to produce biologics and medicine to then sell at a lower price then that would be an amazing donation. 
Started investing any extra money into cryptocurrency to make gains so not worry about buying medicine again in the future for her, and also to go above that and try make enough money to purchase a house for us where we can  be close to a hospital for her. All proving very difficult with the expense of medicine though. 
Well done to you! :)

Thank you for the response. I will look into that. Much appreciated.

LOL. You obviously need a lesson in the English vocabulary. The term "cure" means that you no longer have the particular condition anymore, which means that is it completely gone. The term "treatment" means to manage the symptoms. So cannabis oils (like other medicines) help manage the symptoms of Crohns disease, but there is no cure. You not really intelligent for someone who assumes they are superior to others based on your skin colour. Clearly a lack of grey matter!

That's why I said donate to charity for auto immune diseases, not me. The point is that's its difficult when the only medicine to keep you healthy is more than half your monthly salary. So if research can be done to drop those costs then it can help a lot of people who are in the same boat . 
Can someone not relay their story without being criticized? Dick
