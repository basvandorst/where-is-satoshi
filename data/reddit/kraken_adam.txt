Hi, Tier 1-2 is mainly crypto in Kraken. We also do enable some Tier 2 clients to wire fiat dependent on geography. However, for the most part we require Tier 3 to transact in fiat and this comes with sufficient KYC. 
Of course the more KYC you have and the higher the Tier you are the more dollars you can transact. Each Tier has its limits.

I am sorry about that, typically that error message means the routing number entered is an ACH one. Can you please enter a wire transfer routing number instead. 
We only accept wires for USD.

Hi, 
Glidera sources its bitcoin prices from multiple exchanges USD/XBT trading pairs, including Kraken. The quoted price may have a ~0.5% premium compared to exchange prices depending on liquidity. You can see the exact exchange rate you will receive for any buy/sell transaction on the confirmation screen before initiating your transaction.
The limits for Glidera accounts are assigned once all information is entered.  Most accounts will receive a $1,000 daily and $5,000 monthly buy/sell limit.  Once requirements are met, you may have an option to increase those limits to $5,000 daily and $15,000 monthly.
Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:40:42
Hi, that is correct. For domestic USD transaction we only accept wires. It usually takes 1 to 5 business days to settle. This is the standard timeframe for wires. We do not control this fact. 
How much do you plan to deposit/withdraw in a month? If you simply want to buy some bitcoin (less than $5,000), we recommend that you check out Glidera (which will later become Kraken Direct):
If this options suits your needs, then please note that you would have to have one of the banks on this list:
Verification information is similar but should be faster, and if you have any problems, we can fast-track your on-boarding process, so that you can start buying bitcoin within a few days. Please note that even though you can only buy bitcoin on Glidera (future Kraken Direct), you can transfer the bitcoin to Kraken, and then you can trade the bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies with a Tier 2 verified account. Also, Glidera accepts ACH transfers, which are easier and cheaper than sending wires. If this sounds like a good option for you, please feel free to start the sign up process, and then let us know if you have any issues.

Hi, we are sorry for your experience. That sounds like an unfortunate set of circumstances to decide to not use us anymore. We take KYC and AML very serious and if we do not have all the documents to our liking we might push back. However, if it was just to rotate I do not think that should an issue. If you provide me a ticket number or want to open another ticket we can review your situation to get you back to being onboarded. 
We have recently have launched our new trading engine and have been experiencing record liquidity. Not to mention our fiat on and off ramps.
Thank you we look forward to gaining your trust back.
