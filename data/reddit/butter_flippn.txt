That's what I am worried about as well, essentially what I am trying to market is my expertise and your convenience.

I want to get into it because I have some money I've been saving but I am not sure if it would just be a huge miss.

This is a whole new industrial/business model. I will be taking 50% commission on anything less then an initial investment of $1000 and as price scales up I will be taking less and less commission until I get to 10%

Man you are a prophet, Right now I am tryna get a loan to buy bitcoin, it went up 100 today this is insane!!!

It's not really a doop, it's more like I'm introducing people who would have no idea about bitcoin to it and offering my aid and knowledge for about 20% commission. And I have some meetings tomorrow with some people that are very interested.

So like it would be a smart invest to buy as much as I can right now. Is that based off the current trend or do you think bitcoin is going to become even more mainstream which will drive its price up or both?
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:42:10
Do you think its going to go up much more? its already at 2g's?

I'm worried its gonna turn into a big bubble popping situation.
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:18:20
That's part of it, another thing that they will be getting is that I will be constantly monitoring the price so that like as little as possible can go wrong if we happen to see the pop in the next few weeks. I am predicting it will pop around 4.3 in mid july.

Like any brokerage people will give me the amount they wish to invest, I will then f buy bitcoin and transfer it to them or sell it for them (this would be for people who aren't super tech savy) or I would buy it and then sell out around the bubble pop. I will then take a commission on profits. I think bitcoin is gonna get to 4k by mid july if not sooner.

Ya thats what I was thinking, Like unless I got a major solar array, and a cheap way to cool tons of machines it would just be a hard to turn profit

Where do you buy it and then where do you sell it for return? I heard most of the companies that did this service either went under or got hacked.
