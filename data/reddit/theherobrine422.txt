It’s not too late but it’s very expensive, like 2 thousand dollars expensive, but mining altcoins like Monero, or Ether is not super expensive cause it can be mined with a normal computer graphics card which will only cost you a couple hundred dollars, and you could convert that to bitcoin, but ether and Monero have been making much bigger gains. Like Monero has went up around 4x in the past 3-4 months and Ether has went up a lot as well (I mine Monero so I have it’s price partially memorized.)

thats what I was gonna say.

we could ask how much it was to make it.

idk but that would probaly lower the fees but it still will be a good bit of fees, but if we use SegWit then it wont be too bad but still not good.

lol imagine a wall of paper wallets filled with a bit each

Technically yes but I wouldn't do Monero unless your gonna buy a mining rig cause even with 3 RX 480s you only get like a payout every month because of how high the network hash rate has become, I would probably do Aeon but any cryptonight coin you could technically do, but your not gonna get much with an old laptop (I estimate a dollar a week). To get anything really your probably gonna need to buy an RX 570 8gb, that would get around $1.5 a day more like $2 a day if you bios mod/oc the card but that's not including electricity.

wow, it seems like they don't like free speech based off that.

the problem is most places don't take take bitcoin and its almost impossible to get out of fiat, and only use bitcoin.

This is not specifically against Tesla Powerwalls, but batteries for solar panels in general so Tesla Powerwalls might not have these issues, I'm not sure.
Most batteries that can store enough power for overnight/off grid usage are expensive (thousands of dollars) and go bad within a period of 10-20 or fewer years and then need to be replaced and when you can simply be hooked up to the grid and get power during night for 5-10 dollars a month for a hook up fee (60-120 dollars a year or 300-600 every 5 years) and get the same usage, its just not worth it unless the apocalypse happens.
EDIT: I just checked, one powerwall is about 6 thousand dollars, I couldn't find an estimate of how long one would last (the warranty is 10 years so that's a number) but unless it lasts 50+ years, there is almost no chance that having one is cheaper then being hooked up to the grid, and that's not considering that I bet he would need at least 2-3 which would up it to around 15k so you can see how its just not worth it.
