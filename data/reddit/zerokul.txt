It's fucking awful. 2 of 4 transaction in the last week went unconfirmed, and for other transactions electrum keeps saying that mempool rejected my fees of $45. Yeah, no, this ride is broken af

I would have said something to oppose their negative views last week, but this week, my best bud is getting served by a gold digger thot who thought she could get half his shit after a 2.5 year fake marriage. Yeh, now I'm not so sure guys spending $%k on a piece of crap diamond is a good way to show affection

This is my first comment on any SN outing prior or ever: How is it that Bitcoin attracts this type of shit show on a regular basis?
This time, he literally got enough media involved to disseminate the *news* around the world, that even my local radio station mentioned it a couple of times.
I mean, could it be that being the first and out of the gate, Bitcoin didn't have a correct game plan for the growth and structure that it went through ? Could it be that given enough investment and interest, any community will attract snake oil salesmen ?
Do new ventures akin to Ethereum have an advantage over BTC as they can learn from others' mistakes ?
