How to do smart advertisement.

Very nice! Too bad most of us will still get fucked by regional pricing when using bitcoin. But still looking forward too! 
@_date: 2015-12-26 13:42:32
But isn't spending bitcoin a good thing? This currency can only keep it's value, if the people actually use it!

How would they know what Mac to unlock if they only have a single address? (assuming they do) I'd assume there's an address for every infected computer 
@_date: 2016-06-05 16:09:16
I use greenaddress because it's comfortable to access the same wallet on multiple computers and your smartphone. But I also don't hold a shitload of BTC.

Bitcoin is (are?) traded in a lot of exchanges all around the world and most are open 24/7 so the price will change all the time.

Well, I guess then I'd get a least one positive thing out of the elections :D 
@_date: 2016-12-15 11:10:37
But still a pretty useless response. I want my assistants to help me, not joke about what I want to do ��

While I appreciate your effort, I think it's better to link official pages listing their addresses instead of posting them here. Otherwise some dishonest users could just put up their own addresses.

Does this work everywhere or only with Amazon US? 
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:24:03
Thanks, thats a nice list. Im testing hive and bitgo right now!
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:25:13
I agree with Devam on this point. While core seems to be a very secure solution it's kinda unhandy for actual use. 
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:37:41
That's exactly my point!
If I have 1 BTC and both me and my friend buy a spaceship worth 1 BTC at the same time both transactions will pass if they don't use the same blockchain. We both get our spaceship and once the 2 chains try to synchronize one transaction has to be rejected. Whoever sold his ship in this TX will lose the Bitcoin.

What stops me from telling my buddy on earth my private key and ask him to spend all my Bitcoin at the exact same time? 
@_date: 2016-09-28 16:46:42


That describes me as well :)
It seems I misunderstood your concept of the "solar blockchain". When you don't have a shared balance, you obviously won't be able to perform this attack. So your systems will probably solve this!
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:20:08
I think you're talking about Amazon US. 
*EDIT: Sorry, I missed your second point:* I agree that Bitcoin, as it is right now, is not ready for so many users yet. But I also **don't** think we'd get to many users to handle, if Amazon (worldwide) offered the **option** to pay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:00:40
I don't think so. We really need more places for people to get and spent bitcoin. Here in Germany this is almost only possible for exchange sites and digital goods (like humble bundle)

Without knowing more about MasterPassword, I'd say with lastpass you can change your password. Not sure how you would do this with a deterministic password manager
@_date: 2016-05-02 13:31:21
But this would mean that he at least knew who Satoshi was
@_date: 2015-10-31 15:38:19
Where are you buying them? I'm in Germany an basically have to put my entire life documents in the hands of unknown people to even buy a little bit of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-05-09 14:14:43
Probably not Wreight. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 11:31:30
Hmm. Then you would need to keep track of the index number at which point you might as well use a "classic" password manager. 
Another point to consider: a lot of websites have ridiculous password requirements (min length, special characters, Max length (&lt;_&lt;)) - your generated password might not work. 
@_date: 2016-05-09 14:10:55
Nobody knows. 
The people who believe the price will rise, already bought. 
Those who believe the price will fall, already sold. 
If the halving affects the price at all, it already happened.

Why wouldn't he sign something with his name ("Craig is sathoshi") instead? 
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:10:56
Because people are willing to pay more for it.
