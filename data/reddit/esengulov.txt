If you can afford renting the house then do so and keep spending a fixed sum on BTC on a regular basis, regardless the price.  
That way you can spend part of your income on rent and another part on  buying BTC.
If things don't work out as you would like you will not really loose that much.

Making beautiful ICO website is an amateur task. Most these sites use free templates and can be set up in minutes. On the other hand, designing a well performing native user interface on iOS/Android is a different level. It's not easy, even for experienced developers.

In Simple Terms: Here is what happens on a technical level in regard to a 'randomly generated key' and '12 words'.
step 1 :When you first set up BRD wallet it generated a random number consisting of 128 binary digits  (either 0's or 1's) . It's called a 128 bit number
step 2:Another 4-bit number (consisting of 0's and 1's) digits added to the original 128 bit number. At this point the wallet has a 132 bit number. That 4-bit number is not random and actually derived via simple algorithm from the  randomly generated 128-bit number.
step 3:The resulting 132 bit number is then divided into 12 parts where each part is 11 bits (ex: 01010001001). As a result we have 12 such numbers, each consisting of 11 bits.
step 4:Each of these 12 binary 11-bit numbers is then converted to a decimal number (usual numbers we are used to :)). When you convert 11-bit numbers to a decimal number it would be somewhere 0 and 2047. So essentially we end up with 12 numbers where each corresponds to a a number between 0 and 2047.
step5:Wallet takes those 12 at this point decimal numbers, each ranging between 0 and 2047, and assigns a word to each number. The words are taken from a list of words that was documented in Bitcoin improvement proposal 32(BIP32). See here, [
So, at the end you get 12 words. Any standard-complaint wallet can take these words and process above steps backwards to derive the key from it. That usually happens when users are restoring wallet by inputting their words into some wallet app.
That's pretty much it. I didn't go into details in some steps but the whole steps looks as below. Most wallets should follow that standard.

If you don't need Bitcoin in your app then you can use Ethereum, but if you need Bitcoin for whatever reason then you need Bitcoin SPV client

We are engineers and look at blockchain primarily from technological POV. Once you get an SPV wallet for BTC you also get it for most of the forks. We are now expanding the same library to work with DASH and then will do same for LTC.  But the reality is that any Bitcoin based blockchain (soft/hard forks ) can now these libraries to fairly easily allow developers to build apps on top. 
Whether you take it seriously or not doesn’t really matter. The constructive opinion of blockchain developers is the only valid feedback here.
@_date: 2019-04-01 17:38:04
There is a lot of action both in BTC and Ethereum communities. A LOT of things are being built right these moments by small teams worldwide. The reality is that any serious software project takes a few years to build. Our ecosystem is in the building stage. Soon there will be a lot of decentralized apps, on all blockchains that have active development community.  
We are close to releasing full light client implementation (Swift/Kotlin) for Ethereum as well. Unfortunately, most of the DApps in Ethereum ecosystem now are not as decentralized as they may seem or claim to be because most do not communicate with nodes directly but via offchain party.

If it remains in mempool for two weeks it will be automatically dropped by the nodes.  
Now, when that happens your wallet needs to be able to identify that event as well. Most wallets are not able to handle that. The way around that is to restore your wallet by reimporting the private keys into the wallet app.  
@_date: 2019-09-18 06:21:54
Every Bitcoin transaction goes through following stages:
**PENDING PHASE: Sending transaction**
User clicks on Send button in the wallet app. Transaction ALMOST instantly reaches most of the nodes on the Bitcoin network. Each nodes places the transaction in so called "mempool".
This phase should be nearly instant in most wallets. At the end of this phase most network nodes that store blockchain and process transactions already have the transaction in the queue but not included it in the blockchain (history of transactions) yet.
When the transaction is sent the recipient will see it as pending in transactions list within a couple seconds. While it remains pending it's still potentially possible for the sender to modify/cancel the transaction.
**CONFIRMATION PHASE: Transaction waiting to be included in blockchain**
Transaction added to the blockchain and becomes confirmed. That usually happens within 10 minutes but can take loner as well. There are two factors which can affect the amount of time for the transaction to be confirmed:
* the transaction fee set by the sender
* the amount of pending transactions in the network
When the number of transactions in the network exceeds the amount of transactions nodes can process, nodes get to choose which transactions to include first. In general, nodes prefer to give priority to transactions which pay higher fee.   
Most good wallet apps would take the current network conditions into account and would recommend the optimal fee to the sender on the Sent screen itself.
If the fee was sufficient then it will most likely be confirmed within 10 minutes. That's why setting the fee properly is important, especially for larger payments that need to happen quickly.
**FINAL PHASE: Waiting for 3-6 blocks to pass**
After the transaction was included in the block it's fairly safe to assume that it's final and completed. However due to the nature how Bitcoin network operates it's generally recommended to wait somewhere between 3-6 blocks to pass before the transaction can be considered final and irreversible.  


Most wallets will show the transaction as final after 3/6 blocks has passed. For some wallets even 1 confirmation is enough for transaction to be shown as final.

judging by your requirements you basically needs storage for keeping order book and matching orders. For that you can use IPFS, decentralized storage.

**If you keep bitcoins on exchange:**
* It means the exchange keeps them for you on their account. they give username and password so that you can send them instructions like withdrawing/depositing bitcoins.
* The risk here is for exchange tone hacked or for them to scam everyone by telling that they were hacked. They also can freeze/restrict your account for whatever reason. All of the risks mentioned are fairly common.
* If someone somehow gets hold of your username/password to access the exchange you will loose your funds because the attacker will withdraw Bitcoins elsewhere. It's not possible to reverse Bitcoin transactions. Note that some senior level administrators on the exchange probably have full access to your account. The point I am trying to make you kind of have to trust them not to be evil... :)
**If you keep your bitcoins on some wallet that gives you (and only you) access to your private key.**
* In that case you're the only one with access. No one but you (as owner of the key) can transfer Bitcoins belonging to that private key.
* The risk here is that you may loose the key or expose it to someone who can then reenter that key in some other wallet and get control of your Bitcoins.
**Ownership of bitcoins is the ownership of the key that controls those bitcoins.**
If you're looking for the good wallet that gives you full control of your key and fairly easy to use I recommend, Unstoppable wallet [

* the wallet will restore segwit transactions from blockchain correctly, both segwit and non-segwit.
* after restore, the wallet will be able to send segwit transactions correctly.
* BUT a new user (the one that set up a new wallet from scratch) is not able to receive segwit transactions because the wallet doesn't show him segwit formatted addresses. This is going to be enabled in the next release.

It does. it's not enabled in the RECEIVE interface (yet!) for the reason because it would make the "restore of wallet" problematic in case user decides to move to some other wallet after transacting in this wallet.   
This shouldn't be taken lightly because the user needs to be able to restore funds entirely, regardless of which transactions they came from or the wallet they use. So we are thinking of ways of conveying that to the user in the interface so that the user may choose between the addresses (1 /3 ) and understand the consequences of those actions. Giving user a segwit address is not a problem (it's already done, we just don't show it). The problem is that it would then significantly limit user in terms of options when moving to another wallet that doesn't fully support the protocol yet.  
In Unstoppable Wallet the segwit capability is enabled by default and  the wallet will restore all past transactions correctly, both old and segwit ones. That's not the case in most wallets.  
The only part that is disabled for the time being is to enable user to receive funds to a segwit address and this is being worked on in terms of design. It's not just a matter of changing the address because the user needs to understand the consequences of using segwit.
